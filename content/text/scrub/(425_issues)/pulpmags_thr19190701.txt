the thrill book

our july fifteenth number

murray leinster has exceeded his usual mastery of fiction in a novelette we are
going to rive you in our next number it is called a thousand degrees
below zero imagine an enemy of the human race  a great scientist
who understands all natural laws and who shrewdly conceives a plan by which he can tie up
the traffic of every harbor in the world closes the panama canal destroys his enemies one
by one terrorizing the entire civilized world and defeats all attempts to destroy him we
can easily say that it is the best thing of its land that has come to our hands not only does
the author understand the telling of a fascinating story but he has made a lifelong study of
science suppose you were walking along the wharf and suddenly you saw a monster ice-
berg floating down the hudson river a column of hot steam arising from the center and
as it moved along causing complete destruction of everything in its way what would you
do in this amazing novelette murray leinster has created the best example of pseudo-
scientific fiction that has yet appeared in the thrill book this is the kind of story that
you cant find in any other magazine now published in america what appealed to us was
the absorbing interest that holds the reader from the first line to the last here is an author
whom it will pay you to watch confidentially we may as well admit that we are going to
follow this novelette up in a few issues with another story dealing with an entirely different
situation but with the same astounding and fantastic background we advise you to order
the next issue of the thrill book from your newsdealer at once

    be sure and begin the new serial in this issue by h bed ford-jones the opium
ship is a swiftly moving dramatic yam this author is likewise a new acquisition on
the staff of the thrill hook his work has been appearing regularly in another large
periodical but following our usual policy of not allowing anything to stand in theway of
our getting the best on the market no matter what it costs or the amount of time it takes
we went out after h bed ford-jones made him an offer that he couldnt refuse  the
result a crackajack serial and later on a novelette that should make the tired reader sit
up and grip his chair

    may freud dickenson a writer at present living in india has sent us a bitof fiction
called the mate which is particularly interesting to those who care for stories dealing
with the mysterious and never-to-be-explained east it has a surprise at the end utterly
unlike any other thing of its kind

    bon mark lemon and clyde broadwell both have examples of their work in the july
fifteenth issue the former calls his striking story the whispering from the
ground the latter contributes the first of a series called tales of the double
man back to earth by r r baker and room  by will s gidley are
stories by unknown writers it is the policy of the thriix book to stand behind any out-
of-the-rut story that comes along no matter who writes it or where it is written the
poniard of charlotte corday by francois de vallient contains a unique
situation

    in the july fifteenth issue the serial by john r coryell comes to an end stras-

the fiddler

sir gerald fitzjohn de courcy des-
mond k o m g d s o
late flight commander in that sec-
tion of his majestys royal flying
corps operating in papuan waters was
dead broke and knew it what was
more to the point be was drtmk and
did not know it

  this surprising even tragic event
happened in manila gerald desmond
had been in the city a week upon his
way home without taking a drink he
was not what is termed a drinking man
drinking men do not succeed in naval
hydroplane work at least to the extent
of winning honors

  but upon this amazing afternoon
while gerald desmond was playing
bridge at the english club in the paco
section of town he had received a ca-
blegram this cable message informed
him that his uncles fortune had de-
parted  that his uncle a worthy baro-
net of manufacturing fame in dublin
had departed on the heels of the for-
tune and that he gerald desmond
was now a baronet without an income
he had resigned his commission when
the war ended and had now neither
job nor money

  having settled his bridge score he
found fifty dollars in his pocket and
of this he devoted the major portion
to the bar thus at nine-ten upon
that historic evening he wandered to


the opium ship

the cloakroom pursued by a waiter
with a forgotten drink

  sure  take it said desmond
smiling brightly when the waiter gained
his attention heres good luck to ye
lad and many tips will ye have a
bit drink yourself now

  the respectable china boy refused
with a blank stare

  desmond allowed the attendant to
help him into his overcoat it was a
chilly night a plain black scarf cov-
ered his neckwear and white shirt
front a black crush hat concealed his
awkwardly red hair an ebony stick
fell over his arm

  will i call a cab sir asked the
attendant delicately or a taxi 

 ye will not said desmond
shocked would you insinuate that
i cannot walk

  he left the attendant coughing apol-
ogetically and made his way to the
street he was in a happy inward glow
and did not feel a bit sorry for him-
self indeed he felt rather rejoiced
over the knowledge that he could fol-
low a crack in the sidewalk with per-
fect accuracy and aplomb

  thunder o finn he exclaimed
joyously theres somethin in havin
irish blood after all-to say nothin
of havin a brewer for an uncle rest
his soul

  he directed his steps toward the
manila hotel which lies just beyond
the luneta but the fresh night air
gave him such an insidiously false idea
of his condition that he changed his
direction with the idea of getting a
drink at the elks or the army and
navy so he struck off down calle
isaac peral but by the time he had
passed the cathedral he began to ob-
serve that there was something subtly
and decidedly wrong with the sidewalk
stffl he forged ahead only to come to
a halt when he reached the del pilar
tramway line there he leaned on his
stick with patient resignation

  presently he became aware that some
one was accosting him hat in hand
with something of an effort desmond
forced himself into coherent observa-
tion the man had a violin case under
his arm and a wild tangle of black
locks fell about his ears at odd angles
his face was pinched his eyes veiy
bright and sharp and erratic

  its a fine gentleman ye are sir
was saying the man in an admiring
tone and a musician as i can see
by the face of you with me eyes shut
now then would ye be refusing a
brother musician as one gentleman to
another a bit matter of a loan ye
would not as i can see plainly

  eh demanded desmond whats
your name

  my name is it well now id be
tellin ye in confidence between gentle-
men sir that its from a great line
i come it is that sir though ye might
not believe it to be lookin at me here
michael terence osullivan by your

leave sir-

  aye said desmond that would
be the osullivan beare now twas
a great man he was and no mistake
but my lad if its comparing him to

the geraldines-

  lord save us cried osullivan
starting back youre from the old
country 

  im not sure said desmond can-
didly im sure of nothing some-
thins happened in these parts since this
afternoon an earthquake likely six
times have i had the notion of crossin
the street and each time thered come
a rattling tram threatening to run the
life out o me if i budged thunder
o finn and look at the sidewalk
with the roll to it

  sure now ill be taking ye home
said the fiddler insinuatingly then
well speak o that bit loan on the way
to-

  loan is it repeated desmond
heaven help ye lad its no loan
the opium ship



yell get from me for so long as me
credit is good  boy ye a drink or

  a fine gentleman like you broke 
gasped osullivan

  divil take it am i to blame if me
uncle left me not a shilling demanded
desmond with indignation but wait
give me your arm osullivan beare
like a good lad and leave it to me
is that the band i hear playin over
beyond at luneta park

  it is returned the other bitterly
and wholl give a dime to hear osul-
livan fiddle when the band is playin
they drownded me out for a fact
drownded me out they did--

  an insult declared desmond with
severity your arm me lad now
hush not a word out of ye-not a
word insult the osullivan beare
will they a little brown constab-stab-
ulary band insult the osullivan and
me standing by never n-never
sir gerald fitzjohn de courcy des-
mond will never-

  holy mother gasped the fiddler
sure i thought the fine face of ye
looked familiar twas pictured in all
the papers but sir dont be inter-
ferin with the crowd now let me be

takin you toward-

  desmond gripped the mans arm
firmly not a word he said hush
your blather or ill smash that fiddle
over your head guide me straight
now and mind none o those lamp-posts
swing at ye as we pass

  the luneta was crowded that eve-
ning as usual the constabulary band
was playing from the stand and along
the oval strolled officers and ladies
business men and their families bow-
ing senors and mantillaed senoritas
brown and white of all degrees made
up the gay throng while the sea breezes
lifted the band music in drifting waves
across the chatter of tongues

on the outskirts of the crowd two
men occupied a bench and they were

a strange couple one was a native
dressed in the most impeccable evening
attire from silk hat to patent leathers
the pearl studs in his shirt were elo-
quent of wealth the otfffir man was
roughly dressed and was dour of as-
pect he pulled on a clay pipe as he
talked and his smooth-shaven features
were stem and sour there was noth-
ing weak about them

  i tell you senor arevalo said this
second man that pm done with it
understand ill never run in another
load o dope for you nor any other man
alive otherwise im willin to oblige
but if ye bring one card aboard u
throw ye over the side

  th filipino laughed one guessed
at suave strength in his brown finely
chiseled face one imagined an inward
man of steel finely tempered like the
gold-inlaid steel of the moros

  my dear captain he said i assure
you that i shall not smuggle all i de-
sire is to be taken as a passenger on
this trip let us be frank i know
that you hesitate because you are to
take your owner and his daughter down
to remedios plantation well then i
shall not even be seen by them i have
business on the island there and since
youre sailing to-night it will help me
immensely to get off at once that is
all

  all right said the captain as
though impelled against his better judg-
ment for old times sake then
youd best have your dunnage aboard
by midnight for well sail on the turn
o the tide ill have to pick up a
couple o men before then too

  natives queried the other rising
a hint of eagerness was in his voice

  no i want white men and lord
knows where ill get em if it were
the old days now all fine and good
but with this law an order a man never
knows whats what

  the filipino laughed softly and dis-
appeared in the crowd the captain


the opium ship

leaned back sucking at his pipe and
watching the band stand so it hap-
pened that he witnessed a most extraor-
dinary thing

  the bandmaster came to the front
of the stand and held up his hand until
the crowd fell silent through curiosity

  ladies and gentlemen he an-
nounced sir gerald desmond of the
royal flying corps has asked to make
an announcement regarding a hitherto
unknown atrocity of the late war which
has come under his observation i am
sure you will all be very glad to hear
from so distinguished a gentleman one
who has achieved great fame as an
aviator and whose name will be known
to many of you

  as the bandmaster ceased and bowed
the crowd broke into instant applause
coming to the front of the platform was
desmond it was observed that he had
removed hat and coat and that he held
a second man firmly by the arm it
was also observed that the members of
the band seemed fully as puzzled as
every one else

  when desmond bowed and his flash-
ing smile lighted his aggressive finely
carved features the applause redoubled
it died down when he raised his hand

  my friends his rich voice carried
clearly to the staring throng below
this is one of the happiest moments
of me life i assure you tis so on
this momentous evening it has fallen
to me to make right a great wrong that
has been done to one of the finest gen-
tlemen under gods creation it has
that

  the charming informality of this ad-
dress was such that a vague suspicion
was impressed upon his auditors but
desmond recaptured them with his
smile and continued

  here beside me and he jerked for-
ward the rather abashed fiddler ye
behold a victim an irishman like me-
sdf an artist of the first water its
the truth im telling you so listen now

osullivan beare is the name of him
and any irishman present will recall
the glorious life an death of that grand
gentleman who has been playin the
fiddle all this while in your midst only
to be drowned miserably night after
night by the glorious discords of this
constab-stabulary band by whose leave
im addressing you

  desmond paused for breath the
rising storm of laughter died instantly
as he proceeded

  my friends for the sake o fair
play im asking you one and all to
stand by and see no interference done
while this gentleman entertains us its
a strugglin member of an oppressed
race he is and when ye consider the
jealousy which has led the constab-
stabulary band to be drownin him out
night after night while his unhappy
country is starvin for the hapence and
dimes which he should be sendin home
to help beat the kaiser and establish
democracy in the land of erin-well
its all true anyhow i have every re-
spect for the stars an shtripes in fact
im intendin to become an american
citizen now that me uncle is dead and
me without a shilling to me name but

i wiu-

  desmond turned indignantly to his
companion why the divil dont ye
play dye expect me to stand here
blathering all night until ye get tuned
up  play ye divil play or ill smash

that fiddle-

  at this point the scandalized band-
master touched desmonds elbow
what he said was lost in the roars of
mirth that swept over the luneta the
situation was perfectly clear to every
one by this time yet so cool and easy
was desmond that to imagine him

drunk-

  when the bandmaster was through
speaking desmond tooklhe conductors
baton from under his arm lifted the
uni formed gentleman by the collar and
with one hand dropped him over the
the opium ship



edge of the stand then he turned

to the bandsmen

  now ye brown divils strike up
the wearin of the green and mind
ye follow this baton or to murder ye
when me friend here gets into tune
see that ye dont drown him out thun-
der o finn are ye goin to play or
not 

  the constabulary band banished its
gfrins and seized its instruments the
luneta was a shrieking howling mass
of joyous humanity through which the
constabulary officers tried vainly to
reach the band stand and then the
band started playing

  michael terence osullivan began to
enter into the spirit of the occasion
he whipped out fiddle and bow and
with a wild grin on his pinched face
fell to scraping away the brown musi-
cians such of them as could play for
laughing answered desmonds baton
with a pianissimo and for one intoxi-
cating moment osullivan was at the
apogee of his ambition

  an instant later a flushed and pant-
ing constabulary officer appeared beside
desmond the latter turned to him
knocked him over the edge of the stand
after the conductor and calmly con-
tinued waving his baton this was
too much the law had been insulted
and the law demanded its victim after
all the bandsmen were constabulary

  osullivan saw the coming storm
he hastily stowed away his fiddle
tucked the case under his arm and
tried to escape but caught in the tide
of bandsmen he stood back to back
with desmond and fought valiantly
the end of course would never have
been in doobt had not some kindly
soul switched off the lights which
flooded the band stand

  there was a riot in the luneta that
night-a riot which became historic
gerald desmond was not at all certain
of what happened although he remem-
bered events fairly well up to the mo-

ment of concluding his speech it was
certain that when he reached the out-
skirts of the milling mob he was still
hanging to michael terence osulli-
van and the fiddler who had received
a tap over the head from a bassoon
and who was only half conscious still
clung to his beloved fiddle

  its a most successful evening ob-
served desmond vaguely pausing for
breath now what the divil went
with my collar upon me soul i do
believe i had a drink too many-

  a dark figure materialized at his el-
bow

  come on desmond said a voice
heres a cab waiting for you

  good responded sir desmond
though yell have to lend us your
arm for this man hangin to me dis-
turbs the street most amazingly
either hes drunk or i am-

  a powerful hand gripped his arm
and steadied him forward a brown
constabulary officer came shrieking up
to them but the unseen protector met
him with a blow that sent him under
a heap of shrubbery

  hurry along with you growled the
unknown

  sir gerald desmond felt himself
bundled into a cab falling in a heap
over the protesting michael terence
and the fiddle case after this all grew
dim

  order came gradually out of that
historic chaos and the authorities
combed the city for gerald desmond
who was now a baronet the manila
hotel disclaimed all knowledge of him
the fiddler osullivan a licensed beg-
gar who had once been honorably dis-
charged from the army by reason of
tuberculosis had likewise failed to turn
up at his lodgings

  the two men had completely van-
ished and naturally no one connected
this disappearance with the fact that
the inter-island trading schooner san


the opium ship

gregorio had left her berth at the
muelle shortly after midnight bound
for her owners plantation on mindoro
island

  upon the following day was raging
the worst typhoon which had struck
the islands in years an inbound sin-
gapore steamer reported that she had
sighted a schooner off lubang running
west before the gale at the end of a
week the san gregorio was accounted
lost the loss occasioned some com-
ment for aboard the schooner had been
her owner the wealthy don gregorio
salcedo y montes and his daughter
dona juliana the presumed widow
of don gregorio was prostrated by the
event

  it was remarked by the authorities
that about this time disappeared one
senor juan arevalo-somewhat to
their relief arevalo was a native of
great ability a member of the legis-
lature from cavite who had made much
money in devious ways the consump-
tion of opium fell off noticeably after
his disappearance and he left no family
to mourn him so taken all in all
the authorities were very glad that he
had vanished

chapter ii

the schooner-

fhe agonies of gerald desmonds
awakening to reality were har-
rowing but need be lightly dwelt upon
they had much to do with the filthy
forecastle of the so gregorio with
violent seasickness with huge cock-
roaches with brief but tender minis-
trations from a pinched-faced little
man with a hacking cough and with
a terrific visitation from no less a per-
son than captain miles canaughan

  when i need all hands i need em
concluded the skipper caustically but
im makm some allowance for your
condition my man so ye have until
eight bells to pull up if youre not on

deck at four oclock by your wrist
watch gawd help ye

  desmond merely groaned and col-
lapsed in a throe of nausea captain
canaughan punctuated his remarks un-
wisely with two hearty kicks in the
ribs

  i pulled you out o trouble he fin-
ished so dont try no shanghaied talk
to me i know yere a gentleman and
i mean to make ye work its my guess
that youre a papistical south of ireland
man for which ive no love so then
mind your eye

  by six bells in the afternoon des-
mond knew all there was to know about
his situation the crew numbered six
all of them riffraff white men none
of them americans lying white and
weak in his bunk desmond heard two
of them talking they had slid below
to swallow pannikins of hot coffee in
comparative peace

  there was only one mate to the little
schooner-a half-caste-famous for his
brawn and his knowledge of the islands
little osullivan was being badly
mauled above decks and the men
laughed at mention of the fiddler des-
mond writhed in his bunk as the talk
reached him and cursed his own help-
less plight he was clad in the rem-
nants of his evening attire

  a little time thereafter michael ter-
ence osullivan slipped down into the
empty focsle with two ijiugs of boil-
ing coffee he forced one of them on
desmond the fiddler was blue with
cold and there was a purpling bruise
across his cheek

  lord help you  he observed be-
tween coughs dragging his ragged coat
about his throat bitter cold outside
it is you in the skippers watch me
in the mates blowin the guts out o
hell sir just that

  desmond sipped at the steaming
fluid which gave him warmth and life

  what are you coughing for osul-
livan he asked suddenly
the opium ship



  t b sir responded the fiddler
with a sharp look thats how i come
to be sthranded in the islands worse
luck discharged from the army i
was

  and what the divil are we going
to do aboard this bloody-minded
craft

  we might do worse than take
charge of her ourselves and the fid-
dler laughed with a touch of impudent
deviltry theres a lady aft they say
and a couple o fine brown gentlemen
but its seasick ye are sir and seasick

yell stay for three days-

  not i returned desmond divil
a bit was i ever seasick in me life lad
its the smells and last nights liquor
listen now how did ye come aboard
here if i remember right you werent
drunk last night

  somebody had to be lookin afther
you was the response besides there

was the po-lice back yonder-

  you osullivan roared a billow-
ing thunderous voice from the hatch-
way come out o that you rat
sanqre de dios ill show you some-
thing

  the fiddler made an abrupt dive for
his bunk in which by some miracle his
fiddle case still reposed feverishly he
snapped open the case and slipped
something out of it then turned as the
giant bulk of the mate filled the ladder

  leave me alone now he cried out
shrilly its warnin ye i am

  gerald desmond staggered to his feet
and stood clinging to a bunk before
the mate a brutal dog was this half-
caste hulking and broad-lipped who
looked at desmond with the glimmer-
ings of asian cruelty in his eyes

  so its the fine gentleman lie
laughed on deck with you

  im going said desmond reeling
a little but me man youre to leave
this lad alone understand  hes a sick

  on deck and mind your own busi-

ness  roared the mate furiously ill
kill the dirty dog before im through
with-

  desmond forced a blow weak as
he was he managed to get himself be-
hind it and the mate reeled then
with a startled oath the mate swept out
his hands and sent desmond hurtling
head first into a comer with a crash

  an instant later little osullivan
threw up his arm and the explosion
of a pistol filled the forecastle with
reeking fumes the mate shot squarely
betwreen the eyes lumped himself at
the foot of the ladder a great dead
hulk of flesh

  theres moren one way of fight-
ing shrieked osullivan with a wild
laugh

  desmond rose and wiped blood from
his lips he wasted no time in recrim-
inations or questions  he lashed his sick
brain into energy and faced facts

  the mate was dead who then was
on deck not the skipper the skipper
would take charge at eight bells-in
less than half an hour then why not
seize the ship as the fiddler had sug-
gested

  a laugh reeled from desmonds lips
as he faced the defiant osullivan

  well its done me lad now to pay
the piper have ye another o those
popguns  he indicated the cheap lit-
tle revolver so small that osullivans
hand almost concealed it ive not
much use for a gun ordinarily but at
the present moment  admit that-w

  he has one in his coat pocket he
did be smashin me with the butt cried
the fiddler pointing at the dead man
what will you be doin sir its a
hangin job for me now-

  for both of us im thinkm said
desmond coolly he stooped over the
mate and rose with a brutal automatic
in his hand whos going to do the
hanging eh  thats the question
now osullivan if i had a bit of a
drink it might put life into me-ah f
io

the opium ship

thunder o finn its a magic fiddle ye
have there

  with a grin osullivan plunged
again for his fiddle case and presently
held up a small flask desmond took
it and drank

  ah he exclaimed returning the
flask this was a case of necessity
lad

  and what was last night then
queried the other whimsically

  a case o damn foolishness des-
monds smile was shadowy though
cheering now lets go ye may
have to lend me a hand on deck but
i think i can weather it the skippers
aft

  aye osullivan was eager wist-
fully marveling youre goin for
him

  just that desmond indicated the
body of the mate its hit or be hit
me friend after this make no mis-
take we have to hit every mortal
head that shows aft never mind the

poor divils forard-

  will you be waiting now a min-
ute osullivan caught desmonds
arm a quick struggle in his pinched
features i shot him without thinkin
sir but when it comes to goin against
them aft and the lady an all why

i dont-

  desmond comprehended and with
a sudden wild laugh clapped the little
man on the shoulder

  oh its a murdering divil ye thought
me eh well osullivan or rather
michael terence ive never planned to
kill a man in me life so have no fears
and as for the lady god bless her
sweet face well take good care of her
come along with you before the whisky
dies out o me and the nausea comes
back i think the clean air will blow
me fine an strong again

  he stepped over the mates body and
went up the ladder at the deck he
paused aghast partly through a gust

of weakness that smote him and partly
at the sight which met his eyes

  the little schooner under a scant rag
of storm sail was boring into the west-
ern sky down upon her out of the
south and east was pouring the hurri-
cane-such a storm of wind and rain
as almost blew the waves flat sup-
pressed them into an oily scum of froth
and whirling waters hurled the tiny
craft as though from some giant hand
soon enough the rain would cease the
sea would rise and the battle begin
but for the moment was comparative
respite

  desmond clawed his way aft along
the starboard rail three or four of
the crew were visible flattened out in
sheltered corners these eyed him curi-
ously yet without menace behind him
followed osullivan long black locks
blowing in the wind as he progressed
desmond noted that the schooner was
no dirty little island trader but well
appointed the whaleboats were new
and well found at the galley door
the face of a chinaman appeared for
an instant and almost caused desmond
to halt for it was the straight-eyed face
of a manchu and no son of han

  they were at the after companion
now a single figure stood at the wheel
in the stem-a wild giant statue of a
man locked against the spokes by the
following wind the hatches were
ready to be clapped on when it became
necessary with a last glance at the
storm wrack in the sky desmond
fought his way to the ladder and
plunged down into peace and obscurity
a moment later the fiddler panting
hard joined him

  the two men advanced ignorant
where they were to find theirprey as
they hesitated however a door opened
and the figure of a man lurched out in
front of them and pounded at another
door

  capn  it called oh capn
youd better open up and-
the opium ship

ii

  desmond leaned forward and his
arm swept out the automatic butt first
the man dropped without a word a
swarthy lean excellently dressed man

  it aint the ladys father anyhow
said osullivan clawing at the figure
i seen him with her last night this
one now-

  he produced an automatic nodded
as though satisfied and awaited instruc-
tions

  desmond tried the skippers door
found it locked he rapped sharply

  whos there sounded the skippers
harsh tones four bells eh 

  four bells sir responded the fid-
dler with a wink to desmond

  the door opened with a jerk des-
mond stepped in and his automatic lay
under the nose of captain canaughan

  back and sit down you he com-
manded simply

  for the love o heaven growled
the amazed and disgruntled skipper
falling back if it aint the popish
lad-

  papist yerselfl came the fiddlers
whining snarl from behind desmond
its an honest orangeman i am but
with no love for a belfast scut like
erself go on ye scots tarrier

  the brawny skipper ostentatiously
threw up his hands but he also threw
up one boot desmond however had
been watching for just such a move
he countered the kick with his knee
and shin and captain canaughan ut-
tering a stifled groan went back against
his bunk he clung there for a mo-
ment

  bruk my leg you did he said with
a grimace of pain

  not yet and desmond grinned
but i will the next time shut the
door michael terence and drag that
lump o clay inside

  look here cried out the skipper
suddenly this is mutiny dye know
that theres none to take charge of
this ship but me-

  youre right there skipper said
desmond coolly weve just shot your
mate and now well shoot you and have
done with it

  for an instant the skippers sturdy
face blanched then looking desmond
in the eye he relaxed and sat down on
the edge of his bunk

  i should ha known better last
night he said mournfully oh have
ye killed poor arevalo too weil no
matter the ship will go down any
minute now

  elucidate  desmond felt his head
beginning to reel again in the closeness
of the cabin whos this arevalo
whos the lady

  captain canaughan elucidated and
were driving along with no one to
handle the ship if youve killed the
mate he concluded sourly

  hes a pretty boy said desmond
inspecting the filipino michael ter-
ence  call two of the men from above
and have him carried forard let him
take a hand at the work

the fiddler grinned and departed
canaughan uttered a growling protest
look here this aint legal youll

hang for this killin-

 legal my eye said desmond
cheerfully what land are we head-
ing for

  the skipper glanced at the telltale
headin for point galera and min-
doro unless were driftin much in
an hour itll be mowin the sticks out
of her well need the engine to get
into the lee o lubang or cape cala-
vite then well fetch mamburu well
enough

  in other words were heading
south desmond frowned as if puz-
zled well will you pass me your
word to take my orders and to leave
me and osullivan unmolested 

  i will not returned canaughan
promptly ive me duty to the owners
to consider and im a righteous man
ye cant escape sea law desmond a


the opium ship

little craft like this even is harried
down most amazing if theres a thing
wrong that murder will hang ye it
does all very well in pirate stories but
this is no book mind all this sort o
thing-

  you dont compliment my brains
but fll surprise you there skipper
replied desmond a knock sounded
at the door come in

  osullivan and the two men ap-
peared desmond cocked his eye at the
skipper

  put arevalo forard he said softly
and in five minutes ye can go on deck

free and unharmed otherwise-

he gestured with the weapon in his
hand

  carry that man forard ordered
the skipper empty a bucket over
him

  the two men departed bearing the
limp figure of arevalo between them
swinging to the lurch of the vessel

  ive not the heart to be shooting
ye skipper said desmond simply
also im in a bad way so get out
o here with me blessing and dont
come back stay above

  canaughan started dont come
back and what does that mean
then

  what it says have ye a gun on
your person 

  no the skippers eye rolled long-
ingly toward a desk in the comer

  then go ahead im thinking that
we have more or less of a monopoly
on the firearms aboard show the skip-
per out michael terence and mind his
boot

  mutiny this is rank mutiny said
the skipper hoarsely his face purpling
yeil hang for it i warn ye

  ah but whos to do the hanging
desmond laughed and gestured toward
the door youll not be needing your
cozy cabin skipper dear if youll take
my advice youll get those hatches bat-
tened down in a hurry one good fol-

lowing sea will sink this walnut shell
of a ship so run up like a good fel-
low r

  a torrid exclamation which did not
partake of righteousness fell from
captain canaughan as the grinning fid-
dler opened the door and bowed mock-
ingly then the skipper was gone

  desmond relaxed in the bunk

  lock the door michael terence
and make sure o the bolts he said
help yourself to the skippers cloth-
ing lad and get warm wake me in
a couple of hours but not before on
the life of you and no whisky lad
were done with that eh 

  but ive left me fiddle up forard
protested osullivarf fiercely his eyes
widening with dismay oh mhuire
as truaghf me old fiddle that id not
be losin for a mint o money-

  leave it be lad said desmond
drowsily theyll batten on the
hatches now and the fiddle will be safe
ill warrant you in two hours mind
ill-

  he rolled back in the bunk osul-
livan locked and bolted the door

chapter iii

arevalo takes charge

en captain miles canaughan
got on deck he found himself
confronted by a situation entirely out
of his experience and which laid him
completely aback

  for one thing the san gregorio was
not at all on the course indicated by
the telltale in his cabin she was driv-
ing before the wind and she was driv-
ing almost due west by three-quarters
south the mate had given these or-
ders four hours previously when the
skipper had gone below said the helms-
man-a great norseman named balder-
son the mate however was dead
and no one else could explain these or-
ders

  for another thing the schooner car-
the opium ship



ried an auxiliary gasoline engine and
when mr canaughan ordered this
started he found it completely and effi-
ciently smashed what was worse the
skippers vigilant eye presently discov-
ered that the small launch carried for-
ward in place of one of the boats pos-
sessed a tarpaulin which was flapping
the lashings of the tarp had been cut
and the launchs engine had also been
put beautifully out of commission

  some one had wrecked the two en-
gines and some one had interfered with
the telltale who was guilty and why
there was no answer the men all
island riffraff with the exception of
balderson protested absolute innocence
and ignorance and canaughan was
constrained to believe them the mate
was obviously guilty of setting a false
course and therefore must be to blame
for the wrhoie business

  bewildered seeing himself able to
blame desmond for only a part of his
own helpless position with the hurri-
cane wallowing down and the schooner
going to the devil the skipper set him-
self to the job of saving his ship as
the sea was rising fast he fell to work
making a sea anchor which would hold
the san gregorio head to the wind and
would let her ride out the night she
seemed to be driving along the track
of singapore traffic so captain ca-
naughan got out his flags hoisted nc
and swore at his men to move lively

  at this juncture the dripping figure
of juan arevalo approached him with
difficulty

  who hit me demanded the fili-
pino holding one hand to his injured
bead

  the skipper beckoned him into the
shelter of the deck house and briefly
shouted that two of the crew had muti-
nied and were even now snugly en-
sconced in the skippers cabin juan
arevalo had already seen the mates
body slipped over the rail just before
the focsle hatch was battened down

but now he caught canaughans arm
and laid his lips to the skippers ear
his face livid under its swarthy hue
worked desperately

  ive got to get below in a hurry
he shouted

  the skipper grinned in a sneer
stay where y are he bawled no
time to fool with ye now got to--

  arevalos keen features contorted in
a sudden passion of anger

  i said i was going below he re-
peated furiously you fool every-
thing may be done by this time-juli-
ana-

  canaughan gave him a shsrp look
what dye mean ye promised me
thered be no smuggling this trip well
anyhow you stay here well be need-
ing you soon enough

  a frightful cry broke from arevalo
he shouted at two of the men working
a few feet away at his call they
leaped up without warning arevalo
swung his fist against the face of the
incredulous skipper

  canaughan with a bellow of rage
rushed for the filipino but his two men
got in the way one of them flung
himself at canaughans legs the other
whacked the skipper over the head with
a club

  the skipper had looked for no such
mutinous play as this the treachery
caught him unawares and he sprawled
senseless on the deck before he quite
knew what had happened arevalo
searched him for a weapon but vainly
and leaped up with a stormy fury in
his keen handsome features

  throw him below forward he or-
dered and get the battens off the
after companion ill have to go
down

  wait one of the men caught at
his arm with a glance aft balderson
aint in on the deal we aint had time
to fix him

  arevalo glanced at the helmsman
then laughed grimly go and cut the


the opium ship

ropes from the wheel hell stay there
then for if he left the helm the
schooner would broach and go under
ill be back and interview balderson
before you get the sea anchor out
sabe 

  two more of the men were called
the body of captain canaughan was
carried forard while arevalo ran with
the other two men to the after com-
panion as though some furious impulse
spurred him to get below

  balderson his viking figure straining
at the helm bellowed to the other men
m frantic fury for one of them had
cut the ropes and leave the wheel now
he dared not they laughed at him
yet in their laughter was fear of the
skies and sea dread in the shaking rig-
ging above them the weak confusion
of uncaptained men balderson roared
to close the hatches again but they
ignored him for arevalo had gone be-
low aft and as they waited circling
about balderson at the helm they drew
gold from their pockets and grinned
at the norseman and balderson be-
ing no fool fell silent and waited

  so the ship drove open to the seas
leaderless while ever the thunderous
masses of water piled up astern and
swept below upheaving the careening
schooner as they tossed her into the
heavens foaming away again ahead of
her the tiny rag of storm sail thrusting
her onward like a wild thing

  presently the torso of juan arevalo
rose from the after companion way and
he beckoned the nearest men his face
was deathly white and his dark eyes
blazed with strange fires now as al-
ways these island ruffians stood in awe
of his keen intellect and the infernal
energy that drove him like some inward
lash

  send balderson to me he shouted
as they bent closer his eyes darted to
windward searched the sky and sea
turning he swept the horizon then
he dropped into the passage below and

waited a revolver in his hand a mo-
ment later balderson relieved from the
helm awkwardly swung through the
opening and half fell down the ladder
as a hissing comber swept the vessel
high and twisted her against the helm

  stand quiet you said arevalo
covering the big man down here out
of the smothering wind one could speak
and be heard i had no chance to see
you last night do you want to earn
five hundred gold with a hundred
down in advance speak quickly

  the norseman wiped the brine from
his beard looked into the revolver
mouth and assented

  sure

  the mate was in with me said
arevalo picking his english words
carefully but he was killed so we
must keep the skipper until later to
navigate you will see that he is tied
up and stowed away in the forecastle
eh 

  sure and balderson nodded heav-
ily then he grinned a little im glad
the mate is gone but the owner
senor salcedo

  a slight tremor seemed to pass over
arevalos countenance a rippling
quiver as though somewhere inside of
him the steel soul had buckled ever so
little then he smiled thinly

  the don is dead he said with quiet
precision no i didnt do it twas
those two men who killed the mate
theyre barricaded in the captains
cabin now and they can stay there for
a while well batten the hatches pres-
ently they must have stunk him out
-shoved some chinese punk under his
door it killed him dona juliana is
unconscious and sick but safe

  balderson looked steadily at the
speaker for a moment

  thats why you were in such a hell
of a hurry to get below huh  he said
frowning in ponderous concentration
you were afraid she would be killed
too huh
the opium ship



  arevalos handsome features again
showed that indefinable tremor he
had not thought that balderson would
so quickly perceive the truth but he
did not attempt further lies

  yes he said with his deadly air
of quiet yzsf youre right but im go-
ing to keep the cap vs log-and tjiose
other two men did it understand
balderson scratched his head slow
admiration dawned in his blue eyes

  the log then ye mean to shove
along 

  of course arevalo showed impa-
tience dont you understand that
everything has to be proper theyre
responsible for the mate ill make
them responsible for everything else
including the broken engines

  and-dona juliana

  marries me when we pick up the
islands

  again balderson scratched his head
cant keep it quiet he said heavily
too many in it me and the other
five men

  arevalo smiled his teeth were very
white and even

  im telling-you they wont know
the rest theyre afraid of me and
theyll keep quiet besides they put
the capn below and theyll be quick
enough to let the two in the cabin be
blamed and ask no questions

  balderson nodded with ponderous
unraveling of thought

  seems all right discharge all
hands at mindoro huh and get em
shipped out on the first ship huh all
right we know you got the brains
arevalo but whats the idea of run-
nin this course this wind now shes
bad

  the storm will suit us well enough
returned arevalo i have the chart
and the mate picked out the course
if the wind falls by to-morrow noon-
and it will fall this blow is a quick
puff-well be all right sure theres
a reason leave it to me one thou

sand extra to all hands if everything
goes off well

 the norsemans frown cleared
thats good good huh

  it ought to be send down two men
to bring up senor salcedo tell them
he was killed by those two devils down
here then well batten down every-
thing

  and dona juliana

  ill lock her in her cabin shes
too sick to bother us until night any-
way we can come down to-night and
put the two men in irons if they give
trouble then make her comfortable
leave that to me

  you got brains huh said balder-
son admiringly and held out his big
hand shake

  smiling arevalo shook hands with
him then the norseman leaped to the
deck above and swung his arm to the
nearest of the men but arevalo
standing under the ladder below did
not see a dark figure that slipped off
into the shadows of the passage nor
did he detect the opening and shutting
of the captains cabin door

  michael terence osullivan sidled
into the cabin shut locked and bolted
the door and then dropped into a cor-
ner and propped himself against the
pitch of the schooner he produced a
dirty handkerchief and wiped his face
-and again the cold sweat was
breaking out upon him endlessly and
cowardice was wringing his soul since
the days when the white plague had
weakened him and stripped him of his
own osullivan had come to calling
himself a coward and there was a
fleck of red on his lips as he held down
a cough

  he had stolen out meaning to have
a try for that beloved fiddle of his and
he had all but walked upon arevalo
standing there below the companion
ladder and he had heard the conver-
sation with balderson as a result
osullivan was now sweating for his
i

the opium ship

skin and for the skin of gerald des-
mond who was fast asleep and snoring

  with a final swipe at his brow the
fiddler pulled himself erect

  god help us all he said softly
with a sob in his throat that told the
words for a prayer outside he could
hear a trampling of feet in the passage
he went to the desk in the corner and
sat there presently he opened up the
desk and began to go through it sys-
tematically but he did not wake des-
mond for the time was far from up
that desmond had set

  after he had rifled the skippers desk
to his satisfaction containing nothing
more lootable than thirty dollars in
american bills osullivan went to the
passage door and after listening a mo-
ment opened it outside all was dark
arevalo and his men had gone the
hatches were on fast

  already there was a perceptible dif-
ference in the movement of the ship
she no longer rose like a cork to the
waves but from the bows came heavy
crashes the sea anchor was out and
now she was sullenly heading into the
wind and welter while the seas smashed
into her bows and swept her foredeck

  arevalo is facin the work of it
anyhow muttered osullivan shaking
his head a bad one he is all this
is crazy mans work yet the lad is as
cool-blooded about it as a scot aye
hes a bad one im thinkin

  wrinkling up his nose at a heavy
oppressive odor the fiddler set to work
exploring the cabins nothing re-
warded his search until he came to the
stern cabin and the door of this was
locked the key was in the lock so
he turned it and stepped inside

  he realized that this entire after end
of the cabin space had been converted
into an apartment for the owners use
the first cabin had no doubt been that
of senor salcedo it was heavy with
a sickening sweet and oppressive scent
the meaning of which had been made

plain to osullivan by the conversation
between arevalo and balderson al-
though the furnishings of this cabin
were luxurious the fiddler hastened on
to the interior chamber a large and
beautiful cabin plump in the schooners
stem that this had been the original
captains cabin was evidenced by the
trapdoor in the floor leading down into
the run where the ships cabin stores
were kept a curtained bed was in the
comer screwed to the floor

  the fiddler had outfitted himself with
warm clothes from the skippers cabin
and also with a sea cap now as he
advanced toward the bed he removed
his cap and was despite the lack of
observers quite obviously embarrassed
he drew aside the curtains of the bed
and blushed deeply but his lips tight-
ened with determination

  que qulere demanded a faint
voice then in english and with femi-
nine alarm who are you  what are
you doing here-

  one must admit candidly that few
men thus placed at the bedside of a
lady reared in the most severe castilian
tradition and finding themselves con-
fronted by the alarm and indignant
anger of that lady could have justified
their intrusion without a single word
michael terence osullivan it is true
was too overcome to speak but he
could smile and he did smile and in
the little pinched face of him in the
manner of his smile in the wild tangle
of hair and the piercing shrewd black
eyes there was a transfigurement it
is like that when some men smile all
the outward world-disfigured body of
them is forgotten and the soul shows
the fiddler had none of the cheerful
deviltry of desmonds laughter but in
his smiling face was something greater
and more powerful-a wistful coercion
a bashful appealing tenderness

  how did you get in here de-
manded dona juliana more quietly

  sure lady i walked said osulli-
the opium ship

i

van now dont be throubling the
sweet heart of you by fearin me but
if yell listen a bit iii have somethin
to tell ye mhuire as truagh but its
sorry i am to be havin such a story
to tell yourself its a sorry man i am
to be bringin the tears to the sweet

face of you lady-

  are you a madman or a fool  ex-
claimed the lady but her voice despite
her words was frightened by the omi-
nous tone of o-sullivan

  oh cried the fiddler its a lady
of the fairy folk ye are well my
heart is broke for ye but if ye must

have the truth-

  and he told her of all that arevalo
had done

  desmond wakened meantime to find
darkness come down on the cabin and
the door swinging ajar he crawled
out of the bunk and stretched himself
then observed that he was alone also
he was ravenously hungry and the sick-
ness had left him

  there was a scraping at the door and
osullivan entered

  oh its up you are sir the fid-
dler closed the door behind him

  lets have a light and some grub

exclaimed desmond if-

  whist now  let me be tellin you
everything first broke in the other
hurriedly the lady is dressin her-
self bless the sweet face of her as
well as she can for the tears and she
knows all about us and about her poor
father bein kilt in his sleep by that
murderous arevalo bad luck to him
and about the poor capn bein kilt

and-

  thunder o finn exclaimed des-
mond rubbing his eyes whats all
this

  its what im tryin to tell you sir
if yell give me half a chanct then
well go into the big cabin yonder and
maybe find a bit o grub and whilst
ye entertain the lady ill maybe have a

try for me poor old fiddle-

  atb

  stop it ordered desmond desper-
ately ye wild divil will ye begin
at the start and tell me whats hap-
pened how long have i slept

  a bit over two hours maybe more
returned osullivan now here his
sir i had a notion to find me fiddle
again but at the companion i saw

arevalo-

  he recounted all that he had over-
heard and followed it up by his con-
versation with dona juliana

  the sweet face of her vd bring
tears to your throat he concluded ear-
nestly and if we could be occupyin
them cabins our two selves wed have
more room besides all bein together
and when arevalo comes as he said

hed be cornin toward night-

  well be there eh struck in des-
mond

  you will be countered the other
but ill be waitin to pop out on deck
and maybe get that fiddle o mine im
tellin you the truth sir its mortal hard
to think o that sweet fiddle lyin for-
ard and maybe broke or hurt-

  go on with you and desmond
laughed as he pushed the fiddler to-
ward the door you have the right
idea michael terence lets get on
in there and light a lamp or two well
take care of dona juliana and dont
worry your head about arevalo sad-
dling any of his dirty work on us
come on

  crossing to the rear cabin desmond
lighted the big lamp slung in gimbals
and sniffed the heavy-sweet air as he
glanced around to one side were two
bunks against the wall a desk a small
bookcase a framed painting of a buxom
and half-veiled lady doubtless senora
salcedo a cupboard for clothes a
washstand nothing else a port had
been hooked open and flying spray had
wet the wall

  desmond went to the desk and
opened it by the confusion he guessed
that arevalo had been before him
i

the opium ship

however a small box of cheroots re-
mained and into this he dug as he
lighted one he was conscious that the
door to the inner cabin had opened
he turned to meet juliana salcedo y
montes and amazement grew within
him

chapter iv

canaughan bargains

qerald desmond had as much
knowledge of women as the next
man and was always willing to learn
more as he looked at juliana salcedo
he realized that she was the most beau-
tiful woman he had ever seen exoti-
cally beautiful yet marked with the
golden hair and gray eye of the purest
spanish blood her gown of palest
green island silk accentuated her high
coloring the rich curves of cheek and
arm and figure and withal she
seemed to be entirely poised

  this stammered michael terence
this is the desmond maam of whom

  was speakin

  desmond set his cap on the desk and
bowed

  if i were you madam he said a
gay smile deepening the humorous
wrinkles about his level eyes id sit
down every once in so often we get
thumped-and while id love to be help-
in you out of the comer id hate to see
you thrown there youre dona juli-
ana 

  yes she said quietly with only the
dark circles about her eyes to tell of
grief and illness she took the chair
which osullivan shoved forward un-
der the quiet scrutiny of her gray eyes
desmond felt startled their self-pos-
session after all she had just learned
was amazing

  desmond knew nothing of the pure
spanish breed cloistered apart from the
world in a narrow cell of straight-laced
prudery with fires deeply repressed yet
capable of volcanic eruptions at the

moment indeed it seemed to him that
this girl for all her amazing beauty was
like an icicle out of pity and warm
impulse he resolved to thaw the icicle

  thunder o finn  he swore to him-
self what a lovely job for ye ger-
ald

  juliana when she had finished her
scrutiny of his features nodded slightly
as though reassured by the man

  this she said evenly is a very
unfortunate situation sir you can
readily see that it is difficult for me
mr osullivan has explained every-
thing and it seems that he and you
must occupy this cabin

  to be sure returned desmond un-
concernedly michael terence me
lad go into the ladys cabin and lift
the trap in the floor yell find the
cabin stores stowed below im think-
ing get up something for dinner and
miss juliana will fix up a bit to eat
for us

  osullivan obeyed the gray eyes
of dona juliana flashed as though in
swift resentment desmond had en-
tirely ignored the compromising fea-
tures of the situation and yet his gay
smile was very infectious

  i am not accustomed to cooking

for- she began but desmond

waved his hand and broke in with a
disconcerting air of careless ease

  oh yell get used to it believe me
and meantime well make the best of
it he said puffing his cheroot alight
dye see miss juliana theres just
the three of us and we have to stick
together each one of us doing our bit
i happen to have a natural longing to
save my own neck so im in command
now then what about this man ar-
evalo have ye any idea why he
should have murdered your poor
father why is he workin hand in
glove with the mate o this ship after
killin capn canaughan what game
is he up to can ye tell me

  the girl shook her head sudden tears
the opium skip

x

in her eyes mention of her dead father
had conquered her pride

  i-i dont know she answered fal-
tering some time ago he asked for
my hand but my father laughed at him
he is only a filipino you know my
father had business dealings with him
but im sure did not expect him
aboard here he was not invited
desmond chuckled evidently don
gregorio had considered filipinos from
the old standpoint

  inside of five minutes dona juliana
was appreciably thawing beneath the
sun of desmonds cheerful insouciance
with every other word he brought the
flame of resentment to her gray eyes
shattering her traditions and ignoring
her prejudices yet so subtly command-
ing was his humor so completely did he
take things for granted that she could
say nothing to check this impulsive
person was quite beyond her indeed
when osullivan returned desmond
was gently patting dona julianas hand
and he leaped up to help the fiddler
with such an entire lack of confusion
that before the girl could find the proper
rebuke the occasion was gone

  its a jewel of a larder down there
observed osullivan as tins and pack-
ages were opened and the desk cleaned
off to serve as table if it wasnt for

me fiddle now-

  leave me commanded desmond
ftu get the fiddle presently here
miss juliana and he pressed a pack-
age of biscuit into the girls hands
open these while i get the top out o
this meat tin and well be ready
because he evidently expected her
to do it juliana repressed her indigna-
tion and obeyed then sweeping aside
her protests desmond forced her to
eat something

  however desmond was thinking less
of juliana than of arevalo whom he
rightly estimated as a hard nut to crack
he found that the mans presence and

activities were as much of a mystery
to juliana as to himself

  it appears that hes done for the
skipper observed desmond feeling
quite himself after the hurried meal
and its certain that he murdered your
father miss juliana with his heathen-
ish fumes there must be some pur-
pose in what hes doing-but whats
the purpose a man of his position
and abilities would not try such a wild
game without reason of course miss
juliana he might be intendin to run

away with you-

  with me she broke forth angrily

oh if i had a weapon-

  well its no insult that hed be
wantin to put the comether on you
theres many a man would want the
same but its hardly reason enough
for all the wild divil has done said
desmond coolly theres something
big back of it what it is i cant guess
but well find out soon enough by the
way the old girl is easin into the sea
the storm is blowing itself out michael
terence me lad run and stick your
black head out o the stem windows
and tell me if theres much overhang
from the quarter-deck like a good
boy

  the stern windows echoed dona
juliana in surprise why theyre
shuttered with iron from outside i
remember my father closed the shutters
early this morning

 good enough and desmond
nodded to the hesitating fiddler run
along with ye me lad and open the
shutters before ye stick that head out-
side

  with a grin the fiddler vanished into
the adjoining cabin dona juliana
gazed at desmond puzzled alarm evi-
dent in her eyes

  please tell me what you mean mr
desmond 

  ive got to go forard to get the
lads fiddle returned desmond confi-
dently ye see he forgot and left it


the opium ship

in the forecastle since i cant go by
way o the hatches ill have to crawl

up over the stern and-

diosf ejaculated the girl staring
at him but that is madness for a

fiddle-

  oh this is a particular fiddle re-
joined desmond with his gay laugh
itd break the poor lads heart yonder
to lose the instrument o torture but
the seas are going down fast and since
were headed into the wind the stem
will be sheltered

  yes but arevalo and the men are
coming down here 

  sure and while theyre here fu
be gettin the fiddle isnt that the
height of logic now

  but-but what will  do if they
come and break in  cried the girl des-
perately

  do nothing miss juliana and let
michael terence do the doing thun-
der o finn if yed seen the beautiful
way he shot the mate it wouldve done
your sweet heart good the pity is
we didnt know all the ins and outs of
this business when we knocked arevalo
on the head that was a mortal bad
error ah theres the minstrel boy
now how goes it 

  grand an fine sir responded
osullivan who had doused the light
of the after cabin before opening the
shuttered stem windows sure
theres no overhang at all to speak of
except maybe a bit that will give ye a

twist or two gettin over at the top-

  desmond rose and pressed out the
glowing end of the cheroot he had
lighted

  then i leave the lady in your hands
michael terence if any one comes to
the door shoot first and talk afterward
--and heaven bless ye if the bullet hits
arevalo

  supposin they break down the
door suggested the fiddler

 then use your own judgment
desmond seized the hand of juliana

and pressed it warmly then started for
the after cabin mind now he flung
over his shoulder use the automatic
ye took from arevalo itll put a bullet
through these narra-wood doors like
paper

  he was gone into the darkness the
gaze of juliana following him in trou-
bled uncertainty

  beside her curtained bed desmond
found the window which osullivan
had opened large catches keeping the
iron shutters from banging the ocean
was a smother of blackness but by the
white lines of foam desmond could see
that there was no danger of the water
flooding into the cabin unless the cable
binding the sea anchor should part
toward the horizon a faint rift of
moonlight was piercing the heavens
and desmond rightly imagined that the
storm was blowing itself out

  after some time he was able to make
out the line of quarter-deck rail above
he gave a grunt oi satisfaction and
thrust himself out upon the window
ledge perching precariously as he
clutched upward his fingers gripped
one of the struts supporting the rail
and with a heave he pulled himself up-
ward a minute afterward he crouched
near the loosely lashed wheel

  he saw immediately that the deck
was deserted hereabouts and he started
forward only to come to a pause as a
thin pencil of light stabbed the darkness
ahead it was the galley door opening
a few inches to the roll of the ship
again it opened more widely and des-
mond had a glimpse of arevalo stand-
ing inside talking with the manchu
cook then arevalo came out and
sent a shout forward which was an-
swered by the bellow of balderson

  barely in time desmond flung him-
self prostrate beside the deck house
as the men came aft it was evident
that he had chosen his time well for
the attempt since arevalo and the six
men halted at the battened hatch of
the opium ship



the after companionway and began to
strip off the battens the yellow cook
had joined the others

  not a drop o water over the bow
this half hour said the ponderous
voice of balderson when we get
this done we can drop the port watch
below huh ill keep the deck until

midnight mr arevalo- and the

wind blew the rest away in a sudden
gust

  desmond did not wait to hear more
but edged forward until confident that
he would not be seen then leaped to
his feet and ran for the forecastle
hatchway in another moment he was
bending over the tarpaulin his unac-
customed hands working at the cleats
battens and wedges it was a small
hatch and when he had the tarp re-
moved he had no difficulty in lifting
and throwing over the cover

  pausing only to make sure that he
had not been observed and followed
desmond started down into the black
hole a lurch of the ship threw him
from the ladder and he fell cursing
upon a soft heap that squirmed beneath
him but made no sound as he struck

  startled beyond words by this unex-
pected encounter knowing that a man
lay there beside him desmond reached
out with throttling grip-only to realize
that the man was bound and gagged
he fumbled in his pocket and found a
match

  thunder o finn he muttered
twirling out the flame as he recognized
the figure canaughan upon me
word and i thought that murdering
divil had killed ye here let me ease
your fat mouth o that gag skipper and
mind ye dont bite my fingers

  after an instant a torrent of sus-
tained but husky blasphemy apprised
him that the skipper had been rid of
the gag

  listen now exclaimed desmond
quickly no noise or were both of
us trapped here juliana is safe al-

though arevalo murdered the don in
some stinkin fashion and we thought
hed done for you too

  lef loose my hands an feet
rasped the hoarse skipper strainingly

  not yet me bucko and desmond
grinned in the darkness tve a fw

things to say-

  ye confounded ass came the re-
tort do you know weve been drift-
ing out into the china sea that the

engines are bruk that-

  i know that your friend arevalo is
up to some diviltry said desmond
reaching into the corner bunk and
securing osullivans fiddle case
what is it dye know

  no but if you dont cut me loose
ye blasted and bedamned papist 

knock your-

   youll stay right here eh exactly
now skipper dear let me impress upon
your blighted brains that were in one
hell of a tight place from what weve
learned arevalo and your gentlemanly
mate were in partnership and now ar-
evalo is in command o things but
im in command o the two after cabins
with all the cabin stores and a lot o
bottled spring water and were quite
comfortable thank you

  stop your cursing and listen ye
righteous belfast bloater if i leave
ye here mr arevalo means to finish
you off proper and unless ye promise
to show the light o reason ill leave
ye here i dont want an obstreperous
fool like you spoilin me plans this
situation demands delicacy and brains
neither of which you own i dont like
you and you dont like me but if ye
pass your word to take orders froiti me
ill cut ye loose

  ill see ye damned first hoarsely
returned the skipper

  then good night to ye and pleasant
dreams said desmond starting for the
ladder ill have the ship in charge
by to-morrow night but im afraid yell
not benefit by it poor soul


the opium ship

  hold on muttered the skipper
hastily cant ye see that ill agree

  and no trouble from ye until we
set foot ashore

 not a bit-but ill wipe your
damned face off the map when we do

  itll give me pleasure to recipro-
cate said desmond returning ill
take me knife to these lines-heavens
but theyve lashed ye tight i dont
see why they were so afraid of you
when a native and a bunch of island
scum could knock ye off your own
quarter-deck

  the skipper uttered furious but in-
articulate oaths and staggered to his
feet

 give me your arm when we get
up he said at last its a bad crack
over the skull i got where are the
devils 

  desmond explained the situation
despite his weak and battered body
canaughan was all for descending the
after companion and catching arevalos
gang in the rear but this desmond re-
fused to countenance

  it does ye credit he observed with
a mild sarcasm that infuriated ca-
naughan anew but twill not do skip-
per dear im none too good on my
pins nor are you at present besides
why not let arevalo have the ship a
while and see what hes up to let
him have her let him work out his
guts savin her and when fine weather
comes well take her from him like
that

  ye seem mighty confident returned
the other

  i was never knocked in the head
by me own men said desmond chuck-
mg

  the skipper said something under his
breath and added lets go then
in a tone of suppressed emotion

  as the two men gained the deck they
heard the muffled report of a shot come
from aft followed by a chorus of yells
then silence

 more lively now commanded
desmond sharply well have the
divils own time goin back the way i
came wherell i find a bit o loose
line

  canaughan indicated a line and des-
mond seized the coil in passing

  at the after companion they heard
a rumble of voices from below but did
not pause as desmond had thought
it proved no easy task to regain the
stem window from the deck the line
was passed over the stem rail and des-
mond swung himself down first aided
by the swing of the ship he managed
to hook a foot inside the window and
then let the line swing out until ca-
naughan had followed him when he
pulled in the skipper

  all serene said desmond landing
canaughan softly you pull the line
after you so theyll not be guessing
how you got away and where

  he hastened into the lighted cabin
where he found osullivan standing
automatic in hand juliana was still
sitting as he had left her staring at
the door whose shattered panel bore
witness to the fiddlers shot

 whats doing demanded des-
mond heres your fiddle and the
skippers coming

  glory be exclaimed the fiddler
theyve gone sir

 gone youre sure

  aye we heard em say something
about waiting until the chang yan
showed up when everything would be
all right

  what the divil

  a cry of relief broke from juliana
as the sturdy skipper appeared and
shook hands canaughan however
could throw no light upon the mystery
of the chang yan he had never heard
of any such craft he vowed

  well let be said desmond so
long as theyve gone we can recuperate
in peace to-morrow ill set me brains
to work and well consider the matter
the opium ship



o taking over the ship did ye get
arevalo michael terence 

  i did not sir rejoined the fiddler
mournfully i got somebody but not
him mores the pity 

  better luck next time then and
desmond took a cheroot skipper
will ye have a bite of supper then
michael terence will play us a tune
maybe and well have a drink to our
good luck and go to sleep theres
but two bunks for the three of us but
well manage

  arevalo has something up his
sleeve said the skipper dourly and
were not headin south at all but drivin
west everybodys gone mad im
thinking whats it all mean

  cheer up im perfectly sane and
desmond laughed and mind skip-
per that youve passed your word to
be a righteous man

  canaughan gave him an eloquent
look and rubbed his cracked sconce

  wait till we get ashore thats all
he said grimly just wait

 to be continued

with the stealthy step of a cat
beddows came up the wide
avenue of clipped hollies his
feet making as much sound on the
smooth turf as the wind among its
minute grass stems once in the splash
of shadow dung by the gables and chim-
neys he halted sending a strained gaze
backward in search of a possible pur-
suer

  but he saw only the gray-green sea
of moonlight on the grass which was
already just touched by the hoarfrost
and the tapering spire of the scotch
fir at the end of the avenue with its
flattened crown of leaves its needles
set aslant right up under the proces-
sional clouds

  half a dozen more yards brought
him to as many steps neatly cut in a
slope which extended this side of the
house the double glass doors of a
french window were at the top of the
steps for five minutes he was busy
with a diamond cutter and a treacle
pad he put a hand through the orifice

thus formed and cautiously drew aside
one of the chenille curtains

  he saw first a round table with claw
feet a table of black oak so polished
that the three lighted candle holders
upon it cast points of light as if into
a dark pool there was also an open
book upon this table and a cut-glass
tumbler and a decanter with a long
neck and a box of cigarettes beside
it was a capacious armchair with cush-
ions in the seat angles a wood fire
chuckled and spluttered sociably the
interior of the room was altogether
very cozy and inviting and beddows
did not hesitate to enter

  he looked round with the penetrat-
ing the all-embracing eyes of the
cracksman of experience it was a
no uncertain expression which made
taut every line in his face known to
his associates as the killer he looked
the part that fatal role as he glided
forward with his tread of a panther

  just what he wanted was in a cabinet
in a comer he knew perfectly well
the tenth crisis



that it was in there for he was no
chance no snatch thief when a little
jade clock on the mantelpiece chimed
the half hour after midnight he darted
a yellow flash of his eyes at the in-
terrupter then went straight on he
reached the cabinet three minutes
were between him and attainment

  suddenly a calm voice demanded
what the devil is your little game

  beddows spun round as if touched
by a hot iron a man was standing
by the table a man in evening dress
he was brave this fellow for he kept
his hands in his trousers pockets and
his frown showed only keen exaspera-
tion beddows realized this in the mo-
ment allowed him a leap and his fin-
gers were round one of the brass can-
dlesticks the other recoiled hastily
collided with the armchair and lost his
balance beddows struck home with
his heavy weapon struck with the most
brutal force the man fell across the
arms of the chair as if a rifle bullet
had put out his life

  beddows glared down at the inert
form the candle holder clutched in his
hand as if for a second blow his un-
der jaw stuck out menacingly a phos-
phor light played over his eyes he
breathed stertorously he recovered
himself quickly forced his iron nerve
to hold good deliberately he relighted
the candle in the holder and replaced
it on the table he poured out some
of the brandy in the decanter and
tossed it off

  he leaned over the still figure which
had been struck on the back of the
head he lifted it and seated it in the
chair propping it naturally with the
cushions he felt the heart put his
cheek to the lips

 all right ran his desperate
thought hell come round in an
hour

  then he straightened himself and
was already looking again toward the
cabinet when he fancied he heard a

slight sound six steps would have
taken him to the glass doors four to
the open door by which had entered
the spoiler of his sport the occasion
seemed urgent and beddows chose the
four steps

  he was in a large square-shaped hall
with thick rugs on its waxed floor he
glided to the side of a deep-embrasured
window semidark and waited for de-
velopments he had practically closed
the door of the room he had just
quitted shutting out the light but a pale
drift of moon sheen poured through
the leaded panes of the window
which gave a view of the holly avenue
by which beddows had approached
his quick-roaming eyes showed him
three doors in this hall one he had
just made use of another obviously
led to the outside night and the third
to another room on his left opposite
the window was a broad very shallow
staircase the hall was cozily fur-
nished with settees and lounge chairs
with colored prints and etchings on its
walls

  the intruder took instantaneous note
of these details while he considered his
way of escape in case of a second in-
terruption he had not long to wait

  a creaking stair drew his heated
gaze across the hall a girl was com-
ing down the oaken uncarpeted stair-
case she paused to lean over the ban-
ister to look intently at the door of
the room which beddows had so hast-
ily left she had unloosened her hair
so that her posture brought her long
tresses black as the ravens wing either
side of her face which perhaps because
it was framed in that ebon cloud
seemed deathly pale

  beddows flattened himself against the
wall cursing his continued run of ill
luck at the same time he was held
by the movements of the woman on
the stairs who took each step with in-
finite caution and kept stopping to look
over the handrail at the door below


the tenth crisis

which alone seemed to have gripped her
attention or aroused her suspicions

  as she descended beddows saw her
eyes shine heard her quick nervous
breathing clearly she had been dis-
turbed by the sound of the scuffle and
he wondered why she came alone to
probe the cause of it

  he congratulated himself on having
placed the unconscious man in a natural
position in the armchair he reflected
she will go in there and while she
is trying to rouse the fellow i can
get out by this window or the door

but it is the devils worst luck for

     i
me

  the woman reached the bottom of
the winding staircase her eyes never
for a fraction of a moment leaving the
door of the room beddows saw that
she was dark as night and strikingly
handsome she had loosened her dress
of pale-green silk and he saw the
shapely throat agitated as if by an in-
cessant swallowing movement she
was very much afraid

  and she has need to be ran the
mans desperate thought if she sets
those staring eyes on me ill have to
strangle a scream before she makes it

  the big dose of neat brandy he had
poured down his throat had climbed
to his head and he crouched in the deep
shadow like a wild beast

  the woman commenced to cross the
hall as if its boards were some mine of
death she put up her hands on which
gleamed many jewels and pushed back
the wealth of her black hair beddows
noticed the flash from her fingers and
it inclined him to think twice before
making his escape she carried a for-
tune likely enough upon her delicate
hands and he did not see why he should
let it slip him for half a minute he
meditated a sudden leap forward but
before he could quite make up his mind
the other had reached the door of the
inner room she pushed it inward
slighuy

  she called out in little more than a
whisper in a whisper of heart-stopping
fear are you there edmund

  receiving no answer she pushed the
door open farther and went in

 beddows stepped out from the
shadow in nine crises out of ten he
could make up his mind in a flash of
time but this was the tenth he had
never been placed in a situation similar
also the brandy did not assist lightning
decision at any moment the woman
in there would discover that a crime
had been committed and rush out with
a shriek should he bolt for it 
should he wait should he dart in
after her and silence her

  as these questions flamed through
his uncertain and somewhat clouded
brain the woman reappeared her lips
were parted with terror her eyes di-
lated with horror beddows advanced
in a rush but suddenly he pulled him-
self up with a jerk he had seen some-
thing gleam in the others clenched
right hand it might be a pistol it
might be a steel blade he was not quite
sure but it checked him for an instant
and before that instant passed the
woman had seen him as he stood in
the broad shaft of moonlight and she
put her hand down by her side so that
her dress partly covered and concealed
it

  the action was involuntary the ab-
rupt apparition of the man before her
imparted such a palsying shock that her
wits were numbed she fought for
breath the inward bizarre light of
fear blazed in her dilated pipils death
seemed in her cheeks and lips a pulse
in her beautiful throat beat wildly and
her disengaged hand pressed upon her
heart as if to relieve an agony there
beddows caught the wrist in a strong
grasp he perceived at once that this
extreme of terror made him sure mas-
ter of the situation

  best keep quiet he said menac-
ingly i wont hurt you not unless
the tenth crisis



you start screaming and then hi be
as rough as i know how-

  what are you doing here  she
panted

  thats silly talk im not here on
a week-end invite now what have you
got in that other hand  put it down
i wont stand any fooling

  she broke away from him suddenly
putting her right hand behind her

  give it to me my beauty insisted
beddows hoarsely

  the flare in her starting eyes had
died down a little a little was she now
mistress of herself

  take what you want she replied
breathlessly and go i will not stop
you

 beddows considered violence
would probably frustrate his aim he
resolved to work without it but to
watch her with the utmost vigilance
he moved to close the door of the room
which she had just left

  ah not there she exclaimed
wildly and for the first time he noticed
that she spoke with a strong foreign
accent

  beddows closed the door he was
abruptly puzzled by that entreaty
what did she mean  his first conclu-
sion was that she believed the inmate
of the room to be slumbering in the
easy-chair and that she wished to pro-
tect him but he was forced to let go
of that explanation remembering her
excess of terror when she had emerged
a minute ago it was rather baffling
but clearly she did not suspect him of
the assault and he let it go at that for
the moment

  while he was closing the door she
had drawn the rings from her fingers
she put them-a tiny glittering pile-
upon the back of a settee

  will that satisfy you she asked
shrinking back at his appproach if
so take them and leave here at once
-immediately-before you are pre-
vented

  beddows picked up the jewels
weighing them in his palm he
scarcely looked at them all his attention
focused on the woman she mystified
almost troubled him it was certainly
natural that she should want him away
but eagerness more than anxiety ap-
peared to prompt her beseeching and
although he had not threatened vio-
lence yet her agitation was increasing
to a point which suggested collapse
never had he seen a face so altogether
bloodless and eyes which held a night-
mare of terror

  regarding her with a fierce and
puzzled frown he put the jewels back
on the settee as if they hinted at some
trap he growled we will see about
that suppose we get this door open
first 

  it was the one leading to the holly
avenue he turned a key and drew
a bolt the inrush of chill air felt
good and gave him back his determina-
tion to get what he had come for

  no i want more than that said
he grimly theres a cabinet in that
room and in it theres a box of unset
stones

  she shook her head wildly no
no she forced her dry lips to an-
swer

  i say there is will you fetch it
youll have to im not fool enough
to trust you here alone get it i say

  suddenly an expression which he
could not translate passed over the
others face driving from it the former
paralysis of fear

  ah yes she exclaimed in a low
voice you are perfectly right there
are some unset jewels in the cabinet
i had forgotten stay where you are
and i will bring them to you and
she darted swiftly into the room which
she had entered a few minutes ago in
such an agony of trepidation

  hell seize me if there isnt a depth
here i cant swim in said beddows


the tenth crisis

  the woman was back before fifteen
seconds had passed she pulled to the
door of the room with infinite care as
if fearing to arouse the inmate from
his unnatural slumber

  here they are she panted her eyes
shining with a strange light now
go-go r

  beddows dropped the little silver
casket into his pocket then his right
hand gripped the others shoulder with
a crushing a cruel force

  theres something that beats me in
this he snarled something i am
going to understand  and he com-
menced to force the other back toward
the room he had little or no intention
to enter it but he was determined to
make her speak by god he went
on as she struggled under his mastery
i dont believe you are afraid of me

at all out with it what-

  stop she exclaimed at the critical

moment there-there- she

could say no more

  go on f out with it quick

  in that room-a man-hes dead
beddows released her abruptly
how do you know that he mocked
who told you he is dead
i-i killed him

  you

  i killed him she moaned catching
at a chair for support

  he stared at her as if he believed she
had taken leave of her senses a long
tense silence ensued she kept pressing
her heart as if she was suffocating and
suddenly beddows caught another
glimpse of something which gleamed in
the clutch of her left hand something
which she tried to conceal which she
refused to abandon

  at the same instant a clew to the
mystery flashed through his amazement
caused by her wrords it was a steel
blade gripped so jealously in her palm
she had descended the staircase not
because she had heard a disturbance
but with intent to go into that room

and commit a crime and she had
gone in she had found its inmate in
an easy-chair and she had concluded

he was sleeping and so-and so-

  you stabbed him exclaimed bed-
dows aloud concluding his thought

  she did not answer she could not
answer her bosom rose and fell in
a tumult

  you little devil you he went on
what did you do it for

  she panted in her terrible struggle
for breath i was mad

  he jeered that is to say you are
sorry

  ah god knows i am i killed him
because i-i loved him

  and he loved some one else you
cursed little italian spitfire

  at that moment there was a slight
noise which seemed to come from in-
side the room but it was not noticed
beddows continued in the same jeer-
ing tone

  i thought you were scared of me
but the boots on the other foot now
whod have thought it to look at you
a nice hell of jealousy youve been
stewing in and now youll have to
pay for it

  in a mute agony she regarded him
as if she did not comprehend the brutal
banter fear and remorse imparting an
expression almost of insanity in her
staring motionless eyes

  of course i see through your move
now beddows went on wiping his hot
forehead which the heat of the room
and the half glass of brandy had dewed
with perspiration i understand why
you were suddenly glad for me to go
off with the box out of the cabinet in
that room it occurrs to you that i
might then be wanted for the business
in there pretty i must say i thought
i was cute but i cant hold a candle
to the sense in those delicate brains
of yours what was it you used  some
fancy weapon you can show it to me
now you know
the tenth crisis



  she extended her left arm jerkily
inside her palm was a tiny cut-glass
vial she moaned

  i had left it in his room i came
downstairs for it

  beddows brows came together in a
bewildered stare

  curse me if i follow even now
he muttered

  she panted trembling fingers claw-
ing at her cheek merciful god how
could i do it  it was in this bottle-
that which killed him i emptied it
every drop of it into the decanter of
brandy 

  what roared beddows in a fright-
ened voice

  that thunderous shout had not died
upon his blanching lips when there
came the sound of a heavy dragging

footstep in the inner room uncertain
fingers fumbled at the handle the door
was jerked back and the inmate ap-
peared swaying unsteadily he saw
nothing heard nothing for he was still
stupefied by the blow from the brass
candlestick the woman uttered a
shrill heart-piercing cry she rushed at
him with extended arms

  beddows made for the door opening
upon the holly avenue he missed it
as if he could not see found it at a
second attempt ran out into the night
he went down the glade like a mad-
man throwing distorted shadows upon
the frost rime

  and suddenly the broad moon and
the lamps of the stars and the proces-
sion of clouds swung round and round
like a whirlpool with the seethe and
roar of an immense whirlpool

  the dance

           by charles kiproy

 a hi let this music never cease

      the throbbing viol and the flute
 do we not dance together now

 let other thoughts be mute

 drain every cup of glistening wine
 and let our laughter fill the halls   
 the shadows of the spluttering candles
 sink against the walls

 outside the quiet stars look down
 upon a world that waits the dawn
 within the dancers wheel and spin
 still dancing on and on
chapter i

the spink of cracked glass fol-
lowed by the vicious spat of
metal striking wood came with-
out warning an infinitesimal fraction
of time before these tragic sounds
broke the stillness the man at barney
donovans desk inclined his head to
look for a slip of paper which had
strayed far back beneath the hood
otherwise the bit of death-dealing lead
would not have struck the wall

  as official assayer for the molta min-
ing company barney donovan usually
busied himself at that desk at that hour
of the evening to-night he was in
town and bart carson the mine super-
intendent was searching through the
contents while waiting donovans re-
turn

  had those sounds startled the ears
of a man less wary than carson he
might have glanced up in surprise but
to him that ominous signal smacked
of older bolder days-a forerunner of
serious trouble keeping his face close

to the desk top he snapped off the
light then jerking an automatic from
a drawer he tiptoed to the window
through which the bullet had entered

  when his eyes became accustomed
to the darkness he made out a jagged
hole in one of the lower panes the
window faced south one hundred
yards away and that many feet lower
than the office flowed littlesnake
creek although there was no moon
the clear night rendered objects distin-
guishable for quite a distance yet an
intent study of the creek-bottom shad-
ows failed to reveal anything unusual

 the front door faced east he
moved stealthily to his left and opened
it without crossing the threshold he
listened for telltale sounds all he heard
was the croaking of frogs in a pool
west of the office and the faint rumble
of stamps at the mill a quarter of a
mile up the canon

  he closed the door and turned to
the middle one of three doors which
pierced the inner wall on his right
vanishing gold

i

was the assayers bedroom on his left
was the laboratory and furnace room
he opened the middle door behind
which was a closet containing the assay
safe not two hours earlier both he
and barney had weighed checked and
stored one hundred thousand dollars
worth of gold bars in that safe he
groped for the bolt lever and tested it
it resisted his effort and he was satis-
fied

  he retraced his steps to the front
door out on the tiny front porch he
paused some one who used a strong
pipe had just been at that spot or was
lurking very close the odor was such
as an inveterate pipe smoker would
have about his clothing

 a lantern bobbed up and down a
short distance up the path as the night
watchman approached from the mill
carson did not wait instead he faced
north and passed around the building
halting at each corner alert distrust-
ful before he had completed the
round he heard the watchman stamp
across the porch the next moment
the brilliant glow of an incandescent
lamp supplanted the lanterns puny
glimmer within the office

  the watchman filled and lighted a
service-blackened corncob pipe then
settled back in the assayers chair with
an air of comfort carson eyed him
speculatively through the broken win-
dow

  tall loose-jointed sour of face and
disposition with mottled gray eyes al-
most as deadly as his gnarled trigger
finger cyanide bill sutter was of
that type of taciturn guardians who
shoot first and talk at the inquest

  a grim set look crept into carsons
face as he saw the watchman stare
around the office in an attitude of lis-
tening he began to wonder if sutter
had heard the shot if so the crafty
grin on his seamed features betrayed
anything else than official concern

  carson pondered the situation un-

accountable accidents of which the
mysterious shot was the most recent
had been occurring with strange fre-
quency of late one thing only pre-
vented him from attributing the shot
to an enemy bent upon revenge-the
assay safe contained the largest ship-
ment of gold bullion on record for the
molta company and it was due out
on the morning stage

  and yet all angles considered re-
venge presented the most likely reason
for the mine crews had no love for
their superintendent just why was
an unanswered question though many
surmised that he lacked personality-
that indefinable quality which is essen-
tial in men of authority

  his latest clash had beeen with bar-
ney donovan that morning only for
the opportune appearance of emily
carson his daughter the quarrel would
have ended in blows

  barney who was twenty-six had
boarded with carson and his daughter
for more than a year and no good-
looking well-bred young man can daily
associate with a lady of lesser years
whose admirable qualities include
beauty charm and cooking and not
escape the inevitable results

  secretly carson did not approve of
the match but he never expressed his
opinion openly until barney pointed out
some dubious features in the semian-
nual mine report then carson had
flown into a towering rage he was
even unwise enough to drag the inti-
mate friendship of barney and emily
into the quarrel when barney bested
him in the original argument

  stay clear of my house and dont
let me catch you near my daughter from
this time on carson had yelled

  easy-going barney held his temper
and tried cajolery carson on the con-
trary became more angry and began
to hurl abusive epithets beyond human
endurance

  if its the last thing i ever do 


vanishing gold

make you regret those words before i
leave here declared barney thor-
oughly aroused

  no you wont you leave at once
shouted carson just as his daughter
entered the assay office

  later after a stormy session between
emily and her father the latter made
a peace offering by retracting his last
words barney rather sullenly agreed
to stay but announced that especial
business would take him to molta after
supper

  as the incident revived itself in car-
sons thoughts two questions disturbed
him was barney responsible for the
shot or was the shot intended for bar-
ney the latter conjecture was highly
improbable in fact the open prefer-
ence which a majority of the miners
held for the young assayer was one
cause of carsons wrathful outburst

  retrospectively carson turned back
to a time five years previous when no
man had stood higher than himself in
the esteem of his fellow miners that
was before the big slide when he was
merely shift boss afterward puzzling
changes had been instituted

  buffalo hogan the former super-
intendent bought out molta citys
largest saloon and gambling hall car-
son succeeded him as mine superin-
tendent while pap krause sole sur-
vivor of the slide victims became a
childish vacant-minded recluse living
in one of the company cabins but
secretly supported by carson

  hypothetical reasons for this were
legion and like natures eternal lava
pots slumbered for indefinite intervals
only to burst with fresh upheavals of
gossip whenever carson had trouble
with his crews

  the general feeling found open ex-
pression through bud hardy veteran
mine foreman on the night shift bud
resented and ignored carsons orders
repeatedly the latters patience re-
mained in check until an accident oc-

curred seemingly as a result of the dis-
obedience then bud was discharged
without ceremony

  in leaving the irate foreman shook
his fist in carsons face shouting
you fire me for this stingy little
breakdown but you forget you were
made super after youd buried a dozen
good men and ducked to save your yel-
low hide

  from that moment matters had taken
a decided turn for the worse hardy
was popular both in town and at the
mine and his friends began to show
their resentment in countless furtive
ways-rocks falling from unthought-of
places timbers dropping without cause
or warning deadly live wires dangling
in unlighted levels through which car-
son sometimes passed lastly a shot at
his back

  suddenly carson stiffened his mind
recalled to the present by sutters ac-
tions a dozen rapid strides took him
to the porch and into the office where
he found the closet door open and sut-
ter squatting in front of the safe

  the watchman rose to his feet meet-
ing carsons glare without an outward
sign of uneasiness

  is there anything about that safe
particularly interesting to you cya-
nide demanded carson

  bart yo words is tame drawled
sutter after a pause but the way yuh
says em is pizen if yo conscience aint
a painin yuh none why get riled f i
look tub see if any mice has gnawed
a hole in the safe

  the comers of carsons mouth whit-
ened perceptibly a strange light flick-
ered in his eyes cyanide calmly
closed the middle door picked up his
lantern and started to leave

  did you hear a shot about thirty
minutes ago asked carson in an off-
hand tone

 shot whar

  carson was positive cyanides eyes
darted to the broken window
vanishing gold



  cant say just where i thought i
heard one myself that is all he replied

  cyanide grunted and walked out

  carson tried the safe door once
more then examined the wall back of
barneys desk his investigation led
him into the laboratory where he found
the bullet lodged in the ceiling its
course indicating that it had been fired
from the creek bottom

  by means of a chair and a table he
was able to reach and extract the bullet
which was not so badly mutilated that
its size could not be determined his
must ached lip exposed his teeth in an
expression of cruel joy the leaden mis-
sile was a  and barney donovan
possessed the only gun of that caliber
in molta

  he would have made an immediate
search of barneys room had not the
clop-clop of galloping hoofs reached his
ears he seated himself at the desk
and waited with deadly patience

  barney entered a few minutes later
his ill humor had vanished in its stead
lurked a sheepish look the expression
of a man who though ashamed of some
unmanly act is uncertain as to the re-
ception of his apology carson mis-
construing the look eyed him narrowly

  did you think id dug out alto-
gether greeted barney dumping an
armload of bundles on the desk it
took me longer than i expected heres
one letter for you and a note some
fellow stopped me when i was leaving
and asked me to hand it to you

  carson accepted the missives in si-
lence he read the note first then
cramming it in his pocket he opened
the letter barney busy at putting
away his purchases heard carson
curse in a venomous fashion

  bad news he asked good-na-
turedly inquisitive

  carson glowered barney took the
hint and passed into his bedroom

  barney ship the bullion for me in
the morning shipping memos all

  atb

ready in the middle drawer fm tak-
ing the midnight train for frisco it
seems that everybody is out to get me
so im going to do some getting of my
own rasping this combined order
and threat at the astonished barney
carson yanked the outer door open and
vanished into the darkness

chapter ii

ichoes of the morning whistle
flung back from massed ranks of
pine-studded dawn-lit hills had hardly
ceased reverberating when the mail
stage honked into camp

  barney rubbing the second nap from
his eyes scuffed into the office to greet
the express guards a cross-fire of
hilarious bantering ensued after which
barney produced the shipping book and
disappeared in the closet

  sutter entered in the meantime and
began to converse with the messengers
cyanide seldom came near mine or
offices when off watch but the unusual-
ness of his present visit was not re-
marked

  within the closet there were sounds
of matches being struck of objects
moved hastily about those outside
heard barney swear

   smatter barney-peeved  called
one messenger

  sutters eyes glittered

barney catapulted from the closet

  and who wouldnt be peeved  the
safe is cleaned he cried

  two pairs of eyes bulged in amaze-
ment sutters face remained expres-
sionless the messengers crowded
forward to view the empty safe

been tampered with queried one

  not sos you can see it the com-
bination worked o k replied bar-
ney

  aw some fellow cracked it while
you was pounding your ear declared
the other messenger

impossible the safes hooked up


vanishing gold

to a burglar alarm that would wake
a dead man and i cut it in just be-
fore i went to bed bart stayed here
while i was in town and cyanide
punches the porch clock every hour
exclaimed barney

  did you notice anything wrong last
night cyanide he asked turning to
the watchman

  nary a wrong i wuz up here twict
an hour an didnt see a soul but yuh
an bart drawled sutter

  maybe the thief came at it from be-
low suggested the first messenger

  no chance that closet has a con-
crete floor two feet thick explained
barney you can see for yourselves
there isnt a crack in it

  thats a fact sure enough agreed
the other adding well i guess your
box is a dead one this trip so well
ramble its tough luck and no fool-
ing so long

  after the stage disappeared in a
cloud of dust barney spent twenty min-
utes in researching the safe closet and
examining the exterior of the cabin
sutter moved in and out apparently
engaged in an investigation of his own

  barney finally stepped to the tele-
phone first notifying the company
headquarters then passing word to the
local sheriff to come out at once

  may the saints protect us when the
old man gets the news he breathed
as he hung up

  barney had reference to isaiah mid-
dleman president of the molta com-
pany and sutter who had been listen-
ing started to say something

  hoo-hoo bar-nee hailed a voice
from without

  barney made a quick gesture for si-
lence hurrying outside as he did so
an animated pinto pranced from side
to side in front of the steps seated in
the saddle and swaying to the pintos
movements was one whose voice would
have drawn barney over trackless sea
and desert in faithful obedience

though no one realized it except bar-
ney he might have been holding a job
at a thousand more per year but for
emily carsons expressive hazel eyes

  good morning emmy he greeted
her permitting the pinto to nose at his
pockets

  say barney fve a good scolding
stored up for you here ive waited
breakfast a whole hour and you didnt
come just to punish you im going
to make you wait till ive given goo-

goo his morning run hell- the

pinto reared in thrilling circus fashion
of all the lovingest crazy animals
ill be gone-a few minutes

  the last words waited back to bar-
ney from a confused blur of flying
heels waving tail billowing dust
pfwhere be the boss

  the brogue-tinged question brought
barneys mind back to earth he turned
to see scanlon the mine foreman on
the porch behind him sutter had gone

  barts gone to frisco scanlon
anything i can do for you

  oi were wonderin if the boss hired
annybody to take windy tuttles place
on the lower stope

  whats wrong with tuttle

  the boss fired him yisterday only
half his crew rayported this mornin
an they be drrunker than a brewry
cat oi were dommed glad for to see
that human air compressor go but we
be gettin the best ore from the lower
stope an yez cant afford to leave it
idle

  when deeply perplexed barney al-
ways poked a pencil through his hair
hair that was curly and blond though
some might have dared to call it red
he manipulated his pencil for fully two
minutes then stepped to the telephone
an afterthought caused him to turn
back without taking the receiver down

  take a crew from some other level
scanlon and get along till bart comes
back use your own judgment itl
stand responsible for the order
vanishing gold



  scanlon accepted barneys sugges-
tion with a look of relief and hastened
back to the shaft house barney seated
himself on the porch and for a time
was lost in troubled thought later
he procured a flash lamp from his room
and spent nearly half an hour reexam-
ining the safe and the closet the
sheriffs car arrived while he was still
in the closet but he failed to hear it
more puzzled than ever he slid back
into the office on his knees and mopped
the sweat from his face

  i wonder if im spoofy or am i just
somebodys goat ill- his solil-
oquy ended as he sighted the sheriff
who stood in the doorway

  why hello hemmerson he called
to him ashamed because he had been
caught talking to himself

  how-dee donovan responded the
sheriff what appears to be the trou-
ble

  well hemmerson its what has dis-
appeared that is responsible for my

present trouble- barney paused

  hit the house pretty hard eh i
met the stage down the line they told
me it was a hundred thousand

  yes the stage was waiting to take
it down when i discovered the loss
wheres carson

  on his way to frisco

  are you sure of that

  barney rose and regarded the sheriff
in surprise

  i know that he told me he was go-
ing down on the midnight train i can
ask the night operator he replied ad-
vancing to the phone

  hemmerson voiced no objection but
showed deep interest in the one-sided
conversation which followed barney
fell to penciling his hair when he hung
up

  the night operator says windy
tuttle was the only passenger going
south at midnight he announced in a
troubled voice

  hemmerson stared at the broken

window for a moment then asked
have you any idea why bart went to
frisco

  barney shook his head

  did anything happen before he
left

  barney reluctantly told of what had
taken place the previous day and eve-
ning before he finished the auto stage
from molta arrived its lone passen-
ger a hulking dark-featured man
came toward the assay office as he
stepped upon the porch barney and
hemmerson favored him with inquir-
ing glances

  i want to see carson announced
the stranger

  carson is out of town is your
business urgent barneys reply was
civil though he mentally declared the
man to be a compatible teammate for
cyanide bill

  yes-im knucker the new super-
intendent ive orders from middle-
man to take charge at once

  barney was surprised into silence
in the sensitive balance of his minds
scales he weighed the stranger at the
same time sifting the news that spelled
carsons discharge

  carsons in san francisco he wont
be back for a day or two at least he
vouchsafed the scales had caught
their balance carson swung the lower
beam knucker dangled high at the op-
posite end

  any fit place to stop around here
demanded knucker

  you will find the boarding house
open

  without seeming to notice barneys
curtness knucker set out in the direc-
tion indicated by barneys pointing fin-
ger as he swaggered up the path the
other two watched him uncompromis-
ingly

  he aint much on gentle looks
commented hemmerson

  not on your flea bite sniffed
barney contemptuously


vanishing gold

  then he frowned

  knucker had halted and was ogling
the splendid picture of horsewoman-
ship as emily and her pinto came
charging down the mill road with a
wave and a smile for barney she cried
as she galloped past come to your
breakfast slow poke

  knucker was not so far away as to
prevent the expressions of his face
from being read by barney far more
than admiration was registered in the
coarse brutal features

  barney watched until emily passed
from sight beyond the cabins he saw
knucker loiter near the carson cabin
an unreasonably long time-even star-
ing back over his shoulder when he
moved on to the boarding house

  how was bart dressed when he left
you  inquired hemmerson anxious to
reopen the interrupted subject

  same old outfit-laced boots mole-
skin trousers brown flannel shirt gray
sombrero you seldom find him dressed
any other way

  was this the note you brought him
last night

  barney recognized the paper which
hemmerson held out its scrawly ad-
dress would have identified it any-
where he nodded a question in his
eyes

  who gave it to you

  im paralyzed if i can tell i was
heading out main street way when a
fellow hollered my name he handed
me the note and told me it was for
bart he hustled away so fast i
couldnt recognize him in the darkness
besides i was in a tearing big hurry
myself anything wrong

  read the note and see suggested
hemmerson

  barney opened the soiled sheet and
read

  all set slip me your tip and we go to it
if you telephone say fools gold

uno

  what do you make of it asked

hemmerson as a pencil point began to
shuttle through barneys hair

  who is-where did you find it

  where the mail stage was held up
on its down trip this morning

chapter iii

darney backed against the wall as
if thrust there by an invisible hand

  what was taken he managed to
ask

  nothing two masked men turned
the trick at the narrows from what
the messengers told me the pair ex-
pected the bullion box and were wilder
than bobcats when they didnt find
it

  the telephone bell interrupted it
proved to be middleman calling from
company headquarters in san fran-
cisco in reply to the presidents re-
quest barney told what carson had
said about going to the city on the
midnight train

  well he didnt get here on it i
made it a point to meet the train de-
clared the irate official

  barney felt an inexplicable tightening
at his throat as he passed this news to
hemmerson the sheriff listened with-
out comment and after inspecting the
safe as well as each means of ingress
to the cabin he hurried back to molta

  shortly after hemmersons depar-
ture emily came down from the cabins
and demanded of barney an explana-
tion of his unprecedented tardiness
he attempted to efface his troubled
look by a wan smile while he made an
equivocal excuse he would have
gone to his long-overdue breakfast had
there been any one about to guard the
office in his absence

  you dont happen to know what
called your father away last night do
you he asked

  nothing more than what he said in
a note which i found on the kitchen
table this morning
vanishing gold



  what did it say

  emily did not answer at once her
eyes were on the broken window

  it said-she nibbled at her lip then
turned her eyes full at him-something
about important business that would
keep him away several days

  do you know how he went per-
sisted barney

  i dont really know but he must
have walked or taken the stage his
horse is in the corral and he didnt
change his clothes so he cannot have
gone far but why catechize me so
have you heard-barney was on
the verge of announcing knuckers ar-
rival but could not bring himself to
utter the words-that theres some dif-
ficulty in the mine that needs his at-
tention he finished lamely

  emilys eyes now wide with just a
glint of horror in them were staring
at the telltale hole above barneys desk
he in turn failed to notice her ex-
pression a far-away look filmed his
eyes as he gazed toward the mill visi-
ble through the open door

  emily stepped to the furnace-room
door and glanced inside when she
withdrew her head barney observed a
baffling look in her face all rich color
had fled from her cheeks

  whats the matter emmy-are you
sick 

  will you loan-me your revolver
barney she asked ignoring his ques-
tion im going to amuse myself at
target practice while papa is away
surest thing you know cried bar-
ney glad of some chance to please her

  he disappeared into his room re-
turning a moment later with a heavy
long-barreled six-shooter and a box of
cartridges

  there you are hope you make a
bulls-eye every shot ill get more
shells when these are gone

  emily accepted the weapon in si-
lence examining it with an air of fa-
miliarity as she moved to the door

  well are you coming to breakfast

or not she asked from the doorway

  no its most too late now make
it two in one at noontime suggested
barney advancing to her side

  he reached for her free hand but
she evaded the move by stepping from
the porch again both were silent

  barney tm disappointed in you
she suddenly flung over her shoulder
then sped away up the path

  barneys hand automatically fished a
pencil from his pocket while he tried
to fit her parting declaration to some-
thing he had or had not done when
he could no longer see her he turned
back to his desk

  at noontime he found her in a more
friendly mood though her enigmatic
questions gave him food for uneasy
thought throughout the afternoon

  the mid-afternoon stage brought the
companys special detectives harper
and simms barney welcomed them in
the mood he imagined he would have
felt in the presence of his own execu-
tioners

  the detectives lost no time in getting
to their task barney answered their
ceaseless questions as best he could
giving them full benefit of his meager
knowledge concerning the robbery it-
self

  after an exhaustive search of the
interior of the cabin the trio proceeded
outside nothing escaped harpers
eyes and barney gave him the infor-
mation he requested by pointing out
different trails and buildings in sight

  directly west of the office they came
to the brink of an arroyo between
rainy seasons this arroyo was dry ex-
cept for a pool of slime-covered water
cut off from littlesnake creek by a
wide gravel bar the west bank was
considerably lower than the spot where
the men were standing beyond the
arroyo a cabin roof was visible amid
chimps of chaparral and scrub oak


vanishing gold

  and who might live there asked
harper pointing

  old pap krause answered bar-
ney

  whats his business

  just existing hes been a keen old
chap in his day but only half baked
now he was in the big slide a few
years back they say it was the com-
panys fault and to square themselves
they deeded him some dead land with
a cabin on it then let it ride at that
is he dangerous

  not at all-harmless as a babe
carsons daughter helps him and he
thinks the world of her but he dont
seem to shine up to her dad much
hes pretty rational as a rule some-
times his mind flops over and he isnt
heard from for days at a stretch
harper releasing his breath in a
long noisy exhalation surveyed the
scene in silence

  the evening whistle boomed its sig-
nal and the three turned back to the
office sutter came down the path as
they entered leaving him to watch the
office barney accompanied the detec-
tives to the boarding house

  after introducing them to the board-
ing boss as mine inspectors he set out
for carsons cabin on the way he
sighted knucker in close conversation
with scanlon and the night mine fore-
man both day and night mill fore-
men were in the group also

  at the supper table emilys quietness
and reserve caused barney to wonder
if she had heard of the robbery yet
he lingered a long time after the sup-
per dishes were cleared away then
gathering his courage he told her of
the morning discovery-all but the
note

  emily pondered a moment before re-
plying her eyes downcast the color
rising and ebbing in her cheeks the
news had not leaked out as yet and
came as a shock to her

  barney are you going to be un-

grateful enough to hint that papa took
that gold especially after youve tried
to injure him-or was murder your in-
tention 

  emilys tone was throaty vibrant
with hurt surprise barney sat up in
his chair with a start

  was murder my intention he
echoed say emmy ill admit that
queer bugs ramble through my intelli-
gence plant occasionally but do you
really call it attempted murder on my
part when i simply obey a law of na-
ture and refuse to let your dad choke
me as he tried-

  i admit that you were justified in
protecting yourself then but there was
no excuse for your sneaking behind his
back and shooting at him like a cow-
ard

  shoot at him-whats the answer
emmy i havent shot at anything for
so long ive forgotten what powder
smells like what makes you-

  emilys gesture was imperious as she
spread a note before barneys eyes

  emily  ill be gone a few days on im-
portant business keep a sharp eye on young
donovan  he tried to get even by shooting
me in the back you can see the bullet hole
over his desk ill attend to him when i get
back	dad

  barney skimmed over the note re-
read it more slowly then looked up
smiling queerly

  hadnt we better let it ride until
he does return he asked

  you dont deny it then

  emilys lips tightened her eyes
flashed

  why should i even attempt to deny
such a far-fetched accusation as that

  for answer emily leaped to her feet
and stepped to a shelf near the door
when she returned to the table she laid
barneys six-shooter in front of him
also an empty cartridge

  im the bummest guesser in the
world emmy smiled barney
whats the answer
vanishing gold



  the answer oh i might have
known youd say that a man who
shoots like a coward is bound to be
too cowardly to own up to his tricks
declared emily passionately the an-
swer is you stood in the creek last
night when papa was good enough to
sit up while you went to town and
when you got a good chance at his back
you tried to kill him the mark of your
bullet is over your desk and in the ceil-
ing of the furnace room you left the
empty shell where you stood then it
seems you were cunning enough to re-
load and have a box of cartridges handy
with only six shells missing and to
think ive trusted you all these months
and treated you as my own brother

and-

  tears began to rise unbidden to the
surface with the last words she paused
to check them

  barney traced an aimless trail
through his hair and inspected the
empty cartridge to discover that it was
a duplicate of those in the weapon
he rolled it back and forth on the
table with two fingers deliberating upon
an answer his decision reached he
prepared to leave

  ive an idea emmy that if we let
this subject rest till weve had a night
sleep we can come to a rational under-
standing keep the evidence you have
explanations wont help me just now
i was-anyway ill see you at break-
fast time

  emily caught her breath to protest
as the door closed behind him then
she gave way to womans greatest
panacea for soul burdens-tears

  the night watchman was in earnest
conversation with harper and simms
when barney entered the assay office
but hurried out at once as if desirous
of avoiding him he would have gone
directly to his room had not the de-
tectives detained him with more ques-
tions as soon as he dared he excused
himself saying im dead tired fel-

lows ill roll in now and see you all

in the morning

  scarcely had he latched the bedroom
door than sounds of an auto approach-
ing at high speed reached him brakes
screeched under the strain of a sud-
den stop some one struck the porch in
a jump bursting unceremoniously into
the office

  wheres donovan  demanded a
deep bass voice

  hello hemmerson whatll you
have greeted barney reopening his
door

just a word with you-in private

  barney startled uneasy beckoned
the sheriff into the bedroom the in-
stant the door closed hemmerson pro-
duced a massive bone-handled six-
shooter

  ever see this gun before 

  barney gulped and nodded

  its-baits he admitted in a half
whisper

  you are sure of that

again barney nodded his lips
shaping themselves to say why

  bud hardy has been murdered
shot in the back i picked this gun up
ten paces from his body

chapter iv

the sheriffs words were distinct

	enough but bamy had to mouth
them parrot fashion in his bewilder-
ment his hand strayed to the pencil
holder

  i was headed home for the night
when i heard the shot explained
hemmerson hardy was at hogans
joint all evening sopping up the ugly
juice and shouting about how wild car-
son was because he hardy had busted
the supers job they say hardy stag-
gered out the back way declaring hed
show bart up still more before he was
done the gun barked two minutes
later when i got to the alley where
it happened hardy was dead i stepped


vanishing gold

on this gun before i reached him see
for yourself one shell is empty the
gun was hot when i picked it up

  maybe somebody else borrowed or
stole the gun interposed barney

  such a thing could happen but how
about this it was clutched in hards
right hand

  hemmerson held out a horsehair
chain a nugget charm and carsons
watch attached to it the watch crys-
tal was gone the hands twisted

  god hemmerson groaned bar-
ney isnt there some chance of prov-
ing that a mistake has been made this

will be- what will become of

emmy 

  hemmerson preoccupied by his own
deductions pulled at his ear lobe with-
out replying at length he pocketed the
gun and watch then left the bedroom

  halting at the outer door he called
back i came near forgetting-found
one of your men down the road a ways
too drunk to walk i gave him a lift
hes out in my machine hello here
he is on the porch 

  barney gazed past hemmerson and
saw windy tuttle swaying drunkenly
in the light of the open door

  one of the devils own you mean
snorted barney adding this man
is responsible for nine-eighths of our
trouble at the mine hes a dirty boot-
legger im betting hes loaded with
booze right now outside and inside
both

  hemmerson seized the inebriate by
the collar and yanked him into the
office searching his pockets thoroughly
a pocket knife some small change a
six-shooter and a quart bottle contain-
ing a small quantity of whisky consti-
tuted windys possessions

  the sheriff evfhced keen interest in
the gun and windy released from the
none too gentle grip slumped gro-
tesquely to the floor barneys face
bore a nauseated look as he watched
the act

  now if this shooting iron was a
 things might perk up for bart
vouchsafed hemmerson although
one of these chambers is empty its a
 hardy was killed with a  be-
sides-he sniffed at the muzzle-this
blunderbuss aint been fired anyways
soon from the smell

  the mention of the weapons caliber
excited barneys instant attention it
was an exact counterpart of the gun
he had loaned emily that morning he
said nothing however but scrutinized
windy with smoldering eyes

  well donovan do what you like
with tuttles exhibits ive got to be
moving back ill see you later an-
nounced hemmerson leaping into his
car

  after the sheriffs departure harper
simms and barney regarded the be-
sotted miner with varied expressions of
disgust barney returned the knife and
change to windys pockets the bottle
of brain disturber he smashed against
the porch steps the gun he carefully
hid in his own room lastly he took
firm hold on windys shoulders drag-
ging him out into the open like a log
of wood he was sorely tempted to
shove his whisky-soaked burden over
into the slime-covered pool instead he
left him lying in a patch of wire grass

  back in his bedroom he turned out
the light and flung himself on the bed
to marshal his thoughts into some sem-
blance of order a mumbling conver-
sation between harper and simms con-
tinued an hour much to his annoyance
then they left some time afterward
maudlin voices passed the assay office
outward bound one hiccuping re-
mark reminded barney of tuttle and
he breathed a profane wish anent
windys eternal future

  at dawn he leaped to his feet sur-
prised to find that he had fallen asleep
without disrobing no one came near
the assay office until long after the
vanishing gold



whistle blew in consequence he was
again late for breakfast

  when he reached the carson cabin
he found emily watering her pinto and
her fathers pony pity wrung his heart
as he noted her red and swollen eye-
lids

  and hows every little thing this
morning  he asked cheerfully

  emily shook her head not daring to
speak unabated tears lurked too close
to the surface

  attributing her silence to her suspi-
cions he tried to frame a question that
lay closest to his heart before he
could utter a word he saw her eyes
widen and stare at some object behind
him turning he discovered knuckers
swarthy face leering at her from the
opposite side of the corral

  instinctive rage banished all other
worries from barneys mind he would
have enjoyed heaving a rock at the
grinning stranger

  who is he whispered emily

  that-contemptuously-is sup-
posed to be your fathers better calls
himself knucker the new superintend-
ent

  without an eyelash quivering emily
gazed full into the newcomers face
knucker bowed and mumbled good
morning but her eyes never wavered

  notwithstanding a natural twinge of
jealousy barney watched with interest
no impertinent masher had yet been
seen around molta who could withstand
emilys scathing stare once convinced
that she was picked as a mashers vic-
tim her hazel eyes became batteries
of withering fire

  but unlike the uncultured roughness
of miners or the flippantly rude ad-
vances of occasional strangers knucker
stood in a class distinctly separate from
all others in his brutish domain sa-
cred right was tabooed purity was
dross

  barney saw emilys cheeks flame-
not the delicate mantling of a blush but

a deep dull-red signal of anger he
dared not trust himself to look at
knucker gently taking the pail from
her hand he urged in a low voice
come into the kitchen ive something
to tell you

  she yielded to the pressure of bar-
neys hand at her elbow and turned
toward the cabin her pinto nickering
his hurt surprise at not receiving a fare-
well pat

  knucker watched the two enter the
kitchen then with an evil chuckle he
set out for the mill office

  while emily prepared breakfast in
silence barney withdrew to a corner
and lifted a snow-white cat from his
favorite chair giving deposed tabby the
benefit of his lap

  for a time he stroked the cat with-
out speaking too blunt to be tactful
too truthful to be secretive he debated
long before taking up the disagreeable
subject he began by telling her the
so-far unofficial information that her
father was superseded by knucker
he fought shy of mentioning the
holdup or the murder yet he realized
that if he did not inform her of those
calamities there were neighbors who
thrived on such morbid gossip

  furtively he watched her move from
stove to table and back then with a
deep sigh gripped his courage for the
plunge

 emmy about how much bad news
can you stand all at once

  a stove lid dropped clattering ring-
ing to the floor white-faced lifter in
hand she whirled to face him

  he could not meet her eyes slowly
stroking the cat he continued what
would you do if they should find in-
disputable evidence against your father
both for murder and robbery

  oh dont sit like a block of wood
and keep me in suspense she man-
aged to scold hysterically

  barney groped for suitable words


vanishing gold

  barney donovan dont you dare put
me off another minute

  emily stamped her foot and nearly
tore her apron as she twisted its cor-
ners in her agitation

  then barney told her of the note
the stage holdup the murder of hardy
the damning evidence which hemmer-
son had secured and which pointed to
carson as the guilty man

  emily seemed to shrivel under the
blow the kitchen clocks ticking
sounded loud above the muffled roar of
stamps tabby purred as if no sorrow
were near digging her foreclaws into
barneys thigh to express her enjoy-
ment the wood fire snapped and
cracked in the semistillness

  with one forefinger pressed against
her teeth a gesture of hers which al-
ways preluded an outburst of anguish
emily sank into a chair suddenly she
cast herself forward upon the table
and burst into a storm of violent sob-
bing

  atremble in sympathy barney
brushed the cat from his lap and
stepped to her side

  oh i begged papa to leave this hate-
ful old mine when mamma died
sobbed emily ive lived in such
dread lately and my dreams have been
terrible papa owes somebody a lot of
money hes always hard pressed for
enough to meet his payments the last
few days hes been so glum i couldnt
sleep for worrying about him and
that bud hardy has been just as spite-
ful as he could he if that letter you
brought papa was a notice of dismis-
sal theres no telling he might have
felt so desperate as to take the gold
in revenge but im sure he wouldnt
kill anybody-unless-maybe bud
hardy attacked him and he had to
shoot to save himself oh-its-just-
awful

  another storm of grief checked her
words

  barney patted her shoulders

i sure hated to say a word emmy
but youd v found it out from the
neighbors after a while and i thought
it best you should know right away
her sobs grew in volume

  if youll just come down with me
to the ministers ill be able to step in
and take care of you nobody will dare

abuse my wife-

  emily straightened as suddenly as
she had collapsed

 barney donovan-dashing the
tears from her eyes-if you are will-
ing to help me do so like a man but
dont be thinking im so helpless ive
got to marry to protect myself

  barney stared hurt dumfounded
why i wouldnt marry the best man
alive while this disgrace is upon papa
and me she declared proudly if
you are the friend you profess to be
get out and show it-prove papa abso-
lutely innocent before you dare talk
marriage tome

  as an added fling she continued
and you havent proved to me yet
that you did not try to shoot papa in
the back yourself

  barney offered no reply he was
dazed unconsciously he turned upon
his heel and walked out without a word
of parting he was not angry his was
that deep-rooted soul hurt which comes
to those whose honest intentions are
spurned or misinterpreted

  at the assay office he again met
knucker who inquired for carson
barneys reply was a cool negative
knucker departed and the two detec-
tives putin an appearance from them
barney learned that not a footprint
finger mark or wheel track had been
discovered that would indicate how or
where the bullion had been taken

  but much was being gathered from
statements of the miners that added a
sinister light to the already overwhelm-
ing evidence against carson

  also middleman had received a mys-
terious telephone call from some one
vanishing gold



who offered to reveal the stolen cache
if granted twenty thousand dollars and
immunity from arrest

  middleman made a vain attempt to
keep his caller in conversation until
he was located subsequent inquiries
showed that the stranger had called
from one of the bay shore cities and
that he was tall and dressed like a
miner or a rancher

  barney shut himself in the furnace
room to think he fought hard to re-
pel the suspicion that knocked insist-
ently for admission could it be that
carson was really playing a deep crafty
game by which he meant to profit both
in money and liberty

  at the end of an hour he threw down
the crucible he was cleaning and went
into the office

  if the law cant prove barts inno-
cence barney donovan will he mut-
tered

  then he telephoned to the shaft house
and asked that scanlon be sent to him

chapter v

    hats your opinion of bart car-
 son scanlon barney asked
when the two were closeted in barneys
room

  there wasnt a finer man in the out-
fit than him whin he were shift boss

  barney indulged in a slight smile at
the evasion

  what queered him with the men
did they get sore just because he was
promoted 

  theres been many a rumor lad
but one av the raysons for mike scan-
lon not havin a scab on his nose is his
delicate raygard for things that be none
av his business

  barney smiled broadly this time a
confident smile born of his judgment
of the cautious foreman scanlon liked
barney above all other men at the mine
-and barney knew it for that rea-
son he learned much concerning the

mines mysterious past history before
another hour elapsed

   an oim tellin ye lad tis buffalo
hogan yez must buzz about the slide
buffalos got a thumb holt on mighty
near ivery old-timer around molta ex-
cept mike scanlon an buffalo be
know in that oi kape me mouth shut
for the good av me soul

  and mike breathed barney for
the good ef emilys soul and her dads
as well as mine ill keep my own mouth
closed and my eyes and ears wide
open

   oi believe ye lad an oill tell yez
somethin more that knucker man has
worrked here afore now or oive niver
said the truth in all me life yez
asked me for the names av them that
was kilt if the timekeeper has the old
ray cords oi can pick em out there
was one chap a mucker oim remem-
brin they niver did find

  all right scanlon well make for
the timekeeper the minute the watch-
man shows up here again and if you
have nothing important on the slate for
to-night i wish youd stick around in
my place until i get back

  scanlon gave willing assent and
at the watchmans appearance both
started for the mine office the time-
keeper was doubtful as to having the
information as old as barney wanted
but he obligingly made a search of an
obscure filing case fortunately the
pay-roll records for the past six years
were still intact and scanlon was soon
running a calloused blue-nailed fore-
finger down a column of names

  there were fourteen countin bart
in that level the day she slid he ex-
plained as he checked off the names
his memory recalled part av the
crew were stoppin overhand from the
face av the drift when the timberin
began to settle bart he rushed the
gang in with all the extra timbers
handy then headed for the main shaft
on the run to order more he hadnt

run tin yarrds afore the hull thirteen

were buried without a bit av warnin-
an they do be tellin since that buffalo
had warned bart to kape away from
that level altogether

  annyway old pap were the only
one alive av the dozen we found they
niver did find this chaps body

  scanlon thumped his work-hardened
finger on the name jim kerr with
increased emphasis in each tap as he
shot a meaning look at barney

  satisfied with his encouraging start
barney hurried back to the assay office
throughout the forenoon his brain was
a mine of plans in itself when he
went to dinner emily was so moody
and quiet the meal would have been
a dismal affair but for his busy
thoughts even his announcement that
he would not be in for supper did not
draw more than a listless very well
from her lips

  the evening whistle brought scanlon
promptly to the assay office and bar-
ney his pony saddled and waiting lost
no time in getting away

  in town he went direct to the depot
very little of the night operators in-
formation was helpful however and
after stabling his pony barney strolled
to other places he had in mind at
long intervals he sauntered in and out
of hogans saloon hoping to catch a
glimpse of its famous proprietor in
this he failed buffalo was presiding
over the nightly games no longer per-
mitted to run openly

  that was a phase of mining-life rec-
reation that barney was little versed
in nor did he care to be therefore he
made no attempt to visit the gaming
rooms

  on one of his calls at the saloon he
came upon an oddly assorted trio lined
up at the bar-windy tuttle pap
krause and a stranger scenting val-
uable information barney stepped
aside to watch their actions

  windy and the stranger were plying

the old man with liquor which he ap-
peared reluctant to accept the harder
the two persisted the more stubborn
he became tuttle lost patience finally
and began to curse and to shake the
old fellow

  indignant barney stepped forward
to take the weaklings part in a cas-
ual glance into the back-bar mirror
windy caught sight of barneys frown-
ing eyes he paused open-mouthed
clinging tipsily to the bar a sodden
grin creeping into his bony face then
with a lurch he seized krause by the
arm and piloted him to the street the
stranger at his heels

  barneys first impulse was to follow
on second thought he gave vent to a
languid yawn and sidled down the bar
to where the most voluble of three bar-
tenders held forth

  i didnt know old pap krause in-
dulged in fermented joy he remarked
after ordering a fizz a mixed drink
would give excuse for a casual question
or two he reasoned

  its the second time hes kicked up
our sawdust in years vouchsafed the
aproned one deftly breaking an egg
into the mixer

  humph what does he do-buy a
carload at a time or is he something
of a camel in his thirst requirements
how long since his other visit to this
jag market

  he took on a few this morning
might have been yesterday i aint sure
those two greasy coats fetched him in
i gotta hunch theyre trying to skin the
old guy out of something

  what could that nutty old musher
have thats worth skinning him out of 
queried barney with assumed con-
tempt

  dampfino you cant always get
their number ive been hep to a lot
of nuts youd swear was batty but all
the time theres a pay streak in their
noodle thats got the wise ginks peeled
raw
vanishing gold



  barney did not put another question
instead he took off his hat to give the
pencil a chance downing his drink in
hasty gulps when the bartender drew
back the seltzer siphon he tossed the
change on the bar and left out on
the street he lost no time in visiting
the local marshal to whom he put nu-
merous questions relative to the habits
and movements of old krause

  he learned that the old fellow had
tramped into town early the previous
morning decked out for one of his
periodic trips the old man encoun-
tered windy and the stranger in front
of hogans place after a lengthy ar-
gument krause broke from them and
tottered down the street waving his
arms and shouting incoherently

  from the marshals office barney
went to hogans for a last look then
calling for his pony he headed for the
mine west of the mine he guided
the pony into a side trail and ap-
proached the krause cabin

  everything was dark and silent nev-
ertheless he dismounted and knocked
the door swinging open under his touch
inside he noticed a warmth which came
from neither the evening temperature
nor the retained heat of the day

  by striking matches he located a lan-
tern which he lighted and began to
search the room a crude bed filled
with straw but devoid of bedding oc-
cupied one corner running his hand
through the straw he discovered what
he least expected to find-a pair of
high-topped lace boots

  his face was grave as he crossed
the room to a cupboard in passing the
cookstove he noticed heat and found
live coals beneath the ashes at the
cupboard he rummaged through a jum-
ble of cooking utensils and canned
goods a mouse scurried out of a broken
package of cereal and into some papers
on an upper shelf these he jerked
down uncovering a gray sombrero a
hissing exclamation escaped him when

he examined the hat punched in the
sweatband were the letters b c

  utterly discouraged he turned to
where a number of soiled garments
hung from pegs beside the rear door
he looked them over and selected from
among them a pair of moleskin trousers
also a brown flannel shirt torn and
bloodstained in one of the pockets
he found a crumpled envelope directed
to carson and bearing the companys
return address the same envelope he
had delivered to carson the eve of the
robbery

  after a prolonged deliberation he
gathered the incriminating garments to-
gether and carried them out to his pony
returning he examined the ground and
paths around the cabin in the rear
all footprints were overrun by tracks
of rodents in front he could see where
the last man before him had gone to-
ward the creek but his own approach
had obliterated all chance of identifying
them

  he cursed his thoughtlessness then
fastening carsons clothes to the saddle
he replaced the lantern where he had
found it with his foot in the stirrup
preparatory to mounting he noticed
the pony jerk up its head ears pointed
creek ward a twig snapped close at
hand he muzzled the pony with his
hand and listened to a rustling sound
that drew near a moment later a
shadow glided past at some distance
from him

  it was a human figure yet it did not
move like a man a board creaked
as the shadow stepped upon the cabins
excuse for a porch then a light tapping
on the door after a second and louder
series of taps the shadow pushed the
door open and a tremulous voice
called are you there papa

  a multitude of sensations swept over
barney his expression of surprise was
almost profane nearly outspoken em-
ily carson down there at that hour-
and calling for her father


vanishing gold

  barneys temptation was to rush into
the cabin and confront her he evaded
the impulse by mounting and galloping
full speed toward the mine

  scanlon was dozing by cat naps when
barney entered the assay office the
foreman blinked owlishly at him then
at the clock which indicated ten min-
utes of two

  im sure thankful for your accom-
modation scanlon ill see you to-
morrow i need more advice fm all
in now heres a couple of good
smokes

  barney held out two cigars nerv-
ously expecting to be questioned but
whatever cufiosity scanlon felt was not
manifest in his yawning albeit grate-
ful  tis a prince ye be lad as he
passed out into the night

chapter vi

an imperative rapping brought bar-
ney to his feet in a single jump
he looked at his watch to find that he
had overslept a full half hour the
rapping increased accompanied by a
rattling of the doorknob he made sure
carsons clothes were not in evidence
then admitted the caller

  knucker confronted him demand-
ing the combination of the safe more
angered than amazed by the arrogant
request barney refused

  what rasped knucker lower jaw
outtbrust youd better understand
that from now on fm boss around this
mine by middlemans orders

  i dont care if you are hells own
ruler you wont get any safe combi-
nation from me until i hear middle-
mans voice myself retorted barney

  then he slammed the door and be-
gan to dress

  knucker strode wrathfully from the
office fifteen minutes later he was
back accompanied by harper by this
time barney was up and out

  morning donovan greeted har-

per i forgot to tell you yesterday-
middleman sent knucker up to take
carsons place and gave him instruc-
tions to take full charge at once

  im not stopping him am i 
growled barney irritation getting the
best of his temper

  harper shrugged his shoulders non-
committally

  you refuse to obey my order
snarled knucker

  if its the safe combination thats
responsible for your sour ball just be-
lieve fm still refusing until middle-
man gives his order direct to me

  having delivered himself of this ul-
timatum barney went out on his way
to breakfast

  two sleep-stinted nights in succes-
sion plus a seemingly endless chain
of depressing discoveries this over-
shadowed by emilys irrefutable asso-
ciation with her fathers hiding place
reduced barney to mute glumness at
the breakfast table

  his mumbled good morning with-
out the usual emmy his evasive at-
titude throughout the meal and his
wordless departure left his hostess in
another paroxysm of grief in which
sore-felt neglect was not unmixed with
vexation

  en route to the assay office barney
caught an inspiration that sent liim
posthaste in search of scanlon he
found the foreman on one of the lower
levels

  say scanlon youre pretty familiar
with buffalo hogans habits arent
you he asked when the two were
out of eye and earshot of the crews

  oim havin a fair-sized knowledge
av his tricks

  i knew it now everybody knows
hes a roughneck pug that no one in
these parts has been able to lick and
he has a reputation for high speed on
a gun draw besides as you say hes
got a thumb hold on the old-timers but
just the same scanlon hasnt he got
vanishing gold



a queer streak of some kind thats worth
assaying 

  scanlons grizzled head wagged
slowly from right to left in a wary sur-
vey of the adit

  by golly lad pfwhere did yez get
the idee they do say buffalos a
crank on hoodoo numbers an he niver
touches a carrd the day after he has
a certain kind av a nightmare do yiz
iver take a hand at his tables

  no scanlon and whats more i
dont intend to if i can avoid it all

i want-

  listen lad if yez are in no great
hurry oill try for to find out if hes
as bogified as he used to be oi can
let yez know in the momin

  take your time buoyantly help-
ful information is of more value than-
haste ill see you later

  barney pivoted on his heel and
headed for the shaft

  jist another bit av warnin bar-
ney added scanlon taking the same
direction be a bit careful of how
yez spake to the new boss yed better
humor him for a time because-well
yez know pfwhat was said about hold-
in your fire till yez see the white av
the eye

  barney smiled his self-confidence and
rang for the cage nevertheless when
he reached the surface and walked to-
ward the assay office he pondered long
and soberly on the old foremans words

  before he reached the office he
caught sight of knucker ransacking the
desk not caring to meet that domi-
neering official just then he turned
down into the creek bottoms in the
vicinity of the krause cabin he over-
heard windy tuttles drawling voice
also the quavering treble of an older
man pleading for mercy

  he quickened his pace in time to
hear

  ding bust yore hide-bound car-case
yuh tuk it yuh know yuh did now

tell me whar its hid or by jacky ill
crack yore worm-eaten bean

  no no no moaningly dont
hurt poor old pap he never takes
nothing everybody feels sorry for poor

old pap--dont-oh-don-

  the senile pleading ended in a gur-
gle barney mounted the bank in one
leap ten paces away windy stood
over the kneeling figure of old krause
choking and shaking him unmercifully
hey you cur none of that

  the next instant windy went sprawl-
ing stumbling into the underbrush
flung there by a savage sweep of bar-
neys right arm

  windy gaped up and over his shoul-
der in rum-dumb amazement then
went threshing from sight through the
undergrowth

  barney assisted krause to his cabin
the enfeebled old man had been
roughly handled so much so that it
was several minutes before he could
give any rational explanation of what
had taken place but during the brief
period of sanity that did ensue barney
was given a mental view of inner mys-
teries which sent him back to the assay
office with knitted brows and clenched
teeth

  at the hour barney was conferring
with scanlon in the mine emily re-
ceived a visit just as she completed
her mornings work a knock at the front
door surprised -her hope and fear
assailed her heart simultaneously as she
hastened to answer to her dismay
the caller was neither father nor lover

  ah good morning miss carson f
im looking for a private place to board
im the new boss you know knuck-
ers my name announced that indi-
vidual with the dynamic gentleness one
might detect in the bellow of a savage
bull

  emily had thrown the door wide
open a glimpse of her caller caused
her to close it to a less inviting angle


vanishing gold

his announcement reduced the opening
to a two-inch crack

  we do not keep boarders haught-
ily

  oh i wont be much bother you

dont-

  the unappreciative surface of a
tightly locked door flung knuckers
words back into his face a caustic
oath tainted the air as he turned to
leave and the vow he registered would
have caused emily more uneasiness had
she heard it

  as a result of her flare at barney
emily had put in a miserable day and
night the news of carsons untrace-
able disappearance the mystifying bul-
lion robbery the stage holdup and the
murder of bud hardy had spread and
grown like a pestilence the settlement
babblers gathered around her in croak-
ing flocks profuse with platitudes and
prophecies but barren of sympathy and
comfort

  in addition to this she was both pro-
voked at herself for her unstrung re-
sentment of barneys well-meant pro-
posal and half angry at him because
of his apparent intention to ignore her
for it

  noon passed yet he did not come
for his dinner by one oclock she
could stand the suspense no longer and
swallowing her pique and pride she
hurried to the assay office

knucker was alone at barneys desk
when she arrived his eyes glittered
treacherously when he saw her coming
is bar-mr donovan in
without entering she stammered
her inquiry from the doorway

  not now miss but ill sure be
pleased to serve in his place is there
anything i can do for you 

  no i must see him when will
he return

  i cant say hes probably gone to
the city

  emilys face fell in spite of her brav-
ery

  have you heard from your father

yet 

  if vinegar possessed sweetness
knuckers voice was saccharine

  when mr donovan returns please
tell him miss carson would like to see
him about a very important matter
requested emily evasively as she turned
to go

  just one moment miss carson
knucker rose ponderously from the
desk chair

  emily paused an uncontrollable
shiver running over her

  its no use of my mincing words
miss i know all about your fathers
trouble and it happens im in the right
position to help him out of his scrape
ive helped lots of people when theyve
been down and out you see im not
such a bad fellow when you get to
know my ways

  the words were not without effect
although she did not reply

  i havent been received into this
camp very cheerfully continued
knucker emily was tracing imaginary
lines on the porch post and there was
a vulturous gleam in his eyes as he
watched her but i aint taking
offense my turn will come they al-
ways shut the door in my face-at first
after that they come back and lick
my hand but thats what a fellow gets
for not looking like a spoon-fed parlor
entertainer now im going to show
you how square i really am im going
to get your father clear of his jam be-
fore the week is out and all im going
to ask in return is that you treat me
like a human being

  half convinced that she jumped to
a hasty conclusion in her previous judg-
ment of knucker emily felt a twinge
of remorse after all barney might
be mistaken it was not uncommon for
lovers to be jealous of strangers

  she flashed him a warm smile over
her shoulder

  if you will do that great kindness
vanishing gold



for my father you may be sure that
i shall make all amends i possibly can
for shutting the door in your face
she declared gently and just as soon
as papa returns you will be welcome
to call on us at any time

  with her last words she stepped
down and sped up the path toward the
cabins at the same moment barney-
his face chalk white jaw muscles
ridged out like whipcords came around
the corner of the office and mounted
the porch emily had not seen him
and he had arrived only in time to hear
the last clause of her conversation

  knucker stood just inside the door-
way his vicious eyes intent upon his
departing visitor barney entered
glaring straight at the beastlike face
neither man spoke knucker wheeled
insolently and crossed to the desk
while by strenuous effort barney
curbed an inclination to leap upon the
big mans shoulders

  barney was nearer to actual murder
than he had ever been the very care
he exercised in closing his bedroom
door bespoke his deadly anger as to
knuckers secret mind a change of
assayers would occur as soon as a new
one could be engaged

chapter vii

darney locked himself in and spent
considerable time in brooding and
reviling he shook off the mood at
length and arming himself with pad
and pencil tilted his chair against the
wall and was soon lost in the maze of
his mystery of the problem

   althought pap krause had given him
a momentary glance at a mystery
within a mystery such statements must
of necessity be taken with salt owing
to the old mans unsoundness of mind

windy and the stranger were ele-
ments in the case both suspicious and
erratic windys deep interest in the
old man and the accusation which sug-
atb

gested hidden wealth would bear fur-
ther investigation

  the  gun taken from windy gave
him food for thought it was identi-
cal with the one he had loaned emily
in fact both guns were a pair which
he had brought to molta himself and
the one discovered on tuttle was or
should have been in barneys saddle
holster the night before the bullion rob-
bery

  knucker was a factor of real menace
not only to the welfare of the mine
but to barneys peace and happiness
and required close watching if only
for the latter reason

  hogan was the sphinx of them all
any time scanlon made a statement it
could be counted upon as a fact bar-
ney was convinced that the notorious
gamblers heart was a storehouse of
keys that would unlock every solution
but to shatter that stronghold without

destroying precious evidence- the

pencil disregarded the paper in prefer-
ence for the amateur detectives hair

  the evening whistle found him still
unable to locate a path that would lead
him out of die labyrinth it was long
past supper time when he finally laid
his problem aside and went to brave
the late-again rebuke that would greet
his entrance into the carson kitchen

  in his present mood he would have
gone on to the boarding house but on
passing the carsons cabin he saw em-
ily at the wood pile filling her apron
with wood he hastened to relieve her
of the task

  why hello stranger she greeted
mischievousness bubbling to the surface
in spite of her grief

  good evening emmy he answered
sober-faced you know that im not
a stranger in thought he added

   she started to reply and checked her
words by biting her lip then stood gaz-
ing toward the corral where her pinto
was nibbling at the fence she was
between bamey and the last thin cres-

cent of the setting sun as it dropped
behind a ragged sky line and it was
well for his self-control that his arms
were filled with wood

 a tightness gripped his throat as he
carried his load into the kitchen emily
followed but he deposited the wood
in the box and started for another arm-
ful hardly daring to look at her

   i say mis-ter don-o-van have you
forgotten how to talk she inquired
mockingly

   he realized that he was thinking of
nothing worthy to say he was not
angry he was no longer a child he
was just human and the grit in the oil
of his hope was her invitation to
knucker

   he stole a sidelong glance over his
shoulder she stood at the table her
premonitory forefinger pressed against
her teeth the signal was unmistakable
to him and he paused on the threshold

   tve got a lot to tell you as soon
as i fill this wood box he answered

   while they lingered over their sup-
per he recounted many of his recent
experiences wisely omitting any men-
tion of carson or of his midnight visit
to the krause cabin

   after supper the conversation lagged
 yet barney was loath to leave emily
 got out her sewing and a she worked
 she kept the conversation from dying
 out altogether by asking occasional
 questions all subjects exhausted bar-
 ney braced himself to speak of knucker

   i see you called on the new boss
 to-day

  how did you know queried em-
 ily absently as she bit off a thread her
 mind upon other matters

   a white-hot flash swept over barney
 i reached the assay office just as
 you left he answered in a low tense
 tone after a lengthy pause

   emily dropped her sewing into her
 lap her eyes focused upon a framed
 picture her thoughts centered upon her
 father whose face it outlined

  what do you see about this
knucker-

  a timid knock upon the back door
interrupted barneys question emily
whirled as if it had been a pistol shot
one hand flew to her bosom the sewing
slid unhindered to the floor barney
glanced at her inquiringly then stepped
to the door himself on the steps in
the patch of lamplight stood old pap
krause

  got to see emily quick panted
the old man in a mysterious whisper

  all right pap come in and rest
yourself invited barney

  the old man shook his head emphati-
 cally and handed out a slip of paper

  no no no old pap must hurry
home he whined and slunk away in
the thickening shadows

  barney passed the note to emily
then turned to reseat himself a low
pained cry from her caused him to look
around with tears in her eyes she
handed him the note

   emily  will follow this note in half hour
 keep mum on my coming i might be
 mobbed i need clothes and money have
 them ready i wont sty long not safe
 say nothing but do not worry	dad

   emily plied him with innumerable
and unanswerable questions but with
his own mind upset by the situation he
remained silent she replenished the
fire to prepare something to eat then
stole into her fathers bedroom from
which she emerged with his business
suit next she procured her purse from
her own room

   barney gulped as he watched her
dump out a pitifully small amount of
silver coin  his hand went plunging deep
into his own pocket with a result that
several gold pieces all he had with him
joined the heap of lesser coin the
tremulous misty smile which he re-
ceived repaid him with usury

the wrait seemed interminable em-
ily became restless pinning the curtains
down as a double precaution at
vanishing gold

i

length the rear door opened stealthily
and in slipped an apparition in greasy
overalls and jumper

  emily flew to him with a pitying cry
barney placed a chair and seized him
by the hand carson sank into the
seat heavily sighing his exhaustion

 whatever has gone wrong papa
begged emily kissing his sunken cheeks
and fingering a bloodstained bandage
that encircled his head what has
happened to you how are you ever
to clear yourself

   dont pester me with questions now
emily im in no humor to answer
them give me the clothes and the
money buffalo hogan and his rough-
necks have started a double-cross game
im going to finish to their sorrow
middlemans sitting in too and by the
eternal hes going to pay high on the
show-down growled carson bitterly

  oh papa for my sake-for your
own sake-please please dont get
mixed up worse than you are now
pleaded emily the tears beginning to
flow

  dont worry if they keep out of
my road nobody will get hurt except
in the pockefbook wheres my
clothes r

   emily brought out his business suit
  not them irritably my working
  clothes ive a lot of dirty work ahead
  before im through they stole the
  clothes i had but theyll all pay
  carson was cross barney saw it
  and remained in the background not
  daring to offer a suggestion

    sobbing in a dry hysterical way em-
  ily collected an outfit of old clothes
  carson rolled them into a bundle
  picked up three gold pieces from the
  pile on the table then rose to go
  dont let a soul know ive been

 home he cautioned ill be back-

    his words were cut short by a loud
 insistent knock on the rear door em-
 ily gasped neither carson nor bar-
 ney was armed yet both made sugges-

 tive gestures with their right hands
 carson stepped to an inner door and
 let himself into a small pantry nodding
 to the others to admit the visitor as
 he did so

  without thought of carsons suit
draped over a chair or of the money
on the table barney opened the door
hemmerson stood on the steps behind
him was knucker

  howdy hemmerson greeted bar-
ney cheerfully not deigning to notice
knucker

  i hear carson is back better tell
him im here its important i see him
at once spoke hemmerson in his crisp
official tone

  barney glanced meaningly at emily
but did not catch her eye she was re-
garding knucker with an imploring
look the sight whipped his rage into
action to control himself he faced the
sheriff

  where are you referring to when
you say bart has returned parleyed
barney his thoughts racing in search
of a saving loophole

  he was seen to enter this kitchen
not fifteen minutes ago replied hem-
merson eying the suit of clothes and
the coins on the table also the note
which lay beside the money

   emily seemed frozen in the attitude-
 she had taken when the sheriff entered
 the kitchen in a vague way she was
 hoping that knuckers presence meant
 that he was keeping his promise to help
 her father

   barney stepped to the table picked
 up carsons note and dropped it in the
 fire the money he placed in emilys
 purse then he faced the sheriff

  hemmerson i always figured you
 had good sense and eyesight until to-
 night here ive been all evening try-
 ing to cheer emmy out of her troubles
 and helping plan a scheme to make this
 lonesome bunch of money go a long
 ways now you come butting in with
 more trouble havent you any gen-


vanishing gold

 tlemanly consideration for helpless
 women if barts in this house and
 you can find him you sure can do more
 than i give rou credit for doing
 turning to emily he continued
 now emm if youll just give me
 a bit of paper ill wrap up my clothes
 and be going they sure needed press-
 ing bad

   knucker leaned toward the sheriff
and whispered something in his ear
the latter paid no attention he was
weighing barneys words

   you neednt imagine your fine talk
went over my head donovan he said
after a pause but this is a case where
friendship loses out as long as im
sheriff of this county im going after
bud hardys murderer regardless of
whom the blow falls on

   emilys lips parted though no words
came unthinkingly she darted an ap-
prehensive look at the pantry door
hemmerson saw and understood his
face looked grim as he crossed the
kitchen and opened the pantry 

   it was a tense moment for all but
as the door swung open each expectant
watcher received fresh surprise the
pantry was devoid of human presence

   knucker step out and see if my
men outside have noticed anybody try-
ing to leave rasped hemmerson

   knucker made haste to obey while
 hemmerson moved over to emilys
 side

    miss carson if rour father is in
 this house it will make the situation far
 easier if you tell him to come out and
 give himself up to me if he doesnt
 i shall search the place to-night

    i havent the least doubt about it
 you officers have less sympathy than
 a savage dog search it you are going
 to and for all the good it will do
 flared emily

    you mean that your father is not
 in there demanded hemmerson
 pointing toward the front rooms
 exactly he is not there

  hemmerson bent one of his search-
ing looks upon hen she met it un-
flinchingly and he believed

  knucker came in shaking his head
hemmerson reopened the pantry and
inspected its narrow window a wire
screen attached from the outside was
intact the neatly kept shelves af-
forded no hiding place the floor was
bare except for a small square of oil-
cloth upon wrhich he stood to examine
the window

  he stepped out and closed the door
leaning against it for a moment while
he pulled thoughtfully at his ear lobe
then he beckoned for knucker to leave
and started out

  donovan hemmersons head reap-
peared through the half-closed rear
door i know youre befriending these
people but take a piece of wise advice
-dont try to interfere with my duties
thats not only legal warning but a
friend tip good night

  the door closed leaving barney and
emily staring at each other in a ques-
tioning manner emily collapsed into
a chair while barney turned to the
pantry which he inspected with increas-
ing wonderment

  it sure beats me he breathed
stepping back into the kitchen

  emily placed one hand over her lips
as a sign for silence at the same time
beckoning him to her side

  theres a cooler under the pantry
 floor she whispered- papa made it
 a long time ago for the hot days i
 get into it through a trapdoor the oil-
 cloth is nailed to the trap to keep dust
 from falling through the cracks papas
 hid himself in that keep real still till
 they go away

  outside hemmerson and his depu-
 ties circled the cabin repeatedly but
 their flash lamps failed to reveal any
 evidence that carson had made his es-
 cape posting two guards for an all-
 night vigil the sheriff went to the assay
 office to telephone
vanishing gold

s

 within the kitchen emily and bar-
ney kept up a desultory conversation
for almost an hour then emily tiptoed
to the rear door and threw the bolt
her next move was to see that the
front door was also securely fastened
while she was doing this barney cov-
ered the pantry window with a blanket

  trembling with eagerness emily
raised the trap barney standing in
the doorway heard her gasp and moan
whats the matter he whispered
she turned her face pale and fright-
ened but did not speak then she went
limp barney bent forward to look
and gaped his own astonishment in-
stead of any cooler box he was peer-
ing into what seemed like a deep yawn-
ing pit of blackness

chapter viii

h barney this just makes me sick i

oh-

  barney patted the sobbing girls head
tenderly and studied a moment

  emmy he whispered when a feasi-
ble plan took shape in his mind you
asked me to prove your father abso-
lutely innocent im going to do it-to-
night tell me where do you keep a
lantern or a flash lamp

   the words rallied her a few min-
 utes later barney armed with a flash
 lamp lowered himself into the hole
 the light revealed his head about ten
 feet below her

   close the trap emmy he called
 glancing up looks like em in a drift
 til soon find out in the meantime get
 some sleep for yourself if i discover
 anything -serious hi let you know as
 soon as i can if you hear four taps
 on the floor slowlike youll know itjs
 me

   with a wave of his hand he passed
 from sight emily watched until the
 reflection of his light was no longer
 visible then closed the trap she did
 not go to bed however choosing to

sit in the darkened kitchen until she
learned the best or the worst

   daylight came but no barney the
first tinge of dawn above the east ridges
found him slipping noiselessly into the
assay office hemmerson sat in the
swivel chair his feet on the desk mak-
ing up for his lost sleep

  barney gained his room without
wraking the sheriff as he closed the
door he espied a telegram at his feet
the message was from middleman and
informed him in a few terse words that
he was to recognize knuckers orders
without question and that a new as-
sayer would relieve him on the first

   he tossed his hat in a comer ex-
tracted a pencil from his pocket and
reclined on the bed but not to sleep
according to the telegram to-morrow
would be his last day with the molta
mining company yet he was not con-
scious of regret on the contrary a
subtle feeling of relief soothed him
only his discoveries since leaving em-
ily served to depress him he had not
located carson  neveriheiess what he
did see completely squelched the re-
motest hope for carsons innocence

   he had lacked courage to carry his
knowledge back to emily far better
he decided to let her worry through the
night in uncertain hope than to tell her
the inexorable truth yet he nursed a
hope that something reassuring might
turn up before morning

  scanlon came in just before the
whistle blew but said nothing until
hemmerson woke up and hurried out

   have yez seen bart lad he asked
in a loud whisper

   barney answered with an almost im-
perceptible nod

   pf where is he now 

i havent the least idea scanlon
well lad yez had best find him
quick the news be out that hes around
the mine an ivery miners son av them
have sworn to lynch him


vanishing gold

   holy murder v exclaimed barney

 leaping to his feet

   st tis murder all right but dommed
 unholy oim thinkin but yez wanted
 to know about hogan hes that super-
 stitious he goes to frisco ivery onct in
 a while for to have a fortune teller give

him a tip on his luck yez could-

 oill have to be goin lad the boss
 is headed this way

   when scanlon left barneys thought-
 inspiring pencil worked overtime he
 heard knucker enter and make an ap-
 pointment for a long-distance talk with
 middleman allowing a reasonable
 time to pass he then picked up a hand
 mirror and went into the office
 knucker greeting- him with a scowl in-
 tended to intimidate

   ive telegraphic instructions to give
 you the safe combination here it is

  barney pulled down the desk top
halfway then held the mirror so that
it reflected the inner surface of the top
in the mirror knucker saw a strip of
paper bearing the figures and formula

 of the combination

   thats all well see to it that the
 combination is changed on the first
 sneered knucker

   no it is not all you will please
 open the safe inventory its contents
 and give me a signed receipt de-
 manded barney

   humph  just because you and the
rest of your clique in this camp are
thieves you imagine im one too eh
knuckers tone would have enraged a
quaker

   am i addressing a gentleman or a
common bully  asked barney his tem-
per well in hand though the glitter of
his eyes outstared the larger man

   knucker grabbed the chair arms to
rise his mouth working over unuttered 
words a footfall on the porch caused
him to relax he plucked at his un-
shaved chin as hemmerson entered

   youre the right man at the right
 time and place sheriff cried barney

please bear witness while i check the

contents of the assay safe

  thus circumvented in his aggressive
spite knucker acknowledged the care-
fully checked inventory signing a re-
ceipt with ill grace

  an idea came to baraev as he re-
turned to his room he opened the
north window then donning his hat
and coat he went out through the office
locking his door as he left outside
he made sure that no one vra watching
his movements and crawled back into
his room through the open north win-
dow

  eavesdropping under other circum-
stances would have been repugnant to
his sense of fairness with a mans life
at stake however-a life upon which
depended emilys happiness-he felt
justified in his action

  hemmerson was at the telephone
conversing on official business when
he hung up he told knucker that he
would be gone for two or three hours
and if anything turned up to notify the
deputies at carsons cabin

  after hemmersons departure an in-
terval of silence ensued- then barney
heard knuckers heavy tread move to
the front door and close it next he
approached barneys door and tried to
open it from there he went  the fur-
nace room and laboratory

   following these strange movements
 the telephone bell jingled eyes spar-
 kling barney held his breath for fear
 of missing the number knucker called
 there was a short pause then knuck-
 ers low yet distinct rlo--that you
 buff    takea ride at one oclock
 i gotta ee you    you know-jim
    sure-same place    g-by
 barney fairly hugged himself as
 knucker hung up and tramped -out of
 the office when the big fellow was
 far enough away barney exited
 through the window and vrent after his
 pony ten minutes later he was gal-
 loping like mad toward molta
vanishing gold



   emily could scarcely dirg one foot
after the other as she prepared break-
fast for herself and barney worried
by the uncertainty occasioned by bar-
neys nonreturn and exhausted by the
nights experience she was praying that
some miracle wrould snatch away the
gloom and return her father safe and
sound

   the minutes lengthened into an hour
then two yet barney failed to come
a rap at the rear door sent her into
fresh panic

  knuckers coarse good morning
greeted her when she opened it he
stepped inside deliberately she did not
offer him a chair but remained by the
door waiting for him to speak

  did your father show up yet he
inquired leering his conception of a
smile

   emily shook her head wanly

   i guess you must know by this time
that he will be lynched when he does
show up said knucker with brutal
plainness

  emilys face blanched she leaned
against the door post to keep from fall-
ing

  why she gasped

  oh the miners are all dead sore
because he killed bud hardy

  emilys indrawn breath hissed
through her clenched teeth her fingers
intertwined in frantic agitation- for
a moment her mind seemed blank

   now i happen to know where your
 father is hiding volunteered knucker
 patronizingly fact is fm protecting
 him i couldnt afford to tip my hand
 in front of the sheriff last night hut
 i had everything fixed beforehand
 thats the reason he made such a slick
 get-away if you want to see him
  take you out as soon as its dark
 to-night you see he dassnt come in
 or show his face any more till this hul-
 labaloo dies out

    knucker had struck the winning note
 in his lure song for emily replied with-

  out hesitation to be sure i wtill go

i simply must see him just as quick as
i can ill be ready

  all right youve got two horses
in your corral you can loan me one
then we can ride out of camp like were
taking an evening jaunt nobody will
wtise up to our real purpose at all
and knucker departed highly
pleased with himself over his arts of
deception

chapter ix

darneys pony was a mass of
lather when he reached molta
he stabled it arranged for a fresh
horse should he need one on short no-
tice then sauntered toward hogans sa-
loon he had covered the twenty miles
between the mine and molta with every
ounce of speed his pony was capable
of making in order to have an eye on
buffalo hogan and the one oclock ap-
pointment wrherever it was to be kept

  as he strolled down main street
with its alternating stretches of cement
and plank sidewalks its odd blending
of pioneer crudeness with modem ar-
chitecture squat frame buildings with
dingy false fronts sandwiched between
stately structures of brick and stone
as he passed door after door he could
not help but notice the somber-faced
men gathered here and there in pairs
in small groups in large crowds

  some psychic influence was astir in
those murmuring frowning clusters of
rough humanity far down the street
where hogans electric sign loomed
high and large above its many competi-
tors barney could see a crowd of un-
usual proportions

   automobiles and saddled horses lined
the curbs with little space to spare
an eight-horse team drawing an empty
wagon and trailer came up from the
railroad yards and swung skillfully into
a clear space ahead of barney two
men burst from a saloon entrance to
greet the teamster the single word

carson reached barneys ears as he
came abreast ox the trio then the bell
horse shook itself the violent jangle
of bells and clattering harness drown-
ing whatever else was said

  he passed beneath the stationary
awning of the molta opera house
where large-lettered posters still damp
with fresh paste adorned the billboards
barney his mind concentrated upon his
errand gazed at them without compre-
hension not until he was a block away
did their significance penetrate his
thoughts he hurried back to read
them carefulfy

to-night

the three marvels

the marvelous madame de la

seer

mind reader extraordinary foretells futures
reveals pasts

the marvelous professor
sleight

peerless prestidigitator mystifying magician
and illusionist

the marvelous and only
deceptin

the mzm with eighty faces greatest one
of all impersonators

   the marvels themselves emerged
 from the theater and struggled through
 a circle of eager clamoring urchins
 while he was reading he glanced at
 them appraisingly then finished the
 press accounts of their remarkable en-
 tertaining abilities

    a daring scheme germinated in his
  mind unpenciled it grew into a wrell-
  defined plan he wheeled so abruptly
  two girls behind him were almost swept
  from their feet shouting an apoogr
  over his shoulder he starred in pursuit
  of the show people overtaking them
  at the door of their hotel breathlessly
  he requested a private interview

    theres money in it for you and a
  good mans life at stake he panted as
  they stared at him skeptically

  a sharp command in a foreign tongue
by the woman won him consent from
the men who escorted him into the
hotel when the four were seated be-
hind locked doors barney broached his
subject

  are you people willing to give a pri-
vate seance after your regular show
he asked provided of course that
my proposition and terms meet with
your approval he added noting their
dubious looks

  we are open to any paying engage-
ment that will not conflict with our
bookings replied the dapper little man
who had been introduced as professor
sleight

  well gentlemen-and pardon me
the lady-i desire to stage an enter-
tainment for the especial benefit of this
towns most prominent character but
please understand its a strictly- con-
fidential affair no advertising in ad-
vance as to your pay-

   barney paused to deliberate his
slender capital had been banked with
an eye to the future once spent on his
present project there were no chances
of reclaiming it on the other hand
he would be staking his all against an
invincible crook but wrhat was mere
gold as compared with the life of em-
ilys father he rose above his hesi-
tation

    ill guarantee you a hundred dollars
  apiece and foot all expenses myself
  he continued and in case you have
  a bum night at the show house ill try
  and do better by you shall i go on

   by all means urged the woman
  who did not wait for the others to an-
  swer

    the three hitched their chairs closer
  to barney in a few brief sentences
  he outlined his plan and at the close
  of the conference they expressed them-
  selves more than pleased to be of serv-
  ice

   barney advanced money for special
  necessities and left the arranging of a
vanishing gold



private room in the hotel to their pro-
fessional judgment he bowed himself
out promising to return before show
time with another interested party

  he next visited a friendly attorney
to whom he made known his scheme
for breaking buffalo hogans power
and restoring peace at the mine he
left in high spirits

  the lateness of the hour surprised
him so intent had he been upon his
new idea he had entirely forgotten the
rendezvous he had set out to spy upon
everything now depended upon speed
traveling by horse was out of the ques-
tion and he hurried to the nearest
garage

  let her out to the limit he or-
dered of the chauffeur whom he hired

  and that individual obeyed to the ex-
treme of recklessness without a sin-
gle meet they careened up the canon
whipping around curves dashing
through lanes of dense undergrowth
roaring up grades streaking along nar-
row benches of roadway where the least
skid wrould mean death at the bottom
of the gorge

  within a half mile of the mine when
they were taking a down grade willow-
screened curve almost on two wheels
the bent form of old pap krauss
stepped into their path not ten yards
ahead-

  the chauffeur operated horn and
brake simultaneously but with the
downhill momentum and no chance to
turn out he was helpless the speed
was not checked in time to save the
fear-dazed old man

  barney leaped from the car and knelt
anxiously beside the senseless figure
which the fender had tossed aside he
made a hurried examination no bones
seemed broken no cuts were visible
nothing worse was apparent than a
swelling lump on the weather-beaten
forehead he slipped one hand in next
to the old mans heart it was still beat-
ing

  help me place him in the car
driver i dont believe we did worse
than knock him unconscious

  as barney spoke old paps eyelids
quivered then opened

  well pap how do you feel asked
barney cheerfully

  krause regarded the two with a mys-
tified stare

  you know me dont you pap
coaxed barney thinking the old man
was suffering another demented spell

  pap hitched himself into a sitting po-
sition and studied the faces of both
men he felt of his head and fingered
the bruise

  f pears like i know yuh young fel-
ler he said squinting at barney
who are yuh

  it wtas barneys turn to stare in
all his time at the mine he had never
heard krause speak in his present tone
of voice

  oh now im remembrin the stope
caved but wharfs bart an peters an
canby an the rest on em did they

git crar

  barney could have shouted for joy
over paps words it meant that after
five years the old mans mind had
come back it meant another key to the
long-hidden mystery-revelations that
would add another blast beneath ho-
gans pedestal of imperialism and
would perhaps bring carson out of
crimes shadow unscathed

  we dont need to go farther
driver he announced just run your
car over to the cabin you see on the
left i want you to stay there with
pap until i come baek if anybody
happens by while im gone use your
wits dont let a soul question him
send them on their way in a hurry
with krause thus temporarily taken
care of barney struck out for the as-
say office on foot when he reached
it he discovered the obese form of
isaiah middleman waddling toward the
mine in company with knucker


vanishing gold

  he glanced in at the office where
harper and simms were in close con-
versation

  anything new developed yet he
asked

  harpers reply was a laconic nega-
tive

  the old man have anything to
say

  inquired after you is all none of
 us knew where you were he didnt
 seem to care much

  barney hurried away to find scanlon
 an pfwhere have yez been lad
 scanlon asked anxiously wrhen they
 met

   barney told him as brieflyr as possi-
 ble adding

  you must come with me as soon
as you get off  i need your help come
straight to old paps cabin

  oim with ye but tell me lad-
have yez seen bart since last night
no ive really been too busy
why

  he were seen in the crick bottoms
this momin an the byes is huntin
him like hounds if they find him first
theres nothin thatll save his neck
ill see emm maybe she knows
anyway hell not hang if i can get a
running start dont forget though
paps at six

  barney started for the carson cabin
 realizing that in his excitement he had
 overlooked both breakfast and dinner
 emilys greeting was somewhat cool
 when he entered the kitchen in an-
 swer to his first question she said that
 no word from her father had reached
 her since his strange departure in-
 spired by his- successes barney kept
 up a flow of cheerful conversation while
 she prepared his supper she listened
 with little or no comment

  while he was eating she told him
what knucker had proposed to do for
her it had a sobering silencing effect
upon him he toyed with his coffee

spoon for a long time his eyes upon
his plate

  and you are actually going to your
father with that man

  his tone rather than his words
aroused her stubbornness

  i certainly am she retorted
well emmy i know its useless
to argue with you but when its all
over im hoping you may feel just a
wee bit mistaken i vowed to clear
your father im going to do it yet
you wont trust me now youre sell-
ing out to the worst enemy youve got
youre not only selling yourself but

your fathers life and honor-

  not another word barney dono-
van  if you are going to show your
petty jealousy of a mart who is hon-
estly helping papa and me  not lis-
ten to yrou what are you doing to
keep your word  youre never around
when you are needed with your own
lips you tell me youve been hobnob-
bing with show people right when papa
is wandering about with his head in-
jured maybe hes sick and hungry
you know these dirty miners are just
itching to hang him the minute he shows
his head and yet you go chasing off
to molta at the most critical time if
you havent faith enough in me to trust
me with knucker you had better cut
loose now i can take care of myself
emily was scathingly indignant and
it brought a noticeable droop to bar-
neys shoulders he stood up regard-
ing her with a wordless soul-hurt look

   all right emmy ill not bother you
any more  do my share without in-
terfering with your plans ill say good
afternoon-he hesitated slightly then
extended his hand-and xor fear its
good-by lets shake hands like good
friends

  the tears were rising with over-
whelming force barney passed out
the door in a blind stupor and when
the door clicked shut emily rushed to
her bed to sob out her misery unchecked

chapter x

portunately for barney his
mind was not permitted to dwell
upon his love troubles long he noted
that the sheriffs guard at the carson
cabin had been doubled he wrondered
if the incriminating passage beneath the
cabin had been discovered

   when he came in sight of the assay
office middleman and knucker were
just entering he swore roundly for
he was anxious to get to his room at
once without being disturbed he over-
came the difficulty by means of the
north window

   once insfde he listened to make sure
that his entrance had not been heard
in the office he heard knucker leave
and then middlemans choppy choleric
voice berating some one over the tele-
phone

  some newcomer trod heavily into
the office as middleman rang off and
barney would have turned to accom-
plish his original purpose had not the
voice of the watchman held him at the
door

  howdy middleman kin i have a
private word with yuh r greeted cya-
nide from the porch door

  middleman still panting from his
wordy tirade at the phone settled into
the swivel chair and blinked at his
caller

  how do you do-er-what is your
name he rumbled

   sutters my name bill sutter an-
swered cyanide advancing to the desk

  glad to see you sutter you are
welcome to a private interview if your
business is important you are the
night watchman are you not 

   yep thats me

  very well what is your trouble-
if it is trouble

   waal i dropped ia tuh-see yuh on
this here robbery question replied
sutter fve been doin a little scout-
in on my own hook i dont reckon

yuhd grudge me  life-sized grubstake
if i git that bullion back fur yuh
sutter leaned awkwardlv over the desk
as he finished speaking

  middleman hitched his chair for-
ward rubbing his fat palms together
beneath the desk top the eavesdrop-
per in the next room trembled with
suppressed excitement

  and you have found out where it
is who took it and how it was taken
inquired middleman in a purring tone

   sutter stared at the ceiling an instant
then fixed his disconcerting eyes full
on the presidents face

   yep he replied

   again the swivel chairs pudgy occu-
pant rubbed his hands his face beamed

  thats fine and was it any one
around the mine

   sutter wagged an affirmative his eyes
glittering in a way that gave middle-
man an inexplicable chill

  ah-and it was-

  middleman leaned well forward to
better catch the reply to his unfinished
question

   whatll be cornin tuh me if i tell
yuh 

  the president settled back heavily
frowning his annoyance at the unex-
pected reply

  you will receive the reward which
the company has offered and advertised
-five thousand dollars

  an do i git all that money if i
only tells whar them bars is hid

  if you know who took the gold
why are you asking such nonsensical
questions snapped middleman

  look-a-here middleman flared
sutter in a metallic tone i aint no
hand fur gassin ive played cards
straight from the deck fur moren forty
years the president fidgeted sketch-
ing aimless figures on the desk blotr
now ill jest toss my hand on the
table an yore welcome tuh play agin
it as hard as yuh please
o

vanishing gold

  he paused striving to catch the other
mans eye

  i kin tell yuh how the stuff wuz
taken an who tuk it-but i wont
he continued when middleman failed
to look up i kin show yuh the bul-
lion nary an ounce missing an inside
o twtentyfour hours-but itll jest cost
yuh a twenty-per-cent rake-off

  middleman sat erect with a sudden-
ness that threatened to capsize his chair
you you

  apoplectic symptoms rendered fur-
ther utterance impossible at the mo-
ment sutter waited silent unper-
turbed

  so youre the scoundrel who did
that telephoning  shouted middleman
finally why i ought to call in the
sheriff without another wrord

  all right suit yoreself but jest
let me give yuh a little advice-if yuh ye
hankerin right hard arter that bullion
dont be so all-fired anxious tuh bust
them buttons offn that calerco vest o
youm

  middleman fingered his collar and
mopped his temper-heated face he
was not intimidated but the blazing
eyes of cyanide were hard to meet

  just repeat your proposition he
requested in a calmer tone

  thar aint much tuh repeat mister
uh give me twenty thousand dollars
in cash an a promise not tuh arrest
me no time an til take yuh-straight
tuh whar them hrots is planted
twenty-thousand-dollars 
middleman puffed swelling like a
pouter pigeon the baggy- pouches
beneath his protruding eyeballs twitched
spasmodically--his fat lips sagged
apart he even forgot to chew the un-
lit cigar which hung from them his
first attempts to speak produced animal-
like snorts then

  you-go-plumb-twenty thou-
you infernal idiot ill have you ar-
rested for extortion-blackmail-this
very minute

  barney longed to snicker he re-
gretted his inability to watch the ex-
traordinary- proceedings in the office

  waal mister middleman yuh kin
jest sit thar an holler till yore guzzlers
dry i aint got no more tuh say unless
yore willin tuh divvy the pot ill put
yuh onter the stuff at my price but i
aint tellin nobody who did it-sabe
middleman compressed his lips and
drummed on the desk

   dont yuh figger on findin it con-
tinued cyanide  cause its planted so
slick that hellll melt it afore yuh folks
gits a smell even them that tuk it aint
knowin whar its gone tuh but jest
give me my price an yuh kin have
em all pronto if yuh dont corde
acrost ill close my trap an yuhll
be out the hull wad what be yuh
sayin pardner

  sutter leaned over middleman like
a mountain lion tensing its muscles for
a spring the turkey red in the presi-
dents flabby cheeks faded to dingy
gray his features became a study in
changing expressions in the bedroom
barney waited for the reply with bated
breath

  get a chair and sit down sutter
spluttered middleman struggling to
control his voice and let me explain
some points you have apparently over-
looked

  sutter relaxed but remained stand-
ing

  why not come clean with your in-
formation  surely you dont consider
five thousand dollars a despisable sum
do you

  ive talked more now than im used
tuh savin snapped sutter in a tone
of finality and backing toward the door

  then i defy you ill order your
arrest at once middlemans voice
again ran the ascending scale

  say mister if yuh knowed me bet-
ter yuh wouldnt waste no time try in
to call my hand
vanishing gold



  ill call your bluff though ill make
 you talk v

 huh the feller that kin make
cyanide bill talk aint been bomed yet
if yuh aint ready to agree in the mom-
in ill draw down my bet an yuhll
lose the hull outfit so long

  middleman shouted hold on but
sutter was striding rapidly toward the
mine

  barney favored himself with a grin
his sympathies were with the watch-
man for the moment he grabbed for
the pencil of inspiration and began to
mull over sutters statements relative
to the hidden gold

  intuitively he felt that the finale of
climax was close at hand he dared
not trust altogether to old paps un-
stable mind windy and the stranger
might or might not be the guilty ones
but time was too precious to waste in
putting them to any third-degree tests
carson was undoubtedly a victim
gagged by threats at any rate he
could not be located or depended upon
before too late

   ltnder stress of impatience barney
struck fist against palm everything
hinged on buffalo hogan and the pos-
sibility of madame de la seer secur-
ing priceless information by means of

her arts if that failed- barney

pocketed his pencil so savagely that it
went clear through the vest lining fail-
ure was not in his vocabulary he as-
sured himself

middleman was still in the assay
office and barney impatient to get into
action exited through the north win-
dow once more and started for paps
cabin by the way of the arrayo

   krause was a-sleep when he reached
  the cabin

   hes been pacm around fer a couple
  of hours all the time talkin about
  slides and fellers thats been dead fer
  five years explained the chauffeur
  then he begun ter complain about his

head hurtin him so i fed him a little
licker an made him go ter bed

  fine work declared barney ex-
uberantly cheerful let him sleep
well have another passenger with us
as soon as the whistle blows then a
nice job of making town at a gait
thatll scorch all records

  krause awoke before scanlon ap-
peared the old man seemed none the
worse for his accident and except for
that hazy void of five years in his mem-
ory he wras as sane as ever

  barney prepared him something to
eat after which he ventured a few cau-
tious questions without results
krause remembered barneys face but
could not recall events or associations
later than five years previous when the
fatal slide had all but takenhis life

  with scanlon it was different
when the foreman arrived krause
greeted him as a long-separated friend
only barneys urgent request for an
immediate start checked the restored
miners volubility

  in town barney piloted krause and
scanlon into the hotel through a side
entrance just in time to meet the mar-
vels who were departing for the the-
ater after the introductions barney
mentioned his uneasiness over the ques-
tion of luring the wily gambler into the
trap the rapid-talking seeress begged
to have the proposition left entirely in
her hands to which all acceded al-
though barney retained a secret lack of
confidence in her ultimate success for
this reason he excused himself and
went out alone

   the street was thronged with an un-
usual crowd attracted there by antici-
pations far more sinister than the show
peoples mysticism barney realized
this before he had traversed two blocks
trouble was in the atmosphere lurk-
ing in the shadows passing from mut-
tering lips to eager morbid ears

   king lynch was abroad in ill-fitting
disguise and his worshipers were im-
vanishing gold

bibing the liquid courage that primed
them for the coming orgy

  hogans place was packed- barney
would not have lingered had he not seen
jostling rows in front of the bar he
wormed his way forward until he stood
against the glass and bottle-littered
stretch of mahogany and almost oppo-
site the famous proprietor

   furtively barney studied the man in
no way surprised that he should be
known as buffalo standing six feet
two broad massive shoulders long
powerful arms and enormous hands
he was to say the least a formidable
giant

  but his head was a study in itself
his hair always close-cropped grew
well down over his high straight fore-
head in a v-shaped point giving him
a low-browed appearance the large
yellow-flecked eyes washed-out blue in
color were set under bristled brows
when angered his eye pupils contracted
to tiny piercing dots and the flecks
glinted like sparks of electricity an
aggressive chin of abnormal length also
a large flattened nose were signposts
of his combativeness even his ears
were out of proportion to his bull-like
head and neck and his lips were per-
petually compressed in the thin straight
line scarcely moving when he spoke
to any one

  for all his own well-cons erved
strength barney felt a mere pigmy in
the presence of the gigantic saloon
man

  at that moment two extra loud and
bibulous patrons on barneys right in-
vited buffalo to drink with them and
volunteered information that carson
was at last cornered in the mine

   buffalo accepted the invitation with
tolerant nonchalance breathing an oily
expression of sympathy for the hunted
mans lot

  from the one-sided conversation
which followed barney gleaned knowl-
edge that set his blood afire with in-

dignation carson vas to be hanged at
daylight even at the cost of a pitched
battle with hemmersons posse i

  some one shouted all aboard for
the big showr i and with a ribald up-
roar two-thirds of the crowd surged
streetward bound for the opera house

   barney his eyes registering righteous
wrath over the mobs intentions was
unconsciously staring at hogan yet his
thoughts were swiftly groping for some
means of forestalling the coming trag-
edy buffalo caught barneys stare
quick to sense an antagonist he stepped
forward and leaned over the assayer

  what seems to be your difficulty
young fellow he growled through set
lips his great eves fixed with their
most intimidating glare

  barneys muscles grew rigid his
thoughts concentrated upon the speaker
but he offered no reply

  the battle of eyes continued until it
attracted the attention of all within the
saloon instantly there came a dead
ominous hush

  but for once buffalo had encountered
eyes that would not down before his
own his great chest swelled with in-
drawn breath his knuckles showed
white as his hands gripped the edge of
the bar

  oh i getcha he sneered through
his nose youre thatrnilk-fed assayer
of carsons

  a dangerous smile flickered an in-
stant at barneys lips and in his eyes
beyond that he made no sign

  buffalos gaze dropped to barneys
left arm the latters right hand rested
on the bar the left was below buffalos
line of sight at that unmistakable hint
bamev exposed his left hand without
once shifting his eyes

  the situation was proving irksome
to hogan to- cover his embarrass-
ment he glanced impressively at his si-
lent awe-inspired watchers then back
at barney
vanishing gold



  say kid get next to yourself beat
 it before somebody spanks you 
 barneys ears turned bright red his
 lips dead white he craned forward
 until his face was close to that of the
 saloon man

  you seem to be something of a king-
 pin around this town buffalo hogan
 lets see now just how far your author-
 ity goes i demand you to call off this
 hanging social of yours

  hogan snorted derisively an on-
looker snickered

  theres the door kid and youre
 all together bellowed hogaru

  fvery wel buffalo if bart car-
 son hangs ill kill you in a man-to-man
 fight-guns knives or fists 

  barney paused to note the effect of
 his warning then strode from the sa-
 loon his own heels making the only
 sound that was heard

chapter xi

a tumult of emotions surged in
barneys breast as he walked
from hogans to the hotel sober sec-
ond thought on his impulsive threat to
kill buffalo did not give him much com-
fort and he was anxious to confide in
the cooler-headed scanlon

   at the hotel he was disappointed
 both scanlon and krause had con-
 cluded to take in the show he tried
 to wait until their return and succeeded
 -for ten minutes then his unrest
 drove him to the theater

 there he found that not even stand-
 ing room was available let alone locat-
 ing his friends in the audience as
 he started back along the semideserted
 street- his- thoughts revertedto emily
 and the evil-eyed man in whom she
 had pinned her trust in concentrating
 his energies upon the problem of en-
 trapping hogan he had almost forgot-
 ten the equally dangerous knucker

 this is no place for me he mut-
 tered scanlon and the lawyer can

watch this end of the game i belong
at the mine

   with one of his abrupt turns he hur-
ried to the hotel scribbled a note for
scanlon then secured his pony and gal-
loped rapidly out of town en route
for the mine

   emily found it impossible to define
her sensations as evening drew near
throughout the afternoon misgivings
as to the wisdom of her faith in
knucker lessened the comfort of her
anticipation she prepared supper far
barney at the usual time confident that
his good nature would bring him in
spite of their noontime quarrel

  when darkness fell without his ap-
pearance she became first alarmed then
angry leaving a spiteful note where
he might see it should he come in after
her departure she seated herself in the
darkened kitchen to await knuckers
coming

   it was a long wait she had all but
given him up when finally he knocked
at the door she pointed out her
fathers saddle to him and while she
saddled goo-goo herself she realized
that she was equally as restive as the
pinto when she started to mount
knucker stepped forward to assist her
he was unnecessarily familiar yet she
attributed it to his clumsiness and said
nothing perturbed nevertheless by the
odor of alcohol on his breath

  one of hemmersons deputies ap-
proached inquiringly knucker said
something to him in a low tone and
the man returned to his post

   ivnucker led the way down the molta
road until they passed the krause
cabin at this point he turned to his
left and followed a trail leading south
emily was puzzled by the turn when
she recalled the report that her father
had been seen in the mine only a few
hours previous

  from time to time knucker endeav-
ored to start conversation but with-


vanishing gold

out success emily enjoyed her own
thoughts better the ride lasted for
miles without interruption the moon
had not yet risen still she was able
to note that they were going higher
and deeper into the hills

  finally knucker swung out from the
tangle of copper-blighted bull pine and
scrub oak and into a heavily timbered
canon thirty minutes later he drew
up before a cabin barely visible amid
the undergrowth

  well here we are he announced
in a hoarse whisper as he dismounted

  emily dropped hastily from her sad-
dle for fear he would attempt to help
her down

  go inside and wait he commanded
fbut dont strike a light until i come
in ill bring your dad after i put these
nags where they wont be seen

  although emily obeyed him the first
suspicion of treachery she had yet ex-
perienced crept upon her the interior
of the cabin gave out a dank odor of
wildness and unoccupancy rodents
scurried about unseen

  knucker came in alone and struck
a match in the flare of its blaze she
saw an evil triumphant smile on his
face as he lighted a lantern which he
placed upon a patched filth-covered
table

  is papa coming she asked quell-
ing the tremor that tried to dominate
her voice

  i called him hell be right along
you see hes careful about showing
himself in a hurry wrants to make sure
he aint being tricked again

   emily buried her hands in the pockets
of her sweater and surveyed the room
a dilapidated soap box and a short log
up-ended were the only available seats
and with the table constituted all the
furniture a crude mud-and-stone fire-
place crumbling with age wras built
into the end wall the three small win-
dows were tightly boarded leaving the
stout plank door through which they

had entered as the only means of exit
dirt twigs and leaves filled the comers
and littered the rough board floor an
uncontrollable shiver shook emily as
her eyes came back to knucker

  sit dowm miss and rest while were
waiting theres a few things til put
you wise to about your dad and this
trip of ours

  again emily shivered though less
violently she needed no further as-
surance than his words and manner to
convince her she had entered a trap of
some sort nevertheless she felt an
exceptional presence of mind and
seated herself without exhibiting her
true feelings

  under pretense of adjusting his belt
knucker shifted a gun and holster into
plain sight and easy reach then began
to talk

  now miss carson it is not my
intention to go back on my word about
helping your father but theres one
thing youve got to promise me before
i do my part oh dont get uneasy 
he interposed as emily darted a fright-
ened look at the door yrour dad wont
be along for a couple of minutes yet
and i want you to get a complete idea
of my plan before he shows up

  she looked at him searchingly

   to start with ill tell you that car-
son didnt kill bud hard tickles you
does it well just you remember this
theres only one man to go to the front
and say so-thats me oh dont get
excited i aint going to open my face
until you say just what i wrant you to
is that plain

  during his talk emily fell to watch-
ing two insects that fluttered around
the lantern globe when he paused she
flashed him an indignant look then re-
sumed her study of the insects

  i can tell you that right now your
dad is bottled up in the mine by the
sheriffs posse but as soon as its day-
light the miners are going to give the
posse the run and take care of your
vanishing gold



dad themselves and you know those
miners have their own style of handling

such cases-

  thinking swiftly seriously emily
now broke in with i dont mind tell-
ihg you to your face that you are lying
it has been proved beyond all doubt
that papa took the bullion out of re-
venge and then shot bud hardy to keep
him from telling what he knew

  do you really think so leerfcd
knucker

  im so positive you cannot convince
me otherwise declared emily with a
contemptuous shrug

  then you dont happen to know that
bud hardy knocked your dad on the
head swiped his clothes and chucked
him onto a freight train the night he
intended to go to frisco you dont
happen to know that hardy gave tut-
tle your dads clothes and peddled the
gun and watch at hogans bar theres
a lot more to the story but how does
that much of it sound to you 

  emily shook her head in a listless
manner

  that may be your story but it
doesnt prove that papa did not take the
bullion from the safe himself she re-
plied

  well if they put the noose over an-
other fellows neck instead of your dads
in the morning itll be very apt to
loosen that same fellows tongue but
here i aint got time to waste on any
gab fest if you intend to save your
dad speak quick-give me a promise
ill answer you when you tell me
what to promise first you tell me
papa is here then that hes in the mine
which am i to believe dont sit there
grinning like a baboon speak out and
let us be getting back before it is too
late

  knucker chuckled inanely

all in good time chicken he an-
swered well go when you promise
to many me and after weve ridden
into molta to-night after the marry-
atb

ing squire says two equals one if you
act nice and ladylike well be back at
the mine in time to give the big scare a
grand-stand finish-

  and if i refuse emilys tone was
icy

  why if youre foolish enough to
refuse right here we stay until your
dads heels no longer touch the ground
then well go back but youll be a
mighty sorry girl lots of people at
the camp saw you ride out with me
they think youre ducking before the
trouble starts and when you do get
back i dont think youll feel much
like telling them-the-truth 

  and in the meantime what shall
i do with this

  knucker grunted in genuine surprise
all through the interview emily had
sat with her hands folded in her lap
but as she coolly put her last question
he saw himself covered with a busi-
nesslike revolver

  he breathed heavily and licked his
thick lips

  looks like youd use it fast enough
whats my move to be he asked in
husky fear

  toss your gun on the floor behind

     f

me

  he moved as if to obey but with a
lurch amazingly swift for one of his
bulk he sent lantern and table crashing
to the floor at the same time throwing
himself sidewise toward the wall

  the room went into instant darkness
then followed a wearisome soul-try-
ng siege emily suppressed her breath-
ing with difficulty straining her ears
to catch some sound of her enemy not
knowing that his actions were identi-
cal with her own neither dared to
move for fear of attracting gunfire
from the other

  the suspense soon became agony she
hati leaped to her feet when knucker
smashed the lantern but had not moved
since the slightest relaxation of mus-


vanishing gold

cles would have afforded her relief
yet she feared the risk as the mo-
ments of silence dragged by she felt
that she must either scream or collapse

  how long the strain lasted she could
not tell once hearing a horse sneeze
her hopes rose only to die when no
cheering hoofbeats followed the at-
mosphere became stifling she wondered
if this would overcome her in spite of
her vigilance

  a faint creak then a scraping sound
roused her rigid watchful she held
her weapon ready for attack suddenly
the door opened closing instantane-
ously dawn was just breaking and
for that fleeting instant a body was out-
lined against the lesser darkness beyond
the door almost without thought she
fired a loud oath was drowned by the
slam of the closing door iron rasped
against iron

  knucker had made his exit quickly
fastening the door outside emily
leaped forward vainly seeking a latch
a volley of blasphemous abuses came
to her ears through the thick panels

  just for that youll stay there till
you rot hi plug you the minute you
show your head he cursed

  in the silence that followed emily
sank to her knees with a choking sob
instead of helping matters her impul-
sive shot had made the situation even
worse now her father would be killed
long before she could reach him with
news of his innocence

  barney turned his pony loose in its
corral below the assay office then went
direct to the carson cabin two dep-
uties who were still on duty flashed
their lights over him as he approached
but with a cool nod he passed and en-
tered the kitchen

  he rapped on the inner door call-
ing emilys name when a second rap
brought no answer he lit the kitchen
lamp to discover her note

  for a long time after he read it he

stood with one leg flung over the cor-
ner of the table mechanically tearing
the note into tiny bits and allowing
them to sift through his fingers his
face appeared haggard his eyes
strained a look accentuated by fatigue
and loss of sleep if he had only had
the least inkling of her whereabouts he
would have gone in pursuit he would
have brought her back even if he had
to kill knucker to accomplish the res-
cue

  at length he sighed and after ex-
tinguishing the lamp stumbled wearily
out the door he had not realized how
tired he was until he read that dis-
couraging note

  out in the cool night air under a
deputys curious eyes memory of other
work to be done within a diminishing
period of time swept all heartaches
aside once again his unconquerable
spirit blazed into action and sent him
swiftly toward the assay office

  the building was deserted when he
entered but insead of going to his bed-
room he entered the furnace room and
fumbled about in the dark later
armed with a pick and shovel he passed
out through the office and was soon lost
to view in the creek bottoms

chapter xii

as the stars dulled before the advance
of dawn an unusual influx of
mounted men was noticeable above and
below the mine property an occa-
sional auto also drew up within pistol
shot of the mine settlement its grim-
faced passengers close-tongued heavily
armed slid from their seats and dis-
appeared ghostlike into the gray gloom
of the undergrowth

  even at the mine an undercurrent of
disquiet was manifest night crews
neglected their work to gather in whis-
pering groups and to cast malevolent
glances at any deputy who attempted to
draw near hemmersons men were
vanishing gold

 

outnumbered ten to one seeming like
stray watchdogs amid droves of wolves

  middleman unsuspicious of the com-
ing clash intent only upon the lost
bullion rose with the first streak of
daylight and made a round of the sur-
face workings reaching the assay office
in an irritable frame of mind

  he telephoned to the boarding house
for knucker nearly exploding when
told that the superintendent was not
in his room nor had occupied his bed
that night

  his next call for harper brought
both detectives to him in a hurry the
three were soon involved in a wordy
interview that assumed the character
of a quarrel it closed abruptly when
middleman happened to glance out the
west window and espy cyanide bills
familiar figure on the arroyo bank

  memory of the watchmans dar-
ing proposition swerved middlemans
thoughts into another channel call-
ing harper he hurried with fat-ham-
pered speed toward the arroyo sut-
ter hearing him approach gaped over
his shoulder in a vicious stare

  looks like yuh win he muttered
thickly

  win what barked middleman

  why them inots o course yuh
found em theyre gone snarled cya-
nide

  what-what do you mean yelled
the president

  by this -time the latter with the de-
tectives at his heels was near enough
to observe the bottom of the arroyo
instead of the usual scum-covered pool
there was now an expanse of slimy
green mud with only a suspicion of
water ill its center

  middleman gazed from the empty
pool to sutters puzzled face then
turned to harper

  place this man under arrest he
shouted im overfed on trickery
ive-take him away

  a scornful thin lipped smile twisted
cyanides face

  jest yuh change them orders mis-
ter middleman an git these tenderfeet
outer my way i aint filched none o
yore gold an i aint intendin tuh lessn
yuh give me a clar title tuh it fur a
long spell back ive knowed yore inots
would show up missin some day an
i wuz aimin tuh sit in on the game fur
a grubstake i knowed all the time
them inots wuz cached in that thar
skeeter nest now some measly cuss
has swiped inots pond an all maybe
yuh did an its sure topped my hand

  neither harper nor simms made a
move as they listened to sutters decla-
ration

  are you all dead yelled middle-
man isnt some one going to obey
my order

  both detectives stepped forward but
hesitated when sutter flashed an ugly-
looking six-shooter into view

   jest one more step an ill make
buzzard grub o the hull crowd thar
aint goin tuh be no arrestin take place
here the man that follers me better
fetch his own hearse

  middleman vas mad recklessly so
his detectives halted in discreet silence
but the president kept on

  stand back middleman

  cyanides drawl would have sent old-
timers scurrying for bullet-proof cover

  i aint used tuh givin no second
warnin this here gunll speak next

  but the obese president seeing noth-
ing hearing nothing except the wings
of his vanishing gold kept on sutters
gun roared its shot scorching middle-
mans right ear he stumbled taking
one more step to regain balance came
ahother vicious report and a small fur-
row opened between his feet dirt and
grit showered over him he threw up
his hands convulsively then reeling
toppled over the bank and rolled down
the slope to the pool

  breakfast time came at the mine
boarding house but no breakfast
yielding to the lure of excitement the
cook and his helper had lingered too
long at moltas joy fountains after the
show and were still lingering becalmed
befuddled noisy restless miners
swarmed at the closed dining-room
door some genuinely tired from all-
night labor others excited the majority
more or less drunk and all hungry

  the boarding boss fumed around the
kitchen in an effort to pacify the clam-
oring horde cyanide bills two shots
came to the distressed mans relief

  the quivering needle of attention
swung instantly arroyoward as those
two whiplike reports cut the air
everybody started for the assay office
on the run opposite carsons cabin
their attention was again diverted

  carsons pony came trotting up the
trail knucker was in the saddle reel-
ing in wide circles like a man drunk
when crowd and pony met the rider
toppled and slid limply from the sad-
dle-dead 

  in the same breath a man came run-
ning from the shaft house at top speed

  carsons out hes escaped yelled
the runner

  those who had stooped to examine
the shattered blood-drenched right leg
of the dead man shouted

  its carsons work the murdering
cur hunt him down every man of
you

  a familiar sombrero was exposed an
instant at the rear of carsons cabin
in a twinkling the mob cry rose from
many lungs spreading like a breeze-
fanned grass fire

  hes in his cabin-bring him out-
tear it down-burn it-hang him up
were the yells that swelled in volume

  the two deputies took a defiant stand
on the cabin porch but with derisive
yells the mob spread into a skirmish
line its flanks sweeping around the
cabin like a monster claw

  the foremost runners dashed for the
rear door only to come to a startling
halt barney arrayed in carsons
clothes and armed with two automatics
suddenly appeared on the steps from
within

  but the pause was only transitory
as soon as they realized that barney
was all they had to contend with they
prepared to rush him en masse he
tried to speak and was instantly hooted
into silence he raised the automatics
and trained them on the leaders

  angry growls greeted his act far
from being cowed they were doubly
enraged because of his interference
with their revenge a rock whistled
past his head splintering the door panel
behind him another struck him a
numbing blow on his left shoulder his
face blanched from pain yet he smiled
-a smile of stubborn defiance his
grip slowly tightened on the gun butts

  a dozen hands appeared above the
heads of the mob each containing rocks
or bricks barney fired one high shot
as a warning the hands dropped but
here and there men began to draw guns
these were immediately whisked from
view by cooler heads who had no wish
for barneys life

  the rock throwers let loose their vol-
ley hitting barney twice he let two
shots kick up the ground at their feet
then elevated the muzzles resolved to
make the rest of his shots collect their
toll

  unseen by him a lariat whirred
through the air from one side dropping
neatly over his head clamping his arms
to his sides the coup was greeted with
yells of profane glee willing hands
seized the lariat and helpless barney
was jerked from his feet to be dragged
ruthlessly from the steps and over the
rocky ground

  then the majority of the blood-lust-
ing mob surged toward the kitchen
door

chapter xiii

emilys despair was fleeting rea-
son brought her to her feet with
redoubled determination daylight had
grown and enough light now streamed
through cracks to enable her to move
about freely

  as a chance of escape the door was
hopeless the windows equally so with-
out bar or sledge to remove the firmly
spiked boards and nothing appeared
available she turned to the fireplace
intending to dig loose one of its bowl-
ders a faint streak of light seeping
through its back wall gave her a better
idea

  she sped to the log tipping it she
rolled it across the hearth by rocking
it back and forth she had an effective
battering-ram

  long minutes of hard -exhausting
work during which time she was nearly
choked by dust bruised and cut by fall-
ing stones and chunks of dry mud
tested to the limit of her strength she
emerged into the open air

  she staggered twice around the cabin
but knucker was nowhere to be seen
wholly unnerved by fear that he had
gone taking her pinto with him she
sank sobbing to the doorstep

 oh daddy daddy how can i-

  a shrill neigh interrupted her wailing
cry with a glad hello she sped in
the direction from whence it came a
hundred yards down the trail she found
goo-goo nickering his joy knucker
had evidently turned him loose but the
bridle rein having caught on a broken
limb the pinto had made no attempt
to break away

  no spurs were needed on the home-
ward trip ears flattened nostrils
spread eyes flashing the pinto heeded
neither rocks nor ruts two miles were
covered before emily was able to locate
herself then with sinking dread she
realized the miles of tortuous trail
which lay between her and the mine

  knuckers gloating prophecy rang in
her ears tore at her heartstrings un-
able to banish the fear that a life de-
pended entirely upon her she gave goo-
goo full rein

  mile after mile slipped beneath the
animals flying hoofs a gentle breeze
blew in her face on it the echo of sut-
ters shots drifted far she thought
her heart stopped beating when those
portentous sounds broke the morning
stillness

  by trail a mile remained to go
cross-country a fraction of time and
distance might be saved reining the
pinto sharply to her left she urged him
to greater speed

  his blood afire with the lure of the
chase goo-goo went crashing over a
brush-littered knoll leaped a dry wash
that would have checked a veteran and
dislodged a mihiature avalanche of
small pebbles as he charged up the last
xidge

  a third shot barked as he reached
the top one glance at the mob around
her cabin revealed the stride of tragedy
below emily screamed  no one heard
except the pinto who dashed down to
the creek with redoubled speed

  in great muscular leaps the animal
lunged up out of the creek as if spurred
by the two last shots he needed no
guiding before the brutal rope wielders
were aware of his coming the pinto
was on them his teeth caught the
foremost man a vicious nip in the shoul-
der the second ruffian wrent down be-
neath the racing hoofs the rest broke
and ran in cowardly fear

  emily her tarn gone her hair
streaming slid from the charging pinto
and sped to the now unconscious vic-
time who lay face downward in the
dirt lacerated bleeding motionless
she turned him gently then screamed

  middlemans ludicrous descent ended
far out in the arroyo bed as he rolled
into that basin of ooze five heads ap-
 o

vanishing gold

peared above a clump of bushes half-
way down the bank the detectives
and cyanide stared at them in surprise
only to revert back to middleman when
the latter uttered a spluttering shout

  standing knee-deep in the mass of
slimy silt his expansive body streaked
and plastered with green scum both
pudgy hands holding aloft an oblong
mud-covered yellow object he pre-
sented a picture that baffled human de-
scription

  as the bedaubed president lumbered
up the slope he encountered windy
tuttle and the stranger coming from
the clump of bushes both men were
holding their hands in position to suit
the attitude of hemmerson scanlon
and krause who followed with drawn
guns

  the stranger slouched along sul-
lenly windy moved with a swagger
when he recognized middleman he guf-
fawed

  momin middleman he drawled

  the president stared hard at the quin-
tette

  rwhat seems to be your trouble
middleman grinned hemmerson

  my trouble oh hello sheriff
responded the president after another
searching look at the five why-
ahem-no trouble at all come to think
it over i wouldnt have missed that
shooting entertainment for the world
i happened to land where the stolen
ingots are cached

  the stranger glared malevolently at
windy who chuckled in an idiotic man-
ner

  what is the meaning of all this wild
west parade demanded middleman

  before an answer could be given bar-
neys first shot rang out the detective
started up the bank to investigate
hemmerson turned his prisoners over
to scanlon and the president and
started to follow echoes of two more
shots galvanized him into a run which
increased when emily screamed

  she had not screamed because of per-
sonal danger the cry was involuntary
when she recognized barney hem-
merson outdistancing the detectives
was treated to an unusual sight

  emily knowing that barneys condi-
tion was critical glanced around for
some one to help her one glimpse of
the retreating mob brought her to her
feet in a fury

  you you you devil-fostered
cowards she hurled at them lacking
epithets more fitting to their kind

  you spud foley-come here-this
instant she demanded of the nearest
man

  out came her revolver when he hesi-
tated

  come now cut away this rope
quick

  and the hulking miner obeyed as a
whipped dog might grovel at her feet

  his companions had paused to watch
but when the revolver flashed in her
hand and hemmerson came running
many began to slink away

  dont a man of you dare leave
shrilled emily noting the movement
come here donkey jack you too
dead rock and blackie-help foley
cany this poor boy to the house be
careful lift him easy if one of you
cowardly brutes hurt him one bit more
ill shoot and shoot to kill

  though humbled as ruffians ofttimes
are by the mere presence of a woman
emilys well-known skill with rifle and
revolver had much to do with their
obedience far different was that mot-
ley procession of crestfallen sobering
miners from the cursing liquor-crazed
bullies who less than twenty minutes
previous were defying law and justice
to promote their fancied vengeance

  emily kept close to barneys side
at the cabin door she ran ahead to pre-
pare her fathers room but stopped
short in the doorway of his bedroom
her father lay in his own bed

  with quick presence of mind she
vanishing gold



jerked the door to and led the way to
her own room when barney still un-
conscious was laid in her own dainty
bed she wheeled to those who were
crowding the kitchen

  let me see how fast you would-be
assassins can bring a doctor here she
cried

  the room cleared in a twinkling as
the less morbid ones vied with each
other in an effort to be first to obey
the last man shut out she hastened
to build a fire a call of oh emmy
took her from this task to find barney
sitting up in bed poking one finger
through his blood-caked hair in lieu of
the customary pencil

  oh barney dear you must not
do-

  is your-is he safe interposed
barney anxiety plain in his eyes

  she nodded and gestured for silence

  you must lie still dear til have
warm water soon to bathe your poor
head-m

  never mind me he protested
thrilled nevertheless by her term of
endearment he needs a doctor and
you at once hes in a mighty bad
fix-hurt i mean

  emily uttered a pitying cry and
darted for her fathers room only to
be interrupted by hemmerson who had
entered the kitchen unnoticed

  miss carson i dont aim to bother
you but please tell me if you know
where your father is hiding he asked

  she wheeled her back to the closed
door all color fled from her face as
she studied the sheriff searchingly dis-
trustful

  i have nothing to tell you she re-
plied curbing a temptation to drive
him out at the point of her revolver

  im sorry then if thats the case
my men could get him back to you
much quicker if we knew where to
look theres no trace of him any-
where however it may comfort you
to know that hes cleared from all

charges the guilty men have been
caught-

  the sheriffs explanation trailed to
silence his audience had vanished
within carsons bedroom following
he found emily kneeling by her fathers
side uttering throaty cries of pity and
affection which the semi delirious man
did not heed

  carson two ribs fractured and highly
inflamed from lack of attention was
in a critical condition in one swift
glance hemmerson read symptoms of
hunger and exposure he did not stop
to question but dashed out to fetch
medical aid without delay

chapter xiv

cix people gathered within the car-
son kitchen that evening-hem-
merson middleman scanlon barney
emily and krause carson was
asleep his injuries dressed his hunger
appeased he rested easily buoyed up
by an eagerness to hear full details con-
cerning buffalo hogans dethronement
barney and emily appeared far from
exhausted

  well scanlon you seem to be chief
unraveler of these mine troubles sup-
pose you start the story going sug-
gested hemmerson as eager as the
others to know more

  oi dont mind tellin pfwhat oi be
know in but yez must give young bar-
ney credit for pickin the right strings
for me to pull tis him that got the
idea oi only did as he told me an-
swered the foreman simply

  surprised eyes turned to barney
whose bandaged court-plastered face
was scarcely recognizable

  aw let scanlon tell the whole
thing exclaimed barney while i
may have doped out some of the ideas
i wouldnt have got anywhere without
him besides hes had the fun of bag-
ging the game and-how about emily
now-


vanishing gold

  oh hush barney let scanlon tell
what we are all aching to hear about v
interrupted emily hastily

  scanlon took out his pipe filled ita
struck a match blowing it out imme-
diately as he cast an apologetic glance
at emily dropped the pipe back into
his pocket then cleared his throat
why dont you smoke scanlon
surely you dont imagine i would ob-
ject exclaimed emily

  u twill help me to talk a bit better
-if ye are not mindin thanks

  scanlon brightened and again pro-
duced his pipe

  oive been puttin carrds and spades
together iver since mommy he con-
tinued when the pipe was going good
an oill do the best oi can at tellin
yez about thim maybe oid better be-
gin with the slide iverybody remem-
bers that exceptin barney who came
since then

  buffalo hogan were super with the
divits own luck at gambling bart he
were only shift boss but he couldnt
kape his fingers off the carrds oive
watched him play for years an n iver
a thing did he win but abuse an harrd
luck an on top av bein a bum gam-
bler bart were too good-natured an
willin to accommodate an it were not
long afore buffalo had him tight under
his thumb-jist as he got bud hardy
an windy tuttle an jim kerr him
pfwhat come back a week ago callin
himself knucker an many another
poor divil besides

  buffalo were playin a long-winded
game to get the mine away from the
molta company he kept complainin
that the ore were failin and that the
veins were playin out as oi remem-
ber he were mighty anxious to kape
all crews out av the west drifts hardy
an the rest played to his hand ready
enough but bart began to wake up

  bart yez may know were not a bit
crooked at heart but buffalo played
him foul by layin a couple of sneaky

traps an belavin that he were doin
a square favor bart stepped into them
all unsuspectin after that buffalo jist
tells him to either obey orders or go
to the pen for pfwhat he had done
bart the poor divil saw his fix but
he didnt have an out

  ivery onct in a while there were
slides in the west drifts an when they
happened buffalo orders all the crews
to the east levels it were kerr that
caused the slide in b level stope an
by buffalos orders thats the time
hogan made the first mistake that
tripped him he niver told bart pfwhat
were to come off an bart not know-
in rushed his hull crew into the stope
with timber when the alarrm sounded
he were goin himself for more timber
when she went in

  how the divil kerr iver got out
alive an unbeknownst to anny one oi
dont know an now hes too dead to
tell us annyway bart an hogan had
a big row buffalos quittin were only
a bluff to make bart super so as to
kape him quiet ye see bart were
ready to fess up an take his medicine
but at the time emmys mother were
a mighty sick woman so he kept still
for her sake-

  but scanlon poor mamma never
knew papa was to blame interrupted
emily

  that be jist the ray son he kept mum
about it-to kape her from havin to
die with bad sorrow in her soul ex-
plained scanlon gently

  ye see he continued bart took
the super job smilinlike but for five
years he tried his best to break ho-
gans grip it didnt take buffalo long
to see that things were not goin the
way he planned so he schemed to get
rid av bart for good an all

  when the scheme began to worrk
bart were quick to suspicion hardy an
tuttle he werent quite positive but
to make sure he fired hardy the first
vanishing gold



chance he had then trouble buzzed
thickern bees on a honey thafe

  bud hardy did all he could to stir
up hard feelings agin bart around the
mine an town an buffalo played a
cats-paw game av pizenin the com-
panys mind scanlon bent a meaning
look upon middleman who fidgeted and
mopped his face energetically

  you cant blame me exactly grum-
bled the president with half the
prominent men of molta reporting car-
sons trickery and incompetence and
the output dropping worse and worse
each year how was i to know it was
not his fault

   tis not for me to say replied
scanlon dryly annyhow knowin
different oill not argue the pint

  as oi were telling buffalo played
to get bart out an knucker in his
gang tried their best to have bart kilt
by accident when that failed to work
buffalo decided to fix a trap that bart
would fall into an hang himself

  he planned the scheme out in secret
with hardy an tuttle then he went
to bart an declared he would call all
bets off for the sake av one last favor
bart pretended to give in an hogan
told him to tip off the next big clean-up
the night before it were shipped

  right theres pfwhere buffalo ho-
gans puddin began to scorch he were
so sure av himself he niver figgered
that bart intended to tip off the ship-
ment to him an warn the messingers
at the same time neither did buffalo
figger hed be double-crossed by tuttle
on the show-down an neither did
windy have sabe enough to do anny
double-crossin till his pardner butted
in

  ye see this pardner were a combi-
nation peddler an thafe stealin for a
livin an peddlin to kape out av jail
one day he were tryin to sell barney
some av his gimcracks an had them
spread all over the desk when he
picked them up he happened to catch

the rayflection av the combination on
the surface av his junk

  next day he had a long talk with
windy then the pair av them planned
to tap a clean-up themselves it wertr
an easy trick to do windy knew that
buffalo had a secret drift runnin from
old a level to that clump av bushes
on the orroyo bank nary a soul iver
spotted the entrance for the way it were
covered

  annyway them two crooks tunneled
from this drift to the assay house an
rigged up one av the slickest contrap-
tions yez iver saw under the closet floor
they could raise and lower safe floor
an all wheniver they felt like it not
satisfied with that they tried to make
it look like bart did the trick knowin
the feelin agin him the two av them
run their tunnel all the way to carsons
cabin cornin to the surface right under
the pantry cooler

  now yez can understand how come
bart to disappear so strange like the
night hemmerson had him cornered
the cooler were not nailed tight an
havin no support with the dirt gone
below it broke loose when bart crawled
into it an dropped him right into
windys tunnel

  then old pap here roiled up the
mess still more because av a queer
streak he took the night the gold dis-
appeared  cyanide saw him swipe bar-
neys gun from the saddle jist afore
barney started for town an it were
windy an his pardner that caught pap
in the very act av shootin at carsons
back when they were gettin ready for
their own trick

  they were scared when the light
went out so they took the gun away
from pap an snuck up to see if bart
were kilt when they saw him slip
out to look around they hustled into
the tunnel an did their job av stealing
cyanide heard their racket an opened
the closet jist as the safe were hoisted
back to its place


vanishing gold

  the two thaves then hid the ingots
under old paps cabin not know in that
pap were lookin on then what does
pap do but carry ivery last ingot back
an dump them in the pool unbeknownst
to annybody but cyanide

  cyanide were kapin an eye on the
game because he had overheard windy
an the peddler plottin the scheme in
the first place an when he saw how
slick old paps crazy whim were spikin
the steal he tried to pull down a stake
for himself without gettin annybody in
a jam

  yez can easy see pwfhere bart
boosted windys chance by firin the
lusher for bootleggin licker to the
crews the next slip av the cogs were
when bart got notice from middleman
that he were fired himself his sneak-
in enemies had been naggin him so
long that he were all out av patience he
were gettin that upset he imagined bar-
ney were with the others in tryin to
down him he went into high tantrums
over the notice from middleman an
forgettin that he had tipped hogan the
word afore the shot he struck out for
frisco to have a final understands
with middleman

  buffalo had bud hardy and windy
tuttle primed to hold up the momin
stage from the mine an the two scamps
were hangin around town all night
hardy happened to see bart crossin
the freight yards on his way to the
depot an to square his own grievance
he knocked him out with a club took
iverything he had even his clothes then
chucked his body on a northbound
freight barts clothes go to windy
who hides them in paps cabin while
hardy takes all the rest to hogan

  in the morning bud and windy hike
for the narrows with orders from
buffalo to leave barts note as evidence
after the holdup windy the old fox
goes through it all innocentlike an gets
jist as howlin mad as bud when they
dont find anny gold on the stage

  then when they take the news to
hogan there were a grand failin out
among thaves buffalo raved like a
maniac an swore hed been double-
crossed by iverybody after the row
bud got sore an talked-too much for
which hogan shoots him with barts
gun an sticks barts watch in hardys
hand sos to get bart out av the way
for good

  then up steps barney to solve the
to the hull riddle there werent
another way under the sun to make
buffalo talk except that fortune-tellin
stuff an yez missed the time av your
ives by not sein how clever them show
folks did it

  then it was the stolen gold that
windy wanted when he tried to choke
old pap put in barney when scanlon
paused long enough to start his pipe
afresh

   twas that answered scanlon
testing the pipes draft with a few pre-
liminary puffs

  oive heard some speedy talkers in
my day he resumed but that little
show woman could spake fastern a
burleigh drill runnin full pressure
she took to barneys scheme for bustin
hogan like a fly to butter but she were
for doin the trick her own way-an
she did

  she had that hull bunch av flint-
headed miners a guessin all through her
act she were blindfolded while one
av the professors called for anny kind
av a question an the byes were puttin
them over fast

  one feller asks pfwhere do oi go
from here an says she yez are goin
to zee mees-tare hoo-gans to play zee
carrds an yez are goin to be var-ee
lucky then says she real solemnlike
oi can see a letter on a table in a city
that is far away it is addressed to
mees-tare hoo-gan oi can only read
its message in the crystal at midnight
buffalo werent in the house but he got
vanishing gold



the news jist the same an swallowed
the bait pole an all

  well yez should have seen his actin
in that fortune-tellin game at the hotel
to realize pfwhat a baby he were for all
his bully-raggin he were mighty
worried over barneys threat about kill-
in him for th v were the first thing
he wanted the little woman to tell him
about

  the madame had the room all hung
with black curtains an red rugs an
snaky-lookin joolry an wooden-faced
hoodoos an a table with a big glass
marble atop av a darnin needle and
stuck on the table she made buffalo
sit on one side av the table an she on
the other then when he asked his ques-
tions she cut loose with her spooky talk

  me an the lawyer an his stiney-
grafter were hid behind the curtain
back av buffalos chair but we could
peek through holes an watch the hull
show by golly tis me that thinks
buffalo suffered the tortures av hell
while the little madame were tellin
him the stuff she said the gods were
lettin her see

  says she a spirit has asked me
for permission to spake to yez mees-
tare hoo-gan buffalo looked shaky
but he nodded his head an the face av
peters without annybody appears on
the curtain behind the madame an
gives buffalo a bawlin out for killin
him

  hogan were upset bad but held onto
himself till pap stuck his own whiskers
in the curtain an spoke a piece then
the big bully wilted but he didnt do
no talkin till poor canbys spirit
showed on the curtain then he went
to his knees bawlin and beggin like a
baby

  he offered her all kinds av money
to save his soul for him askin her to
have peters an canby an the rest for-
give him but she pretends to be spakin
in a trance until she had pulled the hull
story from his ugly heart then she

tells him that to save his soul he must
first square himself with an honest con-
fession-

  scanlon ceased speaking and leaned
over to tap out the heel of his pipe in
the hearth pan of the stove

  and what did hogan do after that
asked barney breathless with interest

  well to my mind he wasted some
good powder an lead on himself but
i reckon the states been saved the ex-
pense av a justified hangin 

  did he-is he dead  breathed em-
ily her eyes widening in horror

  scanlon looked toward hemmerson

  yes answered the sheriff hogan
went direct to the saloon and locked
himself in his room he died by his
own hand and gun ten minutes before
i got there with my warrant

chapter xv

there is just one more point i am
curious about declared middle-
man as the party made a motion to
break up who drained the arroyo
pool was it any one who knew the
bars were hidden in it

  krause showed no memory or inter-
est emily and the sheriff exchanged
puzzled looks scanlon squinted wisely
at barney

  im guilty of that confessed bar-
ney and if you wont condemn me
for eavesdropping ill explain how

  to all appearances young man i
am not qualified to condemn anybody
in this case replied middleman not
unkindly a note of sadness in his tone

  well i was in my bedroom when
sutter put his twenty-thousand-dollar
offer to you afterward i crawled out
through a window and headed for paps
cabin with sutters words buzzing in
my ears he told you the gold was
hidden where no one could spot it and
when i passed the pool it occurred to
me that water had a surface which left
no marks over anything it covered


vanishing gold

  after i got back from molta last
night i had to do something to keep
awake so i cut a channel through the
gravel bar and drained the pool it
was almost daylight by the time i let
the water out and the lynchers were
getting busy so i discontinued my
search until later in the meantime you
have been lucky enough to find the in-
gots yourself concluded barney with
a droll smile

  middleman did not return the smile
then it seems that in my stupid
ignorance and misinformation i have
discharged a valuable superintendent
and an extraordinarily bright young as-
sayer i wonder if it is too late to re-
verse my decision especially if i an-
nounce that each position will command
a thousand dollars more per year 
middlemans look added weight to
his words as he ent a quizzical glance
upon barney

  before i answer for myself let me
ask what sutter did-do i get the re-
ward you have advertised for the re-
turn of the gold inquired barney

  to be sure you do  responded mid-
dleman heartily

  very well please make your check
payable for that amount to the three

marvels-

  jist a minute lad interrupted
scanlon extending to barney a roll of
bills here be the money yez gave them
show people they refused to accept it
they refused to take a cent for showin
up the dirty murderin robber

  barney eyed the money meditatively
did that slide make any widows
he asked at length

  six-an one av them be dead now
answered scanlon

  then mister middleman just make
five checks of a thousand dollars apiece
and payable to each of the five widows
that will satisfy me as for staying
on my job-he stole a furtive glance
at emily-i prefer to wait until-un-
til carson gives his answer

  hemmerson went out with the presi-
dent followed by scanlon and krause
barney would have gone too but em-
ily detained him with a question about
her father

  how did you come to find him-
and why were you wearing his clothes 
i found him in the mine the re-
ports in town had it that he was hidden
there so when i drained the pool i
started out to hunt him the night he
disappeared through the pantry is when
i discovered the secret tunnel and i
got into the mine through it he was
all in and delirious when i found him
and i packed him on my back as far
as the pantry trap then hoisted him
up with your clothes line

  after i got him to bed the propo-
sition of getting a doctor bothered me
i was afraid to leave him alone until
i caught the idea of disguising myself
in his clothes in that way i fancied i
could make a dash for help and lure
the mob out of harms way at the same
time i was trying to figure out some
means of disguising my face and hair
when two shots were fired then came
a lot of yelling in front of the cabin
i grabbed your fathers automatic and
looked out the back door in hopes of
getting the deputies to help but the
gang saw me first and-well you know
the rest

  emily toyed with her fingers in si-
lence without looking up barney failed
to interpret the sign he sighed his
weariness both of heart and body he
wished she would say a word in de-
fense of his act but she didnt and
he reopened the door

  are you coming to breakfast in the
morning

  very likely answered barney from
the back porch

  and-barney

  her finger went to her teeth he
paused on the lower step with down-
cast eyes

  you have kept your word-are you
vanishing gold



going- to be unkind just because i wish	you are awful dense for a man who

to keep my word too 	has just made such brilliant discoveries

    if ive been unkind forgive me	must i tel you again that when you

you have a perfect right to keep your proved papa absolutely innocent-

word responded barney sadly as he	she could not say more a bandaged

stepped to the path	face bent over her own her lips were

  goodness barney petulantly	sealed

the return

john raymer was weary the day at the office had dragged leaving
him too much time for thoughts that turned again and again to his deserted
home more than two months had passed since sylvia had gone leaving only
a brief note to tell him that she was going back to her mothers home because
she felt that he was too much absorbed in his business to need her to raymer
the accusation had seemed unjust his pride too prevented him from offering
explanations or excuses and so he had merely written that she must decide for
herself though a welcome awaited her whenever she chose to return at first
he had missed her happy light-hearted ways but by constant effort had learned
to check in their first onrush the horde of dismal thoughts that sometimes
attacked him to-day however a strange brooding influence seemed to numb
all his faculties and he had come home depressed

    he tried to read he tried to write and once he decided to go to the theater
but as he pictured himself alone in the throng of pleasure seekers he shrank from
the thought and after wandering aimlessly about the house finally seated himself
on the veranda where he remained until long after the moon had risen

    how often he and sylvia had sat there looking out upon the moonlit scene
and peopling it with fairies but now the shadows looked weird and lonely and
the fitful swaying of the trees in the soft summer wind wove grotesque patterns
of light and shade upon the grass he tried to shake off the sense of oppression
but seemed powerless even to move and yielded to the drowsiness stealing over
him then in a whisper faint but distinct he heard sylvias voice calling
john john and clad in soft misty garments she floated before him

    he started forward then sank back in his chair not knowing whether the
vision of sylvia had been a dream or a part of his waking consciousness dazed
and motionless he listened as the old clock in the hall with slow measured
strokes like the tolling of a bell proclaimed the hour as the last tone died
away raymer spoke twelve

    the sound of his own voice broke the spell and rising from his chair he
strode toward his room with determined step and went to bed

    when he wakened the next morning the sunlight was streaming in at the
window and he lost no time in dressing for his day at the office

    as he approached the breakfast table he saw in staring black letters upon
a yellow envelope lying beside his plate the fateful word telegram with
trembling fingers he opened it and read

    sylvia passed away at midnight calling for you
the bibulous

the strangest event in my life
happened last summer said my
traveling companion i have
only nentured to tell this story to my
wife and brother it is so unique and
apparently so beyond human belief that
if i published it broadcast i would be
looked upon by the world as an im-
postor of the first water

  and did your wife and brother be-
lieve you i asked

  well not exactly yes and no
they believed that i thought i was
telling the truth the one imagined
that the tale sprang from the effects
of strong drink the other blamed the
strength of the summer sun but i
assure you it was neither i had had
a few glasses of absinth certainly but
i have been accustomed to this drink
since childhood the sun indeed was
very hot but it was as nothing com-
pared to the heat i have experienced
in the tropics

  the story doctor i ventured
ah said he you will laugh but
nevertheless i will give it to you mirth
is the reward one gets from the world

when one gives something new to it
people laugh entirely too much and
smile only with their lips look into
a mans eyes-they alone are the true
mirrors of emotion

  on the fifteenth of last august i
was living at a seaside resort not far
from the city it was the warmest day
of the summer and the people had
taken to the water sitting on the
veranda of the hotel with a glass of
absinth on the arm of my chair i could
see the blue expanse of ocean stretch-
ing out from the beach like a velvet
rug lying on a floor of whitest marble
not a breath of air ruffled that placid
surface not a wrinkle of thought
rested on the calm forehead of the sea
and above it the sun hung stationary
in the heavens resembling an open
porthole of a burning ship seen
through the blue haze of evening

  on the beach men and women were
running about caricaturing by their
grotesque awkward movements the
play of children as grown people do
when they attempt to cheat father
time in the water round objects
the bibulous baby



could be seen bobbing up and down
like pieces of cork and it seemed
strange that these little globes should
be moving about guided by the brains
that they contained and stranger still
that if one should suddenly sink out
of sight for several moments a great
excitement would turn these shouts of
laughter into screams these movements
of animal joy into gesticulations of
horror

  sitting all alone on that hotel
veranda i continued to sip my absinth
and to meditate on the scene before me
suddenly i saw a very pretty young
girl approaching pushing a baby car-
riage before her the child was evi-
dently sleeping and was concealed un-
der a canopy of mosquito netting the
girl looked longingly out to sea while
two lines of irritation furrowed her
forehead

  acting on a sudden impulse i spoke
to her youll pardon me but couldnt
i be of some assistance i see that
you like bathing and its quite a won-
derful day for it i could take care
of the baby while you have a plunge

  she hesitated and again looked out
to sea tm very much obliged she
began but mother told me to take care
of-at this she hesitated and i
thought i saw her face darken-of my
little brother she finished

   but i could take care of him for
a time he wont be any trouble hes
fast asleep

   yes he is asleep she said lifting
the mosquito netting and looking down
at the little red face lying on the lace
pillow thank you so much i think i
will go in bathing and wheeling the
baby carriage up beside me she turned
and hurried off toward the bath houses
on the shore

  again my eyes returned to the
bathers and my hand lifted the glass
of absinth to my lips how black and
tiny some of the heads looked far out
on the water here in this bathtub

of the city life was a precious thing
yet there was an abundance of it a
superfluity of it i had been in thinly
populated countries where it was not
thought of so highly

   i beg your pardon sir said a
voice bfeside me which sounded like a
key turning in a rusty lock but im
very thirsty and absinth is my favorite
drink

  i turned about in surprise and was
thunderstruck to see that  was appar-
ently still alone no one stood back
of my chair no one was behind the
pillar on my right and no one crouched
behind the baby carriage as i had first
suspected but as i stared about me
the voice again spoke in its strange
quavering tones

   lift up the mosquito net over the
carriage it said its damnably hot
in here

  almost mechanically i did as i was
told and in a moment more was look-
ing down into the little red wrinkled
face of a baby as i gazed at the
shapeless nose at the bald head and
loose-lipped mouth the eyes opened
and looked up at me what i felt then
you can never imagine my friend i
cannot describe it to you i can only
say that it was horrible-horrible past
belief i had expected the frightened
innocent stare of awakened childhood
in place of it i saw the vicious know-
ing leer of wicked old age with a
cry of horror i reeled back and put
my hands before my eyes

   well said the voice again and
now i knew that it too was old-as
old as an echo in a haunted house
well my young friend do i get a
taste of your absinth or not

   what are you  i cried as soon
as i could speak

   young man said the baby squint-
ing evilly at me over his blanket im
about the dryest child in the world
do you know what ive been getting
to drink lately ive been getting milk
o

the bibulous baby

--milk from a dirty blue-nosed bottle
everybody takes advantage of me be-
cause im too old to kick up a disturb-
ance why my own grandchild-the
one who was wheeling me just now-
takes advantage of me family pride
is all very well but what is getting me
is ive only got four more weeks to
live and i might as well be a live one
till the very end

   just a moment said i taking a
long drink of absinth to steady my
nerves now you can tell me every-
thing you may unburden yourself to
me as though i were your father
well he snarled if i tell you
the story will you empty the milk out
of my bottle and fill it up with ab-
sinth v

   yes readily i answered
a so im selling my family pride for
a bottle of absinth said he well
no matter here it goes my grand-
father owned a large plantation before
the war like many another southern
gentleman of that time he preferred
the joys of the body to the joys of the
spirit wine in plenty women in
plenty tobacco in plenty-that was his
idea of life but there was one thing
that worried my grandfather

   what was that  i asked

   old age said the baby solemnly
it was his one fear and when it
finally came-when gout laid hold of
his feet and time pulled out his hair
-he was a pitiful object to behold
lying on his back he cursed life and
said that it started from the wrong
end that if men were bom old and
grew younger year by year then theyd
have something to live for instead of
cursing every day that came and on
the night when he died he sold his soul
to the devil or so my old negro nurse
used to say on the following morn-
ing i was born

   and how long ago was that my
little friend i asked

   eighty-five years ago last decem-

ber said the baby of course i cant
remember as far back as that my
first recollection is of standing before
the mirror while my mother combed
out my long gray beard yes i had
a beard then and they say it was snow
white when i was bom but when i
remember it first it was gray-a beauti-
ful silver gray that was a long time
ago and i wish i had one now

   and yet even then i wasnt happy
id try to get the old men in the village
interested in blindmans buff and tag
but they wouldnt play with me and i
felt lonely people began to talk when
they saw me rolling my hoop in the
street or playing marbles with the boys
so mother had to tell them that i was
an uncle of hers in his second childhood
fearing that they might guess the truth
sometimes the old men would beckon
me into the tavern buy me some ab-
sinth and when i had drunk it send
me home tottering on my feet

   and so time passed gradually i
grew taller and stronger the gray
began to fade out of my beard in
patches and mother was now thought
by strangers to be my sister i no
longer played marbles with the boys
or rolled my hoop along the pavement
no now the girls whom i met on the
street would make my heart beat all
out of tune but they never looked
at me or if they did they would say
he is old enough to be our father
and pass by but there was one who
said what young eyes he has i
married that girl and settled down with
the optimistic belief that nothing could
shatter my happiness

   but the years went by and each
one that passed made me younger and
my dear wife older finally we met
on the tide of life each drifting toward
a separate goal and we could not
hold each other we passed by swiftly
unable even to clasp hands i must
have suffered then yet my hair lost
all its gray i was growing to be a com-
the bibulous baby

paratively young man and i had chil-
dren and they soon grew older than i
and they had children and they grew
older than i-till now all that is left
me is a taste for absinth the taste
that i acquired when the old men used
to send me home from the tavern in
the days of my drunken gray-haired
childhood how i used to ciy when
they wouldnt play marbles with me

   ah well ah well now im eighty-
five and a baby with the tastes of an
old man yet they wont give me my
absinth and expect me to say nothing
about myself because of family pride
it seems i am a monster-something
to be hidden away in a perambulator
ah but the ladies give me privileges
sometimes which theyd scarcely give if



they knew my age i have four more
weeks of life how do i know why
the doctor of the hotel examined me
this morning and said that i am just
four weeks old but give me your ab-
sinth sir dont take advantage of
me because i am old and helpless 
and did you give him your ab-
sinth i asked

  yes said my friend i filled his
milk bottle with it he was so weak
that i had actually to put the nipple in
his mouth then i went up to my
room leaving him sucking peacefully
four weeks later i read his death no-
tice in the paper well what do you
think of that sir

  i think it is quite remarkable i
answered

the innocence of sin

they met at the salon of madame irudell where gathered intellects with-
out hearts bodies without souls but her eyes were clear and blue and
innocent and she talked of flowers-while he possessed a brow of saintly
mold fingers long and clean and fine and his hobby was the exploration of ancient
monasteries

    as he bowed over her hand his glance took in the rich fullness of her neck
and bosom and he inwardly exclaimed in anticipation her eyelids drooped
letting their interested gaze linger on the creaseless front of his waistcoat

    two hours later they were alone in the shadowy conservatory seated beneath
a dwarfish upas tree her head was on his shoulder one soft arm about his
neck the virginlike lips met his in an ecstasy of triumph as he held her to him
his fingers gently stroking the back of her hair

    there was silence each seemed under the spell of some immediate crisis

    how easy he said to himself as he unloosened her emerald dog collar

    men never outgrow the need of a nurse she thought as she slipped the
diamond-studded watch from his waistcoat pocket

atb
the seventh
glass

it was very nice and clean in the con-
valescent ward of the hospital
where max zabem sat the beds
were clean and the floor was clean
scrubbed to a spick-and-span neatness
by the hands of the hospital women
and the nurses were clean-those sure
positive yet gentle nurses the doc-
tors were clean and their instruments
displayed a glistening cleanliness be-
yond criticism max had noticed all
along the clean food on clean dishes
so unlike the food of the trenches
and even the sunshine which came
through the windows was clean there
was a very smell of cleanness in the
air so it was very pleasant there in
the convalescent ward even though one
had lost a piece of a hand

  in fact that made it pleasanter still
in a rather odd sort of way it meant
that a man would not need to go back
to the trenches the dugouts the slattern
food the roar of guns the constant
peril by day and night the icy mud of
winter or the choking hot dust of sum-
mer it meant an end of all that-those
things of which max zabem had grown
woefully weary deathly sick before a
bit of grenade had tom away half of
his hand and so sent him to be healed
in body and somewhat in spirit in thi

clean different place where womens
voices in sympathy or direction had
taken the place of an oberofficers gruff
and ofttimes brutal commands

  the dressing hour was past max
lifted his bandaged member and in-
spected it through the faint haze of
the pipe he was smoking the bandage
was clean too it had been put on
less than thirty minutes ago and the
surgeon doctor had pronounced his
wound practically well that meant
that he would soon be discharged and
then he would go home

  home a rather far-away light
crept into max zaberns blue eyes at
the thought that leaped into his brain

yes he would go home and- gott

that would be good  his slightly wid-
ened pupils seemed to see the little vil-
lage where he had been born and raised
and had grown to manhood he saw
the homely houses the little fields the
wooded slopes of the alsatian hills
he nodded as he smoked ach gott
it would be good to go home-down
there where it was quiet-away from
the thunder of the guns not but what
he had been willing enough to do his
share in the war he was not a cow-
ard when the war came he had laid
down his hammer in the little smithy
the seventh glass

which was his had untied his apron
of hide and hung it on a peg and shoul-
dering his rifle had marched away quite
as a matter of course-quite as he had
always known he would if war should
come it was a part of a germans
duty-to fight for the fatherland-part
of the citizenship which was his it
was something to be accepted just as
one accepted the sunlight the day and
the night birth life death when those
things came to one too

  but that was over death had struck
close to him yet passed him by he
was unfit now to serve the fatherland
in the trenches hence there was no rea-
son why he should not go home and
become one of those who kept things
moving back of the lines the badge
of his crippled hand would show that
he had served he would go home and
open the smithy and put on his apron
again he had seen his hand as the
surgeon dressed it it would suffice
for a good deal he could still work
only-a little frown came up between
his eyes-it would not be quite the same
after all down there because although
max had gone first his father had gone
later and had fallen in the very first
trench into which he had been sent
and-his mother the alsatian woman
who had never been quite all german
like husband and son had been had
died during the two years since max
had untied his apron and marched
away

  marie had written him about that-
marie cirey who lived with her old
mother on the outskirts of the village
she had written to say his mother was
dead that she would take care of her
grave until he max came back that
was like marie max thought she was
a sentimental creature after one had
spent two years in killing men and see-
ing them killed and burned rather than
buried or rolled like cholera-stricken
hogs into trenches and covered with a
few spadefuls of earth one grave

seemed a very little to make a fuss
about but-max had known marie
ever since they had played together as
children and it was like her to put in
that about caring for a womans grave
when she wrote to that womans son
max had not shed a tear when he re-
ceived that letter death had grown
too common yet oddly enough now
he found himself wondering if marie
had wept by the grave she had tended
probably she had it would be like
her-yes

  she was a pretty thing she would
make a fine mother of children and the
fatherland was going to need many
children a slow smile grew on
zabems lips he had always liked
marie before the war so when he went
home he would see her and possibly-

  there was a slight commotion at the
end of the ward max turned his head
forsaking his daydream of the future
for the present there was a knot of
officers just inside the door stem-faced
men clad in close-fitting tunics on the
breasts of more than one of which the
iron cross showed they were speak-
ing to the nurse in charge of the ward
and now she lifted a hand pointed
directly at zabera and drew aside

  the officers advanced their heavy
feet rang loud in that place of soft-
footed quiet

  max rose to his feet startled ques-
tioning the reason for their coming and
then he stood at attention his hand
lifted to his close-cropped head in
salute

  you are max zabem the cross
of the order of merit hung beside the
cross of iron on the speakers breast

  herr fa max found his voice
well-nigh sticking in his throat

  the doctor tells me your hand is
well 

  herr ja

  good the officer turned on his
heel come we must find a place
to talk


the seventh glass

  max followed down the ward once
more one of the uniformed men ad-
dressed the nurse in charge a pri-
vate room he demanded gruffly and
moved off behind her lead

  she opened the door of a room and
the officers crowded in zabern fol-
lowed and stood waiting still at atten-
tion take him rummer said the
man who had addressed him first

  a captain trim almost dapper dark
thin-lipped with eyes which seemed to
max to search him swiftly measure
and appraise him now fixed him with
a stare

  your usefulness in the army is
ended i understand he began

  zabern lifted his bandaged hand
three fingers and a part of the bones
behind them herr he replied

  the officer nodded so i have it
already he waved the answer aside
his thin lips retracted slightly that
is the reason they give you to me
youre of no further use to them but
the intelligence service needs brains
more than hands how are your
brains 

  as good as ever herr zabern said
and suddenly he thrilled this dark
slender man with the eyes of a hawk
and the lips of scant mercy was an
agent of that service which bulwarked
the armys blind force-which learned
impossible things in impossible fashion
what could he have to say to him now
in so unexpected a way

  he was not left long in ignorance
because kummer kept up his questions
you come from alsace

  herr ja

  the captain mentioned a name it
was that of maxs own village

  once more zabern gave assent

  born there-lived there always

  herr ja

  know the people-all of them

  all who were there when i joined
my command herr

  so then said kummer since you

are no longer physically fit for a soldier
there is another way in which you can
be of use listen the damned french
are getting information from some-
where behind that sector of our line
i think its coming from your town
and its got -to be stopped i could send
a man down there but id prefer one
who knows the people-the district-
and i knew you were here and about
ready to go back well-go ahead and
when you get there find that source of
the enemys information and report it
to the nearest command

  so that was it what a wonderful
thing the intelligence service was they
had even known he was here nearly
recovered and that he was from the
village where the french had planted a
spy as it would seem that was how
the fatherland kept count of its men
that was efficiency-to use the
wounded no longer able to fight to
find out those who might be seeking to
hinder the fighters who could still fight
on and for this they had picked out
him he was not so useless after all
he could do something he squared
his shoulders to an even stiffer atten-
tion it is an order herr captain
he said

  it is an order kummer repeated
herr gottf what else find that
dirty spy

  and report to the nearest com-
mand 

  yes

  max saluted so soon as i have
my discharge he accepted

  kummer nodded that will be ar-
ranged he turned and began a low-
toned conversation with one of the offi-
cers who had come with him while
max still stood at attention and pres-
ently without so much as a glance at
zabern they all left the room clanking
out with heavy feet and a rattle of side
arms just as they had clanked in some
time before

  then and then only did max relax
the seventh glass



his rigid position in which he was be-
ginning to sway slightly because it had
been weeks since he had stood like that
he left the room and went slowly back
to his chair-where he had been sitting
when kummer and the rest had come
and sought him out

  he would go home and meet every
one he knew he would inquire casu-
ally about any newcomers any stran-
gers he would see marie and ask
her if any strange people had come
to the village since he left-and how
long since they arrived marie would
know and she would tell him of course
she was a simple thing always laugh-
ing as he remembered her in the past
and she had always been like that
max smiled now a slow smile as he
recalled how as a child when they
roamed the hills together she had sung
and danced this way and that while he
had followed more slowly more in
stolid fashion how her browned little
legs had flashed among the grass and
weeds her brown hair waved her
brown eyes glanced back at him and
her red lips smiled to-day it seemed
to max she had been like a little brown
butterfly then fluttering hither and
thither while he plodded along -and
watched he must meet her seek her
indeed to thank her for caring for his
mothers grave

  later in the day the nurse in charge
of the ward told him he had been dis-
charged he was given his clothing
his cap and coat she told him he was
to report at the nearest railway station
and make himself known that his
transportation had been arranged to his
home

  max said good-by to the nurse and
several of the men in the ward and
marched away to the station where he
found everything just as the nurse had
said that was rummers work of
course max smiled as he took a seat
in the train how everything worked
out-how everything fitted in just like

the cogs in a machine it took clever
management to bring about such perfect
system but the men at the head of
all this kriegspiel this war game were
clever what fools the other peoples
were to resist them the high com-
mand was bound to win in the end
but meanwhile there was a spy to be
caught down there where he was going
and he had been chosen to catch him
and thereby bring so much nearer the
certain victory which the high com-
mand would gain

  the railway did not pass through his
village but that did not matter to max
he was hardened to walking miles
after two years of life with haversack
and blanket roll and rifle upon his
sweating back he got down from the
train and watched it disappear then
turned along the highway at a swing-
ing stride trudging forward head up
and after a time he began to sing-one
of those marching songs he had sung
with his comrades in those first weeks
of the war when their gray-green ranks
had swept down across northern
france before von klucks flank had
been bent and edged south and east from
its encircling move toward paris and the
whole wonderful advance had stopped
lapping like a human flood against a
human bank and then drawn sullenly
back in the ebb of a human tide

  so singing at times at other times
silent he mde little of the miles until
at length he came to the crest of a hill
and gazed down on the village which
lay beyond him that was home

 home max paused and drew a
deep lung-filling breath and allowed
his eyes to rest upon the scene-the
houses nestled in the little valley pro-
tected by the wooded shoulders of the
hills on the farther side where the road
mounted again like a crooked grayish
white ribbon among the green of grow-
ing things

  many times during those first weeks
two years before he had pictured the


the seventh glass

scene to himself the heitnweh-the
home longing-had nagged him then
yet now that he stood here there seemed
no real reason why it should have been
so the village was the same it was
home he had never known another
yet it was not home really for his
father was dead and his mother also
max felt almost a stranger as he be-
gan the descent of the road to the famil-
iar place the sight of which had
brought back all that had been and was
not now and made it all horribly real
in the shock of war he had scarcely re-
alized just what it meant-was going
to mean it came to him now with an
almost crushing force he was com-
ing home but without any hope of that
welcome of which also he had thought
in those first weeks when the heitnweh
gnawed

  but his eyes traveled faster than his
feet and soon he could locate a house
set some distance back from the village
a stone house with whitewashed walls
there was a garden behind it and far-
ther back still a little wood and max
knew that back of the wood was a
meadow in front of the house he could
catch the red and white and pink of
hollyhocks growing on upstanding stalks
-like the ranks of gayly-trapped sol-
diers-just as they used to do two years
before the home of the widow cirey
and her daughter marie max quick-
ened his steps and came at last to the
house and paused a path ran in from
the road between the stiff hollyhock
stalks and a great white goose thrust-
ing its head around the comer of the
house gazed at him out of yellowish
eyes and hissed an inquiry max put
fcis feet apart and stared back he
grinned there was the spirit of the
fatherland in that goose which hissed
a challenge to the stranger who would
set foot on the soil of its home

  then while he stood there a woman
appeared one would have said she had
noted the posture of the great goose

and came to investigate the cause of his
actions she saw a man at the end of
the hollyhock rows paused for a mo-
ment while her eyes went wide with a
wondering recognition then she was
flying toward him down the path
max  max zabern she cried
well here was a welcome max
thought and he put out his uninjured
palm good day marie he said
quite as though he might have seen
her but a short time before

  marie cirey paused and placed her
hand in his what brings you back
max  she began and then caught sight
of his bandage her face altered
swiftly became solicitous in its expres-
sion oh but i see you are
wounded hurt the poor hand
part of it shot away said max
one-handed men are not fit for the
kriegspxel that is a two-handed game
marie touched the bandage tenderly
then you are back to stay she re-
turned slowly with l little warmth of
color creeping up into her cheeks
yes but now i stopped here first
the girls eyes lighted she took
hold of the strong bronzed well hand
and began pulling upon it smiling upon
him as he remembered she had always
done since a child urging him up the
path come she cried you must
go in and say good day to mother and
tell her you are back

  she will know that when she sees
me max made literal answer but he
smiled too maries touch was soft
and warm and she displayed a strong
supple figure of a woman under her
plain coarse dress

  she was still smiling and her eyes
were dancing as she continued to pull
him along between the hollyhock rows
with their white and red and pink bells
he followed her around the side of
the house to a door which gave entrance
to a room he remembered very well
there was the same old table and chairs
and a sand-scrubbed floor on one side
the seventh glass



a ladderlike stair led to a sort of loft
and in a corner a second series of steps
ran down to a storage cellar there
was a cupboard full of dishes and a
stove and between two closed doors
was a clock on a shelf

  a woman was sitting in one of the
chairs mending a stocking she was
small rather withered with wrinkled
cheeks and faded lips but a pair of
bright brown eyes shone under her neat
gray hair

  mother said marie here is max
he has lost a part of a hand and come
back

  the woman in the chair glanced up
she rose slowly one noted that she
did not stand wholly erect sit you
max she invited we are glad you
are returned and it is seldom we have
a visitor nowadays

  so said zabern sitting down
this looked like a veiy good opportun-
ity to begin his work it could not
have fallen out better then there are
few people coming and going these days
mother 

  some are going marie made the
answer the last the village can send

  and no outsiders come to it said
max

  no why should they there is
nothing for them here maries mother
returned in a quick almost staccato
voice

  there is a very pretty maiden max
rejoined in rather blundering fashion
with his eyes on maries face

  marie laughed while her color deep-
ened la they taught you to be
bold in the army didnt they my
friend

  max grinned he spent an hour tell-
ing of his life in the army before he
left to go on to the house which had
been his former home to-morrow i
shall come again he told marie at
parting and i shall want you to
show me my mothers grave

  the girl sobered on the instant her
eyes grew soft max she exclaimed
it will be lonely stay here to-night
with us

  marie said her mother max will
want to look over his peoples things-
and possibly visit his smithy you for-
get yourself in the pleasure of seeing
an old friend he will come to-morrow
again

  yes i will come max promised
and went away he felt a trifle puz-
zled that maries mother had not wanted
him to stay marie was very glad to
see him but he wasnt so sure about
her mother well after all it was
marie in whom he felt an interest the
old woman didnt really matter so
much

  he entered the village greeted a for-
mer acquaintance here and there and
came at last to his fathers house it
was empty of life but the familiar
rooms were just as they had been left
after his mother died in a way it
reminded max of some of those homes
in belgium and northern france from
which the owners had fled-homes he
had seen during the first weeks of the
war he had his supper at a neigh-
bors table and later that night went
back and crawled into the bed in which
he had slept before there had been a
war and he slept as he had learned
to sleep during the past two years in
the morning he entered his little smithy
which stood on a comer of the same
plot as his house and in the afternoon
he went to see marie

  she led him to the little burial
ground up on the side of the hill and
to a grave built around with stones
that her hands had placed until the
rectangle which they marked was more
like a bed of flowers than anything else
she knelt down beside it while max
stood her eyes were moist as she
raised them to his she wanted so
much to see you she said and all
i could do was to promise her to write


the seventh glass

and tell you the best way i could it

was this dreadful war killed her max
zabem nodded gaviss he said
i know she never could forget the
time when alsace belonged to france
though then she was but a child she
loved france more than the fatherland
i am afraid

  marie shook her head but she
loved you and your father more
again max nodded his head it
was very good of you to tend the grave
marie he mumbled

  good marie rose could i do
less for her my friend for a woman
of alsace

  for the third time max nodded
ach yes that is so he said

  they turned away leaving the little
burial ground to its quietness and after
walking a little way seated themselves
on the side of the hill where they could
look down on the village tell me
said marie how the war really goes
are you still winning max

  yes of course zabem replied
marie laughed but you havent
won yet

  no not yet max shook his head
but when verdun falls

  when verdun falls marie drew
back her red lips showing her firm
white teeth

  max frowned i was forgetting
he said you are like my mother
your mother too cannot forget when
alsace belonged to france blit-such
talk is forbidden marie she was
just as she always had been he thought
always laughing always teasing

 forbidden why max her
hand fell on his what have i said
except what you said before me

  it wasnt what you said but the
way you said it he replied

  i jested of course marie caught
her breath and turned her face away
she was somewhat pale as she sat star-
ing off across the valley

  max watched her it is not well to

jest about such things he said in a
voice which had grown a trifle thick
but let that pass you are like your
mother and my mother too it would
seem but-could you be still more like
my mother was when she was young
like you-could you love a german
marie

  very slowly she turned her head and
her lips smiled softly being your
mothers son you are only half ger-
man she teased

  so max accepted well yes
that is true but i am one who has
given his service to the fatherland as
no one can question as my wife you
would be safer-no one would question
you then

  question me the girls eyes wid-
ened swiftly why what do you
mean 

  nothing said max and told the
truth he had meant merely that as
the wife of one who had served she
would be in a position assured so
then will you be my wife we have
known one another since we were chil-
dren will you be my wife marie
hot color dyed her cheeks she
bowed her head

  marie he urged
ulch liebe dick she faltered hardly
above a whisper and flung up her head
and turned her face to his oh max
i never knew you cared

  max told her the truth i did not
know it myself until i knew i was com-
ing home well then when shall it be
my hand will not keep me long from
work

  marie considered after the war
she decided at last

  himmel zabem grunted after
the war why not now

  marie met the question smiling oh
now mein lieber there are things about
which we would not agree

  far over the hills beyond the valley
appeared a number of dots they
looked like a covey of birds at that
the seventh glass



distance but they came rapidly and
swam above the valley crossed it and
passed above man and girl with a rat-
tle of whirring motors to flit down
the afternoon sky toward the west

  fokkers said max coming from
strasbourg likely

  marie nodded they pass here all
the time

 how far are the nearest enemy
lines max inquired

  about sixteen or twenty kilometers
quite often one may hear the sound of
the guns

 so as close as that max
scrambled up and helped her rise he
was not at all displeased with the after-
noon one really relished the apple one
climbed for the most and he had made
good progress for the first day home
he looked at the girl with an almost
proprietary glance as they turned back
toward the village if it had not been
for the mission on which kummer had
sent him he would have been quite
happy in a stolid sort of way

  but that mission was something not
to be forgotten or delayed and since
marie seemed to have failed him as a
source of information it appeared nec-
essary to find another if he could he
went with her to her home watched her
flit up the path between the hollyhocks
turn to toss him a smile and vanish into
the house he went back to the village
and renewed some of the acquaintances
of two years ago

  though he questioned as casually as
he could careful always not to appear
too anxious he was unable to learn
of any one unvouched for about the
region and made his way back to his
home in a state bordering on disgust
he lay awake for a long time that night
after he had retired turning the thing
in his brain and after a time he thought
that perhaps he was coming to under-
stand the fokkers which had flown
over the valley that afternoon first put
the thing in his mind kummer had

said the information was going out
from back of this sector of the line
hence if there was no one here who
might be suspected of sending it then
the spy might be somewhere else in the
region if fokkers could fly west allied
air craft could fly east they might
even do so at times to meet their man
and return with what he had learned
and-they would probably do that at
night

  therefore max formed a plan and
put it into operation making his hand
the excuse for not opening his smithy
as yet he began to take long marches
about the district always on the watch
yet always ready to stop and chat with
any one he met on the chance that some
dropped remark might give him the
clew to the person he sought he found
and made himself known to the near-
est garrison back of the lines but he
did not find the source of the informa-
tion which kummer had said was leak-
ing out

  on two evenings of the week follow-
ing his return he went to marie cireys
home and sat talking to the girl and her
mother marie was frankly glad to see
him and their position of man and
sweetheart leaped rather than grew into
an accepted fact now that it had found
expression in words as it had that after-
noon on the hill by the burial ground
when the fokkers flew over their heads
and on into the west marie laughed
at him teased him was always finding
some excuse to touch him with her
hands and the second night she fol-
lowed him outside and kissed him be-
fore he went away yes marie was
very glad to have him come

  but as regarded madame cirey max
wasnt so sure of his welcome more
than once he found the older woman
watching him out of her sharp brown
eyes above her work indeed it seemed
to max that she regarded him at times
almost with a suspicion which she never
expressed in words it was as though
go

the seventh glass

she was asking herself some question
about him not yet decided in her mind
it rather puzzled him if he let himself
think about it for she had never
seemed so distant in the past when
he had come to her home or when as
an awkward somewhat bashful youth
he came to see marie then she had
always appeared as glad to see him
and now she seemed actually ill at ease
because of his presence max thought
it rather odd

  still-he had more important things
to think about he was failing in the
work to which he had been assigned
he pondered it again that night as he
trudged home with maries kiss warm
on his lips he had meant to be clever
but he had done nothing and the
thought annoyed him he frowned
then stopped where he was and his
frown relaxed kummer had selected
him had said the information was go-
ing out from his part of the region
kummer must have had some sort of
rather definite knowledge therefore
if there were no strangers to be learned
about there was only one other con-
clusion to be reached and max reached
it by a slow and sure process some-
body not a stranger was sending the
enemy word and since kummer had
sent him here kummer must think it
was here he was needed

  though stubborn somewhat stolid
zabern was not a fool he saw now
where he had gone at the whole matter
wrong even in the time of his search
he must watch not in the day time but
at night he went toward home
stopped for a moment at his nearest
neighbors then went on to his house
lighted a lamp let it bum for a few
moments and then blew it out he did
not go to bed but sat until every light
in the village was dead so far as he
could see then he slipped softly out
into the starlit night and stole not down
the street but back into the fields

  a rattle out of the air came to him

where he lay stretched upon the grass
max knew it for he had heard it many
times it was a fokker flying over it
passed and died away another came
and went max could see them dim
flitting shapes against the stars he
lay there until a faint light crept into
the east then rose regained his house
without being observed and slept late

  another night and another he
watched and on the fourth there came
a whirring out of the air but now it
was different-as different to the ears
of one who had been trained to read
it as the tones of two different pianos

  max stiffened this was not a fok-
ker the drum of its motor had a
wholly different note and suddenly
that drumming died plainly the pilot
had shut off or his engine had stalled
max lifted his head and searched the
sky for the shadowy outline of the
machine all at once he saw it dimly
sliding silently down down until it
passed below the lip of the hills and
was lost

  zabern had marked the line of the
hills where it had disappeared and
rising he set off in that direction he
passed beyond the end of the village
and then went more cautiously lest
any noise should make known his ap-
proach straining his ears for any sound
from the vanished plane

  all at once the staccato pound of a
motor suddenly sprung to life max
stopped and stood rooted to the ground
the rising whir came from beyond him
from back of the dark mass of a tiny
wood and then the aeroplane was up
above the trees shooting up and away
in a long rising slant like some great
night-buzzing beetle in its flight

  he knew now where it was the
little wood was that which stood be-
tween the meadow and the widow
cireys home and the aeroplane had
made a landing in the meadow it was
a veiy good place and that the pilot
had found it in the night showed some-
the seventh glass



thing like previous knowledge of its
existence max thought as he ran to-
ward the wood

  he soon reached it paused again
and glanced about before he entered
its deeper shadow suddenly he
crouched down seeking cover as in-
stinctively as some skulking thing of
the wild for his eyes had caught the
pin point of a light a light in the
village at two oclock in the morning
was not a usual thing and there was
only one place about here where that
light could be-a window in the little
loft of the widow cireys house it
was stationary steady the thought
flashed into zaberns brain that it could
be seen a long ways-from an aeroplane
perhaps his heart began beating
slowly his breath stuck in his throat
he turned away from the yellow ray
and sought to pierce the shadows of
the wood with his gaze

  his ears gave him warning first
something was moving among the
trees there was a soft dragging
max let himself down and lay upon
his belly as the sound approached but
he did not think in a conscious way
his mind seemed for the time a blank
-all its powers centered in the senses
of hearing and sight

  a shadow detached itself from the
background of the trees and advanced
slowly on a line which would pass just
beyond the point where he lay it was
the figure of a woman bent halfway
over so that her hands might seize and
hold some object she was pulling along
through the grass and weeds intent
on her task she glanced neither to right
nor left but seemingly down at what
she held

  half on his hands and knees like
a creeping creature more than a man
zabem followed ready to drop down
and lie flat if she should chance to
look back the way she had come

  the woman reached the cirey house
max heard the door open the noise of

her burden being dragged inside with
a soft muffled scraping then the door
was closed what might have been a
full minute passed before the light in
the window of the loft went out ab-
ruptly and the whole thing was sud-
denly as though it had never occurred

  max straightened from his crouch-
ing position and stood alone in the
night with a little breeze fanning about
him now he knew what he had been
trying to find out and as he made his
way back across the fields toward his
house he understood why marie had
questioned him in teasing fashion about
the war why when he had said she
would be beyond question as his wife
she had asked him in an almost startled
manner what he meant knowing what
she was doing she had certainly thought
for the moment that he might suspect
or might have heard something about
it in the village it was plain now too
why she had said she would marry him
after the war because before that there
would be things about which they would
not agree why madame cirey was al-
ways seemingly ill at ease when he sat
in her house at night oh yes max
understood it all now and he had to
admit it was clever in a way the fok-
kers were always flying over and the
meadow back of the woods was a
secluded spot but for the training of
his ears he might not have picked out
the different rattle of the engine of the
allied aeroplane another hearing it
would have passed it by as it came only
at night when the village slept he
must be certain and-he must think-

  he regained his house and sat down
in his unlighted room he turned the
thing over with slow logic in his brain
he must find out the details and be
able to make his report beyond any
chance of mistake at length the same
animal cunning-which had caused him
to crouch to earth and which had kept
him silent and watchful where another
might have spoken or given some sign
 

the seventh glass

to warn the one upon whom he spied-
came again to his aid

  the next day he opened his smithy
and in the evening went to call upon
marie she was glad to see him and
madame cirey was far more cordial
than she had been before quite plainly
the aeroplane came to the meadow only
at intervals he decided and it had
coroe last night he glanced at marie
verdun has not yet fallen he re-
marked

  no not yet marie smiled

  i am not sure that it will ever fall
max declared still-they are send-
ing in several new divisions

  marie did not meet his glance di-
rectly how do you know that she
inquired

 oh i know-many things max
nodded he was following out the line
he had laid down for himself planned
out that day while he worked about the
smithy there is much i could tell
one hears things even in a hospital
marie and suddenly he sat up and
took his pipe from his teeth and leaned
toward her yes there is much i
could tell if there were any way of get-
ting that knowledge where it would do
the most good if-he sank his voice
-there was a way to get it to-the
people who hold verdun

  max marie cirey sprang to her
feet her eyes widened swiftly her
lips parted her bosom swelled and
she raised a hand to her breast and
held it there while she stood staring

into the face of the man you-

she said in a whisper after a time

  marie madame cirey spoke from
where she was sitting beside the lamp
with the mending over which she
seemed always busy

  max turned his glance and found her
eyes dark and bright upon him her
colorless lips set into a shadowed line
he held out his crippled hand now free
of the bandage almost clawlike with its
remaining finger and thumb

  see you he exclaimed do you
think i forget this and you must not
forget that my mother was of alsace
even as you mother cirey or that i
am her son what if i have fought
in the german army could i do any-
thing else i who was a german sub-
ject had i a choice think you i
may not have a choice now as to what
i shall do my hand i have given to
the german butr-almost uncon-
sciously he voiced a paraphrase of
kummers thought spoken days before
-may i not now give my brains else-
where if i so will 

  and your brains could give infor-
mation if there was a way to-use it
marie said quickly before her mother
could speak

  a zabems blue eyes did not
waver as he made the reply

 but- marie laughed the

sound was more that of nervous emo-
tion than of any humor did you not
tell me that even to jest of anything
contrary to german expectation was
forbidden max

  a he said again it is forbidden
one must decide whether he will obey
that is true madame cirey
caught up his words one must de-
cide and if there was a way to-
use it-you would give-information
she said slowly at last

zabem nodded a i would give
it now and you could write it down
i marie caught her breath
again her lips parted and her eyes went
wide and her face a trifle pale

  you yes you could give it to the
aeroplane when it comes again max
said

  and after that there was silence
marie cireys face grew paler still but
her widened eyes did not falter nor
did she change her position though her
interlocked fingers gripped possibly
closer the one upon the other until their
backs grew white you-know she
breathed in a sibilant whisper at length
the seventh glass



  i told you i knew many things
max nodded his head

  who else-who else knows ma-
ries mother broke in with a question
which quivered tensely she laid down
her work and sat staring at max with
her sharp brown eyes

  no one i think he told her and
explained about the difference in the
sound of the engine i was sleepless
and was walking the fields i heard it
come down and started to find out
about it it flew away before i reached
the meadow back of the woods but i
saw the light in the loft and i saw
marie

 you saw me why didnt you
speak the girl exclaimed

  i might have startled you-made
you afraid max returned besides
i was surprised i went home and
thought i made up my mind and came
here to-night what was in the thing
you were dragging marie

  utaubern she answered him in a
word

  carrier pigeons max nodded
why so then we can write out what
i know and send it off at once it is
important that is better than to wait
for the aeroplane

  it comes only to bring the pigeons
now and again mother maries
last word was an appeal a question
she turned toward the woman by the
table

  madame cireys glance rested on the
face of her daughter shifted and
seemed to search the heavier features
of the man to whom the girls heart
was pledged it is what the pigeons
are for my children she said after a
time

  marie nodded she sprang up smil-
ing she found paper very light and
very thin and very strong she brought
it back to the table close to the lamp
and drew up a chair tell me max
tell me while i write it down she
prompted and lifting her eyes ashine

with emotion as he came to ner side
oh max isnt it splendid when the
body may serve the heart in its wish 

  we will tell them of the new divi-
sions to be sent in at verdun zabern
said write what i say and be sure
that you get it right

  in ten minutes it was done max
had read it over and marie was rolling
it up to be inserted in a quill for trans-
mission there was a great joy to-
night in her heart as she carefully
twisted the paper in her fingers and
there was a light in her face a smile
on her soft lips as she turned again to
max come she invited i shall
show you where our little messengers
are kept safe from prying eyes

  she led him to the steps that ran
from a comer of the room into the cel-
lar with his hand in hers she guided
him down bade him stand where he
was until she found and lighted a can-
dle and gave it to him to hold then
while he watched she approached the
wall of the cellar which was of rock
laid hold of a stone and wrenched it
out of place two other stones she
removed in a similar fashion and ex-
posed a cavity in the earth behind the
wall from this she dragged a wicker
hamper which she set upon the floor
a rustle came from it-a sound of mo-
tion marie lifted the lid slightly
thrust in a hand and drew out a flutter-
ing bird while max held this she
lifted the hamper back through the
wall and replaced the stones they put
out the candle and went back up the
stairs

  while max watched marie affixed
the tiny quill containing the message-
that useless message which zabems
strategy had suggested he should offer
to send as an evidence of good faith
she took the bird in her hands and
kissed it on the head and over it with
her lips against its plumage she looked
into max zaberns eyes with her
womans soul in her own come she

said and rose come max and led
him out of doors

  it was quiet there quiet and dark
with a soft air blowing through the
valley standing close beside him
holding the pigeon marie waited a mo-
ment then tossed it into the air

  it fluttered and rose-was gone-
lost to their vision in the night

  the woman turned to her companion
max she whispered max dear-
there isnt any reason why i cannot
be your wife when you wish it kiss
me max

  zabem drew her into his arms she
was soft rounded yielding so you
do not wish to wait until the war is
ended he said in a voice which
though heavy still shook as he felt the
nearness of her form

  not now she told hm with her
lips on his before-i could not have
been your wife and still have done my
jvork for france

  so that was it he muttered she
was a simple honest little thing she
wouldnt give up her work and she
wouldnt marry him and try to do any-
thing against him or his or live a lie
of course stupid she laughed
stupid i may be said zabem but
i can understand a thing when i hear
it to-day i opened my smithy i must
see the results of my work

  five minutes later he left her and
turned along the road toward the vil-
lage he went slowly because his feet
lagged as he thought he had meant
to be clever to-night and he had been
he had been very very clever he
had fooled both marie and her mother
with his talk and that message of no
value to those who would receive it
and he had learned all that kummer
had told him to find out still he
felt no elation in that rather he felt
something like a dull gnawing pain

  marie had been very sweet-very
very sweet-while they stood there in
the dark outside the house and her

body had been so soft so yielding as
she lay against him every line of her
feminine presence had cried to him in
a voiceless- appeal and she had said
she would be his whenever he desired
and he desired her wanted her-as a
strong man may but he had told her
he must first see the results of his work
there had been a sinister double mean-
ing in that which she did not suspect
-which he had not meant her to even
dream of only now he asked himself
what the result of his work would be
-not the work in the smithy as marie
had thought but that other work to
which he had been sent by kummer-
that work which he had been told to
do for the fatherland similar in its way
to the work marie was doing for
france max zabem clenched his one
strong hand as he walked and lifted
his face to the star-sprinkled sky
herr gott he questioned what is
a man to do

  yet even while he questioned max
zabem knew always he had been
trained to obey and was not the cer-
tain victory for which the high com-
mand labored a greater thing than the
hunger of a human heart did not
the needs of the high command come
always first  had not he zabem seen
homes disrupted men tom from wives
sons-yes and daughters from mothers
-in northern france and deported to
do the work set them by the order of
their conquerors pitiful yes if a
man let himself think about it but a
thing brought about by the exigencies
of the situation-by their own peoples
foolish resistance to the fatherlands
designs and decreed by that same high
command which through the person of
kummer had set him also a task to
perform kummer had said to his ques-
tion it is an order so then what
was there to do but obey what use
to argue past that

  he was up and off with the first faint
light trudging along the road away
the seventh glass



from the village with a face grimly set
toward the nearest garrison command

  he was back by the middle of the
afternoon somewhat hag-ridden by the
knowledge that behind him a vieefeld-
weble and four men were headed for
the village from the town to which he
had gone he entered the smithy and
looked around there was nothing to
hold his interest there he went into
the house and sat down but the room
was hot with the afternoon sun its
air close

  he left it and went outside again and
glanced up the street no sign of the
soldiers yet presently he turned back
and gained the fields behind the house
-those fields be had crossed two nights
before when the enemy aeroplane had
come down back of the little wood be-
hind marie cireys home he moved
slowly across them now and after a
time as he drew nearer the wood itself
he bent and went forward skulking
under such cover as he could find until
he gained it and had hidden himself
behind a tree from where he could see
the little whitewashed house

  an hour passed while he stood there
shifting from one leg to the other the
sun was hanging just over the western
line of the hills and then he saw them
-the vicefeldweble and his four men
five dusty gray-green figures plodding
heavily along the road

  they reached the whitewashed house
turned and were lost to sight max
could picture them passing between the
rows of stiff-standing hollyhocks with
their bells of pink and red and white
then once more he saw them coming
around the house he saw them halt
saw the vicefeldweble knock upon the
door saw the door open and the five
men pass from sight

  a sudden weakness such as he had
never experienced before came into his
legs as he saw them vanish his knees
knocked together and he sank down to
a sitting position without taking his eyes

from the house he began to breathe
like one who has run far after a bit
he edged about the tree so that he could
get his back against it and sat flat-
legged watching for the five men to
reappear

  what were they doing what was
going on inside the whitewashed house
why didnt the men come out with the
women they had come to take

  by and by the sun went quite down
behind the hills and twilight fell still
the vicefcldweble and the four privates
had not reappeared zabems eyes be-
gan to blur from the strain of his watch-
ing and he rubbed them with his fin-
gers why didnt the men come out
he commenced to feel a vague premo-
nition of something amiss as the twi-
light deepened and the house became
an indistinct mass it struck him as
very odd that they should have gone
into it on such a mission and not come
out

  then he saw a light it flashed from
a window of that room where he and
marie and her mother had sat last night
he drew a deep breath that was bet-
ter there was a sort of dumb reas-
surance in the light leaping up like that

  very slowly he got to his feet and
began to go forward through the grass
and the weeds where he had seen marie
dragging the hamper of pigeons toward
the house he walked slowly bent half
over despite the covet of the darkness
now that it was night he decided to
see what was going on inside the room
where some one had lighted a lamp

  by degrees he made his way quite
to the house sank down and crept to
a place beneath the lighted window
lifted himself edged his head above
the sill and remained staring with start-
ing eyes into the room

  it was occupied by a very strange
company max thought indeed when
he first caught sight of them he felt
sure that he understood the reason for
their delay in coming forth the vice-


the seventh glass

feldweble and his attendants were still
in the room one of them had fallen
on the floor the vicefeldwebles head
was sunk down so that it lay on the
table one of them was lying back
in his chair with his jaw somewhat
sagged as though he slept in sodden
slumber and another had slumped
down drunkenly where he sat

  that was odd enough in all con-
science but there was more yet to see
there were bottles on the table and
glasses-one before each mans place-
empty glasses-five of them in all
and there was a lamp on the table not
far from the farther end-the same
lamp beside which madame cirey had
worked on her mending last night and
madame cirey was there at the end of
the table now so that the lamplight
shone on her face and she was smil-
ing-smiling very queerly indeed max
thought and nodding her head like one
who bowed to this one and that of the
vicefeldwebles men who plainly didnt
see her at all and in front of her
max now noted a bottle similar in
every way to those others on the table

  so much he saw and then quite sud-
denly he ducked down because ma-
dame cirey lifted her face and her
eyes very dark and seeming to glitter
strangely looked directly toward the
window where he stood squatting
against the wall of the house max
frowned as he pondered what he had
seen the five men and the five empty
glasses and the old woman nodding her
head and smiling at her end of the table
close by the lighted lamp but there
was no sign of marie what had be-
come of her abruptly max rose and
passed with a heavy stride to the door
threw it open without so much as rap-
ping entered the room and paused
what does this mean he cried

  the woman at the table turned her
withered face her dark eyes peered
toward him she simpered in a hideous
way which showred her age-darkened

teeth back of her bloodless lips ah
judas she quavered shrilly in recog-
nition we have been waiting for
you judas she gestured toward the
men about the table with a withered
hand

  and those men were dead max
knew it knew it now that he saw them
more closely the aura of their dying
hung in the closed-in atmosphere of
the room as a faint taint in the air
in a stride he reached the simpering
womans side seized her by her arm
and shook her with the impulsive fury
of the realization what happened
what happened  he cried

  her eyes hard dry bright as the
eyes of a mind unbalanced lifted to
his face and again she leered but
she said no word merely stared up-
ward at him with that horrible grin
stretching the lines of her mouth and
wrinkling her cheeks

  zabern thrust her from him so that
she fell into her chair his glance
searched the room came back to the
vicefeldweble and his men and the five
empty glasses before their places on the
table they were dead but it was not
to learn that that he had come once
more he turned to the woman who
seemed watching his every action
where is marie he spoke in gruff
demand

  and now the woman by the table
gave vent to an insane cackle she
nodded at the vice feldweble and the
bodies of his men ask them she
said and nodded again as she spoke
they know

  herr gotti zabern burst out he
twisted about on a heavy heel there
was no sense in the woman she was
crazy to tell him to ask five dead men
in answer to his question he hurled
himself in a rush at the closed door of
a room he knew was maries bedroom
threw himself against it and burst it
open peered into its small dimensions
with pupil-widened eyes reached the
the seventh glass



bed and flung his arms across it grop-
ingly thrust a heavy leg and thigh be-
neath it in search of a crouching hid-
den body and found nothing turned
and dashed out of the room

  the woman still sat where he had
left her the simper had come back
to her face her dark eyes met his
and she turned her head so that they
followed him as he plunged into the
other bedroom failed once more in his
search and came out

  he leaped up the stairs to the little
loft where the light had burned the
other night reached the head and stood
peering into the shadows of the place
marie-marie he called softly and
gaining no answer turned about and
went down more slowly while the
woman at the table still watched

  he moved now in the clutch of a
growing impression the attitude of
the old woman and her manner the
strange silence of the place and the
presence of the five men were affecting
him very oddly they all breathed of
something far more dreadful than he
had touched as yet and there re-
mained but one place to search the
cellar suddenly max knew that there
he would find the answer to his ques-
tion because the old woman had said
the dead men knew and-he had given
very complete information to the com-
mander of the garrison that morning
he had even told them how to find the
pigeons back of the wall the vicefem-
weble had known just where to search
when he came

  he caught up the light from the table
crossed to the cellar stairs and went
down with the light lifted to throw
its rays before him he found what
he sought at last

  the hole in the cellar wall was open
the hamper was out on the floor and
beside it was the form of a woman clad
in a mere clinging shred of clothing
through which the beauty of her fair
young body gleamed she lay in what

  atb

seemed a tortured huddle her dark
hair tangled about her face the glaze
of her dead eyes glistened as the lamp-
light struck them through her half-open
lids and across the bared whiteness
of her body was a fearful sight-a
great gashing stab which had nearly
severed the breast before it entered her
heart from which the red blood was
gushing

  herr gottt the words burst from
max zabems lips while he knelt and
covered his eyes after a time his lips
moved again marie

  horror-sick blind horror-seized
him he turned drunkenly to the stairs
lurching and stumbling on their treads
as he fled from that scene of ravished
innocence to the room above

  the old woman was in the same
place yet it would seem that she must
have moved while he was below be-
cause now in addition to the bottle
max had noted beside her he saw two
other glasses fresh and unsoiled by
use

  max replaced the light as she lifted
her hard bright eyes did you find
it judas-the result of your work
she leered

  the result of his work heliger
gotti the woman was quoting the
very words he had spoken to marie
last night-to marie who now lay in
the darkness of the cellar with her soft
body gashed open beside the wicker
hamper he drew back a pace but
without shifting his gaze from those
eyes which seemed some way to hold
him my work he found himself
saying thickly

  the woman nodded he-she
pointed to the vtcefeldiveble-told me
judas it was because of that i waited
for your coming because there could
be no doubt you would come to see the
result of your work

  a cold perspiration broke out on
zabems forehead his hand fdt


the seventh glass

clammy and damp he opened his lips
as though to speak but uttered no
sound

  sit down judas the woman said

  her eyes still held him and he obeyed
and sank into a chair

  they came the woman went on
they found the pigeons where you
knew they were kept but there was
something else more to their liking than
pigeons judas-a woman-a fair
young woman-just one for five human
beasts they drew lots for her judas
you remember the soldiers cast lots for
the clothing of christ but these sol-
diers drew lots to see who should be
the first to smirch the bloom of virtue
in a little human flower and-she
rose quickly leaned over and spat into
the dead face of the vicefeldweble-
he won

  but she fought she said sinking
back you should have seen how she
fought to protect that for which they
had drawn lots but-i am forgetting
-you have seen that havent you ju-
das-how she fought she fought so
hard that afterward they were thirsty
from their work and demanded wine of
her mother-the woman who had borne
her for such a fate i gave it to them
one bottle two three you can see them
on the table i gave them a fourth
this one here beside me which know-
ing the german thirst i had prepared
while they were busy with the others
only-the last judas wras not quite
like the first into it i had put some
of that substance i kept to kill other
vermin in my garden and after they
had drunk it they became very tired-
oh very very tired as one may see
from the postures into which they have
fallen here about my table where j
have sat waiting for you because you
see judas i knew you must come it
was but natural that you would be
somewhere watching and would arrive
when these other vermin of hell failed
to reappear and now that you have

come judas will you share my-hos-
pitality 

  she lifted a clawlike hand and laid
hold of the neck of the bottle see
judas here are two other glasses be-
sides those five soiled ones from which
they drank five for them judas one
for you and one for me seven in all
and there is wine-not much but
enough will you drink with me ju-
das of this wine which will make you
forget-many things-and give you-
rest she broke off and sat staring
at him above the slanted neck of the
bottle in her hand

  but zabern made no reply a hand
seemed gripping his throat choking his
breath back into his chest where his
heart was beating slowly with dull
heavy strokes it was an icy hand
which appeared to have slipped up back
of his jaws defying any articulate an-
swer to the womans words

  come judas-will you drink

  neint suddenly max found his
tongue he sprang to his feet he had
for the moment but one thought one
wish-to get-out of this room of death
to get away from those dark insane
eyes under the gray hair in the midst
of that wrinkled leering face

  a cackle of mocking sardonic laugh-
ter broke forth in the room no
clucked the woman no as ab-
ruptly as her laughter had begun it
was checked she rose lifted an arm
and pointed to the door then go
judas-get you gone-to the hell of
your thoughts-from which there is no
escape-except-to drink-and for-
get 

  toward the door max zabern flung
himself dashed through it into the
night running running running with
heavy feet which pounded dully away
from the whitewashed house toward
the woods and blindly through them
to the meadow where the aeroplane had
come down before he checked his
course
the seventh glass



  at last he found himself sitting in
the little burial ground beside a
rocked-in rectangle of flower-planted
earth-that grave which had been so
carefully tended by marie mutter
he said dully mutteri

  hours passed wherein max lived
over his life his childhood boyhood
youth and manhood leading back
along the path of the years to this night
and the horror of the whitewashed
house-the horror from which he had
fled here to his mothers grave cared
for and tended by the hands of the girl
he had betrayed

  judas the girls mother had called
him her mind unhinged by that same
horror which she had witnessed in all
its dreadful details because what had
come to pass was the result of his work
it was to that he had betrayed her like
that other judas betrayed her with
her kiss upon his lips

  kummer would be glad of that glad
of that horror glad to know it he
would consider it but another incident
in the progress toward the final fruition
of the plans of the high command
the high command  who were they
what right had they to order things
which swept aside all the principles of
human goodness compassion mercy
decency right which controverted all
the standards toward the perfection of
which man had been striving for cen-
turies past which took husbands
fathers sons and made of them brute
beasts to blindly do their bidding be-
cause it was an order to be obeyed
which sent him here to crouch in the
night beside the grave feeling that the
name of judas was one deserved be-
cause of the horror which had resulted
from the work they had sent him to do

  he lifted his face and gazed at the
star-sprinkled heavens his mother
was dead this was her grave here
which marie had tended his father
was dead because the high command
had needed him in their plan marie

was dead and the vice feldweble and
his men they were dead too and
he sat here in the night alone now in
all the world

  by and by as horror had driven him
forth so horror led him back there
was something like a dreadful fascina-
tion about it it seemed to call him
draw him to what it held he found
himself wondering what he would find
on his return if the old woman would
be still sitting there at the table with
her bottle of wine and the glasses star-
ing at the dead men out of her dark
bright eyes

  he approached it from the front
passing along the path between the hol-
lyhock rows and so around to the rear

  a faint gray light was stealing up
over the eastern hills but the lamp still
burned and the door was open just
as he had left it in rushing forth hours
ago the old woman still sat in her
chair but her head too had fallen
forward upon the table beside the bot-
tle and the lamp and-there was a sixth
soiled glass where there had been only
five before

  max nodded in comprehension he
understood she had not waited for
his return after he rushed out to that
hell of his thoughts the remorse which
had torn at his breast all night like the
fangs of a wolf she had drunk her
portion of the wine

  walking on tiptoe he crossed the
room and lifted the lamp then went
softly to the corner where the stairs
led down to the cellar he crept down
slowly made his way to the body be-
side which he knelt and held the light
above the motionless face

  a sound fell on his ear it came
from the hamper on the floor max
approached it on his knees and lifted
the lid a pigeon crouched within
looking up at him out of yellow-brown
eyes he took it in his hand for a
moment he thought it odd that the vice-
feldweble and his men should have left
ioo

the seventh glass

it alive but then he understood that
it had been of far less interest to them
than the girl whose tender body lay
beside him here on the floor

  catching the pigeon between the
clawlike finger and thumb of his ruined
hand he took up the lamp and made
his way back up the stairs

  he knew where marie had kept her
supply of paper and the quills he
had seen her produce them the night
before he found them now and a bit
of pencil and sat down to write very
slowly he formed the message he
wanted to send-the story of what had
happened in the whitewashed house
he rolled it up and put it into the quill
and affixed the quill to the pigeon just
as marie had done

  his mind went back to the dead girl
beneath him on the cellar floor the
lamp was dying now its flame smoking
and guttering out the gray light of
morning was to his sickened fancy a
funeral pall there was even a chill
in the air there was the chill of death
all about him

  there was one way to escape the hell
of his thoughts that was to drink and
forget the old woman had said that
just before he had rushed forth into
the night and what had that other
judas done when his work had been
finished 

  very slowly he drew the unused glass
and the bottle to him still holding the
pigeon he lifted the bottle and poured
out the wine it filled the glass and
ran over on the table in a dull red flood
-as red as blood-as red as the wound
in the white breast of the girl he had
betrayed

  the pigeon held fast in his hand sat
warm against his flesh it turned its
head and watched him out of its yel-
lowish-brown eyes

  to the high command said max
zabem and drank-the seventh glass

  the fingers which held the pigeon
relaxed it stirred then finding itself
freed from all restraint it spread
strong sure wings and as zabems
spirit passed his cold lips flew out of
the open door

out of sight

i am standing within a few feet of several hundred people but i cannot set
any of them you said it is sad to be blind ah yes you are right it is
sad to be blind but i am not blind my friend i am standing in a cemetery

if ever there was a quaint pair of
companions it was richards and
graham who used to frequent the
cafe dharcourt on the boulevard st
michel paris

  when richards had been younger he
had wooed the spirit of poetry now
he devoted himself entirely to the
green lady absinth at the cafe the
students and their friends used to
wager upon the number of glasses he
would consume in a night graham
knew of this wagering and it annoyed
him strangely but habit being stronger
than friendship he stuck to his pallid
cadaverous friend he was the one
intimate richards kept this shabby ape-
like english ex-jockey who ran a tiny
billiard room in a side street

  graham tolerated richards because
out of the growing confusion of his
brain came certain biting morbid truths
which made him laugh richards was
a sharp one there was no denying
even if he did talk like a madman and
lately his mind had been running on

the grisly terrors of death-terrors to
be kept at bay

  as for drinking beer was his tipple
only one of a pair of pals could go in
for absinth

  queer-looking fellow richards
thin with high cheek bones showing
under the tautly drawn skin the
corners of his lips sagging and weary
only his eyes were alive though they
seemed too large for the sockets he
let his hair grow too long and hang
untidily over the collar of his old velvet
jacket too busy drinking and raving
to pay attention to his appearance but
clever as they make them graham
used to tell him

  damme if only youd give up the
booze youd knock em all to bits with
your writing

  nothing he could say did any good
however and he was alarmed to notice
that his friend was growing more cadav-
erous more taciturn climbing out of
their sphere of communication and he
had already begun to cast about in his


the conqueror

mind as to the advisibility of breaking
off the association

  he looked at richards to-night
there was a curious abrasion on his
forehead he had drunk his fifth glass
and yet he was not affected by it the
bony hand which held a cigarette on
the level of the marble table trembled
slightly-that was all the eyes were
motionless what did he mean by that
empty soulless gaze at the mirror it
was more than queer it was depress-
ing nobody comes to a cafe to stare
and silence is uncomfortable after half
an hour the silence was unbreakable
he must be going this was a fine
way to pass an evening what was
he watching what did he see it
was getting on his nerves he must
speak he must ask and before he
knew he heard himself say

  whats the idea-watching that
mirror youre always staring at it
richards started shuddered and re-
plied slowly

  because my beetle is there thats
all graham all

  what beetle are you talking about
some new pet graham said with
a relieved sigh

  it was only a beetle which attracted
him-something crawling he opened
his mouth in a laugh but checked it
suddenly as richards turned on him
with a frown

  what is it old man he demanded
anxiously anything wrong

  richards turned his head slowly
away and resumed his staring

  grahams spirit rose in rebellion
was he going to let himself be treated
with this contempt  whatever had
possessed him to pal up with this crazy
man he ran over the reasons in his
sullen mind but at this hour none of
them seemed logical

  look here richards he com-
menced coarsely the blood mounting
to his forehead none of that with me

surely im a damn sight more interest-
ing than any beetle

  richards turned sharply and looked
at him his hand rested on the edge
of the marble top and he drew his fore-
finger up and down it as though de-
riving a sensuous pleasure from the
cold contact

  im sorry graham i should feel
sorry to lose you youll forgive me
but this beetle of mine-

 yes what about him asked
graham shaking off his grievance

  after all richards wasnt such a bad
chap bit dreamy and had to be
humored

  richards looked at him earnestly

  graham he said slowly i think
that in your narrow little penthouse of
a soul you understand me

  graham nodded that was a queer
beginning but no doubt well meant

  if that is so you can see something
of the working of my brain not it
all-eh 

  youre a bit above me at times
graham mumbled

  then let me tell you of something
which happened to me the other
day- he hesitated with an appeal-
ing glance from his projecting eyes

  oh go ahead graham assured
do you good to tell it

  i was wandering i get fits of wan-
dering through the day theres nothing
to do-and i like to moon about till
evening and the cafe have you ever
felt that the daylight was full of horror
as if a great searchlight was beating
its questioning rays on your naked soul
and showing its deformities to a sneer-
ing world the city is no place for
me then it is full of shapeless things
with the bodies of men-and women
decayed senilities-pretty outsides of
creatures ripe to the rotting empty
skins that have held conceit of beauty
all these rustle past as you walk in a
city-i seek ihe country when i feel
like that it is fresh and the air is pure

clean and wholesome one day last
week i went to-i dont know where-
i dont know if i should recognize it
again if i saw it ah ah  there he
goes

  graham started as richards glance
went eagerly to the wall

  yes yes he said as if to a tired
child i see

  they have marshes there i remem-
ber the marshes best of all there was
a little blue flower which held out its
friendly hands to me and there was a
stone wall green mosses grew along

it i nearly trod on a lizard-

  he stopped inarticulate

  graham yawned behind his hand
what about the lizard he asked
lighting a cigar hastily what did it
do old man

  you see when i saw him lying there
i felt inclined to run away i wish i
had

  him graham interjected with a
sudden shudder

  the body richards emphasized
i wish youd listen

  i am but you said nothing about a
body

  didnt i well the body was lying
there in the shadow of the wall i
thought he was sleeping till i bent over
him i almost began to fancy i had
murdered him but i hadnt why
should i  i had no grudge against him
so i couldnt have killed him could i
now graham

  oh lord no ejaculated graham
he put his hand up to his brow it was
wet decidedly this fellow gave him
the creeps when was he going to give
that cynical grin of his and croak i
frightened you that time eh

  still there he was lying richards
monotoned his hat had a dent in it
i shoved it off with my cane and it
rolled a little way it had a red silk
lining with the letters w g r in gold
stuck in it my initials graham
queer eh  some hairs sticking-

wasnt a pretty sight i turned him
over one hand was clutching the
grass have you ever imagined seeing
your dead self its funny i laughed
it was so ludicrous that i should be
looking at myself lying there with a
hole in the brow-just there then it
made me quite sick i felt ill when i
thought that i had laughed

  graham shrank away from him

  that was the curious part of it
there were three of us the dead
man the man who laughed and the man
who wondered and felt physically ill
seeing those other two i couldnt
make it out and the sun shining down
so brightly then all at once as i
looked at the dead man-his face
changed-it wasnt me-it was another
-some one i didnt know queer thing

i	didnt think of the risk they might
have come and found me there-
thought i had dirtied my hands with
murder

  what did you do did you leave
him graham asked licking his lips
nervously

  it was then i saw my beetle creep
from the hat see there he is-over
there-on the wall

  graham looked sharply in the direc-
tion of the pointing finger for the
first time he realized that there was a
real beetle which crawled stealthily up
and down the wall he shuddered

 good lord good lord he
quavered gaping at richards with eyes
which asked mutely and found no an-
swer

  thats the little fellow-my little
soul dye understand my soul
richards continued in a whisper hes
always there when i come into the cafe

i	have to take great care of him when
he goes i go too-like that

  he snapped his long fingers as though
snuffing a candle

  when he left the hat i knew him
for myself a crawling creature
thats he thats me he knew where
i

the conqueror

to come to find me-eh crafty-cun-
ning he is king of them-king of the

beetles

  graham tried to rise his limbs re-
fused to move he seemed to be
bound hand and foot seated looking
through a peephole into a chamber
whose vaulted darkness was peopled
with unknown horror

  king of the beetles hell conquer
them all even as i will conquer this
crumbling frame of mine im not
afraid of the struggle yet i come here
every night to watch him guard him
but why should i if he has to fight
let him fight it out himself my cham-
pion against death-death his voice
rose to a thin whisper which seemed to
master the noise of the cafe

  graham felt it strike on his ear and
recoiled as though from a blow he
was suddenly impelled to look at the
wall he knew he must shriek and
could not it was as if he had been
planted on a desert isle with this mad-
man remote from human aid from
the corner of the mirror another black
thing-a second beetle-was descending
with menacing approach he glanced
at richards and found his face was
working convulsively

  it comes graham he seemed to
say though no sound came from his
lips it comes

  graham turned his back the better
to see what was going to happen on the
wall it held him intense he recog-
nized the first one-richards-by a
tiny red spot on his back quite per-
ceptible at that distance and by some
freak of the imagination the mark re-
minded him of the hole in the skull

  the beedes met they recognized
that they were foes for with a spasm
of ferocity they engaged fastening
their strong mandibles about each
others legs it was a wonder they did

not fall from the wall once richards
one dropped a few inches graham
started as he heard his friend give a
low laugh was it possible he had
confused the two beetles he would
tell him his mistake when it was over
it would be something to laugh at

  graham began to lose his fear the
sporting in him came to his aid he
felt as if he were watching two wres-
tlers two pugilists two wild beasts tear-
ing each other with bloody jaws and
foam-flecked skins he clutched the
arm of his chair he whispered to him-
sell

  the little un wins he wins no-
hes getting it sore no shake him
again go on go on

  he forgot all else the cafe and
richards had vanished he did not
see richards sitting with the face of
one who opens a closed door and be-
holds his fate grisly with welcome

  god he said to himself theyre
putting up a real fight

  still the struggle continued the
bigger beetle-or were they of one
size-he could not tell now was win-
ning

  give it him now a good bite for
old richards another thats the
style another tumble him on his
back

  he was sure the red-marked one was
winning old richards would be think-
ing he was losing

  thats it thats it he heard him-
self cry out joyfully your beetle
wins by god richards hes won-
knocked the other one clear off the
wall

  he turned with the words on his lips
his blinking eyes ablaze with excite-
ment

  but the man beside him gave no reply
he was crouched up in his seat con-
quered by the foe he dreaded-death

chapter xi

merrill found it amazingly easy
to carry out his impersonation
no trouble was made over his
passport he answered the description
as well as lowell had and the photo-
graph was as like him as it had been
like lowell nor was any objection
made to his returning to paris his ex-
cuse of distaste for another attempt to
cross the channel being accepted as
quite natural

  by midday he was in paris again

with all of lowells luggage and com-
fortably settled in a room in the hotel
lutetia on the left bank of the seine
he knew he had but little time before
he must report his arrival and register
but as he had not yet had time to look
over lowells effects he locked his door
and set about that task

  the greatest need he had was for
money and for the first time he dared
to take out the wallet and examine it
it contained a greatly depleted book
of bankers checks which naturally he
io

strasbourg rose

could not think of tiying to use since
he had no wish to commit forgery even
if he had been able to do so besides
there would be no need since lowell
in his fear of being caught in a place
where he couldnt cash his checks had
turned most of them into money in the
form of bank of england notes to the
amount of five hundred pounds all of
which reposed in their crisp newness
in the wallet

  with a sigh of relief followed by a
murmur of wonder at the absurd con-
duct of the young american in carry-
ing such a quantity of money in cash
merrill proceeded to examine the con-
tents of the luggage

  there were two suit cases and a
trunk they contained a quantity of
clothing of various sorts an odd as-
sortment of jewelry and trifles picked
up evidently in italy and in paris and
at the very bottom of the trunk another
bundle of bank of england notes
wrapped in brown paper like an ordi-
nary package there were five hun-
dred pounds in the bundle

  merrill shook his head poor fel-
low  he thought i suppose he found
it difficult when he first came over to
use his checks and so at the first op-
portunity and when there was no longer
any need of it he cashed them the
only sensible thing he did was to have
his money in bank of england notes
which are good anywhere-perhaps
even in germany well it serves me
well id have been in a bad way with-
out this money and maybe ill be in
a bad way when i come to settle with
his heirs he shrugged his shoulders
recklessly  face that problem
when im confronted with it

  in truth he was in such a mood that
he cared little for the risk he was run-
ning of being caught in what would be
considered a criminal act the fact
that he was very wealthy would not
count for much if his deception was
detected what really concerned him

  was what had happened to rose dal-
meyrac had she made her escape
from the restaurant if she had was
she now in paris if she were not in
paris where was she  and if she had
been captured had she been shot 

  but through these questions the old
ones went weaving about in his brain
what did it all mean why had he
been sent away so peremptorily how
could rose dalmeyrac-the girl he
knew and loved-have done that awful
thing if she had done it how was
it humanly possible for her to escape
how had she dared to come to paris
and show herself openly

  often he wondered if the woman he
saw in the restaurant could have been
some one who looked like rose but
he always dismissed the suggestion as
impossible she had recognized him
and had been afraid why should she
fear him didnt she know that he
would give his life for her hadnt
he proved his willingness

  and yet it was true as he considered
it as he had been considering it almost
every moment since die meeting that
she looked older more sophisticated
moreover she had been dressed richly
and fashionably and had conducted
herself like one perfectly at home in
paris on the other hand how little
these things meant to one who was so
wonderful an actress he groaned
whenever he thought of it she was a
wonderful actress where did the act-
ing begin and how much of what he
had seen was acting how much the ex-
pression of that beautiful nature he had
come to love

  finally it all came back to the same
thing whatever she was he must
find out and to find out it was neces-
sary for him to see her again and talk
with her he knew he would love her
whatever she proved to be but he also
knew that if she was not what he
wished her to be and what in his heart
of hearts he believed her to be he would
strasbourg rose



have the strength to give her up and

go his way

  he did all the things required by the
military and civil regulations and being
securely established in paris set about
finding rose he knew he could not
hope to come upon her as he had done
the night before that sort of thing
doesnt happen twice and yet he knew
no way excepting to search restaurants
and to walk the streets

  he would have been a figure to at-
tract attention if all paris had not been
so preoccupied in those sad days he
had not shaved after reaching paris
permitting his beard to grow as a pro-
tection against recognition so that for
a while he had that unkempt look that
a man always has under such circum-
stances

  he made a nightly round of the cafes
on the grand boulevard sitting for a
while in one and then in another
watching the passers-by and studying
the inmates he walked the main
streets and the by-streets from mont-
parnasse to the montmartre from the
bois de boulogne to the place de la
republique

  the streets were dim but he was
sure that if he saw rose dalmeyrac
in the most obscure comer he would
recognize her and finally he did see
her he was wandering with savage
hopelessness through the avenue
hoche going from the arc de tri-
omphe to the parc de monceau when
he saw an automobile draw up to the
curb in front of one of the great
houses it was so rarely that one saw
an automobile in use by a private per-
son that merrill loitered idly as he ap-
proached a lady got out having
opened the door for herself merrills
heart almost stopped beating it was
rose dalmeyrac

  i shant want you any more to-
night she said to the chauffeur and
crossed the pavement rapidly and en-
tered the court through the little door

  which had been opened at the approach
of the car

  merrills immediate sensation was
one of profound relief rose dalmey-
rac was alive then and at liberty his
first conscious reflection was the amaz-
ing thought that she went about not
only as if she had no fear but as if
she were a favored person why
should she be in possession of an auto-
mobile when most persons had been
obliged to give up their cars to the
government 

  he walked home to his hotel trying
to fathom the mystery that surrounded
the girl he remembered hearing it
whispered in the cafes that there was a
strangely powerful system of german
espionage established in the very heart
of paris that defied the utmost efforts
of the authorities to root out was
it possible that rose was really affili-
ated with that body was there such
a body he had always smiled scorn-
fully at the thought of it for so far
as his own experience went it was not
possible to exist in paris for one hour
without coming under the observation
of the constituted authorities

  however he had found her and it
was his settled determination to dis-
cover what the mystery was that en-
veloped her he was sure from the
way she had entered the house and
dismissed her chauffeur that she lived
there

  now he would contrive somehow to
watch her until he had learned some-
thing what he was to learn or what
he would do afterward he was going
to leave to chance to the suggestion
of the moment he felt as a fly might
feel at finding itself unexpectedly tan-
gled in a web he couldnt even be
sure that the spider wasnt quietly wait-
ing for the appropriate moment to
pounce on him

  the thing that held him to his pur-
pose from first to last was that he had
been going about his own proper busi-
iob

strasbourg rose

ness when he was suddenly deflected

and caught up in a whirl of events for
which he was in no way responsible
now with jaws set he was going to
see the matter through to the endr he
felt that no person nor any set of per-
sons no matter how high-placed had
any right to make a shuttlecock of him

  besides he loved this girl be she
whom she might he had thrilled at
the sight of her and at the sound of
her voice when she spoke to the chauf-
feur he had caught his breath and al-
most cried out to her

  the next morning he went to the av-
enue hoche and without going too
near the house she had entered he
loitered about in a way to avoid as
much as possible any attention and for-
tunately for his purpose the avenue is
one of those very wide quiet residen-
tial streets where one is unnoticed

  one other man loitered on the other
side of the street engaged apparently
in reading his morning paper and pay-
ing no attention to anybody a few
children with their nurses came out of
one house and went playing toward the
park

  a few minutes before eleven the door
of the house opened and it did not sur-
prise merrill to see rose come out it
seemed to him that he had expected her
at just about that time two nurses
with two sets of children had come out
before and gone toward the park and
merrill had not been expectant now
he had his handkerchief to his face
lest in spite of his newly grown whis-
kers she should recognize him and he
was sauntering along quite naturally
toward her

  she had glanced carelessly up and
down the street and then had gone
in the direction of the park the other
man he had noticed was on the same
side of the street as rose but he had
shrank back close to the buildings as
she came out and keeping close to
them had started after her

  this complicated matters for merrill
who saw at once that the man was trail-
ing her however he followed along
some distance behind the man studying
him so that he would know him again
he felt that this was in the nature of
a menace to rose

  the man following her took a path
to the left and merrill took one to
the right quickening his steps so that
he might not lose sight of rose whom
he was able to keep in sight either
above or through the shrubbery rose
went leisurely on as if bent only on
a pleasure stroll until she came near
to the old oval pond where she sat
down on a chair which she would pay
a sou for presently and took some
knitting out of a bag which hung over
her arm

  she acted so like a regular habitue
of the park that merrill was puzzled
and wondered if he had made a mis-
take though that seemed impossible
for if he had not seen her face clearly
from where he had stood on her com-
ing out of the house he had been sure
of her from the very curves of her
lithe figure and from a certain easy
graceful sensuousness characteristic of
her

  he moved carefully until he was
near enough to catch a glimpse of her
face when once or twice she looked
up to smile at some of the children
playing near

  guilty of a hideous crime when she
could smile with such heavenly sweet-
ness and when as he could see the chil-
dren stopped for a moment to smile
back at her impossible he sighed
happily he looked about for the man
who was following her and after a
few moments located him behind a for-
sythia his face-an evil one it seemed
to merrill-intent his eyes watching
eagerly

  after a while a sprucely dressed gen-
tleman of fifty perhaps with gray hatr
and mustache came sauntering along
strasbourg rose



from the direction of the batignolles
a newspaper in his hand he avoided
the romping children with a good-na-
tured smile paid no attention to rose
and selected a chair next to her

  there was not a yard between the
two chairs but the newcomer did not
even look toward the busily knitting
girl he opened his paper and at once
became absorbed in it after a while
he dropped the paper into his lap took
a bundle of papers out of the inner
pocket of his coat and with a pencil
made some notes

  while he was doing this merrill
noted that he had the decoration of
the legion of honor on the lapel of
his coat and idly speculating decided
that he was in the employ of the gov-
ernment in one of the numerous bu-
reaus

  when he took up his paper again
he placed the papers on his lap as if
to have them in readiness for more
notes in a little while the papers
slowly slipped off his lap unnoticed by
him in his absorption in what he was
reading

  rose evidently took note of the fallen
papers however for she bent over to
pick them up her bag fell off her
lap and covered the papers she and
the gentleman who had become aware
of what had happened looked at each
other and smiled she fumbled with
her bag extricated the papers and
handed them to him he raised his hat
politely thanked her and at once re-
sumed the reading of his paper

  rose replaced her bag on her lap
and went on with her knitting a few
minutes later the gentleman got up and
went off in the direction of the boule-
vard malesherbes not long afterward
rose replaced her knitting in her bag
and paying her sou to the old woman
in charge started leisurely back home

  if merrill had not been watching
very carefully all this would have
seemed quite unrelated and harmless

but the fact was that he had seen that
one paper out of those that had fallen
had gone to her lap and later very
deftly into her bag with her knitting

  then she was engaged in some sort
of intrigue and all her appearance of
innocence and guilelessness had been
pure acting beads of perspiration
broke out all over him and a sudden
despair settled down on him more-
over although the man spying on rose
had stood behind her he had seen
enough of what had taken place to en-
able him to guess the rest merrill was
sure of this because he had seen the
mans eyes snap with ferocious joy

  but the other man merrill sud-
denly realized that if he would pene-
trate the cloud of mystery he must
gather up every thread and follow each
one to its conclusion he knew where
to find rose he must know more of
the man

  stunned by the evidence of roses
surreptitious activities merrill had lost
track of time the man might have been
gone a long or a short time he would
make the effort to find him anyhow
he dared not risk attracting attention
by running but he walked briskly
through the short avenue velasquez
to the boulevard malesherbes and
looked up and down it there were
few persons on it so that it was pos-
sible for him to see a long distance
and he was sure that he saw his man
near the junction of boulevard hauss-
mann strolling along jauntily

  he quickened his pace and was near
enough to identify his man before the
latter turned into rue roquepine he
followed him saw him turn into rue
cambaceres and there enter a large
building he passed and read the in-
scription on the building it was the
ministry of the interior merrill
wanted to shut his eyes to the hideous
possibilities of this discovery if rose
had secret relations with some one in
official position then it seemed as if
no

strasbourg rose

she must be a german spy and a mem-
ber of that organization that continued
to successfully defy the power of the
french secret-intelligence department
and it was done by corrupting french-
men in official position

chapter xii

lie walked slowly back toward the
parc de monceau why con-
cern himself any more about rose
daimeyrac  had he not set all doubts
at rest had he not seen enough to
know that she was engaged in some
nefarious enterprise

  no he had not seen enough what
he had seen only added to the mystery
it is true that she who had been
branded officially as a most dangerous
german spy was walking about paris
with perfect freedom and was engaged
in some doubtful enterprise with a
french official but after all that only
added to the mystery he would re-
main and learn more yet she might
be the most wicked creature in the
world but his heart furiously refused
to accept the verdict of his reason

  i will speak to her he muttered
savagely and her own lips must con-
fess her falseness and even then
he told himself sullenly i shall not
believe the girl who was with me
in belgium is not wicked she is not
false i will wait

  his mind finally made up as to that
as his heart consistently was he walked
through the park and made his way
into avenue hoche by way of the tiny
avenue van dyck he looked at his
watch it was twelve oclock an hour
when rose was almost certain to be
in her apartment at any rate he
meant to take that risk for he knew
definitely now what he would do he
had noticed the yellow bill in front of
the house announcing that there was a
furnished apartment to be let many
of the best houses at that time had

that sign out because of tht numbers
of families that had left paris for the
south driven away before the battle
of the marne when it seemed as if
the germans would surely capture
paris

  he rang the bell and entered by the
little door which was open the con-
cierge came forward she was a sad-
faced little woman who looked as if
the war had taken toll of all she held
dear she looked inquiringly at mer-
rill

  what kind of an apartment is for
rent he asked

  of five rooms monsieur on the
first floor will monsieur wish to look
at it it is a very pleasant apartment
and well furnished

  the little woman seemed glad to talk
to him telling him of two sons killed
at the beginning of the war and of an-
other who was at the front he gave
her sympathy and won her heart by
execrating the germans then he
asked seeminglyidle questions

  the house is full excepting for this
apartment 

  many of the families have gone
south monsieur but they retain their
apartments this belongs to a young
gentleman who is in the service and
whose wife is nursing in one of the hos-
pitals they are not too rich and they
wish to rent if possible monsieur is
married 

  no i am an american newspaper
correspondent and i wish a place-a
quiet place where i can write are
there any children on this floor

  no monsieur you will find it very
quiet here there are children on the
floors above tres jolies enfants who
will not disturb monsieur in the least
the other apartments on this floor
are not occupied then 

  but yes monsieur the one just
across the hall is occupied by madame
lepaire no children

  oh an old lady
strasbourg rose

in

  the concierge smiled afais non
monsieur very far from that she is
young and-she lifted her hands and
widened her eyes-tres charmante if
monsieur takes the apartment he will
perhaps see her some time and he will
agree that she is lovely and so sweet
and good and gentle her husband
is in the aviation ah poor girl if
she had not such good friends who
come to console her she would be very
lonely she keeps a smiling face but
i have seen tears

  she has been here a long time then
since you know her so well

  but no monsieur a month per-
haps

  perhaps i saw her as i came down
the street-blue eyes and golden hair
a sort of english beauty

  no monsieur she has gray eyes
and brown hair ah such eyes the
red lips can laugh and dimple monsieur
but the eyes they tell me of the sorrow
she hides such a cruel war to sepa-
rate those who love each other mon-
sieur those boches are not human to
have done this

  they will be punished in good time
madame yes i will take the apart-
ment perhaps you know some one
who will make my coffee in the morn-
ing and who will clean up for me
all that can be arranged monsieur
he found that he could give up the
apartment at a months notice so he paid
a months rent and said he would take
possession during the afternoon beg-
ging her to have it aired and dusted for
him

  it seemed that fortune which had
been unkind for a month was in the
way of making amends he got his
bags and trunk and himself into the
apartment that afternoon without en-
countering rose also he was satisfied
that it was she who occupied the apart-
ment across the wide hall also he
found on examination that through the
keyhole in his door he could see very

well any one who went in or out of
her apartment the hall being fairly well
lighted by a huge skylight at the top
of the staircase well

  he despised himself for his resort
to the keyhole but shrugged his shoul-
ders after all it was no worse than
stealing the name passport and money
of a dead american

  he settled himself in the room near-
est the door and soon found that he
could hear the movements of persons
going up and down the stairs or through
the hall then he gave himself up with
self-scom to his task of spying upon
the girl he loved

  for two weeks he watched through
the keyhole listened through a tiny
crack in his slightly opened door and
followed her when she went out when
she went out in her automobile which
she frequently did in the evening he
was unable to follow her but at least
he had made sure that it was she who
lived in the opposite apartment when
she walked out in the daytime he trailed
her learning to do so with great ex-
pertness when she received visitors
as she often did in the evening he
listened for some revealing word when
they went in or out

  what she did or where she went in
the evening he could neither find out
nor guess in the daytime when she
walked it was usually to go to the park
and knit at such times she would
sit in the same place as where he had
first seen her but at no time did any-
thing happen excepting that she was
always shadowed by the same man he
had seen the first time he was sure
however that she was there for a pur-
pose for she would sit and knit and
smile at the children for a certain length
of time-about half an hour-and then
go back home

  at other times she would walk the
length of the avenue du bois de bou-
logne as if for exercise and then back
to her apartment and there also she


strasbourg rose

was always followed at a considerable
distance by her shadow who always
turned in time to avoid her observation
and waited at one side of the arc de
triomphe until she had passed into
avenue hoche

  her visitors were of all sorts and
usually several in number at tunes
there were officers evidently on fur-
lough  and he discovered that when
these came there were always parties
of laughing talking ladies who were
admitted as if habitues at other times
there would be sedate men of middle
age but never did these men come when
the officers were there

  the civilians never came when the
officers were there but generally there
were two or three ladies the officers
would be the same for two or three
nights then there would come a new
lot the civilians he learned were
usually the same at any rate some of
them were always the same and once
merrill heard one of these latter on
coming out of the apartment say ach
in a distinctly german way only to be
swiftly checked by a sibilant sh-h

  merrill was sickened at what seemed
plain enough evidence f a system of
german espionage hidden under the
guise of social gatherings his sym-
pathies by this time were hotly with the
allies in spite of his arbitrary treat-
ment by the french authorities but
the terrible thing was that if rose was
a part of this conspiracy then she was
a german spy and if she were a ger-
man spy all that had been said against
her might be true also and worst of
all to him she had only tricked him in
belgium

  he writhed under the force of the
logic but still refused to accept the
conclusion when he was tempted to
he recalled the hours when it seemed
as if she had bared her pure soul to
his eyes sometimes he thought he
would go to her apartment and demand
an explanation he believed he was

entitled to that in view of what he had
done in risking his life for her he
didnt do it however but continued to
spy on her hoping for something to
happen to clear her fearing more and
more that the worst would be con-
firmed

  then one night when she had gone
away early in her automobile leaving
him unable to follow her he walked
dejectedly toward the grand boule-
vard sick at heart tempted as he
often was to tempt fate no longer but
to leave paris and go home he ate
his dinner in one of the cafes and
afterward wandered idly and sadly
about passing the neighborhood of
the folies bergere he impulsively
bought a ticket and went in he had
not been to a place of amusement since
he had come to paris had not been in
a mood for anything of the sort nor
was he now but he was miserable and
discontented and loathed the thought of
going back to his apartment

  he sat the trifling show through
wondering how any one could laugh at
the foolish antics of the men and
women on the stage and when it was
over he walked home indifferent to the
distance as he turned into avenue
hoche from the rue du faubourg-st
honore an automobile passed him he
recognized it at once as that of rose
dalmeyrac and followed it with his
eye until in the dark street he could
see it stop before the house

  he could see a womans figure get
out of the car and saw the car drive
away then as the lonely figure
crossed the sidewalk a man sprang out
of the darkness and a cry broke from
roses lips it was her voice and the
tone was one of fear there was a
swift struggle rose was thrown aside
and the man broke into a run

  merrill had already started to run to
the rescue but as he saw the man
coming toward him he slowed down
into a saunter and waited until the
strasbourg rose

man was almost upon him then with
a sudden whirl of his body he launched
a swift blow that caught the man un-
der the chin and fairly lifted him off
his feet and laid him senseless on the
sidewalk

  an automobile was approaching be-
hind him but he was reckless he
leaned over the man saw an envelope
clutched in his hand and took it from
him then with a glance back at the
approaching automobile he darted
down the street he looked back when
he reached the house and saw that the
automobile had stopped and that some
one had alighted and was bending over
the prostrate man the little door
opened as he looked back and he went
in hoping he had not been seen

  when he reached his room and had
turned on the lights he examined the
envelope it was of very light tough
material and contained paper of a very
flimsy character he turned it over
and over but did not open it for a
hardly defined reason he disliked to
know what the contents were finally
he threw it on a table with a sense of
disgust and went to bed

  in the morning he looked at the en-
velope a number of times as it lay on
the table conscious of an ominous sig-
nificance in it when he had finished
his coffee he walked up and down con-
sidering hesitating then at last
snatched it up and tore it open

  inside was a large sheet of very thin
paper folded many times he un-
folded it and spread it out his heart
sinking as he did so for at the first
glance he saw that it was an elaborate
drawing of fortifications and when
he examined it closely he uttered a
shocked cry and fiercely crushed the
sheet in his hand it was a plan of
the fortifications of verdun

  my god he groaned then it is
true

  he threw the sheet of paper down
and began to pace the room in an in-

 atb

describable distress of mind pres-
ently feeling that he would choke if
he remained there he put on his hat
and overcoat to go out he dared not
leave the paper behind him so he folded
it up replaced it in the envelope thrust
it into an inner pocket and went out
of the house to walk himself into a
calmness he was unable to attain in-
doors

  he went to the bois de boulogne
and walked for hours in the lonely
paths it was not calmness that finally
came to him but a cold hard determi-
nation to end the affair once and for
all

  it was his habit to enter and leave
his apartment with the least possible
sound in order to avoid attracting any
attention from the apartment opposite
and it was in this silent way that he
unlocked his door and went in now
instantly on closing the door he had
a sense of a presence in the apartment
his first thought as he stood still was
that the woman who cleaned his apart-
ment was there but a swift glance
showed him that she had been there
probably at her usual hour

  he listened intently and became
aware of sounds coming from one of
the inner rooms he crept cautiously
forward to where he could see through
a doorway and caught a glimpse of a
mans figure bending over hunting
through a drawer of the bureau in the
bedroom

  he drew back to consider what this
might mean was his identity known
hardly that for this was not the way
the authorities would go about their
work they had only to knock at his
door and say come that would
have been final no it must be that
he had been seen entering the house
last night after taking the paper from
the man

  this man in all probability was mak-
ing a surreptitious visit to recover the
lost paper perhaps he would be an


strasbourg rose

agent of the french secret service per-
haps not in any case he would surely
be armed and if he had no authority
to be there he would not hesitate to use
his weapon

  merrill was in just such a grim mer-
ciless mood as made him wish to cap-
ture his uninvited visitor and to wring
something from him he smiled sar-
donically and placed himself by the side
of the doorway sooner or later the
man must come by him

  he removed his hat and overcoat
quietly and set himself to wait with a
grim patience he had not long to wait
for the man worked expeditiously
opening one drawer after another and
then going to every place likely to be
used as a receptacle for a valuable
paper then with a smothered oath
he came into the next room which
merrill used very seldom and which
showed plainly its lack of usage he
made a swift examination of that room
and entered the next one the one ad-
joining that in which merrill waited
this room he had already searched as
it was one used by merrill to read and
smoke in but he went through it again
then he cursed and came softly
through the doorway and there he
was caught by the throat in a viselike
grip and looked into the cold blue eyes
of a man ready to make him suffer
for the weeks of misery he had gone
through and for the more recent hours
of bitter anguish

  if you struggle or try to get a
weapon hi kill you merrill said in
icy tones and by a sort of instinct he
spoke in german let us go back to
this room and talk

  he backed the man into the room
and the latter realizing that he was
in the hands of one whose strength
was far beyond the ordinary yielded
sullenly merrill still holding him by
the throat with one hand felt over him
and took from his side pocket a re-
volver of the german type then he

pushed him into a low chair and still
keeping his eyes on him backed away
and sat down in another chair the
revolver he held in readiness for use

  now he said you will tell me
what you were doing here

  up to this time the man had not
spoken a word his pale-blue eyes
flitted shiftily about the room only to
return to look into the hard implacable
eyes of his captor

  i came in here by mistake he an-
swered slowly in french

  you will please speak in german
both of us understand it better than
we do french at least we speak it bet-
ter yes i think it was undoubtedly
a mistake what were you looking
for

  the man stared at him without an-
swering what were you looking
for  merrill snapped i saw you
searching for something what was
it v

  the fellow had a cunning evil face
though he was well dressed and had the
superficial aspect of a gentleman a
sneer slowly curled his thin lips i
must have been trying to steal some-
thing he said at last speaking in ger-
man why dont you call the police

  you mean exclaimed merrill un-
derstanding at once that i dont want
the police here any more than you do

  do you was the response and
merrill could see that he was recover-
ing his confidence

  no i dont want to call the police
and dont mean to you will talk with-
out that

  will i

  i think so merrill said coldly
get up and when the man moved
leisurely caught him by the collar and
jerked him to his feet you are mak-
ing a mistake my man he turned
him about and pushed him into the bed-
room lie on your face and as
the man made no movement to obey
he jerked at his collar and knocked his
strasbourg rose



feet from under him if you more

hand or foot youll regret it he said
as he pushed the man flat to the floor

  merrill spoke without heat but with
a sort of brutal hardness that carried
conviction so that while merrill pro-
duced some handkerchiefs from a
drawer the man lay motionless in a
few minutes he had him tied securely
hand and foot then he gagged him

  he looked him over to make sure
that there was little chance of his work-
ing loose then picked him up and put
him in a large closet and locked the
door

  now he said to himself his face
pale and set ill make a call on my
neighbor

chapter xiii

lie mechanically looked to see that
his clothing bore no marks of the
encounter and then went out into the
hall softly closing and locking the door
after him he wished to keep his pris-
oner in ignorance of his departure

  he crossed the hall and touched the
electric button his heart almost
stopped beating as he waited what-
ever came of the interview it was a
momentous one to him a young in-
telligent-looking maid opened the door
and stared at him silently

i wish to see madame he said

  madame is not at home monsieur
the girl said after a moment of hesita-
tion he could see her eyes curiously
note the fact that he wore no hat or
overcoat and he had noted her hesita-
tion

  yes he said sharply madame is
at home and she will see me he
pushed past her and entered the apart-
ment

  but monsieur  the girl protested
in a half-indignant half-frightened
tone

  who is it renee a voice de-
manded from an inner room

  some one i do not know he in-
sists-

   merrill stood silent it was the voice
he knew and loved and although his
errand there was not a friendly one
a tremor shook him he heard the
rustle of skirts and stood erect and
cold

  rose stood in the doorway opening
into the reception hall what is it
you wish monsieur

  i wish to see you on imperative
business madame he answered taking
a step nearer to her

  she uttered a gasp put her hand to
her heart and stepped back staring
at him you she breathed you
they told me you were dead

  they thought so madame may i
see you for a few minutes i shall
not detain you long

  after her first surprise she had
started forward as if to give him glad
greeting but he was so cold and rigid
that she drew back saying in a low
tone but yes monsieur

  she led the way into a little parlor
charmingly furnished and closed the
door so that they were alone then she
turned swiftly on him her gray eyes
full of passionate pleading her slender
fingers locked together oh mon-
sieur you are angry with me you
are grieved and wounded because i did
not recognize you that night oh it
was terrible for me but i could not
help it you must believe me if you
could know what i have suffered for
it and when i was told you were
dead and i thought that in part at
least i was to blame i wished i too
might die you dont believe me

   her distress looked so real the very
accents qf truth were in her voice her
tear-filled eyes were so pitiful that mer-
rill felt his heart soften then he re-
membered how good an actress she
was he remembered the transfer of
the paper in the park he remembered
the map of verdun in his pocket
ii

strasbourg rose

  i would give my soul to believe
you he said hoarsely i refused
steadfastly to believe one word against
you when they told me you had tried
to assassinate general joffre i laughed
at them when they said you were a
german spy i knew it was not true
if every man in france from the high-
est to the lowest had said it it would
not have shaken my faith in you we
had been but a few hours together but
i would have trusted my life and my
honor to you

  they would have been safe mon-
sieur she said humbly quietly wiping
from her cheeks the tears that ran
down them

  you are mademoiselle dalmey-
rac he asked

  yes monsieur just as i told you
you are known as rose of stras-
bourg

  yes monsieur sometimes

  you are a german spy

  she opened her lips to speak start-
ing toward him then turned and flung
herself on a little couch and broke into
violent sobs he looked at her for a
few moments his broad chest heaving
the hard bitter expression melting out
of his face then he went over to her
and knelt beside her

  well he said laying his hand
lightly on her shoulder what does it
matter why should i judge you
each one plays his part in the world
for one reason or another i played
my poor part because i learned to love
you in those wonderful hours we were
together in belgium wonderful for
me at least everything said against
you to me was a calumny every one
knows that everything is fair in war
so it was fair to make a mock of me
and i have no right to ask for consid-
eration when you are working for your
country only-he laughed in a way
of self-scorn-i wish you hadnt acted
so well with me now i will say

good-by and take myself out of your

life

  she turned and leaped to her feet

stretching out her hands toward him
the tears streaming down her cheeks
her sobs catching her as they would a
child oh no no she cried i
cant let you go like this i was not
acting in belgium i was not

  it was heartbreaking to see her like
this merrill sighed and shook his
head sadly he spoke gently without
anger there is nothing i wish so
much to believe but how can i if
you were a german spy then you were
acting will you assure me that you
are not a german spy

  oh please please trust me she
wailed

  it is not altogether a question of
trust mademoiselle i am not saying
whether you should or should not be
a german spy it is not my business
to judge you if you had come to me
in france and asked me to help you
i would have done it as i helped you
in belgium it is true that my sympa-
thies are all with france but this with
me is a personal matter if as a
french spy you had tried to assassi-
nate a german my feeling of horror
would be the same but even that is
not what concerns me most we were
thrown together in such circumstances
that the ordinary barriers to acquaint-
ance were beaten down and i loved you
it would not be your fault that i loved
you if it were not for many little things
you did that made me love you and
which you need not have done merely
because i was risking my life to aid
you as i thought if you were what
you then pretended to me i would have
the right to believe that you were not
acting but were what you seemed if
you were a german spy then however
you were only deceiving me working
upon my heart and upon my feelings
to gain your ends you had the right
to do this no doubt but my suffering
strasbourg rose

has not been lessened because of that
now that i have satisfied myself that
i was only your plaything i can leave
you and try to forget that you ever
existed i shall do nothing to expose
you here but will leave you to your
own devices

  once more he turned to go his heart
wracked by the sight of her distress
though he could not tell whether it was
real or feigned but before he could
reach the door she had flung herself
in front of him crying passionately
no no you shall not go until you
have heard me i must accept your
judgment of me whatever it may be
but some things i can say and you
must try to understand i may be a
clever spy i may in some things be
as infamous as you believe i may be
a good actress but i swear to you by
all i hold most sacred that i was not
acting or pretending in belgium so far
as you were concerned you say you
loved me her voice softened and her
full under lip trembled and from-her
tear-filled eyes came a pleading look
that shook him well i admit that
i wanted you to love me she wiped
her eyes and looked down you were
the noblest the bravest and the best
man i had ever met i-i thought you
loved me and as i say i wanted you
to love me i was proud and happy
to think you did but i did not try
to make you love me i did no acting
if i did anything to increase your love
it was involuntary it was because-be-
cause i loved you oh wont you be-
lieve that she pleaded

  oh my god he groaned i want
to believe it but how can i  and how
will it serve you he demanded with
a sudden roughness bom of his pain
to have me believe it i am not go-
ing to interfere with you here i am
going to leave paris at once

  she went nearer to him and put her
hand softly on his arm i am not
afraid of what you will do she said

trying to smile all i ask is that you
will trust me in the face of every-
thing

  are you a german spy be de-
manded curtly

  can you not love me if i am she
asked softly

  i suppose i cannot help loving you
whatever you are he answered sav-
agely but if you are and i believe
you are then i hope never to see you
again

  and if i swear to you that i am

not

  he pushed her hand off his arm in
that cas i must tell you that i know
of your relations with the traitor in
the ministry of the interior

  and if i still say i am not a german
spy she asked after a little start that
he could not fail to notice

  then mademoiselle i must tell you
that i have the map of verdun which
was snatched from you last night

  at that she started back with a cry
of dismay you you have it it
was you who took it from me

  no i took it from the man who
took it from you

  and you have it

  i have it in my pocket he placed
his hand over it

  he was watching her keenly and
saw the expression of dismay give way
gradually to the bewitching smile of
glee that he knew so well and had loved
so well indignation surged up fiercely
in his breast at this evidence of her
ability to play any part she chose he
put out his hand to push her aside

  no she said smiling up at him
you are not going you shall sit down
and listen to me monsieur yes and
she put her two hands on his breast
and tried to push him back oh but
you are strong she laughed when
she found that she was powerless to
move him come then sit down be-
cause i beg of you

  no he said i am going but i
ii

strasbourg rose

am going with less pain now that you
have shown me how easy it is for you
to play a part they told me you were
a wonderful actress mademoiselle he
added scornfully and i knew that for
i had seen you with general von schil-
ling and just now it was with diffi-
culty that i kept myself from believing
you yes i almost believed i am not
sure i did not believe that you were
telling the truth when you said you
loved me yes you are wonderful and
i congratulate you mademoiselle on
your remarkable gift

  she looked up at him with eyes that
were still wet with tears but she only
laughed softly it is no wonder i
love you she murmured the laughter
dying on her lips you are so honest
and true yes i am a good actress
but i have not been acting with you
now or ever and you will sit down
and listen to me

  so that you can get the map from
me he demanded roughly it is un-
necessary take it after all why
should i meddle in the affair here
it is let me go he held out the
envelope to her

  she took it and thrust it into the
bosom of her dress but instead of mov-
ing aside she smiled again into hi face
but this is not all i want please you
have something yet that i must have
and will have no matter how hard you
struggle

  well he asked unsmiling what
is it

  i want your trust and confidence
and i mean to have them please
dear she pleaded softly you will
be so sorry you were obstinate when
you have listened to me please dear

  he trembled violently as the caress-
ing word fell on his ear he wanted
to rush from the room reviling her but
deep in his heart was even yet the hope
that she could explain he knew he
could no more refuse to listen to her
than he could bring himself to strike

her she saw him yield and with a
low laugh caught one of his hands and
pulled him to the couch

  she forced him gently down and put
her hand on his shoulder for the
first thing she said you must look
into my eyes and seek the truth there
no not with that cold hard expres-
sion you cannot see my soul with ice
on your eyes dear look as you
looked a few times in belgium no
can you not do it yet there is no
trust left not even your love can
bring that back you do love me
he had never listened to such notes
of tenderness in his life he shook
as with the ague he looked into her
eyes despairingly oh rose he
groaned i would give my soul to be-
lieve you

  you shall believe me she said
you will not doubt when i have told
you what i have to tell see i will
sit here opposite to you and you can
look into my eyes and be sure she
drew a chair to within a short distance
of him and sat down i was distracted
when they said i must not tell you i
told them that you were true and loyal
i even said i loved you but the matter
was so important that they would not
let me even see you again when they

read the document i carried-

  but you carried none he sighed
oh yes i did it was on my shoul-
der and needed only a chemical to bring
it out

  that is the truth  he cried

  look into my eyes

  he looked and covered his face with
his hands in spite of himself he found
himself believing and with it the won-
der came if she were only once more
beguiling him with her witchery

  there was something i could do
that no one else could do as well and
for the sake of bleeding stricken
france i crushed back the cry of my
heart and consented there was no
attempted assassination that was a
strasbourg rose

device to establish me with the german
spies in france there is a nest of
them here who they were and how
they obtained their information was
suspected but not known but the
secret service had the means of intro-
ducing me into this nest i wont go
into details but these spies are many
of them bom french men and women
receiving huge sums from germany
they are doing everything from cor-
rupting our men and officers to making
traitors of men in the various govern-
ment departments you know of the
man in the ministry and you know of
this map you see how desperate the
need was of some one to trap them
it seemed that i was the one best fitted
for the service do you believe nowt
he had listened in breathless silence
now he looked hungrily into her eyes
and the conviction that had been grow-
ing with her words of explanation re-
solved itself into certainty when he
looked into the great gray eyes that
were luminous with truth and sincerity

  he reached out hesitatingly and took
her two little hands in his can you
forgive me he asked

  there is no need for forgiveness
  and you do love me

  with all my heart and soul

  he leaped up and caught her to his
breast and strained her to him without
a word and she with a sigh of con-
tent laid her head on his breast where
she could feel the violent beating of
his heart for a long time he held her
trying to realize that he was at peace
once more with the girl he loved then
he lifted her face and put his lips to
hers

  you will never doubt me again
dear she whispered

  never

  i thought you were dead she mur-
mured and after that i didnt seem
to live but was only playing a part
but you are alive and i have told you
what i should not have told but for

that i do not care i could not let you

go away and when i found you knew
so much i made up my mind to tell
you everything ah if i could tell
you how happy i am 

chapter xiv

it was easy enough for him to see how
happy she was for she talked gayly
and freely with the beautiful abandon
of a child she answered all his ques-
tions and he noted that she did not
ask him to keep secret the things she
told him he spoke of it

  but dearest she answered why
should i ask you that  i trust you ab-
solutely i know that what i tell you
is safe i will have to explain to the
chief-he who sent you away-and per-
haps he will be angry but i cannot help
that now tell me about yourself dear
how did you make them think you
dead tell me

  he told her that and about his sub-
sequent search for her and how he ac-
cidentally found her and then took the
apartment opposite hers

  it is you who live there she cried
i have wondered many times but it
did not trouble me because it did not
matter i know i am followed every-
where by some one these french
traitors have their spies the govern-
ment has its spies and the germans
have theirs i knew well enough that
i was watched that morning you fol-
lowed me to the park but you see it
did not matter what surprises me is
that the government spies have not dis-
covered you ah i am glad you came
to me for now i will beg the chief to
let you remain but to think that you
have been so near to me and i did not
know it

  her surprise at this singular circum-
stance was so full of implications sweet
to a lover that demonstration of some
sort became necessary and as she was
sitting by his side the natural demon-


strasbourg rose

stration was as easy as it was delight-
ful

  ah she sighed when at last he
released her i am behaving like an
american girl and not at all as trench
girls do but i like your american
ways now go on with your story
how did you get the map of verdun
he related the circumstances and
she interrupted once to say it was a
piece of good fortune since the map
was an important item in the rooting
out of the german spies she was
puzzled when he told of the man he
had caught in his apartment and had
left there

  describe him please

  he did so with so much detail that
she cried out he is one of the ger-
man spies he lives in this house but
why did he go there without letting me
know that has a meaning

  what shall i do with him  i could
turn him over to the police

  no she said frowning if you
were to do that it might interfere with
our plans but why did he go there
without first letting me know some-
thing is going on that i do not under-
stand but never mind the chief
will attend to that i think you would
better let him go he is watched all
the time

  perhaps i could make him talk
though i must admit i hadnt much suc-
cess at that

  no you could get nothing out of
him but i am troubled it seems as
if something has gone wrong since i
was not consulted you see this map
of verdun is really only a trap we
know that the germans have their eyes
on verdun and mean some day to try
to take it they have spent large sums
trying to get a map of the fortifications
this map is correct in many particulars
-particulars that they already know-
but in the parts they do not know it is
false so that if it is used it will mislead
them do you see dear

  yes i see what a tangle of in-
trigue 

  it is the chiefs idea he is amaz-
ingly clever he is using their spies
to fool them now i was to take this
map through the lines to-night and de-
liver it to a man who was to meet me
take it through the lines you
but my dear isnt that terribly danger-
ous 

  she shrugged her shoulders sadly
yes it is dangerous for many reasons
i may be shot by my own countrymen
i may be suspected any time by the
germans it is dangerous work but
what would you some one must do
it and i who know german as well as
french i who have the confidence of
the french traitors and of the german
spies i who know the country between
here and alsace-lorraine as i know
this apartment am the one chosen by
fate

  but he cried indignantly it is not
a girls work it is work for a man
they have no right to employ you in
this way

  it is for france dear because i
am a girl there is little else that i could
do so i am glad to do this they say
i do it well and of that i am proud
it is distasteful yes but is not every-
thing connected with war horrible
he looked at her for a few moments
you say you go to-night

  i start this afternoon that is why
dear i felt i must tell you the truth
so that you would understand

  because you fear some extra hazard
this time

  because each time i go the risk in-
creases the germans are clever and
are not easily fooled i have taken
them much important information and
they believe in me but always there
is the chance that they will find out
how do you go

  by automobile she smiled wanly
the germans supply the automobile
and the papers to get me through the
strasbourg rose

xi

lines these papers are partly genu-
ine and partly forged oh the whole
thing is such a network of intrigue and
it is so well hidden that it is appalling
and poor france as if she had not
enemies enough outside has many in-
side there are even some high up
whom we have not caught yet

  you feel that you must make this
venture

  but yes dear she answered
sweetly but with a finality that left
nothing to combat

  then i am going with you

  you oh my darling but that
cannot be

  it shall be do you think i have
found you to let you slip out of my life
now  suppose this should be your last
adventure would you not rather the
end came in my arms

  that would be the sweetest end that
fate could deal out to me but it can-
not be dear it has all been planned
in detail and i must do as i have been
told

  you have seen me in danger can
you not trust me

  more than any one in the world
you are the bravest the coolest the
cleverest man in the world but it is
not for me to say

  who decides 

  the chief

  who drives you

 a german spy i think he is
french born too

  listen to me my darling i have
eaten my heart out in anguish and de-
spair all these weeks i believed you
false and unworthy and still loved you
now i have not only found you and
know that you love me but i have
learned that you are all that i ever be-
lieved you do you think i will let you
go without me  no no no i you will
give me a little note to your chief i
will go to him and tell him everything
i will enlist under you i will put my-
self at his disposal i speak french

and i speak german he will let me
go with you

  he spoke with passionate earnest-
ness she watched him with something
like adoration in her eyes and when
he had ceased to speak she threw her
arms about his neck if only it might
be dear she murmured if only it
might be i am afraid this time
whether it is because you have come
back to me and i dread losing you or
because the danger is real i cannot
tell but i am afraid if i had you
with me i could smile all the way and
laugh in the face of death yes i will
give you the note and you shall tell
him the whole truth i dont need to
tell you not to be afraid of him as most
men are for you are afraid of no one
dont i know that yes yes we will
try it you will leave that spy in your
apartment and let the chief decide what
to do with him you will go at once
dear for now you will find him at the
bureau where you saw him before he
is not always at the same place

  she wrote a note quickly you may
read it if you like dear but i think
it will be better if you dont know what
i have written

  you know best dearest seal it

  she sealed it and handed it to him
and then threw herself into his arms
where he held her close kissing her
hair and her eyes and her lips before he
could tear himself away

  find out if you can if you are
followed she warned him if you
are do your best to elude whoever
it is

  being warned he had no difficulty
in discovering that he was followed
and as little difficulty in evading his
shadow having accomplished this he
slipped down into the metro and in a
very few minutes was in the cite

  as he saw by examining the en-
velope it was addressed to colonel ie
brun a person quite unknown to him
by name also he saw a peculiar mark


strasbourg rose

in one comer of the envelope which
he easily guessed to have some signifi-
cance he was confirmed in this con-
jecture when having penetrated as far
as the large anteroom he gave the en-
velope to an attendant for he saw him
study the envelope give a swift second
glance at him and then hasten away

  a few minutes later the attendant
returned and ushered him into the pres-
ence of the same grim officer whom he
had seen there on the occasion of his
previous visit

  have you read this note monsieur
was the curt demand

  no monsieur le colonel

  the officer was in civilian clothes
but merrill knew he had made no mis-
take in giving him the title the well-
remembered steel-gray eyes seemed to
bore into him but he returned the look
with composure the colonel pushed
the note toward him read it

  merrill took it and read it through
it was brief the gentleman who will
present this to you by chance became
possessed of a part of that which i am
doing i have confided the rest to him
i know i had no right to do this but
perhaps when you have heard what he
has to say you will forgive me he
is the very spirit of loyalty and cour-
age and i hope you will permit him
to do what he wishes

  merrill smiled faintly as he refolded
the note and replaced it on the table
her tribute to him made him happy

  have i seen you before the colo-
nel demanded suddenly

  yes monsieur le colonel i have
been here before i am that doctor
merrill you once sent out of france
ah grunted the colonel and leaned
back in his chair silent for a moment
studying his visitor yes i recognize
you now-your eyes do you know
that you are a very bold man well
tell me what you have to tell

  merrill who had been standing all
this time looked around coolly mon-

sieur le colonel he said i wish to
propitiate you and to win your good
will but if i am permitted to sit down
i shall feel less as if you wished to
humiliate me

  the faintest of smiles flitted over the
stern face yes he answered i re-
call you now perfectly please be
seated your story how come you
to be in france

  merrill drew up a chair and plunged
at once into his story the colonel
interrupted occasionally to ask a ques-
tion but for the most part listened in
silence always studying the speaker
when merrill had finished the colonel
was silent for a while looking at his
desk and lightly tapping it with his fin-
ger tips

  do you know monsieur he de-
manded suddenly that you took your
life in your hand when you returned
to paris and meddled in this affair
france is in no mood to condone con-
duct which may injure her so vitally

  as for that monsieur le colonel
replied merrill steadily you must re-
member that since doctor merrill was
dead his life could not be in my hand
moreover it is only just that you should
bear in mind that i knew nothing of
these things that i know now i knew
only that the woman i loved had been
monstrously defamed and i took the
chance that went with discovering the
truth now i am here to beg you to
make use of me in this enterprise
mademoiselle will be in danger and i
beg of you to let me accompany her
it is true that i have pitted my poor
wits against yours but it was in no
spirit of wantonness but only because
of an anguish of mind which you can-
not understand unless you have loved
a woman as i love mademoiselle dal-
meyrac also i beg you to know that
i love france and will loyally do my
best in her service

  i have the power and the right to
have you shot as a spy monsieur
strasbourg rose



  you have not the right because you
know i am not a spy you knew noth-
ing of me until i came to reveal my-
self

 the colonel without answering
pushed a button and almost immedi-
ately a door at the back of the room
opened to admit a small insignificant-
looking man

  laroque said the colonel what do
you know of this man

  he is monsieur richard lowell an
american newspaper correspondent
who does not correspond he lives in

avenue hoche in an apartment-

he stopped and looked inquiringly at
the colonel

  go on everything

  he lives in an apartment opposite
mademoiselle daimeyrac on whom he
has been spying for some time he
was to have been arrested this evening
in order to make sure that he would
not interfere with our plans

  this man laroque is doctor mer-
rill the american who was sent out of
erance the colonel said coldly

  laroque stared at merrill with man-
ifest chagrin but doctor merrill was

reported-

  as you see he is very much alive
did you know that he had become pos-
sessed of that map of verdun

  no monsieur le colonel gasped
laroque i knew it had been snatched
from the hand of mademoiselle but our

information was-

  your information was not correct
laroque you must look to it the
map was snatched from mademoiselle
by some one from the interior doctor
merrill knocked him down and took it
from him this morning the german
fritz haase was found by the doctor
in his rooms searching for the map
something has gone wrong

  pardon me while i make inquiries
exclaimed the greatly perturbed la-
roque bowing and hastening from the
room

  you see said the colonel when they
were alone again your life was in
danger if you had been arrested i
dont know what would have saved
you certainly not the revelation of
yourself

  i see that i am a child at this game
monsieur le colonel but does it follow
that i might not serve you well in some
other way i think no one would try
harder than i if i might be permitted
to accompany mademoiselle

  i believe you monsieur neither
your loyalty nor your courage nor your
ability are now in question i ask my-
self in such a case who is the fittest
it may be that you are if you are you
shall go with mademoiselle dont
thank me monsieur i am not serving
you either as man or lover i serve
france and france alone if it were
better for france that you should die
then die you should though the heart
of mademoiselle whom i admire and
respect profoundly were to break i
tell you this so that we may understand
each other

  you have made yourself clear mon-
sieur le colonel merrill answered
coldly if i can serve myself and
france at the same time you have the
added guarantee of my devotion and
loyalty

  you are a brave man doctor mer-
rill and as one man to another i beg
to grasp hands with you

  both grim faces lighted up as they
clasped hands thank you monsieur
le colonel said merrill forgive me
if i have put my personal affair too
much in the foreground and dispose
of me as you will for the good of
france i make no reservations
good good cried the colonel
now at last we understand each other
we are troubled by traitors as well as
by spies these traitors are powerful
and havemeans of information that en-
able them to safeguard themselves
that explains what happened last night


strasbourg rose

they had stolen the map from the war

department-a false map of course-
and had given it to mademoiselle
later for some reason they were
frightened and stole the map back from
her why did they steal it back and
not ask her for it did they suspect
her why did the german spy search
your room without notifying her did
they suspect her these are things we
dont know but must find out

  laroque entered the room while they
were speaking and stood waiting at
a sign from the colonel he said the
traitors have received some informa-
tion which disturbs them the german
spies also they are very much dis-
turbed it looks as if mademoiselle is
suspected

  yes that is probable laroque the
traitors must not be touched but you
will see that the spies are gathered in
it is a pity since we were not ready
lesbin was to drive mademoiselle i
believe

  yes monsieur e colonel

  how does he compare in appearance
with monsieur le docteur will you
please stand up monsieur

  merrill stood up and laroque studied
him very much the same excepting
in the face lesbin wears no beard
and he has light hair

  pere francois could arrange that
no doubt 

  but yes he could do that easily
monsieur le docteur speaks german
lesbin is a saxon and speaks german
like a peasant

  my german is good merrill said
and if i could hear this man speak i
do not doubt i could imitate him suf-
ficiently well

  that can be arranged said the
colonel you will see that the spies
are brought here quietly laroque
they are simply to disappear you un-
derstand there must be no warning
to the others that we leave at liberty
it is important

  yes monsieur le colonel

  you will take lesbin and monsieur
le docteur to pere francois and explain
what is desired you monsieur will
have there the chance to hear lesbin
speak see that he speaks in german
laroque monsieur le docteur is to
drive mademoiselle can you drive a
mercedes monsieur

  perfectly well

 good now laroque you must
get into communication with mademoi-
selle and tell her that monsieur le doc-
teur will drive her

  mademoiselle renee is here mon-
sieur le colonel

  i might have known mademoiselle
would think of that send her in here
by the way fritz haase is in mon-
sieurs apartment in a closet i think
you said monsieur

  in a closet off the bedroom
laroque went out and renee came
in merrill to his surprise recognized
her as the dull-looking maid of all work
who took care of his apartment she
was totally unlike the alert bright-eyed
maid who had admitted him to roses
apartment he realized how thor-
oughly he had been under surveillance

  you have met before the colonel
said with a slight smile this gentle-
man renee is to drive mademoiselle
to-night please tell her

  yes monsieur le colonel renee
answered bowing and smiling at mer-
rill then turned a serious face to the
colonel it is very sure monsieur le
colonel thatmademoiselle is suspected
perhaps it will not be safe for made-
moiselle to go

  unfortunately she must go renee
we will see that no one goes through
from here to warn the boches so that
if they do not already know she will be
as safe as usual

  yes monsieur le colonel she
bowed and went out

  now monsieur le docteur i will
explain the situation mademoiselle
strasbourg rose

i

dalmeyrac is the only one who can
do this so i send her although the dan-
ger is undoubtedly great the boches
on the other side may also know that
she has duped them we must chance
that if it were only to get the false
map of verdun into their hands it
would not be worth the risk but she is
to meet one of our own spies who has
information of the greatest value to us
she knows the country perfectly and
can guide you you have a weapon 
only this which i took from the

spy

  you are accustomed to weapons
i am a good shot with a pistol and
fair with a rifle but i must tell you
that i have never shot at a man
yes it is different but you have
iron nerves and you will shoot well
if you must i will give you two good
american automatics you have heard
enough to convince you that the risk
is terrible and yet i trust you mon-
sieur since you are willing to under-
take it you will not be the less effi-
cient because it is mademoiselle you
are to guard ah he sighed show-
ing the first sign of weakness is it
not horrible that we are compelled to
endanger such a beautiful spirit as
mademoiselle i can only say this to
you monsieur that if she were my own
daughter i would send her just the
same if you could realize frances
danger you would understand

  if i do not understand monsieur
le colonel at least i am content since
i shall be there to protect her

  the colonel silently thrust out his
hand and merrill grasped it firmly
the two men at last understood and
liked each other

chapter xv

at five oclock that afternoon mer-
rill a very complete counterfeit
of lesbin stopped his car in front of
the house in avenue hoche it was

already sufficiently dfm so that noth-
ing but a very careful and close in-
spection of him would have betrayed
to any one that he was not the dull
boor he pretended to be

  merrill had no illusions about the
character of the present adventure he
knew that it would be almost by a
miracle that he would ever return with
his precious passenger but it  seemed
to him that death with rose would be
joy in comparison with the misery of
his recent weeks moreover he was
grimly determined to protect rose at
any cost and to return with her if it
were humanly possible

  he had had several hours in which
to think the matter over and he had
ended in identifying himself with the
french utterly he was undertaking
the adventure as a frenchman and
there was something exalting in the
thought of sharing this peril with the
woman he loved

  rose came out almost immediately
upon his stopping in front of the house
she said nothing to him but took her
place in the tonneau as she might have
done rf the real lesbin had been in the
drivers seat out of the corner of his
eye merrill saw that she was enveloped
in a long cloak that almost swept the
ground

  having been instructed as to the gate
by which he should leave the city mer-
rill without hesitation started the car
turned the first comer and then struck
into the boulevard haussmann noth-
ing was said between them until after
their papers had been examined at the
porte dallemagne and they were pass-
ing through pantin then she leaned
forward and put her ungloved hand
on his cheek

  mon amif she murmured

  he caught her hand and pressed it
to his lips this was all until they had
passed the last fortification and were
speeding through the open country
then she leaned over and with her cheek


strasbourg rose

on his said if you will stop dearest
i will get out and take my seat beside
you for a while it will be safe here
and i wish to talk with you

  in a few moments the change was
made now go slowly for a while so
that we may talk

  ah he said with a sigh of deep
satisfaction this is better than when
i was a general and you a gefreite in
the german army

  yes she answered sighing too
but alas dearest it is quite as dan-
gerous or will be later you know
all about it 

  i know you are suspected and that
we may have trouble

  and you are reconciled hayden
dear

  it was absurd of him no doubt but
it was the first time she had ever spoken
his name and the sound of it from her
lips thrilled him i am sorry for the
risk you run but i am reconciled in
the sense that since france demands
this of you i am permitted to share it
with you nevertheless i do not think
it work for a woman

  ah my dear she answered in
these days there is no distinction be-
tween frenchmen and frenchwomen
if you knew as i do the peril france
stands in from enemies within and ene-
mies without if you knew the desperate
struggle she is making for very exist-
ence you would realize that every one
who can help must help you cannot
tell from the surface of things how the
war is going france needs the help
of all-man woman and child i can
help so i do

  i too have thrown in my lot with
france dear what i can do i am
prepared to do

  she leaned softly against him we
hve done a more difficult thing to-
gether she said we will do this i
will tell you what we have to do you
know we have more than one hundred
and fifty miles ahed of us 

  yes they told me that

  we go to an old chateau which be-
longs to a cousin of mine he is a
captain in the german army his
mother married a german we were
both alsatians you see when the war
broke out we went our separate ways
i should tell you dear-please do not
be jealous-that friedrich and i were
going to be married no i did not love
him i loved no one until i saw you
it was a family arrangement and i
accepted it it seems however that he
did love me

  that was inevitable

  la la mon amir she laughed but
it is sweet to have you say it i say
friedrich and i wvent our separate
ways but friedrich who like all ger-
mans is very clever in some ways is
also very stupid in others he could
not understand how dear france was
to me and it was he who suggested to
me that i should be a spy-a spy for
germany he took it for granted that
germany must win and also he never
doubted that i would be his wife
well i saw my chance to help france
and i pretended to agree that was
how i came into this work i was al-
lowed to escape into france and since
then i have lived in paris and have
made three visits to strasbourg the
last one was just before i met you i
was carrying that document on my
shoulder and discovered that i was
suspected that is why i made my way
behind the lines into belgium the
rest you know the pretended attempt
to assassinate joffre was to rehabilitate
me it seemed very foolish to me but
at least it succeeded and i was able
to take up my work again in paris
oh my dear he sighed and
you only a girl

  yes but you see i have done a great
deal after all i have not dared to
venture back into strasbourg but i
have been to the chateau twice and have
carried back veiy important informa-
strasbourg rose



tion you see i take information-of
no value-to the germans who meet me
there but i am always met by a french
spy-an alsatian-who meets me be-
fore the germans come it has been
very successful until -now now it
seems i am suspected again but
whether the suspicion was bora in
paris or on the other side is what we
do not know

  but if on the other side then you
are putting your head in the lions
mouth

  yes but we must try to beat them
even then we must be at the chateau
two hours if possible ahead of the
time set for me then our spy will
have time to deliver his information
and perhaps to let me know if i am
suspected

  you speak of this very calmly
dearest but at the best it is a terrible
risk

  i speak calmly because i must be
cool and calm besides the risk may
not be as great as it seems this
chateau belongs to friedrich von
sturm my cousin it was his mothers
and there as children we spent many
happy days it is very old and very
large and has secret places that few
but friedrich and i know it is be-
hind the german lines it is true but
the lines are thinly held and to one who
knows the roads as i do it is not diffi-
cult to get to it unseen

  but the car will be heard

  the car will be heard but no one
will notice because after we are once
through the german lines-and there
will be no trouble about that-no one
will trouble us you see the chateau
stands within the forest the forest of
woevre and is even now very lonely
my dear he said when she had
ceased to speak i feel very helpless
and i can do nothing but go on blindly
as you tell me

  the stake is great enough dearest
she answered him laying her head

against his shoulder the informa-
tion i shall obtain is enough in itself
and if in addition i can deliver the map
unsuspected then the result will be in-
calculable the germans have their
eyes on verdun and some day will at-
tack it if we can trick them into plan-
ning on false information then we shall
have them in a trap

  oh my dear he said it is a ter-
rible thing to me to be taking you into
this danger but since i have lent myself
to it rather than be parted from you
again we will hope that it will result
happily and we will do our best to that
end in the meantime let us forget that
we are spies and remember only that
we are lovers fate owes us a few
hours of unadulterated happiness

  it is my dearest wish mon ami
she answered softly

  he stopped the car and turned to
her and she divining his wishes threw
herself into his arms and yielded her
lips to him

  the road they took was well back
of the french lines and was sufficiently
good to permit them to rush along for
the most part at a rate of nearly forty
miles an hour the roads seemed quite
deserted and the car being in perfect
condition rolled on without seeming
effort they passed south of chalons-
sur-marne and at about nine oclock
turned northward just before reaching
bar-le-duc from this time on they
were stopped now and again to show
their papers and rose knowing this
would be the case had resumed her seat
in the tonneau

  the country grew rougher as they
advanced now and rose whispered to
merrill that they were in the argonne
later merrill was to know that coun-
try better for it was there that the
splendid american boys were to make
history at the time however he was
occupied by the one dreadful thought
that he was carrying the woman he
loved farther and farther into an in-


strasbourg rose

describable peril after they had
passed through the french lines which
was accomplished with so little diffi-
culty that merrill knew that their mis-
sion must be guessed rose bade him
go very slowly

  the roads now were rough and badly
cut up and frequently they heard shells
go screaming over their heads in both
directions they were stopped three
times before they reached the meuse
and at the river were subjected to a
severe scrutiny but rose had a set of
papers for the germans and was per-
mitted to pass finally having crossed
the meuse they put on speed again
although the road was not only rough
but hilly and they constantly passed
through patches of thick woods

  at last they entered a forest so
gloomy that but for their bright lights
they could not have seen a yard in
front of them even there however
rose showed her marvelous familiarity
with the place and directed him with
perfect accuracy presently she leaned
over and bade him stop she had him
turn the car so that it headed in the
return direction and then they alighted
from it the lights were turned out
and they stood in black darkness

  from here dearest we walk rose
said it is about a mile to walk and
the way is very rough here is an
electric lamp for use in case of need

  he took the lamp mechanically and
dropped it into his pocket it seemed
to him that the gloom and the silence
were fairly threatening he turned
suddenly and caught her to him and
held her without speaking and she
clung to him with passionate murmurs
as if the dread of the unknown had
wakened all her terrors then she put
her arms about his neck and kissed him
over and over oh my dearest she
said i should not have let you come

  that had to be he answered
now what comes to one comes to both
but this must be the end for you i

will give myself to france to do and
dare the utmost but you must take no
more risks like this will you promise
me 

  yes i promise this shall be the
last the pitcher that goes too often
to the well is broken at last it would
have to be anyhow for after this i shall
be of no use since i shall be known
for what i am

  thank heaven for that

  they were starting on when rose
stopped one moment dear in case
anything should happen to me remem-
ber that this spot lies exactly south
from the chateau

  do you think i shall return if any-
thing happens to you he demanded
fiercely

  we must think of france dearest
she pleaded at least i must think of
france and you must think of the civi-
lized world for whom france is fight-
ing could we be happy if we sacri-
ficed so many for ourselves  no dear
promise me that if you can get back
and i cannot for any reason that you
will go do you not see

  it was hard for him feeling as he
did about the adventure to make the
promise but he knew she was right
and more than that he knew that his
promise would lighten her load very
well i promise

  she put her hand in his and they
started he could distinguish nothing
-everything was equally black to him
even when his eyes were more accus-
tomed to the darkness-but she went
forward unhesitatingly as if guided by
a sixth sense

  the distant boom of big guns and
scream of shells seemed only to make
the utter silence of the forest more
dismal he did not recall ever hearing
of the place but he knew it must be
of great extent he asked her about it

  oh she answered it is a large
forest-more than fifteen miles long
and as wide in some places-and it is
strasbourg rose



so dense that even in the daytime it is
almost impenetrable an army could
hide in it there was much fighting
here in the days of the french revolu-
tion and in our last war with germany
much blood was spilled here back
where we left our automobile there is
a big stone set up by the roadside to
mark where kellermann beat the prus-
sians in  i think it was when i
was a little girl i always trembled if
i was out in the forest at dusk because
i thought it must be full of the ghosts
of dead soldiers formerly it was alive
with wolves but the only wolves here
now are the germans they are worse
than the real wolves

  he felt her shudder and knew that
a sudden terror had overtaken her he
turned and drew her to him and she
rested on his breast until she was calm
again

  you see she said disengaging her-
self with a pitiful little laugh what
a coward i am

  i never knew a woman could be
so brave he said i learned to know
you in belgium

  ah she sighed pressing his hand
whatever happens i have had your
love i think heaven must have sent
me to you in brussels i was so fright-
ened that day i was sure i could
not escape then i saw you in that
doorway what a blessed moment
and how splendidly you carried me
through that danger i have thought
of you so often always cool and ready
and yet in moments of action there was
something terrible in your calm cour-
age and how strong you are i won-
dered knowing you what you would
do when you were sent out of france
can you guess what i thought dear-
est

  how can i guess beloved

  i did not know but i hoped you
loved me there had been some
glances between us you know

  yes i shall not forget them

  atb

  i knew i loved you but while i
hoped you loved me i was afraid why
should a wonderful man like you love
me and then what they had told you
about me but i kept telling my sad
heart that maybe you did love me and
that if you did somehow you would
find me

  all this was the sweetest music he
had ever listened to and it was small
wonder that when she ceased with a
sigh of wonder and admiration he
should take her into his arms

  i am not what you think my dar-
ling he said but i love you with all
my heart and soul and i do believe
that i should always find you no mat-
ter where you were hidden from me
for that would be my sole object in
living

  after they had walked for less than
half an hour rose stopped him and
whispered the chateau is there in
front of us you cannot see it for
the trees now we must go very quietly
so that no one may see or hear us when
we enter keep dose behind me

  merrill felt to make sure that his au-
tomatics were convenient to his hands
he had one in each side pocket of his
overcoat his heart was beating
quickly for there was something omi-
nous in the sight of the shadowy out-
lines of a great building that suddenly
came into view as they broke through
the trees it was only a confused mass
distinguishable because it seemed
blacker even than the darkness

  rose drew his head down and whis-
pered in his ear do not be startled
dear i am going to call for pierre
pierre is the son of the gardener
here and it is he whom i am expecting
he knows every path in the forest and
can slip through an army here

  she stepped aside and presently
merrill heard the melancholy quaver-
ing call of the owl a deathly silence
followed she repeated the cry in a
few moments there was no response


strasbourg rose

  he cannot have arrived yet she
whispered it is the call we children
used in our play we will go into the
house keep close to me and stoop
as you walk

  he pressed her hand to indicate his
readiness and she glided on in the
shadow of the trees though it seemed
to him that no one could have seen
them if they had walked boldly across
the open space after a little while
she turned toward the building and
crept toward it sheltered by clumps of
shrubs finally she turned into a nar-
row avenue bordered on each side by
box and in a few moments more
reached an open gateway and entered
through it

  this is the servants end she whis-
pered and is the safest way for us
to enter no stranger would know his
way from here

  without waiting for any comment
from him she led him across a grass-
grown courtyard and entered by a nar-
row door into a low-ceiled room
across this she glided like a wraith and
passed through several other rooms of
varying dimensions through narrow
passageways up and down low flights
of stairs until at last she stopped

  this she whispered is the great
dining hall here is where i meet the
german officer who comes for what i
bring

chapter xvi

ait a few moments and listen
rose whispered and then after
a lapse of time i hear nothing
the silence was uncanny i hear
nothing he returned in a low tone

  turn on the electric lamp she said
and he did so the stream of light shot
startlingiy through the thick gloom and
showed a large table in the middle of
a large rectangular room of great
height

  there is a candle with matches on

the table we will light it first that
will show pierre i am here

  there was something weird and
ghastly about the whole proceeding but
merrill held his nerves taut and did as
he was bidden now give me the
lamp rose said and we will go wait
for pierre he should be here but i
suppose he has been detained she
turned the light toward one end of the
great room still only faintly illumined
by the double light of candle and elec-
tric lamp there is the great stair-
way which leads to the guest chambers
here-she turned the light toward the
other end of the room-is the smaller
stairway which leads into the oldest
part of the chateau my aunt and uncle
had their rooms there and there also
are the secret rooms and passages which
were needed in the bad old times we
will go up there and wait for pierre
who always comes by a secret way so
that if there should be any watchers
he will not be seen

  she led the way up the flight of stairs
and through a door into a long corri-
dor at the farther end she opened
the door into a room and entered it
this is my room she said turning the
light so that he might see it

  it was all in disarray as if it had
been rudely occupied and left in its dis-
order but merrill felt a thrill as he
looked about it and saw the evidences
of roses one-time life there

  the germans came here when the
war first broke out not knowing it be-
longed to my cousin it has not been
used since the first month but no one
has had the heart to restore it to order
i saw many happy days here

  she sighed and turned toward a mas-
sive wardrobe that seemed built into
the room she pressed a comer of the
paneling and then pushed the ward-
robe it moved slowly and silently to
one side friedrich and i loved these
secret places and always kept them
oiled pierre does so now come
strasbourg rose



we will go to pierres room and wait
for him

  through a narrow opening disclosed
by the movement of the wardrobe mer-
rill followed her she closed the open-
ing as easily as she had opened it the
passageway was so narrow that merrill
was obliged to turn sidewise to move
through

  it was not long and ended at a small
door which rose opened she still
held the electric lamp the light from
which illumined a small room simply
furnished with a narrow bed a small
table and two chairs almost as she
opened the door she uttered a low cry
of horror and ran to the bed merrill
following closely saw a young man ly-
ing on the bed one leg hanging over
the side as if he had dropped there and
been unable to move afterward

  pierre pierre she moaned as she
stooped over him oh he is dead
they have killed him

  merrill took the light from her and
gently pushing her aside bent over the
boy for he was hardly more he
opened his jacket and instantly saw
a great stain of blood a further ex-
amination however showed that he
still lived

  you have no brandy  merrill
asked

  alas no she answered her hands
clinging together in an effort to sup-
press any audible expression of her
grief is he alive

  yes he is still alive you can get
some water perhaps

  there is some here she brought
him a pitcher of water from the table
is he badly wounded 

  very but he will recover conscious-
ness i think

  he worked over him for a few min-
utes and presently had the satisfaction
of seeing him open his eyes

  pierre pierre she cried kneeling
beside him it is rose

  a glad eager expression lit up his

rugged face and he tried to rise mer-
rill gently restrained him dieu
merci he gasped i was afraid they
would get you too they were waiting
for me but i broke away they shot
me but i got here i am done nest-c
pas but yes i know it who-

who-

  this is a dear friend pierre and a
friend of france he is a doctor too
mon pauvre and he will know what to
do for you you can save him man
ami he is my little playmate and so
faithful and true you can save him
pierre watched merrills face and
then smiled sweetly no he cannot
save me i can see that eh bien it
is for france listen mamselle rose
i have the paper here he tried to
indicate his inner pocket but could only
lift his arm wasnt it lucky the
boches shot me on the other side  you
will see it is not torn or soiled take
it out if you please

  rose winking the tears out of her
eyes felt in his pocket and took out
a folded sheet of thin paper always
so loyal so brave she murmured

  dont cry for me mamselle rose
if i have helped france i am content
he closed his eyes and seemed to be
falling into unconsciousness and then
with a start opened them and tried once
more to rise staring eagerly at rose
pig that i am i was forgetting he
gasped you you mamselle rose
they suspect you they are after you
too fly fly quickly the secret

passage-captain friedrich-

  he fell back dead

  rose looked up at merrill he shook
his head it is over for him dear
he leaned over and straightened the
body and covered it with a sheet from
the bed then he lifted the sobbing girl
to her feet and held her in his arms
saying nothing but showing his sym-
pathy by his tender embrace for a
little while she sobbed then gained her
self-control he was only twenty
strasbourg rose

she said how many games we played
together in this very room he and
friedrich and i i and now he is gone
he died like a brave man dear
and they who killed him are waiting
for you we must go dear

  that is true mon ami we must go
let me think a moment he spoke of
friedrich what did he mean can
friedrich be here oh no no fried-
rich would never have let them shoot
his old playmate

  he may not have known him in the
darkness is there some way by which
we can leave he spoke of a secret
passage did he mean the one by which
we came

  no there is an underground passage
that leads to a cave to reach it we
must go to the cellar here you
take this paper it will be safer with
you now let us go and we must
leave pierre here

  there is nothing else to do dear
and he is beyond all harm now come
no doubt the chateau is surrounded
and they may invade the chateau at
any moment

  they may be here now that can-
dle will tell them i am here back
through my room will be the best way
there is another way-the one by
which pierre came here but that takes
us through the dining hall the cave
is on the north side of the chateau
which makes it more difficult to reach
our car but it is the only way turn
off the light and we will go she
turned and looked at the silent form
under the sheet adieu my brave
pierre

  they went silently through the nar-
row passage rose leading the way
after pushing aside the wardrobe she
stood listening intently before stepping
into the room

  i hear nothing she whispered but
something tells me there are others in
the house

  merrill held the flash light in his left

hand his right grasping an automatic
ready for use whether because of his
knowledge that there were soldiers in
the neighborhood or from a veritable
consciousness he felt as rose did-
that they were not alone in the chateau

  they crept softly across the room
and out into the corridor even there
there was no sound a few paces to
the left rose stopped and whispered
the staircase is here it is inclosed
on both sides and leads to a little private
dining room which we used when we
were here without guests it is unlikely
that any one is there

  they crept down and presently were
in the room below rose closed the
door behind them and then shrank si-
lently close to merrill both of them
had a sudden uncanny sense of not be-
ing alone in the room although there
was no sound

  dont move a voice commanded
in german is that you rose
friedrich she breathed you
here 

  hans light the lamp a heavy
footfall crossed from the other side of
the room and presently a match was
struck and by its light they could see
clearly enough a soldier at the table
with the match two more soldiers
against the opposite wall and on the
same side with themselves an officer

  rose put a little distance between
herself and merrill before the light
from the lamp flared up and revealed
everything clearly

  who is that with you friedrich
demanded curtly

  lesbin my chauffeur

  lesbin oh yes lesbin stand
over there

  merrills wits worked quickly there
were four men against him but if he
played his part properly perhaps there
was a chance yet he dropped his
automatic into his side pocket saluted
in the german manner and stepped
away not exactly to where the captain
strasbourg rose

had indicated but in a spot of his own
choosing

  what are you doing here fried-
rich  rose demanded

  spy catching he snapped i
thought you would come this way after
seeing that traitor up there

  traitor flared rose patriot
and you shot him

  by my orders little cousin

  your old playmate oh yon
brute v

  he was as merrill could see a hand-
some young fellow of perhaps twenty-
three but already a typical german
officer he tried to smile at her words
but it was a snarl that twisted his lips

  always ready with hard names lit-
tle cousin he said i could call hard
names too it seems to me you who
have pretended to serve the fatherland
and have sold yourself to the enemy
but this is the end you will go with
me and we will know how to put an
end to your activities attention  he
snapped at the soldiers one of you
on each side of the prisoner and one
behind

  merrill had watched and listened
every nerve on edge and all the while
an odd questioning was going on within
him would he be equal to the occa-
sion he had caught a glance from
rose but had given no sign for he
had seen the eyes of friedrich follow
her glance

  now his chance had come it was
singular how it should pop into his head
at that moment that he had told the
chief that he had never shot a man
and now he meant to do it in cold
blood he knew his hand had never
been steadier his will more fixed his
conscience more clear he waited till
the men had come to attention and then
had whipped out his automatic and
fired-one two three

  the men threw up their arms and
dropped whether dead or not he neither
knew nor cared he wouldnt hare

counted fifty lives against roses
safety he had been as swift as
thought almost but there had been time
for friedrich to realize what was tak-
ing place and to enable him to draw
and fire his own revolver

  merrill saw the spit of flame as he
turned and pointed his weapon at the
captain he felt a burning sensation
in his left shoulder but his automatic
never wavered and his voice was as
cold as ice as he said drop that pis-
tol or ill kill you drop it

  the weapon dropped from the cap-
tains hand and his face was ghastly
white he looked from merrill to rose
with the air of a trapped rat he
sensed that this could not be the les-
bin he had been told of but yet he
did not understand

  what shall we do with him rose 
merrill demanded i would like to
kill him shall i

  he may not have been in the mood
to do as he said but certainly he looked
it and indeed when he thought of what
this man would have done to rose he
was filled with rage captain fried-
rich had no doubt in his own mind for
a look of terror came into his eyes and
he turned pleadingly toward rose she
shuddered and held up her hand in a
gesture of negation she loathed this
man who had once been a loved play-
mate but she could not see him shot
down no matter what his intentions to-
ward her might have been no she
said let him live

  merrill crossed over to her and ad-
dressed friedrich menacingly you
have more men where are they

  he could see him take a long breath
of relief then he was sure he saw a
shifty treacherous expression creep
into the pale-blue eyes he evidently
contemplated some trick

they are outside friedrich an-
swered but it seemed to merrill that
he was listening and he knew he lied
he is a german therefore a liar
strasbourg rose

said merrill to rose scornfully we
must get away at once which way

  rose looked at friedrich for a mo-
ment yes she said sadly he is ly-
ing and why not  he could kill his
old playmate and he would have carried
me to my death he is not to be
trusted we must take him with us
through that door and she pointed to
a door on the opposite side of the room

  open it merrill snapped in fierce
command and remember that if you
try to play us a trick ill shoot you

  friedrich crossed the room with such
alacrity that merrill suspected him at
once stop he cried and hardly had
the word left his lips when there came
from the other side of the door the
sound of heavy hurrying feet

  this way rose he turned and
opened the door by which they had en-
tered he kept his automatic leveled
at friedrich who had stopped as if
turned to stone you hound he said
hoarsely

  rose sprang through the door and
merrill following closed it after him
they both ran up swiftly but before
they were halfway up the stairs the
door was snatched open and a shot was
fired friedrich had snatched up his
pistol from the floor and had leaped
to the door

  merrill was behind rose but they
were on opposite sides of the staircase
he heard the zipp of the bullet as it
passed him and then a low cry
from rose who almost immediately
stumbled a strangled cry broke from
merrill he turned and fired down
the stairs and then lifted rose and
carried her to the top

  my room she gasped

  he carried her along the corridor
feeling with one hand for the door
when he reached it he threw it open
and entered the room closing the door
behind him and bolting it

  the bullet hit you he said trying
to be calm

  yes dear and i feel very weak
she answered in a low tone in which
there was a note of pain take me to
the wardrobe

  he carried her over to it not daring
to hesitate because he heard the rush
of heavy feet on the stairs she
pressed the hidden spot and the ward-
robe was easily moved aside

  perhaps i can walk she mur-
mured the passage is so narrow

  i can carry you with difficulty
he squeezed through the opening hold-
ing her as tenderly as possible she
closed the opening saying friedrich
knows the secret but i think he wont
come because one man could so easily
defend it oh my love i am-i

am- evidently she had fainted

  he gently placed her on the floor
and drew out his flash light she was
breathing faintly and to his horror
there was blood on her lips he forgot
everything in his anguish but to minis-
ter to her need he leaped to the
pitcher of water and kneeling beside
her wiped her lips and wet her face

  she opened her eyes in a moment and
smiled up at him am i dying dar-
ling she asked faintly

  oh no no he answered passion-
ately i will find the wound and you
will be all right in a little while it
was in the back

  yes dear she smiled again
never mind the wound i know i
shall not live hold me in your arms
hold me close oh my darling how
i have loved you kiss me good-by
she sank limp into his arms he
could feel a faint beating of her heart
but terror seized him he turned the
light to her lips there was a bloody
froth there the bullet had entered the
lung but that need not be fatal he
must examine the wound he would
know how serious it was when he knew
where the bullet had entered he
pulled himself together remembering
that he was a surgeon and that it was
strasbourg rose



his duty to be cold and calm he took
her arms from about his neck and put
her gently down

  suddenly a door was slid to one side
and two men leaped in he made no
attempt to escape or even to shut off
his light they leveled their rifles at
him

  ah came in the sneering voice of
friedrich the tables are turned now
he entered the room

  she is not dead merrill said care-
less of himself i am a surgeon and
i may be able to save her i whl not
try to escape if you will send your men
away so that i may make an examina-
tion

  friedrich made a sign to the men as
he saw merrill look down into the white
face they sprang at him and caught
him one on each side he made no
struggle his mind on but one thing

  do you not understand he said
she was shot in the back and she will
die if she is not given proper attention
i am a surgeon i will not try to es-
cape you dont want her to die

  take him downstairs commanded
friedrich

  merrill kept control of himself he
wanted to leap at the young brute and
choke him but he knew that in a mele
in that tiny rooip rose would be
trampled on what i tell you is true
he said evenly t am a surgeon and
if she can be saved i can do it but
no time must be lost surely you dont
want your cousin to die

  friedrich seeing that merrill was
held by the two men went to rose and
leaned over her placing his hand on
her heart

  she is dead now he said take
him downstairs

  the men stolidly pushed him toward
the opening he must know if she were
dead or not he flung the men off and
leaped to the side of rose and looked
down into her face so still and white
he felt above her heart he could de-
tect no movement

  he looked up at the young captain
to tell him that the evidence was not
conclusive when at a sign already
given by friedrich one of the men
struck him over the head with the butt
of his rifle and he fell senseless over
the body of his love

we must die walter

there is hope

not in this world walter

  i know the danger anita but we
havent been recognized in london

  fanny leland saw me this morn-
ing she knew me im sure she did
for with my veil and all she acted as
if she had seen a ghost anita demar
stretched out her arms as if imploring
safety from the skies but we have
been over this all so many many times
walter and it all comes back to the
beginning no one identifies us but
some one will you can find work
but it all goes black and sordid george
must be here now and that means
prison for you and open disgrace to
me we must end it now while it is
beautiful

  but anita- and there was some

new note of hopefulness in the young
fellows voice that lifted her face from
the hands into which she had let it
droop despondently

  yes walter there was hope in
her voice too

  i met such a fine fellow this morn-
ing an englishman he must have
seen something in my face the fate of

it ail for he asked me if i needed a
friend hed help us

  oh walter and you confided in
him you always do poor dear you
confided in me

  yes he replied the color in his
cheek proving how shrewd her surmise
had been i told him a little i-we
exchanged cards here he added
taking one from his case and reading
 sir john memory good name
isnt it

  oh walter memory there
was the touch of doom in what she

                                                                                                                                                            

said dear we cannot go too quickly
it must be soon here let me have
your cards why didnt you throw
them overboard with the rest

  walter scarsdale handed her the
little leather case with drooping head

  there said the girl-she was noth-
ing more in years-as she dropped it
into the lodgings fire which was the
one bright thing in their london that
day there walter it has to be
your name is on the case

  a long slow silence fell upon them
the end was near at hand a few
hours-well they would still be united

  it was the inevitably tragic end to a
when ghosts walked



romance that had seemed so simple to
the thoughtless luckless pair in new
york so simple to work out and to
live happily ever after walter scars-
dale the son of an old friend was
george demars confidential secretary
anita demar was his wife and a gen-
eration younger in years but demar
worshiped her yet for this untoward
romance he was not blameless he had
married her knowing she did not love
him bringing to bear upon her youth
the pressure of needy kinsfolk the sup-
port of an aging father and mother
the education of her younger brothers
she had been driven into it from her
very lack of experience

  walters and anitas passion was a
conclusion foregone from the first an
infatuation sent by some divine decree
such as the ancients recognized and
tenderly commiserated while the mod-
em world has nothing but scorn and
revilings to wait upon detection

  she was going to europe with
friends a great party of them lon-
don paris the riviera possibly egypt
how much better than the keen ameri-
can winter already begun but mad-
ness was in their blood the madness
the gods send to those whom they
would destroy scarsdale laying his
plans well contrived to have his un-
suspecting employer and friend send
him to england at the same time
investments there demanding the pres-
ence of some one on the spot and
at the last minute the very day the
graustark sailed they changed every
plan rushed to the steamer at montreal
under an assumed name as man and
wife and cut the world from under
their feet

  nor was this all their luggage was
already aboard the graustark scars-
dale remembering the need for new
wardrobes for them both rushed back
to demars office possessed himself of
all the available currency in the vault
and rushed away too late he realized

that in so doing he had severed the
last strand in the web of his former
destiny it was symbolic when with
the solemnity of a rite the couple crept
on deck together their first night out
-oh what a night it was-all that they
had worn from home in a weighted
bundle under mrs demars newly pur-
chased cloak and consigned their part
to the star-lit austere atlantic the
hasty belongings they had gathered in
the canadian capital must suffice them
until they reached london london
attained they must suffice them until
the end

  they arrived in liverpool happy and
unrecognized there is little travel in
mid-december and no one on the ship
susjfected more than that they were
bride and bridegroom in the splendor
of their honeymoon their keeping to
themselves in such circumstances was
entirely natural quite a matter of
course and they were happy oh so
happy even death could not dim that
and it gave them courage to look into
each others eyes and smile now with
death at their elbow

  on the train from liverpool to lon-
don came the beginning of the end
the graustark great and gallant ship
laden with the happiness of hundreds
sank almost within sight of the statue
of liberty an appalling explosion
blew the mighty vessel into fragments
amidships and all the hasty succor on
the sea tugs and yachts harbor boats
and torpedo craft availed only to save
a score of lives an anarchist plot
some powerful explosive in the coal
an infernal machine infernally effec-
tive was the sole conjecture a press
frenzied at the horror of it could
frame

  buying on the dock the papers they
had not seen and had not missed on
their voyage walter and anita had
settled back in the speeding train to
connect themselves tardily with the
world they had deemed well lost the
when ghosts walked

first newspaper they opened had their
names in the fatal list mrs george
dearkin demar and after a long roll
of women both had known walter
scarsdale far down the somber roster
of friends and acquaintances their
dream of future safety vanished in the
thought that a respite had been granted
them-bit what a respite it was a
doom escaped pointing forward to a
doom from which there was no escape
they became on the instant living
ghosts

  they followed with staring eyes the
multiple disaster down through the
week in a diminuendo of accorded
space and on the third day read that
george d demar following his physi-
cians advice had taken ship for lon-
don seeking distraction through travel
from the blow that had almost stricken
him down heavens were ghosts al-
ready half disembodied to be followed
by such a nemesis as the presence and
personality implied

  it had been scarsdales thought to
write from london concerning the
money he had taken that was im-
possible now without betraying the ex-
istence of anita vengeance lay ready
to the hand of a husband and friend
outraged and betrayed and the be-
trayer knew of old that george demar
could be implacable the taking of
the money was turned into a crime
recognition in london meant denun-
ciation extradition a trial in new
york and the penitentiary if he had
had wit enough to leave an acknowl-
edgement of the amount all prospect
of accord would not have been so com-
pletely lost but disgrace for anita
prison for himself he could face
neither they were condemned to die
by the very terms of their living and
loving from the first pallid stare into
the future on that rushing train they
accepted the skeleton hand that held
them in its grasp

  at the station in london they made

appeal to a wise old cabman for a shel-
ter with the worldly knowledge of
his kind he saw in a young woman so
simply clad and heavily veiled and a
tall bearded man with colored spec-
tacles that concealment of identity but
not of intent which prompted him to
his course he drove them far from
the haunts to which their evident sta-
tion entitled them leagues away from
the london they and their kind had
always known and left them outlawed
from civilization

  there in lodgings as comfortable as
contracted space allows ministered to
by an elderly frenchwoman who found
in their youth and grace and palpable
romance momentary forgetfulness of
her own exile they had lived another
week of terror and delight and had al-
ready planned their end in its details
they discovered an excitement like that
in the self-appalling tales of childhood
or in the stories of mystery poe drew
from his melancholy brain for their
tragic purpose there remained just
money enoogh-in the wildness of their
passion that had been too slight a con-
sideration hitherto-for keeping up the
comedy of life until the final curtain
but not enough to secure them even
another week of delights dead to the
world already through the graustarks
calamity aware now of the weight of
the worlds judgment they could
merely plan to go together and go gayly
and without it being known

  in the searching of hearts and weigh-
ing of means that day in the train
walter and anita had decided to live
the year through no more--no more
was possible everything they had had
of intrinsic value was at the bottom of
the ocean sunk with the graustark or
tossed overboard by their own hands
searsdale had thought to find work
but the fear of being confronted by
demar already due in london tore
away that last and feeble resource

  now the last day of sad december
when ghosts walked

i

was come glooming with tempest upon
the metropolis it was already cold
the fire was growing dim burned out
by the gusts overhead walter rose
and mended it the thought of final-
ity in that simple act made them both
turn away and sigh their lives would
be burned out before the replenished
fire went cold at last

  their landlady had asked them for-
tunately enough if they could not wait
upon themselves on this the evening
for which they had announced their
departure she explained that the
new year had too many memories to
permit of her spending it away from
her countryfolk friends and lovers of
la belle france stranded like herself
amid gloomy fogs and grimy snows
a little collation stood without she
begged to inform them as she bade
them good luck and wished them a
happy new year bonne fortune was
theirs already she told herself as she
went out into the storm

  the fire burned bright again and in
its light anita demar sat sewing
changing with deft fingers the evening
wrap and dinner gown bought in mon-
treal until their maker could not have
identified them she went painstak-
ingly over every detail of her ward-
robe and walters making certain that
no mark of the past remained there
was plenty to do though the details
had long been arranged and provided
for a cab was to drive them and their
scanty luggage to kings cross as if
for the night express to edinburgh
another cab would carry them to the
hotel delapole in time for supper after
they had forwarded their effects to the
north

  walter had sought through the pawn-
shops their number attesting the pov-
erty of the neighborhood they were so-
journing in until he found two der-
ringers carrying large bullets effective
perhaps at short range only but terri-
fyingly effective there perhaps it was

the explosion which sank the gratis
stark that brought it to his mind but
he had made that morning an excur-
sion to the west end for the first time
since his arrival securing in a gunshop
there explosive cartridges large enough
to kill an elephant yet fitting these little
engines of destruction perfectly it
was just after their purchase that he
was spoken to by sir john memory
if his reflections showed in his face
he certainly looked as if he needed a
friend

  similarly mrs demar had fallen
under the observation of fanny le-
land when she went to buy the hair
dye that was to change herself and
walter beyond the power of even shat-
tered recognition this had been the
last detail planned and it might not
have been carried out but for the mem-
ory and leland episodes anita no
less than scarsdale was determined to
spend these final moments in a scene
of joy in a spot the very publicity of
which would act as a deterrent to suc-
cessful inquiry

  the pair stood clasped heart to heart
before they went to make the changes
in their appearance they deemed nec-
essary the sigh of an hour before
became a sob as they parted when
they returned to the little sitting room
-the fire had grown dim again-
anitas glorious golden locks were
bronzed to the color of an autumn leaf
walters beard was gone and his au-
burn hair and eyebrows stained dark
brown they laughed at sight of one
another like children preparing for
charades their work was thorough-
they had even spoken of the morgue
where vulgar crowds sought gruesome
pastime and the unhappy fold their
lost hoping as they searched that they
would not be found-there

  both were in evening dress walters
pistols were loaded and extra car-
tridges slipped into his waistcoat pocket
all that was required was nerve enough
when ghosts walked

to pull the trigger once and yet again
and they had thrown themselves upon
the mercy of an hereafter shadowed
indeed but more pitiful than the pres
ent as god most ever be more pitiful
than man the clock struck it was
chilly but what need now to mend the
fire

  he counted over their scanty supply
of money finding just enough to pay
for the cabs the tickets to edinburgh
and a plentiful supper all was done
and the time was short to wait they
sat walter and anita glad of the
duskiness of the room that they might
better remember their real faces talk
went from them and they threw them-
selves into one anothers arras with a
cry never had their love been so
beautiful never life so lovely awd so
precious every carrese had in it the
vigor of a youth that was never to
know decay the full savor of complete-
ness they were at once eros and
psyche immortally young battcis and
philemon mated until the end the
clock struck the half hour the wheels
of the cab arranged for grated on the
cttrb before the door one last impas-
sioned embrace in which their hearts
almost leaped through their breasts that
they might touch and the good land-
ladys collation forgotten they went
hand in hand down the darkened
creaking stairs and forth from the de-
serted and desolate house into the
whistling night

  fate so cruel to them in the grea-t
things smiled on the small every-
thing went as they had planned their
cab drove them to kings cross and
disappeared-they watched it-m the
outer darkness they looked for edin-
burgh and saw their luggage duly sent
on the fools errand to ire unclaimed
until it passed to human ownership
again through auction a second cab
sped them on to the hotel delapole
quiet somewhat remote entirely re-
spectable solemnly fashionable

  they were given a tawe tete-a-tete
in the middle of the farther side of the
commodious room all about them
were parlies decorously joyful eating
and drinking waiting for the new
year to bring them the opportunity to
offer one toast of happiness before the
evening closed there was a hunger
in walters and anitas eyes deeper
than any mere appetite for food the
avid desire for life as it would be lived
by every one else in the place at least
safely into the impending year while
the stroke of twelve spelled for them
a darkness absolute

  they ordered jointly gayly extrava-
gantly each selecting favorite viands
for the other there was no fear of
indigestion they told one another with
smiles that stopped on a sudden as the
comers of their mouths drew down
viand the most delicate wines the
most precious were theirs for an hour
their appetite they jested wanly was
that of condemned criminals notori-
ously voracimis such tonic as they
gained from the good cheer and the at-
mosphere about them was needed it
would not be necessary they noted to
pay for all this though pay they should
of cowse and with their last bill al-
ways the clock its face sustained by
larugfiing cupids ticked away the min-
utes surely mandibfy without chance
for recall it grew near twelve

  walter took out the twenty pound
note remaining to them and laid it to
one side though not until their waiter
passing to the table beyond had eyed
it wistfully it was to be his part to
deny them their last little pretense to
respectability and leave them with their
addition unpaid

  the cheap american watch bought
to fill the place of those they had
thrown m the sea-was it m a lifetime
before-lay between them walters
feet found anitas under the table and
there interlocked he took the loaded
derringers from his inner pocket
when ghosts walked



cocked them under the cloth and laid
them sheltered from observing eyes
at his right hand

  it was on the stroke of midnight
the threshold of the new yean his
left hand sought hers and clasped
upon it the pressure being as convul-
sively returned curiously with a
minute between them and death with
all their souls crying out for a closer
embrace convention was too strong

  the changing current of the dyna-
mos dimmed the lights from white to
dimly glowing red and set the arm
lamps to sputtering they all winked
at once and went out

  now cried anita his right
hand the derringer in its grasp met
hers and as she bent forward she
guided it to the lovely space between
her closed eyes

  a tremendous report rang through
the hall followed almost instantly by
another even more rending the pistols
flashing through the momentary dark-
ness

  the lights came up

  horror of horrors

ii

  what are you doing to-night de-
mar 

  nothing in particular billy its
new years eve of course and i should
like to be somewhere where i can for-
get a years a long time in passing
but short to look back to

  of course old chap said billy van
slycke and i have just the thing
for you remember the hotel delapole
horror 

  certainly van it came too close
to the other for me to forget it i
reached london that very day

  i beg your pardon demar per-
haps id better say nothing more

  go on do what was your plan

  youre just back again so you dont
know what has been going on a

month ago madame scarlatti the clair-
voyant--you know-announced that we
were to have a repetition of that night
a year ago in the weather and that the
ghosts of these two headless people are
going to walk at the hotel delapole at
midnight to-night the newspapers
have taken it up to pass off a sort of
winter big gooseberry season and the
town is talking of nothing else its
a new thing a new kind of excitement
and every table is engaged i heard
about it as soon as i got here and en-
gaged a table for two harry leland
has been called home and i was afraid
i should have to go it alone until you
turned up come along thats a good
fellow

  the ghosts will walk will they
ive never seen a ghost billy van
though i have been feeling as if i had
it will be something to think about to
talk about what time

  if we get there at half after ten it
will be time enough to enjoy a leisurely
meal and be ready to have the spooks
served for dessert ill pick you up
here as i drive by eh 

  good old fellow ill be waiting
for you its going to be an awful night
out madame whats-her-name is a
good weather prophet

  isnt she though it gets worse
every minute so long and billy
van slycke went lightly out into the
gusty street waving a jovial hand to
his friend as he stepped into his cab

  george demar had been traveling
about europe for a year his physi-
cian had given him the excuse but his
object was in part forgetfulness in
part the attempt to solve a problem his
instinct rather than his reason had set
him his beautiful wife rejoicing in
her youth had bidden him good-by a
little more than a twelvemonth before
in their stately city house stipulating
that he must not follow her to the
steamer it was reasonable enough
for he both detested scenes and knew
when ghosts walked

the awkwardness of waiting until the
last minute for a farewell

  her going left him lonely at heartand
love and inclination were too strong
he did not leave for his office but
waited at home until he could count on
five minutes at the pier anita was
leaving him with his consent and ap-
proval of course yet greatly against
his concealed inclination he was a
man of the world and he believed that
a young wife is safest with an old hus-
band when he keeps her within call if
not within sight one last glimpse of
her he could get at least and he trusted
that the thought of his waving to her
as the great ship went out would per-
sist and form a tender and abiding
memory

  near the first gangway his eyes
steadily searching through the crowds
for anitas face lighted upon the figure
of her maid the instant minnie
caught his eye she ran doww to him

  oh mr demar my lady has not
come she cried

  nonsense minnie he replied
she left the house more than an hour
ago she was going to her friends
and then directly here

  yes mr demar but i have looked
all over the boat and i cant find a trace
of her none of the other ladies have
seen her either

  wheres mr scarsdale

  i dont know sir i havent seen
him i looked for him the first thing
when i couldnt find mrs demar
they have probably wandered down
to look at some of the machinery
minnie mr scarsdale is very fond
of engines and he would enjoy seeing
them start you look for them in the
engine room

  the girl did not move however until
the last warning was given when she
impulsively held out her hand t her
master before she reluctantly went
aboard he remained as reluctantly
ashore and he was always glad

afterward that he had taken minnies
hand it was well that the ending of
so much of his happy life should have
been marked by a token of interest and
affection however slight

  of course anita was on the ship his
reason told him lying down perhaps in
one of the several cabins secured for
her party if he had not already guessed
rightly in saying that she was in the
engine room with walter but he dis-
liked puzzles even when they were not
particularly intricate

  demar drove from the pier to his
office and there had he been a suspi-
cious man he would have found an-
other puzzle awaiting him the book-
keeper bade him good morning and
ventured the remark that he would be
lonely without mr scarsdale

  did you see him at the boat sir
he was in here about an hour ago

  what brought him back asked
demar quickly

  i dont know sir he went to the
vault a minute shook hands with me
and bolted out he had plenty of time
too

  demar went to the vault and found
the cash box stripped of its contents
oh he said to himself the silly boy
was afraid he hadnt money enough
he looked for some acknowledgment
of the amount and failing to find any
memorandum told the bookkeeper to
charge the cash then on hand to mr
scarsdales personal account there was
no puzzle about that surely walter
was very boyish about some things

  when an hour later the city thrilled
and shuddered at the calamity that be-
fell the graustark george demar in-
stinct again caught at the chance that
anita had missed the boat after all
he was only less shocked by the loss
of walter scarsdale for he loved the
boy like a son as he had loved his
father like a brother it was this sen-
timent in the back of his mind that
anita might have escaped that had sent
when ghosts walked

m

him to london to paris to vienna
and berlin traveling the year through
over europe in the hopeless and irra-
tional hope that she might some day
somewhere appear to him of the actu-
alities in the case he had no least sus-
picion was she not his wife was
not walter his son in everything but
blood  so passed the first weary
twelve months of his widowerhood
the rest of it stretching on to the end
was to be more weary more dismal
absolutely devoid of hope

  during his wanderings the thought
came to him too that his conscience
was not clear in the matter every day
he felt her taking-off to be a judgment
upon him for binding her in a loveless
marriage he knew-what man does
not-that he had not made her com-
pletely happy that he had not implanted
in her heart a tithe of the affection he
had so earnestly striven to sow there
toward the end-and it was poor con-
solation-she had seemed more buoyant
less given to the attacks of depression
that had kept her secluded in her room
from time to time could his very
love have driven her to the fatal ship
had she been glad to leave him these
unanswered queries gave added poign-
ancy to his grief

  all in good time though unusually
late for an engineer who was the soul
of punctuality billy van slycke came
bustling up from his cab the wind howl-
ing through the door as he entered
he stopped to rub his hands over the
bright fire on the hearth

  madame scarlatti is certainly a
wonder he exclaimed the evening
papers are full of it if she was right
about the weather the ghosts are surely
going to walk therell be a crowd at
the delapole

  the older man had himself carefully
wrapped against the inclement night
told his servant to wait up for him con-
gratulated billy on getting a coupe that
pretended to be heated and they soon

exchanged the worst weather of even
a london winter for the warmth and
hospitable brightness of the great din-
ing room of the hotel delapole they
made their way through a dissatisfied
throng of well-dressed men and women
and were only to gain progress by an-
swering the repeated question of the
attendants along the corridor with the
assurance that seats had been reserved
for them evidently the comments of
the press had overcome the difficulties
of the night

  the english always were a hardy
race was billys comment

  when they were safely seated at
last and had shivered away the last
chill of the storm without both of them
noted with amusement that the hardi-
ness of the english race did not extend
to ghosts in prospect as fully as to
weather in being there was an anx-
iety in the room and a glancing over
the shoulder as if something might
creep up behind in the occasional
lulls in the quiet conversation and the
business of the waiters the storm could
be heard bellowing overhead they
smiled at first themselves but were still
not entirely proof against the genera
feeling of apprehension in the room

  thats the table yonder said billy
indicating where walter scarsdale and
anita demar had seated themselves a
year before almost to a minute to-
night it was the only vacancy in the
room she was sitting bolt upright
what was left of her held in place by
their clenched hands he was down
on the table theyll be headless
ghosts demar

  dont billy demar shuddered
and there wasnt a clue

  not a thing not a recognizable
thing the coroners surgeon said that
both had dyed their hair and very
lately but he wouldnt venture to tell
what the original color had been ex-
cept that it was lighter

  fwhat color was it dyed


when ghosts walked

  great scott there was a bustle
throughout the room

  do you see those people there
theyre going to sit down at that table 

  a man and a woman were being es-
corted to the fatal spot and the room
grew deathly quiet every head turned
to watch

  of course i see them id be the
only one in the room that doesnt

  well they answer the printed de-
scription exactly hes tall smooth
shaven and with dark brown hair
shes plump and with red bronze hair
-thats just the picture of the mys-
terious couple in the papers to-night

  is it possible demars interest
like the others had a loathly fascina-
tion in it he went back to the con-
versation before the interruption
what was done with their clothing
with the pistols

  whose asked billy abstractedly
his eyes glued to the newly arrived
couple oh yes the police have
everything with photographs of the
bodies and a description of the little
moles and blemishes everybody has
somewhere but there was nothing and
nobody to tell who they were and why
they were in london the cabman
that drove them here picked them up
at kings cross-there all knowledge
of them ended its getting chilly in
here dont you think so billy shiv-
ered

  who has the hardihood to sit at
the very table where it happened
asked demar at once revolted and at-
tracted as he gazed at the newcomers

  billy called the head waiter as soon
as his attention could be diverted from
the queries being fired at him on every
side

  its sir john and lady memory
sir the functionary replied to a repe-
tition of the question hes a brave
man sir victoria cross sir and they
say he has a great wager laid on it

he went to convey his information to
the next table

  oh said the americans with in-
stant comprehension and fell to their
food though both felt their appetites
less keen than the dinner warranted

  as it came on toward midnight it
was increasingly evident that a sense of
the ghastliness of it all the unnerving
incongruity of outward gayety and
feasting as if to celebrate a deed that
had shocked civilization had worked
its way into the being of every guest at
the tables van sly eke and demar not
excepted

 the hotel management palpably
pleased that what had promised to be
avoidance of the place on such an an-
niversary had turned out the direct and
prosperous reverse was eagerly striv-
ing to do its best extra waiters hov-
ered about ready to be of service at
the slightest hint many of them were
busied with bottles of wine with de-
canters and siphons for there was an
abnormal amount of heavy drinking-
another sign of widespread apprehen-
sion from this the waiters themselves
suffered and many of them as the
evening drew toward its close exhibited
symptoms of drunkenness

  a little before twelve oclock one of
these befuddled attendants dropped an
armful of dishes in the upper end of
the hall the crash was followed by
screams from several of the women
and then by a depressing silence-mo-
mentary but none the less noticeable
it was broken by hysterical laughing
and crying that set every one on edge
and a charmingly dressed woman was
led from the room by her mortified es-
cort her feelings quite beyond her con-
trol

  now as the year was rushing on to
its doom there was a consultation of
timepieces on every hand and a reach-
ing nervously forward for glasses of
wine or whisky and water every mo-
ment the americans drank more
when ghosts walked

ms

than they had intended to and were

sitting taciturn and foreboding

  they never found the man who had
been waiting on them did they van
said demar to make himself talk

  no replied billy rousing himself
to the question with evident effort
he was last seen running through the
pantry he never came back

  and they left nothing to pay for
their supper

  not a sou markee said billy
there wasnt anything of value on
either of them not a coin or a scrap
of paper

  poor devils

  they fell silent again their gaze
restlessly straying about the room al-
ways returning to the table where sir
john and lady memory were sitting
as it came closer to twelve the whole
company hushed a woman flushed
with wine laughed aloud and was
frowned into immediate quietude from
every side the nerves of a roomful
were stretched almost to breaking
point

  the clock its laughing cupids still in
mockery about it came to midnight
nothing happened those who had
been holding their watches open in
their hands gave a sigh of relief as
they returned them to their pockets
the new year temporarily forgotten
would have been toasted in another
minute a few had already taken their
glasses in their hands the storm
could be heard howling overhead

  then the lights responsive to the
changing dynamos at that hour began
to go down down until they showed
again a dim and ominous red and the
sharp crackling of the arc lights sent
a shiver through the room the shriek-
ing wind was all that could be heard
the waiters as they bent forward to
their tasks stiffening as they stooped
every eye sought the fatal table
through the gathering dusk where sir
ioatb

john smiling now sat fingering a visit-
ing card

  without further warning the lights
flashed into undue and blinding bril-
liancy and as suddenly expired the
wind rose to a howl and a cold blast
swept though the half light at that
instant there were two sharp reports
in succession ringing through the hall
scream upon scream arose from the
women those horrifying shrilling
screams that bespeak mortal agony
the deep groan of a mans voice could
be heard the room was still lighted
by the candelabra on each table and it
could be seen that all about the hall men
were trying to soothe their frightened
companions

  some one is hurt exclaimed van
slycke see right back of you there
a man is covered with blood

  as demar turned his veins running
cold there was a crash and roar over-
head and a gust of freshing air swept
down upon the tables extinguishing the
last glimmer of light a patter of fly-
ing feet was heard and instant panic
would have piled up the roomful of
people at the doorway had not van
slycke his engineering experience giv-
ing him presence of mind put his
hands to his mouth and let out a sten-
torian shout that demanded attention

  sit down you damned fools he
yelled are englishmen afraid of
spooks sit down i say youll kill
your women

  from the front of the hotel from
the pantry came men with white faces
running with lights they were hardly
needed for the electric lights returned
to duty and the room grew red and
then brilliantly white once more

  the company was on its feet every
head turned and neck craned to see
the fatal table it was vacant with
a cry a woman fainted-one of sir
johns many friends in the place no
one could have seated himself again
tremblingly they filed through the cor-


when ghosts walked

ridor a silent sober and frightened
crowd for once the hotel delapole
had seen the pretended human anxiety
to see ghosts walk fully appeased

  the next morning billy van slycke
rushed in upon george demar early
as it was and after such a night he was
up and dressed

  happy new year to you said the
irrepressible engineer have you seen
the papers 

  no said the older man happy
new year is there anything new
theyre poking a good deal of fun
at us billy replied of course the
tricks the lights played on us were due
to the storm hitting the wires some-
where and the two reports were from
the arc globes cracked by the cold wind
one or two were cut a little by the fall-
ing pieces the cold blast was from a
skylight that blew out thats all
simple enough and sir john apolo-
gizes through the newspapers for his
abrupt retirement but his lady fainted
and he felt he had to carry her out at
once he has paid for it of course-
loses his wager-it was for a thousand
pounds but that isnt all

  it rather spoils the ghost story
though doesnt it suggested demar

  no it doesnt contradicted van
slycke abruptly it doesnt sir
john inadvertently left a card on the
table and it was walter scarsdales
walter scarsdales why you
know he went down on the graustark
a year ago said demar incredulous
and amazed

  thats just it lets go and see
him about it hell be home on new
years day

  the two men took billys cab for
sir johns town house the paper giv-
ing them the address they were
shown into his study by the footman
and sir john dignified but with an
eager interrogatory in his manner came
in immediately

  the two visitors introduced them-

selves apologized and stated their er-
rand

  i expected you said the baronet in
reply madame scarlatti told me two
americans would call to-day

  somewhat dismayed but impelled by
his natural energy to act as spokesman
billy went on

  we were warm friends of scars-
dales he explained i was his chum
in college and mr demar here was a
friend of his fathers as well you
know he went down on the graustark
a little more than a year ago

  then it was not he who gave me
that card replied sir john for it
was handed me in london a year ago
yesterday morning by a man about my
height with a sandy beard and slightly
darker hair

  thats the man said van slycke
demars face was gray then he
did not go down on the graustark
van he said

  most surprising gentlemen com-
mented sir john we seem to be be-
ginning another mystery do we not
but the americans were too full of
their own thoughts they thanked sir
john declined the proffered refresh-
ments and went out into the street

  demar i thftik i ought to tell you
now that leland told me fanny saw
anitas ghost the same morning that
sir john met scarsdales

  billy said george demar i feel
completely done up

  all right old chap responded van
sympathetically but im going to
have a look at the photographs of those
bodies

  demars eyes caught and held his
countrymans dont go billy dont
go i thought of it but im not going
there was a flash of comprehension
and the younger mans hand went out
i wont he said if you wont de-
mar i loved walter

  i wont billy george demar said
with a sigh i loved-his father
soldiers and

what we think

a high official recently delivered
a speech at the forum luncheon
of the brooklyn chamber of
commerce he said in part that the
soldiers to-day are not staying unem-
ployed as a body figures are hard
to get but i am convinced that the
large majority of the soldiers who are
discharged find jobs quickly and go to
them promptly it is a minority of the
men who dont seem to be able to place
themselves

  we disagree with this official for it
is our experience through intimate con-
tact with returning soldiers and sailors
that the average man finds it hard to
get a job and it is the exceptional man
who secures a position the opinion
of the country seems to concur with
the gentleman above and we are gran-
diosely patting ourselves on the back
meeting our soldiers with bands and
speeches and parades and sandwiches
and smiles but in the meanwhile our
heroes who went across the water re-
turn and literally walk the streets en-
deavoring to find honest work it is
a condition that may lead to serious
labor troubles in the united states
the regrettable part of it is that such
a state of affairs is absolutely unnec-
essary if it had not been for a few
of the very wealthy people in the coun-

try even the department devoted to
employment under the government
would have had to close congress ad-
journed and took no steps to pay its
just debts to the soldiers- beyond a pal-
try sixty dollars allotted to each man
discharged-not enough money to get
a complete outfit of clothes how can
we expect a man who has given up
everything that he had in order to go
over there to look with an optimistic
eye on such a condition his state of
mind and body is something that de-
serves the instant and intimate atten-
tion of every patriotic citizen we re-
ceive letters from all over the country
wherein this is shown almost without
exception men are stranded their
families and friends are forced to sup-
port them during the emergency they
cannot purchase new clothes it is not
dignified after a time to take a position
in some very small capacity in the uni-
form of our country it is not pleasant
to have to go from office to office fac-
tory to factory et cetera always meet-
ing the same answer leave your
name and address and we will give you
something if it turns up

  we feel that the gentleman who goes
to meet our returning soldiers is worthy
of commendation he is a charming
individual he extends the glad hand
waves a banner and cheers lustily but
does this affable gentleman do anything
 soldiers and sailors personal relief section

else does he go out and get these
men positions does he keep them
from having to worry as to what they
are going to do when they return to
civilian life in other words does he
do anything practical does he come
home with the bacon  that is the
question we ask him

  we do not wish to seem pessimistic
it is not our nature we are always
inclined to find a smile where a frown
ought to be but we dont believe in
shutting our eyes to the plain truth
soldiers are people not uniforms
they like cheers and handshaking but
what they like best is work where they
can be assured of a fairly decent living
and to be able to hold their heads up
among their fellows

  in this connection we would like to
call our readers attention to the fol-
lowing editorial that appeared in one
of the new york papers recently

protecting the soldier

  we dont enjoy taking advice lots
of us dont and to be pointed to an
example we might follow but wont is
even more annoying australia has just
done something that will appeal learn
from melbourne that minister of de-
fence wise announces that under the
defense act employers refusing to re-
instate returned soldiers are liable to
a fine of twenty-five hundred dollars
the minister added that the court
could order the fine paid to an employee
not reinstated only thing we can crit-
icize about this is that it doesnt appear
to be mandatory when soldiers are
needed to march away to war they are
promised everything imaginable but
when danger is supposed to be past and
the boys come home its a different
story

an interesting matter

  when you find what your ideas are
go to them and do your best to obtain
them this was the message deliv-

ered by lieutenant colonel theodore
roosevelt junior recently to the sev-
eral thousand soldiers sailors and ma-
rines at the regular sunday afternoon
entertainment for men in service at the
manhattan opera house

  the war is over he said and let
me advise every one of you men not to
let the hero business get stale and
threadbare before you get something to
do i saw a motto the other day on
a fifth avenue sign that they shall
not have died in vain which i think
should be taken to heart by all men who
have been in the service and by their
friends and relatives and the friends
and relatives of those who suffered on
the battlefields over there to make the
world better

  i feel sure that you men want to
put manliness and honor into the world
instead of saeing what you can get out
of it without any effort on your part

  the armies are being disbanded and
it is up to the real american to get into
the game and take an active part in
the affairs of everyday life let the
democrats take an active interest in
democratic ideals and politics and let
the republicans take an interest in their
ideals and politics

  lieutenant colonel roosevelt has
also announced plans for an association
of officers and enlisted men who served
in the war the purpose of such an
association will be to keep alive the
spirit of the american soldiers and
every man who served during the war
will be taken into partnership the ed-
itor would like to hear from the readers
of the thrill book concerning such
an association brief letters will be
printed

the case of hickey

  on november   james hickey
twenty years old a waif knowing
neither father nor mother nor birth-
place but being a citizen of the united
states entered the united states army
soldiers and sailors personal relief section 

if the world owed this pathetic figure
any kindness friendship or sympathy
that debt has never been recognized
he got more than his share of the kicks
and cuffs that frequently come to the
homeless orphan from every side and
in this case the worst of it seems to
have come from the officers of the
army which he joined his military
record is evidence of his hopeless lot
no part of which was worse than that
spent in the so-called military service
of his country his military history
begins with his blank allotment card
stating that he had no kith or kindred
it ends with the record of his trial by
court-martial this record reveals the
tragedy of the existence of this human
waif and induces one to wonder why
life ever should have been given to a
human soul only to be left undeveloped
bruised and starved the story is told
in general court-martial record no
 and runs like this

  james hickey drafted november 
 had been but a few weeks in the
service when he committed the unpar-
donable military crime of absence with-
out leave for two hours at fort omaha
nebraska- as a result of that initial
offense he was imprisoned in the guard-
house where he remained for thirteen
months knowing nothing of the
length of his sentence or the cause for
it having been told by an officer in
authority that he would probably re-
main imprisoned for ten years more
and having been advised by another
officer that he had better get out the
first opportunity he broke out of prison
and got away on last christmas night

  apprehended on january th this
twenty-year-old boy with the mind of
a child was then promptly tried for
desertion to which he pleaded guilty
the prosecution called two witnesses
to prove the case and these in essential
details corroborated the story the ac-
cused soldier told on oath the seven-
page loosely written record of the trial

of this boy defended by a frightened
chaplain concludes with the testimony
of the boy himself which reveals a fig-
ure so pathetic and sad as to cause the
soul of men excepting military men
to cry out in anguish for him who from
his birth had had no chance in life
had never known an act of kindness
or heard a word of sympathy and who
had never known the protection of a
father or the loving care of a mother
who indeed had never known his par-
ents names

  thereupon the court went into secret
session and sentenced this boy who
had had no chance whatever in life
either in or out of the army to be dis-
honorably discharged from the service
to forfeit all pay and allowances due
or to become due and to be confined
at hard labor at such place as the re-
viewing authority may direct for eight-
een months the sentence was ap-
proved and was doubtless regarded in
military circles as very lenient the
trial consumed forty minutes the find-
ing vindicated the law and established
discipline in the army

  and this trial took place and the boy
was convicted notwithstanding the fact
that a board of medical officers four
months before had pronouncelthat tins
boy had only the mind of a child of
seven years rather than that of a man
responsible for his misconduct

to the editor or business manager

  the great difficulty encountered by
the government in reeducating disabled
soldiers and sailors is to get informa-
tion of the opportunity to them there
is an astonishing number of these men
out in civil life badly handicapped by
their injuries but endeavoring never-
theless to work it is most amazing
the ignorance of the average man and
woman about what the government
stands ready to do and is doing for
these men

  this board is endeavoring to spread
this information as widely as possible
in the hope of alleviating the miserable
condition of some of these disabled sol-
diers and i am asking you if you will
not print the inclosed or as much as
you can find space for in any way
which seems to you likely to attract
attention it is a little piece of patri-
otic service whose object is most laud-
able

  i know that you have been deluged
with a great deal of propaganda matter
from washington but happily to this
charge we can plead not guilty as
this is the first request we have made
of you and we do it not on behalf of
ourselves but of these disabled soldiers
who have reached their present desper-
ate condition defending you and your
business i greatly hope that you will
assist us to the extent of helping give
circulation to this information

very sincerely yours

charles h winslow
chief division of research

every disabled soldier and
sailor should know

  that the government is resolved to
do its best to restore him to health
strength and self-supporting activity

  that until his discharge from hos-
pital care the medical and surgical
treatment necessary to restore him to
health and strength is under the juris-
diction of the military or naval
authorities

  that the vocational training which
may be afterwards necessary to restore
his self-supporting activity is under the
jurisdiction of the federal board for
vocational education

  that if he needs an artificial limb
or other orthopedic or mechanical ap-
pliance the bureau of war risk insur-
ance supplies it free upon his discharge
and renews it when considered neces-
sary

  that if after his discharge he again
needs medical treatment on account of
his disability the bureau of war risk
insurance supplies it free

  that any man whose disability en-
titles him to compensation under the
war risk insurance act may be pro-
vided by the federal board with a
course of vocational training for a new
occupation

  that the government strongly rec-
ommends each man who needs it to
undertake vocational training and put
himself under the care of the federal
board but the decision to do so is
optional with each man

  that if his disability does prevent
him from returning to employment
without training and he elects to follow
a course of vocational training provided
by the federal board the course will
be furnished free of cost and he will
also be paid as long as the training lasts
a monthly compensation equal to the
sum to which he is entitled under the
war risk insurance act or a sum
equal to the pay of his last month of
soldiers and sailors personal relief section 

active service whichever is the greater
but in no case will a single man or a
man required by his course of instruc-
tion to live apart from his dependents
receive less than sfxty-five dollars per
month exclusive of the sum paid de-
pendents  nor will a man living with his
dependents receive less than seventy-
five dollars per month inclusive of sum
paid to dependents

  that if his disability does not prevent
him from returning to employment
without training and he elects to follow
a course of vocational training pro-
vided by the federal board the course
will be furnished free of cost to him
and the compensation provided by the
war risk insurance act will be paid
to him but no allowance will be paid
to his family

  that in addition to the above the
family or dependents of each disabled
man will receive from the government
during his period of training the same
monthly allotment and allowance as
that paid prior to his discharge from
the army or the navy

  that upon completion of his course
of training he will continue to receive
the compensation prescribed by the
war risk insurance act so long as his
disability continues

  that in nearly every case by fol-
lowing the advice and suggestions of
the federal board he can either get
rid of the handicap caused by his dis-
ability or acquire new powers to re-
place any that may have been lost

  that if he is willing to learn and
to take advantage of the opportunities
to increase his skill offered him by the
federal board he can usually get a bet-
ter position than he had before entering
the service

  that if he fails to take advantage
of these opportunities he will find him-
self badly handicapped when he is
obliged to compete with the able-bodied
men who come back to work after the
wan

  that the federal board through its
vocational experts will study his par-
ticular disability and advise him as to
the proper course to pursue and give
him free-training for the occupation
best suited to him

  that on the satisfactory completion
of his training the federal board
through its employment service will
assist him to secure a position

  that public authorities and other
large employers will in many cases at
least give the disabled soldiers and
sailors preference when filling vacant
positions provided they possess the
training necessary to fill them

  all disabled soldiers whether in or
out of the hospital should address their
communications either to the federal
board for vocational education wash-
ington d c or to the district office

questions and answers

  question-information on the fol-
lowing subject would be appreciated
how is present government insurance
transferred to old-line insurance how
much of the time the insurance is car-
ried at present rates will apply on an
endowment policy any information
as to where one can get dope on this
subject will be appreciated like your
book but hope you get some real thrill
stories like wolf of the steppes-
b d b

  answer-your best policy is to write
directly to the bureau of war risk
insurance information section
washington d c for complete in-
formation as your question covers a
fairly broad field we are glad that
you like the thrill book and hope
that you will become a regular reader

  question-saw your first book
through a friend of mine and am ask-
ing for some advice i was discharged

about a month ago after returning from
a years service overseas my old posi-
tion in new york was filled so it was
me for a new job i finally landed one
down here at my trade-a machinist
now my wife says she wont come
down to a hick village like this to
live and if i dont get a job in or near
new york shes through with me i
know this isnt exactly in your line but
sometimes it helps to get another per-
sons view what i want to do is to
get a job up north but if i cant how
can i get my wife to look at it the right
way i spent most of my time on the
other side looking forward to getting
back to home and my wife im rather
up a tree and would appreciate any ad-
vice you could give me will watch
your magazine for an answer-j b
h ex-sergeant of infantry

  answer-there is only one answer
if your wife is not willing to stand
by you when you need her help this
is a sure sign that she cares very little
for you my advice is to stick to your
position make good and if by that time
she still remains away you can be con-
fident that she does not want to do
her part i would suggest in the mean-
while that you write her at length and
lay the case before her fairly and
squarely give her a chance often
these things are straightened out ami-
cably for both sides by a little intelli-
gent consideration

a

many questions are asked about
wound stripes here are some
leading ones

  if a man is wounded twice by sep-
arate bullets at the same time does he
get one stripe or two

  what about the man hit in many
places by fragments of the same shell

  if he is hit once then starts back
and is hit again is it one wound or
two

  if a leg and arm are shot off simul-
taneously what about it
soldiers and sailors personal relief section 

  these questions were taken to the
war department at washington to a
clerk there who specializes in wound
stripes

  the clerk looked over the list that
is all covered he said in general or-
der  and pointed to the following

  a gold chevron of pattern identical
with that of the war-service chevron
to be worn on the lower half of the
right sleeve of all uniform coats ex-
cept fatigue coats by each officer field
clerk and enlisted man who has re-
ceived or who may hereafter receive
a wound in action with the enemy or
as the result of an act of the enemy
which necessitates treatment by a med-
ical officer and an additional chevron
for each additional wound but not
more than one chevron will be worn
for two or more wounds received at
the same time disablement by gas
necessitating treatment by a medical
officer shall be considered to be a
wound within the meaning of this or-
der

  all those questions have come up
said the clerk and the answer is as
the order shows that no matter how
many wounds are received at the same
time the man gets only one chevron
if a soldier were wounded and started
back and was wounded later he would
be entitled to two wound chevrons the
many questions that have arisen have
required official interpretation of other
parts of the order for example the
medical officer must be an officer of
the army-to keep the records clear-
and this issue was settled by the claims
of soldiers of a merchant ship that
they were wounded in a submarine at-
tack there was no army medical offi-
cer on board their wounds were not
serious enough to require attention
after the ship reached port so that
no connection was established with the
medical department of the army
their claims had to be denied

  the wound chevron is naturally the

most prized in the army there are
soldiers in the united states army who
were wounded during the spanish-
american war they began to put in
applications soon after the order was
issued on the ground of a wound re-
ceived more than twenty years ago it
was ruled that the order was retroactive
and the veterans of the spanish-amer-
ican war received the coveted chevrons
then the question came up as to the
civil war and this of course was
decided affirmatively by the ruling on
the later war those affected are re-
tired army officers they may wear
wound chevrons for the civil war
wounds on some occasions limited in
number

  some are seen on the streets now
with wound chevrons and other chev-
rons sewed on civilian clothing this
is against the regulations and is cov-
ered in the following memorandum
from the adjutant general p c har-
ris 

  these chevrons-meaning all-are
for wear on the army uniform only
and should not be worn on civilian
clothing neither gold blue nor silver
chevrons will be issued to men after
their discharge from the army but the
war department has no objection to
honorably discharged officers or en-
listed men who rendered the necessary
service purchasing service chevrons
from private firms provided they wear
them only on their uniform when that
uniform may be worn and provided
also that they make application to the
adjutant general of the army stating
service rendered so that the same may
be verified and the right of the appli-
cant to wear the chevrons verified

  no steps have been taken against
those who have chevrons on civilian
clothes the practice thus far simply be-
ing discouraged but there is authority
and if the custom spreads this authority
may be invoked

the enlarging of the thwll
book comes on the date that
opens a new era in the united
states we might call the next period
the sahara period and if ever peo-
ple needed thrills they will need them
now the thrill book will have to
take the place of the mythical cocktail
and the forgotten glass of foaming
beer it comes to you with the inaugu-
ration of an experiment in america
which all of us will watch with ex-
treme interest the subject of prohi-
bition has long been discussed now it
is upon us with full force whether
it will prove a success or a failure re-
mains to be seen human nature is
naturally optimistic we think and it
reacts swiftly to the many influences
with which it comes in contact the
american spirit is fine even awe-inspir-
ing equal to any emergency it has
consented to this in its open-hearted
way let us hope that the latest change
in the constitution is one that will be

of value at any rate we have the
sly feeling that the thwll book will
become more necessary than ever we
have been told that it was a kind of
oasis in the desert of modern maga-
zines now is its chance atta boy

  among those present as they say
in the paper in this issue is tod rob-
bins a writer who possesses the rare
faculty of making fantasy and imagi-
nation real and vital oscar wilde re-
marked in one of his inimitable essays
that art itself is really a form of ex-
aggeration  and selection which is the
very spirit of art is nothing more than
an intensified mode of overemphasis
we agree with this and we think that
as an artist of prose tod robbins is
without an equal among the younger
school of writers read the bibulous
baby and if you dont think that it
is the most astounding and clever bit
of fiction that you have ever run across
we lose our one best bet so far we
cross-trails



are frank enough to admit that the
bizarre the fantastic the unusual the
adventurous appeal to us strongly it
was this that caused us to open fire
with the thrill book carrying the
thought a bit further we might add
that such stories as the bibulous
baby are hard to find even for a
magazine that has already published
extraordinary and out-of-the-rut fiction
this little tale stands out sharply it is
a gem of its kind it contains that
ironic humor that has made h c bun-
ner dear to all our hearts that flavor
that runs through eugene field mark
twain and the best of o henry in
this connection we confess that we con-
sider the above-named writers purely
american in their refreshing geniality
and lack of imitation what cheers
us considerably is the fact that tod
robbins is a hard worker he takes
his pen seriously he doesnt waste
his time doing space fillers or fol-
lowing the trend of many fictioneers
who have made the thrill book pop-
ular by its very contrast to their hum-
drum material we are lucky enough
to have a few more of these short bits
by robbins and also a few months
hence we will start a serial by him that
certainly has no parallel to-day

  with this issue of the thrill
book we lay before you the work of
some of the best writers of fiction the
name of h bed ford-jones carries with
it a large following of devoted readers
and it makes us feel especially happy
to announce the fact that we have
secured what is without doubt the best
serial he has ever written-the opium
ship-beginning in this number one
becomes breathless following the ad-
ventures of sir gerald desmond gen-
tleman and soldier of fortune it isnt
so much that he is continually running
into danger but what holds us is the
way he gets out of it we can recom-
mend the coming installments to you

with a safe conscience during the en-
tire history of the thrill book we
do not recall ever having run across
a cleaner more straightforward and
adventurous tale than this it comes
right up to the standard which we in-
tend to follow now and always

  we can promise you more stories
by h bedford-jones write to us and
tell us what you think of this serial

  among our discoveries in fiction we
rate clarence l andrews very highly
his first story came to us january th
and we made him an offer almost at
once it was called profit by loss
and appeared in our april th issue
our readers have written to us telling
us how much they like it to them the
novelette vanishing gold in this
number will come as a welcome sur-
prise here is a writer with a golden
future he knows how to tell a story
and he has the patience of a genius
ail the work that comes from his pen
is of the highest craftsmanship pos-
sessing human interest and always one
finds a corking plot that holds one fas-
cinated from the first line to the last
the success of an author like andrews
is one of the pleasures that come to
an editor after he has tackled huge
piles of ominous-looking manuscripts
without losing hope that among them
somewhere is the kind of material he
knows will win favor we have other
stories by andrews and we warn you
that if you miss any of them you will
regret it

  among the stories in this issue that
have appealed to us strongly we men-
tion the conqueror by robert w

writer the tenth crisis by l j

knowledge of the short story is only
exceeded by his understanding of hu-

that contains a very unique situation
and a whirlwind surprise at the end

from our readers

  here is a letter that conveys sincerity
in every line

  dear editor-have just finished
reading your thrill book of this date
and to express my honest opinion of it
i would say it is great i like the
stories the jeweled ibis and the
shadows of race and would like to
see more like them they were simply
wonderful

  i also liked a hooting tooting
son-of-a-gun i am from the west
and like to read western stories

  wishing you good luck and waiting
anxiously for the next thrill book
i am yours very truly

ccwade

  we are always glad to hear from
men in the service or out of it here
is a real letter

  dear sir congrats youve cer-
tainly filled a long-felt want when you
brought the thrill book before the
public i found the first two numbers
on a stand here in camp taylor this
morning and instinctively scenting
something novel i purchased them
besides being curious as to their con-
tents i had noted the street  smith
imprint and that was sufficient guar-
antee that this new magazine was up
to the mark

  carefully i perused the editorials on
the back covers then on getting to
barracks i went at the stories them-
selves to see if they were wjiat the
editor claimed them well not only
did they justify all his claims they sur-
prised me as well for they turned out
to be even better than id expected
for unusual stories theyve pretty
nearly everything beat and having read
magazines for many years i stand in
a position to know

  the first i tackled was wolf of the
steppes it looked odd but the first
paragraphs caught my interest and the
subsequent events described held me
until the last line its as weird as any
ive read so far

  ivory hunters is unusual but up
to careys standard i know that
authors work in this latest he nearly
outdid himself

  j c kofoed handled splendidly his
characters in the jeweled ibis here
weve a tale of unsurpassed mystery
as well as adventure give your read-
ers more of this type youll find they
enjoy them immensely in the shad-
ows of race by j h bishop youve
given another highly entertaining yam
so far ive read both parts and have
had my appetite whetted for the rest
of it i suppose it will run to four
or five parts a hooting tooting
son-of-a-gun is good put across
more of smileys stuff this story is
a hummer the web of death and
the man who met himself are both
fine and so there you have a brief
review of about all of them and can
see that theyve pleased me

  as soon as im discharged which i
expect will be within a week from to-
day ill show the first two numbers to
my friends and relatives and i know
of at least a dozen subscriptions you
will receive as a result

  i am inclosing the addresses of sev-
eral of ray comrades who were at my
side at the front in france id sug-
gest your sending them each a sample
copy of the thrill book

  im a willing and ready-to-help

  yanks return is like enoch ardens

  wearing two gold service stripes on his
uniform a large middle-aged man walked
into the san angelo texas post office a
short time ago and point-blank asked the
janitor if williamson was his name

 it is replied john m williamson
fifty-three years old and stooped with the
cares of a large family whats yours

  dooley is my name was the quiet re-
ply

 thus met two men who the returned
soldier charges are married to the same
woman williamson says his wife was
deserted at cleburne more than ten years
ago and had a divorce she was wash-
ing clothes to support herself and three
small children when he became the head
of the family in 

  dooley tells a thrilling tale he and
his wife who had been married once be-
fore and had a son and their three chil-
dren lived in cleburne in  hoping
to obtain work in the railroad shops at
temple dooley went there he says he
met a stranger who told of riches that
awaited in mexico and agreed to accom-
pany his new-found friend the farewell
note he wrote to his wife was the last
mrs dooley ever heard from her husband
until he appeared here recently

  hardly had he left the rio grande be-
hind when he was arrested for what
dooley says he does not know his cap-
tors were mexicans a band of rough men
he was confined in an underground
dungeon and there for seven years his
life wasted away he was given whole-
some food three times a day but the only
light of ray that he knew filtered through
bars that were far beyond his reach and
dooley obtained his only exercise by
tramping his cen his beard grew down
to his waist and his clothes rotted in the
foul atmosphere and fell from his body

 freedom finally came by means of a
dumb-waiter on which food each day was
lowered to the prisoner one day meals

were not forthcoming and dooley jerked
down the rickety platform and pulled
himself to the top the entrance to what
then appeared to be an old mine was un-
guarded and dooley started on foot
across the barren country he was picked
up by federal cavalrymen who escorted
him to the border having no passport
dooley swam the river and reached el
paso search for his wife proved un-
availing and the blacksmith then forty-
two years of age joined the army

  he went to france fought gallantly in
many battles and returned to the states
in january the following month he was
discharged at san antonio through an
uncle in oklahoma he learned that a step-
son was at lampasas the young man
directed him to san angelo telling doo-
ley that his mother had married a man
named williamson it was in this way
that dooley located his family

  ima his oldest girl was only five years
old when her father left she greeted
him a young woman of fifteen maggie
who had been only seven months old ap-
peared a girl of eleven ura the middle
sister is thirteen

  but dooley found his wife hardened
against him on account of what she be-
lieves was desertion on his part then
too he beheld two children-woodrow
may a girl named for president wilson
and john j pershing williamson a baby
boy aged three months who were born
after mrs dooleys marriage to the post-
office janitor and dooley gave up all
hopes of ever being reunited with the
woman

  but the man who for years was a pris-
oner of mexican bandits and who later
strafed the huns in france wants his
three children whom he intends to edu-
cate he has obtained these while mrs
williamson has gone to belton to live
with a sister she took with her wood-
row may and johnny pershing but wil-
liamson went after them wiiat the so-

  toss of coin settles fate of vessel

  toss of a coin settled the fate of the
old three-masted steamer areata which
for years has laid on the mud flats of
alameda cal dave crowley is the new
owner of the areata and as two at-
tempts to make her seaworthy have
failed he will tear her to pieces and salv-
age the machinery winches redder and
other parts which are in good condition
crowley expects to realize four thousand
dollars on the old hulk

 how crowley acquired the areata is
the subject of much gossip on the floor
of the marine department of the chamber
of commerce it appears that during a
discussion with james smith the ar-
catas former owner as to what he in-
tended to do with the ancient vessel
crowley offered to tos a coin for the
ship

  all right said smith ill toss with
you to see whether you give me fifteen
hundred dollars or i give you the ar-
eata 

 done promptly answered crowley
tom crowley his brother flipped a coin
and smith shouted heads as it came
down it was found that tails won
smith grinned and shook hands with
crowley and the bargain was sealed

  the old areata figured in the shipping
of the pacific coast for many years in
the old days

dog saves master fron bull

 joe orberg of manor texas night
watchman and official dog catcher had a
narrow escape from losing his life a short
time ago after roping a big bull as first
proceeding to landing the vicious animal
in the towns cattle pound orberg who
weighs two hundred and fifty pounds had
started leading the bull toward the pen
when the beast suddenly gave a loud
snort accompanied by a wild leap that
sent the marshal sprawling upon the
ground luckily orberg had his dog
brownie with him and the dog saved his
life

 when the bull observed the marshal

lying on the ground which it did before
orberg could regain his feet it imme-
diately charged and was about to ore
the fallen man with its horns when the
dog made a long leap and caught the bull
by the nose and with a quick side move-
ment threw the animal upon its side
getting a good hold on the bulls throat
the dog would have killed it had not or-
berg interfered and wrenched brownie
away from the bellowing beast

  after this the bull was very docile and
kept its eyes constantly upon the dog
as it was led to the pound orberg is now
prouder than ever crf brownie and says
he wouldnt take a thousand dollars for
him

 baby eats four pounds of buckshot

  mrs bertha noting of ennis texas is
no physician or surgeon in fact she is
so tender-hearted that she could not at-
tend the bedside of any person who might
have been operated on she hasnt the
slightest knowledge of surgery even in
the most elementary stage but this week
she performed an operation-a major
operation-which caused the leading
surgeons of the city to stt up and listen

 more than that she performed the
operation on her two-year-old daughter
martha marie it was a matter of life
or death with martha marie and mrs
noting could not secure the services of
a surgeon promptly hence she took the
matter in hand herself

 while mrs noting was attending to
the household duties little martha marie
got possession of a four-pound sack of
buckshot bullets about the size of a candy
lemon drop she liked the looks of the
blue candy and began swallowing them
right off before mrs noting knew what
had happened little martha marie had
devoured the four pounds of shot

  she did not appear troubled but when
mrs noting picked her up to rock her to
sleep she noticed the childs weight had
increased perceptibly pretty soon mar-
tha marie had a pain-several of them-
in her tummy she began to cry and
then told her mother about swallowing
all the blue candy in the bag she showed
her mother the mpty bag and rubbed
her stomach
around the world



  right then mrs noting decided some-
thing must be done and done at once
she phoned several physicians but they
were busy with flu patients and couldnt
come mrs noting then hit upon a plan
she would operate on the little girl her-
self and she did

  did mrs noting slice her little daugh-
ter open with a cruel knife and take the
bullets out oh no i

  she just took little martha marie by
the heels and gave her a few shakes-
good hard shakes-and the buckshot came
rolling out on the floor she repeated
the operation and finally shook all the
shot out of the baby

  physicians declare they had never
thought of performing such an operation
but that it was simple and effective
enough-incidentally it saved the mother
a fee of fifty bones

  martha marie went right on and took
her nap she never felt the slightest ef-
fects of the operation

build public works-

  public works of all kinds that will give
employment to men demobilized from the
army and from the war industries should
be put under way at once as a reconstruc-
tion measure according to secretary of
labor wilham b wilson who in a state-
ment outlining his views on this subject
points out that not only will the transi-
tion from war-time conditions to a peace

basis be facilitated thereby but that a
work of great permanent value to the
nation will be accomplished

  states cities towns in fact all govern-
mental divisions ought now he believes
to make up for the reduced construction
due to the war the governments obliga-
tion to provide employment for the re-
turning soldiers and the necessity for
many forms of improvement in municipal
and state equipment render such a pro-
gram essential at this time he holds

  the secretarys statement follows

  i am of the opinion that from the
time we restore ourselves to our normal
postwar activities the demand for peace-
time production will be so great that
there will not be the remotest possibility
of securing any reduction in the wage
rates from their present basis i feel
further that the manufacturer who fails
to take into consideration the prospects
of the future and who in a hope of secur-
ing a cheaper labor or cheaper raw ma-
terial does not build up his organization
and maintain it during the possibly brief
period of readjustment will be handi-
capped in securing his share of the busi-
ness afterward because he will be handi-
capped through lack of working forces
in his factory

  iit therefore seems to me that the situ-
ation resolves itself into taking care of
the possible problem in the interim be-
tween our ceasing war activities and the
time when we have assumed our natural
postwar activities

he got babys picture

  although he had never seen his baby
born after his departure for france
lieutenant ralph s bush of junction
city kan received a picture of the little
one just before he was killed in action
according to a letter to mrs bush from
a brother officer lieutenant james c
bodin

  ralph had just received the photos of
the baby and he showed them to all of
us writes lieutenant bodin at noon
on august th on a long march toward
fismes we received orders to move over
across the railroad and river and attack
the woods that run parallel with another

  tfce great possibilities in tongsten

 australia is second in importance
among british territories producing
tungsten ores in queensland many of
the principal mines have quite recently
been acquired by one of the largest of
the concerns which have established
tungsten reduction plants in great brit-
ain since the war and the event appears
to promise a new era of progress for this
branch of mining in queensland wolf-
ram is mined m new south wales and
victoria while important quantities of
scheelite another ore of tungsten are
obtained in new zealand and in tas-
mania

 wolfram is also obtained as a by-
product of the cornish tin industry and
has received special attention during the
last four years canada has become a
producer chiefly of sheelite mined in
halifax county nova scotia and deposits
are also known in rhodesia

  it is difficult to foresee the future of
tungsten but it is worth while to ex-
amine the considerations which would
lead one to form an opinion it would
be optimistic to expect a continuance of
the eager demand and handsome prices
realized at times during the last four
years if a general commercial depres-
sion and a fall in the worlds demand for
steel were to take place tungsten would
suffer as would many other commodities
oil the other hand activity in the worlds
steel trade should support the position of
tungsten its popularity among steel
makers as a steel hardener would seem to
be established for the present the pos-
sibility may also be borne in mind that
the results of scientific research which
has been continuously conducted during
the war may lead to new uses for the
metal tungsten proved to be a dominat-
ing factor in military power as soon as

it was recognized that modern war must
be waged with shells by the million and
with guns by thousands its individual
power in times of peace may prove
equally great

war machine-making tools for educa-
tion

  machines that until a few months ao
were busily engaged in grinding out
weapons of destruction soon are to be
used to foster the genius of potential
young american inventors practically
all of the governments war machine-
making tools nearly one hundred miuion
dollars worth of which now are in storage
at washington will be turned over to
the nations vocational training schools
if congress acts favorably on a bill now
pending before it

  under the provisions of this measure
which was introduced into the lower
house of congress by representative
caldwell of new york it is proposed to
permit universities colleges and other
institutions now using antiquated or
worn-out equipment to select the new-
est machines from the stocks now idle at
washington the material will be loaned
to the educational institutions officially
but unofficially it is agreed that they will
not be withdrawn from their new peace-
time uses unless an unexpected demand
should be made upon the nations arse-
nals and munition factories

  in a letter to a washington official
familiar with the new project doctor
david snedden president of the national
society of vocational education gave his
unqualified approval to the plan but
asked for more information as to the
provisions for distributing the machinery
he said that while none of the colleges
and universities that had given of their
time and equipment for the training of
soldiers during the war expected to have
such equipment replaced it would be a
welcome assistance from the government

 one of the greatest benefits of the
new plan it was explained by vocational
school teachers who are supporting it is
that it would permit the entire nation to
reap big profits from the use of these
machines
