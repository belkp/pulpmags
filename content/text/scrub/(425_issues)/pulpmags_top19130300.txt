   iiow to save the ijj-es is the title of a free
book which should be in the hands of every one
it gives a plain and concise description of eye
troubles and tells how to remedy the evil of wear-
ing eye-glasses if you have rheumatism or any
other disease you take treatment for it but when

a pair of eye-glasses which act only as a crutch
and the longer you wear eye-glasses the worse
your eyes become they only give temporary re-
lief hye-strain is a disease just the same as any
other disease and instead of rushing to buy a
pair eye-glasses if -our eyes were properly treated
you would not require them kve-glasses are un-
sightly and you should not wear them without first
doing everything in your power to avoid them
dr corish the eminent physician has written an
instructive and intensely interesting book which

deafness

successfully treated

by the simplest method yet discovered

  ninety-five percent of the cases of deafness brought
to our attention are the result of chronic catarrh of the
throat and middle ear the air passages become clogged
by catarrhal deposits stopping the action of the vibratory
bones until these deposits are removed relief is impos-
sible the inner ear can-
not be reached by prob-
ingor spraying hence the
inability of specialises
to always give relief
neither can ear drums
cure deafness that
there is a successful
treatment for deafness
p and catarrh is deinon-
strated every day by the
use of actia the
vapor generated in the
actina passes through
the eustachian tubes
into the middle ear re-
moving the catarrhal
obstructions and loosens

ing trouble for years to be relieved by a few weeks use
acuna has also been very successful in the treatment

chapter i

struck in the night

ith muscles tense and legs
spread wide apart bob bain-
bridge found himself crouch-
ing in the middle of the office
shanty it was yet dark and
in his ears still seemed to sound the dull
rumbling detonation which had made
him leap from the bunk before he was
even half awake for a second the
stillness was absolute then from the
other side of the small room came a
hoarse shaking whisper

 bobby what the dickens was
that 

the young man drew a long breath

ia

and an instant later the flame of a
match split the darkness

  dont know john he answered
hastily lighting a candle it sounded a
lot like-dynamite 

  he set the candle down on a rough
table and reaching for one high spiked
shoe began swiftly to drag it on from
the bunk across the room came a stifled
gasp of dismay and a short stout mid-
dle-aged man with a heavy square face
and deep-set blue eyes rolled forth into
the uncertain wavering light and sat
for an instant staring at his companion

  dynamite he repeated in a tone
of consternation you dont mean to
say-

  i dont mean to say anything was


top-notch magazine

the crisp reply as bainbridge tied the
leather lacings with a jerk and reached
for the other shoe i only know it
sounded like dynamite to me and peo-
ple dont usually set that off at three in
the morning-for fun

  john tweedy delayed no longer
with an agility surprising in one so
bulky he fairly flung himself at the pile
of outer garments lying on a near-by
box and when bainbridge a couple of
minutes later jerked open the door to
plunge forth into the night the stout
man was clos at his heels

  quickly as they had acted there were
others equally swift the windows of
the big bunk house across the clearing
glowed faintly and they had no more
than reached the open before the door
was flung wide tc eject a crowd of men
fully dressed in the garb of the lumber
country they were headed by griggs
foreman of the drive tall lean with
a tanned impassive countenance which
betrayed nothing he glanced for a sec-
ond toward the approaching pair and
then fell into step with bainbridge

  well queried the latter crisply
what is it harvey the dam

  the foremans eyes narrowed and
under the drooping lids seemed to
gleam dully

  i dont know what else he said
listen

  for a second bainbridge stood still
head thrust slightly forward in the di-
rection of his foremans pointing fin-
ger behind him was the thud and clat-
ter of men still pouring from the bunk
house mingled with the bustle of those
already in the open chafing at the delay
and impatient to reach the scene of
action the wdnd was blowing half a
gale from the north but above it all
could be heard-faintly intermittently
-the distant ominous roar of rushing
water

  it brought bobs teeth together with
a click but not in time to cut off a sav-
age exclamation then he turned and
started down the slope toward the
south followed closely by the entire
crowvd

  the hillside was dotted thick with

stumps and great piles of tops and
slashings the resinous green un-
withered masses of pine branches as
well as the whiteness of stump ends and
scattered chips showed the cutting to
have been lately done it had in fact
been completed scarcely a month be-
fore  the last load of timber had been
sent down the short narrow stream to
chebargo lake wtithin the past twelve
hours and at the thought of that great
drive of logs held in place by the many
booms until the moment came for it to
be sent down the river to the mills
bobs jaw hardened and his face took
on an expression of tense anxiety and
suspense

  still he did not speak griggs was at
one elbow tweedy at the other both
puffing a little but moving with unex-
pected ease and agility behind at a
lope came the throng of husky woods-
men

  at the foot of the hill bainbridge
swerved sharply to the left along the
narrow stream a space had been
cleared through the undergrowth for a
rough road diversified by protruding
roots and bowlders bog holes and
stretches of corduroy leading across
swampy places the rush of water
sounded clearer now and more distinct
and presently unable longer to restrain
himself bob broke into a run

  up and down slopes and hillocks in
and out of hard-wood groves he sped
behind him the thud of many feet
pounding on the frozen ground mingled
with quickening breaths and an occa-
sional muttered imprecation then sud-
denly the whole crowd racing up the
side of a knoll which overlooked the
upper end of the lake stopped abruptly
with an odd concerted gasp

  below them lay the lake bed-for it
was a lake no longer in spite of the
darkness the starlight showed bain-
bridge quite enough to make him give a
low groan of dismay and fury

  the lake was an artificial one some
two miles long by three-quarters wide
formed for the purpose of facilitating
the handling of bainbridge  tweedys
huge chebargo cut the dam had been
constructed only the summer before un-
when titans drive



der bobs personal supervision and was
equipped with the latest thing in patent
locked gates to prevent any possible
meddling with the head of water

  evidently however these had proved
insufficient in the present instance out
in the center of the lake bed a swiftly
diminishing flow of water was vanish-
ing toward the dam in five minutes at
most nothing would be left save the
narrow crooked stream curving be-
tween slopes of mud along the face
of these slopes sprawled the massive
useless booms of logs which had been
designed and constructed to hold in
check the great drive of timber that now
towered over and behind them stranded
high and dry beyond the possibility of
human interference

  bob paused here only a minute or
two before starting on toward the loca-
tion of the dam he realized perfectly
the futility of such a move he knew
as well as if they were looking upon
the ruin that the dam had been de-
stroyed or rendered utterly useless
the mere opening of the gates could
have no such far-reaching effect as this
nevertheless he felt that he must see
it with his own eyes before he could
bring himself to plan for the future
and so he kept on

  he was right of course they found
the concrete structure utterly ruined
more than half its surface had been
blown away leaving a great gaping
ragged fissure through which the water
must have rushed a veritable flood
long before that could be repaired the
spring freshets would have ceased en-
tirely it would be a physical impossi-
bility to bring the head of water back to
its original level until next season the
great drive of finest white pine stranded
back in that mudhole was doomed to
lie there a prey to rot and destructive
boring insects for the better part of a
twelvemonth and in the end was quite
likely to prove an almost total loss

  such a catastrophe would be a serious
blow to any firm no matter how great
their resources might be to a concern
whose credit had already been strained
almost to the breaking point it would
quite likely mean ruin

chapter ii

the indomitable spirit

country gasped tweedy sud-
denly clenching a fat fist and
shaking it fiercely sixty thousand
dollars gone to pot how in thunder
can you stand there bobby and not say
a word dont you realize that near
half our seasons work is lost that
timber cant be got out this year any
way you think of an by next spring
the logsll be so full o worms they wont
be worth touching hardly its crane
and his gang thats put one over on us
the trusts been after us ever since you
started that reform racket and now
theyve got us good 

  the stout man fairly choked in the
excess of his fury thrusting a purpling
face close to bainbridges

  its sixty thousand dollars as good
as thrown into the gutter he sputtered
for the love of heaven bobby cant
you wake up and say something

  the young mans gaze turned slowly
from where it had been resting thought-
fully on that last wrecked boom with
the shadowy masses of logs sprawling
behind it and he moved his shoulders
impatiently

  whats the use in saying anything
until theres something to say he in-
quired with some tartness im not
quite a fool john i know cranes
turned a rotten trick which is going to
cripple us badly im trying to think of
a way out

  humph grunted tweedy despond-
ently there aint any that i can see
i tell you son every penny of that sixty
is gone beyond the reach of anybody
not quite bob said curtly turning
to griggs whats it cost a thousand
to bark white pine harvey about a
dollar isnt it

  round that nodded the foreman
that cuts out any danger from bor-
ers doesnt it bainbridge continued
briskly

  sure

  bobs eyes narrowed and his well-
shaped mouth grew firmer he glanced
again at tweedy and raised his eye-
brows


top-notch magazine

  thats all there is left for us to do
-eh john he said quickly and even
the not particularly sensitive tweedy
was aware of a ringing undercurrent in
his voice well bark em at once and
ill send down to bangor for men and
material to repair the dam harvey
will look after all that and well save
three-quarters at least of the value of
the drive in spite of cranes dirty
work

  that may be true enough retorted
the older man dispiritedly but do you
realize wrhat its going to mean to lose
the use of that capital for a whole
year 

  he stepped closer to his young part-
ner and lowered his voice to a whis-
per 

  you know the condition were in
financially bob this campaign of
yours against graft has cost us money
-bunches of it our resources have
never been so low this loss is going
to cripple us in a wray which even the
officials of the trust with all their
means of finding out things cant guess
it may be impossible even to get credit
and i dont see how on earth were go-
ing to get through the year without
something-

  weve got to bobs voice was
hard and determined cant you see
thats just what cranes after hes
done this to draw our sting and leave us
helpless well have to weather the
storm somehow john ill be hanged if
ill let that crowd of crooks have their
way weve got the biggest stock of
manufactured lumber in years-thats
one good thing the other is our me-
gantic drive once thats down at the
mills we ought to be in fair shape and
able to tell our esteemed former part-
ner and his crowd to go to-halifax

  but twreedy refused to brace up and
look upon the bright side instead of
being cheered and encouraged by bobs
optimistic manner and fighting spirit
his frown deepened and his lips
drooped still farther at the corners

  once its at the mills-yes he re-
torted significantly what guarantee
have we got that itll ever get there
you dont suppose for a minute theyre

going to let that alone do you after
what theyve done here

  bainbridge flung back his head his
dark eyes glittering

  no but theyre welcomc to try their
darndest he exclaimed they cant
turn any such trick as this and i mean
to start for the megantic camp as soon
as day breaks ill stick with that drive
till the last log is safe in our mill booms
and if the gang tries any more dirty
work therell be something doing be-
lieve me youd better beat it down
to bangor and arrange about credit
you can do it somehow its going to
be a fight to the finish john- and i
reckon theyll find out before its over
that were not quite the easy marks they
seem to think

  tweedy made no reply save a pessi-
mistic hunch of his pudgy shoulders
it seemed to him that bainbridge was
decidedly underestimating the extent of
the damage done them by the treachery
of those cowardly miscreants who
though actually unknown could not
possibly be other than tools of the hos-
tile and unscrupulous lumber trust

  for practically the entire winter the
firm had been pouring out money in
wages supplies and equipment expect-
ing to clean up large and immediate
profits from as fine a lot of timber as
either of the lumbermen had ever seen
to have the entire drive suddenly
stranded in this manner was like losing
every cent which had been paid out for
twreedy was not at all sure that any-
thing could be saved from the wreck
he had no great faith in the efficacy of
barking it seemed like throwing good
money after bad and he said as much
in very decided terms when they were
back in the office shanty making hur-
ried preparations for instant departure

  he was overruled however by both
bainbridge and griggs who were quite
certain the logs could be saved at an
expenditure of about a fifth of their
value and since bob was in charge of
the woods end of the business the older
man was forced to give in

  there followed during a hasty
breakfast a brief consultation regard-
ing the steps tweedy should take to-
when titans drive



ward getting additional credit at the
same time doing his best of course to
sell at once some of their big stock of
manufactured lumber griggs was
given instructions as to the method of
working and the number of men to
keep then came a hurried farewell
between the two partners

  the sun had scarcely risen above the
fringe of trees around the camp before
tweedy was being driven rapidly to-
ward the nearest railroad station while
bob accompanied only by joe moose
an indian guide was sitting in the stern
of a canoe paddling steadily up che-
bargo stream

chapter iii

more treachery

the megantic drive starting from a

	point some forty miles northwest
of chebargo was already in motion
its course would be down the megantic
stream through several ponds and
lakes into the katahdin river and
thence down the penobscot to the mills
at bangor

  by paddling upstream and making
three portages of less than a mile each
bainbridge and the guide cut off a lot
of distance and struck the megantic be-
tween the second and third lake toward
three in the afternoon

  knowing when pete schaeffer the
drive boss had started bob calculated
that he would have advanced consider-
ably beyond this point and turned the
canoe downstream keeping a close
lookout along the banks for signs which
would inevitably be left by a great
drive

  the country was rough and wild the
stream boiling and tumbling between
rather high rocky banks presently
however these gave place to lower
muddy stretches which bore no single
trace of stranded logs or the tracks
made by the rear crew following along
behind a big drive and sacking thei
river

  it took bob very little time to make
certain of this and his heavy dark
brows came suddenly together above

the bridge of his well-shaped nose a
single emphatic line

  the drive hasnt passed he said
abruptly thrusting his paddle straight
down by the side of the canoe and
stopping the frail craft instantly

  the indian moved slightly and
turned a copper-colored profile over one
shoulder

  him held up above he suggested
mebbe jam

  jam repeated bainbridge sharply
why should there be a jam the
streams straight and wide enough with
a fine head of water the hard parts
come farther down with a boss oh
the job and halfway attending to busi-
ness the drive ought to be down as
far as loon lake by this time

  still frowning he gave a wride pow-
erful sweep of his paddle which headed
the canoe upstream

  besides he went on as the craft
danced along under the impetus of their
sturdy practiced strokes schaeffers
had time to break up half a dozen ordi-
nary jams hes no fool and he knows
his business as well as any man in the
country he knows this high water
cant last much longer and that were
altogether dependent on it till we reach

the penobscot if he-

 a sudden extremely unpleasant
thought made the speaker break off
abruptly with a swift catching of his
breath his frown deepened into a
scowl and a touch of angry red glowed
under the clear healthy tan of his clean-
cut face

  mebbe him no care about making
hurry remarked the indian coolly
without even glancing around mebbe
him like to see drive hang up

  the extraordinary manner in which
the guides comment chimed in with his
own mental process fairly took bobs
breath away he hesitated for an in-
stant wondering whether the indian
knew anything special or whether his
remark had been prompted by mere
guesswork knowing moose for many
years bainbridge had never been quite
able to determine whether the man was
attached to him personally as some-
times in his stolid self-restrained man-


top-notch magazine

tier he seemed to be it was more
likely to be simply the canny shrewd-
ness of the native knowing on which
side his bread was buttered at all
events bob had never counted on it
to the extent of any great familiarity
though under the conditions in which
they were frequently alone together in
the woods he could scarcely help let-
ting down the bars a little

  what makes you say that  he
asked suddenly making up his mind
what earthly reason could pete
schaeffer have for wanting to see the
drive hang up hes been offered a
bonus for every extra day he gains in
landing the logs at the mill booms
the square buckskin-covered shoul-
ders hunched again mebbe not offer
nuff retorted the indian stolidly
mebbe he get more to hang up drive
who the deuce are you talking
about joe inquired bainbridge crisp-
ly who would pay him to play a
dirty trick like that 

  the guide slowly turned his head
and regarded bob with a sort of impas-
sive significance

  big punch know wrho he retorted
briefly

  perhaps i do perhaps not bobs
tone was decidedly impatient any-
how lets have the name and see if we
agree

 huh grunted moose wearily
him crane pete he great friends
with cranes man klock

  bainbridges jaw dropped and un-
consciously he drove his paddle deep
down into the current checking the
canoe for a moment or two

  bill kollock he exploded in angry
amazement do you know what youre
talking about joe

  the indian grinned faintly

  sure joe see em in sloon in ban-
gor heap many times ver friendly
come to petes camp yonder five-six
days ago see klock goin away

  bobs face was scarlet with rage and
the eyes fastened upon the guides im-
passive countenance flashed

  you did did you he cried angrily
why didnt you tell me then you
talk a lot about being a friend of mine

why didnt you put me wise to all this
before

  big punch no ask of klock
replied the indian joe think he no
care think he pull klocks stinger
last month when find him out

   bainbridges lips parted for a vitri-
olic retort closed with a snap and he
resumed his paddling in silence after
all the fellow was not to blame for
possessing the characteristic indian
quality of reticence knowing his
habit of wandering all over the north-
ern part of the state bob should have
questioned him the instant the indian
-set foot in chebargo camp the day be-
fore

  but questioned him for what pur-
pose  up to five minutes ago not the
slightest suspicion of pete schaeffer
had ever entered his employers head
the man had worked for them a num-
ber of years he was quiet and taci-
turn sometimes almost sullen but few
woodsmen have much to say for them-
selves he had proved himself more
than competent and was apparently
faithful to the interests of those who
paid his wages

   faithful so long as it suited his pur-
pose and no longer said bainbridge
under his breath the minute the
trust gets after him to do its dirty work
hes perfectly willing to knife us i
can hardly wait to get at the cur

  he was obliged to postpone that
gratification a good deal longer than he
had expected however though they
strained every effort and sent the canoe
fairly flying upstream the sun sank
lower and lower without the slightest
sign of the drive appearing

   with every thousand feet of progress
bob grew more raging when at length
the sun dipped behind the cold gray
distant hill line he was filled with a hot
furious anger against the treacherous
schaeffer-an anger which needed
every ounce of will power he possessed
to suppress

  determined to find the drive and
have a settlement that night he stub-
bornly continued to paddle long after
darkness had fallen and when they
could not see much more than a boat
when titans drive



length in any direction at length
however there was forced upon him a
realization of his folly it would be
much wiser to land now and camp con-
tinuing the journey at daybreak rather
than try to make headway through this
pitchy blackness

  still reluctant to pause bob milled
this over in his mind for ten minutes
or more before finally giving the word
to moose who had made no comment
of any sort the indian obeyed stolid-
ly driving the canoe toward the right
bank within five minutes the two men
were hunting dry sticks for a fire

  later as he sat relaxed before the
grateful blaze consuming the rough
supper ith an appetite which only life
in those wonderful north woods can
give bainbridge remained preoccupied
his forehead wrinkled thoughtfully and
his brooding eyes fixed upon the danc-
ing flames

chapter iv

the jam ox megantic

there was no time lost either in
 turning in that night or in rising
next morning so early was bainbridge
astir that the cold gray half-light dawn
had barely begun to lighten the velvety
blackness the two men had embarked
and were paddling vigorously upstream
before it was possible to see more than
the vague indistinct shadows of con-
crete things

  bobs rage at the treachery of his
trusted drive boss had not lessened
greatly there was mingled with it
however a bitter hatred for the man
higher up and a dogged determination
not only to thwart elihu crane in his
attempt to ruin the independent firm
but to carry the war into the enemies
camp with a zest and vim which his
more or less impersonal blocking of the
lumber trusts game had hitherto
lacked

  before sunrise they had reached and
crossed the first of the three lakes
which was little more than a good-sized
pond two miles northwest of the in-
let another stream almost as large
joined the megantic the juncture was

scarcely passed before bainbridge be-
came aware of the slackening current
and unnaturally low level of water in
the stream something was holding it
back and that something could be noth-
ing less than a jam of unusual size and
extent

  bobs eyes narrowed ominously and
three deep vertical lines flashed sud-
denly into view above the straight nose
downstream there were several spots
which had always been more or less
dreaded by river drivers there all
the skill and care in the world could
not always prevent trouble to the
northward however was comparative-
ly clear sailing the most ordinary
skill in driving and just average atten-
tion to business would make the form-
ing of a jam impossible

  bob set his teeth and drove the canoe
ahead swiftly he made no comment
nor did the guide for ten minutes or
so they paddled in silence bainbridge
was quite aware that under ordinary
conditions such a proceeding would
have been foolhardy to a degree for
all he knew the jam might be started at
any moment the swirling tumbling
logs might sweep down upon them with
irresistible force overwhelming them
before they could even reach the shore
but these were not ordinary conditions
having allowed the jam to form with
malicious intent there was not one
chance in a hundred of schaeffers do-
ing anything to break it unless abso-
lutely forced to

  events proved the accuracy of this
judgment some three miles above the
juncture of the two streams the me-
gantic curved suddenly to the westward
almost at a right angle narrowing
around the bend to less than two-thirds
its usual width it was at this narrow
spot that bainbridge expected to find
the jam and before they had circled
the bend he saw above the low fringe
of bushes on the point the jagged bris-
tling line of logs thrust high above the
surface of the choked and dwindling
stream by the tremendous pressure of
well-nigh the whole drive behind it

  there was not the slightest hint of
hesitation or indecision in the manner


top-notch magazine

of bainbridge now he had evidently
made up his mind exactly what course
to take and he proceeded to take it
without delay his face was no longer
impatient or angry but stern and de-
termined while his black eyes gleamed
with satisfaction that the tedious delay
was over at last and he could begin to
act

  speaking briefly in a low tone to the
indian he turned the canoe inshore and
drove the bow deftly up on the gently
sloping bank giving moose a hand in
carrying the light craft well back into
the bushes bainbridge straightened up
and pushed through the undergrowth
toward the scene of action

  from the location of the jam came
the sound of intermittent clinking as
of peavies languidly applied mingled
with it was a vast deal of loud talk and
raucous laughter which brought bobs
lips together tightly and made him
flush darkly under his tan he uttered
not a word of comment even to him-
self his muscular fists were clenched
as he strode on

  though he made not the slightest ef-
fort at concealment conditions were
such that his approach was entirely un-
noticed passing swiftly through the
bushes with the indian close behind he
reached the other side and paused for
a moment staring intently at the scene
before him

  from this viewpoint the jam looked
much more serious and far-reaching
than from below it seemed like some
huge abatis bristling with spikes and
holding in place a vast expanse of tum-
bled timber piled up and mingled to-
gether in inextricable confusion a
greenhorn unused to lumbering condi-
tions would have said at once that no
human power could possibly break up
this terrific tangle bainbridges prac-
ticed eye ranging swiftly from right to
left and back again to the breast of the
jam saw instantly that affairs were
serious indeed but far from being hope-
less

  he looked for schaeffer but at first
he could see nothing of the person who
was supposed to have charge of opera-
tions there were in sight some sev-

enty or eighty men fully half of whom
were gathered on the near bank loung-
ing in groups laughing talking smok-
ing or sprawling at full length in
the sun luxuriating in its increasing
warmth scattered over the jam were
the remainder of the crew making a
half-hearted pretense-at working which
could not possibly deceive any one as
he watched one after another of them
dally with a peavey in an indolent pur-
poseless kind of way smoking a ciga-
rette the while and carrying on a jocu-
lar sort of repartee with neighbors
bainbridge felt swelling within him the
fury he had so long suppressed but
which seemed now as if it must find ex-
pression

  he was about to step impetuously
from the undergrowth and wake up
that crowd with a volley of vigorous
english when a figure appeared at the
entrance of one of the tents pitched a
little way back from the water at the
sight of this person the watcher held
himself motionless a gleam of intense
satisfaction flashing into his eyes

  the man was tall and lean and nar-
row-loined with wide muscular shoul-
ders his face was rather rough hewn
and the heavy black brows gave him a
lowering almost sullen look there
was however no lack of strength and
intelligence of a certain sort in his ex-
pression one would never have called
him stupid even though hissappearance
might not seem particularly prepossess-
ing

  he stood for a second or two staring
at the jam and that throng of men
playing at work without changing his
expression a particle then he strolled
slowly down toward the crowd hands
thrust into his pockets and lithe body
swaying easily from side to side in the
manner of one having all the time there
is

  his course led him along the edge of
the bushes and bainbridge waited his
coming with poorly restrained impa-
tience the mans complacency infuri-
ated him and yet he was wise enough to
realize that now was the time of all
others when it was absolutely necessary
to hold himself in hand he stood
when titans drive



there lips tightly pressed together and
nails digging into the palms of his
hands until the foreman was almost
opposite then he stepped suddenly
forth

  i seem to- have arrived at a very
opportune moment schaeffer he said

  the man gave a barely perceptible
start and stopped with a jerk for an
instant he stared at bainbridge the dull
red creeping slowly up from the open
collar of his flannel shirt then his thin
lips curled in a smile which held little
mirth in it

  quite a surprise youve given us
mr bainbridge he drawled didnt
expect you around for a week yet

  bobs eyes blazed dangerously but
his voice was steady and cold as ice

  thats veiy evident he retorted
curtly with a swift side glance at the
jam

  schaeffer moved his shoulders slight-
ly and his lids drooped a little other-
wise he entirely ignored bainbridges
meaning

  yes we got in a bit o trouble here
he said coolly but it aint anything
very serious now that the boys are all
here to git after it well have her pullin
in great shape before you can say jack
robinson

  bainbridge took a single step for-
ward bringing his flushed and angry
face close to schaeffers

  dont think for a minute you can
bluff me with that sort of rot schaef-
fer he said in a voice which held in
it the essence of concentrated fury
ive been standing here for ten min-
utes watching whats going on out there
i never yet had a man who was fool
enough to let a drive hang up at this
bend unless he wanted to get me
im wise to everything and the sooner
you pack your duffle bag and beat it
out of here the better itll be for you

  schaeffers face had turned a brick
red and his eyes were glittering dan-
gerously for a second bainbridge
thought the man meant to pour out a
furious stream of profane abuse in-
stead of that however he turned sud-
denly and his gaze swept keenly over
the throng of men each one of who had

become aware of the newcomers pres-
ence and was watching the altercation
with frank curiosity and interest

  so im fired am i  inquired
schaeffer in an oddly gentle voice and
without glancing at bainbridge fired
without a chance to say a word in my
own defense 

  you are retorted bob crisply as
for saying anything in your own de-
fense you may as well save your
breath i havent the time or the in-
clination to listen to lies youve played
the traitor and been found out and if
anybody ever asks why i let you go
theyll get the truth-no more no less
that so  murmured schaeffer idly
moving a small pebble with the toe of
his heavy spiked shoe i wonder
now 

  without the slightest warning or pre-
liminary movement of any sort he
whirled and smashed bob square in the
face with every ounce of strength he
possessed bainbridge staggered by
the force and unexpectedness of it
stumbled back tripped and struck the
ground with a crash the drive boss
leaped forward his face distorted with
passion and delivered a fierce slashing
kick straight at the prostrate mans
groin

chapter v

fighting foul

ljalf stunned though he was bob
still had the wit to fling himself
swiftly to one side and he did so with
such quick intuitive agility that the
long sharp spikes of schaeffers shoe
barely grazed the flesh of his thigh

  bob bainbridges brain was cleared
with the thoroughness and rapidity of
an electric shock he leaped to his feet
just as the foreman tripped over joe
mooses deftly extended foot and
crashed headlong to the ground

  get up you cur cried bainbridge
as he jerked off the encumbering mack-
inaw and tossed it from him get up
and take whats coming to you

  he was filled with the suddep fierce
elemental joy of physical combat for


top-notcii magazine

what seemed an eternity he had been
holding himself in check by sheer will
power and now the relief of handling
with bare fists this fellow who had
played such a contemptible trick upon
him was indescribable

  schaeffer was on his feet like a cat
and came at bainbridge with a rush
bob side-stepped swinging with his
right at the drive boss ribs to his as-
tonishment the blow was blocked with
the cleverness of a professional an
instant later schaeffer whirled like a
dervish and again his opponent felt the
tearing of those spikes in the flesh of
his left leg as he went staggering to
both knees

  the surprise of discovering that
schaeffer could box scientifically was
undoubtedly what checked bob and
gave the fellow a chance to get in that
second foul kick the touch of those
spikes the realization that a man who
could fight fairly and squarely was low
enough to resort to such disgraceful
tactics made bainbridge see red
whether the indian interfered again in
his behalf he could not tell he only
knew that he was on his feet once more
fighting instinctively and fairly over-
whelming his opponent with a series of
rushes which there was no withstand-
ing schaeffer blocked them as best he
could depending a lot on clever foot-
work and waited for his chance it
seemed certain that bainbridge would
soon let up and take things easier and
then it would be possible for the tricky
riverman to use some of the other fouls
of which lie seemed to be a master

  the moment bob came to his senses
he did cut down his steam consider-
ably no human being could keep up
that speed for any length of time and
hope for victory and bainbridge meant
to be victorious in this struggle even
though schaeffer possessed the skill of 
a champion he must be beaten in some
way for the thought of succumbing to
a treacherous cur like this was intoler-
able

  the fight which followed was a
strange one bainbridge had never
known anything like it in all his varied
experience as a boxer his opponent

possessed exceptional skill in the art he
would in fact have been a hard man
to defeat in the conventional ring add
to this a knowledge of fouling which
was simply extraordinary and it will
be seen what sort of an antagonist he
was

  the mere mental strain involved was
exhausting xot only had bob the
thousand legitimate devices of the ring
to look out for but he never knew when
to expect a vicious jab below the belt
or a nasty butt from the head and al-
ways in the back of his mind was a fear
that those murderous spikes might at
any moment strike deeply maimingly
at the vital spot for which they had
been aimed twice before

  by this time of course every river
hog within sight had raced up and the
combatants were surrounded by a ring
of eager spectators several deep which
swayed and moved and billowed out
elastically as the fight progressed a
number of them were evidently in sym-
pathy with schaeffer and kept urging
him to go in and win but the majority
remained silent save for occasional mut-
tered ejaculations when a particularly
clever or vicious blow struck home
moose his small black eyes glistening
but otherwise as stolid and unmoved as
ever managed constantly to retain his
position in the front row

  for a long time bainbridge kept his
opponent in hand always the strain of
waiting expecting planning to meet the
unknown foul was uppermost in his
mind to the exclusion of almost every-
thing else he knew in an intuitive sort
of way that he was fighting well he
had landed several blows which stag-
gered the man and the fellows face
from which bob never for an instant
withdrew his eyes was cut and bleed-
ing that proved little however he
was evidently the sort that could take
any amount of punishment and come
up for more his wind seemed to be
quite as good as bobs and at length the
latter was conscious of a single flash of
doubt regarding the issue

  what if he should not win as he had
determined in the beginning what if
schaeffer should by fair means or foul
when titans drive



manage to knock him out it would
not be like an ordinary knock-out-sim-
ply the end of a fairly fought contest to
decide which of two men is the better
scrapper he would be helpless for a
space and in the power of this cur who
had thus far stopped at nothing moose
could accomplish little on his behalf
when opposed by the crowd of specta-
tors all of whom seemed from what
bainbridge had caught of their com-
ments to be on schaeffers side

  the thought of what might happen
was not a pleasant one and possibly it
was that which led to bainbridges un-
doing he had so far instinctively
avoided clinches as being favorable to
fouls but now with his mind for a sec-
ond partially distracted after delivering
a left-hand jab he did not spring back
as swiftly as he might have done the
riverman took instant advantage of the
chance and leaped forward gripping
bobs wrist in an instant bainbridge
had wrenched it away but not too soon
to prevent that close contact which he
felt to be so dangerous

  hell try something dirty now
flashed through bobs brain i knew
it no you dont-now

  just in time he saw schaeffers left
knee suddenly jerked up and forward
like a flash he leaped to one side his
whole mind intent on thwarting the in-
tended trick and so he fell for a move
which would never ordinarily have
bothered him

  a clenched fist hard and compact al-
most as a stone thudded solidly on the
very point of his jaw bainbridge went
suddenly limp slipping noiselessly to
the ground

chapter vi

the finish unexpected

as bob toppled forward and lay still
a long deep concerted sigh of re-
leased tension arose from the specta-
tors followed by a chorus of admiring
commendation these rough-and-ready
river hogs saw nothing unfair in their
foremans method of fighting the
woods rules of combat are simple get

your man is the principle one the
manner of getting docs not count

  nice work pete called one
pretty

  good for you old buck you put
him to sleep fine 

  schaeffer made no reply to these
comments in fact it is doubtful if he
heard them his face torn and bleed-
ing in many places bore an expression
of utter savagery his cut lips were
drawn back over sharp teeth in a bes-
tial snarl his fists were clenched tight-
ly and every muscle was tense as he
stood glaring down with hate-filled
bloodshot eyes at the body of his fallen
opponent

  you meddling dog he snarled vi-
ciously after a momentary silence
thought you could lick me did you
thought you could put one over on me
you skunk well you got yours an i
aint done with you yet not by a long
shot

  he took a single swift step toward
the prostrate man it was plain to
every one that he meant- to drive that
heavy spiked boot again and again at
the helpless body yet not one of the
rivermen uttered a word of protest a
number of faces expressed disapproval
but in the big woods if a man chooses
to end a combat in this manner it isnt
etiquette to interfere

  schaeffer paused beside the prostrate
figure for a second or two as if to pro-
long his pleasurable anticipation then
with a sudden snarl of returning fury
he swiftly drew back one foot

  stop

 the word which came snapping
across the circle held in it so much of
the essence of command that the river-
man obeyed instinctively obeyed and
then realizing what he had done
foamed with a fresh fury

  why you copper-colored whelp
he exploded glaring darkly at the im-
perturbable redskin ait when i
get through with this junk here-

  he stopped abruptly and drew his
breath with a whistling sound joe
moose wras moving leisurely toward
him a most efficient-looking revolver

pointed casually at the riverraans stom-
ach he halted within a few feet of
schaeffer and stood regarding him with
that cool expressionless stare which
was so characteristic on the ground
between them bainbridge gave a low
groan and moved his head uneasily
from side to side

  fight not finish remarked the in-
dian blandly bell go clang like in
ring heap soon big punch get up
start nother round get me steve

  schaeffer took an involuntary step
backward his face distorted

  somebody get busy an put this
lunatic out o business he roared glar-
ing around at the ring of interested
faces bury a lead slug in his worth-
less carcass where itll do the most
good

  the guide was bending over his
friend vigorously chafing one limp
hand

  better not he advised coolly with-
out raising his eyes joes gun go off
plenty quick hit pete in bread basket
make plenty bad hole no cork up

  his weapon was still aimed directly
at the discomfited rivermans person
and schaeffer seemed for the moment
bereft of ideas for a proper retort the
silence was swiftly broken by a loud
guffaw from one of the spectators to
whom the whole affair seemed to ap-
peal as something uncommonly amus-
ing

  by thunder boys he chuckled
hanged if the flea-bitten old cuss aint
right the kids cornin around fast i
move we call this the end o the first
round an let the fight go on itll help
pass the time away if nothin else

  schaeffer snapped out an angry ex-
postulation but the indians idea
seemed to take with the rough-and-
ready crowd not one of them thought
for an instant that the contest could
possibly be drawn out for more than
a few minutes longer or they would
perhaps not have been so eager as it
was however they took the indians
part with a rough sort of jocularity
which the irritated drive boss knew bet-
ter than to oppose

  and so when bainbridge struggled

back to consciousness-it had not been
a complete knock-out and he had
never save for the briefest second been
entirely senseless-he found this unex-
pected condition of affairs

  as his glance flashed past the in-
dians inquiring black eyes and came to
rest on schaeffers sullen hate-filled
face he made a queer inarticulate noise
in his throat and tried to scramble up
moose placed a firm restraining hand
quietly on his chest and forced him
back

  take easy he whispered plenty
time big punch lie stim get wind

  bob was no more anxious for this de-
lay than was his complaining antago-
nist but he was forced by moose to
keep his place even to a point when the
spectators began to grumble when at
last he was allowed to get on his feet
howtever he was more than thankful
for the redskins wisdom even now
his legs were not quite steady the
dragging lassitude and weakness which
had gripped him were not wholly gone

  it vanished an instant later before
that rush of vim and vigor and fierce
determination-strange as the second
wind which surprises the distressed
runner-that suddenly came over fiim

  he waited schaeffers savage charge
instead of meeting it waited with a
cunning pretense of weakly swaying on
his heels but when the riverman was
almost on him he side-stepped neatly
lashing out a stinging right which
caught his antagonist on one cheek and
sent him spinning around

  that blow was the beginning of the
end in itself it was nothing but it
marked a vital change in bainbridges
method of fighting hitherto his work
had been clever boxing to be sure but
just a trifle lacking in that dynamic en-
ergy which animated his opponent the
sense of fight convention wras so strong-
ly ingrained that without conscious-
ness of so doing he was playing accord-
ing to the rules

  now though he lost not a particle of
his former skill he used the defensive
part of it less he did not parry or
block or feint so much his work be-
came more simple more elemental and
when titans drive



-more deadly he was out for results
now the hot blood tingled through
his veins and flamed into his brain the
crude brute lust for combat gripped
him to the exclusion of all else this
man had hurt him cruelly and humili-
ated him beyond words he meant to
make him pay and pay well for both
these injuries the only difference now
between himself and his opponent was
that he continued to fight fairly if fero-
ciously while schaeffer did not

  the latter found little opportunity of
fouling however to his amazement
he discovered that he needed every bit
of skill and strength he possessed to
keep his feet bob bored into him re-
lentlessly slugging like a pile driver
hammering at his stomach raining well-
directed blows on the heart and kid-
neys or varying them now and then
with a solid jolt to the jaw

  at first- schaeffer met this extraor-
dinary assault with blind confidence in
his ability to wear it out accompanied
by a furious anger at the presumption
of the man but swiftly this mental at-
titude changed to doubt nervousness-
at length to fear

  it was all so pitilessly indomitable so
machinelike yet not at all mechanical
that schaeffer began to grow afraid
he had a yellow streak of course-men
of his stamp usually have-and now it
began to come out his defense grew
weaker and more flurried bainbridges
punches struck home with increasing
strength and frequency once after a
series of swift smashing blows in the
face schaeffer staggered back and
dropped his guard involuntarily bob
was following up with a straight body
punch but his cracked and bleeding fist
stopped less than an inch it seemed
from his opponents heaving chest

  tut up your hands you cur he
panted harshly this fight isnt over
yet put em up and get busy

  a second later having obeyed inef-
fectually schaeffer was flung back into
the astonished crowd by a jolt which
nearly cracked his jaw

  let up on him suddenly cried one
of the men who had been particularly
eager earlier in the game in urging

schaeffer to the attack hes had
enough i says time to quit an have
done with it

  bainbridge flung back a long lock of
black hair with a quick jerk of his head
and glared around the circle with fierce-
ly blazing eyes

  is that so he jeered whos run-
ning this game  i didnt hear any talk
like that when i was getting the worst
of it you were ready enough to let
him do what he liked with me so keep
out of this now while he takes his medi-
cine

  his glance veered swiftly to schaef-
fers face looking like a chalky mask
dabbled with crimson and he thrust his
head forward

  well he sneered scared are
you  i thought you were yellow down
at the bottom put up your hands
his voice was hard and cold and utter-
ly pitiless im not half done with
you yet

  the mans exhausted almost pitiful
condition did not move him in the
slightest he thought only of the fel-
lows treachery of the repeated exhibi-
tions of foul play and attempts to maim
and he had no mercy when the river-
man raised his hands in a weak instinc-
tive attempt at defense bainbridge
leaped forward and broke his guard by
smashing blows on the face

  schaeffer gasped cried out in agony
and then thrust forward blind groping
hands he was a picture of utter help-
lessness and suddenly the sight of him
standing there with quivering lips and
trembling hands aroused in bainbridge
a bitter disgust-disgust for schaeffer
for himself and every one in sight

  he stepped back his heavy black
brows contracted in a frown and stood
for a second sizing up his man and de-
ciding just what sort of a punch would
most quickly end the contest like a
flash he leaped forward the blow
started almost at bobs hip and held the
whole compact mass of him behind it
it doubled schaeffer like a jackknife
and sent him whirling backward into
the arms of his men a limp utterly
senseless mass

master of the situation

i jnconsciously bob bainbridge
 stepped back a pace or two and
rested one hand on the shoulder of
moose he was breathing hard and
the reaction from the stress and strain
of vigorous fighting made him feel limp
and unsteady

  no hint of this appeared on the sur-
face with cold unemotional eyes he
watched three or four men pick up the
unconscious schaeffer and carry him
back to the tent

  some of the men stood staring curi-
ously but the majority had gathered
about a brawny youngster handsome in
a physical way with bold blue eyes a
thatch of tawny yellow curls and a
reckless dare-devil manner he was
one of thos who had been readiest to
take schaeffers part and now as he
turned toward bainbridge followed by
a dozen or more of his companions bob
was conscious of a sudden curious
sense of familiarity with the boys face
for a second he thought it simply the
result of a rather good memory this
was his first sight of schaeffers river
gang but it was quite possible he had
run across the rather striking young-
ster at some other time or place

  curiously yet impassively he
watched the latter approach there
was a devil-may-care impudence in the
very swing of his lithe muscular body
when he came to a stop before the lum-
berman hat stuck rakishly on one side
of that yellow thatch and hands resting
lightly on his slim hips his whole man-
ner was one of such cool arrogance that
bobs eyes narrowed and the angry
blood began to tingle again through his
veins

  look here said the fellow inso-
lently that was one dirty trick you
played on pete and youre goin to pay
for it do you know what were goin
to do--

  yes flamed bainbridge in a voice
which made more than one husky river
hog start nervously i do youre
going down to that jam on the jump-
and zvork get me i mean real work

too and not an imitation of kids play-
ing thanks to a crooked drive boss
the logs are hung up -where no drive
ever hung before if youd been half-
way men youd never have let such a
thing happen

  by cripes roared the blond furi-
ously leaping at bob there aint a
man livin as can talk like that to me
an git away with it why you city
dude im going to show you that you

cant-

  cut that

  bainbridge suddenly loosened his
grip on the indians shoulder and
thrust his face squarely into the young
fellows until scarcely six inches sepa-
rated them he said not another word
but something blazed in his black eyes
which presently sent the lids fluttering
down over the blue ones and brought
a touch of dull scarlet flaming dully
beneath the deeply tanned skin it was
simply the force of a stronger nature
a nature untroubled by brag and blus-
ter which imposes its will on others by
sheer strength of character

  the instant the silent duel had ended
bob flung back his head and glanced
again at the puzzled waiting throng of
men

  im bob bainbridge he said in a
crisp unemotional tone which was in
odd contrast to the sense of tension just
passed weve wasted entirely too
much time jawing and its up to you
boys to get a move on that jams got
to be started before sundown under-
stand now wheres the jam boss
jack peters

  laid up explained one of the men
after a moments hesitation he got
his foot near cut off with an ax

  bainbridges eves narrowed this
would be termed an accident of course
but there was no doubt in bis mind that
it was simply another score to the credit
of schaeffer and the men who had
bribed him to do his dirty work

  humph he shrugged wheres
your dynamite then oh youre the
one are you well get your stuff
down to the jam in a hurry how
many charges have been fired already

-- with downcast eyes the riverman ex-
when titans drive



plained that dynamite had not yet been
used bobs lips curled

  i might have guessed it he said
scornfully well hustle along the
canned thunder the rest of you get
ready to follow down the drive

  the men obeyed without question
and in a moment were streaming to-
ward the jam besides command in
bainbridges voice there was optimistic
confidence which stirred these rough-
and-ready river hogs because schaef-
fer ordered it they had dawdled along
fruitlessly for several days knowing
perfectly well that the jam was beyond
any hope from picking and that dyna-
mite was the only thing which would
stir it superficially the had enjoyed
these days of loafing but deep down in
their hearts had lingered a feeling of
personal shame that a gang of suppos-
edly a- lumberjacks should be know-
ingly throwing away their time in this
manner

  the youngster with the bold blue
eyes and curly yellow hair went with
the rest but more slowly perhaps and
biting his lip as he strode away his
face was flushed darkly and his mus-
cular hands tightly clenched at the
thought of having allowed himself to
be called dowrn in this humiliating man-
ner without even a word of retort
even now he did not know why he had
done it the fact that the newcomer
was bob bainbridge was not a thing
entirely to influence his independent
soul there was something else-some
quality in the man himself that had
made him knuckle down as he had
never done before

  puzzled chagrined scowling blackly
he slouched after his comrades hands
thrust deep in trousers pockets and feet
kicking at roots or hummocks-for all
the world like a spoiled sullen school-
boy

  bainbridge was by this time utterly
oblivious to the mans very existence
he had thrust from his mind every
thought save the immediate pressing
need of starting the jam and to this end
he bent every effort

  while jerry calker was making
ready the dynamite cartridges bob

went out on the great mass of logs piled
up like a heap of gigantic jackstraws
and inspected it hastily but thoroughly
it was he who directed the placing of
the first blast and he who was the last
to seek cover he it was who first
rushed to the spot in the very midst of
that shower of bark and splinters and
wood chips raining down after the up-
heaval of timber had subsided

  he saw the whole vast surface of the
jam quiver and heave and for a mo-
ment he hoped the shot nad been suc-
cessful that hope proved groundless
however the jam settled back into
immovability again they would have to
try once more

  the second blast seemed at first to be
no more effective than the other then
bobs keen eye perceived an encourag-
ing variation over the surface of the
jam a curious uneasy motion began to
spread from one log to another the
crew which had run lightly out to the
very face worked swiftly with their
peavies pulling shoving jerking the
timbers this way and that from his
point of vantage bainbridge watched
their work with approval they were
evidently far from being the incompe-
tents that first sight of them might
have led one to suppose he noticed
that the fellow with the curly yellow
hair was particularly skillful having
apparently laid aside his grouch and
taken hold from sheer love of the work
and delight in accomplishing something

  somehow bob could not help follow-
ing his movements for a minute or two
and presently in spite of all that had
gone before his heart began to warm to
the lithe active fearless youngster who
seemed to have the knack of always
being in the right place and doing the
thing most needed at precisely the right
moment

  a good man bainbridge muttered
to himself at length hanged if he
isnt

  but now the jam was actually in mo-
tion crawling forward with many
creaks and crackings the men worked
harder accelerating its progress and
making sure that nothing went wrong
suddenly the whole central part of the

face fell forward into the stream with
a tremendous crash and there was a
whirling backward rush  the part of
those who had been working on the
very brink as they zigzagged to shore
by devious routes they raised the glad-
some cry

  she pulls boys-she pulls

  the sound was as music to bain-
bridges ears but he only smiled grim-
ly and strode rapidly along the bank
of the stream his eyes were fixed on
the foam and spray and rolling rushing
timbers on some of which holding by
their sharp spikes and balancing per-
fectly rode the skilled rivermen who
preferred this methftd to the more pro-
saic one of walking ashore

  one of these was the blond young-
ster and presently reaching a point on
the bend where he thought a man was
needed to prevent fresh jamming bob
beckoned him ashore

  he came-lightly easily-leaping
from log to log or working the one he
temporarily rode nearer the bank by
means of his peavev his last easy
spring brought him to laud beside bain-
bridge where he stood at silent atten-
tion his boldly handsome face begin-
ning to show anew the look of sullen
embarrassment it had momentarily lost

  keep a lookout here for a while
bob said briefly its rather a bad
place by the way he went on struck
afresh by that haunting sense of fa-
miliarity which had come to him be-
fore whats your name

  the young giant dropped his lids and
his muscular fingers interlocked tightly
around the stout ash pole of the peavev

  curly he said in an oddly embar-
rassed tone

  ah that ail

  the youngster hesitated and then
flinging back his head stared defiantly
at bainbridge

  no he retorted its kollock-
curly kollock

  bob frowned slightly indeed any
relation to bill

  his brother

  the frown deepened and there was
silence for a moment bill kollock the
trouble man of elihu crane and his

associates in the lumber trust was not
a character to commend himself to
bainbridge the brother was more
than likely to be of the same breed he
reflected as he stared with hard nar-
rowing eyes at the flushed defiant face

of the youth before him and yet-

  well snapped the boy suddenly
i spose this means git my time
bob raised his eyebrows why so
he inquired coldly

  kollock shrugged his shoulders with
an exaggerated nonchalance and ease
which defeated its purpose

  i dont reckon youre very keen
about having a kollock on your drive
he retorted

  thats where you guess wrong re-
turned bainbridge with a suddenbland
indifference if you want to quit of
course thats your own affair but as
for laving you off i never fire a good
workman because his family doesnt
happen to be to my liking so far as
anything really underhand is concerned
-he paused for a second and looked
the boy square in the eyes-im not
afraid of that-from you

  without waiting for a reply he
turned and strode on along the river
bank leaving young curly to stare after
him his face flushed and a curious un-
wonted expression in his blue eyes

chapter viii

the empty box

as soon as the drive was actually
started on its way downstream
bob made haste to bring some sort of
order out of the chaos he had found
having watched the men at work he
was able to get some slight idea of theij
capabilities which was vitally necessary
in dividing them into the rear and
the jam crew

  the latter in charge of a hastily ap-
pointed foreman went forward to take
charge of the head of the drive the
work of the rear comorised setting

	o

stranded logs afloat breaking up in-
cipient jams and other duties too nu-
merous to mention

the men composing the squad were
always the most skillful and experi-
when titans drive



encecl in the gang they had to be con-
tinually on the alert working usually
at high tension and more than half the
time in icy water to their waists they
had to be able to ride anything in the
shape of a log in any sort of water and
work day after day for twelve and
fourteen hours at a stretch they must
be swift as lightning in their move-
ments and possessed of judgment abil-
ity and nerve

  it was impossible of course for bob
to pick out an ideal rear crew from
merely having  seen the men in action
for a scant few minutes he did not
try he simply used his very excellent
judgment reserving mentally the right
to change his mind whenever he felt
like it and juggle the men around as he
chose	

  the principal necessity was to start
things moving when lie had done so
bainbridge returned to camp with the
twofold object of giving the cook his
orders and having a final settlement
with schaeffer the latter was not par-
ticularly pleasant but it was important
the man must quit the crew at once
bob had made up his mind not to let the
fellow spend even the night where he
would have a chance to talk with and
perhaps influence the others with this
determination uppermost he passed by
the mess tent to the other where the
men slept pulled aside the flap and
stepped inside

  the place was a mess of blankets and
half-dried clothes but to bobs surprise
it was vacant of anything in the nature
of a man evidently schaeffer had re-
covered and vamoosed thoughtfully
he sought the cook and put the ques-
tion

  came in here an got some grub a
full hour ago that servitor explained
briefly when hed eat it he went off
agin

  didnt he say where he was going
bainbridge asked

  the cook shook his head nary
word

  and you didnt happen to see what
direction he took

  nary a sight was the reply i
was busy inside

a

  bob frowned for a second and then
shrugged his shoulders after all what
did it matter where the fellow had gone
so long as he had taken himself away 
it was very natural for him to avoid the
man who had so humiliated him though
it was rather puzzling to have him slip
away without apparently encountering
any one

  bob proceeded to give his orders to
the cook explaining that he would have
to pull up stakes at once and start down
the river

  the boys will be a long way from
here by nightfall he said so youll
have to hustle ive saved out a couple
of men to help you and the cookee
wholl be under your orders till you
pitch camp to-night

  outside the mess tent he hesitated an
instant then he entered the other tent
this time he did not pause by the door
but crossed hastily to the farther cor-
ner where there was a small space
crudely partitioned off from the main
portion this would be schaeffers
sanctum of course and bob entered it
curiously-only to stop with an ex-
clamation of mingled surprise anger
and chagrin

  the place was in the utmost disor-
der blankets were rolled up in a ball
and flung into the corner articles of
wearing apparel were scattered about
while over everything were sifted
scraps of white paper in seemingly end-
less quantity it was these torn scraps
that roused bobs indignation he
seemed to know intuitively without the
evidence of the limp empty book covers
here and there that the foreman had
taken time to tear into shreds every rec-
ord and paper connected with the drive
which he possessed time books scal-
ers measurements-everything had
been destroyed practically beyond the
possibility of reconstruction there
would be no accurate way now by which
the firm could figure their profits or
costs or labor charges the very pay-
ing of the drive crew would be a mat-
ter of guesswork

   jove exclaimed bainbridge
through his clenched teeth i didnt
know a man could be so rotten


top-notch magazine

  he stared at the wreck for a minute
longer and then turned over with his
foot the square wooden box which lay
upset in the middle of the mess ap-
parently it had served schaeffer as a
receptacle for these same records it
was quite empty but underneath lay
something which brought a thoughtful
questioning expression into the search-
ers face and made him stoop to pick
it up

  thirty-eight caliber he murmured
staring at the freshly opened pasteboard
box which had contained fifty car-
tridges hum

  presently he let it drop again he
did not move for a space but stood star-
ing at the ground with that same odd
thoughtful pucker in his forehead

  there was nothing surprising in the
fact of schaeffers being armed
neither was it strange for a man in the
rivermans position to carry off his am-
munition loose instead of in the box
that was not the point it was simply
the train of thought aroused which
struck bainbridge unpleasantly he
felt schaeffer to be capable of almost
any villainy provided it could be accom-
plished with safety to himself the
humiliation of that fight too had added
a powerful incentive to the one already
offered by crane and the lumber
trust for the eclipse of bob bain-
bridge and a total eclipse would be so
easy just a single shot fired from the
bushes at a moment when there was no
one else about to see or hear in this
wild country the chances of escaping
were infinite the man might not even
be suspected

  bob suddenly moved his shoulders
impatiently frowned and turned away
a moment later his eyes twinkled
mirthfully

  another minute and id have the
undertaker picked out he chuckled
the scoundrel hasnt the common
courage to do murder all the same
he added with a decisive squaring of
the shoulders ill put a crimp in his
little game about those records ill have
cookee scrape em all up and ship the
whole bunch down to john that
clerk wiggins can put em together

ill bet patience is his middle name-
patience and picture puzzles well have
the laugh on pete after all-hanged if
we wont

chapter ix

in the swift current

hthe clumsy slow-moving scow
 loaded with the cooks outfit and a
supply of bedding followed the drive
downstream and that night fastened
itp to the bank close to the inlet of deer
pond the middle one of three small
bodies of water strung along the length
of the megantic it was a full days
work much better than bainbridge had
hoped for and as he approached the
big drying fire flaming up at one side
of the camp made by charlie hanley
the cook bob shook his own hand in
silent grinning self-congratulation he
knew that they were far from being out
of the woods yet but a good beginning
always means a lot and he had no word
to say against this start-off

  presently the various driving crews
appeared wet to the skin from the
wraist down and ravenously hungry
the drying racks were swiftly steam-
ing with the soggy garments and the
men fell to upon their supper without a
seconds delay there was little con-
versation-they were too busy for that
but bainbridge noticed with satisfaction
that a certain element of good-tempered
raillery seemed to prevail evidently
the crowd as a whole bore no grudge
against the man who had given them
such a tongue-lashing that morning in
fact if one could judge from their man-
ner toward their boss they thought a
lot more of him for having done so

  next day all hands did even better
and nightfall found them at the inlet of
loon lake with the drive before them
bob could not understand it all day
he had been expecting some disagree-
able happening of a nature to retard
their progress which could be laid at the
door of the trust when it did not come
he was almost disappointed it was im-
possible to believe that crane had given
up so easily he was not that sort he
would explode a bombshell of some sort
when titans drive



soon and the longer he delayed the
more deadly was likely to be the nature
of his attack

  however there was nothing to be
gained in discounting the future nor
time to spare for fretting over the un-
known bob wras far too busy during
the daylight hours even to think of
crane or his satellites it was a ticklish
job to get the drive across even so small
a body of water as the so-called lake
and it took one entire day and the better
part of another it was done without
mishap however and bainbridge was
just congratulating himself on having
got safely over one - of the most dis-
agreeable bits of the entire distance
when jerry calker approached him as
he stood watching the last few logs bob
slowly out of the lake into the swifter
current of the stream

  jack wants to know can you spare
him a few minutes sir he explained
theres a bit of trouble down below

  what kind of trouble bob asked
swiftly turning downstream without an
instants delay and walking by the side
of the dynamite man

  calker scratched his head slowly i
aint quite certain sure mr bain-
bridge he drawled but i got a idea
theres a fellow with a mill whos run
out a sortin boom thats goin to hang
up our drive if we aint mighty keer-
ful

  a mill exclaimed bob incredulous-
ly why there isnt such a thing with-
in twenty miles-at least there wasnt
three months ago

  calker grinned thought it looked
kinda new i couldnt rightly say that
its finished but there aint no manner
of a doubt about the boom the jam
had started before i come awray an i
left jack havin it hot an heavy with a
red-headed son of a gun who sure
looked as if scrap was his middle
name

  bainbridge frowned but asked no
further questions he scarcely spoke
in fact during all of the four miles but
it was evident to his observing compan-
ion that he was doing a lot of thinking

  long before reaching the point of ob-
struction it became evident that another

jam had formed the current grew
more and more sluggish and the prog-
ress of the logs downstream became
slower and slower until at length the
entire surface of the water was cov-
ered with floating timber these in
turn crowded upon one another with a
rapidity which threatened to equal that
first jam unless something was swiftly
done

  hurrying on bob presently caught
up with a throng of his own men who
had apparently just landed from the
dangerous constantly shifting surface
of the river they looked at him with
a frank curiosity as if wondering what
he meant to do in this emergency on
the faces of a few were expressions of
grim anticipatory amusement but
bainbridge heeded these no more than
he had the others without pausing or
even glancing to right or left he strode
on and reached the scene of action

  on the same bank a little way back
from the water stood a small building
so hastily thrown together that the roof
was not yet completed one or twro
men were standing near it staring in-
terestedly at the crowd gathered about
something at the waters edge which
bob at once saw to be one end of a
massive well-constructed log boom
the other end out beyond the middle
of the river was supported by some
stout spiles- and the whole affair took
up so much of the streams width that
bainbridges drive had jammed against
it hard and fast

  all this bob took in without slacken-
ing his pace reaching the outer edge
of the circle he pushed through to
where jack peters his jam boss stood
facing a compact group of six or eight
strangers gathered closely about the
end of the boom jack was florid with
rage and choking with impotent fury
the strangers composing the little
group instantly struck bob as being sin-
gularly strong and rugged they
looked as if they had been picked for
their physical efficiency each one was
armed with rifle or pistol while their
leader a competent-looking person with
red hair and whiskers held in one hand
a snub-nosed businesslike automatic


top-notch magazine

  well jack bainbridge said curtly
as he reached the foremans side
whats the trouble

  before peters could reply the red-
haired man took a single step forward
and faced bob

  i can tell you in two shakes of a
lambs tail he snapped viciously this
river hog o yours thinks he kin play
the devil with my boom but hes got an-
other guess cornin i own this land an
that sawmill i got a right to run my
booms out in the river same as anybody
else i aint lookin for trouble but the
first man as tries any monkey business
wants to look out thats all

  bainbridge raised his eyebrows and
let his gaze wander leisurely from the
mans head to his heels with an expres-
sion which brought an added touch of
color to the already flushed cheeks

  indeed he drawled who are
you

  who be i  retorted the other an-
grily humph i dont see that it
makes no difference but my names
joyce-john joyce an i aint the
kind as backs down an takes water be-
lieve me

  a singularly irritating smile curved
the corners of bobs lips his unruf-
fled composure served as he hoped it
might to increase the rage of mr
joyce

  do you realize that youre obstruct-
ing navigation  he inquired suavely

  i dont admit it snapped joyce
theres plenty of room for your drive
to git past if you had a gang that knew
their business instead of a lot o green-
horns

  i dare say you could give us all
points bainbridge murmured smooth-
ly with just the right inflection of sar-
casm to sting it had suddenly oc-
curred to him that the fellows object
was to make him lose his temper and
thus precipitate a clash during which
almost anything might be accomplished
not only did he refuse to let go his
grip but he did his very best to goad
joyce himself into flaming out and
possibly betraying a few secrets

  thats hardly the question though
he went on swiftly strikes me youve

been rather premature in running out
the boom your mill isnt operating
and i have yet to see a single log com-
ing downstream except our own
never you mind that retorted
joyce hotly do you think a mans go-
ing to wait till his timber comes in sight
afore makin arrangements to take care
of it you cant come over me with no
soft talk like that the booms there
an there it stays half the rivers clear
for you to use an thats all you gets
hum thats your last word is
it inquired bainbridge quietly you
even refuse to let us swing the boom
around so we can break our jam

  i do replied the red-haired indi-
vidual emphatically the first man
that tries to monkey with my property
will wish he hadnt thats all i got to
say

  he raised his automatic significantly
but bob was not even looking at him
the young mans gaze had swept out to
the face of the jam and in an incredibly
short space an accurate picture of its
appearance had been photographed on
his brain still without giving joyce
the satisfaction of a glance he turned
away motioning peters to accompany
him

  a put-up job of course he said
tersely when they were through the cir-
cle of his own men same gang who
bought schaeffer

  the jam boss nodded in a troubled
way im afraid theyve got us bad
too its goin to take one long time
pickin that jam apart but i cant see
anythin else to do i spose id better
start em at it right away sir

  not at all retorted bob swiftly
do nothing of the kind let em stay
just where they are jerry 

  at the sound of his imperative under-
tone calker hustled up there was a
brief interchange of words between the
trio during which the faces of both
lumberjacks brightened amazingly
then all three disappeared into the
bushes a little way upstream from
which they did not emerge for a con-
siderable time

  when they finally appeared bain-
bridge held by his side a shapeless pack-
when titans drive



age of considerable size had not
peters and calker walked so close be-
side him as he bent his way leisurely
toward the crowrd about the jam it
would probably have been noticed that
this package was made up of a dozen or
more sticks of giant powder fastened
securely together and depending from
a sling of stout manila rope

  the line of m ermen had turned and
were watching his approach with inter-
ested curiosity but joyce and his gang
could see nothing reaching the men
bob paused struck a match and care-
fully lighted the end of a protruding
fuse as it sputtered up he gave a
short sharp word of command the line
of men opened instantly to let him
through and a second later he stood not
a dozen paces from joyce deliberately
swinging the deadly package round and
round his head

  for a sccond there was a breathless
hush then the red-haired man leaped
forward 

  stop he roared you young
whelp if you-

  he broke off with a gurgling sound
and the color left his face with a final
swing bob loosened his hold on the
bundle which curved in a perfect arc
over the rear of the jam over the
jagged crest and dropped swiftly out
of sight amid the massive timbers up-
ended in confusion along the face and
close to the spot where protruded the
freshly driven sphes which had caused
all the trouble

  an instant later the whole throng of
men hustled frantically for cover

chapter x

the power illll ixd it all

ix less than sixty seconds-so close
 had been bobs calculations-came a
detonation which shook the earth mak-
ing several of the running men stagger
and lose their stride up spurted a
great mass of water carrying with it
massive logs leaping like agonized
things alive they fell back again fol-
lowed by a shower of debris mingled
with fine spray which the wind sifted

down on the heads of the ducking
dodging men

  from his place behind a stump bain-
bridge rose swiftly shielding his face
with one crooked arm from the rain of
chips and splinters and bits of bark and
stared eagerly toward the jam it took
but a moment to see that the spiles had
disappeared arid the boom was -shat-
tered moreover the key logs of the
jam were so loosened that the whole
drive was again on its way downstream
bob turned to peters with a gesture of
satisfaction

  shes off jack he said get a
wiggle on now and rush her along
the waters dropping every minute and
weve got a mean stretch to cover be-
fore we strike the penobscot ill go
back and hustle the rear along-

  he stopped abruptly and whirled
around as a voice shrill and trembling
with passion was raised behind him

  youll pay for that you meddlin
pup ill teach you to go blowin up
folks property an mighty near com-
mittin murder ill show you you cant
play tricks on john joyce an get away
with it that game might work with
some but it wont--

  things happened so swiftly after that
that even the men standing around were
quite unable to understand exactly
what wras doing and which of the two
was really the one who started the trou-
ble

  the instant bob turned he saw that
joyce was either beside himself with
rage or giving a most astonishingly
good imitation of that condition his
face was purple with veins standing out
on his forehead like cords his eyes
glared with that combination of rage
and hate which a badly frightened man
almost invariably feels for the cause of
his mental disturbance the automatic
was leveled in his hand and one finger
trembled on the trigger

  for a single instant bainbridge stood
rigid every muscle suddenly tensing
perhaps he read a hint of joyces pur-
pose in the fellows eye perhaps it was
simply intuition which made him guess
what was coming at all events sud-
denly and without  warning he


top-notch magazine

launched his lithe body through the air
exactly as in the manner of the old for-
bidden flying tackle

  his shoulder struck joyces knees
and the wicked snapping shot of the re-
volver rang out at precisely the same
moment there was a yell of fury fol-
lowed by a crash then almost oppres-
sive silence

  bob was on his feet like a cat fin-
gers gripping the automatic he had
snatched from the owners nerveless
hand his jaw was hard and there
was a glint of more than anger in the
eyes he bent upon joyces supporters
hurrying up to the aid of their chief

  hands up he cried out harshly
quick

  he did not have to speak twice
there was something in his voice cou-
pled with an emphatic gesture with the
automatic which made those six men
big and powerful as they were obey
him with remarkable unanimity

  take their guns jack continued
bainbridge in that same commanding
voice

  peters stepped forward to obey the
first man drew back instinctively and
started to pull down the hand which
held a revolver without an instants
hesitation bob fired the bullet struck
the upraised weapon on its blued-steel
barrel wringing a cry of surprise and
pain from the fellows lips as he
dropped the gun

  there was no more trouble after that
peters collected four revolvers and two
remingtons then he glanced ques-
tioningly at bainbridge

  throw em in the river the latter
commander curtly  way out in the
middle where they cant be recovered
the riverman walked a few steps to-
ward the bank then pausing he
glanced back at the straight young fig-
ure standing behind him

  theyre mighty good guns he said
hesitatingly seems a shame to throw
em away like this

bainbridge returned briefly im
simply pulling the stings of this gang
he watched his man fling the weap-
ons one after another into the stream

and then sending the automatic splash-
ing after the others he turned suddenly
back to the six humiliated individuals
before him

  go he commanded with a mo-
mentary flare of passion beat it and
dont let me set eyes on you again-
understand  i wont be so easy on you
the next time here take that scum
with you hes only stunned

  he waited staring from under low-
ered lids until the gang had disap-
peared in the bushes half dragging half
carrying their stunned leader with them
then with a long sigh he turned slowly
and smiled at peters

  all right jack he said quietly i
dont think well have any more trou-
ble here just hustle all you can to
make up for this delay

  peters grinned and snapped out some
orders to the men which sent them fly-
ing along the bank and even out on the
stream over the tumbling logs but as
they went they cast glances of open un-
adulterated admiration at the young
man coolly brushing a bit ol mud from
one shoulder and their comments to
each other left no trace of doubt of
their thorough approval of everything
he had said and done

  bob heard some of them and when
the men had gone on he smiled a bit
to get that drive down successfully he
knew he must have the men with him
he knew also that deliberate planning
could not have accomplished that result
half so well as this encounter with the
tools of the lumber trust the whole
affair had proved a great piece of luck
for him thought the young lumberman
his meditation was broken in upon by
the sound of a strange voice

  i had no idea lumbering was such a
strenuous occupation

  a moment later bainbridge was look-
ing into a pair of pleasant friendly eyes
set in the handsome face of a man of
about fifty he was roughly dressed in
well-worn but finely made fishing
clothes and carried a good trout rod in
one hand there was too about the
stranger an air of forceful capability
which attracted the younger man

  its not usually quite so full of inci-
when titans drive



dent said bob but i dont believe
youd ever find it exactly tame

  the stranger smiled and made a
comprehensive gesture with his hands
and this is your idea of incident he
murmured whimsically i should call
it something decidedly stronger

  he hesitated for an instant then
moved closer to bob

  youre going downstream arent
you  do you mind if i walk along with
you  my camps down that way
bainbridge acquiesced readily there
wras something very taking about the
stranger and within ten minutes he
found himself chatting as if to an old
friend his companion turned out to
be wolcott sears of boston on a two
weeks trip in the maine woods the
name was only vaguely familiar but
bob felt sure from his manner that he
was a man of affairs he was tremen-
dousty interested in hearing all about
the peculiar conditions of this particular
drive and before bainbridge realized it
he had given a brief narrative of his
fight with the lumber trust and the
events which had grown out of it

  you interest me extraordinarily mr
bainbridge the older man said in his
crisp decisive way when at last they
paused at the point several miles below
the scene of the last jam where sears
had to branch off to reach his camp
things of this sort always do for its
only those one has to struggle for which
are really worth while youve certain-
ly had to fight hard in this case but
youve practically won out havent
you after this last fracas i shouldnt
suppose thered be much chance for
further interference

  bob shrugged his shoulders and
smiled a little you sadly underesti-
mate the power of the trust mr sears
i shant be beyond the chance of inter-
ference until the drive is safe in our
mill booms at lancaster and even then
it wouldnt turprise me if theyd try to
work some dirty trick

  sears frowned indignantly then his
face brightened

  in spite of everything i think i
should bet on you he chuckled
theres a certain vigor in your method

of dealing with these people which
makes for success i really believe
youll win mr bainbridge and i surely
hope so it has been a great pleasure
to meet you and i trust one to be re-
peated i shall be hereabouts for some
time yet and may run across you be-
fore i leave

  bob warmly reciprocated his feeling
and after a hearty handshake turned
south along the river while sears dis-
appeared in the undergrowth to the
westward

  fine man commented the younger
man aloud hope i do run into him
again meanwhile however the rear
isnt coming along half quick enough
and i havent seen a darn thing all aft-
ernoon of the wangan  hope noth-
ings happened to it and the grub that
would be one awful blow

  it was one that was spared him
within half an hour the clumsy scow
hove in sight it tied up to the bank
a little later and before dark prepara-
tions for supper were going on merrily

  bob did not get in till later assured
that all was well with the cook and his
staff he went on downstream to see
how peters and his gang were pro-
gressing on his return he discovered
a stranger warming himself by the dry-
ing fire he looked like an old-time
woodsman and the instant bainbridge
appeared he was on his feet extracting
an envelope from the interior of his
hat

  from mr tweedy sir

  the young lumberman ripped it open
without a premonition of the blow in
store for him it was natural for
tweedy to write he would be report-
ing his success in the matter of credit
of course and probably gloating over
the amount of manufactured lumber he
had sold in so short a time bainbridge
noted that it had been written in the
bangor office the night before then
settling himself by the fire he proceeded
to read

  dear bobby  its all up with us boy
were done and we may as well admit it
first as last and make what terms we can
with the gang i cant get credt anywhere
cranes been ahead of me and spilled the
beans each time whats more gastich ab-

solutely refuses to renew that note says he
must have the cash for some stocks hes
carrying and all that but you know what
it means its due in less than a week and i
cant for the life of me see an earthly way of
scraping the money together last of all-
and worst of all-i havent been able to make
a single sale of lumber for the simple rea-
son that the trust has cut prices below cost
and has taken every customer from us if
i cut to meet them theyll go lower you
can see that theyve got the stock and the
resources cranes set out to ruin us at any
cost and hes succeeded it hurts like sin
to say it boy but theres nothing left to do
but give in and make the best terms we
can let me hear from you at once yours
ever	john tweedy

chapter xi

no quitter

tvhe letter dropped into bobs lap

	and for a long minute he sat star-
ing into the yellcw dancing flames his
face was blank and just a little white
for the blow had been a heavy one and
totally unexpected he could not seem
to understand it it was unbelievable
that he and tweedy who had been fair
and square in every one of their busi-
ness dealings could be forced to the
wall by such a monster of corruption as
elihu crane

  there must be some mistake tweedy
must have been thrown into one of his
unjustifiable panics that was it of
course

  bob picked up the letter to read it
carefully again

  he perused it to the last word and
then leaned back against the sapling his
face drawn and somber it really did
not sound like a mistake it was all
clear and logical and singularly cohe-
sive it was the sort of thing crane
would delight in planning and putting
into execution-the cutting of prices on
a competitor tweedy had written that
if they attempted to cut under the
trusts present rates there would be a
further reduction that was quite true
bob knew because he had had a vast
deal of experience with the trusts
method of doing business they would
ruin him no matter how great the cost
because he was dangerous to their con-
tinued well-being with bainbridge in
the ring and fighting vigorously against

the graft and wholesale theft of timber-
lands those juicy melon cuttings which
had been so pleasing to the stockholders
would cease-therefore bainbridge
must go

  presently bobs eyes fell again to the
letter and somehow that single sentence
seemed to stand out as if written in
capitals it hurts like sin to say it boy
but theres nothing left to do but give
in and make the best terms we can

  for a second bob stared the blood
rvishing into his face a crimson flood
make terms with crane go on his
knees to that scoundrel who had long
ago parted with the last shred of de-
cency and self-respect not much

  they must have resources enough to
meet that note at least the trust
could not keep the price of lumber down
indefinitely they must weather the
storm in some way and when this
drive was safe at the mills ready to be
cut into lumber they would have the
laugh on elihu crane

  oblivious to the men about him even
to the fact that the cook had some time
ago announced supper bainbridge be-
gan to search his mind for means of
staving off the evil day most of the
stocks and bonds constituting his pri-
vate fortune had been already pledged
as collateral for loans to the firm he
still had a few thousand dollars worth
of steel preferred which could be sold
and there was pinecrest the beautiful
and costly home on the outskirts of
bangor which had been left him by his
father it should not be difficult to
raise a mortgage of ten thousand at
least on the place

  the notes for ten thousand so
thats all straightened out bainbridge
murmured with a snap of his fingers
the money from the stock can go for
current expenses pll fix it up this
very night

  he did fortunately tweedy held
his power of attorney with the right to
sign checks and execute papers of any
sort so it was possible for him to put
through these deals without his re-
turning to bangor that another note
for nearly as much as the first fell due
in little more than a fortnight bain-
when titans drive



bridge knew quite well by that time
however he fully intended to have the
drive down as far as their mill at lan-
caster fifty miles or so above bangor
and it is always possible to raise money
on timber even in the rough

  of course if the trust continued their
campaign of cutting prices bobs plans
would be materially affected he could
not believe however that they would
do such a thing for any great length of
time a dollar meant as much to them
as to any one and even the pleasure of
ruining a competitor would scarcely
compensate for the loss of so much
money

  a long letter of instruction and ex-
planation was written to tweedy that
night and despatched the first thing in
the morning by the trusty hand of joe
moose the indian that off his mind
bob returned to his drive with renewed
vigor for the necessity for haste was
now even greater than before it was
a question of getting the logs down in
double-quick time or being dragged into
the bankruptcy court and that sort of
notoriety did not appeal in the least to
the young man 

  it was this feeling of necessity which
got bob up next morning before the
blackness of the night was more than
faintly tinged by streaks of pale gray
in the east he wanted to be off and
doing even necessary inaction chafed
it seemed an eternity before the men
had finished breakfast and were ready
for the days wrork as a matter of
fact they took less time than usual for
something of bainbridges intense
eagerness for speed seemed to have
made itself felt

  all morning bob worked like a tro-
jan getting the drive out into the
katahdin river he did not storm and
swear at his men as many bosses do
instead he had a way of jollying them
along in a manner which might sound
superficially like fun but which held
more than an undercurrent of serious-
ness he treated them as human be-
ings not as if they were slaves from
whom every last atom of work was to
be extracted and yet when the need
arose he could hand out a rebuke the

caustic sting of which was enough to
make a mans hair stand on end the
result was that the crew soon admired
him and when they found how urgent
was the need for haste they fell to with
a will and gave the best that was in
them

  bainbridge was not long in perceiving
their attitude and it gratified him in-
tensely he had never actually had
charge of a drive before he knew the
theory of course but that is very dif-
ferent from the practical operation and
the discovery that he could handle a
rough-and-ready crowd like this in a
manner so totally different from that
generally practiced by bosses of crews
gave him no small satisfaction

  by dint of constant labor at which
bob spared neither himself nor his men
the drive was successfully swung into
the slightly larger river by two oclock
there was no real respite even then
the stream was almost as difficult as
the megantic and constant watchful-
ness was necessary to prevent fresh
jams at a number of points conse-
quently the men snatched a hurried din-
ner in relays and hustled back to work
again

  it was about three and bob had just
left the spot where only the most
strenuous personal labor on the part of
himself and four river jacks had kept
the drive from jamming he was hot
and sweaty and generally weary as he
continued his way downstream and his
wrath was naturally instant when on
suddenly rounding a bend he came
upon curly kollock cool calm and un-
ruffled sitting comfortably on a rock
enjoying a cigarette

  as the latter saw bainbridge he
flushed slightly and half rose from the
bowlder then with a stubborn twist
of his lips he sank back again pulling
hard on the cigarette and doing his best
to look unconcerned

  bob walked straight up to him and
stopped

  well he said bitingly im sorry
youve lost the use of your feet and
hands is it paralysis

  kollocks flush deepened and he
mumbled something inane about taking

a smoke he found that he had arisen
apparently without volition and was
standing before the other man who
stared at him a long half minute

  this is no rest cure said bob at
length youre paid for helping the
drive along i dont want any loafers in
this gang understand now get
down to the headof the drive-and do
something

  kollocks face was flaming and his
eyes gleamed angrily i dont take
that line of talk from anybody he
growled clenching his fists threatening-
ly ill-

  youll do what i said and do it
quick bainbridges voice was not
raised above a conversational pitch but
there was a ring in it which seemed to
take the fight and bluster out of the big
riverman with the effectiveness of a
keen knife thrust into an inflated blad-
der for a second he stood in awkward
silence swallowing hard in his embar-
rassment then he raised his head
again

  i dont need your jobt he said in a
poor imitation of devil-may-care defi-
ance ill get my time and-

  bainbridge cut him short youll
get down to the drive and work beat
it now-quick 

  without another protesting word
kollock turned meekly and obeyed

chapter xii

 the test

defore he had taken a dozen steps
kollock was furious with himself
and by the time bainbridge was out of
sight the wrath of the riverman had
risen to a white heat

  from the first he had tried to dislike
bainbridge pete schaeffer had been
his friend and after he had been
whipped curly made up his mind that
there could be no getting along in a
crew bossed by the victor then came
that brief but pointed interview with
bob which affected him so oddly he
had never before had anybody tell him
that he was to be trusted most bosses
had been emphatic in saying the oppo-
site thing or if they kept silent they

showed in a dozen obvious ways that
they considered him in the same class
with his notorious brother

  then there was the incident of the
day before curly could not help ad-
miring the manner in which bainbridge
had handled the crowd that was trying
to hold up the drive it was exactly the
sort of thing he would like to have done
himself and his heart warmed toward
the man with the courage and ability to
act in that fashion moreover jack
joyce was an old enemy of his and the
sight of the fellows humiliation had
inclined the riverman even more strong-
ly toward the man who had brought it
about

  but that was over now lie told him-
self furiously as he stamped along the
stream hands clenched and face set in
a black scowl he hated bainbridge
the man had no right to jump on him
that way how did he know what had
been the cause of kolloeks behavior
he had asked no questions given curly
no chance to explain even had the lat-
ter been inclined to lower himself to
that extent fie had taken it for
granted that the river jack was loafing
in spite of the fact that his record as a
worker was equal to that of the best

  this was where the sting lay kol-
lock was aggrieved and disgruntled be-
cause of what was to him a very good
reason there had been a definite ob-
ject in his pause by that stone the
night before he had received a brief
note from bill in which he was urged
to make use of any chance you git to
do-you know what

  curly did know what very well it
meant that he was to thwart and delay
the progress of the drive by any means
in his power any means the sim-
plest of course was to cause something
to happen to bainbridge himself bill
had not hesitated to suggest several
ways by which this happy end could be
reached none of them appealed par-
ticularly to curly he was not over-
scrupulous but he disliked doing up a
man in cold blood without giving him
even a ghost of a show still bill had
done him good turns more than once
when he was out of work and last but
when titans drive



not least there was the financial side of
the affair curly had never been told
who or what was back of these attacks
on the independent lumber company
but he knew there was plenty of money
in it

  all this he had been thinking over as
he sat smoking that cigarette in the
end he decided to have nothing to do
with it bainbridge had trusted him
and played square for that reason he
would be equally square and above-
board and let this dirty work alone

  that was what he had decided but
now-

  he gritted his teeth glared fiercely
around and came to an abrupt stop
every instinct of the riverman was
aroused on his left the river dropped
over short falls into a narrow gorge
it was a spot where things were likely
to happen at any time and where a
man or two should have been stationed
continually curly knew in fact that
there had been men here all morning
they had been called away for some
purpose leaving the little falls un-
guarded and as he stood there his
practiced eyes told him that he was be-
holding the very start of a jam

  a log plunging over the falls up-
ended another was thrust under it
a third and fourth coming down to-
gether caught on the obstruction all
being held by some stones rising mid-
stream before the current could tear
them loose several more timbers were
forced against the mass which was pil-
ing up so swiftly bridging to the oppo-
site shore

  to carry out that angry resolve of a
minute or two ago curly should have
rolled himself another cigarette and
watched the growing damage with a
sardonic smile he did nothing of the
sort for a flash he had forgotten his
grievance and was a river hog pure
and simple the stoppage must be
broken before it reached the propor-
tions of a real jam there was no one
else to do it and so he leaped to the
task without a seconds pause for
thought

  upstream he ran a few feet his eyes
fixed on the surface of the river above

the falls then he saw what he wanted
an instant later using his peavey much
as a pole vaulter does his pole he
leaped straight out over the water
landed squarely on a big log and was
carried down to the falls-and over
them

  he took the drop easily riding the
log with that perfect balance which is
second nature to the seasoned riverman
when the timber bumped against the
rapidly forming jam curly leaped
again thrusting the log down as he did
so and landed on the solid barrier
scrambling lightly over to the face of
this he thrust deftly with his peavey
into the mass and began to work des-
perately to loosen the key log--that first
upended stick of pine which had
started the whole trouble and which
must be started before the rest of the
barrier would give

  he got a good hold on it but the
thing defied his efforts to tear it loose
it was wedged too tightly for even his
great strength and though he seemed
to feel it move slightly he strained his
muscles to the utmost in vain to accom-
plish anything further presently he
realized with a thrill that the jam was
piling up behind him faster and faster
he ceased his efforts and clamping the
peavey on timber above the key log
pried it free and sent it bobbing down-
stream another foilowed and another
still sweat poured in streams from
him trickling blindingly into his eyes
but he did not stop to wipe it away
there was no time he must go on do-
ing his best till help came or else-

  a faint jar shook the jam a second
later curly felt a hand lightly touch his
shoulder a familiar voice sounded in
his ear

  good work son wheres that trou-
ble maker oh i see let me drop
down to that ledge where i can get a
good hold thats the idea now grip
her above me fine ready now 
yank away

  it was bainbridge-swift agile in-
credibly fresh considering what he had
accomplished that day for a moment
or two curly did not realize that this
was the man he hated he simply felt


top-notch magazine

an overwhelming thankfulness that
some one had come at last and obeyed
orders mechanically and without ques-
tion

  but as his peavey gripped the end of
that troublesome log there suddenly
flamed into curlys mind-temptation
bainbridge stood below him perched
perilously on the very face of the jam
a little thrust-the tiniest movement of
the rivermans arm-would send him
plunging into the stream while another
movement would suffice to drop one of
the looser logs upon him there were
no witnesses the whole affair would
pass as an unfortunate accident a
chance like this so easy so absolutely
safe would never come again

  now broke in the crisp voice of
the lumberman hard over boy to-
ward me-all you know how 

  curlys muscles strained as he threw
every ounce of strength into the pull
the key log creaked and groaned as if
in agony but was thrust gradually for-
ward curly felt it moving faster and
faster and instinctively he prepared for
that backward leap which would carry
him out of reach of the treacherous
avalanche of falling logs

  a second later his peavey was torn
from his hands by the sudden collapse
of half the face of the jam the logs at
his side vanished in the unexpected
rush but that on which he stood re-
mained firm for a precious moment
below him he saw bainbridge whirl like
a cat and grasp for something solid
instantly he bent over reaching out
both callous muscular hands and as
swiftly bob gripped them there was
a heave an upward scramble another
crash as the remainder of the jam dis-
appeared into the foaming water but
the two men had leaped in time and a
moment later they were standing to-
gether on the bank

 thank you-curly bainbridge
said in a level voice that was touch-
and-go for a minute

  that was all but somehow curly
knew that what he had done was un-
derstood and appreciated in the stress
of the peril which the two had shared
shoulder to shoulder like common

brother river hogs kollocks anger and
hate had vanished utterly he no
longer desired revenge his attitude of
a scant half hour before seemed small
and mean and petty he had saved the
life of he man his brother wanted out
of the way and given the opportunity
he would do it as promptly again

chapter xiii

the limit

purly kollocks interest and
liking for his boss grew stronger
day after day there was something
about bob bainbridge which stirred
the finer qualities in his nature and
brought twinges of shame to the young
riverman whenever he thought how
near he had come to throwing his lot
with his brother if bill ever showed
up he resolved to tell him just what he
thought of him too but in the mean-
time not being much of a penman he
made no effort to answer the letter it
was sufficient that he considered himself
cut loose ffom the whole miserable
bunch if they were expecting aid from
him intheir plotting they were doomed
to disappointment

  more and inore often as they de-
scended the katahdin river the boy
was stirred to anger at the constant suc-
cession of moves made by that gang
of crooks against the man who fought
them practically alone and single-
handed

  along the river were several dams
placed for the purpose of regulating the
head of water and facilitating the proc-
ess of driving they belonged to the
trust but their owners were bound at
all times to allow a normal head of
water when it was called for instead
of doing this now thev played all sorts
of tricks on bainbridge when he
particularly needed plenty of water to
float his drive past a shallow or narrow
spot the gates were arbitrarily shut
down and the drive hung up again
at one point where the middle part of
the drive had jammed and the crew
were occupied in picking it instead of
using dynamite the gates which bob
had personally closed were raised with-
when titans drive



out warning letting down a flood of
water which struck the jam with ter-
rific force it gave instantly carrying
three men with it two managed to es-
cape by a miracle and were dragged
ashore with broken limbs the other
was crushed and drowned

  after that bainbridge placed guards
at the various dams with instructions
to shoot any one who attempted to in-
terfere with them this resulted in a
terrific outcry on the part of cranes
underlings an appeal to the law in-
junctions and all that sort of thing
to which bainbridge paid no attention
whatever he went on his way calm-
ly knowing well that they could not
stop him in this manner and willing to
put up with the inconvenience that
would follow when it was all over and
he had returned to civilization

  mr wolcott sears continued his fish-
ing trip along the route the lumbermen
were following and began frequently
to appear in camp for an evening pipe
with bainbridge one evening they had
a private conference which lasted until
the small hours and the boston capi-
talist finally departed leaving bain-
bridge apparently much gratified

  the crew was with bob to a man
by this time they had gathered an ink-
ling of the plot against the firm and
of the stakes involved men had
strayed into camp telling of the extraor-
dinary reductions made by the trust in
the price of manufactured lumber
large sales had resulted to various
parties report said thus preventing
bainbridge  tweedy as well as sev-
eral other small independents from dis-
posing of a single plank

  the lumberjacks were not slow in
putting two and two together they
remembered rumors current in the big
woods for many months of the fight
which had started between the trust and
this man who was their boss it was a
fight to the finish people said in which
one side or the other must go under
from all appearances it looked to these
earnest simple-minded woodsmen as if
bainbridge would be vanquished unless
he could get that drive safely into the
mill booms and to that end they

strained every nerve they toiled from
dawn to dark staggering into camp
each night so utterly weary that they
sometimes fell asleep with their supper
half eaten before them only to be up
before daybreak to do it all over again

  it was a period of stress and strain
but it ended at last when the drive was
ushered into the penobscot to be seized
by the strong current and urged on to-
ward the mills at lancaster that goal
which had seemed a little while ago so
unattainable yet which was now so
near

  that very afternoon was perpetrated
the crowning outrage bainbridge was
shot at from the bushes-shot at delib-
erately with an intent to kill which was
defeated only by the miracle of chance
which made him bend over to tighten a
shoe lace at the precise moment of fir-
ing

  wild with fury the men who were
present dashed in pursuit of the would-
be assassins but to no purpose they
were in the land of civilization now
where there were motor cars by the
time the crowd of rivermen had surged
up the bank and plunged through the
undergrowth the rascally tools of the
trust were well away leaving their pur-
suers to rage impotently that there was
not a gun in the party with which the
tires could be punctured and the car
stopped

  the most angry of them all was
curly kollock he had double cause
for wrath having received that morn-
ing a letter from the very town of lan-
caster toward which they were striving
so hard to push the drive brief it was
and to the point he had played the
traitor bill wrote scathingly there
was only one wr by which he could rid
himself of the stigma and return to the
good graces of the gang he must
come at once to a certain house on the
outskirts of the town prepared to place
himself absolutely in his brothers
hands

 when the younger kollock read
those lines he swore roundly that
even bill should dare- write in such a
manner made him rage he was no
mans slave and there were bounds be-


top-notch maqazine

yond which even a brother could step
he was on the point of asking for time
off to come to a definite final settle-
ment with the crowd when the at-
tempted shooting occurred at first
this cowardly deed only added to his
rage but swiftly in its wake came un-
wonted gravity

  disagreeable even serious as all
those other persecutions had been not
one of them held the weight of this last
culminating effort to put bob bain-
bridge out of the running that bill
was mixed up in it curly had no doubt
and the realization frightened him he
had always looked up to his older
brother with admiration and a little
awe and he could not bear now to think
of him mixed up in anything so con-
temptible there was the danger in-
volved too and altogether the young-
ster felt as if he must see bill at once
and try to make him cut the gang and
get away his efforts might have no
effect but there was at least a chance

  that night-or rather early in the
morning- while it was still pitch black-
he slipped quietly out of camp without
a word to any one he reached lan-
caster at four in the afterrioon having
made most of the journey in a scow
doing about six miles an hour going
at once to the address given in the let-
ter he found that his brother had gone
out not fifteen minutes before

  mebbe if you step in an wait hell
be back soon suggested the slatternly
woman who kept the house

  curly was shown to a room on the
second floor back where he recognized
a number of bills belongings scattered
about in the usual disorder perhaps
it was the sight of them which aroused
in the young fellow an jncreasing doubt
of his ability to do what he came for
would this man who had never been
in the habit of taking any ones advice
listen to him he wondered and then
unable to remain still arose and paced
the floor anxiously

  presently he dropped in a chair be-
fore a rough deal table on top of which
was tacked a large sheet of blotting pa-
per a corner of white paper pro-
truded from beneath it but curly

scarcely noticed this save as something
to pluck at nervously with thumb and
forefinger finally he lighted the lamp
walked back and forth some more then
relapsed into the chair again resuming
his absent plucking of the paper be-
neath the blotter

  ultimately of course he drew it
gradually forth and catching a word
or two of writing he did not hesitate to
read the entire page

  it was a portion of a letter lacking
both superscription and first page
neither was it signed but there was
enough in those few lines to make the
riverman leap to his feet with a startled
cry of dismay

  great guns he gasped burn the
mill-our mill well i guess not

  he carried the paper over to the light
thinking that he might have made a
mistake but it was plain enough

  having received orders from me by wire
in the manner above specified you will at
once fire the mill in the manner discussed
by us and decided upon by me at our last
meeting there must be no delay in your
action neither should you take a single
step before i order this is of the greatest
possible importance kindly advise me at
once that you thoroughly understand these
instructions

 for a minute or two curly stood
staring at this extraordinary fragment
then his gray eyes gleamed

  gee he muttered i sure wish i
could find the rest o this letter it
sounds like it might be from that -old
skunk crane that bills so thick with
but o course you never kin tell it
would certain be worth somethin to
know for sure

  without hesitation he yanked up the
blotter tacks and all there was noth-
ing underneath so he next jerked forth
the single drawer of the table and
dumped out its contents a search
through these revealed nothing of in-
terest and he was about to replace the
drawer when it occurred to him to
thrust an inquiring hand into the space
back of it his fingers encountered pa-
per and a moment later his eyes
gleamed with satisfaction as they rested
on two envelopes addressed to his
brother in that same erect black writing
when titans drive



which had characterized the single
sheet

  got you this time i reckon he
muttered in a tone of intense satisfac-
tion if bainbridge aint interested in
this-

  he paused abruptly and raised his
nead with a jerk his eyes narrowing
and his grip tightening unconsciously
on the letters from outside came a
queer vibrating clang for an instant
he listened tensely as the sound rose
and fell on the night air muffled a lit-
tle by closed doors and windows but
still clear and unmistakable-the primi-
tive village fire alarm with a gasp of
dismay he leaped toward the door

  cripes he cried gripping the knob
its to-night-to-night an i never
guessed

fire and smoke

purly found himself hatless and
 with two letters and a scrap of pa-
per clasped in one hand running swift-
ly toward that portion of the river
bank where stood the bainbridge mill
what he could accomplish alone and
unaided was a question which troubled
him vaguely he meant at least to
give the best that was in him toward
fighting a calamity he might have pre-
vented if only he had kept his wits
about him

  presently he slackened his pace a lit-
tle and a puzzled wrinkle came into his
forehead there was not the slightest
glare to be seen in the direction of the
mill it seemed odd that a fire in such
a place should not show itself sooner
he hurried on a little farther but still
there was no sign of fire-no noise or
scurrying of people at length reach-
ing the fence which surrounded mill
and lumber yards he paused wonder-
ing in which direction lay the nearest
gate a second later half turning he
saw the glow and sparks from a burn-
ing building rising above the leafless
trees at least a mile away

  gee he muttered in a tone of re-
lief im sure glad i was fooled for

a bit i thought it was all up but now
mebbe i kin put a crimp in their game

  he stood silent for a minute or two
turning the matter over in his mind
there were difficulties which had not
occurred to him at first if he went
to bainbridge or to the authorities with
his discovery bill would be sure to pay
the penalty he was not anxious for
this he did not want to mix his
brother up in the affair if it were pos-
sible to keep his name out of it if he
could only see bill he felt sure he could
make him cut it all and get out of the
country but that was the trouble-to
find him and do it quickly where had
he gone this night of all others what
was keeping him away so long was
it possible after all that the burning
had been planned for to-night but
planned to take place later 

  the interior of the inclosure seemed
very quiet and peaceful yet curly felt
a fresh stab of apprehension when pres-
ently he discovered the big gate un-
locked and ajar after a momentary
hesitation he pushed the gate still far-
ther open and slipping through closed
it behind him and crept ghostlike
along in the shadow of the fence

  ahead loomed the mill buildings vel-
vet-black shadows against a blue-black
sky to his left lay great stacks of
manufactured lumber worth many
thousand dollars he could not see
them now but he knew their location
and the thought of all that property
going up in smoke made him scowl
fiercely and clench his fists in the dark-
ness

  presently he stopped abruptly as the
blackness was pierced by a single gleam
of light from the corner of the shadowy
building the next instant he gave a
relieved chuckle it came from the
watchmans shanty of course that
was where it stood close by the corner
of the main building

  everything was so quiet and peaceful
that it seemed futile to go any farther
yet somehow the man wanted to make
sure finally he decided to gain this
end by giving the watchman a tip about
the gate

  crossing the open space he stepped

magazine

to the window and peered through the
dingy glass the shack seemed empty
the lighted lantern stood on a rough
table from which a straight deal chair
was pushed back yet in spite of this
curly could not be quite certain so he
reached for the latch and thrust the
door open

  it was not empty some one-some-
thing was there a huddled mass lying
face down in the corner with a quick
gasp of horror and alarm curly
straightened and whirled round

  too late something heavy struck
his head and pitched him dazed against
the wall of the shanty he threw out
both hands toward the shadows he
could barely see and from his lips came
a hoarse cry of mingled pain and fury
a second blow beat through his guard
and stretched him senseless on the
ground

  the coming around seemed to curly
merely a matter of seconds really it
must have been much longer when he
recovered enough of his senses to make
mental notes he discovered that he was
lying flat on the sawdust-covered floor
near a big circular saw that gleamed
like burnished silver he was bound
round and round with ropes unable to
move hand or foot a lighted lantern
made a bright spot in the intense gloom
dimly revealing above him the heavy
beams and rafters of the mill after a
little he saw sitting on the other side
of the lantern a man wtho gazed stead-
ily at him and whose face even in the
shadows seemed familiar a moment
later he realized that the man was john
joyce

  the discovery was not a pleasant one
toyce and he had been enemies for a
considerable time owing mainly to the
fact that both were paying attentions
to a certain young woman wrho showed
decided partiality for kollock in a
moment of passion joyce had sworn
lo get curly and the latter had
jeered at him he did not jeer now
the best he could do was to summon
a forced smile

  youll grin out o the other side of
your mouth afore i git done with you
you spy in scum observed the red-

haired individual acrimoniously what
are you doin here 

  none o your business retorted
kollock promptly wheres bill 
better keep a civil tongue in your
head snarled joyce how come you
sneakin around this mill to-night
who put you wise to whats goin on
possessed of only a small fund of
diplomacy curly saw a chance to make
his enemy writhe and at once took it
regardless of all other considerations

  never you mind who put me wise
he retorted im on all right i know
youre goin to set fire to the mill to-
night an whats more i know who
put you up to it-see  git that through
your dome ive got evidence stowed
away-in a safe place too-thatll send
somebody to thomaston prison for a
nice little bit get me

  all of this was not strictly true but
the young riverman could not pass up
the chance to make joyce shiver a
moment later he more than regretted
the impulse

  little johnny-on-the-spot aint
you snarled the red-headed man
when he had partially recovered from
the shock you made a nice bull
though exposin your cards before the
show-down

  his jaws came together with a snap
and rising suddenly to his feet he
dropped on one knee beside curly in
another second he had thrust a lump of
waste between the helpless rivermans
jaws and tied it down with a dirty strip
of cloth then he resumed his seat

  jest a little precaution against
noise he said unpleasantly my pals
are out in the yard an i aint anxious
for em to know i brung you in here
they think youre a second watchman
-see i got sight o your face first
an covered it up so nobody would know
you was here bills down to lynch-
burg soused an likely wont show up
till mornin this was to be the night
for our little shindy only not havin
no word yet i was goin to give it up
-till you come along now i think
ill let things go ahead word or no
word get me steve 
when titans drive

  he arose leering hideously and
curly felt the perspiration begin to
burst out all over his body his wide-
open eyes-the only part of him which
could move-sought jorces but the
fellows gaze shifting continually
thwarted the attempt kollock noticed
-just why he did not know-that the
others face was deathly pale and that
his low forehead was covered with lit-
tle beads of sweat a second later joyce
picked up the lantern and moved lightly
toward the door

  jest tell em that you saw me an
give em my regards he sneered over
his shoulder but his voice cracked on
the last word and stumbling over a
loose board ih the floor he disappeared

  for perhaps half a minute curly lay
absolutely still then the horror of
what that human fiend meant to do
struck him with full force turning him
cold and then hot as fire he rolled
over on his face and bracing both feet
against the foundation of the saw
strained the splendid muscles of back
and arm and shoulder as he had never
strained them before the ropes cracked
a little but held fast biting deep into
his flesh he paid no heed to the pain
again he strove with all his might to
break those bonds again he failed
jorce had done his work well

  he was still straining twisting and
flinging himself about till every inch of
his body seemed sore to the touch when
of a sudden the faint light tang of
something new in the air made him
stop like a person paralyzed

  smoke

  for a second he did not dare to
breathe slowly fearfully he drew in
the air then a smothered inarticulate
sound half scream half groan echoed
through the dark mill it zuas smoke
the coward had kept his word and fired
the building no one would ever know
the flames were coming fast-fast
presently they would reach him-

  in a panic of horror he again cast
himself here and there over the board
floor the sawdust sometimes muffling
the thudding sound of his body there
was not one chance in a thousand that
any one would hear him he stopped

csa

and listened but detected no sound a
fresh puff of smoke made him gag it
was coming faster and faster thicker
and thicker

  gasping for breath he flung himself
about again in a mad paroxysm of fear
above the thudding noise of his own
making he could hear the horrible omi-
nous crackling of flames crevices here
and there began to be outlined in dull
glowing changing red he thought he
heard the clanging of the primitive
alarm but he could not be sure

  hither and thither he rolled keeping
up the motion without conscious voli-
tion scraping scratching bumping
against obstacles but always striving
blindly to get farther away from the
consuming element beyond the parti-
tion

  at one time the lapping gurgling
sound of water struck on his dazed
senses with the shock of the incredible
tlien he realized that it came from be-
neath him and knew that he must be
in the portion of the mill built out over
the river a few inches of flooring
was all that separated him from the
cool soothing touch of that water the
bitter irony of it ate into his soul like
caustic and brought a sudden rush of
scalding tears to the stinging smoke-
blinded eyes

  the glow brightened grew more
vivid a single tongue of flame slid
through a crack and began licking up
the wall the sight seemed to arouse
curly to fresh exertions he flung him-
self furiously to one side and by a
strange chance he struck glancingly
against the teeth of the circular saw
which cut his face cruelly and tore away
the gag

  it took him a second or two to realize
what had happened then from be-
tween his swollen lips a fierce wild cry
of desperate appeal rang out it rose
shrilly piercingly ended in a choke he
tried to cry again but the smoke rushed
into his lungs and turned the shout into
a gruesome groan

  that smoke was pouring into the
room in clouds now the single tongue
of flame had bred a score casting a
lurid light over the place and driving

black despair into the half-conscious
brain of the hopeless victim

the way out

dob bainbridge came- down to
lancaster that same evening he
had made arrangements with tweedy to
be there at a certain hour to receive the
wire his partner planned to send regard-
ing a loan necessary to cover that sec-
ond note

  arriving in town about a quarter to
six bob went straight to the telegraph
office the operator a dapper youth of
almost tender years prqinptly handed
him an envelope

  came in just in time mr bain-
bridge he announced we close at
six you know

  bob nodded absently without speak-
ing and departed at once for the hotel
he usually patronized there would be
plenty of time in the morning to send
his partner an answer and he was anx-
ious to have a chance to think the mat-
ter over quietly

  reaching the hotel he registered and
went at once to the room assigned him
here he opened the message anti read
it through with a perfectly blank ex-
pression 

  have cover removed on tank house cant
use other timber

  well ill be hanged bainbridge
exclaimed aloud what the deuce
does that mean  have cover removed
on tank house cant use other timber
blamed if i think it means an tiling
sounds like gibberish to me 

  puzzled and decidedly ill-tempered
he sat down and scanned the message
closely he could not believe it had
been sent him as a joke tweedy was
not the sort to perpetrate that kind of a
pleasantry especially at present but
what else could it be

  for twenty minutes or more he sat
staring at the sheet before he made a
curious discovery the telegram was
not addressed to him at all but to one
william icollock

  the genial bill he muttered his

magazine

eyes sparkling with a new interest
jove  the plot thickens 

  a glance at the envelope showed his
own name written plainly thereon evi-
dently the boy had carelessly transposed
the messages giving bainbridge the one
intended for the tool of his bitterest
enemy to bob the annoyance of real-
izing that in all probability kollock
was in possession of tweedys wire
about the loan was swallowed up in the
interest of those ten words before him

  that they were written in a secret
code bainbridge had not a doubt
there was a superficial coherency about
them but when one studied the mes-
sage the impossibility of a careless op-
erator being responsible for those er-
rors became plain just what that code
might be bob did not know but he
meant to find out if such a thing were
possible a cryptogram addressed to
bill kollock must almost certainly be
of vital importance to himself

  the reading of the cipher-if such it
could be called-proved even simpler
than he had expected taking the first
letters of each word from left to right
made no sense at all reversing the
process however produced this cryptic
phrase

  touch torch

  about as dotty as the other grum-
bled bob crumpling the message into a
pocket im hanged if ill bother with
the tiling any longer

  he could not help thinking about it
however and after a futile walk to the
telegraph office and an equally futile
attempt to locate the operator he went
back to the hotel and turned in

  but even here his mind refused to
respond to the urgings of his tired body
though he did his best to forget those
two tantalizing words he found it im-
possible what did they mean what
could they mean perhaps after all
they meant nothing in themselves but
were simply a cryptic sort of signal
which the recipient alone would under-
stand

  touch torch he murmured drows-
ily as he stretched his weary body lux-
uriously on the first real bed he had
known in months what the deuce
when titans drive



touch torch- great guns the

mill

  with a single bound he cleared the
space between bed and bureau in a
second the lamp was lighted and he was
flinging on his clothes in mad haste
what a thick-headed fool he had been
that was it of course thwarted in
those other cowardly attacks it was the
most natural thing in the world for
elihu crane to make use of this means
of crippling his competitor he who
had not hesitated at attempted assas-
sination vas not likely to stop at arson

  within five minutes bainbridge had
left the hotel and was tearing down
the road in the direction of his property
the sky was still dark and placid and
for a little while he thought he would
be in time but as he reached the fence
surrounding the mill and ran along it
toward the nearest gates a sudden red-
dish glow flashed up through the black-
ness beyond the high board structure
followed by a little shower of sparks
like a feathery rocket

  without pausing an instant in his
rush bainbridge drew his revolver and
fired twice in the air then he broke
the stillness with a cry of fire from his
powerful lungs-a cry which might al-
most have raised the dead

  the gates were wide open and as he
raced through into the inclosure he al-
most collided with a shadowy figure
bent over and running with long agile
strides the pistol was still in bobs
hand and without a moment of hesita-
tion he sent it crashing square in the
middle of the unknowns forehead
dropping the fellow like a log

  one good thing done anyhow
muttered bainbridge with a fierce kind
of satisfaction

  he hesitated an instant wondering
whether to pause and make the fellow
secure or hurry on toward the burn-
ing building prief as had been the
space since it first showed the fire was
beginning to break forth illumining the
sky and making the mill seem almost
like a flaming furnace within there
was little chance of accomplishing any
good there while it would be a pity if
one of the undoubted criminals escaped

  he had made up his mind and was
searching through his pockets for some-
thing to bind the fellow with when a
scream rang out so wild and full of
agonized appeal that it chilled his blood
it came from the burning building and
in an instant bob was running toward it
with all his might

  he raced around a corner peering
through windows as he ran the front
half of the building was one glare of
flaming crimson in which no human
being could live a minute the man-
it was the watchman of course-must
be in the rear

  he kept on around reaching another
window he smashed it with a piece of
edging caught up from the ground
letting out a volume of smoke with a
bound he was inside facing the glare
which came from the billowing mass of
fire

  tom he cried shielding his face
with one crooked arm tom where
are you 

  there was no answer crouching
low and holding his breath he hurried
toward a portion of the mill which over-
looked the river behind him the flames
closed in with chuckling crackles like
sentient things of murderous intent bent
on cutting off his retreat

  tom he cried again where
are-

  the words died in his throat
sprawled across the log carrier near
one of the huge circular saws was the
inert body of a man the fire had al-
most reached it but bainbridge plunged
forward without faltering through
heat that singed hair and eyebrows and
seemed to sear his lungs with the breath
of death he plunged stooping he
grasped the unconscious man by the
shoulders and dragged him across the
floor he could not retreat as he had
come he did not try he was making
for the opening to the runway or chute
over which logs were yanked up from
the river this was rather steep and
slippery and he was forced to change
his grip on the man an instant later
he gave a cry of amazement as he rec-
ognized the blackened bloody features
of his own riverman

  but there was not a second to lose in
speculation as to what curly was doing
here the glare of the burning build-
ing lit up the whole river and already
from the other side came cries of ar-
riving villagers he could see them
running doubtles many of them saw
him as he paused in the fire-lit arch of
the chute with the unconscious youth in
his arms

  its a swim for it he muttered
glancing at kollock not much of a
one but mighty cold reckon well be
on our way

  hoisting kollock over his shoulder
he stepped into the log-polished trough
for a fraction of a second he seemed
to stand motionless straight as a dart
a striking figure against that back-
ground of lurid crimson then still
remaining upright he shot downward
at an angle like a person sliding on ice
to plunge with a great splash into the
icy water

chapter xvi

the verge of ruin

otepping hastily from his car
 john tweedy hurried across the
sidewalk and entered the lobby of the
bangor house his plump face had an
oddly sunken pasty look the jowls
were pendulous and there were dark
rings under the eyes his whole man-
ner in fact was that of a man on the
verge of a nervous cqllapse holding
himself together by sheer determination
of will

  inside the door he paused a moment
staring almost furtively to right and
left as if the ruin he knew to be so
imminent was already a matter of pub-
lic knowledge and comment the fair-
ly well-filled lobby held a number of
familiar faces whose owners either did
not or would not see the stout man
tweedy made sure that the slight was
intentional and a nervous tremor quiv-
ered on his lips

  bah he muttered hastening on to-
ward the desk theyre beginning to
cut me after the fire last night they
think im out for more credit its the
beginning of the end

  to his supersensitive mind the very
desk clerk who had so often laughed
obsequiously at the lumber magnates
jokes and pocketed with effusive thanks
his expensive cigars delayed purposely
in attending him it was the subtle im-
pertinence of an inferior which seems
to cut so much more deeply than any
other kind and it stung tweedy into a
momentary flash of his old spirit

  griggs he snapped in a voice
which brought the clerk instantly for-
ward i have an appointment to meet
mr bainbridge here at twelve he
went on transfixing the young man
with an icy stare has he left any
word for me

  before the flushed embarrassed
youth could answer a hand dropped
lightly on tweedys shoulder and a
cheery familiar voice sounded in his
ear

  well john youre certainly on the
dot put it there old man  im mighty
glad to see you

  it was bob clean fresh and well
groomed his eyes sparkled the glow
of health was in his cheeks there was
an air of vigor and physical fitness
about him which made tweedy stare in
bewilderment wondering whether his
partner was made of iron

  tm certainly glad to see you bob-
by he echoed gripping the strong
brown fingers i dont know how you
can stand the pace though im about
all in sitting up most of the night try-
ing to figure out our losses from the in-
complete-

  just one second john interrupted
bainbridge and only then was his part-
ner aware of the pleasant-faced rather
distinguished-appearing gray-haired
man who stood just behind the young
lumberman i want you to meet mr
wolcott sears of boston hes been
up in the woods fishing and we got
acquainted up there

  tweedy acknowledged the introduc-
tion with the best grace he could sum-
mon in view of the fact that he was
burning to get bob by himself and find
out something of where the firm stood
he knew sears by reputation as an in-
fluential and powerful capitalist and it
when titans drive



was his policy always to be agreeable to
moneyed men but even that combined
with the boston mans undoubted charm
of manner did not prevent tweedy
from being a trifle austere he only
thawed completely when sears pres-
ently announced that he would have to
tear himself away at once or else miss
the boston train	

 i was afraid hed stick around for
hours tweed said as bob returned
from seeing sears to the door lets
go over here where theres less crowd
couldnt have a better man said
bob falling into step with his partner
hes one of the best ever john and
has been a good friend to me

  of course of course returned
tweedy with a nervous sort of pettish-
ness thats all very well but we
dont want anybody else around just
now tell me about the mill com-
plete loss i suppose 

  bainbridge nodded just about
saved a few hundred thousand feet of
pine stacked at the upper end of the
yard everything else went

  a facial muscle quivered as if the
confirmation of what tweedy had
feared yet hoped desperately against
had touched a raw nerve he dropped
down in one of the row of leather-cov-
ered chairs facing main street and
took out his handkerchief

  my country he groaned staring in
bewilderment at his companion i
dont see how you can take it all so easy
you know as well as i do that theres
not a cent of insurance on the stock
you must realize that lancaster was
the only mill we had capable of taking
care of a big drive

  bainbridge sat on the arm of the ad-
joining chair one leg lightly swinging
back and forth

  thats true enough he nodded
feeling for his cigarette case ive
always contended though that with
proper equipment the mill at colport
could turn out a third more cut lumber
than the lancaster mill

  tweedy groaned and cast up his
eyes what if it could  he demand-
ed how in creation are we going to

find out were broke-busted-
cleaned out even in the stress of his
emotion he remembered to lower his
voice cautiously weve hardly an
asset left except the drive weve no
credit one of our notes for eight
thousand dollars is due in less than
twenty-four hours--due to the very
scoundrel whos brought us where we
are and whose plotting wont stop
there

  at last he seemed to find a shaft ca-
pable of penetrating the armor of bobs
self-possession with a start the young
man dropped the match and stared fix-
edly at tweedy the fresh-lighted ciga-
rette dangling unheeded between the
fingers of his other hand

  crane he exclaimed sharply
you mean to say hes bought up that
note 

  precisely

  huh  bainbridge lifted the ciga-
rette and took a thoughtful puff or
two that must be why he sent the
message i found here a little while ago
said if i was quite ready to crawl hed
be in his office till two this afternoon
he hesitated a second longer and
then stood up with a sudden deter-
mined squaring of his wide shoulders

  how about it john he asked a
curious gleam in the dark eyes what
do you say to making a call on the
genial elihu 

  tweedy rose heavily i give up
he said with a deep sigh do as you
like son its all one to me only dont
for an instant expect any mercy from
elihu crane personally id rather
spare myself the humiliation of an in-
terview which can result in no possible

good but if youre keen on it-

  he finished with an eloquent gesture
of resignation which brought a sudden
softness into the young mans eyes

  by jove but youre a sport he ex-
claimed with a touch of his hand on
the others shoulder which was almost
a caress dont you care though old
man it wont take long and ill attend
to the talk all youll have to do will
be to furnish me with the moral sup-
port of your presence

the visit to eliiiu

pvdr so many years elihu crane had

	preserved his impassive demeanor
in public that he gradually ceased to let
down the bars at all even in his own
office-that inner sanctum which he had
made as difficult of access as the specie
vault of the bank of england-he re-
tained his pose at this particular mo-
ment even holding in his hand that slip
of paper which was the strongest thread
in the web he had been weaving so long
and patiently about his hated competi-
tors his face revealed nothing of the
fierce joy which filled his soul

  that paper was the note which fell
due upon the morrow bainbridge 
tweedy could not meet it he was cer-
tain their funds were exhausted
their credit gone barring a miracle
he held them in his power at last he
meant to exercise that power ruthlessly
and without mercy

  there was one little carping doubt in
his mind-though that too was hidden
behind the impenetrable mask was he
to be deprived after all of the keen
pleasure he had planned for himself-
the pleasure of being the one imparting
to young bainbridge by word of mouth
the exact status of his affairs and a
gloating account of what the future
held in store

  his letter had been placed in bain-
bridges hands hours before bob was
not obliged to come but crane had
written with a perfect knowledge of the
young mans nature coupled with all
the diabolical cunning he possessed it
would be strange if the combination did
not serve to goad the high-spirited
youngster into doing what his former
partner desired and yet the minute
hand of the clock was climbing swiftly
upward from half past one and there
had come no word

  frowning the least bit crane at
length stretched out a lean wrinkled
hand toward one of a row of pearl-
topped buttons set in the surface of the
flat mahogany desk almost as he did
so one of the telephones at his left tin-
kled lightly and he lifted it swiftly a

brief conversation took place which
smoothed miraculously the forehead of
the lumber trust official

  show them in at once banning he
finished

  setting down the instrument he
leaned back eyes fixed on the door with
a touch almost of pleasurable anticipa-
tion in them wrhen presently it swung
open to admit bob bainbridge followed
closely by tweedy cranes mouth
tightened cruelly and the sandy-fringed
lids drooped a trifle

  and so he said at length his lips
curling youve come to crawl

  bainbridge did not answer for a mo-
ment he was busy settling down in
the chair which had not been offered
him and in seeing that tweedy did the
same then he drew out a cigar case
and with elaborate courtesy extended
it to crane

  no he murmured as the latter de-
clined with a brief gesture given up
smoking here john

  when tweedy had accepted and his
own weed was lighted bainbridge
leaned comfortably back in his chair

  to crawl he repeated slowly
well i dont know about that a fel-
low never likes to crawl if theres an-
other way out of a difficulty

  cranes eyes glinted rest assured
there isnt he retorted crisply  youre
in a hole you havent a single resource

left your credits no good-

  oh i dont admit that put in bob
hastily

  whether you admit it or not its
true retorted crane a note of cold
calculating triumph creeping into his
voice you cant bluff me ive had
a man looking up your affairs for some
time and i know what pm talking
about tweedy here has been break-
ing his neck all last week trying to bor-
row enough to meet your note of eight
thousand which is due at noon to-mor-
row that note-he bent forward
and raised for an instant the oblong
sheet of paper from his desk-is here
if he expected signs of surprise or
consternation from bainbridge he was
disappointed bob simply crossed one
leg over the other and nodded
when titans drive



  so i understand he drawled

  there was a briefest sort of pause
during which his dark eyes held the
older mans in thrall suddenly he
arose

  you may as well hand it over now
he said coolly moving toward the desk

  in a twinkling crane had acted with
amazing agility he bent forward over
the desk a buzzer sounded a
drawer popped open a second later
he had snatched from it a revolver
which he leveled swiftly at bob last
of all doors at either end of the office
opened noiselessly to admit a pair of
stalwart attendants

  bainbridge pausing in the middle of
the floor surveyed these maneuvers
with interest and frank amusement

  very clever and effective he mur-
mured slowly exhaling a whiff of
smoke plainly no ones ever going to
catch you napping it happens though
that i had no idea of playing the hold-
up game i wished merely to hand you
a check for the amount of that note
and interest and cancel it would you
mind turning that barrel just a trifle to
one side accidents will happen you
know and your staff here seems quite
able to cope with the situation alone

  a single momentary flash of incredu-
lous anger rippled across cranes im-
passive countenance then the mask
fell again and lowering the revolver
he bent forward

  you certainly dont expect me to ac-
cept a personal check of yours for that
amount do you he inquired coldly

  not quite smiled bainbridge
knowing your skeptical nature i took
the trouble to have it certified

  he drew out his bill case and taking
from it a narrow slip of paper laid it
before crane a silence followed-
tense vibrating with something of the
sense of that bitter baffled fury which
was rending the older man as he stared
at the scrap of paper that was depriv-
ing him of his revenge it was the
equivalent of currency he could not
refuse to take it the amount was cor-
rect to the last cent the whole trans-
action was one in which even his cun-
ning could find no flaw

 but where had the money come
from  he could not believe that any
one in bangor had supplied it it was
impossible that his subordinates could
have been so deceived

  with swiftly growing fury crane
made a brief note of payment on the
back of the paper his hand trembled
by the time the signature was written
his lips were quivering-his face dark

  there  he rasped harshly thrusting
the note at bainbridge where you
got it i dont know but itll do you no
good your best mills a total loss
you havent sold a foot of lumber in
weeks and you wont for months to
come everybodys bought what they
want from tis at easy rates you may
think this is a mighty smart move but
ill get you in the end 

  i think not

  bobs voice had taken on a sudden
quality of hardness his face lost the
half-bantering expression of a moment
before and grew coldly stern it was
as if he had all at once weariedof the
little drama he had been staging and
was determined to ring down the cur-
tain without delay

  i think not he repeated curtly
who did you make those biggest sales
of cut-rate lumber to crane 

  there was an underlying significance
in his tone which made crane glance
sharply at him from under penthouse
brows and then dismiss the two silent
attendants with a gesture

  what business is that of yours he
demanded

  bainbridge laughed harshly trium-
phantly what business is it of mine
ill tell you

  he bent suddenly forward gripping
the edge of the desk with both hands
his face was slightly flushed his eyes
fixed intently on crane held in their
depths a gleam of singularly disconcert-
ing triumph

  ill tell you he said rapidly j g
brown of portland had two million
feet didnt he creighton of rock-
land bought half as much there was
cox of portsmouth-blanchard-
manning-lafitte you see i know


top-notch magazine

  there was a ring in his voice which
made tweedy begin to tingle and sit
forward suddenly erect in thrilling an-
ticipation of the bombshell he felt sure
was coining

  why dont you ask the questions
youre dying to  how  why 
youre wild to know i can see it in
your eyes bob laughed again and
crane winced at the sound ill tell
you i know because theyre only my
agents-buying-for-me 

  its a lie burst from cranes white
lips they paid cash you havent a
cent

  i have something better-unlimited
credit shall i tell you whos backing
me because he hates the trust and has
faith in my ability to fight you wol-
cott sears of boston now do you un-
derstand instead of ruining us by
cutting rates youve played straight
into our hands timber values cant go
down well sell at market prices what
we bought from you and clean up a
cool half million  the deal

  with an inarticulate cry of fury
crane leaped to his feet and stood glar-
ing at bainbridge with flaming mad-
dened eyes the mask of inscrutability
had vanished from his face one saw
the real man now stripped of the ve-
neer of temperament and civilization

  its a plot he raved shaking a
skinny fist in bobs face its a vile
conspiracy ill take the case to court

ill have you jailed for-

  sit down

  bainbridges tone was not loud but
there was a compelling quality about it
which stopped the boiling torrent of
fury with amazing suddenness crane
gulped hard caught his trembling lips

between his teeth-and finally subsided
into his chair

 you talk of plots-you the
young mans voice was hard cold full
of unutterable contempt do you hap-
pen to know the penalty for conspiracy
to commit arson-and worse 

  i-i dont know-what you mean
faltered crane avoiding the dark eyes
bent so keenly on his face

  oh yes you do look at these
with a swift dramatic motion bain-
bridge suddenly jerked from his pocket
some sheets of paper covered closely
with erect spitefully black writing and
held them before crane

  your own hand he accused in-
structions to your henchman bill kol-
lock i think the jury at your trial
will consider them proof enough
cranes jaw dropped his white face
had turned a sickly green

  you-wouldnt-dare he gasped
wouldnt i  just let me show you
without waiting a reply bob leaned
over and picking up one of the tele-
phones stood erect

  headquarters he said briefly
then after a momentary pause that
you chief this is bainbridge will
you send up those two plain-clothes
men we arranged about yes the ar-
rest can be made any time thats all
thank you

  the receiver clicked into place again
and bainbridge returned the instrument
to the desk crane sat hunched in his
chair his face a mixtrire of hate and
fear and baffled fury tweedy looked
as if a mammoth weight had been sud-
denly lifted from his shoulders bobs
expression was inscrutable

  the room was very still

the height of fashion

jpxcltse me maam said the fashionable ladys new cook but would ye
 moind now if i had this address printed on my card

jhen cheridah first found the
valentine picking it from the
jumbled mass of others on the
long counter she gave a quick
little sob and pressed it close
to her heart for all the world as if she
had come upon a diamond in the coal
bin she was alone behind the counter
at the time otherwise mr howland
the dignified floorwalker might have
objected seriously to such a demonstra-
tion on the part of a mere saleslady

  after the thrill of the discovery  was
past cheridahs shining eyes devoured
every detail of the gaudy multicolored
token

  its just the same she murmured
over and over again her voice tremu-
lous its just the same oh i won-
der-

  the valentine was a built-up affair
generously trimmed with paper lace
and resplendent with tinsel on each
corner were white flying doves with
outspreading wings carrying letters in
their bills in the center was a reproduc-
tion of a heavy door across which a
pink-and-white cupid perched on a
cloud held up entwined hearts arrow-
pierced lifting the door one wras
greeted with these words

   uf you lofe me
   as i lofe you-

    no knife cant cut
    our lofe in two pieces

                                aint it

  to cheridah these lines-their gro-
tesque humor so out of key with the
rest of the valentine-brought back re-
membrance of a day five years earlier
when hezekiah saunders bashful
freckled-faced sixteen had slipped this
valentines counterpart into her desk at
recess being fourteen cheridah haw-
kins had been both flattered and flus-
tered

  the five long years that intervened
between the time she had first glanced
upon this valentine at school and the
present when she gazed upon it-or at
least upon its replica-in the stuffy ar-
tificially lighted basement of the store
stupendous were years fruitful with
history dark unpleasant and bitter
history

  somehow cheridah had never re-
called the past so vividly as she did at
this moment standing there behind the
counter her fingers pressing the tawdry
trinket-beautiful in her eyes-against
her black shirt waist the hot tears
came suddenly and continued un-
checked slipping down her cheek her
lips quivered

  miss downs a voice lifted com-
mandingly shattering her visions as a
rifle ball might shatter a pane of glass
pay attention cant you see theres
customers waiting

  it w ras mr howland the refined
floorwalker who had interrupted with


top-notch magazine

tremulous fingers cheridah tucked the
valentine beneath the long tray and
bent her attentions upon serving the
customers which the big sign-to-
day at  c-lured to the counter

  for the rest of the day some vague
fear possessed her that the valentine
might be sold and to prevent such a
catastrophe she determined to keep it
hidden where she had first slipped it-
beneath the tray and the showcase of
course forty-nine cents wasnt any
great sum but to cheridah it repre-
sented half a days work and where
one figured debits and credits as close-
ly as she was compelled to-owing to a
generous salary from the department
store-a five-cent piece loomed as large
as a full moon but saturday night
was pay night and then she would buy
it if for nothing more than to take
home and hang on the nail in the wall
that now held her curling irons

  foolish she tried to persuade her-
self that it was foolish for her to do
this but somehow like a dose of bitter
medicine it wouldnt down of course
hezekiah saunders had long since for-
gotten her she had treated him
shamefully back home when he vised to
carry her books from the little country
school and sometimes take her to the
barn dances and to the ice-cream socials
at the church

  and hezekiah-poor faithful boy-
had been the only one at the train that
day she left the little country town of
geetuckett and set her face toward
great pitiless new york he had urged
her to remain he was buying a farm
-a very good one too soon he would
be able to move upon it and if she
would only come with him and-and

- how he had pressed her warm

lingers for the last time and fought
manfully against the tears that would
not stay back

  ill wait for you cheridah he had
said just before the train started
theres nothing in the city but misery
and pain and sorrow youll find out
pretty soon and youll come back

  but cheridah being seventeen and
believing she possessed a wonderful
voice only pitied the boy hadnt her

friends told her she was just cut out
for grand opera

  after all she reasoned to herself
hez is only a farmer boy and he
doesnt know

  in her own narrow way she saw the
heights to climb and the worlds to win
how foolish it was of hezekiah to
think she could stay on the old farm
and fight down the ambition which
leaped like fire in her veins she was
made for a greater world than that she
was born to dwell in the city of big
things so she had put him out of her
mind it is easy at seventeen when art
beckons

  but a mere voice proved to be unre-
liable as a provider of food shelter
and clothes a hall bedroom soon be-
came her palace and the supreme
lunch her banquet hall determina-
tion once so firmly rooted shriveled up
like a thirsty flower so the three years
exacted their toll by painting little
shadows beneath her eyes and chiseling
tiny lines around her mouth and press-
ing a heavy hand on her slim shoulders
when her money was all gone-the pit-
tance left by her mothers will-and
the voice found no market cheridah
gained an existence in return for labor
at the store stupendous

  for the first year hezekiah had writ-
ten often the second less frequently
probably because she found little time
in which to answer him the last year
had brought silence besides she had
moved often and had neglected to men-
tion the new address

ii

that night in the seclusion of her

	hall bedroom-what a poor place
in comparison to the one she slept in un-
der the low eaves at home on the farm
with the apple tree brushing the win-
dow and the crickets singing out in the
dim sweet-smelling meadows and the
clean air that fairly made one glad they
were alive-cheridah went to the bot-
tom of her trunk and found hezekiahs
picture then she gave way to tears

  after a while bessie tapped at the
door and came in bessie was another
cheridahs valentine



cog in the business wheel of the store
stupendous the two girls lived at the
same dreary boarding house bessie
saw the photograph on cheridahs
dresser went over and studied it criti-
cally

  hes a nice clean-looking chap she
observed

  cheridah nodded why hadnt she
thought so three years ago 

  do you love him bessie asked

  oh bess and before she was
really aware of it cheridah was pour-
ing out the whole story

  thats all this old burg is made up
of was bessies comment the too-
late folks the kind that chuck real
happiness for a lot of glitter lis-
ten here cherry this towns like
frosting on a cake of soap it tastes
fine until you bite deep its all froth
and false alarm and there isnt anything
on the level believe your aunt bess
i know ive been here for ten years

  did you come here to- cheri-
dah began

  no bessie shook her head i
came here because i had to there
wasnt anything else for me to do but

you- why if any man had offered

me his love and the beautiful country
for a home and freedom from this
grinding city id have thanked heaven
every weekday and twice on sunday
get that 

  i didnt know-then cheridah fal-
tered i didnt know i thought i was
being held down on a farm i thought
all the real folks lived in the city and-

and- she broke down and sobbed

oh to see the waving fields once more
bess and to hear the old dinner bell
and to eat flapjacks again thats life
isnt it

  bessie nodded all but the flap-
jacks she said they are too much
like the wheats theyre always brown-
ing at the supreme lunch

  and to pick the wild flowers
cheridah went on her voice low to
help with the haying and hunt for nests
in the stubble and i remember the old
apple tree that used to whisper at my
bedroom window and tell me the most
wonderful stories of course they were

all dreams but-but i know the old
tree told them to me all the birds used
to love it too and in the spring it would
deck itself with the most wonderful
pink-and-white flowers

  bessie was still gazing at the picture
havent you ever heard from him
since he quit writing i mean heard
about him she asked

  i used to get a paper once in a
while cheridah answered i dont
know who sent it sometimes id read
about him hes got the farm all paid

for now and-and-

  and probably hes found another
girl bessie said men are that way
you cant blame them after all maybe
hes married and got a nice home and
living the real life

  a great lump came into cheridahs
throat it must have been about the
size of one of the wee oranges at the
supreme lunch and the only way she
could conquer it was to cry bessie
dropped the picture and put both arms
consolingly about her

  there there she said like a
mother of course it hurts dear but
dont let it get your goat ive got so
i dont think theres anything in life
worth crying over honest i dont
that night long after bessie had
gone and the little room was flooded
with moonlight cheridah lay in bed
her face buried in the pillow at times
she would stop crying and listen for the
whispering of the old apple tree and
then she would remember

iii

tr the next two days cheridah
 guarded the valentine with all the
jealous care of a mother watching her
babe one day at the noon hour when
the shoppers were few and she was
alone behind the counter she wrote her
name very faintly under the flying cu-
pid she didnt mean to keep it there-
but suddenly the refined and dignified
mr howland pounced upon her and
she had to return it to the usual hiding
place

  on saturday she found that bessie
was ordered to help her at the valen-


top-notch magazine

tine counter at noon cheridah went
out to get a bag of peanuts for lunch
and when she returned the valentine
counter had been removed

  your counters in the rear of the
basement mr howland explained
hurriedly we needed this space for
the silk remnants

  almost frantically cheridah gained
the counter and relieved bessie the
lirst thing she did was to feel beneath
the long tray then the truth crashed
upon her the trays in being removed
had disclosed the valentine and some
one had tossed it back among the others
with eager fingers cheridah searched
the jumbled mass over but it was
useless the flying doves and the cupid
had been sold

  her heart sank it was foolish of
course to allow such an insignificant
thing as a gaudy paper valentine with
some grotesque bad rhymes in broken
english to affect her but somehow de-
spite her mental argument she felt mis-
erable heartbroken when she got
back to the store stupendous bessie
greeted her with wondering eyes

  say pal were her words youre
looking too pale around the gills to be
in right whats eating you now
oh nothing cheridah evaded
just blue i guess

  at nine oclock that saturday night
when the store closed cheridah hurried
out alone avoided the regular route and
walked all the way home it was misty
and chilly and the first sharp particles
of hardened snow were slanting with
the wind and stabbing at her cheeks
broadway was ablaze with lights and
animated with crowds despite the
weather cheridah darted off into a
side street and continued on her way
the next day sunday she spent in
her room she refused to go out with
bessie

  why wont you tell me whats the
matter bessie asked maybe theres
something i could do to help you
dearie

but cheridah only shook her head
theres nothing you can do thanks
on monday cheridah felt so ill-not
knowing for certain whether it was

mental or physical pain-that she sent
word down by bessie that she was un-
able to work

  at five oclock eager for a breath of
fresh air she got out the warmest wraps
she had and determined to take a walk
around the block several times while
she was dressing the doorbell rang she
paid no attention to it until it occurred
to her that the maid and landlady were
both out she hurried downstairs into
the dim hall and opened the door to
find an angry messenger boy in the ves-
tibule

  are you miss cherry-day haw-
kins he inquired impatiently stamp-
ing his cold feet

  yes im miss hawkins she re-
plied wondering

  heres somethin for yer the boy
thrust it into her extended hand sign
dis right dere pie pushed a book at
her

  she signed and the messenger dashed
away when she had shut the door and
lighted the gas she looked again at the
packet in her hand with pulses aflut-
ter she broke the cord and seal the
paper came away then she leaned
back dizzily against the hatrack it
was the precious valentine

  what did it mean who could have
sent it who knew her address except
-- she started bessie must have
done this as a surprise for her yes
surely it was bessie but---

  quite absently she lifted the flap
for a moment the ten-cent store pic-
tures on the wall whirled in her vision
only a frantic ringing of the bell again
brought her back to realization she
groped her way toward the door as if
in the dark she opened it

  cheridah somebody cried she
could not utter a sound try as she did
she stumbled forward as if some
mighty hand had pushed her then a
pair of strong arms gathered her close

  cherry dear the familiar voice
was saying ive found you-found
you at last sweetheart

  she opened her eyes and saw clearly
now the warm eager blood surged
in her veins  her heart pounded
cheridahs valentine



  oh hezekiah oh hezekiah i
that was all she could say

  he kissed her on the cheeks and acci-
dentally on the left ear

  ive had the hardest time finding
you he said laughing although his
eyes were moist why didnt you
write me why-

  oh ive-ive been ashamed she
stammered

  i came into new york last week
he said and ive been looking the
town over day after day i stood and
watched the rushing crowds on broad-
way thinking to see yotir face and
then the other day i went into a store
and saw some valentines and right
on top of the whole pile was the dove-
and-cupid one-the same kind i sent
you a long time ago at school the one
with the funny dutch words remem-
ber he laughed boyishly and patted
her cheek cheridah clung to him she
would hold him close as long as possible
before she woke up-if it should turn
out to be a dream

  yes the very same kind of valen-
tine cherry she heard him saying
and lord my eyes got so wet i
felt ashamed but i bought it i dont
even know what made me i guess
some good angel does though he

ing for joy

amusing recollections
in a recent volume of european court reminiscences are a couple of stories about

	americans one concerns a genial yankee who on being presented to leo
xiii exclaimed as he seized the popes hand and shook it heartily sir i am
glad to meet you i knew your father the late pope

    then there was the american multimillionaire who visited oxford and
paused to admire the wonderful smooth grass turf in one of the college quad-
rangles

thats fine he said to a gardener how do you manage to get it

    oh thats quite simple sir was the reply youve only got to roll it
for three hundred years

    there is a story too- of bismarck and von moltke which illustrates the
character of the latter in a very striking manner it was in  when the
prussians invaded jutland and were taking possession of fredericia von moltke
had strongly disapproved of the war so that it was much against his will that
as a conquering warrior he was obliged to enter the city which had sheltered
his boyhood he knew every street and house in it bismarck had never seen
it before and looked around him curiously

    that is a fine house he remarked pointing to a large imposing building
which cast all the others into the shade i will take up my quarters there

very appropriate replied von moltke dryly that is the state prison

organ and she tells him that when she de-
cides to invite him she will place a sprig
of the evergreen madrona bush on a high
rock which he can see from his boat he
promises to respond to the signal

  the girl tells her father and friends of
the incident and capstan culbertson bitter
with jealousy and natural enmity steals to
the rocks and displays the madrona-bush

they pay a formal call upon iotte montana

dick tries to place capstan under arrest
but the big pirate seizes him about the waist
and hurls him far out into the dark waters

chapter vii
ciiatlas perilous voyage

hat la moved about the
house attending to her simple
duties pondering dicks prot-
estations that he desired to
become better acquainted with
her people that he would put many a
dollar into the pocket of iotte if she
would but let him every lesson of her
lifetime among the pirates-men ever
hunted and spied upon-had taught her
beyond the law



caution where strangers were con-
cerned she suspected that dicks mo-
tives were not of the best although her
fealty to her people and the young
mans relationship to bill melton rather
than any tangible act gave rise to this
the more she thought about the situa-
tion the more she caught herself try-
ing to believe no ill of the handsome
young stranger

  many times passing from the kitchen
to the living room she paused beside
the precious organ her papa iotte
wise esteemed and venerated by all the
fisherfolk of the sound had told her
that the organ under an inspired hand
pealed forth the very spirit of gods
love

  how gloriously dick played could a
mind bent and warped with evil wicked
thoughts still keep mastery over all the
subtleties of this noble instrument  her
simple faith founded upon the syl-
logism that music is good and that he
who makes music cannot therefore be
bad began to writhe in the first pain-
ful throes of unbelief

  but if dick meditated treachery
toward capstan and papa iotte and
uncle sky-and her instinct insisted
that he did-she had played him nicely
a trace of a smile rested upon her face
as she pictured the lonesome midnight
trip to hales pass a part of the bay
remote from where she had heard
capstan say he intended to go

  the afternoon wore away more rap-
idly than she realized and the long
slant shadows of the tall firs paying
their good-night visit to the clean shiny
floor of her kitchen started her to won-
dering where her father could be

  capstan she surmised from her
knowledge of the manner in which the
crafty pirate waged his campaigns
against the traps in all probability had
started hours before headed ostensibly
for some point far distant from the
real object of the nights attack

  darkness came on and she laid the
dishes for the evening meal still iotte
did not come a dozen canoes laden
with lummi indians whose reserva-
tion lay a short distance back of the
fish camp landed on the beach she

  could hear the natives with sacks of
clams upon their backs chattering in
the trail leading into the forest

  several times she stepped to the door
and when finally a match flickered and
a candle was lighted in the cabin of
uncle sky a dozen rods distant her
heart gave a sudden bound and fleetly
she ran down the path to the old mans
hut

  uncle sky you did not go with
capstan 

  no that there capstan is a-gettin
too all-fired fol-de-rol-dy he figgers
that hes perter than i be he even fig-
gers that iotte is perter than i be he
wouldnt let me go he took your father
instead working his countenance
into the terrifying rage which he pre-
tended to feel the old man declared
that as soon as the young giant returned
he fully intended to take him across
his knee and belt him a couple just for
luck

  did papa iotte go too demanded
the girl anxiously uncle skys humor-
ous blandishments for once lost upon
her

  yes why that aint nothin-

  but it is far to point roberts the
nights are chill there is the danger
now now chatla baby dont you
worrit to begin with they didnt go
to roberts nohow capstan heered
something they changed their minds
theyve went to the pass

  mumbling something she knew not
what chatla turned away from the old
mans door and stumbled home there
upon the threshold she sank and gave
a loose rein to the fears and uncer-
tainties which assailed her

  her father and capstan had gone to
the pass there also she had directed
dick melton-deputy sheriff dick
melton-to go

  wrhen she had supposed that capstan
and uncle sky were out upon the
desperate venture-though she loved
them both dearly-she had felt but little
anxiety with her father it was dif-
ferent  now that she knew he had gone
forth with capstan the situation as-
sumed an aspect of threat and terror

the arguments in dicks favor into
which she had tried to beguile herself
she now completely abandoned

  she had told him that capstan was
going to the pass that night in her
bungling attempts to play tricks with
the handsome young stranger she had
sent him she had supposed upon a
wild-goose chase but in reality to the
very trap which her father and cap-
stan proposed that night to raid

  i told dick melton that capstan and
uncle sky were going to hales pass
she thought bitterly and they have
gone papa lotte instead of uncle sky
they will be arrested xo capstan will
not be arrested often i have heard
him say so they must kill him to get
him he would protect papa lotte to
the death but if harm should
come-

  she took one hurried glance at the
tiny clock ticking upon a shelf pulled
herself together and fled down the
trail straight to where her own light
cedar skiff lay hauled above high-water
mark on the beach

  she seized the boat by the gunwale
ran it into the water and sprang in
drawing her breath sharply she drove
the craft rapidly through the choppy
sea which the land breeze had begun to
raise

  nine oclock nine oclock

  nearly ten miles she had to go part
of the distance favored by the tide
the remainder dead against it mid-
night she knew was the hour when
capstan and her father would lead the
attack upon the trap she must get
there before that hour and warn them

  she slipped her simple calico waist
from her arms and shoulders to give her
freedom and bent to her oars recover-
ing her strokes easily unhurriedly as
capstan had taught her but throwing
every ounce of her supple strength into
the pull when she dipped the blades

  so long as the shore line remained
visible she laid her course by a lone
fir upon the bank keeping the middle
of the stern of the skiff in a line with
this majestic sentinel

  when she had gone about two miles

the shore line pulled away sharply and
trimming her course anew she ran into
the heavy head swells that swept in
from the open her frail bark pitched
and reared alarmingly in the heavy sea
but to save both time and strength
shaking the salt spray from her naked
arms and shoulders she pulled fear-
lessly into the trough of the wave

  a mile of such perilous going and
she came again into tranquil water
when her muscles cramped she shifted
her position and sculled the boat thrust-
ing the sweeps away from her fisher-
man fashion by this maneuver she
lost some time but it rested her and
again she bent to her work

  at the lower end of lummi island
the water she knew would again be
rough in preparation for this last and
most dangerous lap of the race against
the sinister fate which she feared she
had brought down upon her father and
her suitor ishe rested a moment per-
mitting the boat to forge ahead under
its own impetus when finally she felt
the first swells of the rougher water be-
yond she swung into the teeth of the
waves and rowed as never before

  a dozen times the skiff shipped a sea
the water in the bottom of the boat
halfway to her shoe tops made the
craft loggy and unmanageable but still
she kept on she dared not turn back
now even if she would

  flirting the spray from her eyes by a
quick jerk of her head she turned every
minute and looked over her shoulder
at last the dim outlines of the trap ap-
peared fatigue had begun to tell upon
her at each stroke she was dipping her
oars deeper and deeper still she floun-
dered on the sight of the goal eking
out the strength which was all but gone

  her benumbed grasp tore loose from
one oar strive as she might for sev-
eral seconds she could not open her
fingers sufficiently to grasp the handle
of the sweep the tide rips had seized
her craft were bearing it away back
over the course whence she had come
when she heard the faint sputter of a
high-powered engine a second later
the hoarse bark of a second launch
sounded out and a clumsy power yawl
beyond the law



its lines familiar even in the darkness
plowed by her then a searchlight be-
gan to sweep the bay

  in an instant it seemed to her the
two launches had come together there
wras a shout sounds of a terrific fight
oaths shouts and she sank to her knees
in the water which covered the bottom
of her skiff

  too late too late

  the tide bore her boat along un-
heeded in a moment she heard again
the familiar exhaust of the dolly var-
den the power boat was making in
an opposite direction for the island

  they didnt get them they didnt
get them she fairly screamed

  capstan she well knew would never
leave her father a prisoner unless a
bullet had done its deadly work capstan
had added another victory to his
desperate record

  joy and thanksgiving that her blun-
der had not cost the lives of her loved
ones welled up within her breast then
she realized that she was cold she
slipped on her waist and picked up the
oars for the long and dangerous home-
ward pull she had just dipped the
blades when a gasping terrible gurgle
of a drowning man sounded right be-
side her

  she flung out her hands in terror
there an oars length away a human
hand lifted itself feebly from the salt
chuck and fell back then a head ap-
peared a face deathly white in its last
agony upturned itself and looked at
her then sank from view

  she gave a tremendous pull upon the
starboard oar leaned over and grasped
a handful of human hair

  hauling the body to the surface she
gunwaled it as capstan had taught her
to do by linking the helpless arm and
leg over the rail of her skiff holding
the hand and the foot of the senseless
body in place against the side of her
boat by crushing them beneath her own
feet she flung herself backward with
all her strength slowly the skiff set-
tled to an even keel and she fell for-
ward across the dank insensate heap
lying in the bottom

the musatchie hand

 tlie roof pitched steeply over the
 house of iotte montana the
 round cedar joists covered with hand-
 hewn cedar shakes gathered snugly
 about the tiny attic room impregnating
 the air with a pleasant balsam upon
 the low walls of this chatlas room
 were hung resplendently beaded war
 bags prototypes of the leather and
 plush chatelaines carried by the pale-
  face sisters and baskets of the thinnest
 and toughest grass fiber woven so
 closely that one might carry water with-
 in for a three days journey the brim
 and upper portions ornamented in blue
 and yellow and red pigment with the
 good-luck sign and the totem bird of
 the luminis upon the floor were the
 skins of deer hand-tanned as soft and
 as white as chamois

   the sole concession to modern inno-
 vation in the room was a white iron
 bedstead relieved from the garishriess
 of department-store splendor by a hand-
 woven counterpane of wool which was
 draped to the floor

   the ladder stairwav creaked and as

 the head and shoulders of a girl ap-
 peared through the trapdoor in the
 floor a pale face turned wearily upon
 the pillow but brightened at the pres-
 ence of the girl

   better

  yes chatla im not much of a
 success as a policeman am i 

   the girl gazed down upon the young
 mans face after a moment with the
 tactless abruptness of her people she
 answered

   no youre no good as a policeman
 you know capstan now

   yes he knew capstan the reputa-
 tion bestowed upon that worthy had not
 in the light of a recent personal ex-
 perience been lightly or inconsiderately
 estimated

   we will not talk of it said chatla
 sinking with graceful ease to a position
 upon the floor you are here i bring
 you here it is because you are sick
 no harm comes to you while you are
 under the roof of papa iotte capstan

knows it but too well he goes away
mad-no one knows where-mad very
mad

  ill be all right very soon ex-
postulated dick lifting a hand tenta-
tively as soon as i am able i shall
go home but never never to forget
what you have done for me

  he permitted his hand to fall weakly
in her direction with head and eyes
averted she laid her own brown fingers
in his wan white ones thus they re-
mained for some minutes until by tel-
epathy perhaps he read her thought
and asked about the music

  you acted so strangely chatla that
day the first day when i came with
miss proctor and played for you w hat
was it i played ah yes the largo
i had forgotten the piece but not the
look that was upon your face when i
finished what did the music say to
you chatla

  she withdrew her hand from his
grasp and folded it within the other
in her lap away among the verdant
arches of the pines whose vista showed
through the tiny many-paned window
of her room were the friendly little
spirits with whom of late she more and
more frequently communecl now at
dicks word the longing of her smol-
dering brown eyes brought them to her
and from without the windowpane they
waved their secrets to her with their
eerie hands

  the music spoke to me-here
chatla laid her hand to her breast it
is easy to say i go you come the
day is done night hastens but to say
whither the day goes or whence the
night comes-is hard

  dick studied her a moment then
gently encouragingly

  tell me what the music said dont
be ashamed chatla i tried that day
to make the pipes talk wliat did they
say tell me chatla

  the music says to me she began
so faintly that he could hardly hear it
says some one is lonely suffers is
hungry several are speaking in the
music where shall i go  says one
the trail is blind and dark i stumble
and i am hungry whither shall i go

two hands point out the ways are
different both hands are white and
good to look upon then a tender voice
whispers  wait wait the other
voice louder and stronger says come
where it is gay away to the white mans
world

  confused i wait and suffer and
hunger but by and by the pain grows
less and i know that the voice that
whispers wait is not the voice of evil
ah yes then i know the music tells
me one hand pointing is the hand
of duty it is fair the other hand
the hand of sin turns black the tnn-
satchie hand

  rapt entranced chatla continued to
gaze through the narrow window while
dick reached out for her hand

  how good it is chatla when we
clear away the artificial the false and
all shamming this is a sacred moment
chatla you show me your heart a
corner at least and it is a simple good
trusting heart and white

  angrily with cheeks flaming she
drew away her hand i am the
daughter of the tyees she exclaimed
proudly when your kind toiled and
slunk about like hutch rabbits my peo-
ple in a cedar canim sailed seas that the
timid sons of boston men dared scarcely
cross in a cannon ship when my peo-
ple wanted meat they slew the deer
when they wanted skins to cover them
they hunted to the den and killed the
great north bear partly i am the flesh
of iotte montana white but within i
feel i know i am the daughter of the
tyees

  chatla he expostulated astounded
at her passionate outburst you do not
understand why chatla do you think
i would twit you with your drop of in-
dian blood no no i meant that your
heart was white was good

  the savage glint in her eyes faded
away impulsively she thrust her hand
into his it is good said she simply

  i was starting to say chatla that
when your heart yearns for something
when you are fearful and undecided
when you do not know whether your
message will meet with acceptance and
understanding or derision and rebuff
beyond the law



how good it is to have some one come
into your life utter your own thoughts
and hopes as if they were living them
and feel them with you if you and i
could live just one whole day think-
ing seeing as if with but one brain
one heart one pair of eyes why that
would be-that would be love the love
we all dream about but never experi-
ence except for some such fleeting mo-
ment as that which you and i just lived
through some day when i am recov-
ered from this foolish cracked rib you
will let me come to see you wront you
and walk in the woods with you in your
bower where we both may hear the
fairies speak may i come

  the girl clasped her hands to her
face her breast rose and fell like a
troubled sea her cheeks he could see
between her fingers were wet

  may i come chatla shall we talk
and think and commune together hunt-
ing for the spirit of the pipes

  he laid his hand upon her head and
as she started to arise he put his arm
about her waist and drew her to him
her eyes shining gloriously a flush
covering the natural dusky hue of her
skin she sank upon his breast a mo-
ment thus she lay slowly gently he
turned her face until her lips met his

  a scream shattered the tense stillness
of the attic room backward sprang
the girl her eyes starting in horror a
finger pointed at him dramatically

  see it is the musatchie hand it
beckons chatla to be bad to be miser-
able to perish i see it i see it

  fleeing as if from some noisome
presence she lifted the trapdoor in the
floor and rapidly descended the ladder

rick by his express wash although
the girl expostulated against his
removal until he had completely recov-
ered his strength wras taken from
iottes house to uncle skys cabin con-
strained embarrassed yet evincing
every desire to make him comfortable

and to hasten his recovery chatla con-
tinued to prepare the meals for the in-
voluntary guest smoothed his pillows
whenever she came to the house and
made his surroundings as homelike as
she knew how

  while dick remained in skys cabin
never once did he and chatla exchange
a look which did not bring a flush to
their faces restraint and awkwardness
to their conversation

  his own position however was not
as difficult as chatlas a fact which he
came to understand forcibly one after-
noon when the old mans voice pitched
louder than usual he heard lotte mon-
tana in his own cabin admonish his
daughter not to remain an instant longer
in skys cabin than was necessary to
give young melton his meals

  but papa lotte he heard the girl
say in expostulation it means nothing
you know that capstan-

  the door of iottes cabin slammed
shut leaving the remainder of the sen-
tence to conjecture

  not until dick had been at the fish
camp nearly a week did his father bill
melton come to visit him

  the deputies who had just managed
to beach the atarcissus on the rocky isle
the night of the ineffectual attempt to
arrest capstan and montana sent
frantic word to melton senior that his
son had either been captured and spir-
ited away by the gigantic pirate or had
fallen overboard and drowned

  a sheriffs posse was sent posthaste
to the fish camp where they were met
at the landing by the majestic lotte
montana

  young melton is here in my house
he is hurt not badly but will require
quiet and rest is it so bad that an army
must turn out when montana is hon-
ored with a visit asked the old man
sarcastically fixing the chief deputy
with a cold look

  he was glad all-fired glad to hear
that dick was all right said the deputy
and he would convey the information
to mr melton at once

  when a few days later bill melton
in company with miss proctor landed
at the fish camp from one of the can-

nery tugs all of the pomp and circum-
stance of the millionaires habitual pres-
ence left him he was about to meet
two old companions men whom he had
not seen twice in fifteen years but with
whom in the old days he had joined in
many a desperate venture

  pretense the insolence of wealth and
power would not pass current here he
knew so to uncle sky he extended an
obtrusively friendly hand attempting
rather dismally to return in kind the
facetious salutation of that ubiquitous
humorist iotte montana bestowed a
stately bow upon his visitors which was
acknowledged by miss proctor with a
pleasant nod and by melton with a con-
scious bob of his pudgy figure

my boy here iotte where is he
montana pointed a long knobby fin-
ger along a trail which once upon a
time bill melton had known as well as
any indian on the island

  id like to see him iotte so would
miss ada if you dont mind

  montana without returning any an-
swer led on toward his own cabin fol-
lowed by bill melton uncle sky loi-
tering behind was proffering miss
proctor some rather crude and perplex-
ing gallantries on the strength of the
fact that the young lady and himself
had both been born in boston the
trifling period of half a century or so
only having intervened between those
interesting events

  boston well well miss ada i
come from boston town myself as
i told you before i went to sea as a
boy in the days of the clipper ship
around the horn frisco-then here
say i helped old man puget dig the
sound mount baker there yonder-
well that was a hole in the ground when
i come i helped tote the dirt to fill er
up boston well well

  miss proctor awaiting her polite and
well-bred opportunity to interpolate an
insistent question which had been both-
ering her a great deal managed finally
to stop the old mans clatter long enough
to ask him rather pointedly just exactly
what had happened to dick

  i am at a loss to understand the
providential manner of his escape she

said suspiciously tell me what
miracle saved our dear dicky

  uncle sky suddenly become cadgy
swore that he disremembered just how
dick got fished out of the water they
was a fight i know that said the old
man cocking his head comically a
tearing rippin fight

  but ill inquire ill inquire he
promised his eyes twinkling mis-
chievously i know you young girls
is a little delicate about asking after
them matters yourselves and showin
too much interest in a young feller but
ill find out all about it and you-you
meet me here on the trail and ill tell
you all about it

  miss proctor protested that the mat-
ter was not of sufficient moment to
justify such ample and mysterious ar-
rangements and walked on

  arriving at his cabin ahead of bill
melton iotte swungthe door open and
invited his old-time partner to enter
uncle sky and miss proctor were just
coming into sight around a bend in the
trail

  dick is in skys cabin explained
iotte but i wanted just a word with
you

  not now replied melton sharply
i want to see dick where is he
take me to him

  the millionaire moved toward the
door just as chatla entered from the
rear and miss proctor and uncle sky
from the front the boston girl
rushed toward chatla with her fashion-
able handshake while melton his gaze
wild and staring looked upon mon-
tanas daughter as upon one risen from
the dead in answer to a tug at his
sleeve and the word that they would go
to skys house the cannery man de-
manded to know of iotte who the girl
was

  uncle sky answered instead

  why bill dont you remember
her when she was just a handful
course you do thats chatla baby
you know

  a vision from out the long ago
blurred the eyes of the salmon king
and he stumbled along the path leading
tb the old cripples hut
beyond the law



  the greeting of father and son was
brusque but kindly ada reese proc-
tor presently tiptoed in and laid her
hand in dicks where it remained for
some seconds

  your recovery dicky dear said
she i trust will be uneventful and
rapid this extraordinary denouement
has given a sad twist to our vacation
plans no matter though if youll
hurry like a good dear dicky boy and
get well she leaned and whispered a
word in his ear and was gone

  iotte and uncle sky out of a rigid
sense of what was due a guest re-
mained a moment then departed leav-
ing the meltons father and son alone

  you sheer oft this siwash squaw
dick do you hear

  why father

  now dick your old dad has mixed
with em in his day i know what im
talkin about it wont do it wont

other night and where i could nab this
cutthroat and this grayheaded fox

ise readily enough

lived in these parts thirty year my boy
and ive seen wiser men than you tangle
themselves for good and all time but
i didnt go to hurt your feelings son
when will you be up and about again

  i could go home now father if
necessary im feeling pretty shaky
but i guess i could stand the trip this
thump on the head has made me pretty
weak

  a look of genuine affection stole over
the knobby rugged features of the can-
nery king no no said he in his
decisive commanding manner well
take no chances a few days more or
less dont matter uncle sky--for old
times sake-will keep you a while
longer i think youll be as good as
ever in a week this here little episode
aint goin to make any difference in
the original plans as soon as youre
fit i want you to jump right in again
and clean out this pirate outfit for good
and all theres a truce on now
thats all right the minute you plant
foot in the narcissus the wars begun
again ive fixed the boat up good as
new

  now good-by dick ill have the
tug stop every day anti somebody in-
quire come home just as soon as you
can and remember what ive said to
you for your own good a tangle with
a klootch and good-by to miss ada
proctor of boston good-by money

  dick did his best to conceal a look
of hearty disgust as he reached out a
rather limp hand to bid his father adieu

  halfway between the two cabins
melton encountered chatla leaning
forward he thrust his face insolently
into hers and as she started to draw
back he seized her by the chin and tilted
her head this way and that studying the

features which recalled something
somebody vaguely to his memory

 when chatla her face burning
angrily had passed on iotte montana
stepped from the underbrush

  i see you remember chatla bill

  she aint a bad-lookin klootch iotte

where- melton struck suddenly

dumb by the look of rage on montanas
face paused his lips parted showing
his teeth

  you know her bill no use to try
and fool me and i want to say just
a word further bill she and your boy
are friendly altogether too friendly
youve got to put a stop to it i cant
as you know explain to the girl

  what are you lungin at iotte i
dont know the klootch from a horse
clam

  yes you do bill dont try to lie
to me come with me well go and
have just a word with sky

  in answer to a call uncle sky came
tottering down the path and the three
old men stepped aside from the trail
melton soon left the conference how-
ever anti calling miss proctor boarded
his tug and sailed away uncle sky
as lie and montana emerged from the
shadows of the trees was laying down
the law slapping his knobby forefinger
vigorously into his palm

  youre a durncd old fool iotte
youre a-reachin out after trouble
sure

  its the girls welfare partly sky
that i am thinking about but more the
cause of the people ive planned it
and prayed over it ever since chatla was
a tcnas

  oh it aint that totte replied
uncle sky impatiently i dont never
question what youre drivin at its
the way youve got of goin at it this
figgerin so far in advance and layin
out plans that somebody else has got to
trim their happiness to fit aint sensi-
ble and whats more it aint fair

  still disputing the two old men en-
tered lottes cabin

  bill melton as his tug drew away
from the island swore loudly and vi-
ciously despite the presence of miss
ada reese proctor of boston them

old devils is plannin to grab me for a
piece of hush money said he bitterly
pacing the narrow deck the devil of
it is when they state their price i guess
id better come up i wish dick was
out of there i wish id brought him
with me and took the risk of settin
him back as soon as that boy is home
im goin to make the sound too hot
to hold them old mud sharks

liagle and gull

to those who live near to nature
she gives prodigally of her secrets
teaches them the subtleties of her hid-
den lore endows them at least in part
with the instincts of the birds and
beasts thus capstan-no man or
woman having conveyed to him the tid-
ings-knew when dick melton pro-
nounced sufficiently recovered to at-
tempt the journey home had embarked
upon the tug which bore him still pale
and weak to the home of his father

  capstan the evening following the
departure of dick his blankets rolled
into the habitual turkey of the fisher-
man or logger walked into the fish
camp

  he beckoned chatla aside what
you tryin to do chatla tryin to
throw me for that dudish dicky bird 
watch out i aint to be fooled with

  why capstan you know better

ady broctor you dont want to think
and i aint dicky melton im a fish
pirate youre a lummi siwash indian
beyond the law



squaw a klootchman dont forget it
and make yourself or me out plumb
rediculous

  chatlas eyes glinted ominously a
dusky flush burned upon her cheek as
she drew herself proudly erect and
gave the giant one contemptuous look
never before had he seen her exhibit
such spirit such independence fling-
ing her head in a little characteristic
toss she turned without a word and
started for the house

  the pirate grasped her by the sleeve
fearful that if he permitted her to go
away this time never could he hope to
come to any understanding with her
his rage dispossessed by sadness sud-
denly abated still holding to her arm
his enormous body slouching contritely
his was a figure truly pitiful

  i aint went at it right to talk to
you chatla he began humbly that
there talk was too raw i know but i
was beatin up to the goal the best i
knew how you know surely what im
tryin to say listen chatla baby i
and you is tillicums i packed you on
my back when you was just a little
yelpin kid and i was a big-boned geek
of a boy your papa lotte has been
my dad too leastways the only one
ive ever had and i and him has had
lots of talks its been understood-be-
tween i and him anyway-about i and
you i wish id a gone to school some
i wish i had lottes way of explainin
things then maybe i could show you
just where youre driftin to im up
agin a hard game

  still chatla stood her head turned
away so that he could not see the ex-
pression which flitted across her
features

  you aint goin to throw down in
one second what i and you has been
buildin on for twenty year be you 
ever since you wasnt no bigger than a
clams foot ive figgered ahead for us
two  lets not stand here like this
lets i and you walk down the trail a
piece like weve done a thousand times
like we done nearly every evenin until
until-just lately

  the anger which had so inflamed her
resentment all had gone it was a tear-

ful face which she turned toward cap-
stan a shaky hand which she placed
timidly in his and as they walked
slowly down the trail she allowed her
head to droop farther and farther for-
ward upon her breast

  beside the gnarled roots of a madrona
tree they halted

  we always ought to walk on to-
gether just like we done now said
capstan and its a-comin out all
right i know it is i and you from
now on is goin on together just like we
always done i dont blame you for get-
tin notions from them outsiders but
we aint like them it aint in the cards
for you to live like this miss proctor
or for me to have forty-thousand-dol-
lar boats like dicky bird i seen trou-
ble cornin the minute young meltons
boat hove around the point why
chatla us wild fellers can tell when
poachers is coinin just as plain as a she
bear can tell when one of them eastern
tourists is huntin her babys pelt for a
fireplace rug its plumb rediculous
you aint fitten to be dick meltons
wife and of course he knows it too
i dont have to talk no plainer do i 

  on the bark of the madrona tree
were carved two hearts and two sets of
initials rudely intertwined to form the
monograms cmcc

  there chatla look there you re-
member when i and you walked out
here once and i cut them letters  see
how them letters is twined together
chatla thats just the way i and
you has growed up nothin cant never
tear us apart

  chatla stood for a long time without
replying gazing all the time at cap-
stans handiwork upon the bark of the
blood bush finally she answered
speaking slowly choosing her words
as one who has at heart a great con-
viction

  wte have grown up together cap-
stan tis true so do the eagle and the
soft-breasted gull make aerie upon the
same rock only later to fly their sev-
eral ways the rhododendron capstan
timid and sweet in the brakes and un-
derbrush transplanted to a garden free
from weeds blooms proudly gloriously

tenfold stronger than in its dark na-
tive vales

  capstan catching instantly the
thought which lay behind her metaphor
reached his great hands toward her sup-
plicatingly still she spoke on

  then too capstan the blood bush
is not enduring of all the trees of
the forest it first repairs its hurts
these letters von have carved in a year
they are gone grown over with the
madrohas new life of late i have
thought and studied am i to drift i
have asked myself or shall i take the
oars and see if the ocean is not greater
than this narrow bay  but i shall be
fair with you capstan and honest do
not speak of this again as we have
talked to-day for a long long time let
us wait and see look in my face
capstan of that other thing that fear
which you expressed i lift my hand to
the saghalie tyee and swear it no
man of that other world the world of
dick melton and the boston girl shall
make a toy a plaything of chatla now
let us go there capstan take my
hand

  hot questions burned upon the giants
lips how had dick melton known of
the expected raid upon the hales pass
trap how had chatla happened to
come so providentially to the rescue of
the young cannery man one glance
at the girls resolute face and he knew
that the topic would prove dangerous
might be forever fatal with a despair-
ing groan he followed  after chatla
toward the camp

  at the door of iottes lodge they
parted chatla instilling one tiny draft
of hope into his desolate heart when
she said wait capstan whatever
happens i shall be fair with you and
honest with you

  seated before uncle skys cabin
capstan whittled away savagely upon a
stick with his huge horn-handled knife
the softening influence of chatlas
presence gone he again blew hot with
rage and desperation

  uncle sky poking his crooked fore-
finger into the abysmal bowl of a mon-
strous pipe ambled from the house and
greeted the pirate heartily well well

capstan my huckleberry where you
been

  pointing a vague finger over his
shoulder the giant whittled on but
vouchsafed no other answer then
after a moment he threw aside the stick
and closed the knife blade

  say uncle sky-and i want this
straight-how- did dicky bird know we
was goin to the hales pass trap that
night nobody knew it but i and you
and iotte and-chatla i want to know
who told i ast that same question of
another party the other evenin and
when he didnt come through prompt i
hove him into the drink i want to
know who told whats more im goin

to make somebody tell or-

  uncle sky his attenuated trembling
figure transformed suddenly into a
bundle of highly agitated nerves and
muscles lurched forward and shook a
crooked sun-cured fist under the giants
nose you try throwin me into the
drink clem you  ill make you hard
to ketch you cool off young feller
or ill take you acrost my knee and burn
a hole in them pants of yourn

  with a look something nearer to
genuine alarm than had flashed across
his rugged face for many a day cap-
stan hastened to assure the irate old
man that he had meant no disrespect

  no qtiestioned uncle sky skep-
tically then ketch a half hitch in
your jaw tackle

  but i want to know who told in-
sisted capstan returning cautiously to
the attack

  uncle sky nibbled away sheeplike at
the stem of his pipe for a while and
directed a perplexed look off at the
horizon now that youre talkin civ-
ilized my boy im willin to own up
that maybe im the party thats to
blame i figgered that you and me was
goin to the point roberts trap so i
kind of-as a blind-let fall some idea
around that we was headed the other
way them was the plans you recol-
lect

  the storm began to gather again and
the young pirates face became dis-
torted with rage uncle sky with
many rheumatic gestures proceeded
beyond the law



to enact in pantomine just how
he had told brindle pete the towboat
man that they were planning on a little
trip to hales pass brindle is gabby
dreful gabby i figgered hed talk
around free-it bein his nature-so i
just loads brindle up plumb bustin full
of the information that i and you was
goin to the pass that must be the
way that news got out you can see
how it happened

  no shouted capstan springing to
his feet and charging about like a bear
in a deadfall not by a damned sight
do i see it chatla told dick melton
where we was goin there aint no
explainin to it she went out-crowed
ten mile-and picked him up all in the
dead of night brung him here and put
him to bed

  the giant took an agitated turn in
the path returned and whispered in
skys ear his voice choked with pas-
sion  im a-goin to start something
im goin to make a fool of this dicky
bird then im goin right over to old
meltons wikiup right into the thick
of em and kill this young blood with
my bare hands savvy that uncle sky
its capstan culbertson a-talkin you
know me

chapter xi

capstan moves a trap

a letter written upon the office
stationery of the melton cannery
company and addressed to iotte mon-
tana promised in cautious yet unmis-
takable language immunity from arrest
to capstan culbertson and to certain
of his associates if they would discon-
tinue all fish-pirating operations and
acts of violence and destruction directed
against employees or property of the
said canning company

  when iotte his face sadly grave
handed the letter to capstan without
comment the giant after an agony of
spelling eye blinkings and empty pain-
ful swallowing angrily tore the paper
and frittered the bits through his fingers
into the water at this montanas face
lighted up with a sort of savage adora-
tion and he seized capstans hand and

wrung it in the steel grip of his wiry
old fingers

  im with you capstan my boy unto
the end my counsel my prayers my
hand are yours

  these words to him were a benedic-
tion  and the pirate bent his head and
stood in an attitude of reverence iotte
walked on to his cabin

  there the nestor of the camp ad-
dressed himself to uncle sky

  sky capstan is one with the vikings
of old the savagery yes the brutal-
ity of his nature- ah wre need it

in our struggle against the oppressor
as the cougar needs his claws and teeth
when beset by the dogs chatla on the
other hand is gentle and good and has
intellect graft the daring spirit of
capstan upon the stock of her gift of
mind and soul and we shall have begun
the race of men who will set things to
rights in this unequal grasping world
uncle sky was more than willing to
subscribe to the good qualities of chatla
the courage of capstan

  i know i am right continue mon-
tana it has been the ambition of my
life to bring this thing to pass what a
mating capstan and chatla i am
justified even to the extent of employ-
ing means otherwise not honorable to
fight off the conniving of the wicked
who might endeavor to defeat this con-
summation if im wrong upon my
head descend the vengeance

  i aint dead sure youre wrong
iotte placated uncle sky but im
dreful afraid that you be it takes time
to tell iotte go slow

  again renewing the dispute which
had brought the old men together time
and again in excited and sometimes
acrimonious debate the two entered the
cabin

  capstan idly watching the bits of bill
meltons letter float away upon the tide
began to breathe more deeply more rap-
idly as his simple mind transmuted into
action that which he meditated

  ill make a fool out of dicky bird
first ill get the laugh on him from
one end of the sound to the other
everybody knows hes wearin a dinky
little star under his jacket and that hes

then-

  completely unaware that his methods
were somewhat melodramatic capstan
worked out a grievously scrawled anon-
ymous communication

  to huever is a-watchin limmi trap num-
ber  i aim to descend onto number  durin
the comin week and help myself to a dory
of humpies yours in haste

capstan culbertson

  swan nelson bad man of the mel-
ton corps of watchmen urged to the
fore by the gibes of his fellows and the
promptings of the anchor bar whisky
asked the trap foreman to detail him
to watch no 

  when the tug hove in sight of no 
on the memorable morning mr nelson
his tongu from four hours contact
with a piece of tarred canvas swollen
to the thickness of four or five tongues
his wrists striped by the cords which
bound him to a pile was discovered
lashed helpless before the watch-deck
cabin

  capstan he bane coming you see
explained swan after his much-aug-
mented tongue had resumed in a meas-
ure one of its proper functions and
he is yumping on me here be gude
fight i tell you that purty soon cap-
stan is tying me to post you see if
ever i catch this capstan i break his
dam eye

  a scowload of fish tied snugly to the
melton cannery dock was turned loose
in the night though a hundred men
worked within ten fathoms of the iron
bit to which the spring line of the scow
had been tied not content with cut-
ting the scow loose and to show that
he was capable of winding up the job in
thorough workmanlike manner cap-
stan brought the craft to anchor with
one end resting above a submerged pile
the receding tide scooping fourteen
feet of water from the bay upended
the scow and dumped the fish back into
their native element

  before dispatching the first of the
long series of letters which preceded
his most spectacular act of reprisal the
pirate had paddled his dory alongside

the no  trap where he made a critical
examination of the web spiller lead
power brail and watch eck this lat-
ter he viewed and voiced his profane
disgust that the parsimony of bill mel-
ton had restrained the cannery man
from equipping the tiny cook stove be-
neath the watch house with a sufficient
number of pieces of stovepipe

  its disgustin thats what it is
quoth the wrathful capstan that that
there stove aint got enough pipe to
give it a good draw if bill melton is
too poor to buy pipe for that stove that
keeps the watchie warm ill kick in with
a lenth of pipe myself

  in the half light of the summer twi-
light capstan was seen by a trap man
to row to no  alight from his dory
and mount to the watch deck a length
of stovepipe under his arm yvith in-
finite pains this joint of pipe handled
more carefully than any pipe had been
within the memory of the trap boy was
affixed to the jagged and rusted end of
the old pipe where it emerged from the
roof

  surveying his handiwork and pro-
nouncing it good capstan climbed back
into his dory and paddled away turn-
ing occasionally to squint along the
edge of the boat to see if the pipe were
plumb

  dont you dast say i dont fight in
the clear ran one of the many letters
sent to bill melton i dont aim to
take no advantage so i warns you that
i dont like the location of no  so i
aims to move it

  at intervals of a day or two the
pirate sent forward other messages to
the melton cannerjr all in the vein of
protestation against the location of the
no  trap the last letter capstan in-
trusted to the hand of a chinese fish
sorter who innocent of the contents de-
livered it over to the addressee with
many flourishes

  i been sendin purty plenty of word to you
bill melton just so you can pull yourself
together and get ready i aint foolin im
comin a-runnin directly number  has got
to be moved you aint makin no sign to
move it yourself so i figger the job is up
to me personal that bein the case i aim
to come next tewsday at  bells in the
beyond the law



 mornin and move that trap myself stand
 off in a tug and watch the fun

capstan culbertson

   something about the tone of the
last letter impressed melton as sounding
a note of earnestness to his general
trap foreman the cannery man gave no-
tice that capstan culbertson was threat-
ening to move the trap at no  station
the foreman received the news with a
measure of respect which greatly im-
pressed bill melton

   capstan is playin to the gallery
 said melton senior and might be big
 enough fool to try some dido just to
 make a name for himself take the
 watchman off and leave the trap de-
 serted for a day or two tuesday morn-
 ing station some men on the spit hide
 them in the brush if this young buck
 tries any funny business with that trap
 plug him full of holes im sick of both-
 erin with him

chapter xii

waiting to see

tuesday morning no  was de-
serted  and the scow and trap men
detailed for the purpose speculating on
what capstan intended to do lay hid-
den in the brush

   hes foolin the whole outfit cap-
 stan is declared one of the men rear-
 ing up on his elbow in order to facil-
 itate access to a hip pocket in which he
 carried his plug of sailor capstan
 dont intend to do nothin hes just
 a-layin back and bustin hisself laugh-
 in

   do you know capstan demanded
another reaching for the plug of black
tobacco

   no the owner of the plug of sailor
 did not know capstan except by hear-
 say these here bad men he added
 gratuitously aint never quite as bad
 as they let on if a party will only crowd
 in dost to em and show fight

   oh then you dont know capstan
personal 

   no he did not

   well shut up then just you wait
and see

  maybe now capstan figgers on
bustin up to the trap in a power boat
offered another throwin a line and a
tow hook into the key pile and snakin
the hull works off down sound

  well he cant get away with no play
like that replied the chorus what
do you spose we all would be doin 
no that idee is plumb addle

  three bells as yet no sign of cap-
stan

  from wrangling over what method
capstan was most likely to pursue in the
event that he actually tried to inflict
some damage upon the trap the watch-
ers in the brush fell to pondering what
notion had seized the pirate that he had
expended two bits in the purchase of a
joint of pipe to fit bill meltons stove

  sawlog stevens all-around boom and
towboat man averred profanely that
for one he had never heard the likes
and that in his opinion capstan ought
to have his binnacle examined by a hos-
pital sturgeon

  the apostle a young mail much
given in moments of excitement to im-
pious expression in support of the posi-
tion just taken by mr stevens assev-
erated upon his personal probity and
the reputation of his whole family that
a teredo must have eaten into capstans
skull and let all the sense out

  one fact the discussion made quite
clear  no fish man present had the wild-
est idea of how capstan proposed to rid
himself of the obnoxious presence of
the no  trap

  sawlog stevens hauling forth a pon-
derous silver watch made fast to his
suspender button by a strand of gill net
whispered huskily that it wanted five
minutes of lour bells

  four bells i bet capstan aint fur
off i got a feelin down the marrer
of my spine that capstan aims to come
through

  the band of men waited silently be-
hind the shelter of dense brush each
ready if need be to try a hand grapple
with death and not ashamed that their
hearts beat faster

  suddenly from a rocky point two
hundred yards upshore there rang out
a hearty yo-he-ee-o outlined against


top-notch magazine

the clear blue of the morning sky was
the giant frame of capstan culbertson

  slowly capstan raised his rifle to his
shoulder the glistening barrel de-
scribed part of the arc of a circle as
the marksman centered the tiny white
bead of the front sight truly in the mid-
dle of the shiny joint of stovepipe sur-
mounting the melton watch cabin

  the rifle cracked a terrible dead-
ened sullen roar followed the waters
surrounding the trap parted and piles
web spiller and all disappeared into the
yawning hole which closed as suddenly
flinging the spray and foam a hundred
feet into the air

  for a moment no man of those who
watched behind the bush said aught

  im damned then exclaimed the
apostle

  so be i added sawlog promptly

  capstan went and put a jint of pipe
loaded with dynamite on top of the
watch shack now hes touched her
off with a soft-nosed thirty-eight aint
that just like capstan

chapter xiii

miss proctor loses patience

apstan taking for granted that
his flagrant defiance of law and
order would be accepted by the author-
ities in the same belligerent sense in
which he had made it became after the
blowing up of the fish trap avowedly an
outlaw the fish camp where he had
made his home for years save for hur-
ried nocturnal visitations knew him no
more once or twice when he had
slunk into the darkened cabin of iotte
he had encountered chatla but she al-
ways left the room leaving him to talk
alone with iotte and uncle sky

  iotte never mentioned the name of
capstan to chatla but his figure stoop-
ing with an added burden of disappoint-
ment showed plainly his realization that
his nearest dearest ambition had been
thwarted

  dick and the boston girl came often
to visit chatla once iotte hot with
rage had determined to forbid dick his
house but uncle sky advancing some

potent argument had prevented this
during the increasingly frequent visits
of the young people motitana treated
them with a scrupulous if somewhat
chilly courtesy

  dick sensing the situation to a nicety
at first forbore to mention capstan to
chatla except to praise his desperate
courage and titan strength or to ex-
press regret that his viking spirit re-
fused to abide within the law which in
consequence of his stubbornness was in
duty bound to follow and prosecute
him

  you wouldnt have me shirk my
duty asked dick tentatively when
leading up to the subject of his recent
appointment as a deputy sheriff

  miss proctor standing aside with
uncle sky was listening graciously to
that worthys glowing account of bos-
ton as she was fifty year ago in the
days of the clipper ship

  we dont see things alike chatla
continued dick then with a shade of
tenderness in his voice but some day
we shall i am giving way a lot to
your beliefs more than you can under-
stand  and i am happy in the assurance
that some day you will give me a larger
measure of your friendship and con-
fidence

  chatla sighed deeply and lowered her
glance after a thoughtful minute
straightening her lithe figure she de-
clared proudly

  capstan is of my people i of his i
never will say ill of him or permit any
one else to do so

  i know chatla i honor you for it
never do otherwise than as your con-
science and feelings dictate if you un-
derstand me if i make myself clear
you will know that after all i am
pleading for capstans sake and i am
leading up to this very proposition i
want you to use your influence with
capstan there is yet a chance to ef-
fect a compromise between him and
father

  capstan is gone replied the girl
tersely

  yes yes i understand but i
thought that he surely must communi-
cate with you with your father some-
beyond the law



thing must be done and at once or we
are going out to get him and put him in
jail there is no other way look at
this i feel like the leading man in a
drama of the lurid west dick pulled
aside the lapel of his faultlessly tailored
khaki coat and exhibited his deputy
sheriffs badge quite by accident the
butt of an automatic revolver held upon
his hip in a yellow leather holster ob-
truded itself

  at sight of the badge and this war-
like preparation chatla glanced anx-
iously through the window and up the
trail which led away into the forest
the look was lost upon dick not how-
ever upon miss ada reese proctor

  my job is no picnic continued
dick if capstan is still determined to
hold out i know what i am up against
when it comes to a show-down its a
case of get him or-kill him

  something about her look brought
him to a realization that he was hurting
her frightfully chatla surely i can
make you understand i am not play-
ing the braggart when i say that i will
welcome the conflict if there is to be
one if i should avoid it now that
capstan has made his defiance so
flagrant so insulting way deep down
in your heart chatla you would despise
me

  chatla subtly pleased by dicks ob-
vious regard for her good opinion still
maintained steadfastly that she was of
capstans people and that no man might
count on her to assist in bringing the
giant under the hand of the law

  nodding absently to the prattle with
which uncle sky was regaling her the
boston girl her cold gray eyes alight
with interest took in eagerly every word
that passed between young melton and
lottes daughter

  i cant expect that you will turn
against capstan dick continued
searching his wits for a way to intro-
duce the real intent of his discourse
but i should like to feel that you will
remain neutral that you will not go
unnecessarily out of your way to help
him-or encourage him in his lawless-
ness

  if i did help him she said sar-

castically you would arrest me you
might be able all by yourself

  the derision upon her face the con-
tempt in her voice stung him to an
angry reply i had rather do it peace-
ably  but never fear if force is re-
quired we shall be able to recruit suf-
ficient strength to put this man capstan
as bad as he is behind the bars we
shall not require the aid of-of your
people if the machinery of justice
should prove lacking i can assure you
that capstan has enemies many of
them among the fishermen who might
feel safer if he were in jail such
leadership as capstan has usurped has
not been achieved without leaving many
a smoldering fire of jealousy

  not quite positive that she under-
stood the drift of his argument she still
maintained stoutly that the pirate had
no enemies except the meltons and their
lackeys

  you simply will not understand me
chatla returned dick impatiently i
want to help you and help capstan we
are bound to get him dead or alive if
he holds out against us and i would
enlist your aid in getting him to accept
the liberal compromise which i think
i will be able to offer

  i can make no terms no agreement
for capstan she replied tersely de-
cisively  even papa lotte would not
dare capstan fights his fight alone
he asks no mans help and wants no
mans interference but you said some-
thing of capstans enemies would any
fishman betray him would any be so
foolhardy

  yes now that you have asked di-
rectly when we want mr culbert-
son and start in seriously to get him i
know of one who will lead us to him-
for a consideration

  the quick angry indrawing of her
breath found its echo in the partially
smothered disgusted exclamation ut-
tered by the boston girl

  at this juncture uncle sky ambled
forward briskly if somewhat rheu-
matically and offered to pump the
organ if mister dick would play
rather thankful for a way out of a

painful situation young melton climbed
upon the bench

  miss ada reese proctor of beacon
street boston massachusetts her
spirits not in the least attuned to the
melody of the largo and with a
greater degree of anger showing upon
her classic countenance than had for
many a day there taken up habitat
moved to the door and disappeared
down the trail which led away from the
fish camp into the dense forest a
dozen steps from iottes door and a
sharp turn in the path hid her from the
cluster of cabins here the young
woman stopped lifted her countenance
defiantly to the sentinel pines and
ejaculated the one un-bostonian un-
emersonian word damn

  perhaps-and i dont care-im re-
verting to savagery exclaimed she
half aloud but i think i have retained
a decent sense of fairness if they are
determined to arrest that pirate i
should like to see them do it-on the
square there

  having indulged in one swear word
and a colloquialism miss proctor ex-
culpated her firm but exceedingly win-
some lips by a dab with a bit of lace-
edged linen and resumed her lonely
walk a step or two and she was
brought to an alarmed stop by a vigor-
ous masculine cough which sounded
from the dense foliage right above her
head startled she looked up just as
a great fist protruded and swept aside
the boughs of the tree then followed
the broad face of capstan culbertson

  a moment the two gazed at one an-
other  then the girl recovered her sense
of the proprieties sufficiently to admon-
ish the pirate that no gentleman re-
mained covered in the presence of a
lady

  i know it admitted capstan cheer-
fully but im a-holdin back the branch
with one hand and a-hangin onto a
rifle with the other how kin i 

  certainly the preoccupation of both
of capstans hands constituted an ample
excuse for his seeming ill manners

  will you invited miss proctor
smilingly think it safe to walk a way
with me down the trail

  safe or not capstan was more than
glad to walk presently very much as
a bear descends from honey hunting in
a hollow tree the pirate lowered his
ponderous form to the earth

  there is-somebody began miss
proctor haltingly some fisherman
whom probably you little suspect plan-
ning to give you up to betray you to
the officers

  no

  yes i am quite positive perhaps
this person has made no move has per-
haps only indicated a willingnesss an
ability to put the deputies on your trail
i feel that that is not playing the game
fairly i had a suspicion that you were
lurking along this trail somewhere so i
ventured out to give you a word of
warning no no it is nothing i dis-
like this way of waging war against you
and i do not care particularly if my
little part in the drama does become
known so there she concluded de-
fiantly

  capstan his lips parted half in a
snarl and half a smile his large strong
even teeth gleaming from a glint of
sunshine which pierced the trees slowly
reached forth an enormous paw into
which promptly confidently miss ada
reese proctor laid five tapering fingers

  you come from boston from uncle
skys old stampin ground didnt you
miss ady

  yes boston was her home

  i just had a idee i thinks to my-
self now if some of miss adys women
kin had a-come around the horn fifty
year ago in one of them clipper ships
with uncle sky why your kinfolks
grannydaughter might have done just
what you just done for me just exactly
the way you done it shake again

  still unresisting the slender hand of
miss proctor lay in capstans

  when after while you go back to
boston resumed the pirate and ill
hate to hear that youve went just try
this here little speech on sme of them
scholars  hiyu delate skookum klootch-
manf that there speech is in chinook
its what capstan culbertson thinks
about the girl from boston town and
aint got the crust to say to her in
beyond the law



united states talk if ever you do find
out what it means remember that a
pirate that never jollied nor lied to no
woman said it and meant it shake
hands again miss ady i see why
uncle sky is proud of old boston town
good-by miss ady kla-how-ya

  with a springing step altogether
more exuberant than the gliding am-
bulation of her habitual method of lo-
comotion and repeating to herself the
four softly guttural chinook words
miss ada reese proctor walked joy-
fully back to the cabin of iotte mon-
tana

chapter xiv

tangling tiie web

apstan mounted again to the
vantage point of his perch in the
fir tree and watched while chatla bade
dick and miss proctor good-by at the
boat landing his piercing glance never
left the narcissus while she was in
sight although his muttered comments
dealt solely with his surprise that the
shipwrights had been able so perfectly
to restore the speed boat after the vi-
cious treatment she received the night
of the fight at the hales pass trap

   sliding to the ground the pirate by
an obscure and little-used trail ap-
proached the cluster of cabins when
he had assured himself that no one was
about he emerged from the thicket and
boldly approached iottes house with-
out knocking he opened the door and
entered

   chatla a mingled look of guilt sur-
prise and alarm upon her face put for-
ward a chair and as if he were a total
stranger in the cabin invited him to be
seatecl

   youre dreful perlite chatla must
a-been havin a lot of visitors to prac-
tice on lately

  no she had been rather lonely of
late

  mournin cause ive took to the
bush eh

  avoiding his disconcerting gaze
chatla hastened to assure him that she
was genuinely sorry that circumstances

seemed to demand his absence from the
camp

  the pirate bridling at what he took
for a note of insincerity planted himself
squarely before her and compelled her
to look him in the face

  stow that talk youve been havin
all kinds of good times me bein away
-so fur as youre concerned-aint
worried you thin dont try to put on
no frills a-talkin to me now see here
you had company didnt you just a
minute ago

  chatla drewt her lips firmly together
tossed her head imperiously and started
to brush past the pirate but he reached
out and seized her by the arm

  not so fast not so fast i got a
right to breathe or ast a little question
or two

  you have no right to ask me any
question whatever she returned
whom i entertain in my fathers house
is my own affair let me go please

  chatla i and you aint goin to quar-
rel you aint passed me up so cold yet
have you that i das sent come into the
house and just want to know whos
been here  the giants voice grew
husky he released his hold upon her
and permitted his trembling arm to drop
to his side

  quick to sense the grief in the great
slouching body chatla stepped forward
impulsively and now quite unafraid and
composed assured him that she was
glad to see him and to learn that he
was still safe and sound but that she
had resented his unwarranted brusque
and dictatorial attitude

  it was the way you said it capstan
rather than what you said that offended
me she explained of course i will
tell you who has been here i know
of no reason why i should not mr
melton and miss proctor just spent an
hour with us uncle sky pumped the
organ and we had some music i wish
you could have heard it capstan i
cannot tell you how sublime how mov-
ing it isthat handels largo 

  likely there aint nobody in north
ameriky that can play like dicky bird
was his sneering retort

  the situation again threatening was

restored when chatla gently asked the
pirate to be seated beside her on the
organ bench it will be useless fool-
ish for me to pretend capstan that i
do not understand you you are jeal-
ous and it is foolish- oh so so

foolish of you if it were not so ab-
surd i should not venture to speak of
it at all

  listen to me capstan  miss proctor
and mr melton are-are engaged as
they speak of it over there miss proc-
tor-one can sec it plainly-has no in-
terest in any man but dick he in no
woman except miss proctor i sup- 
pose though neither have told me so
directly that soon they will be married
mr melton comes here never alone any
more but with miss ada when they are
boating both know how lmcle sky and
i enjoy the music

  so dicky bird and miss ady are
pledged 

  yes she had every reason to believe
so miss proctor in fact had prac-
tically said so

  miss ady said the pirate shrewdly
wouldnt turn her hand to save a man
from the gallows less the man hap-
pened to be dicky bird she just natu-
rally cant see nothin in the offing but
dicky bird is that correct

  yes i believe it is

  aint it fine for a girl to be so faith-
ful  i dont spose it would do any
feller no matter who it was any good
to shine up to her

  no it would not miss proctor is
thoroughly wrapped up in dick mel-
ton

  is that so well if miss ady was
a-hikin along in the woods and if some
party purty near a stranger met up
with her by accident-considerin of
course that this party was a spry young
feller-she wouldnt be apt to ask this
party to come on and go a-walkin with
her would she

  no i am positive that she would
not she is absolutely infatuated with
dick melton i dont know the ways
of the people over there but i am a
woman and i know how she feels
toward him miss proctor tells me
that it is well for a girl to hold herself

aloof from all save her affianced lover
and toward him even to be not too ef-
fusive too complaisant it cheapens
one miss ada says

  now is that so returned capstan
sarcastically youve been altogether
too free with me then all these years
pi is jeering tone the insolence in his
face and manner angered her greatly
and she firmly resolved to make no
further attempt to conciliate him until
he was in a different mood

  for a long time both remained silent
chatla realizing that into a feeling of
anger toward the pirate there was creep-
ing an element of disgust capstan
feeling positive that the facts which
had actuated the warning given to him
by miss proctor must be known like-
wise to chatla began clumsily to cross-
examine the girl he hoped that chatla
would seize upon the opportunity to
warn him against the trap being laid
for him

  i spose dicky bird figgcrs that i
aint got a minute to live

  i dont understand what do you
mean 

  i cant figger that dicky bird would
come here into my own wikiup so to
speak without sayin something about
how he aims toketch me or what hes
goin to do with me when he does ketch
me  just wonder if dicky bird knows
what really is goin to happen when i
and him crosses up final

  he spoke very generously of you
capstan he sincerely regrets that it
is going to be necessary to arrest you
unless you agree to quit the pirating
he said it might be fixed up even yet
capstan is there  way

  oh hes a reglar santa claus aint
he hed like to fix it up so he wont
have to arrest me is that it  the idee
that i aim to break his back in seven
places when i lay paw onto him dont
have nothin to do with it

  i believe upon my soul that he has
no fear of you said she rather vain-
gloriously you may see the day when
you will wish you had accepted his of-
fer

  do you think so capstans face
was livid with rage and he clasped and
beyond the law



unclasped his great hands as if already
their sinewy strength was closing down
about young meltons throat did
dicky bird say how he was goin to get
me  he dont plan on rushin in wild-
eyed and slobber-jawed and skin me
alive does he

  instantly the thought occurred to
chatla that capstan relying always
upon his own herculean strength never
imagined that dick might use craft and
not brute strength and courage to effect
his arrest she thought then of dicks
suggestion that a fisherman could be
found who for a price would gladly
betray the pirate she must warn cap-
stan to beware of ill-placed confidences
and had opened her lips to speak when
he said

  you and dicky is sure gettin along
fine dont you wish miss ady would
fall overboard and drown d herself

  with one contemptuous glance
chatla arose from the organ bench
walked haughtily past the pirate and
ascended to her little attic room

  capstan twiddling his great awk-
ward fingers nervously sat looking
blankly about the room he realized
that he had not said one single word
which he had planned to say by his
jealousy and his brutal speech he had
driven her farther and farther away
from him when the purpose of his visit
had been to be gentle kind and consid-
erate

  angrily he turned upon the bench and
cursed the pipe organ symbol to him of
that outer world whose blandishments
in the person of dick melton were
weaning chatla away from him he
feared forever he glared at the in-
strument as if it were some animate
thing responsible for all the woes which
had lately come upon him

  above he could hear chatla pacing
back and forth across her narrow floor
the impulse to call to her to beg her
to come to him and give him one more
opportunity to explain to apologize for

his boorish conduct started the tears in
the giants eyes and he had lifted his
face toward the ceiling to cry out when
across his soul like a fresh cut streaked
the maddening thought that miss proc-
tor a stranger and not chaila had
warned him of the plot against him

  with no anger with naught but grief
deep and unspeakable pictured in his
dejected mien the pirate crossed the
floor opened the door and departed
at his own cabin he rolled up a pair of
blankets filled ids cartridge belt from a
box in a cupboard closed and locked
the door and made for the landing

  chatla heard him when he left the
room below she must tel him that
some one planned to betray him that his
enemies schemed to ensnare him by
guile and trickery but why should she
subject herself to further insult cap-
stan would not in all probability be-
lieve the warning what should she
do one moment hot with resentment
the next tender with a memory of the
days as they used to be her judgment
played shuttlelike bewilderingly back
and forth

  but she must tell him never should
she be able to forgive herself if she
permitted him to go away without tell-
ing him to look out for false friends
down the stair ladder she went and
out upon the trail before the door
away off toward orcas island wa- a
speck upon the water-capstan sculling
his dory

  capstan capstan she cried
wildly

  wind and wave now veering strongly
inland bore back the cry unanswered

ising from the supper table at
haynes excelsior cafe
hifalutin beggs languidly
plucked a battered cane from
the hatrack close by and with
this adornment and his crippled hat in
his left hand sauntered across to the
desk

  my indebtedness he queried in
high-bred tones

  fifteen cents returned the pro-
nounced blonde behind the cash register

  with pleasure mamselle your
ever-obedient servant kisses your hand
no no-dont expostulate oblige me
by keeping the change

  the girl eyed the coins protestingly
  but there isnt any change

  ah is it so then i pray you
forgive the oversight beggs sauntered
out and now he mused to my li-
brary where i may glance over the
great molder of public opinion before
retiring to my downy cot

  he turned into the reading room of
the wallacetown exchange hotel and
settling languidly into the most com-
fortable of the horde of vacant chairs
picked up the wallacetown evening
eclipse his eye indifferently scanned
the headlines one after another and
then suddenly for as much as three
continuous seconds he sat bolt upright

  my my he murmured in shocked
tones then as he eventually collapsed
into a posture of semirepose  to think
of it-my old friend william degray
too bad

  and with a faint touch of real in-
terest he reposefully read an item
couched under impressive headlines

cant raise  is sent to jail
for  days

william degray convicted of disorder-
ly conduct receives exemplary
sentence from his honor

  his honor mused beggs that
sounds just like wallacetown so billy
got into a scrap with a bird named pete
glasscap eh its just like billy to use
his fists  and couldnt raise fifty
bucks to pay his fine thats queer-
decidedly queer he reflected good
chap that same william hes helped
me out of more than one tight corner
looks as though reciprocity were fore-
ordained-provided i have the where-
withal to recipross

  rising he turned his pockets one
after another inside out the in-
ventory totaled two nickels a lincoln
penny and a quarter overweighted with
too large a wad of lead beggs replac-
as you

please



ing the funds in the treasury thought-
fully scratched his head

  now that is too bad-too utterly
bad he muttered guess well see
billy anyway hilliard all right
beggs-but remember-the undertone
grew sharp-when you cant help
financially you mustnt sympathize
sympathy is just charity turned
shoddy

ii

ten minutes later found hilliard b
 beggs seated with chief benja-
min magruder in the latters private
smoking room at the wallacetown po-
lice station where to an obligato played
by the shifting hoofs of the fire-hall
horses on the farther side of the parti-
tion they conversed

  friend of young degray are you
questioned chief magruder well hes
a fine young man

  fifty dollars fine or thirty days
ventured hifalutin

  the chief disappointed tugged
thoughtfully at his scraggly mustache
oh you kin go in and see him he
snorted disgusted at the theft of his
witticism hes right here in the
cooler im going to take him over to
carisford jail on wednesday on the
noon car

  rising he unlocked the heavy cell
door hifalutin ushered into the cell
room by the faint light trickling in
through the dingy barred window be-
held a young man sitting with his head
sunk under his hands the chief re-
tiring closed the door behind him

  i say billy--

  the young man glanced joyously up
at the cheery sound

  a friend at last he yelled glee-
fully

  hifalutin doffing his battered hat
bowed low right you are mr de-
gray this is hilliard b beggs at your
service

  aw slush the young mans tone
was bitter disappointment and the
sunshine fled from his face so theyve
run you in too well it means com-
pany anyway since im dead sure you
havent enough coin to pay your fine

  correct about the funds william
go up to the head of the class hi-
falutin nonchalantly seated himself
upon the bench opposite his cell com-
rade i have just thirty-six cents in-
cluding a plugged quarter also six
nights lodging paid for which consti-
tutes unusual affluence but whats
your trouble anyway  unburden your-
self to an old enemy

  its all pete glasscaps doing burst
forth degray with angry vigor he
trumped up this charge just to tie me
up good and tight for a month

  then you didnt hit pete after all
degrav gazed down at the concrete
floor i hit pete all right a faint
chuckle escaped him you can just
bet i hit him nobody who saw pete
in the witness box would ever dream
of indicting him for perjury but that
was part of his game he met me here
and we had a chat and a drink or two
and the first thing i knew there was an
argument-and you know just where i
land in an argument

  in the other fellows face
  precisely and after that i landed

here and pete glasscap-

  his fist vibrated vengefully

  but why should pete glasscap want
to lock you up i thought you were
friends hifalutins tone was sus-
picious

  cant you understand you mutton-
head  we have a bet on

  a bet 

  thats the real esperanto we were
down at the club one night and pete
offered to bet me a thousand dollars
even that i couldnt beat my wav from
halifax to detroit inside of a month i
started without a cent and the stipula-
tion was that i must not wire home for
money i have to be in detroit by fri-
day noon to win the bet theres a
thousand bucks in it for me if i land
there on time if i dont pete cops
the thousand hes going to leave me
here till he gets the money and then
hell come tooting down with a bunch of
fellows in motor cars to bail me out
and ill have to treat them to a cham-
pagne supper into the bargain

 but why should he-


top-notch magazine

 why why you boob he just
thought i was a bit too near detroit-
thats all hes been haunting me in a
motor car ever since the start and when
he found me here two days walking
from detroit and with six days to
spare he picked a quarrel and-well
i smashed him perfectly fair every
bit of it according to the bet-but pm
out a cool thousand nobody here
knows me the people wont believe my
yarn i cant wire home for funds-
and so im stuck

iii

i see-i see mused hifalutin dreani-
 ily but the saddest part of it is
nobody here knows me either not
that im hampered by that-possibly
im better off but im busted im
stalled and so youve only four days
left to reach detroit pete certainly
was on the safe side when he landed you
for thirty

  hifalutins heart bled for his friend
but his pocket was bloodless had he
possessed fifty dollars he would gladly
have given it he did not possess fifty
dollars his assets consisted solely p
sympathy which was a commodity he
scorned to bestow

  billy he remarked wisely you are
well off right now at one thousand
dollars you bought this lesson on the
bargain counter i congratulate you-i
envy you if i had a temper like yours
id welcome such a lesson a hasty
temper does a man no good particularly

when he hasnt much brains it-

  say what are you trying to do 
  to admonish you billy

  then you just make your exit while
the exiting is good

  hifalutin made his exit on the way
to the cheap lodging house where he
was spending his few days in wallace-
town he pondered the problem had
he been in funds he could have helped
his friend win the thousand dollars he
was not in funds he saw no means of
raising the sum of fifty dollars except
by honest labor and to raise so large a
sum by honest labor would require more
like forty days than four even pro-

vided he lived on nothing which he re-
garded as unlikely it would be a colos-
sal task pie dismissed from his mind
the idea of honest labor the instant it
occured

  my library again he murmured
when after a reposeful night he dis-
missed breakfast from his thoughts and
sauntered across to the hotel pos-
sibly he reflected the morning paper
wrill contain the want ad of a mil-
lionaire desiring to adopt a young and
promising specimen of mankind and
offering a liberal allowance shall we
accept the job hilliard we certainly
shall beggs whats more well wire
our application at once and ask an ad-
vance on the allowance to tide billy
over his present difficulties

  settling himself in a chair he reached
for the most convenient paper as he
did so he became suddenly conscious
that there were others in the reading
room one corner was shut off by a
screen from behind the screen came
the muffled sound of voices above the
hotel clerks desk at the farther end
of the room hung a small mirror and
the mirror dangling at an angle showed
hifalutin the farther side of the
screen a little stout man with a very
ruddy nose was leaning forward in a
chair evidently in anxious converse
with another man but half visible but
whose extreme thinness in the half sec-
tion was very impressive

  but why did you do that snarled
the ruby-nosed man in a voice re-
markably thick and soggy for so early
an hour

  had to rasped his companion
this towns been so stung with sub-
scription fakers that there isnt any
other way i lost three prospects be-
fore i got hep then i put it over right
along and they tumbled great stunt-
merchants bugle regular three dollars
a year for two dollars and you dont
have to pay a cent mr merchant till
the first copy arrives and you know its
all right

  and how the deuce are you going to
get the first copy to them the fat
mans soggy tone was thinned by a
dash of irascibility
as you please



 easy as jumping off brooklyn
bridge i got the girl over there-he
nodded toward the public stenographers
little oftice-to typewrite the list sent
it in to the merchants bugle with a re-
quest to mail sample copies to every
one

  they wont do it

  i typewrote joe gollans name to it
hes their western ontario man that
will fetch them

  and i have to hang around here till

those papers come-

  i have everything timed right to a
second this is tuesday the papers
reach here to-morrow morning you
finish up the small towns to-day and
to-morrow-cut the price all to pieces if
you like but get the cash then come
in here on thursday and collect ill
move on to london and play the game
there

  how- many orders have you
seventy-eight pretty good little
town-eh the thin mans tone was
hearty that means at our cut price
one hundred and fifty-six bucks give
me seventy-eight from the last haul
and take the list

  a right dobson the fat man
counted out the bills and passed them
across to his companion gimme the
orders

  here you are cole and heres a
duplicate of the list i sent to the bugle

iv

ljifalutin ruefully watched the
  currency disappear into the lean
mans wallet a moment later the
lean man vanished from the mirror hi-
falutin dropped his eyes to the news
stand just in time to see dobson cross
his range of vision dobson traversing
the lobby made his exit into the street
a few seconds later the carmine-nosed
cole also crossing hifalutins range of
vision wabbled a trifle unsteadily
toward the bar

  hifalutin leaned forward his atti-
tude one of profound thought al-
ready he had forgotten cole and dob-
son his thoughts were with billy de-

gray who would leave next lay at noon
for a twenty-eight days sojourn in the
county jail at carisford at the
thought he was thrilled with a stoic sort
of gladness that he had not demeaned
himself to the common ordinary level
of offering sympathy where he could
not contribute cash he relinquished
the paper unread and rising hobbled
wearily toward the door as he did
so his quick eye glimpsed something
lying on tfye floor almost at his feet

 my prayers are answered he
breathed

  stooping he picked up a bunch of pa-
pers held together by an elastic band
as he examined them more closely a
disgusted exclamation escaped him in-
stead of the lean mans bills this was
the bunch of subscription orders which
the fat little fellow with the ruby head-
light must have dropped

  hifalutin turned involuntarily toward
the bar halfway he halted pondering
then quietly pocketing the orders he
retraced his steps resuming his ob-
scure seat and his newspaper

  after all cole was a shyster cole
would use these orders if he had them
to defraud each merchant represented
on the list of two dollars of lawful
money in return each merchant would
receive one sample copy of a weekly
trade paper nominally worth ten cents
a few minutes earlier he hilliard b
beggs had mourned his inability handi-
capped as he was by lack of cash to
bestow upon his friend anything
warmer than sympathy here without
a cent of cash he could by the simple
expedient of forgetting to return the
orders do a good turn to each of sev-
enty-eight honest merchants not one of
them less deserving probably than billy
degray

  the little fat man bustled frantically
forth from the bar hifalutin deeply
engrossed in his paper felt his cold
suspicious glance cole wabbled awk-
wardly about the big room colliding
with chairs at every turn his eyes in-
tent upon the floor for a few minutes
he searched behind the screen when
he came forth hifalutin still ensconced
behind his paper in his same old place


top-notch magazine

once more felt the mans curious stare
eventually halting in his wabbly prog-
ress the fat man fumbled in his pocket
and drew forth a paper hifalutin
glancing up saw that he smiled content-
edly

  the duplicate list mused hifalu-
tin  and he knew from the smile of
contentment encircling the carmine
nose that the fat man was mentally
scheming to collect by means of the list
instead of the signed orders

v

ole a trifle relieved wabbled to
the desk eviderftly to report his
loss to the clerk a few minutes later
he returned to the bar hifalutin sat
a while in meditation mourning the
frustration of his plans for doing good
and for preventing the honest mer-
chants from being done in the same
way

  suddenly he started to his feet

  whew he whistled

  for an instant he mentally balanced
chances the sample copies of the
trade paper were due next morning-
wednesday the fat man having
toured the small towns round about
would commence his collection stunt on
thursday

  ill save them yet chuckled hifalu-
tin and-well maybe theyll be so
grateful that theyll lend a helping hand
to billy

  at the post office next morning mr
beggs learned that no letters had ar-
rived for him

  or papers he questioned severely
eying the girl behind the wicket

  no papers

  ah signorina may i trouble you to
look just once more is there not-i
ask it with all humility-at least a copy
of the merchants bugle yearning for
me to take it to my bosom

  there was a whole bunch of bugles
come in this morning but theyre all
distributed replied the girl and
there aint none for you

  hifalutin sighed you could floor
me with a bit of thistledown he mur-
mured

  that was  at  the cheer-
ful vagrant called upon chief magru-
der

  i want to save you that trip to caris--
ford he remarked heres the money
for billy degrays fine

  the chief laid both hands on the
cheerful vagrants shoulders honest
now friend do you think hes worth
it

  honest he isnt but ill pay it just
the same

vi

l-ialf an hour later hifalutin parted

	 from billy degray far beyond the
town limits and safely on the way to
detroit

  thanks a million times old man
bellowed billy as he vanished in a cloud
of dust ill wire that money sure
the minute i cash in on that bet

  at the post office beggs mailed a let-
ter to the bugle then on afterthought
he filed a telegram to the same atldress

  for nearly two days he dwelt in com-
parative luxury at the wallacetown ex-
change on saturday morning he
caught his first glimpse of the previ-
ous nights issue of the evening eclipse
it contained a startling and shocking
announcement

  mr a g p cole representing the
merchants bugle of chicago had been
the victim of a unique swindle mr
cole who was collector for the paper
on making his regular rounds in wal-
lacetown discovered to his surprise that
an impostor had preceded him by a
couple of days and collected from the
merchants upward of one hundred and
fifty dollars on the strength of a bunch
of stolen orders for subscriptions which
doubtless would never be filled mr
cole had wired mr peter j dobson
his fellow representative in the dis-
trict who was in the city trying to
straighten things out

  hifalutin dropped the paper like a
red-hot coal beggs he exclaimed
its time for you to invest what is left
of that money in a railroad ticket
right you are hilliard he added ap-
provingly thats the time you hit
as you please



                                                           i

the nail on the head old boy then
rising in a slightly louder tone the
grips aloysius no-i prefer the open
air these hacks are stifling ill walk
to the depot

  and followed by an imaginary valet
bearing a couple of ghost grips in his
nonexistent hands hifalutin beggs
sauntered rapidly down sydenham
street toward the depot

  halfway he collided with a bunch
of seething vibrant explosive anger
which gripped him by the sleeve

  thats the man hissed a shrill
rasping voice

  hifalutin gently releasing his sleeve
from the determined grip gazed re-
proachfully into the red angry face of
g j watkins hardware merchant ac-
companying watkins was the ruby-
nosed man who gesticulated violently

  have him arrested at once yelled
watkins glancing nervously up and
down street hang that chump
magruder-hes never around when you
want him here mr man you just
come along with me ill escort you
to the cooler

  with pleasure mr watkins mur-
mured hilliard b beggs urbanely
come along mr cole im only too
glad to meet you

  mr cole shrank

  dobson is here isnt he demanded
watkins anxiously

  he went to the station to give the
chief a description of the swindler
faltered cole but-dont you think
mr watkins it might be better if we
settled this thing on the quiet and got
our money back 

  money back growled mr watkins
savagely money back this place
has just been bled white by subscription
swindlers we merchants wouldnt
take a thousand dollars each to settle
this thing nothing but a penitentiary
sentence for him will satisfy us

  they found the tall thin man in
nervous consultation with chief magru-
der at sight of hifalutin beggs
placid countenance he instinctively
drew away

  good morning mr beggs said the
chief genially extending his hand

  beggs eh steals you mean blus-
tered watkins well magruder i
want you to arrest beggs for fraud

  arrest me hifalutins eyes grew
wide for fraud watkins i accept
your apologies right now on the spot-
you can offer them any time youre
ready

  he collected two dollars from me
for a years subscription to the mer-
chants bugle and never turned in the
money hes the swindler you fellows
are after go ahead mr dobson and
lay the information

  i forgive you again mr watkins
there was not a trace of anger in
beggs tone yes and i forgive you
seventy times seven if you persist in
wronging me i did collect the money
whats more i turned in the subscrip-
tions they will be filled i havepaid
the merchants bugle companys draft
to cover the amount less my commis-
sion-here is the draft and here-

  he handed magruder a letter and
with a quick movement blocked the
doorway magruder read aloud

chicago june

    tario

closing list of seventy-eight names of new

preciate your further orders

  as for these men dobson and cole re-
garding whom you telegraphed they are un-
doubtedly impostors we have received com-
plaints regarding them in the past and-

  hilliard standing in the doorway
blocked the wild rush of dobson and
cole for the freedom of the outer world
an instant later magruders hands each
gripped a perspiration-wilted collar

  please dont hurry away gentle-
men he begged the letter goes on
to say he explained that theres a
warrant out for these two birds and
that the companys posted a reward of
fifty dollars for them just tell them

  dobson shook his fist faker he
hissed savagely you never canvassed

hilliard b beggs soothingly was done
unselfishly i merely wanted to help
a very dear friend who was in trouble
and after id helped him unlike you
he turned out honest and delivered the
goods

veritable horse marines
daez who was the first president of the republic of venezuela was perhaps

	the only man who ever fought a naval battle on horseback it is a matter of
history that he to whom more than any other man apart from simon bolivar
venezuela owes her independence actually attacked and captured with his cavalry
a fleet of ships

    bolivar was endeavoring to cross the apure river in the struggle for inde-
pendence but was prevented from doing so by some eight spanish gunboats
which moved up and down the stream as he did bolivar was in despair for a
while to paez who was second in command he appealed for counsel saying
that he could never cross the river so long as the spanish gunboats were there
if only we could capture them the revolutionary leader observed the rest
would be easy

    paez decided that he would have those ships or die and he accordingly
called on his regiment of cowboys to follow him paez himself had been a cowboy
on the plains of the orinoco and was the idol of his men so when he spurred
his horse into the stream calling on his men to follow of the three thousand
cowboys and their mounts which are taught to swim as well as to gallop there
was not a single man to hold out in this unique assault upon the gunboats it
being night the spanish fleet were taken quite unawares the cowboys wriggled
from their saddles to the decks of the vessels letting their mounts swim back
to shore having thus cut off their own retreat it was a question of win or
die they fought well and every gunboat was captured

jlie met her on the crowded shore she said have we not met before and
    soon he was enraptured for she had such taking ways

    he played the role of gallant beau escorted her all oer the show it was
expensive but you know she had such taking ways

    with charming disregard for price he paid for oysters wine and ice and
oh he thought her awfully nice she had such taking ways

    her face to his he gently drew and vowed forever hed be true it broke his
heart to bid adieu she had such taking ways

    but next day gestures quite insane accompanied angry words profane for
she had pinched his watch and chain she had such taking ways

turing one of the principal events at a race meeting the cry of hats off in

    a few minutes later a young man began wildly to lift the hats of the specta-
tors around him replacing them with savage expressions of annoyance on
lifting the hat of one of the spectators he was asked what he wras up to

a hard lesson

          you had inquired of any
member of the big circle that
ibmss sat just outside the ropes in
fsppspt the smoke fog at the old mar-
quis a c once a week as to
the pugilistic worth of one jerry alsop
you would have heard a eulogy-with a
reservation one and all they admitted
that alsop was fast with his fists he
was tricky and entirely capable

  he had an awkward way of bunching
up his left shoulder and dropping his
head behind the hard and bony ram-
part turtlewise more than one zealous
adversary had shattered his knuckles
against that unique defense then too
he would foxily permit himself to be
driven back against the ropes stretch-
ing them taut as a bowstring he would
brace his feet then let go suddenly and
the result was the same as if he had
been flung from a giant sling he would
catapult forward arms swinging with
tremendous momentum with disastrous
consequences to the overconfident
enemy

  add to all this a lightning left jab
a right with the kick of a blunderbus
the footwork of a dancing master and
you have the makings of a champion

  yes jerry alsop looked like very
promising material he was coming
along slowly unostentatiously and was
learning all the time the old marquis
a c where he fought at the regular
thursday-night stags was an independ-
ent organization which wouldnt pay
for space in the newspapers conse-
quently alsop was a strictly local
celebrity

  the marquis a c was a good tough-
ening school it was made up of rough
young artists of the padded glove who
labored hard to earn the meager pay the
club could afford the grizzled referee
permitted no loafing inside the ropes
everybody slaved and performed his
best

  jerry alsop met with reverses and it
is those reverses that this story is chief-
ly about

 alsop copped the post-mortem
championship years ago old patrick
palmer explained disgustedly in the
cryptical language of sport thats
whats the matter with that fellow you
cant beat him for his alibis he splits
straws and hes keen for that moth-
eaten might-have-been stuff nobody
ever fairly outpointed jerry alsop yet
according to his dope why hell en-
tertain you for hours about the raw
deals hes had slipped him he always


top-notch magazine

raises the big holler he always crabs
the other fellows victory by pulling
yards of the baby stuff im sorry for
that kid because hes awful good other-
wise awful awful good do you get
me pal 

  what patrick palmer really meant
was that alsop was a bit selfish and
egotistical if he was beaten he loudly
proclaimed it an accident he was
chary of confessing defeat he
wouldnt bestow credit where it be-
longed jerry wasnt a good-enough
sport ever to be wholly popular

 such a man needed a few hard
knocks to bring the real stuff that was
in him to the surface and he got them
to begin with there was his affair with
that divinity that masqueraded under
the earthly name of barbara slosson it
was his first eye opener

  miss slosson was a woman in all the
name implies she worked in warrens
homemade kandy kitchen eight hours
a day for eight dollars a week con-
trary to all standards of romance she
had no horde of small brothers to buy
shoes for invalid sisters to nurse even-
ings or a shiftless father who beat her
frail mother to support she was quite
a prosaic sort of a girl but jerry
thought her sweeter than all the candy
she peddled over wrarrens counter

  barbara slosson lived happily in a
little hall bedroom under a skylight that
let in the sun and her most valued pos-
session was a chafing dish which helped
to keep down expenses wonderfully
the most exciting thing in her life was
to fool her landladys abnormally de-
veloped sense of smell boarders who
dined in their rooms behind plugged
keyholes were not wholly desirable in
the mercenary eyes of mrs greeley
for the rest miss slosson adored the
turkey trot loftily ignored the cause of
woman suffrage and graciously allowed
the grateful jerry alsop to call on her
in the shabby parlor downstairs every
saturday night

  sunday afternoons they strolled in
the little park opposite mrs greeleys
select boarding place like captive birds
behind the tall rusty palings not that
jerry wanted to escape from this thral-

dom understand that little spot of
green in the heart of the steel and stone
city wras his garden of eden

  she must know that he loved her
and when he got ready to take unto
himself a wife for better for worse-
why he was going to justify her intui-
tion he was supremely confident she
would accept the honor of going
through life the consort of the future
lightweight champion of the world-if
he only could get a square deal there
were times when she walked demurely
beside him actually waiting for him to
speak

  then one day when the birds sang of
spring he told her arrogantly sure of
his ground he took much for granted
as a matter of course he had waited
until his irresistible charms made cap-
ture easy he spoke importantly of the
future of the ultimate confusion of the
mighty lightweight champion of the
money he would make he spoke of
other things at glittering length she
would ride in automobiles and wear dia-
monds if she married him he bragged
but that was before he asked her point-
blank for her opinion about it unfor-
tunately

  jerry she said a bit hysterically
youre too fresh for your age you
act as if i belonged to you already and
believe me youre no king conferring
a favor upon a humble subject thats
not me at all i dont like your swag-
ger

  he looked aggrieved but you must
care for me some

  womanlike she temporized that
isnt what we must settle between us-
just yet she said sharply frowning
to conceal her real feelings in the mat-
ter jerry youre not making good
in your calling somehow you want
all the plums and when somebody takes
one from you you begin to yell for
mamma harry harrigans given it a
name he calls you alibi alsop 

  harrigan hey he cried with in-
stant jealousy whats that fresh
young cub reporter to you anyway
bab

  nothing except that i admire the
clever stuff he does for the clarion
the way of it



call she countered just as quickly
hes picked out your weak spot jerry
and its making you sore i cant over-
look the way you excuse your every
failure to make good jerry im a girl
that thinks a whole lot about the future
perhaps more than is good for my
peace of mind the real men dont
waste time in vain regrets go forth
everlastingly keep plugging to deliver
the goods and forget the spilled milk
that ought to be your motto

  but instead of spurring him on her
words only made him fume and fret
i could have got you if that sneak har-
rigan hadnt come butting in where he
wasnt welcome he wailed the
breaks never did string along with me
for two minutes at a stretch anyway i
always have rotten luck

  jerry please stop she pleaded lay-
ing a tremulous hand on his shoulder
im not quite equal to hear much of
that kind of talk from-from you just
now as things stand she smiled up
at him wanly its the first time ive
heard it from your own lips you see
and it-it hurts

  eagerly he clutched at that unex-
pected tone of interest well im no
quitter anyway bab he cried im-
pulsively well waive all the rest of
it little girl just tell me what ive
got to do to get the decision from you
thats much better jerry she said
gently dont you honestly think so
yourself  listen to the sound of it
and compare it with the howl you raised
a minute ago sometimes i have strong
hopes for you that youll work out your
salvation the real blown-in-the-glass
articles there all right if you only
dont choke it to death

  what have i got to do lie repeated
doggedly in a tone that made bab slos-
sons heart glad

  she looked him straight in the eye
and issued her ultimatum youve got
to take your beatings without a whimper
hereafter thats all

  and what if i do he persisted im-
petuously feeling that no sacrifice was
too great to have and to hold such as
she suppose i do muzzle this un-
ruly tongue of mine and let the other

fellow rub it in with never a come-
back  what happens next 

  youll learn to be a good loser
jerry she answered enigmatically

  but that isnt what i mean bab
he said bluntly what i want to hear
you say is that youll marry me if i
learn to keep mum when the goirlgs
poor thats what ive got to know be-
fore i go ahead with this thing youre
asking

  perhaps i will she returned still
evasively but jerry youve got to
learn something else youve got to
learn to take your chances but ill
promise this much-no more you come
to me again then and if im still in the

market- she blushed rosily and

concluded hastily go away you big
overgrown boy 

  thats promise enough bab he
said thickly between his teeth striving
to make this his first lesson in the manly
art of self-suppression

chapter ii

when it happened

ide it entered on the credit side of
jerry alsops ledger of life that
he did his best from that time forth
he returned to the profession that took
him inside the ropes grim-mouthed
well-nigh taciturn he mounted the
sporting ladder slowly surely and be-
gan to cast sheep s eyes at the light-
weight crown itself but he set less
value upon these things now at times
he almost wished morbidly wistfully
that he would lose some important bout
on the veriest fluke then and not un-
til then he would be able to prove to
bab slosson that he had come to think
as she wanted him to think bout some
things but it seems that the gods of
the glove game were in whimsical hu-
mor he had always been a good win-
ner no one had ever found fault with
his conduct as long as things went his
way and he had forgotten how to
lose apparently

  once he even conceived the wild idea
of deliberately quitting but to this
there were many drawbacks for one
thing it wasnt fair to his manager


top-notch magazine

that little man had bargained shrewdly
jockeyed adroitlyto land jerry on the
top of the lightweight heap he de-
served the fruits of victory then too
jerry didnt want to get anything un-
der false pretenses she wouldnt ap-
prove and he would ever after be
ashamed to look at himself in the glass
if he tried to frame anything up on a
girl like barbara slosson

  but one afternoon in an open-air
arena made of pine boards and pitched
on the outskirts of a certain desert town
not so very far from nevada he met
the snag he had been secretly praying to
run up against of course the chim-
panzee didnt know anything about the
aspirants promise to a girl back east
who had quixotic ideas as to what her
husband must be all the champion
knew that day was that this jerry al-
sop was a dangerous rival who must
be eliminated the challenger through
the medium of his manager had dogged
him fretted him out of all patience for
a year

  the chimpanzee was cast in no sym-
metrical lines of classic beauty his
arms were too long for his trunk he
was bow-legged and red bristles of hair
stood up from his cone-shaped dome of
meager thought like pins in a cushion
his face was fearful to behold the
features had been kneaded and pum-
meled by the gloves of over a hundred
boxers

  he was a fighter from his canvas
shoes up even if he wasnt good to
look upon

  in the early rounds jerry alsop took
up the work where the former crude
sculptors had left off he didnt ex-
actly give the chimpanzee a new nose
but he materially changed the shape of
the one he had then he artistically
closed the left eye

  every time the chimpanzee was hit
he grunted phlegmatically he took
punishment as a sponge takes water
but his bright vicious little eyes never
overlooked an opening and alsop nar-
rowly side-stepped many a hard blow
that made his hair flutter

  just wait until chip connects with
one of those roundhouse rights loudly

prophesied the ring sharps lined up just
back of the industriously scribbling
newspaper men this jerry alsops a
nice little boy but its the sleeper out
of town for his good night

  harry harrigan let his pencil fly over
the copy paper making hen tracks and
talked to the telegrapher at his side out
of the corner of his mouth he hoped
for reasons strictly his own business for
a while that the kill-joys in the rear
were calling the proper turn he
wanted to see alsop done to a delectable
brown but he felt dubious in his ex-
perts heart the old dope might go
askew to-day the bout was limited to
twenty rounds the champion had been
foxed into agreeing to that stipulation

  the chimpanzee growled like a bear
stung by bees under jerrys light taps
however the challenger was piling up a
big lead on points what if the cham-
pion failed to land one of his justly
famous knock-outs alsop was side-
stepping and getting away beautifully
the passing of every round saw harry
harrigan grow more and more restive
uneasy

  sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen
twenty the crowd stood up for the
twentieth round edging toward the ex-
its shouting excitedly another three
minutes safely weathered would see a
new lightweight champion acclaimed

  alsop came out of his corner step-
ping warily he could almost feel the
referee raising his glove aloft his ears
attuned to the bedlam to follow but
he didnt care much bab slosson was
just as remote as on that day when she
had sent him forth to learn to lose like
a gentleman then it happened

  all afternoon the sun had been hid-
den behind a solid canopy of gray
now at sunset the curtain in the west
had rolled up like a scroll leaving a
narrow strip of lemon-tinted sky near
the horizon when alsop left his east-
ern corner the orb of day dropped
squarely beneath that ragged lower edge
of clouds like a diving plummet the
resulting sudden glare dazzled his eyes
momentarily made him squint blinded
he could no longer make out the chim-
panzee he lifted his gloves with a
i

the way of it



pathetically helpless futile motion by
instinct alone he felt the avalanche ap-
proaching then the daylight was blot-
ted out and it was all over for jerry al-
sop challenger

chapter iii

the wrong turn

in his dressing room alsop waited ex-
pectantly for the reporters peace in
his soul he knew what to say to them
nor did he look like a man who had
just lost a worlds title by an eyelash
that was because the greater triumph
would be his once he got the ear of the
gentlemen of the press

  he went briskly about his dressing
whistling an old-time melody reminis-
cently bab slosson had liked that
song there wrould be no struggle he
would think of her approbation and say
his little piece he would give the
chimpanzee all the credit in the coming
interview

  but the sporting writers were still
busy at the ringside wiring all over the
country the details of that brief sensa-
tional twentieth round jerry began to
fidget nervously could it be that this
championship bout was going to become
ring history without a statement from
the defeated boxer it would be just
his luck if they had forgotten all about
him but he bit his tongue on that he
was done with talking about his luck

  on the short walk to the curb where
a throbbing auto waited to take him
away however harry harrigan but-
tonholed him alsops dapper little
manager was going before forcing a
path from the dressing-room entrance to
the machine through the gaping crowd
jerry was next in line his face court-
plastered staring stoically straight
ahead after the manner of the great of
earth behind him filed the solemn
coterie of seconds

  it was a grim little party that came
from out the shadow of the high board
fence that girdled the now empty arena
but harrigan braved the snarls of high-
strung disappointed men and plucked at
the sleeve of the disappointed chal-

lenger the crowd craned necks curi-
ously but could hear nothing jerry
stepped obligingly aside

  youve got something fto say about
that lucky blow alsop prompted the
young reporter under his breath i
can see it sticking out all over you
jerry heaved a vast sigh of relief
of course he said as a mere mat-
ter of routing that chimpanzee won
to-day because he had the heaviest
punch that clip he fetched me on the
chin in the last round was a beauty
hes the best man at the weight in the
world and i heartily congratulate him
i hope when i learn a little more about
the game that hell give me another
chance at the title thats all im say-
ing for publication print that in your
paper harrigan want a lift as far
as the station

  and jerry alsop heaved another sigh
of relief now that it was said beyoid
all recall he was making good to his
best girl this time

  the sporting writer cleverly con-
cealed his own disappointment but
the sun blinded you he objected tenta-
tively you couldnt have seen the
champion coming at you with smoked
glasses that knock-out was purely ac-
cidental alsop

  but jerry only smiled his skepticism
nothing doing harrigan im through
with all alibis we cant take anything
away from the cnimpanzee he ought
to get all thats coming to him for stand-
ing up under punishment the way he
did and sending over the big wallop at
the last are you coming with us
n-n-no said harry watching the
hurried approach of other reporters
bent on getting an exclusive interview
with jerry alsop  that last obliterat-
ing blow the word had been passed
that the beaten contestant was leaving
the inclosure

  alsop went on to the waiting ma-
chine as if walking on air he even
winked at his dapper little manager
who was nursing a black mood and a
black cigar as he climbed cheerfully
aboard in the morning barbara slos-
son would be reading with glowing
cheeks what he had to say


top-notch magazine

  he took a world of conscious pride
in that utterance he couldnt have
done better had she herself dictated it
to him he was a little sorry he hadnt
waited to say the same thing substan-
tially to the rest of the newspaper boys
but he was in a generous humor let
harry harrigan derive the benefit from
the scoop he had just engineered

  he glanced back some of the be-
lated news mongers were giving frantic
chase he waved his hand in airy fare-
well the crowd was eddying fanning
out into the street trudging home in the
gloom the last chapter of the recent
unpleasantness with the chimpanzee
had been written

  but there was an epilogue jerry
alsop didnt get wind of it until he
reached home and bought up the news-
papers of a date immediately follow-
ing that on which the lightweight cham-
pionship had been successfully defended
by the narrowest of margins the
young boxer lacked those accounts to
complete his highly prized scrapbook to
date as soon as he verified the mo-
mentous interview with harrigan he
meant to go to bab slosson with the
clipping in his pocket that little strip
of proof would guard him beyond all
fear of contradiction

  he opened to the sporting page in
pleased anticipation of what he was to
read the rustle of the paper sounded
good to him he wras about to see
his vindication set forth to the world
in never-fading type the background
would yellow with age but the blessed
words would still be there brave manly
words that he would never read with-
out a glow of suffusing satisfaction
why he would get bab to have them
framed and hung in their parlor in a
place of honor

  the next second his eyes opened at
least half again as big there was the
interview boxed off in a little space of
its own at the top of the split column
but poor jerry alsop didnt recognize
a single word of it it was shockingly
inaccurate a libel on his regeneration
harry harrigan had basely put words
into his mouth that wild horses couldnt
have dragged from him it was pre-

cisely like the stories he had pulled in
the old days

  he flung the paper from him in dis-
gust he rather thought he had a word
to say to this presumptuous reporter
who could lie about him so glibly but
that grudge could wait first of all he
must explain to his girl about this ter-
rible mistake

  miss slosson came into the shabby
little front parlor at mrs greeleys se-
lect boarding place interrogatively do
you want to see me about anything
jerry she inquired kindly with just
a touch of listlessness that escaped
him

  he had been waiting impatiently on
the edge of a musty sofa worrying his
cap with twitching fingers you bet i
do bab he cried quickly leaping to
his feet ive just got wise to what
the papers said about me after the
chimpanzee  slammed me cold and i
want to tell you its an outrage the way
ive been misquoted that friend of
yours harry harrigan has got his
harpoon all sharpened for me i never
said a word of it bab i-

  suddenly he stopped his tirade
mouth agape the girl didnt seem to
be listening

  what whats the matter little girl
he gasped in surprise dont you be-
lieve im spinning you the straight
stuff

  oh i dont know i dont know
jerry why do you bother me with
such things  she had broken down
and was sobbing in her handkerchief
unrestrainedly jerry jerry dont
you wont you cant you ever under-
stand the same old old excuses i
despise so youre offering xne now only
theyre dressed differently to-to fool
me

  but this isnt an excuse at all he
protested wonderingly ive been
slandered

  barbara slosson dabbed at her eyes
unconvinced and you run to me with
your troubles like a cry-baby neverthe-
less  jerry you may be absolutely in
the right of it this time but please
please see what a spectacle youre mak-
ing of yourself why im not quite
the way of it



sure that this isnt the very worst be-
havior youve shown if harry har-
rigans been printing mean things about
you you should go to him not me you
dont want to hide behind my apron
strings do you jerry make him re-
tract apologize

  im sorry he said in an altered
voice very humbly bab im begin-
ning to get the whole of your point of
view im learning all the time the
next thing im going to do is to but-
ton my coat and hustle around to the
clarion call office sporting department
youve tipped me off swell i know my
little book hereafter you bet

chapter iv

by way ok reprisal

ierry alsop was as good as his
j boast but it was the wrrong time of
day to catch a reporter at his desk
harrigan was somewhere up in darkest
harlem innocently asleep the aven-
ger got the location of the flat down pat
and went intrepidly uptown

  he rang the bell in the vestibule many
times and the door failed to click but
jerry wasnt disheartened he routed
out the janitors wife and together they
marched up the stairs there followed
a prolonged pounding on the young re-
porters hall door the buxom queen
of the dumb-waiter domain explained
superficially that the young gentleman
avas a sound sleeper but at last a
drowsy hail sounded from within and a
shuffling step came along the hall

  the door opened a crack into which
alsop thoughtfully inserted his boot
harrigan eyes full of morning glories
peered forth and yawned rudely in his
callers face then he greeted the
young boxer he had maligned perfunc-
torily and the door opened wider evi-
dently he was no coward jerry saw
he was dressed only in pajamas and a
pair of flapping carpet slippers

  ive got to see you harrigan he
announced with a certain grimness that
couldnt very well be lost on the other

  harrigan blinked foolishly like a man
barely awake all right he said not

very cordially youre looking right
at me

  cut that out said alsop irritably
pushing his way determindedly toward
the interior of the room uninvited
you know what i mean harrigan
i want you to take back something you
wrote about me

  the reporter frowned something
i wrote about you  he repeated mus-
ingly as if trying to recollect the really
trivial matter youll have to be more
explicit ive forgotten

  harrigan youre lying accused
jerry bluntly then you wont take
it back i suppose 

  the cornered sporting writer tem-
porized why should i alsop that
little difference of opinion out west is
stale news by now the public wouldnt
be interested in a brand-new post-
mortem from you even if i had pull
enough to jolly the old man into giving
me space for it you see its all too an-
cient for a live sporting page like ours
to handle im sorry but you ought to
have come sooner i might have been
able to fix you up last week

  with difficulty jerry alsop held him-
self physically in check say he said
suspiciously whats eating you any-
way  are you stuck on barbara slos-
son yourself 

  oh shes a nice little girl con-
fessed harry banteringly shes still
eligible to the matrimonial stakes if we
care to take her word for it too im
not saying for sure alsop but i might
be coaxed into doing something foolish
what do you think of doing about it
jerry alsop was fighting another sort
of a battle for self-mastery now
why nothing much he said in a
strange choked sort of a voice har-
rigan i dont intend doing anything this
minute except to borrow the coat of
those pajamas youre wearing if youll
lend it to me

  whats this nonsense

  ill explain in a minute the aroused
young boxer promised queerly id
prefer a rope but you havent got one
handy probably harrigan i just want
to tie one hand behind my back for a
little while i want to take something


top-notch magazine

out of your hide it wouldnt be fair
in me to thrash a novice like you with
both hands it will even up the odds
considerably to do the job wtith one
would you oblige by tying the knot

  harrigan flushed then paled ill
call your bluff he shouted back shak-
ingly youd better let me fasten your
feet too that would provide you with
one of your magnificent excuses be-
cause alsop there isnt a man in the
world of my inches who can beat me up
with one hand in a rough-and-tumble
come on you little mucker and dont
forget im about twenty pounds
heavier

 jerry said nothing more that
tongue of his had got him into a peck
of misunderstanding with the girl he
loved already the preparations for the
handicap grudge bout went on apace
the enraged sporting writer tremblingly
divested himself of the upper portion
of his pajamas viciously he knotted it
around the professional boxers slim
waist rendering his mighty right arm
rigid useless then the furniture of
the dining room was shoved against the
wall and they went at it uncompromis-
ingly

  harry harrigan was a bachelor so
there were no tearfully hysterical rela-
tives to interrupt the festivities the
young sporting writer opened the ball by
attempting to rush his experienced an-
tagonist off his feet but jerry used
his free arm as an expert fencer wields
his rapier with catlike agility he par-
ried and jabbed

  harrigan was thrown into confusion
by the precision of those tapping blow s
at times he would have made affidavit
that alsop had a dozen hands working
for him

  the one arm that jerry elected to
bring into play did triple quadruple
duty harrigans face was soon sliced
raw by the professional boxers hard
knuckles it was pitiful

  at last harry staggering weak help-
less longer to defend himself cried quits
through thick and swollen lips he tot-
tered feebly to a chair and slumped into
it groaning the chastened reporter
sadly watched the capable avenger of

his honor unknot his bonds and toss the
wrinkled pajama coat across the room
to him

  harry fumbled in the breast pocket
and extracted a much-needed handker-
chief which he held to his bleeding
nose jerry alsop followed the pa-
jamas across the room and stood star-
ing down at his handiwork thoughtfully

  harrigan he blurted unexpectedly
as if he had determined upon some-
thing suddenly are you going around
to see bab slosson soon

  yes replied the other defiantly
you cant bully me into staying away 

  alsop nodded as if pleased i sup-
pose if i gave you a little note to de-
liver to her youd throw it into the
first convenient wastebasket wouldnt
you 

  perhaps

  all the same harrigan im going to
take a chance on your sheer cussecl-
ness declared the victor lightly it
really doesnt matter if you deliver the
message or not i can easily send a
duplicate through the mail so you see
you wont gain anything by acting badly
about it youll pardon me for a mo-
ment 

  with exaggerated politeness he drew
forth a memorandum tablet and pencil
and wrote swiftly on his knee he read
over the note with great relish and
carefully folded it from another
pocket he fished an envelope none too
immaculate it was the task of only a
second to address it insert the briefly
scribbled communication and seal it

  the note was without formal begin-
ning or end it read as follows

  he couldnt prove an alibi so im return-
ing him to you herewith slightly damaged
its up to you bab whether this sort of a
guy ought to have the can tied to him or
not im not saying a word any more not a
word	j a

  jerry laid his letter on the table and
left the flat without more ado for a
long rambling walk it made him hot
and cold with apprehension to think
that a fine girl like bab slosson might
hitch herself to a four-flusher like this
harry harrigan but he couldnt quite
see what more he could do to prevent
the way of it



such a catastrophe this trailing a skirt
was a one-sided game she always had
the privilege of changing her mind
jerry sighed plaintively from sheer dis-
illusionment if women only would
act sensible rather than from impulse
there would be some getting along with
the difficult things

chapter v

another frame-up

the lightweight passed three restless
days and sleepless nights in wait-
ing no word from his very best girl
arrived the dapper little manager
came to him enthusiastic about plans
for a whirl in vaudeville but the har-
assed jerry meant to stick to the city
like a leech until he heard-something

  he evolved the cunning plan of saun-
tering daily around to warrens home-
made kandy kitchen and basely pur-
chasing great boxes of sweets for a
mythical rival for his manly affections
then too she might drop him a word
of encouragement but he abandoned
the threadbare ruse if she cared for
him at all it might make her unhappy
and he would have cut his hand off at
the wrrist any day if that sacrifice would
prevent her crying about him-or any-
body else

  and one day he thought for a mo-
ment that he was rewarded for his pa-
tience boldly she ventured to his home
to see him unbidden jerry alsop lived
in a flat that he shared with his man-
ager that smart little man was absent
at the time no doubt tearfully bewail-
ing his proteges inexplicable obsti-
nacy in hanging around the big town
when the fabled goose was laying the
golden eggs oft there in the provinces

  jerry took no interest in the servant
problem so he opened the door himself
she stood in the dark hall hesitatingly
waiting for his welcome a half smile
forming on her pretty lips

  behind her hovered a shadow of male
proportions jerry thought this per-
sonage looked very much as if he
wanted to bolt down the stairs it was
none other than harry harrigan she
a

 had in tow that was alsops first sur-
 prise but more were coming

   why hello bab i he cried some-
 what lamely his heart thumping like a
 steel riveter what are you doing
 around this part of the world 

   looking for you she said with a
 sort of odd restraint which he couldnt
 fathom if youll invite us in ill ex-
 plain quickly weve got to catch a
 train in an hour from now-for ni-
 agara falls-our parlor-ear seats are
 engaged

   alsop was mumbling apologies for
 his rudeness and clumsily stepping
 aside she swept past him with lowered
 head harrigan behind her was lug-
 ging a suit case he glanced furtively
 at jerry as he passed along the hall but
 that wretched young man was shrewdly
 guessing the worst

   he had been afraid of this all along
 niagara falls had a honeymoon sound
 he didnt like and both of them surely
 had the hangdog air of a couple of
 elopers that ominous suit case was
 corroborating evidence enough

   he piloted them awkwardly into the
 front room which did duty as a parlor
 man fashion his world of bright prom-
 ise going black before his eyes for a
 second they all stood foolishly about
 searching for words that would relieve
 the tension

   the girl took it upon herself to ex-
 plain and her first words confirmed his
 fears

   jerry she began nervously ive
 stopped here to ask you if youd mind
 returning my-my letters and things-
 the autograph picture i gave you and
 that silver locket its only fair to
 harry that you shouldnt keep them
 you know

   poor alsop was licking his dry lips
 and thinking resentfully that she might
 have spared him this humiliation but
 his pride cam to his rescue as pride
 will in times of stress and he bowed
 ceremoniously

   ill get them for you he said
 coolly turning on his heel to comply

   then he thought of something he was
 overlooking and stopped in his tracks

six months before he never would have
thought of it slowly he came back
neither of the other two ever knew
what that little trip across that stretch
of carpet cost him but he went straight
over to harry harrigan hand out-
stretched palm open smiling as bravely
as he could

  congratulations old man he said
with his voice as steady as a rock this
has got to make us bury the past the
little girl wouldnt want us to be ene-
mies after this its her happiness weve
got to consider first-both of us

  then the very heavens fell the much-
advertised crack of doom sounded and
a veritable bolt from the blue almost
laid jerry alsop low he heard a de-
lighted little gurgle from a quarter in
which he hadnt dared look and before
he could dodge a warm palpitating lit-
tle body was nestling close to him

  barbara slosson was crying laugh-
ing and babbling wildly on his manly
shoulder jerry petted her foolishly
and strove to emerge from the chaotic
impossibility of it all harrigan had
sheepishly withdrawn to what the ring
sharps would have called a neutral cor-
ner and he looked upon the scene grin-
ning rather sadly alsop wondered how
he could lose a wife without complaint

  but the girl was explaining that
phenomenon hurriedly jerry jerry
look at me dear she commanded ex-
citedly shaking him tenderly out of his
trance that bully speech of yours
just now sounded good to your girls
ears and i am your girl too if youll
have me ill marry you jerry if
youre really sure you still want me ill
jump at the chance to get you

  but-but harrigan over there-he
might object protested alsop seeing

visions of the woman he loved being ar-
rested for bigamy well have to-er
-buy him off

  she laughed happily at his obtuse-
ness and tweaked his ear playfully
wake up jerry dear she cried
cant you see the joke we never
said we were married we only just
spoke of going to niagara falls-we
had no idea of doing so

  oh look here ill tell you all about
it said harry harrigan suddenly
im the goat you win with bells on
alsop i  wanted bab just as bad as
you do and-well i did my best to put
you in wrong alsop bab always cared
the most for you and after you beat
me up she liked you better

  oh not because jerry licked you
harry protested the girl

  no thats right admitted harri-
gan but she decided you were a man
after all well she agreed to give me
one more chance she said if id make
out we were married and come over
here and put it up to you shed take
me in case you acted like a yellow pup
you win  thats all

  well theres no yellow pup about
you either harrigan said terry in a
burst of joyous good-fellowship i-
im sorry i beat you up the way i did
the girl blushing rosily turned to
harrigan thank you harry she
said prettily well never forget what
youve done and now i think mr al-
sop has something to say to me in pri-
vate would you mind leaving us for
a few minutes 

  i get you said harrigan amiably
you dont have to tell me how many
it takes to make a crowd say alsop
if youre short of a best man just look
me up always glad to oblige

it was his first visit to america and he was anxious to see as much of it as

    the old man looked at him half sadly half sheepishly shook his woolly
head and said

the conundrum

r rudolph gallatin
was a conundrum to walla
walla he looked like a col-
lege professor he dressed
like the advance agent of a
three-ring circus he talked and de-
ported himself like a new york drum-
mer that he was none of these cer-
tain inquisitive elements of the popula-
tion had fully decided but just what he
was nobody had been able to ascertain
although lie had been in town a week

  even at chris yvahmans high class
tonsorial parlor in main street where
he had been coming regularly every
morning to be shaved gallatin was still
a mystery chris held the worlds
championship for minding other peo-
ples business but thus far all he had
succecdcd in finding out about the gayly
dressed breezy stranger with the lofty
forehead and the dreamy eyes was that
he had a two-dollar room with bath at
the dacres hotel was a liberal spender
hailed from new york city and had
never been in the northwest before

  the very first morning gallatin had
dropped into the barber shop chris

while applying the lather had pro-
ceeded to cross-examine him

  stranger in town he began tenta-
tively

  i am was the laconic response
only once over please and go easy
ive got a tender skin

  how do you find it the proprietor
of the high class inquired as he laid
aside the brush and began to scrape

  a little dull groaned the man with
the tender epidermis

  i wasnt referring to the razor said
chris stepping back to strop the steel
as he spoke i was asking you what
you think of walla walla

  greatexclaimed the man in the
chair enthusiastically i d-nt won-
der that they call it the garden city it
deserves the name

  maybe youre thinking of settling
here 

 maybe i am i might do much
worse i think

  you couldnt do much better sir
chris declared warmly this is a
wonderful country we are the center
of the most fertile section of the rich
northwest our climate cant be beat
our wheat and alfalfa crops are truly
phenomenal our agricultural horti-


top-notch magazine

cultural dairy and poultry resources
are simply marvelous and the best
part of it is that the development of this
section is still in its infancy the rich
soil of the walla walla valley hasnt
yet been made to give up more than a
tiny fraction of what its capable of
yielding no sir take it from me you
wont be making any mistake if you de-
cide to locate here chris had been
flourishing his razor oratorically as he
spoke now he remarked more
quietly but maybe youre not inter-
ested in the agricultural possibilities of
this section sir

  do i look like a farmer asked mr
rudolph gallatin with a smile

  no you dont from your appear-
ance i should say you were a pro-
fessional man maybe a lawyer an
osteopath or an actor

  gallatin laughed you flatter me
he said noncommittally

  but then appearances are often de-
ceptive the inquisitive barber per-
sisted it really wouldnt surprise me
at all sir if yoit were to tell me that
you are in some commercial line

  very true the other agreed as
you suggest a man might look like a
lawyer or a physician and still be a
soap salesman

  ah so you sell soap

  i oh no indeed i merely cited
that as an illustration

  might i ask what you do sell

  i havent said that i sell anything
observed gallatin with an exasperating
smile

  undaunted by these evasions chris
stuck manfully to his guns for six
successive days he kept on probing his
mysterious customer but found to his
chagrin that the latter was too much
for him on all other subjects mr ru-
dolph gallatin was talkative enough but
whenever the conversation was directed
toward his personal affairs he became
about as loquacious as a clam chris
was about ready to give up in despair
when his pretty niece came back from
a two weeks vacation at bingham
springs to resume her duties as mani-
curist at the high class tonsorial par-
lor

  as soon as the mysterious customer
set eyes on the fair wielder of the
orange stick and cuticle shears he de-
cided that his hands needed attention
and then the conundrum was solved
before she had finished trimming his
finger nails mr rudolph gallatin had
imparted to her the secret which for a
week had baffled her uncle and many
other curious inhabitants of the garden
city

chapter ii

iiis startling announcement

j all ati n was much impressed
wdth the charms of chris pretty
niece and lost no time in telling her so

  do you know he remarked as she
lifted his right hand and gently ran a
slender file across the edge of the thumb
nail ive just discovered that ive
made a tremendous mistake

  flows that

  since my arrival in this bully town
ive been telling myself that the azure
skies of the walla walla valley were
the most glorious shade of blue in the
whole wide world for that i owe you
an apology

  i dont quite understand said the
girl with a frown

  i have unintentionally slighted your
eyes he explained they are a much
more glorious blue believe me little
one i have never seen-ouch

  the ejaculation was an expression of
physical pain the sharp point of the
nail file had suddenly entered the flesh
of his thumb

  oh i beg your pardon cried the
girl a twinkle in the blue orbs which
had just received such a glowing
tribute it was awfully careless of
me but then i always get nervous
when strangers call me little one and
pay me such extravagant compliments
gallatin sucking his thumb looked
at her approvingly youre all right
he declared i deserved that jab for
getting fresh ill be careful not to of-
fend again

  i hope so she said demurely as
she spoke she glanced toward the bar-
ber at the second chair a good-looking
winged in walla walla



young man whose face was at that
moment disfigured by a scowl

  this young barbers name was larry
bradley he had been working for
chris wahman about twelve months
and there were few of the regular
patrons of the place who did not know
that he was in love with the boss niece
and hoped to marry her-as soon as he
had saved up enough money to quit the
barber trade-which he hated-and buy
a chicken ranch in the vicinity of walla
walla

  as larrys chair was situated close
to the operating table of the manicure
girl he had overheard what gallatin
had said to her hence the fierce scowl
upon his handsome face and in addi-
tion to the scowl his right hand shook
so that only a miracle it seemed saved
the man whom he was shaving from
losing his off ear

  would i get another stab if i were
to make so bold as to ask what your
name is gallatin inquired of the girl
honestly im not getting gay again
im dead anxious to know

  the girl shrugged her shoulders
well ive no great objection to telling
you its not exactly a secret im
spokane wahman chris is my uncle
spokane  how very extraordinary 
that isnt a girls name its the name
of a city

  it happens to be my name the girl
said tartly im sorry if you dont
like it perhaps my parents made a
mistake in not consulting you before i
was christened

  no they didnt he protested with
a laugh it is a very pretty name i
was merely remarking as to its oddity
well miss spokane wahman i hope
that you and i are going to be the best
of friends i intend to be one of your
regular customers but i sincerely hope
that our acquaintance is going to be
more than a mere business one

  at which sally the scowl upon larry
bradleys face deepened and once more
an ear of the customer he was shaving
narrowly escaped amputation

  are you thinking of locating here
the girl asked her tone sounded flat-
teringly eager in point of fact her in-

terest was quite impersonal but he
did not know that all natives of walla
walla male and female are loyal root-
ers for their city and state that they
are always delighted to hear of newr
settlers

  yes i hope to remain here galla-
tin informed her i like the town and
i like the people i have decided to
establish my business in the garden
city

  what is your business spokane
inquired as she asked the question her
uncle who had stepped to the rear of
the shop to get a bottle of hair restorer
stopped to listen and several of the cus-
tomers who were seated near by pricked
up their ears

  give a guess challenged gallatin
with a laugh everybody else in walla
walla has been trying to solve that
puzzle for the past six days lets see
how good a guesser you are miss
spokane

  well i should say that your busi-
ness has something to do with chem-
icals the girl answered readily

  he stared at her in astonishment
now jhow on earth did you guess
that 

  spokane laughed by the stains on
your fingers one of the professors at
whitman college comes here to have
his nails trimmed and he always has
the same kind of stains on his hands
he told me they came from experi-
ments in chemistry

  by jove youre a wonder ex-
claimed gallatin sherlock holmes
and nick carter have nothing on you
yes those stains on my fingers came
also from experiments in chemistty
that is my line

  what are you going to do in walla
walla the girl asked are you going
to teach at whitman college

  no indeed i am going to run a
factory here

  oh what kind of a factory

  as she put the question chris and his
eavesdropping customers held their
breaths

  i am going to run an egg plant
gallatin announced

  a what


top-notch magazine

  an egg plant-a plant for the manu-
facture of eggs

  a frown of perplexity wrinkled the
manicure girls forehead then sud-
denly her face lighted up oh i un-
derstand you mean you are going to
make sugar eggs for easter time
gallatin smiled and shook his head
no i dont mean sugar eggs i mean
real eggs-the kind that you fry poach
scramble and make into omelets
thats the kind of egg were going to
manufacture miss spokane

  the girl laughed what a funny
way you have of putting things i
suppose you mean that youre going to
buy a chicken farm

  again gallatin shook his head no
i dont mean anything of the sort i
said i wras going to manufacture eggs
and i mean just that we shant need
any chickens at our factory i have
made a scientific discovery that is going
to put the hens out of business i have
invented a machine that can turn out as
perfect an egg as any chicken could
lay

  there was no mistaking the speakers
earnestness his eres were ablaze with
enthusiasm although he was address-
ing the manicure girl unconsciously he
had raised his voice so that it carried
to the other end of the long room

  for a moment his weird announce-
ment was received in silence then
suddenly the tension was broken by a
loud laugh of derision from larry
bradley

  going to put the hen out of busi-
ness  he scoffed id like to see this
wonderful machine

  gallatin turned to him avith quiet dig-
nity you shall have that privilege
very shortly my friend he said my
apparatus is on its way here i tele-
graphed to new york the other day to
have it shipped on and i expect it to
arrive to-morrow or the next day in
the meantime perhaps you would like
to see a sample of my work 

  a sample of your work

  yes i brought a couple of my eggs
from new york with me i have them
in my pocket they were made on the
small model machine with which i have

been conducting my experiments and
the result is not quite as perfect as the
product i expect to turn out with the
more elaborate machinery i plan to in-
stall here but they will serve to con-
vince you that my invention is thor-
oughly practical

  he plunged his hand in his pocket
and drew out a white oval object a
trifle larger than an ordinary hens egg
th a graceful bow he handed it to
the manicure girl

  to you miss spokane he said sol-
emnly shall be accorded the honor of
being the first person in the state of
washington and the first woman in the
whole world to inspect the latest tri-
umph of science over nature

chapter iii

the artificial egg

the others crowded around spokane
 as she stood fascinated staring at
the white oval object which rested in
the palm of her hand

  it feels as if it was made of chalk
she said running her finger over its
rough surface

  the shell is made of a plaster com-
position gallatin announced it is
slightly thicker and much tougher than
an ordinary eggshell in that respect
i think my invention is decidedly su-
perior to the product of the hen there
is much less danger of breakage

  chris wahman took the egg from his
niece and inspected it critically it is
wonderful he exclaimed except
that it is much whiter and a little larger
it looks just like a real egg

  pshaw sneered larry bradley
anybody can make a plaster-of-paris
egg that looks like a real egg from the
outside thats too eas but how
about the inside thats the question
you shall taste the inside and judge
for yourself my skeptical friend said
gallatin of course i dont expect
you to judge my egg by its shell alone
have you any cooking facilities here
chris 

  theres the hot-water tank and some
shaving mugs that have never been
used the proprietor of the high class
winged in walla walla



responded but why not take the eggs
to the little restaurant across the street
and have the chef cook em properly

  a good idea exclaimed gallatin
friends it has been regularly moved
and seconded that this meeting do now
adjourn to the little restaurant across
the street all in favor are cordially
invited to come along and witness the
test

  passers-by stared in wonder at the
procession which filed out of the barber
shop across main street and into the
smart set quick lunch room chris
and gallatin were in the lead the half
dozen customers and joe the bootblack
followed in close formation and
spokane and larry bradley brought up
the rear the latters face still wearing a
cynical sneer

  pete said chris to the proprietor
of the restaurant a stout red-faced
man with a head as bald as a pumpkin
we want you to do us a favor this
gentleman here has made a couple of
eggs-

  has done what the smart sets
chef interrupted sharply

  has made a couple of eggs chris
repeated greatly enjoying his neigh-
bors bewilderment thats his busi-
ness pete he is a manufacturer of
eggs-he makes em by machinery-
and he is going to open an egg factory
right here in walla walla hes
brought a couple of samples with him
and we want you to cook em for us so
that we can try what they taste like

  the proprietor of the lunch room
laughed ironically so this gentleman
makes eggs by machinery does he 
can he make milk too chris

  no said gallatin quietly i can-
not make milk my friend but if you
read the newspapers you ought to be
aware of the fact that milk is being
made by machinery at the present time
over in frankfort germany a ger-
man scientist has discovered a process
by which he extracts milk from vege-
tables and it is said to be so much like
cowrs milk that it is impossible for the
layman to tell which is which the
newspapers published long accounts of
the discovery a few wreeks ago

 why yes exclaimed spokane
wahman excitedly what he says is
true i read it in the bulletin the other
day

  well you cant believe all you see in
the papers muttered the presiding
genius of the smart set anyway
he added grudgingly even if they can
make milk by machinery youll have
a hard job convincing me that its pos-
sible to make eggs to my mind thats
going a wee bit over the limit

  gallatin smiled and took one of his
artificial eggs from his pocket whos
got the other one he inquired

  here it is said chris producing it

  the man who was going to put the
hen out of business handed the two
eggs to the restaurant keeper just
take these into your kitchen old chap
and break them open he requested

  the lunchman stared incredulously
at the white oval objects i suppose
this is a practical joke he grumbled
but just out of curiosity to see if
theres anything inside these lumps of
chalk ill be the goat come on all of
you and have a laugh on me

  they followed him back into the
kitchen where he handed the eggs to
the chef

  how do you want em cooked he
inquired turning to gallatin with an
ironical grin

  any way except boiled the latter
replied i must confess that in one
respect my rival the hen at present has
an advantage over me my eggs are
not good for boiling on account of the
thickness of the shell and certain in-
gredients it contains however i am
now experimenting with a new shell
formula which will overcome this de-
fect later on i expect to produce an
egg which can be boiled just as suc-
cessfully as an ordinary egg

  beginning to hedge muttered
larry triumphantly but gallatin only
smiled

  the chef took one of the egg manu-
facturers samples and struck it against
the edge of a dish the shell did not
break and larry bradley laughed
derisively it is solid he sneered i
knew this wise aleck was playing a joke


top-notch magazine

on us his wonderful eggs are nothing
but lumps of plaster

  hit it a little harder said gallatin
quietly to the chef as i have ex-
plained to the others the shell of my
eggs being thicker than ordinary eggs
are not so easily broken open

  the chef made a second attempt this
time rapping the egg more vigorously
against the side of the dish every-
body gave vent to an excited exclama-
tion as the shell broke into two pieces
and a semi solid yellowish substance
fell into the dish

  jimminy christopher it looks just
like the yolk of a real egg cried chris
wahman

  and it tastes just like the yolk of a
real egg boasted gallatin break
open the other one chef and cook them
both together so that therell be enough
for everybody to get a taste too bad
that i havent more samples writh me
everybody watched intently as the
chef opened the second egg placed it
together with the first in a frying pan
with the necessary amount of butter
and put them on the hot stove a few
minutes later they sawt the sizzling
viscous yolks shape themselves into two
firm orange-hued semiglobules each
fringed with a wide margin of white
they appeared to be as perfect a pair
of fried eggs as had ever been prepared
in the smart set kitchen

  wholl be the first to taste cried
gallatin as the chef lifted the frying
pan from the stove and deftly trans-
ferred its contents to a plate how
about you miss spokane  ladies first
if youre not afraid to venture i as-
sure you they wouldnt hurt you even
if you were to eat a hundred of them
i guarantee them to be every bit as
nutritious and appetizing as the old-
fashioned hen-made goods

  but are they fresh the manicure
girl asked hesitatingly you say you
brought them from new york with
you it must be several days since they
wyere laid-i mean made

  they are about two weeks old gal-
latin admitted but what of it
thats quite youthful compared to most
of the cold-storage eggs which are fed

to the innocent public besides my
eggs dont deteriorate nearly as quickly
as the natural kind theyll keep for
weeks even without ice thats another
advantage i can claim over my esteemed
rival the hen

  spokane took up a knife and fork
cut a morsel from the white border of
one of the eggs and put it in her mouth

  yum-yum  she exclaimed smack-
ing her red lips its awfully good

 me next said chris wahman
eagerly taking the knife and fork from
his niece

  by jinks he exclaimed as he
helped himself to a generous mouthful
it certainly does taste just like the
real thing any hen would be proud
to lay such eggs

  larry bradley was the third to sam-
ple the product the sneer disappeared
from the young barbers face as he
swallowed the dainty morsel he was
forced to agree with spokane and her
uncle that gallatins achievement was
truly remarkable

  then the proprietor of the lunch
room made the test he became as
enthusiastic as his predecessors

  you say you can turn these out in
quantities  he asked of gallatin

  certainly

  and what will the price be 

  about the same as ordinary eggs at
first - but later on i expect to be able
to cut the price in two it is then that
i shall drive the hen out of business
my friends cried gallatin oratorically
take my word for it that the chicken
is doomed to become as much of a back
number as the horse of course fowl
will always be in demand for eating
purposes but as producers of eggs they
wont be able to compete with my ma-
chine

  you can take my order right now
for a crate of your henless eggs said
the smart sets owner if they are
all as good as the samples i shall use
no other kind in my business from now
on

  hearing which larry bradley sighed
as has been said it was his great am-
bition to quit the barbering trade and
buy a poultry ranch he had figured
winged in walla walla



out that he could make a living for two
by selling eggs-hen-made goods-to
the local market now he saw his am-
bition nipped in the bud by this latest
achievement of science

  any wonder that he began to hate
mr rudolph gallatin

chapter iv

the world takes notice

it fell out that on the same day gal-

	la tin gave his informal demonstra-
tion before the astonished group in the
smart set quick lunch room at walla
walla doctor paul walden of russia
a scientist of world-wide renown
speaking before an assemblage of prom-
inent chemists at chicago made a pre-
diction that the time was not far distant
when chemistry would be able to pro-
duce an edible egg identical with that
laid by the time-honored hen

  doctor walden had never heard of
mr gallatin and as he subsequently
stated when the coincidence was
brought to his attention had no idea
that a device for manufacturing eggs
had already been invented he was
speaking purely theoretically when he
made his prediction before the body of
distinguished chemists in convention as-
sembled

  an associated press reporter who
covered the convention realizing that
the russian professors speech was hot
stuff sent it over the wire to his
home office in new york thence the
report was relayed to newspapers in all
parts of the united states so that the
following paragraphs found their way
into the office of the walla walla even-
ing bulletin

  chicago  sept th-doctor paul wal-
den of riga russia predicted here last
night that the next feat of chemistry would
be the making of eggs from air doctor
walden further predicted that a variety of
nitrogenous food would be made from the
air some day

  i  consider it practically certain that at
no distant day we will be drawing our food
supplies from the air said doctor walden
formerly we were able to do very little
with the uncombined nitrogen in the atmos-
phere but now we are able to harness it
and the possibilities that achievement sug-

gests are wonderful one of those possi-
bilities is the making of eggs by chemical
means an egg of course is nothing but
a complex compound of nitrogen oxygen
sulphur and hydrogen there is no logical
reason in mymind why the chemical  proc-
esses of the hen cannot be imitated in the
laboratory

  having edited this copy and sent it
to the composing room the city editor
of the bulletin went out to get his lunch
on east adler street he encountered
mike davis walla wallas chief of po-
lice whose unusually solemn coun-
tenance now wore a broad grin

  why the merriment mike the
editor inquired cant you let me in
on the joke

  i guess i can chuckled the police
official its really much too good to
keep to myself i have just come from
chris wahmans barber shop on main
street i found a lot of excitement
going on in there

  what was it about the bulletin
man demanded eagerly

  a chap had been in there claiming
he could make eggs said the police
chief between chuckles he claims
that he makes em by machinery and
that hes going to open an egg factory
right here in wralla walla

  thats a queer coincidence mut-
tered the editor thinking of the associ-
ated press dispatch he had just sent to
the composing room

  and the best part of the joke the
chief went on not heeding the inter-
ruption is that chris and all the others
in the barber shop believe what this fel-
low told them they assured me that
theyd seen some of the eggs he made
-seen them and tasted them and that
theyre fully convinced that his story is
on the level isnt that rich  why its
good enough to put in your paper
the bulletin man smiled did you
see the fellow mike

 not to-day he had left before i
dropped into the shop i know who
he is though its that mysterious chap
from new york named gallatin whos
stopping at the dacres ive been keep-
ing my eye on him ever since he struck
town the fellows acted sort of queer
and ive been suspicious of him


top-notch magazine

  i guess ill send a representative
to interview him said the editor he
may be crazy or he may have been
merely playing a practical joke on chris
and his friends at all events what he
has to say ought to make a funny yarn
half an hour later a reporter from
the bulletin called at the dacres hotel
and found mr rudolph gallatin lunch-
ing in the grillroom his repast con-
sisted of bacon and hard-boiled eggs

  did you make those eggs yourself
mr gallatin the scribe began step-
ping up to the table and pointing to the
plate with a grin

  no my son i didnt these are
ordinary hen fruit but theyre almost
as good as the kind i turn out who
are you 

  the bulletin man explained who he
was and the object of his call

  gallatin frowned so its got to the
newspapers eh news certainly does
travel fast in this town i didnt intend
to make public announcement of my dis-
covery just yet i preferred to wait
until my apparatus was installed here
but that little witch of a manicure girl
at the barber shop got me talking be-
fore i realized what i was doing how-
ever since the secret is out i have no
objection to giving you an interview
then you are actually serious about
your claim to be able to make eggs
the reporter asked tt isnt a hoax
certainly not if i were seeking to
perpetrate a hoax i assure you i
shouldnt come to walla walia to try it
the people here impress me as being
much too wide awake to be bunkoed
the newspaper man was obviously
gratified by this tribute to his fellow
townsmen

  what is rour process mr galla-
tin  he inquired would you mind
describing it in detail for the bulletinf
i cant very well go into details my
boy ive got to be careful for fear
of imitators all i can tell you is that
my machine is a contrivance which imi-
tates exactly the chemical processes of
the hen every chemist knows that an
egg is nothing more than a complex
compound of sulphur hydrogen nitro-
gen and oxygen the only problem be-

fore me was to imitate nature in the
skillful combining of these component
parts that problem i have solved
unconsciously gallatin had used al-
most the same words which doctor
walden had uttered in making his
prediction before the chicago conven-
tion of chemists the reporter who
had read the associated press report
before leaving the office was much im-
pressed by this fact

  you speak of being afraid of imi-
tators is not your machine patented
he inquired

  unfortunately  my apparatus is
not patentable

  not patentable the reporter re-
peated in astonishment why not
its a brand-new invention isnt it
well you see the machine consists
merely of a combination of devices
which are not new-various pieces of a
scientific apparatus which are already
in general use for other purposes law-
yers have advised me that on account
of that i cannot get a patent seems
mighty unfair doesnt it but as its
the law i have to submit to it all i
can do is to guard the secret of my
invention so closely that nobody will be
able to steal my idea

  then you dont intend to let any-
body see the machine when it arrives
the reporter asked suspiciously

  oh yes i shant object to people
coming to see it on the contrary
everybody will be welcome to visit my
factory and watch the eggs made but
i cannot permit anybody to examine
the machine closely nor can i answer
questions as to the details of my
process i shall be obliged to protect
myself to that extent the public cant
blame me for that

  of course not the interviewef
agreed have you selected a site fof
your egg factory yet mr gallatin 
yes i am going to rent a private
house on catherine street i have de-
cided that it will answer my purpose
better than a business building i saw
the owner this morning and came to
terms with him

  will you employ many people
  no that will not be necessary i
winged in walla walla



have engaged two men who were my
assistants in my laboratory work in
new york and abroad they are on
their way here now they are men
whom i can thoroughly trust i figure
that for the present the three of us will
be able to handle the factory between
us of course later on when the busi-
ness expands i may be obliged to take
on a larger force

  and you expect to sell your eggs
in the local market 

  i expect to sell my eggs to the whole
world my boy as soon as my factory
is running full blast

  excuse me for becoming personal
said the reporter but would you mind
saying something about yourself nat-
urally the bulletin readers will be
anxious to get some biographical facts
concerning the man who has made such
an important discovery

  mr gallatin smiled deprecating i
hate to talk about myself i am natu-
rally of a very modest disposition all
that i am going to tell you is that i
am an american but have spent most
of my life in europe i was educated
abroad and received my degree of doc-
tor of chemistry over there

  so you are a doctor of chemistry
exclaimed the interviewer would
you let me see your diploma

  mr gallatin stiffened i consider
that request exceedingly impertinent
young man besides even if i were
disposed to grant it i could not do so
my diploma is in new york i saw
no occasion to carry it around with
me

  the reporter returned to the bulletin
office in a puzzled frame of mind i
cant quite make him out he said to
his editor i am pretty sure that he
isnt a crank he talks intelligently
enough and appears to be in dead
earnest in view of that a p dispatch
from chicago although ive got my
suspicions im not prepared to say that
he isnt on the level

  hes probably a faker said the
editor however the interview will
make a good yarn write me a column
of it and well run it alongside of the
report of doctor waldens prediction

our readers can form their own con-
clusions as to the legitimacy of mr
gallatins claim to be able to make
eggs

  the city editor of the bulletin was
not the only person in the garden city
who suspected that mr rudolph galla-
tin was a faker after chief of police
mike davis had got over laughing at
what he had heard in the high class
tonsorial parlor it occurred to him
that it was more or less his official duty
to visit the dacres hotel and have a
talk with the man who was going to add
an egg factory to walla wallas in-
dustries

  he found gallatin in the hotel lobby
smoking a fragrant porto rico which
had been sold to him for an havana

  i hear youre going to make eggs
the police official began brusquely

  that is my intention chief hop
you have no objections rejoined the
other dryly

  well i dont know about that
whats the game 

  the game gallatin stared at his
questioner in pained astonishment i
am afraid i dont grasp your meaning
chief

  see here gallatin said the police
official sternly if its just a joke on
your part its none of my business of
course but if youve got an idea that
youre going to work any kind of a
flimflam game i warn you that youd
better not try it in this city you wont
be able to get away with it while im
on the job

  the egg man shook his head depre-
catingly chief i must say that i am
surprised-most disagreeably surprised
if this is the kind of treatment new
settlers get here i wonder that walla
walla is such a flourishing city

  new settlers have no reason to com-
plain of the way theyre treated in
walla walla-if theyre honest and re-
spectable was the grim response but
weve no use for any other kind the
police official looked straight into galla-
tins eyes i suppose youre planning
to sell shares in this wonderful egg
factory of yours eh


top-notch magazine

  certainly not i am planning to sell
nothing but eggs

  but if some rich member of this
community wished to invest his money
in your business you wouldnt exactly
object would you the chief smiled
ironically

  you are entirely mistaken gallatin
replied indignantly i am not looking
for financial backing i have all the
capital i need i resent these base in-
sinuations sir your tone is very of-
fensive to me i am a respectable citi-
zen engaged in a reputable undertaking
and you have no right to offer me these
gratuitous insults

  the police official shrugged his shoul-
ders i am offering you no insults
mr gallatin if your business is
reputable well and good but if it isnt
-well i consider it my duty to inform
you that walla walla has one of the
finest penitentiaries in the united
states and theres lots of room inside
with this grim hint chief davis
swung on his heels and walked out of
the hotel

  for some time afterward the arti-
ficial-egg man sat puffing at his cigar
decidedly glum and pensive

chapter v

the egg machine arrives

juir rudolph gallatin being
a very sensitive man was so dis-
couraged by the unfriendly attitude of
the chief of police and the reporter of
the bulletin that he actually thought
seriously of giving up the idea of estab-
lishing his egg factory in walla walla
he felt strongly inclined to go to some
other city where he would be more
courteously treated by the local offi-
cials and press

  after considerable reflection how-
ever he decided to remain and carry
out his project after all he mused
it is no more than natural that they
should be suspicious of me i didnt
even have a sample egg to show them
but wait until they visit my factory
and see the eggs come out of the ma-
chine right before their eyes i bet

theyll be ready to apologize for their
unjust suspicions then

  he derived a great deal of satisfac-
tion too from a news item he saw on
the front page of that evenings issue of
the walla walla bulletin it was the
associated press report of doctor paul
waldens interesting statement regard-
ing the possibility of making eggs by
chemistry this announcement was a
great surprise to gallatin he regarded
it as a very fortunate coincidence that
the world-famous chemist had been in-
spired to make these remarks at chi-
cago at the same time that he gallatin
was preparing to open his egg factory
in walla walla he told himself that
doctor wraldens statement was going
to help him a lot in his business

  the public wont pooh-pooh what
that professor says he reflected hes
too big a man to be ridiculed conse-
quently the public will be prepared to
take my eggs seriously now even that
chief of police ought to be convinced
when he reads this evenings bulletin 

  the following day gallatins ap-
paratus arrived from new york
there were three large packing cases
of it they were placed on a wagon
and conveyed to the private house on
catherine street which the artificial-
egg man had leased for his factory

  simultaneously with the arrival of
the apparatus came the two men from
new york whom gallatin had engaged
to help him run his business the
were swarthy foreign-looking chaps of
almost sinister aspect they had very
little to say even to gallatin at least not
in public

  they helped their employer lift the
cases onto the wagon at the depot and
then accompanied him to the catherine
street place where they assisted him
to unload the wagon and carry the
boxes into the house

  hearing that the wonderful egg ma-
chine had actually arrived many curi-
ous persons flocked to the factory for
thanks to the notice in the bulletin and
the gossip which had emanated from
chris wahmans barber shop and the
smart set quick lunch room all
walla walla knew by this time of gal-
winged in walla walla



latins contemplated venture and was
greatly interested nobody was al-
lowed inside the building however the
doors were locked and all the window
shades drawn gallatin and his aids
went about the task of unpacking the
boxes assembling the various parts of
the apparatus and putting the factory
into running order with the utmost se-
crecy a notice tacked to the front door
informed all callers that a public demon-
stration would be given as soon as the
egg machine was ready for business
but that until that time no person would
be admitted to the premises but the
eager public did not have long to wait
inside of two days everything was
ready then gallatin threw open the
doors of his egg factory and invited the
world to come and inspect his great in-
vention

  the house which the artificial-egg
man had leased was a six-room frame
structure of the bungalow type there
were four rooms on the ground floor
and two rooms upstairs the egg-
making apparatus was installed in one
of these upper rooms the entire ground
floor being used as an office and ship-
ping department

  the machine itself was a weird-look-
ing affair perhaps it is needless to
state that notwithstanding its capacity
to lay eggs it bore no outward resem-
blance to a chicken or any other kind of
fowl just what it did look like it is
difficult to describe it was made of
metal glass wood and rubber and was
a queer conglomeration of wheels
pipes valves retorts and tanks it
stood about four feet high and cov-
ered a great deal of floor space

  one part of it bore some slight re-
semblance to an air pump and another
part of it was not unlike one of those
patent washing machines which are
supposed to enable the housewife to dis-
pense with the services of her washer-
woman from the fact that splashes of
plaster were visible on the outside of
this particular section of the apparatus
visitors gathered that it was here that
the shells of the artificial eggs were
formed they had to draw their own
conclusions as to the functions of the

various parts for the inventor posi-
tively refused to explain the workings
of his apparatus he repeated to his
audience what he had told the bulletin
reporter-that he was obliged to main-
tain this attitude in order to protect
himself against would-be infringers

  but whatever the secrets of its mech-
anism there was no denying the fact
that the machine could lay eggs with a
facility calculated to cause the most
zealous of hens to go mad with envy
and despair one of the first persons
to visit the egg factory was miss
spokane wahman gallatins face
lighted up as he caught sight of the
pretty manicure girl he stepped for-
ward eagerly to welcome her

  this is indeed a great honor he
said of all the people in walla wtalla
-in the whole world in fact-there is
none whom i would rather see here
than you miss spokane-

  although he spoke in a low tone-
for there were several other persons in
the room-there was so much ardor in
his voice and his dreamy eyes looked
into hers so intensely that in spite of
herself she blushed

  am i in time to witness the first
demonstration she asked seeking to
turn the conversation into a less per-
sonal channel

  yes i was just about to start the
machine i hope you believe that i
meant what i said to you just now
miss spokane he whispered i cant
find words to tell you what a hit you
made with me the very first time i saw
you it was a case of-

  i wish you would hurry up and start
the machine she interrupted i am
just dying with curiosity to see how it
works besides im in a hurry to get
back to the shop

  the inventor walked over to a table
on which were a lot of bottles and a
rack of glass test tubes he mixed
some of the contents of several of the
bottles in one of the test tubes and
then stepped up to the machine and
poured the concoction into a funnel-
shaped affair which protruded from
one end then he pulled a lever and
the eggmaker started into action


top-notch magazine

  there was a whirring of wheels a
wheezing sound as though air were
being sucked through pipes and a noise
like the buzzing of a giant bee these
weird sounds continued for about four
minutes then suddenly a gong
clanged the machinery stopped and
from a brass spout which curved down-
ward an egg dropped into a basket lined
thickly on the sides and bottom with
cotton batting

  gallatin picked up the white oval and
held it toward the gfoup of amazed
spectators behold ladies and gentle-
men the first henless egg ever laid in
walla walla he exclaimed tri-
umphantly now for a few more

  this time he mixed up a much larger
quantity of the chemicals and poured
the concoction into the eggmaker the
wheels whirred again the medley of
weird noises was repeated and pres-
ently the eggs began to drop into the
cotton batting gallatin triumphantly
handed them out among his visitors

  take them home and try them on
your gas stoves he urged cook
them any way rou please except boiling
them i regret to say ladies and gen-
tlemen that at present my eggs wont
boil successfully but in all other re-
spects i guarantee them to be just as
good as natural eggs

  then he stepped over to where spo-
kane wahman was standing well
what do you think of my machine he
asked softly

  it is marvelous declared the mani-
cure girl her eyes sparkling in a half
whisper she added i think you are
the most wonderful man i have ever -
met

 chapter vi

 iis rival

the fame of mr rudolph gallatin
and his egg factory quickly spread
the local correspondents of the news
agencies and of the papers of the big
cities telegraphed accounts of the in-
vention to their home offices soon the
press of the entire country-of the
whole world in fact-was talking about
wralla wallas wonderful eggs some
newspapers treated the matter face-

tiously and accused gallatin of being
a charlatan and a faker others dis-
cussed the new eggs with the utmost
gravity and hailed their inventor as a
public benefactor wrho was going to
solve the problem of the high cost of
living

  although it had been announced that
the manufactured eggs could not at
first be sold any cheaper than the
natural ones and although in addition
it was pointed out that gallatins crea-
tions were no good for boiling orders
and requests for samples soon began to
pour in by mail and wire from all parts
of the world dealers found that the
free advertising which the newspapers
had given to the novelty had created a
big demand for artificial eggs the
curious public wished to buy them just
to see what they were like

  his correspondence became so heavy
that gallatin found it a physical impos-
sibility to handle it all himself the two
men whom he had brought from new
york to act as his assistants were not
good at clerical work so it looked as if
he would have to hire a private secre-
tary

  then it was he made the discovery
that in addition to the trade she fol-
lowed at the tonsorial parlor miss spo-
kane wahman could use a typing ma-
chine and write shorthand she had
taken a correspondence-school course in
these subjects recently with the idea of
quitting the manicure business and get-
ting a place in an office as soon as her
uncle could find somebody to take her
table at the high class emporium

  when he heard this gallatin offered
her a tempting salary to come to work
for him at the egg factory chris
wahman was willing to let her go and
the girl herself was eager the only
person who strenuously objected to the
plan was larry bradley

  the good-looking young barber was
filled with despair when he heard that
the girl he loved was going to work for
gallatin

  dont you let her do it mr wah-
man he begged his employer its no
kind of a job for a refined girl like spo-
kane
winged in walla walla



  why not chris demanded its a
much better job than the one shes got
here hes offering her a bigger salary
to start with and typewriting is con-
sidered more dignified than manicur-
ing although why it should be reckoned
so is more than i can tell of course i
hate to lose her the old shop wont
seem like the same place without her
but as long as its for the girls good
im not going to stand in her way
but is it for her good larry con-
tended  dont like that fellow galla-
tin i dont like his looks theres
something crooked about him im sure
and those two foreign chaps hes got
working for him look like a couple of
cutthroats

  hah exclaimed chris impatiently
youre jealous thats whats the
matter with you gallatin is all right
doesnt he come here regulatly every
morning to get shaved no matter how
busy he is he told me the other day
that he has never in his life shaved him-
self ive got respect for a man like
that it shows character you get
busy honing those razors now young
man and dont worry about my niece
shes a girl thats well able to take care
of herself

  of course larry appealed to the girl
herself i wish youd stay here he
urged itll be miserable here with-
out you spokane he was diplomatic
enough to realize that it would have
been indiscreet to try to warn her
against gallatin although he was really
honest in his prejudice against the arti-
ficial-egg man

  for some reasons i too shall be
sorry to leave here the girl said but
the position at the egg factory is a
much better job and i feel that it is
my duty to take it

  but why do you need a better job
larry protested it isnt as if youre
going to be working much longer
arent we going to be married soon
spokane

  i think not the girl replied coldly
even if there were no other reasons
you could scarcely expect me to marry
a man who is barely making enough
money to support himself

 but im going to make enough
money to support both of us before
long he urged you just wait until
ive saved tip enough to quit the barber
business and buy that chicken ranch
weve talked about so often spokane
im afraid that dream of yours is
over larry said the girl with a pity-
ing smile air gallatins egg factory
is going to put the chicken farmers out
of business instead of making the
fortune you expect youll lose your
savings if you buy that ranch

  no i wont he asserted doggedly
hes charging as much as anybody for
his eggs and theyre no good for boil-
ing so why shouldnt we be able to
compete with him im not afraid of
gallatin and his egg factory

  but hes going to cut the price in
two later on spokane reminded him
and he is now working on a formula
for a new kind of shell which will make
his egg boil just as well as natural eggs
you wont be able to compete with him
then

  then ill try something else de-
clared larry confidently ill raise
alfalfa or wheat theres lots of money
in them and thank goodness they
cant make em by machinery refuse
this offer of gallatins spokane and
stick to manicuring for a little while
longer it wont be very long now
before ill be in a position to get mar-
ried and-

  nonsense the girl interrupted
sharply im not going to refuse mr
gallatins offer im going to take the
job and as for getting married to you
larry bradley i dont know whether
id be willing even if you were to buy
a farm j-ive been thinking that
perhaps were not exactly suited for
each other i like you a whole lot but
i-im not quite sure that i care for
you enough to marry you

  you didnt feel that way about it be-
fore that-before gallatin came to
town declared the wretched young
barber jealously i suppose you care
for him more than you do for me and
thats the real reason why you want to
go to work at the egg factory

  how absurd exclaimed spokane


top-notch magazine

blushing vividly see here mr brad-
ley she added indignantly youve
got no right to talk to me like that are
you daring to insinuate that im the
kind of a girl that would run after a
man you know very well that its the
position im thinking about

  but this angry denial did not con-
vince larry that she was not in love
with the producer of scientific eggs
he had not failed to observe the blush
which had come to her face and he
drew his own gloomy conclusions
therefrom his misgivings increased
when a few days after spokane had
entered upon her duties at the egg fac-
tory gallatin paid a social call one
evening at the home of chris wahman
with whom spokane resided hearing
of this visit larry was not so simple
as to suppose that his rival had gone
there to enjoy the society of mr and
mrs chris

  the next evening he received even a
greater shock gallatin took spokane
to a show with her uncles and aunts
permission not to the moving pictures
at the dime or the arcade mind you
but box seats at a dollar and a half a
piece at the keylor-grand theater and
supper afterward in the luxurious
dining room of the grand hotel on
several occasions before the advent of
the artificial-egg man larry had taken
spokane to shows but he had enter-
tained her at the ten-cent moving pic-
ture houses or at the best had treated
her to twenty-five-cent gallery seats at
the keylor-grand with a dish of ice
cream afterward any wonder that
he was filled with despair when he
learned of the luxury which his rival
had lavished upon her  only the fact
that he didnt know how to swim pre-
vented him from hurling himself into
the depths of the walla walla river

chapter vii

eggs is eggs

ne of the specialties of the high
class tonsorial parlor was-and
probably still is-an egg shampoo this
treatment as its name implies consists
of rubbing the white of a raw egg into

the scalp an expert having made the
discovery that raw eggs have great
hair-restoring qualities

  prior to the arrival of mr rudolph
gallatin in the garden city chris had
been using ordinary hens eggs for this
purpose but since artificial eggs had
been brought to his attention he had
experimented and had satisfied himself
that they were quite as effective as the
natural kind for shampooing purposes

  so chris laid in a supply of galla-
tins brand not that they were any
cheaper than nor in any way superior
to hen-made eggs but they were a nov-
elty and the high class being a strictly
up-to-date establishment always had
an eye peeled for novelties

  one morning about a week after
gallatin had taken miss spokane wah-
man to the show a customer came into
the barber shop and seated himself in
the chair over which larry bradley
presided

  i want a shave haircut singe and
an egg shampoo he announced

  we have two kinds of eggs sir
said larry when the other matters were
disposed of-machine-made and hen-
made whichll you have

  he scowled as he asked the question
he hated toboost his rivals product
but chris had ordered him to give all
customers their choice so as to display
the resourcefulness of the shop

  oh give me the artificial the cus-
tomer responded ive got a prejudice
against em for eating purposes but i
guess theyre all right for the hair
seems a sin to waste a real egg if the
other kindll answer the purpose just as
well

  larry walked over to a cut-glass bowl
on the marble counter which contained
both kinds of eggs and selected one
with a plaster shell

  he broke it open immediately he
did so it became oppressively evident to
him and simultaneously to everybody
else in the shop that this particular egg
was not like other eggs-not even like
other artificial eggs in other words it
was an egg with an individuality which
impressed itself forcibly upon every-
body within a hundred yards of it
winged in walla walla



  never mind the shampoo gasped
the customer tugging at the apron in
which he was enveloped ive changed
my mind let me out of here quick
take it and throw it out in the
street spluttered chris addressing
larry be careful though not to
throw it in front of this shop or the
store of one of our regular customers
put it in the gutter in front of hooper
the hardware mans store he shaves
himself with a safety razor

  larry carefully deposited the dis-
turbance in an empty shaving mug
wrapped a towel around it and hurried
out of the shop he did not however
carry out the instructions which his em-
ployer had given to him regarding the
disposition of the egg which wras not
like other eggs instead of placing it in
the gutter in front of the store of the
man who shaved himself with a safety
razor he carried it up main street hug-
ging it to his breast writh as much
ecstasy as if it had been a bouquet of
fragrant and beautiful flowers on his
handsome face was a joyous smile-
the first that had appeared there in two
weeks

  he did not stop until he reached po-
lice headquarters arrived there he en-
tered the private office of chief mike
davis and stepped up eagerly to the
desk at which that official was seated

  chief he cried excitedly ive got
something important

  if you dont take it away immedi-
ately growled the head of walla
wallas constabulary rising hastily and
throwing open all the windows fll
take you before judge mckinney on a
charge of assault

  chief cried larry bradley ve-
hemently that fellow gallatin is a
swindler and i can prove it

  tell me about it over the telephone
the chief pleaded going to the window
for air

  ive got the proof right here the
young barber exclaimed triumphantly
waving the towel-enwrapped shaving
mug

  it appears to be pretty strong proof
-whatever it is grunted the police of-
ficial beginning to realize that there was

ca

no getting rid of this excited visitor and
his exhibit

  gallatins eggs are frauds cried
the young man with the frenzy of a
fanatic his eggmaking machine is a
fake his eggs are nothing but or-
dinary eggs that were laid by a hen
ive come to demand as a citizen that
you arrest that crook

  you say that his eggs are ordinary
eggs said the chief sharply how do
you know that

  because ive got one of them right
here larry started to remove the
towel from the shaving mug

  never mind uncovering it cried
the other hastily it isnt at all neces-
sary so you call that an ordinary
egg

  certainly its an ordinary hen-
made egg gone bad

  how do you know that it isnt a
machine-made egg gone bad inquired
the chief dryly

  because replied larry joyously
its so very bad chief that its got half
a chicken in it no machine-made egg
could be like that let me show

  never mind the other interrupted
quickly ill take your word for it
you look like a truthful young man
just place that exhibit on the window
sill and close all the windows then we
can talk more freely

  youre right said the chief after
his visitor had carried out these in-
structions gallatins eggs are fakes
theyre nothing more or less than hens
eggs coated with plaster of paris so as
to give them the appearance of having
an artificial shell his wonderful egg
machine is the most preposterous fraud
ever perpetrated in the state of wash-
ington but if you think youve
brought me any news young man let
me tell you that youre very much mis-
taken ive known that such was the
case ever since the day he opened his
egg factory

  you have exclaimed larry in
astonishment

  certainly when i heard him make
the statement that his artificial eggs


top-notch magazine

  could not be boiled i immediately
guessed the answer they would boil
all right if they were kept on the stove
long enough but he was afraid that the
hot water would cause the plaster of
paris to come off and the fraud thus be
laid bare so he craftily cautioned the
public against boiling them i got hold
of one of the first eggs that he handed
out and boiled it in spite of his warn-
ing as soon as i saw the real eggshell
beneath the plaster i knew his secret
you knew this all the time and yet
didnt arrest him or stop him from
going ahead with his swindle ex-
claimed larry reproachfully i am
surprised at you chief

  are you really well maybe you
wouldnt be so surprised young man
if you were to stop to think for a min-
ute you say you wrant gallatin ar-
rested perhaps youll tell me on what
charge

  for swindling of course obtaining
money under false pretenses

  how was he obtaining money under
false pretenses

  larry looked his astonishment at the
question by selling hens eggs and
pretending that he made them he an-
swered indignantly

  chief davis smiled whimsically
im not so sure that that constitutes
swindling in the eyes of the law sup-
pose a man was to sell you a piece of
glass and make you believe that it was
a diamond theres no doubt that you
could send him up for that but sup-
pose he was to sell you a genuine dia-
mond and claim that it was a piefce of
glass do you suppose that the judge
would hold that hed done anything
criminal now its the same way with
eggs gallatin has been selling genuine
eggs and claiming that theyre imita-
tions but he doesnt claim that his al-
leged imitations are better than real
eggs im not sure that hes done any-
thing unlawful

  but why should he pretend that his
eggs are imitations larry protested
there must be something crooked be-
hind it

  of course theres something crooked
behind it the other agreed that gal-

  latin hasnt been making any profit by
the sale of the eggs is evident on the
contrary he must be losing money for
he has been selling them at cost and
charging nothing for the plaster-of-
paris jacket yet he must figure that
its going to pay him somehow or he
wouldnt be doing it he isnt in busi-
ness for his health you can be sure and
i dont believe hes doing it for a prac-
tical joke thats why ive been lying
low i wanted to find out just what the
game was before i made a move

  i see said larry but how long
do you intend to wait 

  not much longer i hope just as

soon as i learn- chief davis was

interrupted by the ringing of his tele-
phone bell he excused himself to his
visitor and went to the instrument
when he returned his face wore a
frown

  i suppose id better go around and
put that egg factory out of business
right away he grumbled its out
of the question now to wait until ive
got to the bottom of gallatins game

  why so  larry asked

  because the bulletin is going to
print an expose of his fake-egg ma-
chine in its next issue the editor just
called me up to tell me theyve had
the story in type for days but as a
favor to me theyve been holding it un-
til i was ready now they say they
cant wait any longer theyre afraid
of some other paper springing it first
the chief reached for his uniform cap
want to come along with me and in-
terview mr rudolph gallatin he said
to larry

  and the latter accepted the invitation
with great eagerness

chapter viii

an interrupted proposal

cpokane wahman sat at her
desk at the egg factory type-
writing a letter to a big department
store in new york which had tele-
graphed an order for ten crates of arti-
ficial eggs to be shipped immediately
she wrote
winged in walla walla



  dear sir  replying to your wire we re-
gret to say that it would be impossible for
us to ship you any eggs until the end of next
month our factory is how being worked
to capacity filling orders already on hand
and we find it out of the question to take
care of any new business at present

  spokane did not have to consult her
stenographic notes in order to write this
letter she knew its form by heart
she had written hundreds of letters of
similar import since she had come to
work at the egg factory

  a puzzled frown creased the girls
smooth brow as she took the page from
the typewriter she could not under-
stand her employers business methods
at all it seemed to her that he was
deliberately turning down orders which
need not have been turned down for
being a bright and observant young
woman she had not failed to note that
the egg machine was not being worked
to capacity at all on the contrary it
was idle for long stretches each day
it was only at intervals-mostly when
visitors came to inspect the factory-
that gallatins noisy apparatus became
active

  not that spokane ever went to see
the machine work her desk was on the
ground floor of the private residence
which gallatin had converted into a fac-
tory and she never had occasion to go
upstairs to the room in which the eggs
were manufactured but she could
hear when the machine was working
and when it was inactive for the weird
sounds it made when in motion pene-
trated to the room which gallatin had
fitted up as an office

  there was another sound too which
sometimes reached her ears as she sat
at her typewriter this was a faint
rumbling which seemed to come from
beneath the house she observed that
this sound always came when the egg
machine was in action and at no other
time but she was quite sure that it
did not issue from the room upstairs
in which the egg making apparatus was
installed

  once she had questioned gallatin
about this mysterious noise which
seemed to come from below the house
and he had laughed and told her that

it was caused by the vibration of the
machinery upstairs she had observed
though that her question made him
nervous and uneasy he seemed much
provoked to find that her ears were so
sharp

  these things would have worried spo-
kane  she would have felt sure that
something very irregular was going on
at the egg factory if she had not had
such faith in her employer every day
she became more and more convinced
that a man with the lovely personality
of mr rudolph gallatin could not pos-
sibly do anything wrong

  but its very queer about those or-
ders she said to herself now as she
finished the letter to the new york de-
partment store i wonder why he
writes to tell everybody that he cant
supply them with eggs when he ought
to be glad to take advantage of this rush
of business

  as she sat musing at her typewriter
gallatin came into the room his eyes
lighted up as he caught sight of her
pretty face he stepped eagerly
toward her desk

  little girl he said ardently you
look very charming to-day-even more
so than usual do you know that you
make more of a hit with me every time
i see you

  mr gallatin she returned do you
know that if you are going to talk to me
like that i shall have to hand in my res-
ignation  have you forgotten your
promise 

  i want you to hand in your resigna-
tion he rejoined i know i promised
your uncle that if hed let you come to
work here id never pay you compli-
ments or talk anything except business
to you during office hours but i cant
help it spokane i cant wait until
after business hours to tell you whats
on my mind now i want you to throw
up this job little girl because ive got a
better one to offer you at least i hope
youll consider it a better one i want
you to become mrs rudolph gallatin

  what answer she would have made
to this proposal the egg man did not
have a chance to learn just then for
the conversation was interrupted at this


top-notch magazine

point by the entry of chief of police
mike davis and larry bradley

  dont listen to him spokane cried
the latter who had stepped into the
room in time to hear gallatins clos-
ing sentence this fellow has no right
to talk to you like that hes a
swindler

  a swindler exclaimed the egg
man advancing with much dignity
toward his accuser you had better
be careful young man thats not a
pleasant name to call anybody

  its a name that fits you larry re-
torted hotly we know all about your
fake eggs

  fake eggs gallatin repeated with
a deprecating smile say chief is this
young friend of yours crazy or just
plain drunk

  i dont imagine that hes either
the police official replied dryly hes
just a litle excited by a discovery he
made a while ago when he opened one
of your eggs

  oh is that it said gallatin coolly
what was the discovery

  he found a chicken in it

  a chicken the egg man laughed
incredulously you must be joking
chief i cant believe that my eggs are
as wonderful as all that and yet he
added staring pensively up at the ceil-
ing after all why shouldnt my eggs
hatch in composition they are exactly
the same as natural eggs i have al-
ways contended that some day science
would be able to create life by arti-
ficial means

  he turned to spokane an excited
look in his dreamy eyes just imagine
my dear if these chaps are really seri-
ous about that chicken i have achieved
the greatest triumph in the history of
science the name of rudolph galla-
tin will go down through the centuries
as the genius who first succeeded in
producing life in the laboratory it is
true that loeb and some other prom-
inent scientists have been making ex-
periments in the same direction and
claim to have succeeded in producing
by chemistry the eggs of the sea urchin
but their success is open to doubt
anyway what is their achievement

compared to mine even if their
claims be true they have produced only
the eggs of the sea urchin-the lowest
form of animal life while i-i ru-
dolph gallatin have made an egg which
can be hatched into a chicken ah
what a feat

  chief davis laughed ironically gal-
latin youre immense old doctor
cook was a piker compared to you but
if you think you can get away with that
bluff you might as well come out of
your dream that egg was a cold-
storage egg the only part of it that
you made was the plaster-of-paris coat
you placed over the ordinary shell and
thats true about every other egg which
has come out of this fake factory

chapter ix

mr gallatin explains

allatin started to protest but
the chief of police silenced him
with a peremptory gesture hold on
there just listen to what ive got to
say and youll realize how useless it is
to keep up this bluff i know that your
eggs are nothing but ordinary eggs
coated with plaster because ive been
experimenting with them by boiling
them until the plaster came off and
showed the real shell underneath and
whats more i know where you got the
eggs ive been watching all those bar-
rels youve been receiving from dayton
you pretended that they contained the
plaster material you made your egg-
shells of but i had my suspicions it
struck me that if those barrels con-
tained nothing but plaster it was kind
of odd that they should have been
marked handle with care so i in-
vestigated i learned that you have a
friend in dayton who has been buying
a lot of eggs lately-ordinary hens
eggs i learned that this friend of
yours has been packing these eggs in
barrels and shipping them to walla
walla consigned to mr rudolph gal-
latin of catherine street i learned

that-

  i guess thats sufficient chief gal-
latin broke in with a grim laugh
youve told me enough to convince
winged in walla walla



me that my wonderful egg machine has
outlived its usefulness as you rightly
remarked it would be foolish on my
part to attempt to keep up the bluff any
longer under the circumstances

  he turned with a deprecating smile
to spokane the girls face was very
white

  then its true she faltered you
really are a swindler

  thats a harsh word protested gal-
latin chief he inquired anxiously
arc you aware of the motive which in-
spired me to attempt this merry little
hoax

  i cant say that i am the police of-
ficial replied candidly an expression
of relief flitted across the egg mans
countenance but davis added with
a frown dont try to make me believe
that you did it for a joke because that
wont go i am quite certain that you
expected to make money by your daring
fraud

  gallatin laughed almost jauntily
you are quite right i did expect to
make money-big money i dont mind
admitting that if my scheme had gone
through all right it would in all proba-
bility have made me a multimillionaire
little girl he went on addressing spo-
kane please dont look so shocked i
have committed no crime there was
nothing wrong in what i attempted to
do

  nothing wrong the girl cried
scornfully you have just admitted
that you were trying to work a swindle
which if it had succeeded would have
made you a millionaire

  not a swindle gallatin protested
i object to the use of that word my
scheme was perfectly legitimate all
that i was trying to do was to establish
a corner in eggs

  a corner in eggs spokane re-
peated with a perplexed frown which
was reflected on the faces of chief da-
vis and larry bradley

  yes i was trying to get control of
the worlds supply of chickens galla-
tin explained dont you grasp the
idea  it is really very simple my
plan was to throw a scare into the rais-
ers of poultry by making them believe

that eggs were being turned out by ma-
chinery i figured that when they heard
about my egg factory they would be
eager to sell their chicken farms at a
sacrifice fearing that the hen was
doomed to become as much of a back
number as the horse has been made by
the automobile then of course it was
my intention to send out agents all over
the world to buy these poultry ranches
at a bargain

  but it would have required a tre-
mendous amount of capital to do that
exclaimed spokane her eyes wide with
wonder

  it certainly would gallatin agreed
smiling but i have all the capital i
need two of the biggest men in wall
street have been backing me in this
project they wrere shrewd enough to
realize what a paying game it would be
for with the worlds supply of chickens
in our control it would have been an
easy matter for us to boost the price of
eggs to any figure we desired

  and make the cost of living even
higher than it is already exclaimed
larry bradley indignantly

  gallatin shrugged his shoulders
business is business my gloomy young
demagogue we big financial operators
cannot afford tqt be sentimental at
least he corrected himself as his gaze
rested upon his stenographers pretty
face we cannot afford to be senti-
mental so far as the general public is
concerned

  spokane cried larry tensely ob-
serving the blush that came to the girls
cheeks as her eyes met gallatins ardent
gaze surely you cant have any use
for this fellow after what you have just
heard just think what wrould have
happened if his infernal scheme had
gone through think of eggs being so
high in price that only the rich could
afford to buy them think of the poor
having to go without cakes and
custards men like this fellow are
worse than murderers i hope you feel
that way about it spokane

  well i dont know the girl an-
swered thoughtfully after all as he
says business is business while it
seems heartless for anybody to try to


top-notch magazine

raise the price of eggs i suppose things
of that sort are being done every day
in the business world by perfectly hon-
est and respectable men anyhow i
am glad to find that mr gallatin is not
a swindler

  the look which she bestowed upon
the egg man as she said this almost
broke larry bradleys heart

chapter x

a purchase of eggs

the scene now changes from walla

	walla to new york city and in-
troduces thomas barry more fre-
quently referred to among his associates
as no  barry was a stockily built
man of middle age with a pair of keen
eyes and a physiognomy which some-
how reminded one of a fox terrier
from the fact above stated that he was
more often referred to by a number
than by a name it must not be assumed
that he was a convict on the con-
trary far from being a lawbreaker he
was one of the laws most zealous
guardians he worked for an old gen-
tleman named uncle sam and it was
his duty to track down and bring to
justice those who sought to rob or cheat
his employer

  in the line of these duties no  be-
came keenly interested in the move-
ments of a certain flashily dressed man
of prosperous aspect who was known
to his neighbors as john broads al-
though that was not his baptismal name
like mr barry mr broads often
found it convenient to assume an alias
although their respective reasons for
doing so were entirely dissimilar

  so interested was no  in the move-
ments of mr broads that he had been
shadowing him persistently for three
days he had found out already
where the latter lived how he employed
his time where he spent his money the
social circles in which he moved and a
lot of other information more or less
valuable but no  was not satisfied
there was still certain information con-
cerning mr broads which he wanted
and which thus far he had been un-

able to obtain in spite of his persistent
shadowing

  on the day that rudolph gallatin
was describing in walla walla his am-
bitious plan to corner the worlds mar-
ket in eggs no  was standing out-
side an apartment house in the upper
section of new york closely but unob-
trusively watching the front entrance

  it was a nice-looking apartment
house with marble halls gilded ele-
vators and uniformed hallboys but it
was not its splendor which attracted the
attention of no  the reason he was
so interested in it was because it was
the home of mr john broads

  no  had ascertained this fact three
days previously in his quiet unob-
trusive way he had elicited the informa-
tion from the employees that broads
occupied a three-room-and-kitchenette
apartment on the fifth floor that his
wife shared the apartment with him
and that there were no other occupants
not even a maid

  no  had seen the wife he had
called at the apartment the day before
in the guise of a book agent to make
her acquaintance it was for her and
not for her husband that he was watch-
ing now he had made up his mind
that the information which he still
lacked could be best obtained by
shadowing mrs broads

  pretty soon broads came up the
street walking with his usual jaunty
stride he was whistling an operatic
air and gayly swinging a gold-headed
stick as he reached the apartment-
house entrance he glanced around him
in all directions like a man used to being
shadowed but no  had dodged into
a convenient doorway on the opposite
side of the street and broads went into
the house without noticing him

  fifteen minutes later mrs broads
emerged from the house she was
dressed for the street and carried a
marketing basket which she swung
ostentatiously by its handle as though
she were anxious to have the whole
world take notice that she was about
to go out and get household supplies

  no  waited until she was halfway
up the block and then he trailed along
winged in walla walla



behind her he followed her around
the corner to the avenue and saw her
enter a butcher shop taking care not
to be seen by her he peered into the
doorway and saw her buy two pork
chops these she placed in her market-
ing basket and then came out

  it isnt the butcher said no  to
himself as he once more swung into
line behind her

  mrs broads next dropped into a
bakery and bought some rolls once
more no  watched her stealthily
from the sidewalk

  it might be the baker he mused
but i scarcely think so i know that
baker and hes an honest fellow how-
ever if nothing more promising turns
up ill interview him later on

  the woman proceeded up the avenue
a couple of blocks and then swung into
a side street and entered a small gro-
cery

  this looks more like it said no 
to himself as he glanced through the
window and got a view of the man be-
hind the counter a swarthy shifty-eyed
fellow of decidedly foreign appearance

  mrs broads made several purchases
from this man from the sidewalk no
 watched him weigh out coffee sugar
and rice and saw her place the pack-
ages in her marketing basket then the
grocer mounted a stepladder and took
a box from a shelf from this box he
drew a half dozen eggs and handed
them to the woman these too she
placed in her basket and paying for
her purchases in cash walked out of
the store

  no  no longer sought to follow
her he waited until she was out of
sight and then he entered the grocery

  got any eggs  he inquired of the
man behind the counter

  certainly the latter answered
pointing to a crate of fresh eggs stand-
ing in front of the counter

  no  shook his head i dont want
that kind i want some of those from
that box up there he pointed toward
the shelf

  an anxious look came to the others
shifty eyes he shot a searching glance
at his visitor those are artificial

eggs he announced the new kind
which that fellow out in walla walla
is making

  thats the kind i want said no 
quietly

  i shouldnt advise you to take them
the grocer exclaimed nervously they
cost as much as ordinary eggs and my
customers tell me theyre not nearly as
good

  nevertheless i want them im
curious to see what theyre like let
me have a dozen

  the other shrugged his shoulders
and muttering something under his
breath mounted the stepladder from
the box on the shelf he counted out
twelve eggs with plaster-of-paris shells
placed them in a paper bag and handed
them to the customer the latter took
one from the bag and rapped it sharply
against the edge of the counter the
plaster shell broke and what looked like
the yolk of an ordinary egg dropped to
the floor

  no  appeared to be disappointed
he took another egg from the paper bag
and split it open with the same result

  hey what are you doing the
grocer growled you cant make a
mess like that on my floor are you
crazy

  i guess on second thought a dozen
eggs wont be enough for me said
no  quietly ill take all thats in
that box up there just lift the box
down and ill help myself

  there aint any more in the box
the grocer said -nervously i gave you
all i have mister

  oh no you didnt no  de-
clared pleasantly just bring that box
down here and let me see if i cant find
some more

  the others face suddenly became dis-
torted with fear and rage his right
hand went almost spasmodically toward
his hip pocket but before he could draw
the weapon concealed there his visitor
had him covered with the automatic gun
he always carried in readiness for such
emergencies

  five minutes later the grocer with the
shifty eyes walked out of the store in
handcuffs escorted by no  the


top-notch magazine

latters pockets were filled with artificial
eggs

  half an hour later mr and mrs
john broads occupied prison cells ad-
joining that of the grocer

  then no  sat down and wrote a
message which although it was in ci-
pher was so long that it filled three
telegram blanks this message was ad-
dressed to the superintendent of the
united states secret service office at
seattle washington

chapter xi

just in time

in spite of the failure of his egg fac-
 tory mr rudolph gallatin did not
hesitate to urge spokane wahman to
marry him

  even though my scheme has fallen
through he pleaded i am well able to
support a wife in luxury this egg
venture was only one of many irons i
have in the fire making money comes
as easy to me as rolling off a log if
you are afraid that youll starve if you
marry me little girl i can reassure you
by showing you bank books containing
deposits of a couple of hundred thou-
sand dollars in my name and in addi-
tion to that money i can draw on my
wall street friends to any amount up
to a million so please dont turn me
down spokane just because this little
egg affair of mine has failed i am a
man of ideas and with a wife like you
for an inspiration it wont be long be-
fore ill be ranked among this countrys
great multimillionaires

  it isnt the money the girl replied
i wouldnt be afraid to face the future
with you even if you were penniless
for i am confident that a man of your
ability can always make a living but
i am not quite sure that i care for you
enough to marry you you have been so
deceitful about this egg business even
though you have done nothing legally
wrong ever since you have been in
walla walla you have been acting one
big lie and i cant bear a person who
tells lies

  lies are necessary in business he
replied a broad-minded girl like you

spokane ought to realize that in these
days it isnt possible to make a big for-
tune without deceiving the public
but i cant help thinking that a
man who would deceive the public
would also deceive his wife she de-
clared severely now an honest fel-
low like larry bradley-

  bosh gallatin interrupted her
with a contemptuous gesture dont
tell me spokane that you are hesitating
about marrying me on account of that
young piker a girl like you is much
too fine for a barbers bride you were
born to be the wife of a multimillion-
aire little one and thats what youre
going to be if youll become mrs ru-
dolph gallatin

  in justice to spokane it must be said
that it was not so much this alluring
prospect as it was the fascinating per-
sonality of gallatin which caused her
to weaken it was difficult for a woman
to withstand the influence of those won-
derful dreamy eyes of his and the al-
most hypnotic suasion of his voice

  give me a few days to think it
over she said

  i cant ive got to leave walla
walla to-night the collapse of my egg
enterprise compels me to return to new
york immediately to attend to some im-
portant business matters there and
when i leave little girl i want to take
you with me think what a fine honey-
moon trip it will be

  but i must have a few hours at
least to make up my mind spokane
insisted come around to the house
this evening and ill let you know
very well assented gallatin but
to save time lets go now and get the
license and the ring that wont bind
you of course in case you decide to
turn me down another thing instead
of my calling at the house this evening
to learn my fate suppose we meet out-
side the egg factory at seven oclock i
dont think it would be advisable to take
your uncle and aunt into our confidence
think how much more romantic it will
be to run off and get married and then
send them a telegram from new york
informing them that you are mrs ru-
dolph gallatin
winged in walla walla



  at seven oclock that evening larry
bradley happening to walk through
catherine street saw spokane meet
gallatin outside the latters place of
business and shadowed the couple to
the home of a local parson being a
young man of average intelligence he
did not suppose that the couple was vis-
iting the dominie to discuss theology
he strongly suspected that matrimony
was the object of their call although
his soul was harrowed by the thought
he could not for the life of him see how
he was going to prevent the knot from
being tied he knew that it would be
quite useless to appeal to spokane he
feared too that it would be equally
futile to inform chris wahman for al
though he surmised that it was an elope-
ment he knew that spokane being of
legal age her uncle would be powerless
to stop the marriage even if desirous of
doing so

  nevertheless he decided to adopt the
latter course it seemed to be the only
thing that he could do he told himself
that while chris had no legal rights in
the matter he might be able to per-
suade the parson to refuse to perform
the marriage

  larry was hurrying in the direction
of his employers house the gloomiest
young man in the walla walla valley
when he encountered chief of police
mike davis the latter was accom-
panied by a keen-looking man who was
a stranger to larry

  hello exclaimed davis seen
anything of that fellow gallatin lately 

  the tone in which he asked the ques-
tion caused a sudden ray of hope to
shoot through larrys heart

  yes i saw him a few minutes ago
he answered eagerly i know where
he is now do you want him

  do we want him exclaimed the
chief of police excitedly lead us to
him just as quick as you can young
feller

  as they hurried toward the parson-
age davis introduced his companion to
larry and explained briefly why they
were so eager to find the artificial-egg
man

  meanwhile gallatin and spokane

were sitting on a horsehair sofa in the
ministers parlor impatiently waiting
for the parson who was detained up-
stairs by a visitor

  at length the reverend gentleman
came into the room smiling and rub-
bing the palms of his hands together
a mannerism often seen on the stage
but rarely affected by wearers of the
cloth in real life

  good evening young people he
greeted them sorry to keep you
waiting so long however as the say-
ing is better late than never i un-
derstand that you wish to be married 
if you please parson said galla-
tin and youd be doing us a great
favor if youd rush the ceremony
through as much as possible we have
to catch a train

  just as the minister was turning the
leaves of his prayer-book there was i
ring at his doorbell and a moment later
three men brushing past the astonished
maid entered the house and marched
into the parlor

  the trio of course consisted of
larry bradley chief davis and the
latters keen-looking companion

  i hope were in time cried larry
anxiously not being able to tell from
the attitude of the group whether the
ceremony was just beginning or just
coming to a close spokane for
heavens sake dont tell me that youre
already married

  not yet but ve will be in a min-
ute the girl replied icily if you
have come with the idea of stopping us
mr bradley you might as well go
right out again

  thank goodness we are in time
muttered larry reverently spokane
youre not going to marry this rascal
you dont know what he is hes a
crook of the worst order that fake

egg factory of his-

  oh whats the use of bringing that
up again the girl interrupted really
larry bradley your jealousy is mak-
ing you ridiculous mr gallatin is not
a crook his scheme was perfectly
legitimate you know very well what
his motive was for pretending that he
could make eggs by machinery


top-notch magazine

  yes i know what his motive was
but you dont the young man declared
tensely he turned to chief davis
companion mr glover wont you
please tell her who you are and what
youre here for

  mr glover edged nearer to gallatin
im a federal officer miss he an-
nounced ive come to arrest this
man

  hearing this gallatin shifted his feet
and looked longingly toward the door
but he made no further move he
noted that glovers right hand was
thrust in the side pocket of his coat
and although he could not see it he
knew that the hand held a revolver the
barrel of which was pointed toward
him he knew moreover that the fed-
eral officer could shoot in that position
without drawing

  but wdiats the charge spokane
gasped surely mr gallatin was not
breaking any law by running the egg
factory

  im afraid he was glover replied
dryly counterfeiting is regarded by
the united states government as a very
serious crime my young woman
counterfeiting cried spokane in-
dignantly what nonsense  do you
mean to say that its counterfeiting to
make imitation eggs

  it all depends upon wrhats in the
eggs the secret-service man answered
her when the imitation eggfe contain
imitation ten-dollar gold pieces it isnt
exactly the pure-food law which has
been violated

chapter xii

a hint from gallatin

cpokane stared at the secret-serv-
 ice officer in incredulous astonish-
ment but mr gallatins eggs did not
contain imitation ten-dollar gold
pieces she protested theydidnt
contain anything except eggs they
were just ordinary eggs covered with
plaster

  some of them were glover cor-
rected her with a deprecating smile
but some were just hollow plaster

shells in each of which he and his con-
federates placed a remarkably good
imitation of a ten-dollar gold piece
packed in cotton isnt that so galla-
tin 	

  the egg man shrugged his shoulders
if you are so sure why ask me he
sneered turning his head slightly so as
to avoid the girls eyes i suppose
youve located the plant

  sure the secret-service man in-
formed him and weve got your two
confederates locked up at police head-
quarters too they had the stuff all
packed and we nabbed them down in
the cellar just as they were starting to
carry it away

  the cellar cried spokane was
the counterfeiting plant down in the cel-
lar of the egg factory 

  glover nodded affirmatively

  then that accounts for the queer
rumbling noise i heard so often said
the girl looking reproachfully at galla-
tin who still studiously avoided her
eyes

  this remark appeared to interest the
secret-service man were you often
at the egg factory miss he inquired

  yes i-i was employed there as
mr gallatins stenographer the girl
answered a pathetic break in her voice

  under those circumstances said
glover turning regretfully to chief of
police davis im afraid well have to
take her too

  dont do that gallatin pleaded
she had nothing whatever to do with
the scheme ill make affidavit to that
she took the job under the impression
that i was running an honest business
she didnt have the slightest idea what
was going on in the cellar i was al-
ways very careful to keep her from
catching on

  then why did you hire her glover
demanded incredulously it doesnt
seem plausible that if she wasnt in on
the plot youd have run the risk of hav-
ing her around the place

  there were several reasons the
egg man explained in the first place
i had to have somebody to take care of
the mass of correspondence that poured
winged in walla walla



into the egg factory i was afraid that
if i ignored all those letters and tele-
grams it would soon arouse suspicion
in the second place i figured that if i
employed a young woman well known
in walla walla it would lend an air of
respectability to my egg factory and
in the third place-gallatin waved his
hand toward the parson and smiled bit-
terly-well i think the fact that we
are here now will suggest to you what
the third reason was i beg of you not
to arrest the girl she is absolutely
innocent

  chief davis and larry bradley also
interceded for spokane both of them
assuring the secret-service agent that
they knew her to be a young woman
of exemplary character

  all right said glover at length
well give her the benefit of the doubt
we may need you later on though
miss as a witness against this counter-
feiting gang youll be willing to
testify

  if the government calls on me i
suppose ill have to the girl answered
with a sigh i dont think though
that my testimony would be of much
value as rud-mr gallatin-has
told you he did not take me into his
confidence he never breathed a word
to me that might have caused me to
suspect he was a counterfeiter in
fact she added glancing sadly toward
the egg man i can scarcely believe
even now that it is true it doesnt
seem reasonable that a gang of coun-
terfeiters would deliberately attract the
attention of the whole world toward
themselves by making the startling
claim that they could manufacture eggs
i cant imagine a man of mr gallatins
intelligence doing anything so foolish

  foolish glover repeated with a
laugh gallatin is about as foolish as
a fox his bid for notoriety was the
slickest part of the whole scheme he
was wise enough to realize that it is the
criminal who shuns attention who is
the quickest discovered the crook
who works with a brass-band ac-
companiment-figuratively speaking-
stands much more chance of getting
away with it his neighbors are so

busy listening to the band that they
dont pay any attention to what hes
doing

  chief mike davis nodded his ap-
proval of this figure of speech sure
he acquiesced now if gallatin had
come to walla walla and pretended to
engage in some ordinary business the
chances are that  would have spotted
that counterfeiting plant right off for
i was suspicious of his looks and ways
from the first day he struck town but
when he claimed that he was going to
make eggs by machine i naturally as-
sumed that the swindle he was going to
pull off would be along those lines con-
sequently it did not occur to me to be
on the watch for an entirely different
crime

  besides which said the secret-
service man looking half admiringly at
gallatin those artificial eggs came in
mighty handy as a means for distribut-
ing the coins by shipping the counter-
feits disguised as eggs to his agents in
other cities gallatin himself was run-
ning a minimum chance of being caught
he figured that even if any of his con-
federates were nabbed while trying to
pass the counterfeit ten-dollar pieces
the authorities would have hard work
locating the source of supply-that they
would not think of looking inside the
eggs

  altogether he added it was a
mighty clever scheme-one of the slick-
est and best organized we have ever
been up against it is a good thing for
uncle sam that weve got this gang
rounded up in another few weeks
theyd have had the country flooded
with counterfeit money

  then he slipped the handcuffs on mr
rudolph gallatin and led him from the
room chief davis went along to see
that the secret-service man and his cap-
tive arrived safely at the local jail but
spokane and larry bradley remained
behind in the clergymans parlor the
girl was weeping pitifully the young
man deemed it his duty to stay and
comfort her

  spokane he whispered gently
ive got some big news to tell you
this afternoon i bought one of the


top-notch magazine

grandest little chicken farms in the
walla walla valley theres five
dozen plymouth rocks and three dozen
rhode island reds and a whole lot of
little chicks from four to eight weeks
old and the house spokane you
ought to see the house its the cutest
coziest little bungalow cottage you ever
saw i know youll be tickled to death
with it

  will i  cried spokane smiling
through her tears im so glad that
youve been able to fulfill your ambi-
tion at last-r-that is of course im glad
on your account but larry how did
you manage to raise the money to buy
the farm

 larry bradley chuckled it was
that fellow gallatin who gave me the
hint-although of course he didnt in-
tend to do so when i heard him tell
that fairy story about trying to corner
the worlds market in chickens it sug-
gested an idea to me i went and saw
the man who owns this chicken farm i
offered him half the price he wanted
for the place and i told him that i
would pay on the installment plan he
accepted my proposition eagerly he
was glad to sell at any sacrifice larry
chuckled again you see spokane he
hadnt heard of the collapse of the egg
factory and he was scared blue by
gallatins artificial eggs

the din of battle
phe sounds of a battle can be heard far beyond the scene of actual strife

    the reports of the guns themselves go far out into space and can be dis-
tinguished a long way from the point of conflict

     professor w f sinclair says that there is nothing unusual in the hearing
of artillery at a distance of sixty miles the bombay time guns and salutes are
often heard at the northern mahim a distance of over fifty miles the guns
are-or were at the time when the observations were made-very modest affairs
old-fashioned twenty-four or thirty-two pounders loaded with four or five pounds
of coarse black powder not all of which was burnt

     the target practice of the forts and turret ships at bombay was easily dis-
tinguishable froip mere salutes and time guns not merely as a louder sound but
by being felt in the chest when the others could only be heard

    the sound produced by modern powder is probably very different from that
of the old black powder so that an arm in action at the present time may
be relied upon to make its voice heard the din of battle is not a figure
of speech

                     distinguished bxamples
hen charged with being drunk and disorderly and asked what he had
 to say for himself the prisoner gazed pensively at the magistrate smoothed
down a remnant of gray hair and said

    your honor mans inhumanity to man makes countless thousands mourn
im not as debased as swift as profligate as byron as dissipated as poe as
debauched as-

    that will do thundered the magistrate ten davs and officer take
a list of those names and run em in theyre as bad a lot as he is

roger boltwood a yale student
after many dare-devil escapades with
more or less reckless companions is involved
in a serious automobile accident which al-
though he escapes with slight injuries proves
disastrous for him in the unpleasant publicity
which it brings to him and his father henry
boltwood the automobile manufacturer
roger expects the incident to close with a
stern reprimand from his father but is
amazed to find himself suddenly turned out
of his home to shift for himself

  boltwood hires a small lodging in harlem
and seeks some occupation for the summer
months but finds unexpected difficulties con-
stantly arising to balk him he has kept his
motor cycle and he starts out early one
morning to ride to bayside long island to
seek the advice of an old friend on a lonely
country road he comes suddenly upon a
stalled automobile an elderly man sitting
in the car stops him and asks him to help
him start the car boltwood recognizes the
man as cyrus keating the manufacturer of
the keating kar his fathers bitter busi-
ness rival and the father of tom keating
a yale man whose enmity boltwood incurred
in a quarrel over a card game

 boltwood shows his knowledge of motor
cars in the manner in which he repairs keat-
ings car and the elderly man tells him that
if he will drive the car to dempford for
him he may give him a job as a chauffeur

 on the way to dempford boltwood beats
a ranco racing car in an impromptu road
race and wins the admiration of cyrus keat-
ing keating tells him of his fears that
there is a conspiracy to make the keating
racer lose the race for the traymore cup

and boltwood proposes that he employ him
as driver in the race he confesses that he
is the son of keatings business rival henry
boltwood and keating declares that he
would not dare employ him despite the fact
that boltwoods father has disowned him

  on arriving at the keating garage at
dempford near the race course they find
things in suspicious condition and keating
discharges his driver and the entire staff of
assistants the disgruntled employees attack
keating but boltwood routs them and wins
the manufacturers gratitude and friendship
despite the angry protests of his son tom
keating offers boltwood the position of
driver in the race and six hundred dollars if
he wins

  matt shea a mechanician is assigned to
accompany boltwood in the race and all
preparations are made when henry bolt-
wood arrives at the keating garage and for-
bids his son to drive for keating keating
angrily accuses the elder boltwood of foul
play in trying to fix the race and roger
boltwood announces that he has that day
become of age and that he will drive the
keating car in spite of any protests

chapter xvi
tragedys dark wing

he hour had come the min-
ute had arrived the big
keating racer had been trun-
dled out into the open and a
man stood ready at the start-
ing crank roger boltwood in leather
garments helmet and goggles was pull-
ing on his gloves preparatory to taking


top-notch magazine

his position at the wheel the main
stand at the starting and finishing line
was loaded to its utmost capacity with
excited human beings who now seemed
hushed for the moment with a sort of
breathless tenseness

  cyrus keating standing near roger
pulled out his split-second watch and
looked at it the ranco has first posi-
tion he said theyll send her off in
half a minute

  the firing of a manifold-denuded
motor came to their ears

  powers gripped rogers elbow and
slapped him on the back remember
what ive told ou old chap he said
you wont have to worry about any
cars except the comet and the ranco
dont let any one crowd you on the
bayville double curve and watch your
skidding on the turn beyond chester-
brook bridge something will happen
there to the first careless driver who
takes the turn at high speed now go
out there and eat em up

  the report of a pistol came from the
starting point and instantly the roar
of the rancos cylinders burst upon the
ear like the firing of a machine gun it
was answered by a tremendous roar of
human voices sufficient to thrill a
mummy that roar ran away into the
distance as the ranco shot down the
long straight stretch from the starting
line

  five minutes yet said cyrus keat-
ing then your turn comes son
roger was as cool as an early april
morning not by a single tremor
action or word did he betray any strain
upon his nerves listening he heard
the second pistol shot which sent the
silent hood barking away on the trail
of the ranco

  the comet goes next he said
shes running out now myers will be
the man to beat in this race as far as
drivers are concerned fie doesnt know
what fear means

  the comet was off on the moment
then followed the morgan and the
prince while the crowd thundered its
encouragement to the driver of the fifth
car the keating started forth to take its
position never in all his remembrance

had roger bolt wood felt more elated
more filled to the brim with the joy of
life yet his apparent calmness amazed
even the mechanician at his side

  the hoarsely shouting spectators
grew silent as they surveyed the youth-
ful driver of the car that had rolled
into position for the start from out
of that silence came from somewhere a
voice roger could not mistake

  youre der candy kid bolt go
after dat bunch of lemons and put em
to der mat

  suggs thought roger ready to let
in his clutch ready to punch open the
accelerator suggs the pug-a real
man	

  the starters hand went up the sun
glittering on the pistol roger meshed
his gears and was ready for instant
action the pistol spoke and the grip
of the clutch let in instantly caused the
keating to jump forward its cylinders
spitting fire with a sudden tremendous
roar with a double movement roger
went through the gears into direct drive
and reached racing speed thirty seconds
after leaving the line such a leap into
action was of course a tremendous
strain on the car but the keating had
been built for just such treatment and
nothing gave way it was afterward
remarked by many spectators who
watched boltwoods get off that no
racing driver with years of experience
had ever done the trick with more un-
faltering certainty or in handsomer
style down the long straight road
shining black with oil the roaring
throbbing racer went tearing in pursuit
of its valiant rivals

  trees fences houses and lines of
shouting people seemed rushing back-
ward on either hand there was some
vibration to tell that the blazing engine
was doing its work with a full high
flood of life but the sensation quickly
became that of skimming along above
the road and barely touching it now and
then a tremendous wind rose and
beat into the faces of boltwood and
shea the miles were put behind them
at the speed of the fastest express train

  first came the chesterbrook bridge
with the dangerous curve beyond it and
boetwood of yale

lit

shea preparing to throw his body far
out as a balance weight wondered if
they would take that curve or go tear-
ing through the fence on the outer side
to climb the bank beyond

  the bridge gave back a roop as
they shot over it they were on the
curve and the mechanician holding
fast and thrusting himself far toward
the inner side of the road realized that
they skidded

  how to skid at great speed without a
spill or a smash is an art which every
racing driver must acquire he must
be prepared to do the right thing when
he skids at unexpected times and he
must look forward to almost certain
skids at known places on the ordinary
course roger had expected to skid on
that turn and therefore he was fully
prepared when the thing happened a
driver of less skill hitting the spot at a
speed not exceeding fifty miles an hour
would doubtless have whirled complete-
ly round and found himself heading
the other way or if less lucky would
have side-swiped the fence and turned
turtle when neither of these things
happened shea swinging back to his
seat felt his confidence in bolt wood rise
one hundred per cent

  good work there thought shea ex-
ultantly the old man said he could
drive im beginning to believe it if
he makes the bayville double without
accident this time ill be ready to ride
with him through anything

  almost before they realized it they
were ripping through the roped-off and
guarded main street of a little town
upon which during the time of the race
no vehicle of any sort save the racing
cars would be permitted the open
windows of the houses were choked
with human beings hanging out and
shrieking at them other human beings
had found places of vantage on roofs
and in trees telephone poles bore peo-
ple clinging like leeches to the iron
climbing spikes

  in a twinkling they were again in the
open country then came the bayville
double curve where shea threw the
weight of his body first to one side then
to the other as far as he could with-

out interfering with the driver to the
mechanicians astonishment and ad-
miration they scarcely seemed to skid
at all as they made that s-like twist

  youre the goods old man shouted
shea his voice unheard by roger above
the roaring of the motor and the shriek
of the air let her go and shea
was regarded by those who knew him
well as a cold-blooded unemotional
irishman something of a human para-
dox

  forty miles they covered and came
tearing like a tornado over the starting
line for the second round of the course
without even glimpsing any other car
behind them two more racers had start-
ed but roger did not fear that either
the echo or the calvin would overtake
him the prince was ahead having
got off only one minute in advance of
the keating and in that forty miles the
latter had not overtaken no 

  on the second lap boltwood went out
with the intention of setting the prince
back a notch before he came round
again suddenly as they swooped
through a small grove and almost
bounded over a tiny hill roger saw the
car he was after it seemed almost
that the keating saw the other racer
for it spurted as a mettlesome horse
spurts upon a track in short order
boltwood could taste the light dust
picked up by the whirling wheels of the
prince into it he forged and along-
side just before chesterbrook bridge
was reached the prince dropped be-
hind

  one of em counted shea four
more to get well get em

  they took the curve beyond the
bridge even better than they had on the
first lap and roger went out in search
of no  the morgan just before en-
tering the little village they roared past
the morgan held up by tire trouble

  now its the comet yelled shea
the words torn from his lips by what
seemed to be a raging wind

  the comet roger knew the comet
had got away in third position and he
felt a deep thrill of joy as he yearned
for the struggle that should decide
whether the comet or the keating had

the most speed at every opportunity
when he dared lift his eyes on a straight
stretch he looked for the comet but
not until they had entered the last ten
miles of the second lap was he rewarded
by perceiving a little swirl of dust and
the rear end of a flying car

  shea worked the oil pump get
her  he shrieked all his reputed stolid-
ness swept away by the blood-firing
thrill of it

  it was fairly in front of the packed
main stands that roger fought it out
with the other car at the starting line
they were practically side by side and
the shrieking goggle-eyed multitude of
human beings went crazy with enthusi-
asm

  got you was rogers muffled cry
as he perceived that the keating was
creeping into the lead despite every ef-
fort of its rival this settles the ques-
tion as far as youre concerned barring
accidents

  but when he had forged past shea
leaned close and yelled into his ear
the hood-the silent hood

  it was not the comet after all in
that eighty miles the comet had passed
car no  the silent hood and was
now in second position unless it had
passed the ranco also

  before they again arrived at chester-
brook bridge they came crawling up on
three other cars which were bunched
in a remarkable manner-crawling up
at a speed of more than seventy miles
an hour two of the cars were fight-
ing it out like demons while the third
hung on close behind that third
roger perceived was the calvin which
starting as no  had therefore fallen
back in the race just now however
the calvin was sticking to the two lead-
ers in a way that proved her to possess
speed if nothing else

  over the bridge they leaped and the
keating engaged the calvin on one of
the most dangerous places of the course
the slippery curve

  the calvin had the inside and roger
attempted to shoot past they struck
the curve and in a twinkling the cal-
vin was forcing the keating up against
the outside fence

  catastrophe rose and grinned dis-
aster reached out its deadly hand for
boltwood and shea

  roger was forced to shut off all
power for he dared not apply the
brakes the calvin skidded across with
her rear wheels missing the front
wheels of the keating by barely a foot

  shea swore roundly not a sound
came from boltwoods lips but his jaws
were set with the muscles standing out
taut and hard upon them

  having foiled the keatings attempt
to pass at that curve the calvin shot
ahead and opened up the distance be-
tween them roger took after it and
did his best to get by before the bay-
ville double curve was reached he
gained a little steadily but far too
slowly to accomplish his purpose and
almost together after swooping through
mapleton they entered the double
curve

  here again tragedy hovered and
threatened here again the calvin-
without skidding this time-forced
boltwood to relax a little or be
smashed even while his mind and his
hands were occupied in handling the
powerful racer boltwood thought of
something that added to the boiling heat
of his blood

  inadvertently a week or two before
leaving home he had become aware of
a fact carefully hidden from the gen-
eral public he had learned that nego-
tiations were being made quietly for a
consolidation of the comet and the cal-
vin concerns the comet had a car of
both stamina and speed the calvin had
speed but had never stood up under
abuse roger had wondered why his
father cared to make such a consolida-
tion but now recalling the statement of
cyrus keating that the comet motor
car company  needed more capital a
sudden light dawned upon him the
people behind the calvin concern were
powerful in the financial world and a
consolidation with them would bring to
henry boltwood and his associates all
the ready money they could possibly re-
quire

  still thought roger i dont want
to believe that my father would be con-
bolt wood of yale



cerned in any arrangement by which the
calvin would foul the keating to give
the comet a better chance to win this
race he wouldnt do it but christy
-christy might

  like a bulldog he had hung close to
the calvin through the double curve
beyond it he saw his opportunity the
troublesome car seeking to bother him
had forged to the outside of the course
the inside was opened wide and into
the gap roger drove the keating forc-
ing her to the last notch before the
calvin driver was aware of it the keat-
ing was alongside

  that settled it the calvin held on
for a few minutes but found it impos-
sible to keep up the pace slowly she
dropped behind

  the ranco and the comet were still
fighting it out only a short distance
ahead suddenly the ranco wabbled
and its pace slackened a tire had
blown out and as the ranco stopped
for repairs the comet went flying into
the lead

  youll be eating my dust inside of
twenty miles at most decided roger

the awful hazard

the speed-mad thousands were
 howling like lunatics as the two
mighty racing cars fought it out past
the main stands and went thundering
into the long straight stretch beyond
whatever could be said of myers who
drove the comet he was at least an
honest racer writh no desire to win at
the cost of a rivals life he had a
slight advantage but he gave the keat-
ing every chance upon that stretch

  for a time it did not seem that roger
could pass but he knew he must pass
before the chesterbrook curve was
reached or drop behind delicately and
with the highest and rarest sort of
judgment he manipulated spark and
throttle a hair only a hair of change
then he saw that he was gaining myers
tried for more speed and failed when
shea attempted to shout for joy the
crv was driven back into his throat by
a

the rushing wind little by little the
keating crept past a foot a yard two
yards she forged into the lead when
chesterbrook bridge was reached she
had two good car lengths

  they struck the curve too hard but
boltwroods steady nerves and wonder-
ful judgment saved them and they left
it behind still on their wheels with
everything working perfectly roger
knew he had first position the task was
now to hold it

  on the second sweep of the bayville
double curve he caught a glimpse of the
first tragedy of the day the echo was
piled up at the roadside having left the
course cut down a tree and wrapped
itself in shattered fragments around an-
other a crowd had gathered around
it and some foolish ones were on the
road but roger got past without hit-
ting any one

  not until the race was over did he
learn that the echos driver had been
instantly killed while the mechanician
had marvelously escaped with only a
few scratches

  like a man of iron boltwood drove
wondering if anything would happen to
the keating and beginning to believe
that nothing would he lost all track
of the laps and not until he again came
upon the calvin was he bothered

  this time the driver of the calvin
proved his foulness as well as his folly
by crowding boltwood on an open
stretch the thing was done wretched-
ly and roger was forced in a moment
to the very border of the road with his
opponent still pushing him over

  there was an opening between some
trees and as his only chance boltwood
left the course and shot into it for a
few seconds he was on grass ground
but behind him something had hap-
pened  and twisting he wheeled sharp-
ly to the left flashed back across the
narrow ditch and regained the road-
way

  yes something had happened behind
him the treacherous driver of the
calvin had misjudged the course in his
mad effort to put the keating out of the
running roger had saved himself but
the calvin deflected perhaps by some


top-notch magazine

trivial thing found no clear road when
it shot off the course a tree trunk tore
away one of the wheels and the car
went bottom up

  there is a saying that satan protects
his own in this case the calvin driver
was thrown clear of the wreckage and
simply stunned the mechanician part-
ly caught beneath the overturned racer
sustained a broken leg

  to boltwood many hours seemed to
pass and still he roared on round and
round that forty-mile course he was
covered with dirt and grime until his
most intimate acquaintances could not
have recognized him nevertheless not
for a fleeting breath did his nerve falter
his eye fail or his steady hands relax

  but he was not to get through with-
out misfortune of any sort suddenly
he realized that the car was misfiring in
one cylinder at least it was necessary
to do something and he threw the
clutch and crowded on the brakes

  plug screamed shea plug trou-
ble ill guarantee

  they leaped out the troublesome
cylinder was located in a twinkling and
in another twinkling shea was twisting
out the plug to replace it with a dupli-
cate

  in that brief time roger took a quick
look at the tires good lord he
groaned the rear left-hand shoe is
half flat its going down weve got
a puncture shea

  they had ripped the shoe off found
the cause of lost inflation and were put-
ting on another tire when the comet
thundered past them and went blazing
triumphantly into the distance neither
spoke the shoe was made ready and
they leaped back into their positions
the engine fired perfectly when started
showing that shea had properly diag-
nosed the trouble

  now yelled the irishman as he
worked the oil pump get after the
comet again weve got to trim her
we will said roger

  the ranco came threatening up be-
hind them before they could get under
the highest headway but while giving
the challenger every fair chance roger
simply declined to let it go by they

swooped past other cars limping and
helplessly beaten the race for first
position as the wise ones had predicted
was now wholly between the ranco the
keating and the comet

  true the comet was again leading
but it had started three minutes ahead
of the keating and roger felt confi-
dent if no further accident happened to
his car that the machine of the bolt-
wood company could not come any-
where near finishing sufficiently far in
advance to take first place the ranco
with six minutes to make up seemed to
be relegated to third position

  but roger had no intention if he
could prevent it of allowing the comet
to finish first even though it should fail
to do so by the necessary lead of three
minutes time he was driving like a
fiend as they raged past the main stand
and there shea catching the signal
managed to make him understand that
they had entered the last lap of the race

  there were forty miles in which to
overtake and pass the comet

  in the straight stretches roger
pushed the keating to its last hair
notch and on the curves he let up just
barely enough to take them without
smashing yet his judgment and skill
were such that by an eyelash flicker he
held to the margin of safety

  shea swayed his body outward as a
balance weight and pumped oil by
turns not even when they came bel-
lowing out of the bayville double and
caught the comets dust did the irish-
man betray excitement it seemed that
he had worked off his emotions in the
earlier stages of the great struggle and
now he like boltwood seemed a mere
mechanical part of the throbbing racer

  less than nineteen miles lay before
them and the finishing line and the
keating handled magnificently was do-
ing its utmost for a time there was
nothing to indicate that they were gain-
ing but in the last five-mile stretch they
began to see through the dust the rear
of the comet nearer and still nearer
they forged but still it appeared that
the comet though beaten for the cup
would finish ahead of them

  neither boltwood nor shea knew
boltwood of yale

anything of the mad excitcment of the
spectators who watchcd them swoop
past like a tornado in the effort to cut
the comet down they were watching
the gas tank of the rival car and seeing
it slowly-oh so slowly-become
plainer and more distinct through the
veil of dust

  less than a quarter of a mile from
the finishing point the comet threw a
forward shoe it wabbled writhed
bucked went over

  all the guards at that point of the
course were insufficient to restrain some
of the madly excited spectators who
immediately leaped out upon the track
with the keating thundering down upon
them roger saw the movement and
refused to throttle down hoping to get
past before any human being could put
himself in peril of being dashed into
eternity

  then suddenly he saw a man rush
toward one of the two unfortunate hu-
man beings who had been thrown
sprawling to the roadway by the over-
turned comet it was his father-his
own father-in the path of death
there was a sharp instantaneous
movement of rogers steady hands
upon the wheel a perilous swerve of the
racer another swerve that brought it
back to the course-and on it went

  thank god breathed roger husk-
ily his face ghastly pale beneath its
caking coat of oil and grime

  over the line he shot deaf to the
mighty plaudits of the leaping multitude
hailing him as conqueror from the
stands

chapter xviii

the goal in sight

xhen roger brought the panting
 racer to a stop shea remained
calm and almost withouta symptom of
emotion he said

  pretty good driving boltwood
looking back and seeing no other car
in sight roger turned as quickly as pos-
sible on the track taking the outer left-
hand side and driving toward the
stands his one thought at that mo-

ment was of his father and now lie
could feel the nerves quivering in every
part of his body

  one of the two limping racers they
had passed came hobbling over the fin-
ishing line unnoticed and unapplauded
then the voice of the announcer was
heard proclaiming through a huge
megaphone

  the keating kar boltwood driver
wins first position and the cup

  once more the great throngs of peo-
ple sent up a mighty shout those in
the stands beheld roger approaching
and leaning toward him with out-
stretched arms and flushed faces they
gave him the ovation of a conquering
gladiator he did not seem either to
see or hear them he was thinking of
what had happened to the comet and
how by an almost infinitesimal mar-
gin he had avoided killing his own
father

  all along the front of the stands as
he rode close to give a clear road for
any other racing cars that might come
up the crowd bellowed and surged and
shouted when he passed about him
torn from the throbbing bosoms of
hundreds of ladies falling upon his
dust-covered shoulders in a perfect
storm rained bouquets of flowers fie
had passed the stands when from out
of the subsiding tumult the voice of the
announcer again reached his ears
neither the driver nor the mechani-
cian of the comet is seriously hurt
from somewhere powers his face
glowing bobbed up and leaped upon
the keating seizing roger and giving
him a tremendous hug

  finest race ever driven he cried
youve won the cup old fellow-
youve won the cup

  have you seen anything of my fa-
ther asked roger do you know if
he is all right he must have been
crazy to rush out onto the track when
myers had that spill i nearly killed
him

  nobody was hurt assured powers
why myers wasnt even stunned
his mechanician is cut up some but he
was on his feet and able to stand in no
time at all myers heart is broken he

 was crying like a baby when they car-
 ried him off

   he drove a fair and honest race
which is more than i can say for one
other driver at least said boltwood

   the guards had surrounded the car
to keep the crowd from pulling roger
out of it in their hero-worshiping mad-
ness and thus protected he turned
from the course and drove slowly to the
garage

  cyrus keating was waiting there
panting a little from his haste to reach
it ahead of roger he grasped bolt-
woods hand as the young man stepped
out of the conquering machine

   boy he said youre one of the
finest drivers in the world nobody
who saw you drive to-day will dispute
it

  thank you mr keating said
 roger almost listlessly i tried to do
my best and that was all i could do

   youre tired youre pale youre
done up i dont wonder you must
rest at once

   i dont need rest said roger i
 need just a little time to recover from
 what happened after the comet turned
 over

   you had the comet beaten anyhow
when you passed for the last lap i
knew youd win if no accident happened
to you

   we were fortunate said roger to
 have so little trouble we changed only
 one tire in the race and a bad plug held
 us up but a few minutes

   you had the car that was built to
win and with you driving it won in
spite of all the crooked schemes to beat
it

   roger had cast aside his gloves hel-
 met and goggles he felt stifled and
 he walked out of the garage to get air
 two rods away he saw his father pass-
 ing toward - the comet garage accom-
 panied by several other men instantly
 roger bounded forward

   father he cried father im so

slad-

   the words died on his lips and his
 outstretched hands sank slowly for
  henry boltwood had turned upon him
 a face so distorted by disappointment

and anger so repellent and accusing
that roger was stricken dumb for
twenty seconds perhaps the elder man
gazed with cold hard eyes straight at
his son then without a word he
walked on with his associates

  rogers splendid shoulders drooped
he shouldnt feel that way toward
me he muttered huskily it isnt
right

  he was standing thus when a beau-
tiful girl who had witnessed the rebuff
her face flushed her eyes full of min-
gled sympathy and admiration came up
quickly and placed her gloved hand on
his arm

  you drove a splendid race mr bolt-
wood she said her voice thrilling him
when even the plaudits of the multitude
had failed but i feared youd be
killed and i prayed-i prayed that you
might not

  the color came back into his own
face showing through the mottled
splotches of grime and dirt there was
a slight tremor in his voice as he
brushed back a lock of hair from his
broad forehead and answered her
laughingly

  it was very good of you to be so
interested in my performance miss
keating and the knowledge of it gives
me more pleasure than the winning of
the cup

  charlie randall was escorting her
and even he came up and shook rogers
hand it was some race old sport
he declared if ive ever said you
couldnt drive-in proper condition to
do so-ill eat my words

  there was perhaps the slightest
touch of malice and envy in this but
roger chose to ignore it and he
thanked randall quietly

  cyrus keating bubbling with satis-
faction and enthusiasm like a man
thirty years younger came from the
garage spoke to his daughter and
slapped a hand on rogers back

  the cup presentation will be made
at once in front of the main stand he
said the calvin the echo and the
comet all failed to finish and the
prince was disqualified the ranco
the morgan and the silent hood are
boltwood of yale



reported as following you in the order
named sheas ready get into the car
and go out there to receive the cup
it will be all over then i hope said
roger this will be the hardest part
of the whole business

  all along the line people hailed him
as he drove out to take his position in
front of the main-stand box occupied
by the chief officers of the racing board
in a sort of trance he bowed his thanks
to the renewed thunders of applause
which greeted him

  next he realized that standing in the
front of the box almost within arms
reach of him maxwell traymore was
making the presentation speech the
cheering had ceased and gaping thou-
sands were straining their ears to hear
and their eyes to see a huge floral
piece fashioned to spell the words cup
winner inside a massive horseshoe
was passed out and received shea tak-
ing charge of it then after a few
more words came the cup the sight of
which set the people cheering again as
it was passed down

  the sound of their voices died away
and roger knowing what he must do
rose and replied with a few clear dis-
tinct modest words afterward to
save him he could not have repeated
even the gist of what he said but al-
ways he would vividly remember how
the scene around him seemed to fade
and melt and change until in that su-
preme moment of his triumph he ap-
peared to be looking upon an elm-
shaded campus surrounded by dormi-
tories with which he was familiar a
campus thronged with happy purpose-
ful students himself one of them back
again-back at yale

martin philbin

roger boltwood had hoped to
reenter new haven without en-
countering any of his former associates
he was beginning to congratulate him-
self on his luck in dodging the small
mob at the railway station waiting to
greet returning chums when he nearly
ran down little larry oleary

  careful careful expostulated the
beaming little irishman grabbing him
with both hands youre not driving
an automobile now and youve got to
have some consideration for pedestrians
when youre afoot say old man im
mighty glad to see you storrow con-
klin and bernfield are here already
you know somebody said something
about your not coming back i didnt
believe it i told them youd be here
with bells on

  im here smiled roger but ive
cut out the bells no big noise for
me

  smatter pop ive lately heard ru-
mors and hints at rumors but in these
degenerate modern days one can hear
anything except the silvery voice of
truth you know truth is said to lie
in the bottom of a deep well huh
its my opinion she was drowned long
ago it cant be that youre-

  it can be interrupted roger
promptly it is i am never mind
the harrowing details pardon me if i
shrink at displaying the hideous family
skeleton suffice it that im back here
sails close-hauled to the wind and evi-
dently a long-time passenger on the
good ship economy got to cut out
former giddy pleasures come to earth
and compass my course along the low-
lands

  youre jok g rog some duck
said youd actiily had to get out and
work said youd been forced to drive
a racing automobile for money i with-
ered the foolish mutt with my scorn

  next time youd better save your
scorn for legitimate use larry im

whole thing as a joke lemme con-
sider he said touching his temple with
the tip of his index finger now

last year in a night restaurant philbin
has handed me many a juicy hot dog
philbin is poor worthy persevering
and ambitious i believe hes come up a
trifle in fhe world this year dame
rumor hath whispered in my ear that
philbin has actually taken a couple of
rooms in lawrence doubtless hed be
willing to share those rooms and the ex-
penses with one roger boltwood late
high roller and general good fellow
forced to retrench and travel at a slow-
er pace because of heavy financial re-
verses oh say you and mart phil-
bin would make a hot team-you sure
would oleary finished by choking
with laughter over the mental picture
of roger boltwood and martin philbin
as roommates

  thank you larry said roger
quietly perhaps ill look this man
philbin up so long see you later

  as boltwood swung off up the street
carrying his grip larry stared after
him scratching his head in a puzzled
way he didnt take a cab thats
odd he didnt even take a street car
thats odder never knew him to walk
to save cab fare and as for doing it to
retain a miserable nickel in his jeans

-- oh blazes never he must be

needing exercise still boltwood
walking-for exercise tis passing
strange

  oleary would hb e been flabber-
gasted had he followed roger seen him
leave the hand bag with a friendly
cigar-counter clerk near the college
buildings and proceed from the cigar
store direct to lawrence where he
made inquiries for martin philbin
crossing the campus with a firm stride
roger cast just one sidelong glance to-
ward beautiful vanderbilt

  farewell he muttered with a grim
smile farewell to you and to all the
joyous follies that came into my life
with you

  a few of the early arrivals had gath-
ered in a little knot near the fence
where they were exchanging greetings
and gossip roger was aware that one
of the group called the attention of the
others to him and that nearly all of
them looked in his direction but by no

 outward symptom did he betray this
 knowledge

   at lawrence josh a colored man
 told him where to find martin philbin
 following directions he knocked at a
 door that wras standing slightly ajar
 thus permitting his ears distinctly to
 hear the softly whistled strains of
 annie laurie coming from the lips of
 some unseen person in the room

   the whistling stopped instantly
 come in called a voice

   roger pushed the door open and
 stood on the threshold facing a tall
 well-built somewhat spare young man
 who greeted him with a quizzical smile
 and an odd lifting of one eyebrow in
 a twinkling boltwood decided that he
 rather liked the chap

   are you martin philbin  he asked
 sure as death and taxes was the
 genial answer made in a pleasant musi-
 cal tone of voice im martin philbin
 but what the dickens roger boltwood
 wants of me i cant guess

   you know me then said roger
 stepping inside and surveying the rather
 poor study as well as glimpsing the un-
 curtained alcove bedroom

   philbin laughed showing his splendid
 teeth i reckon most everybody knows
 you around here couldnt very well
 help it you know for you were always
 getting into the limelight there he
 goes yes thats him rog bolt-
 wood old hen boltwoods son father
 reeks with money oh hes some
 spender believe me  and when he cuts
 loose-say give him a clear track f
 thats the way they talked so how was
 a man to help knowing you by sight
 boltwood

   rogers face burned thank you
 for the frank manner in which you
 have permitted me to see the light in
 which i was regarded philbin doubt-
 less there was reason its a good thing
 for somebody to hold the mirror up to
 a chap now and then youve taken
 these rooms have you

yes answered philbin proudly i
managed to sleep and exist when i had
to in a basement hole last year but no
more of that for me ive had a little
- streak of luck and now im going to try
boltwool of yale



to live like a gentleman and a student
even if my suite isnt located in van-
derbilt or some other swell dormitory
these rooms could be made fairly
comfortable said roger theyre
not so bad and you get a bit of sun in
the morning thats fine

  oh fll pick up some more things
now and then as i can afford it said
philbin i know i need rugs and
chairs and portieres and pictures and
some lace curtains at the windows
wouldnt be bad either but im no
millionaires son like you boltwood
and so i cant afford to do everything at
once

  ive got a load of stuff jin storage
that wouldnt go badly in these rooms
said roger ive got the curtains the
rugs the chairs and a corking good
study table not to mention pictures and
knickknacks what do you say if i
move in such truck of mine as will go
well here philbin

  again the young man lifted one eye-
brow in that odd manner at the same
time pursing his lips like one about to
whistle but remaining silent as he sur-
veyed the visitor with puzzled question-
ing eyes

  i couldnt begin to get all my truck
in here said roger and we wouldnt
need it either what we didnt need i
could sell perhaps to fellows who
might want it

  we breathed philbin what we
dont need  did i get you right bolt-
wood if i did whats the play if you
dont mind putting me wise 

  i thought said roger simply you
might like to have some one share these
rooms and the expenses with you thats
all

  three times philbin tried to speak
and he ended by dropping on a chair
and bursting into a shout of incredu-
lous almost derisive laughter

 go away boltwood he managed
to say at length limply waving roger
off you cant put anything like that
over on me you looking for a chance
to room with some poor slob in law-
rence  you the prince of high rollers
with a suite in vanderbilt then of
a sudden it seemed that he viewed the

matter in quite a different light which
promptly banished the mirth from his
face and voice rising he faced roger
throwing back his shoulders and mo-
tioning toward the door its a pretty
poor joke boltwood he said cutting-
lywhen a man of your caliber has to
seek his victim here you dont show
any indication that youve been drink-
ing but-

  wait a minute interrupted roger
quickly you quite misapprehend
philbin theres no joke about it im
in dead serious earnest no need to
give you particulars now ill do that
at some better time but ive found it
necessary within the last two months to
get out and hustle for myself that
means that ive not received a dollar or
an atom of assistance from my father
and im not looking for anything of the
sort it means that ive got to live
economically in order to get through
college and hearing of you by chance
ive come here to propose that we enter
into partnership its a sincere honest
offer what do you say 

  philbin stepped forward promptly
his slender shapely hand extended for
roger to grasp

  i say hooray he answered it
hits me as some fine proposition move
your belongings in as soon as you
please

old friends

it was not possible to use even a

	fourth of boltwoods furniture and
knickknacks in those two rooms at
lawrence a splendid turkish rug
practically hid the flooring and with
fine solid-looking easy-chairs and
rogers study table the aspect of the
place was soon changed then came
bookcases filled with books and pic-
tures and banners to adorn the walls
some beautiful portieres toning wdth
the turkish floor rug were hung to cut
off more than a glimpse of the bedroom
in which roger had two single beds set
up with the finest of hair mattresses
and everything to correspond

  with coat and collar peeled off his


top-notch magazine

shirt sleeves rolled up roger genuinely
enjoyed the work of putting the rooms
in order his enjoyment was deepened
by the enthusiasm and delight of phil-
bin who seemed literally transported by
his good fortune in acquiring such a
roommate

  say he exclaimed as he stood in
the middle of the study and gazed
around if the spirit of my dear old
aunt could take a peep in here now
shed be horrified by the belief that i
had begun to spend the little pot of
money she left me in riotous and reck-
less extravagance why i dont sup-
pose aunt henrietta ever saw a real
turkish rug in all her life but she
was some aunt boltwood believe me
she saved the pennies and the pennies
grew into dollars i was her favorite
nephew and just when things looked
blackest for me aunt henrietta up and
died and left me all she had

  roger willing to pause for a mo-
ment came and flung a leg over a cor-
ner of the study table

  so it was luck that brought you back
to yale phil well i had some luck
myself else id not be here

  yes it was luck said philbin a
shadow settling on his fine face i tell
you boltwood old man i dont believe
i could have stood another year of what
i had to go through as a freshman it
wasnt the work i dont mind work
it wasnt tending the furnaces in win-
ter but youll never know what i had
to stand for as waiter in that night
lunchroom

  i suppose some of the customers
were thoughtlessly insolent said rog-
er of course i know the kind of
chaps who roll into a place like that
after midnight lots of them have
their skins full and they dont know
what they are saying

  it wasnt that so much though of
course it got under my hide some but
boltwood the man who runs that res-
taurant is simply a beast and i had to
work for him or get out of college it
was the last and only thing i could find
to do to keep myself from starving
hard lines sure said roger sym-
pathetically ive never been up

against anything like that phil old
man i dont think i could quite stand
for it

  my people came from the south
murmured philbin with a short laugh
i was raised in ohio but my mother
was born in georgia shes an invalid
poor mother shes paralyzed and
cant even feed herself but her mind
is as active as ever and if she had ever
known what i was going through that
year in order to get an education it
would have driven her plumb crazy i
didnt even let my father suspect any-
thing like the real truth boltwood
hes a minister

  oh then youre a ministers son

  i am but i fear i dont live up to
the tradition ive never touched any
ofthe high places for i havent had the
chance and now im positive i
wouldnt have the inclination do you
know ive always had to be so con-
founded careful of the pennies that i
fear it has got into my blood even if
i should inherit a fortune to-day i dont
believe i could enjoy it as a man should
it would hurt me to spend money and
a man who cant enjoy spending has
no business to have more than he abso-
lutely needs for necessary expenses if
i seem to be penurious or mean some-
times bolt just make allowances for
me-will you old man

  you bet i will said roger ear-
nestly as he stepped forward and
placed a hand on his roommates shoul-
der you know one of the hardest
things in the world for me is to hold
onto money ive always had all i could
spend for anything i wanted and now
that conditions have changed as long
as i find a dollar down in my pocket i
have to fight not to blow it for the first
thing that strikes my fancy its really
a fight phil its got on my nerves a
bit too for sometimes i resent it be-
cause i cant buy anything i happen to
see and want your training old chap
has gone to one extreme and mine to
the other both of us should realize
that there is a happy medium and we
must try to find it

  as far as possible during the time
following his return to new haven and
boltwood of yale



the opening of the college term roger
avoided public places where he would
be likely to encounter any of his old
associates with philbin he ate at
commons knowing that there was lit-
tle chance that his professed friends of
last year would meet him there it was
impossible however to continue to
avoid them indefinitely and presently
he ran squarely into walter storrow
and irving conklin

  theres bolt-there he is now said
storrow in his solemn fashion
oleary was right hes here

  his face wreathed in smiles conklin
dashed forward and seized rogers
hand where the devil have you been
keeping yourself boltwood he splut-
tered youre not in vanderbilt
oleary said you came two days ago
but i thought he was lying fitzgerald
said you werent here-didnt believe
youd come at all

  what does fitzgerald know about
my plans asked roger probably
he got his pointers from tom keating
and i havent been letting keating into
my private business

  but where are you stopping where
are you going to room  questioned
storrow

  im rooming in lawrence

  conklin staggered and made a clutch
at the empty air while storrow seemed
a graven image of disbelief

  lawrence spluttered conklin
you rooming in lawrence tell it to
josephine

  theres no law to compel you to be-
lieve it said roger but if you want
to find me any time youll have to hunt
me up there im rooming with a man
named philbin

  in lawrence groaned storrow
oh how have the mighty fallen
come on urged conklin come
for a ball with us i need a bracer
after this where will we go
youll have to excuse me boys
said roger the same thing that
brought me up to lawrence has caused
me to cut out the joy juice no more
of that for me

  oh come come scoffed conklin

what are you trying to put across
rog it wont go with this bunch
here come bernfield and kilmer
said storrow theyve got their
blinkers on us

  the two approaching students came
up rapidly the blue eyes of the taller
man a curly-haired blond lighting with
an expression of pleasure at sight of
roger

  why how are you boltwood old
fel  he exclaimed grasping rogers
hand queer-but i was speaking of
you to kilmer just as we spied you
chinning with storrow and conklin
whats this guff oleary was telling
me about your taking rooms in law-
rence 

  no guff about it bernfield replied
roger unabashed while he shook hands
with price kilmer the other man-
short stout red-faced and inclined to
puff short-windedly having found it
absolutely necessary to change my mode
of living on account of cramped fi-
nances i gave up my rooms in van-
derbilt and am living somewhat more
modestly in a thoroughly respectable if
not thoroughly swell dormitory

  why old man said bernfield
promptly if you are a bit hard up for
any reason there are plenty of fellows
who would loan you all you need- you
should know you could come to me any
time i believe ive found it necessary
to give you the touch once or twice
im afrrid you dont understand the
circumstances bern i appreciate what
you have iust said but i wasnt in a
position to go on living here as i had
lived and i couldnt borrow money of
anybody without knowing how i was
to pay it

  is it possible said kilmer in a
throaty voice that theres some truth
in the rumor i heard about you bolt-
wood  did your dad fall out with
you 

  no smiled roger i was the one
who fell out and i struck bottom hard
look here said kilmer it aint
true is it that youre the r boltwood
who drove the winning keating kar in
the traymore cup race  somebody
said so but i didnt believe it


top-notch magazine

  im the same r boltwood ad-
mitted roger

  well by jove by jove gurgled
the stout chap wouldnt believe it
said i knew better why you won the
cup  driving a keating too  howd
it happen you didnt drive a comet
its a long sad story laughed
roger with pretended lightness i
will not weary you with the tale i will
say however that by driving a keat-
ing and defeating the comet i appar-
ently drove the final and clmching nail
in the coffin containing my hope of
reconciliation with one henry bolt-
wood now i beg you spare my feel-
ings

  oh its all a joke-i know it is
declared conklin these fathers get
grouchy sometimes but they have to
come round in the end come on
everybody lets saunter over to heubs
and have a bait if boltwood chooses
to play the part of a martyr until his
old man relents hes the only one that
will have to suffer mighty clever idea
bolt-really it is the old boy will get
worried about you and come nosing
around to find you living frugally like
a poverty-stricken dub and hell be
smitten by remorse because of his cold
and cruel brutality and hell fold you

to his penitent bosom and-

 youve never met my father
conk interrupted roger if he
should chance to find me living on husks
in a hovel there would be no slaughter
of the fatted calf i cant seem to con-
vince you that ive cut out the frisky
thirst quencher but again i declare it

as a positive fact i have-- whats

the matter storrow

  martin storrow was surveying with
an expression of intense dislike a quar-
tet of young men who were sauntering
past

  oh nothing only theres pony
dill growled storrow he thinks
hes the real thing since he got in with
keatings crowd the lisping little
jackass he attempted to throw the
hooks into me once and im waiting for
a chance to get back at him

  tom keating himself was one of the
four swagger-looking youths who were

chatting and laughing as they sauntered
by roger and his companions nod-
ding in a friendly yet reserved man-
ner keating spoke to each of the fel-
lows save roger calling them by name
his omission of boltwood was so obvi-
ous that as a specimen of bad man-
ners it reached the limit

  the infernal cad murmured nor-
ry bernfield evidently he still re-
members the time you made him look
like a cheap shine with the eight-ounce
gloves bolt i never did have much
use for that bounder

  but rog drove the keating kar in
the cup race gurgled kilmer

and was paid for it put in roger
back from the students who had
passed drifted the voice of tom keat-
ing oh theyll drop him when they
find out he hasnt the coin to keep up

the pace they- his words became

indistinguishable conklin bernfield
kilmer and storrow looked at one an-
other and then at roger they knew
he had heard the words intended for his
ears but instead of seeming at all dis-
turbed he smiled

  the dirty cad exploded conklin
well show him come on rog you
cant refuse now

  he passed his arm through bolt-
woods nodding to kilmer who
promptly took the other arm and in this
manner they bore roger away to heub-
leins

chapter xxi

the toast

doger insisted on taking sarsapa-
 rilla not even the remonstrances
of kilmer or the joshing of conklin in-
fluenced him to change his mind when
bernfield produced his monogrammed
case and passed it boltwood declined to
take a cigarette

  ive cut out smoking too he stated
gravely you know an automobile
racing driver needs his nerve and ciga-
rettes arent the best thing in the world
for a mans nerves

  do you mean to say youve gone
into the racing game as a business 
asked kilmer dubiously bowing to some
boltwood of yale



students passing their table its dan-
gerous old man you must have seen
proof of that in that cup race if youre
really looking to be killed however
you might take up flying thats got
the other thing beaten when it comes to
the number of subjects it furnishes for
the undertaker

  if it hadnt been for the racing game
i wouldnt be here now said roger
quietly and ive made a sort of agree-
ment with cyrus keating if i drive in
another race it will be at the wheel of
a keating kar

  storrow shook his head his habit-
ual solemn manner had led his friends
to give him the nickname of gloom
couldnt hire me to drive in one of
those races he asserted for fifty
thousand dollars

  still said roger youll sit in the
tonneau of a high-powered car with a
lot of drinks under your belt and no-
body can drive fast enough to keep you
from growling about the way hes
crawling along

  thats different

  yes its different and the difference
lies in the fact chat in a professional
race the driver probably is absolutely
sober while m a joy ride nine times out
of ten he isnt ive been doing some
thinking in the last ten minutes  fel-
lows i appreciate the manner in which
you brought me here and your evident
purpose to demonstrate that altered cir-
cumstances on my part have not
changed your regard for me in spite
of all that the situation is decidedly
altered last year i was in a position
to accept hospitality and favors from
any man for i could return everything
with interest to-day its different

  oh come- bernfield attempted

to break in

  wait bern persisted roger let
me say what i started to say you
ought to know fellows that im not the
kind of a chap to travel with any set
of fellows unless able to keep up my
end im no sponge or hanger-on
id punch the man who hinted such
a thing exclaimed bernfield

  thanks  youre a gentleman bern
now you can all see the position in

which you would place me if i tried to
keep in with you i couldnt do my
share of the buying for i havent got
the needful what little money ive
got i must take care of if im going to
get through the present college year
youve offered to loan me money but
i hope i can get through yale without
being compelled to borrow a dollar
from any man

  noble ambition muttered kilmer
with a slight touch of sarcasm it
seemed

  there may be nothing noble about it
but ive just decided on that one thing
and im going to ask you fellows to
help me stick to it your friendship i
shall always appreciate be sure of that
no matter if i cant be one of you and
you can see that that is out of the ques-
tion ive got to follow the only course
open to me that will allow me to main-
tain my self-respect last year i was
known as a high roller but theres no
more high rolling for me-no more gay
parties midnight suppers joy rides and
all that the day my father and i dis-
solved i came down to earth with a
thump that jarred me and opened my
eyes to just what i was up against
but we cant let you quit our little
circle of good fellows rog protested
conklin we wont listen to it

  norry bernfield sipped his high ball
and put down the glass meditatively
suddenly he said boltwood is right
fellows ive been trying to put myself
in his place and i think i can see this
thing from his viewpoint in his posi-
tion id feel just as he does although i
might not be as cheerful it takes a lot
of sand for a man to be cheerful when
hard luck has handed him a solar-
plexus wallop of this sort bolt i want
you to remember that im your friend
under any and all circumstances i
hope you wont forget it

  i wont bern bet your life im
glad you appreciate my position im
glad you back me up as a special fa-
vor i want to ask you fellows to do
something for me whenever you feel
like inviting me to join you as you have
to-day i wish you wouldnt youll
simply make it lecessary for me to re-


top-notch magazine

fuse and you can imagine that refus-
ing wouldnt be the easiest thing in the
world

  are ou going to cut everything
out asked storrow are you going
to keep away from your club even
you havent shown your nose there
since coming back

  because i knew id run into friends
who would extend invitations to con-
viviality and i was ducking such things
when all my friends come to know just
how the matter stands youll see me
around the club sometimes he turned
the lapel of his coat and displayed his
fraternity pin

  everybody figured said kilmer
that you were one man of the bunch
who stood the best chance of making
bones

  bones  exclaimed roger modulat-
ing his voice involuntarily although
there seemed to be no listeners to fear
outside their little group i one of the
fifteen favored by the gods quit your
kidding gloomy

  still murmured bernfield moving
his glass round and round on a little
wet spot still it wouldnt surprise me
you may stand a better chance than
you would if things hadnt happened
this way

   roger lifted his glass of sarsaparilla
drink to my good luck he begged
theres really worse luck than for a
spendthrift son to be kicked outdoors
by a rich dad a year ago i wouldnt
have thought so ive changed my mind
about many things in the last few
weeks drink boys it may be the last
time youll have a chance to do so with
roger boltwood-unless you drink at
a soda fountain

   norry bernfield rose to his feet lift-
ing his glass im going to drink it
standing then he said as the others
imitated his example heres to roger
boltwood good fellow loyal friend
man to his marrow may he get a
strangle hold on hard luck and put it
to the mat i believe he will and if
anybody wants to gamble on it ill back
bolt to the extent of every dollar i can
raise

  thank you bernfield said roger

quietly suppressing a sudden throb of
feeling youve given me a good big
boost on the way

  drink it down drink it down cried
the others heres to boltwood
they clinked their glasses and drank
now fellows said roger i hope
youll excuse me for ive got to get
back to my rooms and do some grind-
ing yes im actually studying and if
i fail to pass a second time it wont be
my fault

  they shook hands with him and
watched him leave bernfields eyes
taking the measure of his fine figure as
he passed out of the room and the door
closed behind him for some rfiinutes
the four men sat silently around the
table

  jove came presently from kil-
mers lips hard luck for boltwood
eh 

  hard luck said bernfield instant-
ly nothing of the sort it might
have seemed like hard luck for a weak-
er fellow for him it was the best that
could have happened i didnt dream
he had the stuff in him but hes show-
ing that its there all right and hell
come out on top if this hadnt hap-
pened to him he might have developed
into a useless spender instead of a real
man

chapter xxii

the unmasking

roger boltwood had disap-
peared from his former haunts at
new haven and he was seen no more
with the swift set in which he had once
scintillated as a star of the first mag-
nitude therefore it was no more
than natural that many of those who
thought of him at all recalling the fact
that he had been dropped a year
reached the conclusion that he had not
returned to yale some of these told
themselves that it was no particular loss
to the college

  of course tom keating chuckled
with malicious satisfaction and called
the attention of his friends to the fact
that he had been quite right in prophe-
sying boltwoods prompt throw-down
boltwood of yale



by former chums when they should
learn of his altered circumstances

  roger had spoken the truth when he
declared that he was studying hard he
was doing so for the first time in his
life always until the occasion of the
humiliating failure which had set him
back a year in college he had in some
way succeeded in getting by one
reason for such good luck was that he
had an elastic mind which permitted
itself to be crammed and jammed to the
limit at the very last moment retaining
this condition of falsely acquired infor-
mation and knowledge just long enough
to make temporary use of it-then
seeming to forget it all completely

  that the modest student who roomed
in lawrence appeared regularly in
class chapel and lecture hall and spent
hours studying like any ordinary grind
was the former high-flying roger bolt-
wood seemed incredible-even to roger
himself

  again and again he found himself
lagging a little and yearning to falter
even in his rooms during those hours
he had resolved to spend in honest study
he often awoke to realize that he was
loafing and dreaming like any other
lazy irresponsible chap

  not that he had foolishly made up his
mind never to rest never to relax he
had sense enough to know that rest and
relaxation are absolutely essential to the
man who would rise to his highest effi-
ciency and make the most of himself
not however until he had satisfied
himself with each days required task
would he sit back and take things easy

  it was in one of these breathing
spells not long after the college term
got fairly into smooth-running order
that philbin made a suggestion roger
was walking restlessly up and down the
cramped room with martins eyes fol-
lowing him when the latter suddenly
said

  why dont you go out for the eleven
bolt  if i had your build and spring-
steel make-up i would youre like a
caged beast sometimes prancing back
and forth here to work off some of
your surplus energy

  roger stopped short and stared at his

roommate the eleven phil i
dont remember receiving a letter of
invitation to come out

  you dont have to have one you
know a general notice was posted in the
gym why should you receive a spe-
cial invitation anyhow

  dont know of any particular rea-
son admitted roger only its cus-
tomary to send out such special re-
quests to especially promising sub-
jects

  do you consider queried philbin
that youve been an especially promis-
ing subject

  hardly dont know why i should
go in for football if it were baseball
i might feel differently about it i do
get cramped and nervous sitting here
plugging and i suppose i ought to take
up something reckon the best thing
would be a general line of work in the
gym

  and where would that get you to
old man  it might put those good mus-
cles and sinews of yours in a little bet-
ter condition but youd be the only man
to benefit by it

  well im the only man ive got to
look out for at present am i not
you are-not simply because
youve been selfish and egotistical-
never thought of any one except roger
boltwood-now dont hand me that
sort of a glare youve said it yourself-
simply because youve been that way all
your life up to date doesnt make it
right for you to continue that way
youve turned over a new leaf its
time now that you dug yourself well out
of the old ruts

  well say philbin youre certainly
handing me a warm line of conversa-
tion egotism selfishness  will you
please demonstrate where my egotism
stands out so prominently will you
explain what you mean by calling me
selfish 

  ill do my best said philbin cheer-
fully im not denying that your
course since being cast forth upon the
world by your father has been rather
commendable-as far as it goes be-
fore that you were selfish without any
particular effort on your part since


top-notch magazine

then youve been compelled to make
efforts but youve made them for your-
self alone with absolutely no thought
for any one else

  huh i grunted roger frowning
go on  go on 

  and youre egotistical youre
proud of the fact that you didnt be-
come a bummer and gutter vag after
your father threw you out

  proud of it why shouldnt i be

  philbin smiled that charming friend-
ly smile wrhich displayed his fine teeth
did avoiding that prove to be such a
terribly difficult thing he asked do
you think you deserve any tremendous
amount of credit for your success thus
far were you compelled to work like
a dog and suffer every sort of privation
in order to get back here to college
isnt it a fact that you tumbled into a
streak of luck and won your way back
at a single stroke by doing something
you were especially qualified to do by
nature and some degree of experience
by performing a piece of work that re-
quired only hours instead of days and
months and years-a piece of work at
that which gave you keen delight in-
stead of acute suffering

  boltwood raised a hand in smiling
protest

  wait just a moment i havent fin-
ished said philbin isnt it a fact
that having made a tremendous stride
toward the goal in that easy manner
you are still finding a sort of chesty
pride in giving up your former luxuri-
ous easy mode of living cutting your-
self off from old friends and demon-
strating that youve got a lot of bull-
dog determination in you that makes
you just as good as the next fellow-
and a little better than the most of
them  dont you every time you think
of the old enjoyable fleshpots pat your-
self metaphorically on the baclf and
whisper compliments for your own
ears

  gradually boltwoods face had taken
on a deeper flush and now it was burn-
ing scarlet he had seemed indignant
at the outset but now he appeared to
be considering the plain words of his
roommate not one of which had wholly

missed the target philbin gave him
time

  suddenly roger looked up laughing
in a half-shamed manner by jove
philbin he said youve certainly got
it all figured out to a t i never
thought of it that way before but
youre right youre dead right he
sank down on a chair elbows on his
knees his chin propped on his cupped
hands

  i thought youd see it said philbin
his manner wholly devoid of the offen-
sive you know the old saying a
knock is a boost and i mean it that
way in this case if i hadnt felt abso-
lutely positive that you had the right
stuff in you boltwood id never have
said the things i have

  thanks said roger slowly i
didnt realize that i was wearing a mask
till you stripped it off phil now im
just beginning to get a look at my real
self say what have i done to feel
chesty about what am i doing now
thats not as you put it solely for my
own selfish ends  i thought i had
proved myself some real big gun but i
see that as yet ive proved nothing at
all- it was luck that boosted me from
the time i found cyrus keating stalled
on long island until i won the tray-
more cup and a man who has been
raised by mere luck and goes round
hugging the idea that hes the greatest
thing that ever happened is simply an
egotistical foolish dub ive collapsed
like a pricked bladder phil youve
taken the wind out of my sails com-
pletely

  i dont want to do that i want to
put more wind into them i want you
to stand by the helm and steer a
straight course for the right port say
im getting nautical and i never saw
the ocean in my life until i came to
college

  his pleasant laugh brought a smile
creeping back to boltwoods face but
roger immediately grew grave again
a frown crept into his brow and the
muscles of his jaw tensed perceptibly

  in this matter of selfishness he said
presently i dont see just what im
going to do were all selfish every
boltwood of yale



one of us were working for our-
selves we plug to get an education
order that we may be fitted to go into
the world and buck up against things
and win-for our own good youre
doing that very thing i realize that it
has cost you a blamed sight more than

it has me but-

  thats generous at least bolt do
you know what id do if i could do
you know whats caused me no small
amount of regret because of my inabil-
ity to get at it ill tell you if i had
any small qualifications which would
enable me to go in for football base-
ball rowing or the track team youd
see me spending all the time needed to
develop those qualifications id do it
not simply for myself but for my col-
lege i think ive felt a bit of the true
yale spirit already although like most
fellows in my position ive had little
chance to get saturated with it its a
great thing boltwood-the yale spirit
do you know what it is

  why really old man im not sure
i thought i did i thought it meant
loyalty to old eli i thought it meant
belief in yale its traditions its glories
its magnificent accomplishments i
thought it meant a feeling of fellowship
toward every worthy loyal yale man
and you might add that you thought
it meant following up the track events
and cheering for the yale men who par-
ticipated you thought it meant sitting
on the bleachers at a football or baseball
game and singing and cheering with
the rest of your class you thought it
meant going down to new london and
yelling yourself hoarse for the crew it
means more than all that it means
action it means hard work long and
persistent work and sharp strenuous
endeavor to maintain the standard of
the college in some way or other when
a man isnt fitted to do this on the ath-
letic field or in the boat he has to look
around for other methods certainly
hes far less fortunate than the fellow
who can train for and take part in ath-
letics youre a natural athlete bolt-
wood if you hadnt been your man-
ner of living would have put you to the
bad long ago no matter what form of

athletics you take up you should go in
for something or other without falter-
ing or delay its a duty you owe your
college i suggested football because
it seemed to me that you were built for
it and i know the team is going to need
every good man it can develop this
year

  boltwood again resumed his walk up
and down the length of the turkish
rug for a minute or two philbin
watched him quizzically one eyebrow
elevated in that odd manner of his but
he did not venture to say anything fur-
ther presently roger paused and
turned toward his companion

  im going to think this thing over
phil he announced decisively im
much obliged for your suggestion per-
haps ill make a try

chapter xxiii

out for the eleven

the following day roger boltwood
appeared before captain brinkley
brooks on the football field and an-
nounced himself as a candidate for the
team although knowing boltwood by
reputation brooks did not recognize
him and he surveyed the applicant
with a critical eye

  youve got the build he said
ever play 

  at andover one year

  only one

   thats all

  what was the matter why didnt
you play longer was it your last
year 

my second answered roger real-
izing that he was beginning to turn red
i sort of-fell out of it-after that
hum grunted brooks wthats
your name

  boltwood

  eh boltwood notroger bolt-
wood  why hang it yes you are i
remember some one pointing you out to
me once boltwood

  roger wondered under what circum-
stances this had happened and think-
ing of the escapades by which he had
won the title of high roller the crim-
son deepened in his face


top-notch magazine

  brooks was looking him over once
more out on the field a great swarm
of men were working under the direc-
tions of red harney the head coach
and several assistants roger pretended
to be interested in their maneuvers
while brooks took his physical measure
for the second time

  i presume youre serious about this
boltwood said the captain of
course you know what it means you
know youll have to cut out the fancy
stuff come down to plain living steady
training and rigorous hard work un-

lessvyou mean to-

  if i hadnt meant to comply with
every requirement i wouldnt be here
captain brooks interrupted roger a
bit warmly

 hi addison hailed brooks
come here pase

  at the call a young man in soiled
football togs turned and jogged up

  addison this is roger boltwood a
new candidate take him over to the
locker building and find him some sort
of a suit will you

  sure responded addison with a
ghost of a grin as he looked roger
over aint much stuff left but i reck-
on i can fit him out somehow come
on boltwood

  in the locker building addison final-
ly dug out an old jersey some pants
a pair of heelless toeless stockings and
some disreputable cleated shoes

  this stuff has been through the
wash boltwood he said but i dont
know as youll care to put it on per-
haps youll feel more like furnishing
your own togs

  on the contrary answered roger
as he began to peel dowrn i dont feel
that way at all football clothes cost
money

  i guess you can afford em if you
want to if a fellow in your place
hasnt confidence enough in himself to
spend that much im doubtful of his
chance to last very long

  roger did not see fit to enlighten ad-
dison concerning the conditions which
evidently made him appear in the mans
eyes like a miser boltwood was tired

of such explaining and in time addi-
son would find out for himself

  left alone roger made haste to get
into the worn garments and returned
with as little delay as possible to the
field where perceiving brooks hard at
work with a bunch of greenhorns he
reported to red harney

  all right snapped harney with-
out even looking at him go out
there and chase punts with those fel-
low

  although the rules were greatly
changed since the year when he had
played half-heartedly at andover rog-
er knew how to chase punts and fall
on the ball scientifically even if he was
somewhat out of practice neverthe-
less a period of slamming himself onto
the pigskin seemed to attract the atten-
tion of no one save andy dowling a
man with whom he collided in a mix-up
of two erratically bounding balls

  now it chanced that once on a time
boltwood had unintentionally though
perhaps not without some blame in-
curred the displeasure of dowling who
had fancied that roger maliciously sin-
gled him out for ridicule by imitating
his misfortune as a stutterer which was
rather pronounced in times of excite-
ment not having a forgiving disposi-
tion or being of a forgetful turn
dowling had maintained a pronounced
dislike for roger from that day

  and now by accident they came to-
gether with a crash as they flung them-
selves bodily at one of the two bounding
footballs the shock made both of
them see stars for a moment and their
attitudes of half-stunned astonishment
as they lifted themselves from the
ground would have caused laughter had
not every one around them been too
busy with his own affairs to give them
attention

  urn-mum  groaned roger rubbing
his head and blinking at dowling i
beg your pardon

  huh rasped dowling glaring
back why didnt you fall on your
own bub-ball  what are you dud-do-
ing here anyhow 

  im trying to do the same thing you
boltwood of yale



are i reckon returned roger cheer-
fully choosing to ignore the wrathful
sneering manner of the other man
im tearing up the earth in a mad en-
deavor to prove that ive special quali-
fications to become yales football star
of the present season

  you muttered dowling as if he
could not believe it possible why

  yes thats quite true admitted
roger rising quickly and offering the
other man a helping hand but youre
thinking about last year its different
now

  ignoring the proffered assistance
dowling scrambled up

  fuf-fuf-fine football pup-plaver
- he began

  but roger cut him short in the midst
of his stammered sarcasm thanks
for the compliment dowling theres
a coach snarling his head off at us
wed better cut out the sociable chat
just now

  he caught up one of the footballs
gave it a deft turn between his two
palms dropped it and punted it easily
and gracefully straight into the hands
of the fuming coach the latter gave
roger a single sharp look as if mean-
ing to recognize him again and the
practice went on next time roger
saw andy dowling the man with some
other candidates chosen from the green
squad was waiting his turn to tackle
the dummy boltwood wondered how
it happened that he was not given a
chance at the canvas man but decided
that it was because he had appeared
late on the field as a candidate dowling
having had the advantage of more than
a week of practice

  there wras a short game between the
scrub and the regulars watched wtith
deep interest and anxiety by the big
group of new men who were ambitious
to become players a few of these
were called into action at intervals by
the coach who plainly had special ones
in his mind that he wished to give
work of this sort feeling a throb of
satisfaction because dowling was not
among the ones thus favored roger
was genuinely ashamed when he real-
ga

ized that such jealous emotion wqs evi-
dence of the selfishness with which he
had been charged by philbin

  thus early a considerable list of
hopeless would-bes had been dropped
and to-day still more of the aspiring
but never-could-qualify candidates
were given notice that they must shelve
their hopes of football glory every-
thing in the form of deadwood was be-
ing trimmed away as fast as possible
to give the coaches a chance to concen-
trate their work upon a smaller num-
ber who seemed really worthy of at-
tention henceforth as the reduced
ranks of the volunteers were tested
more and more minutely men would
continue to be dropped in gradually de-
creasing numbers until the season ad-
vancing a regular squad of possible
players would remain to be drilled
pounded hammered and tried in every
conceivable way by which the right
men might be culled from it for the last
great game of the year

  perhaps its a good thing i didnt
come out earlier thought boltwood
maybe id have found myself dropped
already without having a fair chance

  arriving at his rooms after the usual
short run shower and rubdown which
followed practice roger told philbin
what he had done and was congratu-
lated

  oh but youll get there youll make
the team predicted philbin confident-
ly if you dont make it this year
theres another year coming you
know

  ive thought of that but being of an
impetuous and impatient natu ive
decided to make it this year its be-
come something of a necessity after
your talk of yesterday in which you
brutally opened my eyes to the fact that
thus far ive really done nothing at all
worthy of feeling cocky over in order
to win back a certain necessary amount
of self-respect ive got to do something
worth while you gave me a tip and
im following it watch my smoke

  but if roger really entertained a be-
lief that his rapid progress would heat
the air to the smoking point he was
doomed to disappointment coming

out for the second and third days he
found himself still one of the unrecog-
nized mass of greenhorns who were al-
lowed to pound themselves stiff and
sore chasing the ball and falling on it
but for some unknown reason he was
not called on to try the dummy or to
take part in a real scrimmage

  what made it all the more annoying
was the fact that dowling had appar-
ently attracted red harneys attention
and was given an opportunity to work
with the scrub in a practice game dur-
ing which although he did nothing spe-
cially remarkable he had a position in
the line-and filled it

  the opening game with wesleyan
was at hand more men were dropped
but still though seemingly ignored
boltwood did not receive notice that his
services were no longer required at the
field within him however there
sprouted and grew a sense of being
baffled of increasing annoyance which
threatened to develop into resentment

  theres something back of this he
decided just as thousands of men be-
fore him had arrived at the conviction
that partiality was keeping them from
advancement toward a definite goal i

dont know what it is but im sure
something is preventing me from get-
ting a chance to show theyve got to
give me a chance if they dont some-
body is going to hear a loud unpleasant
noise at least

  when he told his roommate philbin
betrayed apprehension but youre not
going to quit he cried

  roger snorted quit say phil
what do you take me for ive just be-
gun they cant throw me down with-
out giving me some sort of a try-out
and if i get as much as half a show im
going to make some of those other men
go like blazes to hold their jobs

  you will said philbin his eyes on
rogers lower jaw if you get half
a show youll play against harvard this
year if i ever gambled-which i do
not-id bet on it

the cardiff giant

one of the most famous hoaxes ever perpetrated in this country was undoubt-
edly the so-called cardiff giant

    on october   tremendous excitement was caused by a report that
the petrified body of a prehistoric giant had been discovered at cardiff new
york by some men who were digging a well

    crowds flocked to see the wonder newell the finder made seven thousand
dollars in a week barnum offered sixty thousand dollars down for it but his
offer was rejected

    the finder took the giant from town to town in one day four thousand
people paid fifty cents apiece to see it

    eventually it was discovered that the amazing prehistoric relic had been
carved at boone in iowa by an italian stone cutter and that from this town it
had been secretly sent to newells farm and buried at dead of night as the
huge stone image weighed almost three thousand pounds the cleverness of the
perpetrators of the fake was really extraordinary

good material

a party of ladies on it being reported that a certain captain silk had arrived
 in town exclaimed with one exception what a name for a soldier

    the fittest name in the world rejoined a witty female for silk can never
be worsted
immy hardy was fright-
ened twice since the circus
season opened he had fallen
from his trapeze and circus
tradition has it that the third
fall means deathor serious injury he
was superstitious as every circus per-
former is and the fact that he realized
that he was afraid made his apprehen-
sion more poignant each time he had
fallen he had worn a suit of yellow
tights

  jimmy was regarded as one of the
best trapeze performers in the country
he was a feature with the macmahon
shows a ten-car aggregation which
played the eastern coast from bangor
to jacksonville as he was an all-
around performer he was called upon
for the free act outside the kid or
side show before the opening of the
main tent-a wire act a single-trapeze
act and a double-trapeze act with a per-
former named salee-and he helped in
the big flying act which closed the
show

  each year jimmy declared that the
macmahon shows were becoming too
much of a workshop for him and that
he would quit at the end of the season
but whenever he heard that florida
kelly had signed for another year he

hurriedly sent for a contract and an-
nexed his name to the line at the bottom
of it forty dollars a wteek was a good
salary he thought if florida queen
of the air was with the show if she
had not been a hundred dollars a week
would not have looked especially good
to him

 miss kelly was not remarkably
pretty she was just an ordinary mat-
ter-of-fact sensible little circus woman
who had been in the business since early
childhood and liked it her mother
was still a flyer in the big act and
florida did wire flying-ring and tra-
peze acts that were very clever

  she had been on the show with jim-
my so long that she regarded him as
her especial charge and bossed him ac-
cordingly much to jimmys delight

  the show had been out five weeks
when one day jimmy came for the
second time from his berth in the
sleeper where he had been confined by
his injuries during the seven long
days when he had stared for hours at
the dreary scenery along the route or
strained his ears for the sound of the
band from the circus lot he had regis-
tered a solemn vow never again to wear
a spit of yellow tights

  he told this to florida as he came


top-notch magazine

upon her where she was washing her
tights in a tub of soapywater behind
the cook house she listened as she
always did to jimmy the while busily
scrubbing wringing and hanging the
various garments on a guy line to dry

  if you feel that way about yellow
she said when he finished youd be
foolish to wear it youd fall sure
ive got three yellow pairs in my
trunk jimmy went on besides six
other pairs anybody who wants the
yellow ones can have them

  florida wrung out her last garment
and hung it on the line run in and
get your soiled tights she offered
and ill wash them out for you
jimmy ducked under the side wall of
the dressing tent as she changed the
water in her tub he returned in a
few minutes with an odd look in his
face over his arm he carried three
pairs of tights-blue red and pink

  heres a funny thing he said puz-
zled i had a pair of lavender tights
and theyve disappeared in their place
i found a pair of yellow ones now
ive got four pairs of yellow ones
florida looked up at him suddenly
with concern in her face jimmy
youre getting nervous youd better
take things easy for a day or so you
aint well yet

  oh im all right unless im going
color blind

  she took the tights from his hand
and plunged them into the warm water
as jimmy seated himself on a blue
property box and began to roll a ciga-
rette from the makings

  maybe somebodys putting a jinx
on me he said after he had smoked a
while in silence

  florida let it go at that

  jimmy was proud of his wardrobe
as circus people call their ring costumes
and usually changed his tights for each
of his acts when he went back to
work florida noticed that he stuck to
one color during the entire show when
she saw this she knew that jimmy was
more worried than he cared to admit

  one night after the show as she en-
tered the privilege car with jose
salee jimmys partner on the double

traps she saw jimmy seated at a
table in a corner with his back turned
to the table at which she and salee sat
down

  jose salee was a black-haired black-
eyed young costa rican who had been
in the states and the show business
since his early boyhood his forehead
was narrow and his black eyebrows
met in the middle and gave him a-sin-
ister appearance although he and
jimmy worked together they had never
become friends salee was too fond of
florida for jimmys comfort

  a noisy crowd of performers and
ticket sellers came trooping into the
privilege car from the lot and lined up
at the bar the cash register began to
ring steadily and the talk became gen-
eral and loud

  salee leaned over the table toward
florida there was a challenge in the
black depths of his eyes jimmys no
man for you he said hes begin-
ning to go back two falls in five
weeks is bad the next time he falls
hell be down and out

  hes cut out the yellow tights for
good she replied i ordered six new
pairs of different colors for him to-
day

salee looked surprised is that so
he said slowly whenll he get them
they ought to be at belmont when
the show reaches there next week
florida answered

  salee was silent finally lowering
his voice he asked are you and jim-
my going to get married

  floridas face flushed jimmy hadnt
asked that question himself but she saw
no reason for letting salee know that
instead her head flew back and she
answered quickly 

  thats our business

  listen flo said salee eagerly i
love you will you marry me

  she turned her head slightly and saw
that jimmys back was still toward
them no she replied i dont love
you

  his face grew red with anger his
voice was filled with passion pll make
you love me he cried if it wasnt
the yellow dread



for jimmy i believe you would love me
now

  his voice had risen and several peo-
ple at near-by tables turned toward
them floridas blue eyes flashed

  youve no right to talk like that
she said ive given you no cause to
i dont love you and youll please leave
my private affairs alone if youre go-
ing to sit here you must talk lower do
you think i want these women gabbing
about me

  salee pushed back the little bench he
was sitting on and rose ill make you
love me yet he whispered passionate-
ly then turned on his heel and walked
out of the car

  florida started to call jimmy but re-
sisted the inclination as she rose to
go back to the sleeper a big blond
woman who did a strong act in the
side show called her

  you want to watch out for that
black-haired fellow she said warning-
ly i heard what he said those
greasers cant be trusted i had one of
them for a husband once if you need
any help let me know

  thanks said florida reddening
but i guess i can handle him without
any outside help thanks just the
same

  she went back to her berth where
she laid awake half the night planning
to help jimmy in his fight against the
jinx and wondering just how much
salee had to do with it

ii

the next day as soon as the show
got back to the lot after the pa-
rade jimmy sought florida there
was a worried frown between his eyes
and his face was paler than usual

  how many pairs of tights did you
wash for me the other day he asked

  three answered florida one
blue one red and one pink you said
you left two white pairsstid four yel-
low pairs in your trunk

  well the red pair is missing said
jimmy and i found five yellow ones
in my trunk

  jimmy said florida with finality
you are going color blind

  for answer jimmy went to the dress-
ing tent and returned a few minutes
later with five pairs of yellow tights on
his arm in astonishment florida sat
down on a stake puller and whistled
long and dolefully

  during the performance that after-
noon she watched jimmy carefully
she could see that the mysterious disap-
pearance of his tights and the equally
mysterious appearance of the yellow
ones in their place were affecting his
work at supper when they sat side
by side at the long table she suggested
that she dye his yellow tights he
would have enough then she told him
to last until his new ones arrived

  whiats the difference- he de-
murred theyd still be yellow under-
neath wouldnt they when i got on
the traps id think about the yellow
tights i had on last night when i was
doing that head balance i caught sight
of the yellow tights madge was wear-
ing and i came near tumbling off the
bar theres nothing to it flo that yel-
low colors got my goat

  two days later jimmy came to flor-
ida with downright terror written in his
face

  theres only one pair left he said
holding out the blue tights for her to
see every pair has been changed for
yellow ones but this i keep my trunk
locked i dont see how its being done
or whos doing it or wrhy theyre doing
it i cant understand it

  itll be two more days before we
get to belmont florida replied cant
you borrow a pair 

  no chance said jimmy even if
id wear another mans tights but i
draw the line there its bad luck id
rather drop out of the show

  when the night show was ready to
open jimmy coming across the lot
from the train met jose salee standing
in the dark near the entrance to the
dressing tent

  have you seen flo salee asked
shes looking for you

  jimmy glanced at his watch it lacked

but a few minutes of the time for the
opening pageant but he took the risk

  where is she

  down that way salee answered
pointing toward the cook tent

 jimmy dashed away and salee
turned and disappeared into the dress-
ing tent

  ten minutes later florida dressed
for the pageant saw him talking to a
negro ringman in the entryway salee
was too excited to notice her as she
came up and without trying she could
overhear all that he said to the negro
he seemed to be arguing

  youll be safe enough salee was
saying and itll mean twenty-five
bucks to you

  twenty-five bones is a heap ob
money but deys a heap ob risk too
said the timorous ringman

  there aint any risk salee de-
clared flatly hell be so excited he
wont notice anything and when i give
you the sign all you will have to do is to
step over to the rope and do it then
in the excitement you can slip away

  gimme the twenty-five said the
ringman after a moments hesitation

  itll be waiting for you after the
show is over said salee is it a go

  well i don like it much but i
reckon hits a go all right i sho needs
dat twenty-five

  the whistle blew for the leaps after
the pageant and the performers trooped
into the hippodrome track simultane-
ously there came excited words from
the mens dressing tent and jimmy ap-
peared at the door wrapped in a bath
robe his bare feet thrust into a pair
of wooden ring sandals his hair was
disheveled and his face white from
mingled anger and fright macmahon
rushed up to him as florida ran back
from the entry way to see what was the
matter

  what do you mean by not going in
the leaps macmahon demanded as he
grasped jimmy by the shoulder and
spun him around macmahon was a
big man and usually had his way un-
questioned but this time jimmy faced
him squarely

  my last pair of tights is gone i

found these in their place nine pairs
of yellow tights he thrust the arm-
ful toward the manager who let them
fall unnoticed to the ground

  what do i care about their color
he roared put em on and be quick
about it

ive fallen twice in yellow tights
said jimmy i wont wear them again
youll wear em to-night or youll
stay in this town the manager shouted

  theyre a hoodoo jimmy pleaded
if i wear em again ill fall and thatll
be the end of me

  the manager was red with anger he
strode forward his fist upraised
youll do as i say on this show he
roared whos paying your salary
floridas lithe figure in a red kimono
was between them in a flash she
turned to jimmy with a look of appeal
in her eyes

  go on jimmy and wear them to-
night she begged to-morrow ill
see that you get some other kind
jimmy was deathly pale he turned
a scornful accusing face upon her
so thats what you sent salee to tell
me you wanted to see me for is it
she looked up in astonishment and
her face flushed at the note in his voice
i didnt send salee to you what do
you mean

  but jimmy had gone to the dressing
tent he appeared a few minutes later
clad in yellow tights and passed florida
without speaking to her the girl
watched him puzzled trying to think
what he could have meant

iii

floridas eyes hardly left jimmy
 for a second that night as he went
through his various acts she was fear-
ful lest he might make a misstep on his
wire or that he would become fright-
ened while poised high in the air on his
trapeze

  but jimmy was recklessness itself
something seemed to be urging him to
feats of daring which he never at-
tempted unless he felt thoroughly fit
florida felt her heart contract as she
watched him
the yellow dread



  she was worried too about salee
she wondered if he had been plotting
with the ringman against jimmy the
costa rican had treated her strangely
since their talk in the privilege car and
she felt instinctively that he was await-
ing an opportunity to revenge himself
upon jimmy

  the show progressed smoothly until
the final act florida in her brilliant
red tights poised like a butterfly on her
flying trapeze stopped between each of
her cricks to took down upon jimmy as
he stood under her waiting for the sig-
nal to mount to the take-off on the fly-
ing-act rigging

  the ringmen were spreading the huge
net and guying it at the ends she
could see jimmys scornful look as he
walked from line to line testing them

  then something seemed to force her
glance upon salee he had just stepped
down from his wire and was saying
something to the negro she thought
she saw something bright in the ring-
mans hand

  her act was about over for the fin-
ish she had a long rope twisted so that
when she flung herself from her trapeze
bar it unwound and flung her far over
the audience it was a showy trick and
a dangerous one fastened only by one
foot if the rope should break or the
loop become untied she would be
hurled against a quarter pole or into
the seats perhaps to her death

  but she was not thinking of herself
her attention was riveted upon the men
beneath her mechanically she fas-
tened the loop about her foot as hand
over hand jimmy began to climb to the
cradle in the rigging in a moment
he stood upright upon it waiting for
his partners to climb to the other side

  she looked down again the negro
was moving rapidly to the thick rope
which supported the cradle on which
jimmy was standing a knife in his
hand for an instant caught the light
she knew now what he intended to do

  salee was standing directly under the
cradle waiting to give the man the sig-
nal to cut the line one slash and the
heavy rigging would give way and
jimmy outside the big safety net

would go hurtling to the ground no
other performers were near the big
rope and the negro doubtless felt safe
from observation

  florida hung by her knees and be-
gan to swing her trapeze furiously far
into the air every breath was a prayer
that she might be in time

  she reached the limit of her swing
and turned loose directly toward jim-
my

  like a red meteor she flew out in the
air the rope paying itself out behind
her

  she passed the cradle like a flash of
red light

  jump she shouted in a voice filled
with agony jump 

  her upturned gaze caught a momen-
tary flash of a yellow figure rolled like
a ball as it bounded up from the net
then she was caught by the rope and
jerked back the heavy flying rigging
came rushing down missing her head
by an inch she heard it as it fell
swishing by her then as she swung
back she saw the heavy iron bar catch
jose salee on the head and he went
down in a crumpled heap

iv

hile the ringmaster was quieting
the audience several performers
lifted salee from the ground and took
him into the pad room where they laid
him tenderly on a canvas couch a
hushed and awed group stood by wait-
ing for the doctors verdict

  the costa rican tried to raise him-
self he whispered something to the
physician who turned and nodded to
florida and jimmy making way for
them to draw close to the injured man

  be quick he said he wont last
long

  jimmy bent over the couch

  i guess im done for said salee in
a sibilant whisper i want to tell you
before i go-look in my trunk

  jimmy ran into the dressing tent and
returned a minute later with a bundle
of tights of different colors he laid
them on the ground beside salees
couch

  if thats whats bothering you old
man he whispered gently forget it
no id rather tell you jimmy said
the dying man ive been taking your
tights and giving you yellow ones i
knew it would get your goat after a
while and i wanted you to tumble i
wanted you to go down and out be-
cause i wanted flo

  he raised himself on his elbow and
his voice grew weaker well its all
over now i guess but the concert ill
feel better if you say you forgive me
its all right mumbled jimmy he
felt floridas slender hand slip into his
and he pressed it she knew then that
all was well between them-jimmy un-
derstood

  salee looked at her while his eyes
slowly glazed and he fell back on the
couch the physician stepped forward
and motioned back those who stood too
close after a while he turned and
shook his head

  its all over he said

  one or two of the women sobbed
convulsively florida kelly turned to
jimmy and buried her tear-wet face on
his shoulder in the silence she could
hear the voice of the big blonde who
did a strong act in the side show

  jose was a good kid all right she
was saying as she passed from one
performer to another ill head a sub-
scription to send his body home to
newark do you want to come in

                     parlor mountaineers
a party of twenty-seven intrepid mountain climbers whose paths had crossed
on the alps met again in new york recently and renewed memories of mont
blanc and the matterhorn by making an ascent of the service stairs of a popular
hotel from the first to the eighth floor they were the guests of countess natalie
kilfus whose home is on the riviera a short distance from monte carlo their
exploit marked the anniversary of a narrow escape of countess kilfus who lost
her footing and nearly went to her death with several of her party on an alpine
climbing trip several of her guests were members of that party

    the climbers gathered on the first floor of the hotel where they were roped
together in a chain for mutual support and each provided with an alpenstock
and the proper alpine headgear led by a guide in full mountain-climbing dress
they plodded upward flight by flight till they had gained the thin air of the
eight floor in safety

    on this floor the art room was decorated with firs pines and alpine scenery
a sugar cake in the image of mont blanc was the centerpiece of the table
tyrolese singers yodeled from a swiss hut in one corner of the room

prejudice on the bench

it was a case in an irish court and the prisoner seeming hard to satisfy jury-
 man after juryman was asked to leave the box however all things come to
an end even in ireland and at last the swearing of the jury was completed
and then the prisoner leaned over the dock and sought the ear of his counsel

judge ive been convicted under him siviral times already and maybe hes
beginnin to have a prejudice

no fatted calf

hirty-five thousand dol-
lars was a lot of money to fall
into all at once when hugh
cranson received lawyer
pattersons letter apprising
him of his good fortune he experienced
much the same sensation of surprise as
would one diving into a warm lake in
august and striking cold spring water
except that the shock was decidedly
pleasant

  hugh drummed thoughtfully on the
car window with his fingers perhaps
it would have been just as well if he
had remained in the old town after all
he had in reality taken up the same
job in the city that he had left in his
uncles store-grocery clerk in one of
the big department stores

  still he never could have endured
that old dark store the stuffy old-
fashioned counters piled half to the
ceiling with dusty goods the space be-
tween the counters set with ungainly
benches that nearly filled it and made it
impossible for two people to pass in the
aisle without turning sideways the
dingy kerosene lamps that served dimly
to illuminate the place in the evening
and the general haphazard jumbled-up
arrangement of everything

but he was going to change all that

now he would throw out those dusty
old counters that had done service for
nearly half a century and replace them
with double-deck plate-glass show cases
he would install electric lights and give
the whole interior a vigorous redecorat-
ing that would brighten it up

  of course mr potts would object to
all this that was to be expected but
hugh now owned a half interest in that
store and if he was to take an active
part in the management there were cer-
tainly going to be some improvements
made

  the train stopped at brookton and
hugh stepped off old jim carpenter
who had driven the hotel bus for
twenty years greeted him cordially and
invited him to ride on the drivers seat
as far as the hotel

  he left his bag at the hotel and
walked directly to the store he told
himself as he entered that it was like
reviewing an old picture even a dead
fly that hung dejectedly to the wire that
was suspended from the ceiling and
supported a smoky old kerosene lamp
looked strangely familiar hugh as-
sured himself that it was the same one
that had hung there when he left the
town five years before

  the store was free from customers
and he found mr potts going over the
contents of a large cash register the
young man gasped at the sight of this


top-notch magazine

fixture well well they had actually
acquired a cash register he could
hardly believe it

  he advanced on mr potts with a
friendly smile and outstretched hand
the old man glanced up from his mon-
ey counting bestowed on hugh a grim
perfunctory nod then jerked his head
toward the rear of the store

  busy he grunted shortly be
back there in a minute

  hugh was taken aback by the curt-
ness of the others greeting but walked
wondering to the rear of the store
where the old high desk the ponder-
ous antiquated safe and a few rickety
chairs gave it the semblance of an of-
fice

  he was still wondering at the others
coolness when the old man sauntered
back and inspected hugh from head to
foot for a minute before speaking

  regular dude aint you he ob-
served in a tone that startled the young
man into surprised resentment

  mr potts- he began

  i been expecting you any minute
the storekeeper interrupted laconically
knew you wouldnt lose no time get-
ting here to spend your poor dead un-
cles money even if the town wasnt
good enough for you during his life-
time

  why mr potts  cried hugh in a
hurt tone what do you mean

  be them all the clothes youve got
here questioned the storekeeper ig-
noring hughs question

 yes i-

  well youd better go down to dob-
bins and get something thats fit to
wrear i dont want no dudes hangin
round this store

  these clothes are as good as yours
retorted hugh angered at last by the
others manner

  there now dont go gettin sassy
round here admonished mr potts
sternly you go get some clothes like
i told you and then get back here and
get to work youve got to earn your
way if you hang round here

  earn my way gasped the aston-
ished hugh

  you bet you if you show youre

worth it i am goin to pay you five dol-
lars a week otherwise you dont get
nothin

  i wish you would tell me what you
are talking about exclaimed hugh by
now thoroughly exasperated by the
others attitude i own half this
store

  mebbe you dont retorted mr
potts mysteriously read the will
yet

  certainly not ive been in tow n
only about half an hour

  well youd better go up and see
lawyer patterson then hes executor
dryly suggested mr potts you wont
be so sassy when you see how things are
fixed

  i gather from that that there is a
string attached to this property said
hugh

  gather anything you like grunted
mr potts one thing yu may as well
understand first as last is that im boss
of this store and youre under my or-
ders you can obey em or get out and
stay out just as you like

  i am entirely at loss to understand
you returned hugh one thing is
certain however and that is if i have
anything to say about the management
of this store-and i see no reason why
i havent--i am going to make you
dance for the manner in which you
have treated me it is entirely un-
called for and i assure you i wont
overlook it

  youre welcome to all the dancing
you get out of me growled the store-
keeper as hugh stalked indignantly
out

  lawyer patterson greeted his visitor
heartily and invited him to a seat

  hugh then related to the lawyer the
conversation that had taken place be-
tween himself and mr potts

  well well so that is the attitude he
is taking eh said mr patterson
when he had concluded i was ex-
pecting something of the sort but i
hardly thought he would begin so
soon

  i wish you would tell me what it is
all about said hugh

  my friend said the old lawyer
on the rocks of success



kindly i am afraid you are up a
stump your uncle andrews will gives
potts absolute control of the store he
holds your share in trust to be turned
over to you when in his estimation you
are capable of taking charge of it in
the meantime you are to work under his
orders at whatever wages he considers
you are worth for a term of at least
five years after which if you have not
fulfilled the requirements of the will
your interest reverts to him

  what did uncle andrew do that
for exclaimed hugh in surprise

  i might have told you this in my
letter said the lawyer but i thought
it better to wait until i saw you now
i am going to talk frankly with you
and what i say must be kept in confi-
dence

  in the first place he continued
you incurred your uncles displeasure
when you left the store for the city sev-
eral years ago he had hoped that you
would grow into his place but i am in
a position to know that he was more
hurt than angered yet his old-fash-
ioned ideas of dignity were such that he
would not show that side of his feelings
to you now between you and me
potts had known for some time that
mr collins intended willing you a half
interest in the store potts wanted it
himself and tried to induce your uncle
to turn it over to him on the plea that
they had built up the business and had
been associated for nearly half a cen-
tury and it was no more than fair that
the survivor should own the store he
argued that you deserved nothing after
the way you had deserted them your
uncle was firm on that point however
and when potts found he could not in-
fluence him in that way he resorted to
other methods that were more success-
ful

  for instance  asked hugh interest-
edly

  well the report reached your uncle
that you were leading a dissolute riot-
ous life in the city-drinking and gam-
bling and having a gay time generally

  why there isnt a word of truth in
that cried hugh indignantly

  of course there isnt replied the

lawyer i know you too well for that
this information was given your uncle
to induce him to leave your interest in
the store so that potts would have abso-
lute control of course you under-
stand that potts is under bonds to the
probate judge to keep your share
valued at twenty thousand dollars in-
tact until the expiration of the five
years when it reverts to him if you
have not lived up to the requirements
and what he intends to do is to
make it so uncomfortable for me that i
will throw up my hands before the ex-
piration of that time exclaimed
hugh beginning to see the light

  exactly answered the lawyer i
realized what was coming at the time
your uncle made his will and had he
sought my counsel i would have done
what i could to avert this most deplor-
able state of affairs as it was mr
potts was present when the will was
made and i could say nothing

  ill make him dance for this or know
the reason why exclaimed hugh

  what are you going to do asked
the lawyer curiously

  cant you take this matter up with
the judge of probate he ought to be
able to straighten it out when he finds
how matters stand

  i could try answered mr patter-
son doubtfully

  all right you do it in the mean-
time ill go back to my job in the city
that is still open for me has potts
got a string on the rest of uncle an-
drews bequest

  no answered the lawyer  i have
the deed to your uncles old home
which is valued at five thousand dollars
also the ten thousand dollars life insur-
ance you can have these any time
ill take them now answered hugh
promptly

chapter ii

too much

a month after hughs return to the
city billy donaldson the grocery
drummer dropped into the old store
mr potts greeted him with surprise
thought youd quit the rockford gro-
cery company he said


top-notch magazine

  i have answered billy havent
been with them for three months i am
now representing the quality products
company of chicago and i dropped in
to see about your handling our goods
in your town

  i dunno said mr potts with sud-
den coolness  i aint taking on any new
brands theyre too hard to sell
ours wont be billy assured him
weve got a very alluring proposition
to make you see this is a brand-new
company and our goods are all new
and practically unknown to the public
but we have a system of introducing the
goods that will no doubt be a winner
what is your system inquired mr
potts curiously

  well we propose to give one of the
stores here the exclusive agency for all
our goods and then sample the town
and county with full-size packages of
every article we carry we will sam-
ple one article at a time by mailing the
customer a neat little letter inclosing a
coupon which will entitle him to a full-
size package of one of our commodities
when presented at the store one ad-
vantage of this is that it will bring to
your store many people who would not
come here ordinarily bring them not
once but man times which may result
in their becoming permanent patrons
we furnish the samples to you abso-
lutely free the only expense to you be-
ing the cost of cartage from the depot
and the time consumed in passing out
the samples you are not required to
lay in a stock of our goods until the
sampling is over and you are satisfied
as to the popularity of the quality
products

  that sounds pretty good said mr
potts reflectively you say you would
give me the exclusive agency if i took
it up 

  yes sir we will go under ten-
thousand-dollar bonds to fulfill our part
of the agreement and we expect you
to do the same

me go under bonds what for
merely to guarantee that you will
handle our goods conscientiously and
carry them for a period of at least two
years it being understood that this does

not interfere with your carrying any
other brands that you care to and that
we furnish you with our goods only
after we have created a demand for
them and then only in such quantities
as you may require the company fur-
ther agrees to take back all unsold
goods and refund the money if you are
dissatisfied at the expiration of the con-
tract

  say ill take up that proposition
exclaimed mr potts its the best i
ever had put up to me

  i knew youd do it when you saw
what we had to offer said billy
well go right out and have a lawyer
draw up the contract i have some
blanks with me

  ten days later a consignment of cof-
fee arrived for mr potts it was put
up in one-pound tin cans with attrac-
tive red labels and made a handsome
addition to the store shelves

  the next morning mrs jones mrs
addison and mrs shippy entered the
store simultaneously mrs shippy had
been a regular customer for thirty
years the other two women traded at
cromins on the corner

  mr potts who was presiding behind
the grocery counter noted this with
gratification mrs jones and mrs ad-
dison fluttered up and presented yellow
slips of paper and after mr potts had
adjusted his spectacles he found these
to be coupons issued by the quality
products company and that each en-
titled the bearer to one full-size can of
quality coffee absolutely free of
charge

  mr potts wrapped up the coffee and
watched the ladies depart with a broad
smile this trick was going to bring
him a lot of new customers he was
sure then he reached for mrs ship-
pys coupon

 mrs shippy had none she had
heard that a great many others received
letters through the post office the night
before containing coupons but none
had come for her

  now thats strange exclaimed
mr potts in a distressed tone im
sure i sent your address in oh it will
surely be along to-day or to-morrow
on the rocks of success



mrs shippy is there anything else i
can help you to 

  i came in for a pound of coffee an-
swered mrs shippy a bit coldly

  well now thats too bad said the
storekeeper id give you a sample if
i could but im under contract not to
give out any without the coupon

  then i guess ill wait until mine
comes decided mrs shippy but
she added with a suggestion of sarcasm
in her tone it seems to me youd see to
it that your own customers get theirs
first instead of folks who never trade
here

  mr potts watched her leave the store
with an expression of dismay he had
probably offended her well it was
the fault of the quality company he
must write them at once and tell them
to be more careful he had sent in the
addresses in two separate lists just as
billy donaldson instructed him to do
one of his own customers and one of
the outsiders there wras no excuse for
such a blunder

  mr potts did not write however-he
telegraphed following the exit of
mrs shippy the women began to flow
in and before noon he had exchanged
three hundred and ten cans of coffee
for coupons and in every instance as
he noted with growing alarm to out-
siders not one of his own customers
received a sample for the simple rea-
son that they had no coupons

  at noon he rushed to the telegraph
office and wired the company again

  two hours later he received this la-
conic and brief reply sent collect

  nothing in the contract binds us to send
coupons to any one except those we choose

  the boy who delivered the message
also brought notice that a shipment of
baking powder had just arrived by
freight for mr potts

chapter iii

unconditional surrender

dy noon next day mr potts had dis-
tributed all of the coffee and as no
inore coupons were presented it became
apparent to him that the company had
sent him exactly the number of cans re-

quired by the issue of coupons not
one of his regular customs had received
a coupon

  furthermore he wras now passing out
pound cans of quality baking powder
to presenters of coupons and while sev-
eral hundred people had been in and
carried away their cans not one among
them was a customer of the store his
own customers came in it is true but it
was to inquire indignantly why they
were excluded from this remarkable
free sampling

  mr potts tried to explain but
seemed to be unable to make any one
understand one or two left the store
satisfied with his assurance that they
would surely receive their coupons
later but the majority departed indig-
nant with the conviction that they were
being fiimflammed by the store which
they had stood by for years

  a remarkable change took place the
town turned over as it were for years
the firm of collins  potts had carried
fifty per cent of the trade of the com-
munity the rest was divided between
three smaller stores in the town

  a highly indignant fifty per cent sud-
denly ceased trading at collins  potts
and invaded the three smaller stores
almost swamping them the other fifty
per cent breezed cheerfully into the old
store received free samples of coffee
and baking powder and breezed out
again-and purchased the balance of
their necessities at their usual trading
places

  the day following the arrival of the
baking powder a consignment of soap
was received this was distributed six
cakes for each coupon the next day
brought yeast cakes and the next tea
and so on

  mr potts was frantic he wired the
company repeatedly and wrote them
long letters at night telling them his
woes and in every instance he received
curt and brief replies to the effect that
the company was living up to its part of
the contract and that mr potts was ex-
pected to do the same not once did
they offer any explanation for their ex-
traordinary conduct

  mr potts had a stormy interview


top-notch magazine

with lawyer patterson in the latters
office the contract was carefully gone
over and the lawyer assured the fran-
tic storekeeper that he was nailed up
tighter than a sheeps hide to the side
of a barn there was nothing that
withheld the company from sampling
the public with their products there
was no clause that compelled them to
send coupons to any except those they
chose they could continue distributing
samples for two years if they cared to
and mr potts was bound to deliver the
samples or forfeit his contract and the
ten-thousand-dollar bond

  mr potts returned to the store a sad-
dened man he locked his doors and
went home and sent for a doctor then
the rumor started that the storekeeper
was in bed and on the verge of a nerv-
ous breakdown it became evident that
the ordeal had become too much for
him

  two days later he received a letter
from the quality products company
calling hisattention to the fact that he
was not living up to his part of the con-
tract two consignments of goods one
of quality oatmeal the other of qual-
ity pancake flour were waiting on the
siding for distribution unless he at-
tended to these at once the company
would consider the contract broken and
would take immediate measures to col-
lect the ten thousand dollars

  tearing his hair in despair mr potts
dragged himself from his house to the
store and reopened it he had to ad-
mit even to himself that the company
had him nailed to the barn why
they were doing it he couldnt imagine

  in the meantime lawyer patterson
had been viewing the proceedings with
an apprehensive eye in his estimation
everything had gone to smash and the
trade at the store was irretrievably
ruined he felt that it was his duty to
apprise hugh cranson of the situation

  two days later hugh arrived in town
in high dudgeon

  what right have you got to sign
such a contract without my sanction
he indignantly demanded of mr potts

  aint it been pointed out to you that
im boss of this store retorted potts

it aint none of your business what i
do

  is that so returned hugh with
considerable heat you evidently over-
look the fact that you are under forty-
thousand-dollar bonds to the judge of
probate to see that my interest in this
establishment is kept intact until it is
either turned over to me or forfeited

i	think it is decidedly my business
when i come back here and find the
store gone to smash and the trade
cleaned out my interest is-or rather
was-worth twenty thousand dollars
and it is up to you to make good
this phase of the situation hadnt oc-
curred to mr potts he was liable for
hughs interest and would have to
make it good out of his own pocket in
case the business failed the trade was
indeed ruined not a customer re-
mained and as each of them held a per-
sonal grudge against him he doubted
if he would ever be able to get them
back the stock wouldnt bring forty
cents on the dollar at a forced sale and
even if it did there would not be
enough to pay hugh his share mr
potts was indeed in desperate straits
he thought deeply for a minute then
turned to the young man

  i reckon im licked so far as the
store is concerned he said i can
never get back the trade ive lost and
there is no use trying youre a bright
young man and mebbe you could do
something so if youll agree to it ill
turn the whole shootin match over to
you and get out

  do i understand by that that if i
release you from all liabilities so far as
my interest in the store is concerned
that you will turn it over to me abso-
lutely and step down and out

  i do averred mr potts glad to get
out of the muddle on any terms

  come along up to lawyer patter-
sons office said hugh promptly

chapter iv

squaring up

jyir potts heaved a sigh of relief
when the papers were at last
signed that released him from all re-
on the rocks of success



sponsibilities so far as the store was
concerned it was true that he had lost
his business and that he didnt have
much money left but if he had had to
make that twenty thousand dollars good
out of his own pocket it would have
ruined him absolutely as the matter
stood he felt that he had got out ex-
tremely easy for he was convinced that
the store was now not worth a dollar
so far as trade was concerned he felt
that he had got the best of hugh after
all

  his troubles were not over by any
means however three days later a
young man dropped off the train from
chicago and hunted him up

  i am an attorney representing the
quality products company he in-
formed mr potts i am here in the
matter of that contract

  i aint got nothin to do with it
averred mr potts ive turned over
my store and all my interests in it to
hugh cranson youll have to see
him

  you gave your personal bond in
that contract answered the lawyer
coldly mr cranson is not in any way
responsible for it youll have to make
good

  after they had threshed this out at
great length and with much heat in
mr pattersons office mr potts began
to see where the lawyers were right he
was still nailed to the barn

  i aint got ten thousand dollars
groaned the old man brokenly im
cleaned out why cant you fellers let
me alone

  we cant afford to lose the cost of
the free sampling we have done the
lawyer informed him but we dont
want to be too hard on you mr potts
and if you will make good the amount
the company has expended together
with my fee i think they will let the
matter drop

  how much will that be asked mr
potts

  about thirty-three hundred dollars
i reckon ill have to pay it said the
old man resignedly ill have the money
ready for you at three oclock

  he went to the bank and pat a mort-

gage on his home and paid the com-
panys claim it cleaned him out but
he was glad to get away with even a
mortgaged roof to sleep under truly
the fates had been extremely hard on
the parsimonious old man

  one day two months after these
events mr potts timidly entered his
old store a wonderful change had
taken place the old counters and
benches had vanished and in their
place were double-decked plate-glass
show cases electric lights had replaced
the old smoky lamps and the whole
interior had been redecorated until mr
potts hardly recognized the place

  the store was well filled with cus-
tomers and the clerks were busy mr
potts made his way to the rear where
he found hugh seated at a roll-top desk
writing a letter

  good morning hugh began the
old man hesitatingly

  the new proprietor glanced up with
a show of irritation busy he said
shortly sit down ill be through in
a minute

  mr potts winced but seated himself
in one of the new oak office chairs and
waited until hugh had finished writing
his letter

  well said the young man sudden-
ly spinning around in his swivel chair

  i-i was thinkin that mebbe you
needed another clerk faltered mr
potts if you do id be mighty glad
to get the job

  are those all the clothes you have 
questioned hugh coldly

  why-er-yes whats the matter
with em answered mr potts look-
ing down at his shabby garments

  theyre old and baggy and slovenly
go down to dobbins and get yourself
a decent suit then come back here and
hang up your coat and get to work
tell dobbins that ill stand for the suit
in case he wont trust you

  then youll give me a job cried
mr potts eagerly

  hugh contemplated the old man si-
lently for a minute then his manner
changed

  yes mr potts i am going to give


top-notch magazine

you a job and i am going to do better
than that he answered kindly i
think you have been punished enough
and i have not forgotten the fact that
you are my uncles old partner and that
you and he were associated in this busi-
ness for over forty years even if you
tried to fleece me out of my share of
this store by despicable methods i
matched my wits against yours mr
potts and i won i am the quality
products company i bought those
goods from the wholesale houses and
had them packed and labeled for me
and it was i who sent billy donaldson
down here to get that contract from
you i knew you would fall for it i
have beaten you and made you pay all
the expenses of the beating in the bar-
gain

  now he went on i am not going

to nag you any further but we are go-
ing to forget everything you can take
a position in the store and show me
hugh put a strong emphasis on the
me am at the end of one year if
you show yourself to be square and fair
with me i am going to give you back
your half interest in this store the
trade is building up again very nicely
since the change of management

  mr potts could hardly believe his
ears

  goin to give me back my store  he
murmurdd ecstatically goin to give
me back my store you dont mean it
hugh

  yes i do every word of it the
young merchant assured him and
now he said with a wave of his hand
you go along and get that new suit
and get into the harness again

                        training of seals
a ccording to an old trainer it is a very simple thing to teach seals the
 tricks they do in the ring

    the cardinal principle in training animals said he is not to attempt to
make an animal do anything contrary to the nature of its particular species to
be successful a trainer must know enough about the habits of the animals he has
under training to fit the tricks he would teach them to their natural bent

    the seal is very easily taught you begin with one seal some small pieces
of fish and a string you let the seal sit on his pedestal something he likes to do
by nature then you throw him one of the pieces of fish and he naturally and
easily catches it next you tie a piece of fish on the end of your string and
swing it toward the seal he catches this too and you keep moving away from
him and swinging the fish to him from an increasing distance now you are
ready to begin with the hat or cornucopia you put a piece of fish in the bottom
of it and toss it to the seal the seal is dexterous by nature and his nose quickly
detecting the fish in the tip of the cone seeks it out the cone catches on his
snout and he bites out the fish and tosses the cone aside before long he
comes to associate the cone with fish and he will catch any number of similar
ones and toss them aside wrhen he fails to find what he wants

    balancing the big rubber ball is based on the same principle the ball
is soaked in fishy brine and thrown to the seal he gets the odor and tries his
best to get into the ball and find what he is after this results in his balancing
the ball on his nose a feat to which his supple neck and his natural feeding habits
are all adapted and then he gets his piece of fish as a prize

the girl on the wire
the young man had talked for ten or fifteen minutes without a break when

	the girl at the other end of the wire interrupted

    just a moment guy she said

     what is it fleda 

    i want to change the receiver to the other ear this ones tired


making an induction coil

  the laboratory of the experimenter
with electricity is incomplete without an
induction coil while in commercial
work this device probably serves more
purposes than any other piece of elec-
trical apparatus the coil described
herein is large enough for a small wire-
less station it will give a spark fat
enough to ignite gunpowder even at a
considerable distance from the switch

  to make this device secure a card-
board tube of i inch inside diameter
and i foot long from i-inch pine cut
two blocks each  inches square and
bore a i-inch hole in the center of each 
slip the ends of the tube into these
holes and tack it to the wood from the
inside coat both tube and blocks with
shellac applying several coats allow-

ing each coat to dry put binding posts
or common wood screws into the blocks
as shown and the affair will look some-
thing like fig i

  the first or primary coil may now
be wound if you have a lathe fasten
the tube and blocks between centers
and winding will be an easy matter if
not winding by hand-is not hard al-
though a bit slow fasten one end of
the wire which should be no  in-
sulated to a binding post on one block
and wind a layer evenly on the tube
coat with shellac put on a layer of thin
paper and shellac that then wind an-
other layer and repeat the coats of
paper and shellac four layers in all
should comprise the primary coil and
the loose end should be fastened under
the other binding post of the same block
ioa

with which you started several layers
of paper should now be wound on and
liberally coated with shellac the use of
which throughout is to keep out mois-
ture which would be fatal to the proper
working of the coil

  the secondary coil which will re-
quire about two pounds of no- cop-
per wire insulated may now be wound
proceed exactly as for the primary coil
except that the start and finish are made
from the block at the opposite end of
the tube shellac and paper are applied
as before and when the last layer is in
place an extra heavy coating of each
should be used fig  shows the coil
wound but without the finishing coat
of paper

  for the base upon which the coil is
mounted secure a piece of wood 

inches long  inches wide and  inch
thick give it several coats of shellac
to keep out dampness if kiln-dried
wood is used for the mountings
throughout so much the better


top-notch magazine

  for the core a solid piece of soft
iron  inches long and i inch in di-
ameter may be secured  but it is easier
and perhaps even better to use no 
or no  soft-iron wire this should
be cut into pieces  inches long and
packed into the center of the tube until
the latter is filled the coil is now com-
pleted by gumming paper or cloth over
the tube ends and coating with shellac
as usual

  if carefully made this coil will prove
as efficient as any which might be pur-
chased and is of course very much
cheaper



spring platform lor exercise

  this is a handy thing for either in-
door or outdoor athletics as it is prac-
tical and portable the following lum-
ber is required for it

with the long hickory strips outside as
shown in the illustration and holding
them there by means of cleats these
cleats may be put on with small bolts
the tops of the bolts being countersunk
so that the bolt heads will not project
above the surface

  now comes the question of securing

the lady of the mine

artin douglas had just
seen the last of his luggage
placed safely aboard the
sumpter-taber gold-mine
stage and was on the point of
climbing into the coach himself when
a boy rode up on a wheel looked at him
a moment as if to make sure that he
was the man sought and handed over
a little yellow envelope with the ques-
tion  aint your name douglas 

  it sure is the engineer replied as
he signed for the telegram and hastily
opened it he read it hurriedly at first
expecting it to be nothing more than
additional instructions regarding the
work that was ahead of him he was
surprised to find it of an entirely dif-
ferent nature his face clouded and
his mouth was tightly drawn finally
he noted that the boy stood by waiting
for a reply

  there will be no answer douglas
told him tossing down a coin left to
himself he read the telegram through
again there was not much to it but
the contents perplexed him not a little
the wording was as follows

martin douglas granite ore or taber
   mine

  take my serious advice and throw up that
taber job its a bad proposition you may
not get out alive just talked with miner
from there the mine is tabooed cant
give details but dont go in drop it before
its too late	harry fields

  im sorry harry old friend the
engineer remarked to the yellow sheet
of paper you mean all right but i
cant take your advice im no quitter
im not going to give it up-not at this
stage of the game

  his brows were drawn closely to-
gether and something like a frown
overspread his clean-shaven face this
was the second time he had been ad-
vised to keep away from the taber the
first warning having come not more
than an hour before and from a man
who claimed to know all about the mine
but the advice of this man like that
of harry fields lacked details and
martin douglas was too practical too
determined to give serious attention to
fables

  within a few minutes the driver had
climbed to his seat of importance re-
ceived the whip and the lines and after
pulling the slouched hat to just the
proper angle over his left eye spoke a


top-notch magazine

word of command to the four horses
and the coach rolled out of town yet
a little while and they had struck the
mountains not pausing till the summit
of the divide was reached here the
driver brought the outfit to an abrupt
halt and called below

  there it is friend-thats the taber
mine take a squint at it

  the engineer looked out and noted
that the drivers whip pointed down-
ward toward a jumbled litter of tents
cabins and buildings at the base of the
fir-clad mountain one structure much
larger than the brood by which it was
surrounded leaned its generous red
roof against the hillside as if afraid of
falling into the vale below this was
the stamp mill its two tall stacks being
plumed with lazy clouds of smoke and
steam the thunder of its battery could
be plainly heard

  within a few minutes the driver
repeated a thousand bucks a month
wouldnt induce your uncle riley to
enter that mine an im an orphan with
nobody to mourn my demise he
shook his head dubiously and cracked
the long whip over the leaders the
coach reeled forward and whirled at
breakneck speed down the corkscrew
road

  number three douglas muttered
and i pass again wonder who will
be next he smiled grimly as he
thought of the dark suggestions of mys-
tery the meaning of which he could not
guess nor was he inclined to try
with the solution of riddles martin
douglas was not at present concerned
the main thing with him was that he
would soon be chief of the taber mine
-that he was to make practical use of
the education lately acquired his one
aim and purpose was to make good as
a mining engineer

  soon the rocking concord drew up
before the camp store ana post office
while the driver tossed down the mail
bags douglas who happened to be the
only passenger climbed out and
stretched his cramped limbs a dozen
or more flannel-shirted men lounged
idly on boxes and benches in front of
the store most of them casting curious

  glances in the direction of the new ar-
rival

  just across the taiiings-piied road
and almost opposite the store rose a big
wooden building which douglas guessed
was the boarding house and it was
toward this that he wended his way
carrying a part of his luggage and in-
structing the driver to bring over the
remainder before he had reached the
porch a young fellow whom the en-
gineer took to be the camp roustabout
intercepted him and asked if his name
was douglas

  thats the main part of it the en-
gineer replied

  youre the new supe aint you 
the young fellow inquired

  i hope to be douglas said

  the lady has a special cabin with
an office fixed up for you the roust-
about told him let me have some of
your stuff an fll tell pete to bring over
your trunk

  the engineer was relieved of a part
of his load and followed up the road
toward the mill finally halting before a
long low cabin that nestled under a
laurel near by was another cabin
which he took to be the office of the
bookkeeper and just beyond it still an-
other one whose rear end backed up
against the mill wall and which from
the array of bottles beakers and retort-
ing flasks that the engineer glimpsed
through the window he guessed to be
the laboratory of the mines assayer

  the roustabout unlocked the door
and gave douglas the key heres
where youll live and do your heavy
work he remarked then added mys-
teriously unless the taber gets you
some time when youre not lookin

  the engineer paid but little atten-
tion to the roustabouts concluding
statement frequent repetition had
made the thing grow tiresome more-
over he was immediately interested
in his quarters he found himself
in a well-appointed office the front
room of the cabin being fitted with a
massive desk a draft board stool
swivel chair and cabinets with plenty
of cubby-holes and files the floor was
rough but carpeted with the skins of
under the taboo

  bear lynx and cougar from the low
heavy-beamed ceiling hung two incan-
descent lamps which he guessed were
supplied with electric energy by the
mines own plant as it was growing
dark he turned one of them on

  many things were revealed that he
did not see before which indicated the
pains that had been taken for his re-
ception the cobblestone fireplace was
piled with wood and kindling ready for
a match and on the mantel was a
humidor filled to the brim with smoking
tobacco the engineer took his beloved
pipe from its case and laying it down
beside the bowl of fine cut smiled hap-
pily  for now the combination was com-
plete

  through an open door he saw the
rear room of the cabin and a bed
whose deep thick mattress was com-
fortably piled with warm blankets into
this room he took his luggage and a
few minutes later his trunk was un-
loaded on the porch he found the
roustabout waiting to assist in convey-
ing it to its destined place in the sleep-
ing apartment when this task was
done the roustabout informed him that
the lady wished to see him when he
had eaten supper thats her cabin
just across the way he added with
a jerk of his thumb

  the big brass gong at the boarding
house clanged the first call to supper
looking out the engineer saw the
miners filing across the road from the
bunk house-the night-shift men going
to mess the camp was ablaze now
with the glare of arc lamps and the
windows of the many cabins and build-
ings gleamed with light close by the
stamp battery pounded like a thousand
restless hoofs on a stable floor
douglas washed the dirt of travel from
his face and hands and joined the line
of hungry men

  its the new supe he heard one
man remark in low tones to an in-
quiring neighbor as they were seated
at the board his sojourn here will be
about as long as the dance of a grass-
hopper on a hot stove

  there was some laughter as the re-
sult of this and other remarks were

  made of a similar kind to all of which
the young engineer paid no heed he
enjoyed his beef beans and stewed
prunes with the heartiest of them and
proved to a goodly number that he was
not the stuck-up sort that they had
at first believed

  a half hour after supper when he
had made sure that his personal ap-
pearance was good enough to warrant
an audience with the lady owner and
manager of the mine he found himself
tapping on the door of the little cabin
that stood just across the road from his
own he knew the lady of the taber
by correspondence only but had pic-
tured her in his mind as a woman of
middle age a typical woman of the
west whose hair would be tinged with
gray and whose face would show the
lines of responsibility worry and care
she had signed her name as plain win-
nie mason and she was no doubt the
widow of a man who had at one time
owned the mine

  the door opened at once and a girl
of about twenty bright-eyed and smil-
ing greeted him her mass of copper-
brown hair scintillated in the lights be-
hind her she was attired in a house
gown as charming and modish as any
douglas had seen in the east

  the engineer was taken completely
by surprise he had not expected to
meet such a fascinating creature he
told himself at once that he had never
seen a prettier girl she must be--he
hoped she would prove to be-the
daughter of the lady

  i beg your pardon he said bowing
politely the owner of the mine wishes
to see me i am martin douglas and i
was directed to this cabin

  the young woman laughed merrily
and extended her hand i am the
owner of the taber she told him
my name is winnie mason come
in

chapter ii

the taber mystery

rouglas second surprise was a
greater-and a happier one-than
the first jet it was hard for the en-
gineer to believe that this young woman


top-notch magazine

-this rose-pink slip of a girl-could be
the owner and manager of the taber
mine

  the cabin was arranged in the mat-
ter of its rooms similarly to his own
but its furnishings were entirely differ-
ent it was much like stepping into the
bright cheerful study of a college girl
there was a soft velvet rug on the floor
the walls were daintily tinted and gayly
covered with pictures posters and pen-
nants there were big lazy chairs
waiting temptingly before a cozy fire-
place in which a cheerful fire blazed
and a mammoth leather couch in one
corner piled with pillows and cushions
the little desk that stood against the
wall heaped with a litter of papers let-
ters and documents was the only
feature of the room that indicated the
position of the occupant even this
might have been the working desk of a
student

  im glad you could accept the posi-
tion the girl told him as he seated
himself in one of the big chairs before
the fire i have been in need of a
superintendent for some time my fore-
man oliver judd though a competent
miner and a good manager of men is
not a practical mining engineer

  i hope that i will be able to give you
the assistance you need douglas re-
plied i havent the experience of
older men but i believe i can solve all
the problems that the taber will pre-
sent

  thats the kind of talk that pleases
me she said happily and let me
tell you right at the beginning that the
taber will have a few riddles for you
of a peculiar nature it was this fact
that made it difficult for me to find a
man who would accept the position
you were the third to whom this place
was tendered the first man got no
closer to the camp than sumpter the
second came to the mine remained
overnight and took the early-morning
stage i do not know whether the same
influences were exerted to turn you or
not if they were-

  i was advised to keep away he
told her simply but it was advice that
i could not heed

  the young woman gazed at him a
moment in silence her eyes beaming
and why couldnt you heed it she
asked

  because i am determined to in-
vestigate and learn for myself if it is
a problem in mining engineering it will
be to my advantage to solve it no mat-
ter how dangerous or difficult mar-
tin douglas spoke lowly but his words
were filled with determination and pur-
pose

 again the young woman beamed
upon him and after a pause she con-
tinued as if to put him thoroughly to
the test the thing that made the
mining engineers ahead of you turn
back is more than a problem-it is a
mystery

  if she had hoped to move martin
douglas to the slightest change of color
in his cheek or to word or gesture she
met disappointment he received her
statement with calm indifference and
finally asked

  three others were good enough to
offer a hint of this mystery but none
gave details perhaps you might be
good enough to tell me something of
its nature

  willingly she answered you
may not know that this mine was left
to me by my father who was acci-
dentally killed on the property some two
years ago oliver judd was foreman of
the taber at the time my father met
his death and has been in charge of
it ever since as general foreman and
boss of the crew there are very few
men in the crew now who were here
two years ago for mining men as a
class are a restless lot i mention this
that you may get an idea of the pe-
culiar nature of this so-called mystery
of the taber fraction

 the taber fraction douglas
broke in his eyes kindling with interest

  yes the taber fraction she an-
swered this property consists of one
full claim and a fraction the frac-
tion adjoins the taber proper on the
north and it was over there that the
original strike occurred this first
strike was very rich and considerable
underground work was done-a shaft
under the taboo



sunk and drifts run on two or three
levek my father had a partner in
those days but the partner died and
the old workings were subsequently
covered over and hidden but not till
they had completely filled with water
the girl paused a moment as if to
see what effect this would have upon
the engineer i understand he told
her finally and then she continued
the main shaft of the taber is now
down eight hundred feet and there are
almost two miles of underground work-
ings to follow the ore body it has
been necessary to extend the drifts well
over the line into the taber fraction
every day our main workings are get-
ting closer and closer to the old work-
ings  each time a drill is moved for-
ward or a blast set there is danger of
that subterranean lake breaking through
and flooding the mine drowning the
men and putting an end to the work
for a moment the happy spirit left
the girl her voice was filled with ap-
prehension and fear and something
came into her eyes that betrayed the
weight of her responsibility in spite
of herself the terror of this thing which
had made brave men turn their backs
upon the camp bore heavily upon her

  martin douglas was struck at once
with an earnest desire to help her-to
shoulder the load that was bearing her
down it seems to me that this should
not prove a very difficult thing he said
encouragingly your father must have
left a working chart of the old mine
showing the location of the shaft its

depth the length of drifts and-

  thats just the difficulty she hast-
ened to inform him if he ever had
any such chart it has been lost or de-
stroyed for it cannot be found neither
can any man be located who worked
with father on the taber fraction
this man oliver judd your fore-
man douglas started to ask did
he-

  he was not with my father when
the fraction was worked he knows of
it only by what was told him the girl
said

  who told him about the old work-
ings 

  my father judd says that the mat-
ter was mentioned a number of times
and that father feared the flooded shaft
and drifts might cause trouble i knew
nothing of it till about a year ago judd
had kept it quiet and the men worked
in the mine oblivious to the hidden dan-
ger then he said something about it
and from that time we have had great
difficulty in maintaining a crew when-
ever a water vein is struck the miners
rush out in terror nor can they be in-
duced to return mysterious under-
ground noises are sometimes heard
which are believed to be the sound of
gushing water and this causes a panic
the strikes lay-offs threats and other
disturbances have about put me on the
verge of desperation i do not know
what to do were it something tan-
gible something that i could see i
would not mind it for a moment but
it is the mystery of the thing that places
it beyond my comprehension

  again her face clouded the sparkle
left her eyes and an expression of
hopelessness and despair was printed on
her face and again the sympathy of
martin douglas was touched he be-
came more determined to prove himself
master of the situation

  by locating the old shaft he said
speaking as if there could be little dif-
ficulty about it it would require but a
few days to place a headframe and
double skip a big gasoline engine
could supply the power and by operat-
ing the two skips night and day the old
workings could be unwatered in six
weeks a surface pump would then
serve to keep them clear

  i wish it could be done she said
in the same tone of hopelessness

  it can be done he assured her it
must be done why did you send for
me  didnt you think that i might help
you 

  yes i did she told him suddenly
revived by his enthusiasm

  then leave the thing to me and
dont you worry any more about it
he rose as if to go he was in truth
anxious to begin when could i see
and have a talk with the foreman
not till morning she returned


top-notch magazine

he is on duty during the day shift and
the mine is in charge of the level boss
during the night you had better go
to your cabin have a good sleep and
take up the task with a fresh mind in
the morning

  very well he agreed that suits
me

  she leaped up buoyantly and became
once more the happy and apparently
carefree girl who had met him at the
door i feel better she told him t
feel certain that i have found the man
who can solve this problem you do
not realize what a burden has been
lifted from me

  and i am happy in the confidence
you show the engineer returned i
shall strive to prove myself equal to the
trust douglas would have told her
more had the courage been given him
looking down into her smiling face
and with the glow of her brown eyes
thrilling him he would gladly have said
that this task dark and dangerous
though it appeared to be was a pleas-
ure what did he care fof the mystery
if there were a dozen mysteries black
and sinister hovering over the taber
he would joyfully throw himself into
them all

  she walked with him to the door and
before bidding him good night once
again drew from him the promise that
he would go to his cabin and get a good
nights rest he turned away with a
vision of a young woman clad in a
dainty rose-pink gown her face radi-
ant and her wealth of copper-brown
hair scintillating in the soft glow of the
lighted room

  it was yet early evening and the
camp was wide awake brightly illu-
minated as a city street the roadways
and the cross-trails swarmed with men
the night shift was just going on and
the day men were filing from the mess
house well fed and boisterous lights
blinked from the cabin windows and
the miners rest a big frame building
near the store equipped with pool and
billiard tables card games and other
amusements for the crew buzzed like a
beehive

  douglas sauntered down to the door

and noted that the place was filled with
men and densely fogged with tobacco
smoke in the more quiet and secluded
corners of the big room a few miners
were reading books magazines and pa-
pep or trying to write letters to the
folks back home

  douglas strode in and mingled for a
time with the crowd he was keenly
aware of the curious glances thrown his
way and overheard several remarks of
which he was the subject though he
felt the dignity and importance of his
position as chief of the taber he de-
sired to win the good will of the men
they stood aloof however and seemed
averse to becoming acquainted this
was not at all in keeping with the free-
hearted spirit of the mines and the en-
gineer was at a loss to account for it

  after a time he left the place and
walked farther out toward the border
of the camp out there near the point
where the stage road entered darkness
prevailed the engineer felt in his coat
for his pipe and remembered that he
had laid it on the mantel of his cabin
beside the humidor of fine cut

  obliged to go without the desired
smoke he proceeded a short distance
farther and was brought to keen atten-
tion by the sound of voices down the
trail at first he believed the voices
were of men approaching and he
paused to let them pass but they got
ro closer apparently and when he had
stood a moment he discovered that two
men were standing in the black shadow
of an overhanging bluff almost directly
below him

  he would have paid no attention to
their talk but for the fact that he
seemed to be the subject of the con-
versation this matter of being the
topic for all the gossip of the camp was
getting on his nerves and making him
ill at ease his had always been the
plan of speaking out of keeping every-
thing aboveboard a desire to learn if
possible the reason for his being kept
in distrust by the miners held him in
silence

   yes he just got here to-night said
one in a deep bass voice

  arent you afraid he will get onto
under the taboo



the scheme and put the lady wise the
other asked in a tone of alarm

  not a bit of it the first one re-
plied hes young and inexperienced
an he wont last long one good scare
on the lower level will fix him good and
plenty

  i hope you can throw the scare into
him pretty soon for ive got my people
all primed for the deal and the sooner
wte can close it up the quicker can we
make our clean-up

  leave that to me the bass voice
said ill have scare number one hap-
pen to-night its quite likely that he
will load his trunk on the stage and
strike the road for sumpter to-mor-
row

chapter iii

a midnight call

ki artin douglas would hear no
more struck with sudden anger
he was seized with the impulse to ap-
proach the two men and make his
identity known he would have it out
with them and in the open as was his
way on second thought he concluded
that this might not be prudent or wise
he did not know who they were-did
not know for sure that they belonged
to the camp it was too dark for him
to distinguish them and their voices
were strange

  of one thing he was certain they
were talking about him and about the
taber two words had floated up to
him that caused suspicion these were
scheme and deal whoever they
were these men were mixed up in a
plot that concerned himself and the ta-
ber plans had been made no doubt
to take advantage of the young woman
who- owned the mine and he stood in
the way

  the engineer ground his teeth and
clenched his fists brutes he mut-
tered under his breath to take ad-
vantage of a girl i hope i am in the
way as for throwing a scare into me
-well turn loose im ready

  he turned back on the trail as quietly
as he had come leaving the two men
talking under the bluff he was con-
vinced now that all this behind-the-palm

talk meant something more than the
danger of a flooded mine it was some-
thing more evil more mysterious than
a mere problem in mining engineering

  no wonder winnie mason was wor-
rying her heart out it was a load far
too heavy for her to bear leave it
to me he said half aloud im itch-
ing for a fight and this thing suits
me

  he passed up the winding path to the
camp going by the miners rest which
still thronged with men from the mess
house came the clatter of dishes a
violin and a mouth organ whined and
wailed a mournful tune from a near-by
cabin the hoist engines sputtered and
coughed as they jerked the loaded
cages up the shaft and above all thun-
dered the mill

  douglas entered his cabin and turned
on-the light it was yet an hour before
bedtime so he touched a match to the
kindled pile of fuel in the fireplace
filled his pipe from the fresh bowl and
sat down before the cheerful blaze for
a peaceful smoke he threw off the
black depression that had assailed him
forgot the troubles promised for the
future and enjoyed to the full a happy
fascinating picture that had but re-
cently come to his mind

  the engineer had trained himself
never to let an unsolved problem keep
him awake when he went to his bed
it was for no other purpose than to
sleep so to-night when he stretched
himself at comfortable ease between the
thick blankets his head had no sooner
touched the pillow than slumber came
to him

  late in the night he awoke some
one was loudly pounding on his door
he leaped out jumped into a few of his
clothes and called who is it whats
wanted 

  im harter a voice replied the
night-shift boss youre wanted tip at
the mine

  all right ill be ready in a jiffy
the engineer told him whereupon he
got into his khaki clothes flannel shirt
and miners boots a moment later he
was at the door finding a short heavy-
set man standing on the porch


top-notch magazine

  i hate to call you out at this time
of night the shift boss said but the
devjl is loose on the lower level all
the men are out and i cant get them to
go down judd gave me strict orders
not to wake him till morning he was
in the mine about nine last evening and
told some of the men that there might
be trouble

  whats wrong douglas asked as
he started from the cabin and followed
harter up the winding trail toward the
shaft house the lights were all out
in the buildings and cabins and the
camp was in darkness save for the
sputtering glare of a single arc lamp
near the mill

  its a break at the end of the lower
drift-over against the fraction the
shift boss explained

  is the water coming in

  spurting like a bulkhead harter
returned in a tone of alarm the rock
is slipping too were on soft ground
over there

  reaching the shaft house they found
all of the night crew except those who
had been placed on the upper levels
standing idly round the headframe
many of them still wore their rubber
coats and held to their candlesticks
though a number had gone to the
change room and made ready to quit
the mine for the night all glanced up
with surprise when the young engineer
came among them as douglas had
never been down in the taber he knew
nothing whatever of the mine and could
only judge of the condition below by
the expression of terror on the faces of
the men

 the crowd gave way and he ad-
vanced directly to the cage i want
two men he announced turning about
and looking steadily into the eyes of
those around him

 what for one man wanted to
know

  to prop up the drift the engineer
replied i think there must be a break
in the rock

  you bet theres a break in the rock
the same voice answered and a hun-
dred men couldnt prop it up

  it must be propped up douglas

said sternly his black eyes flashing
come quick two of you

  the little shift boss came over and
entered the cage one more man
called the new superintendent

  but the men held back its  use
said one shes cornin down fast
the waters pourin in like a flood
through a flume

  the stubbornness of the crew drove
the engineer to anger had he been
longer among them he would have given
expression to his feelings but prudence
demanded extreme caution at this time
and by an effort he controlled himself

  very well he told them harter
and i will go down alone all of the
night men will remain here till we re-
turn if the lower level is safe you
will go on dutv again and finish the
shift

  there was a ring of authority of
leadership and undaunted courage in
the young superintendents words
this was recognized instantly the
crew changed at once from their state
of obstinacy if they could not obey
they wrould at least await a further
order moreover they wanted to test
the mettle of the young fellow who had
attempted to command

  douglas pulled the hell wire and gave
the signal to down-eight

  the cage dropped instantly the
station levels flitted by all of them elec-
tric-lighted deserted and silent save the
fifth from which came the distant clat-
ter of an air drill

  part of the night crew are on this
level the shift boss remarked they
feel safe

  on the eighth level they suddenly
stopped with a jerk it was dark down
there and hot for the rocky passages
were filled with steam fogging the in-
candescent lamps and making it difficult
to breathe water was dripping every-
where and running in streams along the
tunnel floor off in the distance it
could be heard to splash and gurgle as
if an underworld cataract were tearing
through the mine

  harter had pulled two candlcsticks
from a station post stuck in fresh can-
dles and lighted them he passed one
under the taboo



to the superintendent  in the yellow
glow of the little flame the face of the
shift boss shone ghastly pale his hand
trembled nervously when he gave
douglas the candle

  follow me he directed the break
is at the end of this drift

                                              

chapter iv

the break

tyduglas and harter followed the
car track passing under the ore
chutes that dropped down from the
stopes up in these the men had been
at work all of the stopes appeared to
have been deserted in wild panic can-
dles half spent sputtered from sticks
whose beaks clung to the jagged quartz
drills picks and shovels were scat-
tered in confusion two ore cars
partly filled remained under a spout

  halfway down the drift they came to
the pump station underneath this was
the sump a huge underground reser-
voir into which all of the water of the
mine was drained the big pump un-
manned kept up its rhythmic beat the
heat was intense here for the escaping
steam came from the station being first
delivered to the lower level through
an asbestos-incased pipe from the
power house on the surface

  how is the sump douglas asked
when the two entered the station

  harter crossed the room held his
candle up near a big-figured gauge and
replied shes within three feet of the
top thats more than ten above low
water

  is the pump holding it down

  no she aint and thats the devil of
it the water has gained three feet
since the beginnin of the shift at this
rate the whole lower level will be
flooded within twelve hours the ex-
pression of terror on harters face be-
came intensified his words were filled
with an overwhelming fear he turned
to the young engineer and exclaimed
do you know young fellow what
were up against 

  i know that weve got a wet mine
to keep drained douglas replied
calmly

   its worse than that harter re-
 turned hoarsely were borin into a
 hole of water big enough to fill the ta-
 ber to the rim i think this drift is
 within a yard of it right now

   oh come brace up douglas said
 encouragingly for he noted that the
 shift boss was on the verge of despair
 lets take a look at the drift

   without waiting for harter to show
 the way the engineer left the station
 and continued his walk along the track
 six hundred feet from the level station
 he reached the face of the drift the
 splash of water and the groan of slip-
 ping rock and earth though sounds that
 would have attracted but little attention
 on the surface when confined to the
 narrow rock-bound chamber seemed
 almost deafening

   a long slit was exposed across the
 face of the drift and from this the
 water gushed as if through a leak in a
 gigantic reservoir douglas ran up un-
 der the slipping maw and jabbed his
 candlestick into the rock then he ex-
 amined it hurriedly but with a careful
 eye he wanted to know if that stream
 gushed merely from a vein that would
 soon spend itself or came from a hid-
 den sump

  the shift boss tremblingly ap-
 proached and stood by in silence he
 saw the engineer thrust exploring hands
 into the break saw him pull slabs of
 quartz from the vein and hold them up
 near the light he wondered at this
 but wondered most of all when the
 young superintendent put his mouth to
  the gushing fountain and tasted of the
 water

   douglas whirled about instantly full
 of life and action he had reached a
 decision and a course of procedure was
 full upon his mind

   that water is pure he shouted
 its just an underground vein but we
 must prop up this drift its coming
 down run back to the cage and ring
 for timbers

   the shift boss turned and ran down
 the drift leaving the superintendent
 pulling at the quartz with bare hands
 yet a little while and a load of stulls
 came down the shaft moreover a


top-notch magazine

crowd of men came also and swafmed
along the drift bearing the timbers on
their shoulders they had recovered
from the first shock of their fright and
their courage had been renewed by the
cool behavior and lack of fear of the
superintendent

  thats the stuff men i douglas
cried cheerfully as he saw them com-
ing and stood by to let them pass

  jacks were brought with the timbers
and seizing one of these the engineer
helped drive the stulls home as they
were passed up from behind the men
worked like trojans all of them in the
oppressive atmosphere of the tunnel
within an hour the creaking and grind-
ing ceased the slip settled firm on its
new foundation the engineer was the
last to leave the drift and as he turned
away he noted with extreme satisfaction
that the water no longer gushed from
the vein it merely dribbled down the
face half exhausted he tottered back
along the drift pausing at the pump
station for a glance at the gauge the
sump was being lowered the report
of this coupled with the engineers as-
surance that the mine wras safe drove
all remaining fear from the night crew
loaded with men the cage brought all
of those who had remained on the sur-
face and all went to their places in the
stopes to complete the shift

  now that he was down in the mine
the superintendent finished the night in
an examination of all the lower work-
ings going from level to level when
he emerged from the shaft day wras
breaking the mill whistle shrieked the
change of shift and the brass gong
clanged the first call to morning mess
he went to his cabin changed his
clothes and filed down with the men to
the boarding house

  he was shown to a special table that
wras set apart from those around which
gathered the crew this little table
differed from the others not only in
size but in the cleanliness of its linen
and the polish of its silver-plated
knives forks and spoons douglas
pleasantly declined the favor and seat-
ed himself with the crew he had
noted that the little table was spread

for two and as curious to know who
would be the other man he kept his
eye on the corner and saw a dapper
flaxen-haired young fellow who wore
eyeglasses a high collar and a general
air of importance strut in and take one
of the reserved seats

  shortly after breakfast he saw this
young fellow rap at the door of miss
masons cabin the girl appeared and
handed out a bundle of letters which
the flaxen-haired man took at once in
the direction of the post office douglas
concluded that he must be the mines
bookkeeper

  the engineer had given the roust-
about orders to find oliver judd the
foreman and inform him that the su-
perintendent desired a meeting as early
as possible that morning in the latters
cabin within an hour and while
douglas was getting his books papers
and surveying instruments in order
there came a heavy footfall on the
porch followed by an equally heavy rap
on the door when the engineer opened
it he found before him a man who
corresponded in every way to the tread
and the rap he was big tall and
powerful with unusually long arms and
heavy hands he wore miners boots
and a corduroy suit underneath the
low-drawn slouched hat glittered a pair
of black eyes small and close set his
face was covered with a dark bushy
beard

  im judd the foreman he an-
nounced you wanted to see me

  the engineer gave a slight start for
the voice was the deep bass he had
heard while standing on the trail at
the border of the camp the evening be-
fore-the voice of the one who had said
that one good scare on the lower level
would fix the kid good and plenty

  a host of thoughts ran riot through
his brain he was seized on the in-
stant with the belief that the foreman
was connected in some way with the
mystery of the taber fraction he
was at least an active party in a plot
that vitally concerned the mine

  yes i want to see you douglas
hastened to tell him come in a while
and well talk things over
under the taboo



  the big fellow strode in but seemed
ill at ease on the rug-covered floor he
went over and leaned against the
mantel waiting for the engineer to state
the business of the meeting

   in the first place i want to ask that
you bring me the surveyors charts and
working diagrams of the taber
douglas requested i suppose you
have a number of them showing the lo-
cation of levels drifts and all under-
ground workings

  yes i have the foreman answered
i must have them in order to get a
line on the work that has been done
and to proceed intelligently with the de-
velopment i would like also to ask if
you have or know anything about an
old working chart of the taber frac-
tion 

  oliver judd did not at once answer
he shifted his weight uneasily from one
foot to the other then gazed at douglas
as if the question were not fully un-
derstood the taber fraction he
asked what do you mean by that
i mean the portion of the taber on
which mason made the original strike
i understand that you know something
of it

  i dont know anything about a work-
ing chart the foreman replied

  do you know anything about the
old workings

  very little oliver judd said
speaking as if he were making a con-
fession it was plainly evident that he
resented these pointed questions of the
new superintendent and was keenly
averse to answering them

  but you do know that the lower
north drift is getting under the taber
fraction that the old workings are filled
with water and that the taber itself
is in great danger of being flooded

  i think there is some danger yes
the foreman said

  the men of the crew who got their
belief in the existence of the old water-
filled workings from you must think
there is a lot of danger anyway the
entire lower-level crew fled from the
mine last night and i couldnt get them
to go down till the shift boss and i had
made an investigation

  what did i have to do with that
the foreman demanded with sudden
anger he took a step from the fire-
place and glowered upon the engineer
the later remained in his seat per-
fectly calm and unperturbed

  you passed the word around when
in the mine about nine oclock that
there might be trouble before morn-
ing

  the foremans black eyes were
gleaming wickedly but douglas looked
into them unflinchingly when he told
him this

  what if i did didnt i have a
right to tell em that if i thought it was
so the foreman demanded his wrath
increasing

  now see here judd the superin-
tendent cut in sitting up in his chair
and looking the big fellow in the face
its a foolish waste of time for us to
quarrel or go on in this rambling way
what i wish to learn is the amount of
definite information you have regarding
the old taber fraction workings

  what good would it do you oliver
judd asked his anger still uncooled

  as superintendent of the mine it
might possibly be quite helpful to me
douglas assured him you have been
foreman a number of years and cer-
tainly ought to know the property thor-
oughly as i have been given the posi-
tion of superintendent it will be to our
advantage to work in harmony neither
should keep from the other anything
that relates to the operation of the ta-
ber

  im not keepin back anything
judd repeated with dogged persistence

  i sincerely hope you are not the
superintendent returned so i will
think that you had nothing to do with
the scare given the crew last night i
made a careful examination of the
break and am satisfied that the water
came only from a vein

  how can you tell the difference be-
tween vein water and that from hidden
workins  the foreman wanted to
know

  very easily douglas answered
in the first place there is the nature
of the break itself this one was a


top-notch magazine

long narrow slit proving it to be an
opening or fissure that served as a
natural underground watercourse but
the simplest test of all is to taste the
water that from an old mine would
be stagnant this was pure and sweet
and so you believe that the mine
is safe judd asked

  yes i believe it is safe i have
gone over it thoroughly douglas an-
swered and the crew shall be ad-
vised of my belief as superintendent
i must demand that you keep silent re-
garding the matter there has been
too much said about it already the
superintendent was on his feet now and
speaking in the calm but forceful tone
of a leader

  how about the old workings dont

you think-

  i think they do not exist douglas
told him frankly he turned to his
desk as if the matter had been definitely
settled

  oliver judd shambled to the door
hesitating a moment with his hand on
the knob he looked toward the super-
intendent with an expression on his
grizzled face that indicated a further
question on his mind whicl he lacked
the courage to speak douglas bent
over the desk and became busily en-
gaged with the papers before him so
the foreman went out slamming the
door

chapter v

the bookkeepers discovery

chortly after judd left douglas
 rose and began pacing back and
forth across the cabin though he had
presented a bold front to the foreman
the engineer was deeply troubled he
had spoken the truth when he said that
he believed the mine was safe for the
present but as for the future that was
a different matter

  it is an old old adage among miners
that no man can guess beyond the
point of the pick and this applies as
truly to the possible striking of water
as to the uncovering of treasure so
the superintendent had no means of
knowing what lay ten feet or a yard

beyond the face of the lower north
drift he had told oliver judd that he
believed the much-talked-of old work-
ings did not exist and so far as his
observations in the mine could prove
this statement was true he knew ab-
solutely that the water pouring into the
lower level sump though great in vol-
ume came from no other source than
that of fissures and rock veins in the
parlance of the west the taber was a
wet mine

  this veiy fact however increased
the danger for if the old taber frac-
tion workings did exist they must cer-
tainly be filled with water with no
charts no diagrams no engineers maps
or drawings of any sort not even a
single scrap of definite information con-
cerning the fabled claim how was he
to locate it or prevent the lower drifts
from breaking through strangely
enough all the pay chutes of the ore
body extended over into the taber
fraction and all subsequent work must
be done in that direction there was
nothing to be done but go on blindly
trusting to luck and taking a miners
chance

  it was during his troubled state of
mind that he heard the pounding of
hoofs on the road and looking out saw
a man and a woman riding mountain
ponies gallop through the camp and
approach the cabin at first he took
them to be strangers but when they
came closer he saw that the woman was
the young lady of the mine and her
escort the dapper flaxen-haired fellow
who sat at a special table for mess for
some reason douglas had taken a dis-
like to the fellow mainly because of his
pompous air this dislike now became
intensified

  he was in the act of lighting his pipe
when he heard one of the horses come
to a halt before his cabin and a young
womans voice called hello mr
douglas

  he replaced the pipe on the mantel
and went to the door miss mason
mounted on her pony greeted him
cheerfully

  how are you this morning she
asked and before he could make reply
under the taboo



went on cheerily i heard about the
difficulty you had last night and of
your getting the crew to go down after
the break that was good work
her words were free from flattery
but the ring of sincerity in her tone
drove the depression from the en-
gineers mind her smile made him
forget his troubles on the instant he
would gladly have faced danger and
suffered the hardships of the night just
to hear her tell him this-that he had
done good work

  i learned something this morning
that makes me happy she continued
and which you will no doubt be glad
to hear jason the bookkeeper with
whom i have been out riding told me
that he had found an old working chart
of the taber fraction he uncovered
it among a lot of rubbish in his office
i am glad to hear it douglas re-
turned enthusiastically it certainly
looked as if this would be a good day
for him with such a chart in his pos-
session he could soon locate the exact
position of the old workings if they
really existed

  i told him to have it ready for you
this morning miss mason said so
you can see it at any time

  i will go over at once and take the
necessary data from the chart then fll
make a survey this afternoon he re-
turned i will possibly be able to re-
port to you this evening on the position
of the fraction shaft and drifts and
whether our lower level is in danger
that will be fine she declared her
face lighting i shall expect to see you
after supper

  you may depend upon me he as-
sured her

  she reined her horse back into the
road and the engineer went at once to
the bookkeepers office he opened the
door and entered a room heated to suf-
focation for the cabin was tightly
closed and a hot fire roared in the stove
jason was seated on a high stool be-
fore a desk and barely took the trouble
to turn his head when douglas came in

  miss mason says that you have
found an old working chart of the ta-
ber fraction the superintendent be-

gan without introduction i would
like to see it

  the bookkeeper took ample time to
finish adding a column of figures then
gave douglas a long squinting stare
as if to make sure he was not being
imposed upon and without a word he
slid off the stool and opened the safe
from this he drew a roll of soiled pa-
per spreading it on the desk for the
engineer to examine thats it he
said

  first let me make a motion for
more air douglas remarked as he
turned and opened the door this of-
fice is worse than the lower-level pump
station

  he came back and made a close ex-
amination of the ancient chart it
proved to be an old survey or map
bearing a date in the lower right-hand
corner more than twelve years old it
not only indicated the original lines of
the taber fraction but of the taber
claim as well also it showed the loca-
tion of the old shaft and of the three
drifts that appeared to have been run
with notebook and pencil the superin-
tendent took down the more important
data-enough to give him a working
basis for a survey-then rolled up the
chart and placed it in jasons hand

 i have no safe in my cabin
douglas told him and for the present
at least this must be kept secure i will
probably want to see it again late this
afternoon

  the engineer left hurriedly forget-
ting to close the door putting the dap-
per jason to the trouble of shutting it
himself douglas was highly elated
for he had found on the old chart the
information of which he stood in urgent
need according to the old surveythe
lines of which had been indicated and
drawn in ink there were a thousand feet
of underground workings in the taber
fraction most of this was represented
by the shaft itself from which a short
drift was run and this old shaft
whose collar had been purposely cov-
ered over and hidden stood but a short
distance from the main taber line

  calling two helpers from the crew
douglas took his surveying instruments


top-notch magazine

and began running his lines his ob-
ject was first to make a hurried sur-
vey then check it up by a more care-
ful one on the morrow he found the
claim stakes and the fraction claim
stakes as indicated and by early after-
noon had made a complete survey of
the property

  with the data thus secured he took
the working charts of the taber which
oliver judd had brought over and cal-
culated the position of the old work-
ings so keenly interested was he in
the problem and so anxious to have it
over that he did not hear the mess
gongs call to dinner seated at the
draft board with a green shade pulled
low over his eyes he worked with fe
verish haste through the afternoon
madly his pencil flew across the paper
placing a line here a dot there and tiny
figures everywhere

  as he neared the conclusion the ex-
pression of happiness slowly left his
face to be replaced by one of keen
anxiety it was not working out as he
had hoped his worst fears seemed
certain of realization and finally
when the last figure had been placed he
jerked off the green shade threw down
the pencil and with a glare of horror
in his tired eyes exclaimed aloud

  its awful flow can i tell her that
the lower-level drift is already within
three feet of an underground sea

chapter vi

the affair in the office

there was a possibility that he was

	wrong-that his calculations were
in error this possibility was remote
however for rapidly as he had worked
douglas checked up his figures as he
went along

  to assure himself that he was right
he took his field book and the newly
finished map picked up his hat and
started for the bookkeepers cabin
dusk was falling and already darkness
filled the vale for it was early winter
and night at this season drops quickly
in the mountains the arc lamps were
not yet lighted but several of the cabin
windows were glowing

  the bookkeepers quarters were but
a short distance from his own and he
had proceeded only a little way when
he was startled by a sound like that of
a heavily falling body this was fol-
lowed by the trample of feet a muffled
shout and a crash of broken glass the
disturbance seemed to come directly
from jasons cabin the windows of
which remained dark it occurred to
the engineer that if the bookeeper were
still at work a light would be burn-
ing over the desk

  he struck forward on a run dashed
across the little porch and threw open
the door the air of the room was as
bad as he had found it that morning
he was struck with the truth of this
when he entered but he found the
room dark and quiet ominously quiet
it seemed to him

  at first he believed that jason had
gone out and that the noise he had
heard had come from some other cabin
near by yet he had been absolutely
certain that it came from the book-
keepers quarters since it was too dark
to- distinguish any object in the room
the engineer struck a match with which
to find the incandescent lamp

  when the little light flared up it re-
vealed a picture of disorder chaos and
confusion which brought a cry of
alarm from the engineer the table
had been overturned the desk upset
and papers books and records scat-
tered over the floor the safe door
stood ajar and it was evident that a
struggle had occurred just as the
match burned out and fell from his fin-
gers douglas heard a muffled groan
from a corner and had a glimpse of ja-
son bound and gagged and tightly
strapped to the desk stool

  the superintendent found the electric
light and turned it on going at once to
the mans assistance jasons clothes
were half torn from his body his face
was bruised and bleeding

  douglas removed the gag and the
straps lifting him up wthats wrong
jason he asked hurriedly tell me
quick

  i was attacked-the bookkeeper
manager to say--from behind
under the taboo



knocked down and tied i tried to
fight him off but he was a big fellow
who was it douglas inquired

  i couldnt see said jason it was
dark

what did he want  and did he get

anything-did he rob-

he took the chart-the survey of

the old workings-

  the blasted thief douglas shouted
as he let go his hold upon jason and
ran over to the safe he opened the
door wider and looked carefully in-
side a tray of coin a roll of bills
several papers and documents lay un-
disturbed  but the roll of soiled paper
that the bookkeeper had placed there
that morning was gone somebody had
stolen the only absolute record and
proof of the taber fraction

  though roughly handled jason was
not badly hurt and was soon able to
stand on his feet he presented a sorry
appearance however and started at
once for his sleeping roombehind the
office with the evident intention of
changing his clothes

  the engineer followed him in are
you sure he took the chart he asked

  yes im sure of it the bookkeeper
replied

  and cant you tell me anything
about him-didnt you get a chance to
see his face douglas was desperately
trying to get some sort of clew

  it was dark jason said again he
was a big fellow

  and he escaped through this room
the superintendent added as he exam-
ined the broken pane of the rear bed-
room window i heard the crash of
breaking glass only a minute before
entering the office

  douglas attempted to get further in-
formation regarding the assailant from
jason but that badly ruffled young man
could tell him nothing more than that
he was a big fellow and had made
the unexpected attack from behind in
the growing darkness of the cabin

  after questioning him closely
douglas was convinced that jason
knew more than he would reveal
while it had been dark in the office for
almost an hour before the robbery it
na

was not so dark but that objects were
distinguishable anywhere in the room
especially to one inside accustomed to
the gloom it did not seem likely that
any one could have entered tied and
gagged the bookkeeper and stolen the
chart without being recognized

  the affair was peculiar and only
added to the confusion that jumbled
the engineers mind he was satisfied
that the old map had been stolen for
no other purpose than to obliterate all
existing information concerning the
mysterious taber fraction the thief
was necessarily interested in keeping
the location and position of the old
workings a mystery reasoning on this
line the engineer was not long in form-
ing a conclusion he believed he could
place his hand on the man who had
stolen the chart

  unable to get anything more from
the bookkeeper douglas went out
through the broken window pausing
just outside and striking a match to
make an examination of the ground
prints of large miners boots were
plainly visible bearing out jasons one
positive utterance that the thief was a
big fellow by striking several
matches the superintendent followed
the tracks round the cabin to an un-
used trail and along the trail to the
much-traveled tailings-piled road here
they were lost

  night was now fully on and during
the time that douglas had been in the
bookkeepers cabin the shift whistle
had sounded the mess gong clanged
and the day men had filed in for sup-
per the superintendent remembered
that he had not eaten dinner and
though the unsolved problem clamored
for a solution he was determined to
satisfy his hunger before going another
step into the mystery

  nearly all the seats at the main table
were filled when douglas entered the
dining room but a place was found for
him on one of the long benches be-
fore sitting down he glanced up and
down the rows of men and was satis-
fied that the one he sought was not in
the mess hall

  just as he began work on a heaping


top-notch magazine

plate of beef and beans the foreman
came in it so happened that there was
not a single vacant seat except the one
opposite the superintendent and to this
seat judd was directed by a waiter he
came over at once as if to sit down
but hesitated suddenly and turned as
if to leave

  come on in come on in called a
grizzled digger good-humoredly no
use lookin for a better place heres
where the high bloods always eat

  sure thing another one declared
taking the foreman by the coat tail and
pulling him over

  then oliver judd lifted his huge feet
over the bench and squeezed in get-
ting busy immediately with the mining-
camp fare not once did he raise his
eyes or look across the table and
douglas who bad been observing him
keenly took note of two long fresh
cuts across the top of the broad right
hand

  judd ate ravenously and finished his
supper with those around him douglas
did not hurry and left the dining hall
when the night men had all gone out
and the day shift was coming in a
crowd was filling the brightly lighted
miners rest so he sauntered down and
entered the place

  oliver judd was chalking a billiard
cue and getting ready for a game at
one of the tables the superintendent
passed on to the rear of the room and
idly toyed with a deck of cards but kept
his eyes all the time on the four billiard
players

  he saw the roustabout enter the door
and stand for a time just inside survey-
ing the crowd the fellow was breath-
ing hard as if he had been running and
there was an expression of terror on
his face douglas saw him walk over
and touch judd on the arm speaking
something in his ear the foreman
with no apparent concern jerked a
thumb in the direction of the card table
where douglas sat

  then the roustabout came back and
drawing close to the engineer said
hoarsely his voice filled with fear

  theres another break at the end of
the lowerdrift all the men are out

and not even harter will go down
judd told me to see you

  douglas dropped the cards shoved
back his chair and rose stiffly to his
feet for a time the big room with its
crowd of flannel-shirted men the green-
covered tables the reading desks and
chairs floated dizzily before him only
by a supreme effort could he stand
erect

  another break on the lower drift
he muttered then his calculations of
the day must have been correct he
had hoped to verify his findings but
now it was too late with only a yard
between the face of the drift and that
underworld sea it had required but a
little while for the drills to bore
through they had struck the old work-
ings of the taber fraction certain
destruction threatened the mine 

chapter vii

a test of nerve

the roustabout had spoken in low

	tones only the two men who re-
ceived the message heard him speak
when douglas looked across the room
he saw judd pause to chalk the billiard
cue again the foremans slouched hat
was pulled low over his face but un-
derneath the drooping brim the small
black eyes glittered wrickedly the en-
gineer felt the piercing gaze and knew
what it meant

  he thinks im afraid douglas said
to himself he thinks im afraid to go
down well if this is to be a test of
nerve well see who is the better man
then he turned to the roustabout who
stood near by and spoke aloud ill
go up at once we must hold the
break

  judds dark gaze followed him across
the room and the engineer without a
pause went out into the night reach-
ing the trail he broke into a run fully
realizing that there was no time to lose
even though the break should prove but
another fitful burst of a water vein un-
less the slip were propped up the lower
level would be choked and development
in that direction blocked for a month

  he found all of the lower-level men
under ti-ie taboo



huddled around the shaft they had
been driven from the mine by the sink-
ing wall and the inrushing flood and
it was plainly evident that they had no
intention of going down again

  as on the night before several of
them remained with candles in their
hands but a greater number had
thrown off their ponchos douglas
walked directly to the cage the crew
gazed at him in wonderment

  i want a man to go down with me
he called

  there was no response the men
held back it was too much like court-
ing death

  whats the use one murmured
an army couldnt catch up with er
now

 we must catch up with her
douglas shouted i want just one
man come be quick 

  not one came forward he must
take us for fools one old digger mut-
tered aloud

  youre worse than that the super-
intendent returned hotly youre a
pack of cowards seized with an un-
controllable rage he raised a clenched
fist and yelled ill go down alone
he pulled the bell wire and gave the
signal for the cage to sink

  at this instant there was a sudden
commotion in the crowd a big man
broke through from the rear and
shouted hold a second im no
coward ill go down

  just as the gate was closing a man
charged up and leaped on the platform
and as they dropped douglas became
aware of a tall powerful fellow stand-
ing beside him in the cage as they
flitted past a lighted station the super-
intendent looked up into the other
mans face he found himself gazing
into the black piercing eyes of oliver
judd

  he was too amazed for speech and
the swift downward journey was com-
pleted in silence on the lower level
the two stepped out lighted their can-
dles and struck a fast pace down the
drift douglas took the lead

  beyond tf pump station thick dark-
ness prevailed the whole lower level

was shaking as if in the grasp of an
earthquake all around and above the
mountains heart throbbed and palpi-
tated loosening the earth and dropping
quartz and broken shale to the tunnel
floor

  the noise was deafening water
poured from everywhere-from the
drift roof from fissures in the walls
and even gushed up from below the
two men were drenched with it they
waded in a swift-rushing underworld
stream grimly silently they pushed
along the drift protecting the fluttering
candles with their hands

  above the roar and rush of waters
sounded the crack of breaking timbers
huge stulls creaked and groaned as in
the agony of despair under their mighty
load of sinking ground now and then
a smaller prop broke with a snap and
a report like a rifle shot the great
gaping stope that opened upward into
the bowels of the underworld spilled
quartz from its yawning maw as if im-
pelled by a great unseen hand

  it was a thing to test the nerve of
real men once douglas paused be-
lieving he had been left alone but on
looking back he saw the huge form of
the foreman following just behind

  finding a sheltering rock the super-
intendent jabbed in his candlestick and
ran forward to examine the face of the
drift the water gushed through as on
the night before the real danger
seemed not so much from the flood as
from the breaking ground

 we must get more props under
her he shouted

  sure the foreman responded ill
ring for timbers

  the two of them ran back to the level
station and sent up a hurry call for
stulls and jacks in a little while the
cage dropped with a load of braces
but no men came down douglas and
judd were left to fight it out alone
each lifted a brace of stulls and struck
up the drift

  douglas climbed into the snapping
maw of the stope-into the very jaws
of death

  pass up the timbers he com-
manded ill drive them home

while he wedged in the load they had
brought judd ran back for more load
after load was handed up and ham-
mered in

  all the while the shrieking grinding
din increased in fury the mountain
kicked and plunged it was as if de-
mons were holding carnival in the ta-
bers labyrinths

  with a thousand odds against them
the two men worked on desperately de-
terminedly grimly it was two men
against an avalanche-two men prop-
ping up a toppling mountain

  little by little they gained ground
slowly the creaking and grinding
ceased and finally the hanging wall be-
came quiet heavier timbers were piled
at the base with a final groan the
mountain settled firm on its new
foundation

  wrhen satisfied that enough had been
done to hold the slip the two men tot-
tered down the stope toward the drift
but at that moment a break occurred
near the maw judd saw it coming
seized a stull and quickly drove it un-
der the slip broke in twain just as
the timber was placed beneath

  then followed a terrific crash as if
the earth was torn apart black dark-
ness filled the stope

  the maw was choked with tons of
crumbled shale both men were thrown
fiat upon the quartz-strewn floor they
were cut off from the open tunnel by
an impenetrable barrier of rock and
granite

  the splash and gurgle of running
water the distant chugging of the
pump the creaking of timbers-all the
sounds of the underworld were sud-
denly shut from them it was as if
they had been thrown into a dungeon
and a mammoth door closed upon them

  the stuils they had driven in place
held the wall and prevented the chok-
ing of the mine also they prevented
the lives of the two men from being
pinched out the engineer lay a long
while gasping for breath then by a
painful effort he began working him-
self free of the mass of loose shale that
pinned his body to the floor bruised
bleeding his strength nearly gone he

finally pulled himself out and dropped
on top of the pile

chapter viii

under stress

iouglas thrust a fumbling finger
 into the pocket of his jacket
and found a match he lighted it and
looked around the match burned only
an instant but in that short time the
entire situation was revealed-the stone
vault with its walls of unguessable
thickness and the piles of loose shale
from one of the piles two big boots
protruded at the other side of the
pile were the head and arms of oliver
judd

  the light wrent out and douglas
crawled over toward the pile he
clawed with bare hands at the heap
of broken rock that pinned the foreman
down finally he uncovered the big fel-
lows body

  he put his ear to judds heart and
found that he was alive hello he
called wake up judd

  the foreman made no reply by a
great effort the engineer turned him
over he lighted another match and
called again then the foreman opened
his eyes there was no glitter in his
gaze and when he saw the superintend-
ent bending over him he lifted a hand
in protest dont mind me fm all
right the deep bass voice trembled
huskily

  judd raised up uttering a groan and
before the match went out looked
around i guess were here for
keeps he mumbled

  looks that way douglas agreed
dropping the match

  the foreman turned over on his back
taking a more comfortable position i
feel just like an elephant had sat down
on me good and heavy are you
hurt 

  not much the engineer answered
just weak thats all

  the silence of a sepulcher filled the
vault it was a long time before either
of them spoke finally the foreman
said it may be that we wont get out
under the taboo



of here-that the men cant reach us
even though they get up the courage to
try

  the break is safe enough the en-
gineer replied but theres the water
and im afraid the drills broke through
and tapped--

  dont worry about the water said
the other in tones far more kind than
douglas had heard him rise its my
fault-all this scare about the frac-
tion

  another silence followed during
which the engineer wondered what judd
could mean after a time the foreman
continued

  theres something i want to tell
you i guess id better say it while the
airs good its about the old workins
do you know that you guessed right the
other day there aint any such thing
-nothin only one short shaft an its
filled with rock and earth

  but the chart douglas broke in
jason found a working map of the
old claim

  i know he did-the little shrimp
judd returned but as im tellin you
it showed only the one straight shaft
the bookkeeper faked the rest of it--
marked in the drifts and levels-just
to fool the lady somehow he thought
it would give him a stand-in

  in the wonder of this revelation the
engineer forgot the peril the terror and
fear of the moment yet there were
other things to be explained and he
waited for judd to go on

  im tellin you this the foreman
continued his voice growing weaker
because i want to do the square thing
by you let me tell you that i admire
your pliick youre made of the real
stuff-and my scare wouldnt work
with you i knew that as soon as i
reached the shaft house and saw that
you were goin to go down alone it
looks like a sure case of passin over
and i want to make things straight with
you

  there was no bitterness no hate
nothing but plaintive kindness in oliver
judds tone it was all a put-up job
he confessed at any other time or

place i wouldnt be man enough to tell
you but down here with just the two
of us and a mountain lyin between us
an daylight its altogether different i
got up the scare over a year ago you
see im under obligations to a bunch
that is determined to keep me down
this was my only chance to get out
with them they promised that if id
manage things so as to get the taber
for a song-discourage the girl and
make her give it up-theyd call things
even and let me go let me say it
hurt me to take an advantage of a girl
shes every ounce a woman that little
girl and if i ever get out of here im
goin to get down on my knees and beg
her to forgive me thats what i will-
me old oliver judd who never begged
quarter from any one man or woman
whats more ill take off my hat to
the fellow that claims her for his own
he will be a lucky chap you bet

  martin douglas forgot that he had
ever harbored ill feeling against the
foreman he reached over and found
judds big hand the two gripped long
and hard in the black tense silence of
the vault in that firm handclasp there
came between them complete mutual
understanding

  theres just one more thing the
foreman added and then my con-
science is unburdened thats about the
robber last night i took the old map
from the bookkeeper knowing it was
bogus and not wantin you to make a
fool of yourself over it i had to tie
jason down the little brat as he tried
to fight i didnt spose it was in im

  silence again filled the vault after a
long while both men were conscious of
a change in their situation both were
so nearly exhausted that it was some
time before they fully realized its mean-
ing they finally awoke from a dazed
stupor to hear the dull thud of picks
and the murmur of voices far away
were the sounds but they brought an
assurance of rescue replaced doubt
with certainty and started the blood
to flow anew

  they waited patiently-hours it
seemed they dropped again into un-
consciousness and were as dead men

when those of the night crew who had
the courage to go down pulled them
out

 when they revived they were
stretched on the cool ground in the
sweet pure air of the outer world it
was broad day bright sunlight filled
the vale and touched the surrounding
fir-clad mountains with a glory fire
douglas awoke to the thunder of the

stamp mill and the sputtering cough of
the hoist engines as the loaded cages
were jerked up the shaft and as he
opened his eyes he found himself look-
ing into the smiling radiant face of
winnie mason his head was pillowed
on her arm and she was speaking softly
in his ear

  youre a brave man and i am proud
of you she said

time limit

hen farmer fairweight went to london on a flying visit to his grand-
  mother he made up his mind to see all the other sights as well and after
he had dutifully drunk tea with his ancestor he issued forth on a voyage of
discovery

    he discovered many things that busses could go without horses that
you could walk for a whole hour without striking a field or an acquaintance
and finally that you couldnt hit a policeman simply because he compelled you
to move out of other peoples way

     as he was being taken to the station he inquired what the policeman intended
doing with him

    youll find out soon enough said the policeman grimly seven days
probably

    seven days ah thats where i have ye old bluebottle chuckled the
farmer triumphantly producing the return half of his ticket ive to go back

               with the nut-brown tress of the beautiful maid
               who nestled upon his knee

soft as the down on an angels wing-

               he was rather good at this sort of thing-

here are you off to in such a hurry

    to fetch the doctor for my husband

    whats up with him

     he tells me he has got hepatitis dyspepsia rheumatism enteritis gastritis
appendicitis nephritis and cerebro-spinal meningitis

    where did he get all that

    why a man induced him to buy a medical dictionary and hes just begun
reading it
ll the boys in the i x l
shops were good fellows the
bo ss old heddies set the ex-
ample he had  worked his
way up from apprenticeship
in the shops to the office of general
manager and unlike a great many suc-
cessful men he did not forget the ranks
from which he rose

  one of his first unofficial acts was to
organize two baseball teams one com-
posed of men from the shops the other
from the office force formerly there
had been a distinct line drawn between
the mechanics and the pen-pushers but
old man heddles erased it he got
right out on the field himself and um-
pired the games imparting the spirit of
good-fellowship and fair play

  tom gunderson was the most popu-
lar fellow in the shops and he held him-
self a little above the office force be-
cause they had been a bit snobbish be-
fore heddles came and it was toms
way of getting evfen

  whenever a new clerk came to the
office toni gunderson scraped acquaint-
ance with him and held him up to ridi-
cule before all the shop men at noon
hour or at any time when the audi-
ence was large enough to pay him for
his trouble his pet aversion was
young college men who came straight
from the university with very little

knowledge of things mechanical and
got work in the office at higher salaries
than most of the men in the shops

  when manager heddles inaugurated
tennis games at the noon hour gun-
derson had a new chance to show up
the college men he had played tennis
for years ahd he won and held the
championship of the shops so each
new college man who came to the office
was challenged by tom and they usu-
ally went down to defeat which pleased
the mechanics and irritated the office
force

  during the spring of  all the em-
ployees of the i x l company fought
for possession of the four tennis courts
at noon hour tom gunderson was
still the champion but several promis-
ing stars had appeared on the horizon
of the office staff and rivalry was be-
coming keen

  you shop fellows have had the up-
per hand in tennis too long said man-
ager heddles one noon hour when
tom had defeated four of the office
corps theres a new man coming to
work monday he was the champion
athlete at cornell and i think hell give
you a good game of tennis tom

  swell chance for him said tom
wiping his hands on his overalls hell
come all fitted out with a ten-dollar
racket a jersey white ducks tennis

shoes and all those things and ill beat
him out just as i stand tom pointed
to his black work jacket and heavy
shoes it dont take outfits to win
games i can put it all over him in my
shop clothes

  all right said heddles ive
warned you tom

  before monday morning interest in
the arriving athlete had become intense
in the i x l factory

  ill bet hes one of those boobs with
a stand-up collar and a pink-and-white
face hell be easy meat for you tom-
my my boy said old bill taylor
toms bench mate theyll have a
hard time in the front office handing it
to the machinists

  worst of it is said tom gunder-
son those college fellows always think
they know everything about the shops
too most of them have taken mechani-
cal-engineering courses but all theyve
got is theory

  yes thats the trouble no experi-
ence like what weve got said old tay-
lor filing away laboriously at a pipe
fitting

  ill put my initials on that college
kid boasted tom gunderson

ii

jlonday morning a number of the
machinists were on hand early
loitering about the office door hoping
for a sight of the new office man before
the whistle blew

  but nobody saw him whenever one
of the machinists had occasion to con-
sult another that morning they both
talked about the new college man and
what tom would do to him noon
hour came in ten minutes time all the
shop force had finished their lunches
and were waiting at the tennis courts
for the new wonder to put in an ap-
pearance

  at last manager heddles came out of
his office with a slim well-dressed
pleasant-faced chap who walked along
briskly and shook hands with the shop
men as heddles called them up to be in-
troduced

  this is a little surprise said hed-

dles my son jim heddles is the
new man in the office hell be in the
shops in six months if he doesnt make
good in the office

  the college man laughed nervously at
his fathers introduction

  gunderson id like to see jim play
you a game of tennis if he isnt any
good at it id like to know how to get
back the few thousand dollars i spent
on him at cornell said the older man

  look here exclaimed young hed-
dles i learned more than playing ten-
nis at cornell dad

  well maybe you did go to it
boys

  the only preparation jim heddles
made was to throw off his coat and pick
up one of the tennis rackets belonging
to the office force he stepped out into
the court to oppose tom gunderson
and the men from the shops and the
office force on opposite sides held
their breath and watched and waited

  from the very first jim heddles put
it all over tom gunderson

  you see said old man heddles
slyly jim hasnt been doing anything
for the last four years but spend my
money and play tennis while toms
been working like a man

  the shop contingent began to look
very sad as their hero tom lost the
second game on a sizzling lawford
shot at him by young heddles evi-
dently the college man had better stuff
in him than the machinists had given
him credit for

  tom blew up in an effort to get
over as fast a ball as young heddles
he hit wild and once sent the ball fly-
ing over the gantry crane between the
two big factory buildings

  the office staff roared as the ball hit
the edge of a building and bounced
back onto the track of the electric
crane

  leave it there exclaimed manager
heddles heres another ball

  tom gunderson was mad his wrath
showed in his red face he hit vicious-
ly and did his very best to outpoint
jim but the college man came off
victorious
the tennis court decides



  a love set he cried at the finish
want to play another

  no said tom gunderson throw-
ing down his racket and fearing to raise
his eyes to his companions ive got
enough

  you dont think so badly of this
theoretical college man then smiled
manager heddles

  oh hes no good tom gunder-
son tried to raise a smile but he looked
contemptuously at the young fellow
who had beaten him get him to try
filing a couple of cubes against me ill
file em so close theyll stick together
let him try that

  oh i havent got the mechanical
end down as fine as you have laughed
young heddles ill admit youre my
superior at that but even if i am a
college man and even if my father does
think im incompetent ive done a lot
of work and had a little experience
he moved off toward the stairway lead-
ing to the gantry crane

  tom gunderson thoroughly angry
followed him well ill try out
against you at anything in the shop he
exclaimed fearing that he had lost his
prestige among the machinists

  well put that off till some other
day lets hunt up that tennis ball
now laughed jim heddles starting up
the stairway to the crane which ran like
a bridge between the two big factory
buildings

iii

tom followed heddles his jaw set

	with dogged determination ill
bet ive learned more right here in the
shops than youve ever learned out of
books he declared turning with a
wink to the fellows behind him who
were crowding up the stairway to see
the fun so far tom had made a point
in not being afraid of the boss son but
the elder heddles appreciated the sore-
ness of tom as much as anybody else
and excused him for it in view of the
fact that he had been the factory idol
for years

  young heddles paused at the top of
the stairway and shouted back still
smiling oh youve been cooped up

over a little bench all you know is
what goes on in the machinists room
ill bet you never even learned to run
this gantry crane

  no admitted tom reluctantly
standing beside the college man and
blushing in the sight of his companions
but ill bet you dont know any more
about it than i do

  sure i do i know that the power
is furnished by dynamos down in the
power plant there and that the cars
are run by power from a third rail

  i know that too said tom gun-
derson quickly inspecting the long steel
rail at which jim heddles had pointed
in explanation

  but you dont know how to walk a
third rail said jim heddles with a su-
perior grin looking down at the hun-
dred or more men from the shops and
offices watching them

  sure i do said tom not to be out-
done in anything

  well theres the ball in the middle
of the crane said jim heddles point-
ing to where the tennis ball lay near
the third rail walk out on this rail
and see if you can pick it up

  dont you do it tom cried one
of the men more familiar with the gan-
try crane and its operation than gun-
derson itll give you a shock

  i know how to walk the rail if you
do exclaimed tom gunderson hotly
you go ahead and ill follow i can
do anything you can do

  all right said jim heddles with a
confident smile i dont know how
many volts there are in that rail but
i learned how to walk a third rail at
college and thats more than you ever
learned in the shops

  go ahead then talk wont carry
you across the crane

  jim dont be a fool cried man-
ager heddles from below as his son
stepped toward the third rail and raised
his foot thatll jolt the daylights out
of you its charged

  i know it-jim smiled down to his
father- i just want to show this ma-
chinist that i know as much about the
factory as he does


top-notch magazine

  go ahead then shouted tom be-
side himself with rage

  for answer jim heddles waved his
hand and stepped lightly onto the third
rail running quickly along it jumping
off at the middle picking up the tennis
ball and turning to the awed crowd to
cry

  now come on gunderson thats
what i learned out of a book lets see
if you can walk the third rail as i did

  tom started forward three or four
of his friends grabbed him and tried
to pull him back but he was thorough-
ly angry and would suffer no restraint

  he put his foot on the third rail

  bang he shot three feet in the air
and fell flat on the platform a dozen
friends rushed to his assistance he sat
up weakly rubbing the back of his head
and crying who hit me who hit
me

  jim heddles stood in the middle of
the crane runway doubled up with
laughter and the senior heddles and
the crowd below stood in speechless dis-
may and wonder

  how the deuce did you do it cried
tom rising halfway and shaking his
fist frantically at jim heddles

  easiest thing in the world an-
swered the college man watch me

  he stepped lightly onto the third rail

and ran rapidly back until he reached
toms side then he jumped off and
held up one shoe for toms inspection
it was a rubber-soled tennis shoe
oh said tom weakly looking
down at his own hobnailed shop shoes
of which he had been so boastful only
a few days before i forgot i didnt
notice that you had them on i didnt
stop to think

  thats another thing i learned in
books remarked jim heddles trium-
phantly

  what is asked tom

  i learned to stop and think i no-
ticed that you had leather-soled shoes
on and i took a chance on your not
thinking that my tennis shoes had rub-
ber soles and formed a perfect insula-
tion against the current of electricity
well youve got me said tom
forcing a smile and rising to shake
hands with the boss son

  manager heddles pushed his way
through the crowd and grasped the
hands of both let this put an end to
all rivalry between you boys in the shop
and you in the office jim he said
turning to his son youve got a head
on your shoulders i wouldnt wonder
if youd be manager here some day in
spite of the fact that you are hampered
with a college education

                   change of symptoms
viow nora said the departing physician to the irish girl who was nursing a
bad case of fever if the patient sees snakes again give him a dose of
this medicine i shall be in at six

    the hour for his return arrived the physician once more visited the sick
patient and found him raving he has been so said the nurse for hours
and did you give him the medicine inquired the puzzled doctor

    nora shook her head

    but didnt i tell you to give it to him if he saw snakes again demanded
the physician

    but he didnt say he saw snakes this toime dochter replied the nurse
confidently he said he saw red-white-and-blue turkeys wid straw hats on

t happened so suddenly that
finnerty was still dazed one
moment the checkerboard
with its numbered squares and
double set of men the brood-
ing lamplight the quietly ticking tele-
graph instruments the low night noises
from the woods across the track then
the pistol muzzle and black-masked
face at the open window and the two
sharp words that sent his hands ceil-
ingward

   comprehension came as a stocky fig-
ure materialized scrambled in across
the instrument table and dropped to the
floor finnertys eyes flickered anx-
iously toward the safe in the corner

   youre on observed a crisp voice
back your chair to the wall drop
your right hand to the chair arm p

   five minutes later following a fruit-
less third degree regarding the com-
bination of the safe-known only to
the railway postal clerks-the lone oc-
cupant of the junction station found
himself bound as he sat while the un-
known on his knees before the safe
turned the knob and listened

   just prior to the advent of the ban-
dit the game of over-the-wire check-
 ers had been interrupted for the report-
ing of a freight up the branch the
ticking instrument ceased its chatter as

the man at the safe produced a brace
and bit and fell to drilling there was
an interval of silence and the sounder
clicked

  you there fin its your move

  finnerty turned toward the instru-
ments helplessly the question was re-
peated then the station call a flicker
of hope that followed the repetition of
the call quickly faded there would be
no train through for two hours and his
mere absence from the wire would
probably not result in any endeavor to
reach him before that time

  you there fin again clicked the
sounder whats the matter

  catching at the meager possibility of
his silence resulting in the discovery of
his predicament finnerty listened while
the operator at bathton repeated the
junction call at short intervals then
the spark of hope kindled as the instru-
ment began repeating the letter of the
dispatchers call

  the bathton operator was a rapid
sender at the buzzing succession of
dots forming the letter h the grind-
ing at the safe abruptly ceased turn-
ing finnerty encountered the gleam of
a suspicious eye within the sinister
mask

  whats coming off there de-
manded the unknown sharply


top-notch magazine

  one station calling another re-
sponded finnerty with frankness

  there was a momentary silence and
the rapid buzz-bell repetition of hs
broke out afresh

  the safebreaker dropped his brace
and bit and rose to his feet i didnt
see you move he said grimly but if i
thought you had been up to anything

there-

  he strode toward the table at once
the checkerboard caught his eye to
finnertys surprise the discovery
brought forth an exclamation then a
low laugh the man bending over the
board half turned

  now im  my friend i butted
in on a game of checkers by telegraph
and the other man thinks something is
wrong

  brilliant murmured finnerty
with rash tartness perhaps you would
like to finish the game yourself he
added when his captor had remained
over the board some seconds as though
pondering the problem there presented
thats just what i was thinking
finnerty started then he stared
while the man in the mask picked up the
checkerboard bore it carefully across
the room and placed it on the floor be-
side the safe a remark was lost in
further surprise when the man re-
turned to his side and began loosening
the cord about his right wrist

  yes im going to finish the game
myself-to keep that fool on the wire
quiet you are going to send the
moves very slowly figure by figure so
i can tell whether you say anything else
i know how the game is played by wire
between moves you are to hold your
hand high in the air and at the least
suspicion that you are saying anything
else-the fumbling at the knot ceased
and the eyes within the mask glared into
finnertys own-at the least suspicion
-you know whatll happen to you
understand 

  i guess so conceded finnerty

  no guessing-you know

  well then i know-and something
else finnerty added mentally with
determination the inspiration took

form as his hand was freed and or-
dered held aloft

  what explanation shall i make for
leaving the wrire so suddenly  he asked
ingenuously

  the eyes within the mask again
glared within an inch of his own
young man you begin a word of ex-
planation and youll finish it in the next
world no sir youll start right in
where you left off and the man at the
other end can think what he pleases
the cracksman returned to the safe
kneeling in his former position he re-
covered the drill then paused to study
the checkerboard during the silence
which followed the operator in the
chair fancied that there was a puzzled
expression on the mask-concealed face
the impression brought a new hope
perhaps the man could not play or
could play but a poor game in that
case with his own strange actions on
the wire suspicion might yet be
aroused

  whose move asked the mask
  mine

  huh youre no great noise as a
checker player youll lose out in the
third move

  another hope had fled

  surprise and a half-conscious anger
at the disparagement of his playing
ability were still struggling in fin-
nertys mind with plans for circumvent-
ing the safebreaker when the latter
looked up and ordered

  drop your hand to the key now
send slowly figure by figure twenty-
one twenty-three

  finnerty pushed open the key lever
interrupting a renewal of his own call
by the man at bathton and while the
cracksman listened intently ticked off
the figures as directed

  two-one two-three

  hand up again directed the mask
the silence which followed on the
part of the instrument seemed aptly to
express the bathton operators surprise
at this abrupt reappearance of his
checker opponent

  was that you fin he clicked at
last where have you been
in the king row



  finnerty took quick advantage of the
opening

  you see he said nodding toward
the sounder he doesnt believe it is i
he wants to know ill have to make
some sort of explanation

  youll just repeat the move
growled the safecracker let him
think what he pleases hell probably
imagine youre drunk he added sar-
donically

  with compressed lips finnerty com-
plied  and this time to his disappoint-
ment the bathton operator accepted the
situation with a tart o k immedi-
ately followed by a return move the
strange game was under way

ii

tuatched sharply by the bandit
finnerty sent and called off move
after move the man in the mask con-
tinuing his drilling operations uninter-
ruptedly save for the brief pauses re-
quired to make the moves and to listen
to the operators sending

  after the first few moves finnerty
scarcely noted the progress of the
game performing his part almost me-
chanically he was searching every crev-
ice of mind and memory for a means of
securing the upper hand of the situa-
tion think as he could there seemed
but one outlet-the wire and but the
one way of utilizing it-the sending of
something in addition to the moves of
the game

  at first sight this might seem a sim-
ple problem the bandit not being a te-
legrapher but the brevity o the
move messages-four figures-and
the deliberate transmission required
made the addition of the shortest useful
word practically an impossibility

  for a space finnerty considered the
substitution of two short words for a
move but this would have aroused
suspicion by muddling the positions on
the board for similar reasons he
abandoned a briefly entertained idea of
playing the game himself and sending
out a call for help in lieu of the sup-
posed moves he doubted his ability to

remember the positions of the dimly
seen checker men

  finally however dogged persistence
produced one possibility it did not
look easy but catching at it with des-
peration finnerty determined to risk it

  as the first step on transmitting the
next move in the game he did not raise
his hand to its full stretch three
moves later without comment from the
man at the safe he raised it no higher
than his head cautiously feeling with
his fingers he found as he had hoped
that he could reach the wall and the
two descending wires of the station
loop

  the next step was the securing of an
open pocketknife lying on the table

  occasionally convinced seemingly
that the prisoner had learned his les-
son the safebreaker did not turn from
his work when ordering a move
watching for a recurrence of this re-
laxation finnerty while withdrawing
his hand from the key made a furtive
lunge and secured the knife the ac-
tion passed unnoticed

  carefully then and praying that the
man at bathton would take his time for
the next move he pressed the blade
across the two wires behind his head
and cut firmly downward through the
insulation from the instruments came
a jangle as the steel reached and bared
the copper strands and a cut-off con-
nection was made

  the bandit looked up finnerty bit
his lips to steady them if the man or-
dered him to hold his hand higher and
saw the knife-

  wasnt that a move

  a bug on the wire said finnerty

  a breathless moment the mask eyed
him then the hum of the drill re-
sumed

iii

perator bates at bathton
was as mystified by the actions of
his checker opponent at the junction as
finnerty had suggested to his captor

  if it wasnt for the game he is play-
ing bates observed to the night bag
gageman lolling over the table beside
him id swear fin had some fire water


top-notch magazine

in his battery he never played a bet-
ter game

  there he exclaimed just listen
to that ham stuff driving his chair
back bates motioned disgustedly to-
ward the heavily clicking sounder if
father morse heard that hed turn in
his grave it sounds as though the beg-
gar were sitting on the key sending by
bumping up and down on it i cant

make head or-

  sharply bates broke off he sat
erect with a crash his chair rocked
forward his eyes fixed to the wagging
sounder

  what is it  demanded the bag-
gageman

  i believe somethings wrong i
caught the words post-office safe 
the signals began to come more dis-
tinctly listen cried bates

boring--hole-to-blow-it-open
both men were hanging over the in-
strument breathlessly the baggage-
mans eyes on the operator the opera-
torseyes glued to the sounder

  im-tied-chair he read on hes
-playing--the-checkers making--
me-send-moves im--sending-this
-by-pressing-wires-together - be-
hind-head-with-key-open ask-
h-send-down-engine-of - thirty-
four-with-help if-hurry-can-get
-him keep-on-playing

  the wire closed and in the former
manner of sending came a move in the
game three-o two-six

  the baggageman sprang for the door
ill get out the train crew he yelled
theyll be in the lunchroom

  and call for volunteers among the
passengers bates shouted after him

  to finnerty at the junction bates
shot back im on old boy keep it
up  keep your nerve  and whirled off
into the dispatchers call

  three minutes later bates was racing
down the station platform shouting the
engineers name a scrap of fluttering
flimsy in his hand five minutes
more and the engine of the opportune-
ly waiting accommodation was snort-
ing hysterically from the yards bris-
tling with trainmen and an eager con-
tingent of excursioning stockmen

  meanwhile returning to his wire
bates confronted a new situation two
additional moves brought abrupt conclu-
sion to the game of checkers in favor
of his safebreaking opponent and fin-
nerty reported

  he doesnt intend playing another
game he has the hole farther jnto
the safe door than i thought if hes
not delayed hell be ready to blow it in
a few minutes what shall i do  im
at the end of my string

  bates indulged in a clicking succes-
sion of exclamation marks expressivev
of confusion the while thinking deeply
his face brightened and he sent back
rapidly

  tell him i say he-that is you-
only won the game by a fluke say i
was talking to another chap here and
made two blind moves or he wouldnt
have had a look-in tell him ill beat
him-you of course ill beat him this
time without breaking my king row
i responded the instrument in ac-
quiescence

  during the momentous silence that
followed bates gripped the key rigid-
ly and watched the sounder straining
forward undoubtedly his robber op-
ponent was a checker enthusiast a
fan odd as it seemed but would
vanity and his love for the game be
strong enough to trick him in such a

situation would-

 the sounder clicked upward
h-i it rattled in the telegraphers
wire laugh and with a sigh and a
smile bates relaxed

  he bit the instrument clattered on
hell play says go ahead and hell
beat you so badly youll never come
back is fixing his board its your
move

  and now b the instrument clicked
more readily as finnerty mastered his
novel key its up to you to keep the
game going until the engine gets here
play all you know get him guessing
that stops him in his work for a few
minutes and it wont be safe simply
to delay the moves unless you follow
with a good one hes too wide awake
so play the game of your life

  i will tapped bates in reply set-
in the king row



tling himself in his chair he bent over
his board with serious face pondering
the opening move	

  suddenly bates sat erect by jove
thats it kicking the chair from un-
der him he sprang to the telephone

  police station please hellox ser-
geant baker  bates at the station
say baker can you come down here
right away and help me out in a game
of checkers its a matter of catching
a safecracker down at the junction
ill explain when you get here and
say drop in at the fire hall and bring
billy delaney with you good hur-
ry 

  within a few minutes operator bates
was explaining the extraordinary situa-
tion to the two local checker champions
so you see he concluded its up to
us by hook or crook to keep the game
going as long as possible without taking
the slightest chance of arousing the
mans suspicions

  can he play  asked the fireman
hes a crackajack-a regular check-
er fan i take it

  with dieads together over the num-
bered squares policeman fireman and
operator studied and debated the prob-
lem

  of course the most natural thing
to play for under the circumstances
would be a tie observed the sergeant
but then if he is a real player he
would see it as soon as it was in sight
and stop right there

  how would it do then suggested
the fireman to play for a two-king
three-king wind-up-ours the two
kings with one in either double cor-
ner that would give him the advan-
tage yet if the three of us watch our-
selves we should be able to stand him
off indefinitely ive spent half the
night working for the move in the same
fix

  thats the game agreed the others

iv

the junction matters had fallen
into routine with the resumption
of play stolidly to all appearances re-

signedly the bound operator sent and
called off the return moves steadily
and calmly as though engaged in an ac-
customed and enjoyable dual task the
masked figure at the safe moved the
men on the checkerboard and spun the
handle of his drill

  the opening half of the game at
least he had played steadily with the
evident intention of speedily concluding
it now with the contest narrowing
he was beginning to pause occasionally
to consider a move

  with rising hope finnerty saw the
pauses increase in frequency and at
last unconsciously the checker enthu-
siast rose above the robber of safes
and with rising anxiety saw the number
of men on the board steadily decreas-
ing

  chuckling the safecracker sacri-
ficed one checker man and took two
with despair finnerty noted that there
were now but five men on the board
three of them the blacks of the robber

  but on the next move coming over
the wire the man uttered a smothered
imprecation while finnerty leaned
forward tense with revived hope he
turned more fully toward the checker-
board the plaint of the spinning drill
subsided in pitch

  it had stopped as one beside a som-
nambulist finnerty watched and held
his breath and listened

  lower the cracksman sank on his
knees regarding the board he started
to move paused settled back now-the
drill was withdrawn and placed slowly
unconsciously on the floor the re-
lieved hand wandered to the drooping
chin

  at the moment faintly through the
open window came an engines cross-
ing whistle finnery caught his breath
with a gasp the sibilant hiss of which
drove the blood back to his heart the
masked figure at the safe moved raised
his head finnerty clutched the chair
arms in an agony of anxiety

  now i think i have him fourteen-
ten please came bates message

  unconsciously finnerty dashed the
perspiration from his brow before


top-notch magazine

reaching for the key then he found
he had forgotten the move he glanced
about

  i beg your pardon

  fourteen ten please

  a moments nervous inclination to
laughter as the subconscious mind
noted the exchange of courteous ad-
dress again delayed the transmitting of
the move

  it was sent finnerty recovering his
former position in the chair braced
himself for the final five minutes of the
ordeal would the engineer be unwise
enough to whistle another crossing
would he stop far enough away to
avoid the telltale hum of the rails reach-
ing the station  would he come close
enough to enable the posse to make the
depot speedily could bates prolong
the game

  in anxious repetition the questions
raced through finnertys mind as he
followed every move on the board and
listened with straining ears -

  a low rumble half heard half felt
reached him the engine was over the
bridge a half mile distant would the
engineer whistle the crossing this side 
no thank the heavens

  the game was now moving more rap-
idly on the cracksmans part evidently
he had a plan in mind and was shifting

his men in order to get the move
breathlessly finnerty watched

  following a move from bates the
player started half erect as with ela-
tion finnerty clutched the chair arm
a move was sent and one was received
with a low growl the bandit again
drooped over the board again fin-
nerty breathed

  then suddenly the player in the mask
sat erect with an ah that brought
finnerty forward in his chair

  now ive got him ten-six

  in despair finnerty glanced toward
the window his lips closed convul-
sively over a cry 

  with difficulty he clutched the key
and clicked off the move the return
move came five-one he trans-
lated

 ah my game my game in
his glee the checker-playing robber of
safes sprang erect on his knees-to sink
back slowly with twitching lips

  framed in the window were a dozen
grimly grinning faces in front of them
showed a battery of pistol muzzles

  yes your game observed fin-
nerty not without a touch of sympathy
for a fallen fellow enthusiast your
game on the board-but my game for
the safe i got in your king row there
all right

important chewing match

they have peculiar methods of trying suspects in bengal one of these is

	called trial by rice every person suspected was ordered to be present and
all turned up first the people were made to sit in a semicircle and were then
given raw rice and told to chew it to a pulp

    after about ten minutes they were ordered to stop and eject it into a plantain
leaf all did so easily with the exception of three men one of these three
promptly commenced to cry and confessed everything stating that another of the
three was the chief instigator

     it is a curious fact that fear arising from an evil conscience prevents saliva
coming to the mouth with the result described

the retort unmistakable

reverend gentleman do you know my friend that half the cases
of throat trouble are caused by people smoking those foul dirty short
black clay pipes

    son of toil and do you know guvnor that alf of the black eyes are
caused by folks not mindin their own business
chapter i

a call and a riddle

t four oclock that eventful
afternoon richard welling-
ton sat in the lounging room
oa san francisco club and
looked out at the passing
throng a page approached him

 telephone sir booth six the page
 said

 wellington got to his feet made his
 way slowly to the booth and took down
 the receiver	

 hello he called

dick

yes that you betty

 the voice that answered him was not
 the modulated contralto he loved to
 hear it was a voice that thrilled with
 fear or excitement or both

listen dick please drop every-
thing and come to me at the house as
quick as you can

anything the matter

yes please hurry

 pll be right up

wellington sprang from the booth
ran to the cloakroom for his hat and
dashed out of the club building he
hailed a taxi and jumped in calling out
an address to the driver

ia

  as fast as you can he said it is
important

  the taxi dashed through the streets
wellington felt his heart pounding at
his ribs he wondered what could have
happened it wasnt at all natural for
miss betty gladstone to be highly ex-
cited he had known her four years
he had been betrothed to her for a
month and in all that time he never
had known her voice to be charged with
fear as it surely had been when he
talked to her on the phone wire he
wondered if her father was ill he
hadnt seen betty for five days for he
had been out of the city n business
and had returned but an hour before
she telephoned he was at the point ef
calling her when she called him

  the cab stopped before the glad-
stone residence wellington paid the
driver and sprang up the broad steps
betty threw open the door she was
as beautiful as charming as ever wel-
lington told himself at the first glance
yet her face was pale and wore an ex-
pression of horror

  what is it betty he asked as the
door closed

  come into the library dick said
she he followed her in she closed
the door sit down she pointed to

chapter ii

betty has a pull

they had breakfast on the diner

	next morning just before arrival at
los angeles when they left the train
wellington was ordered to buy all the
morning papers he did so and car-
ried them back to betty who was in
the waiting room

  while i read the papers you rush
force inscrutable



out and engage the best automobile you
can find she directed

  where are we going

  i can answer that said betty with
an indulgent smile we are going to
san pedro

  he hurried away betty opened the
papers quickly and read the black head-
lines that told of a sea mystery off the
coast of southern california she read
every word of every article only one
paragraph seemed to change her man-
ner it was one telling of big bubbles
that had been seen near the flagship of
a cruiser fleet when that vessel was held
in the grip of some unknown force

  yes-yes betty breathed

  in a few minutes wellington was
back with a powerful car they got in
and the auto hurried through the
streets when they reached the out-
skirts of the city she turned to wel-
lington

  tell him to get there as soon as pos-
sible she directed

  on and on rushed the motor car
along oiled highways along dusty
roads past scores of pretty bungalows
to which betty gladstone paid not the
slightest attention she always looked
ahead watching for the end of the jour-
ney

  finally the car topped the small hill
and san pedro was before them the
inner and outer harbors were filled with
craft in the distance four cruisers
were at anchor signal flags fluttering
and wireless crashing the streets
were thronged the docks and shore
were crowded with people

  where now dick asked

  stop any place betty directed
pay the driver and let him return to
los angeles

  they stopped at a street corner and
got out wellington paid the chauf-
feur the machine rolled away and then
he turned to betty again

  now  he asked

  i must get on board the cruiser
alaskan  she said i must talk with
the admiral

  but you surely have read the news
betty you know of the peculiar oc-

currences down here nobody can
board any of the cruisers now

  it is because of those peculiar oc-
currences that i am here she replied
i must get aboard the alaskan

  the peculiar occurrences  welling-
ton gasped it is because of them that
you are here  what on earth-

  please dont ask me more now she
said let us go aboard

  but how

  betty turned and faced him you
are a man dick she said with a
mans genius for making up your mind
quickly and acting quickly with a mans
courage please try to forget that there
is any mystery that you do not know
what i am doing and go at things as if
it was something you were doing your-
self please take command dick and
when i ask you to do a thing find a
way to do it

  wellingtons face flushed thanks
for calling me to my senses betty he
said come

  he led her to a corner he saw a
merchant standing in the doorway of
his store looking out at the crowd and
hurried up to him

  is there a wiretess station here he
asked

  right back on the hill replied the
merchant

  thank you

  want to go up there the merchant
asked

  yes this young lady and i-

  my delivery boys just starting
you can ride with him

	thank you again wellington said

  the delivery boy drove up in front
from the alley at that moment betty
got into the seat with him wellington
conquered his dignity and sat at the
back of the wagon and let his feet hang
over

  the boy whipped up the horse and
they made their way down the narrow
dusty street

  funny business out there at sea
the boy observed

  anything new this morning betty
asked

  nope only the cruisers cant move
they say every captain is scared and


top-notch

magazine

wont take a ship out captain bob
millers the only one with any nerve
who is captain bob miller

  hes got a steel fishin launch and
he come over here from long beach
yesterday hes a hero he was drink-
in somethin awful yesterday and last
night but hes all right to-day i guess
he says hes goin back to long beach
this-afternoon but there wont any one
go with him you can bet

  they had reached the top of the hill
wellington gave the boy a half dollar
and helped betty to the ground and
they made their way to the wireless sta-
tion as the boy drove on to distribute
his groceries

  weve got some important messages
to send said wellington to the wire-
less operator when he and betty were
inside the station

  nothing doing the operator re-
plied smiling im sorry but the gov-
ernment has seized this station because
of whats happened the admiral is
sending out and receiving about as
many messages as i can handle i guess
hes some seared

  but the message is to go to the ad-
miral said betty sweetly

  i cant accept any messages for the
cruisers  i cant send out any except
those that come to me by wire from the
navy department at washington glad
to accommodate you if it was possible
but itd be as much as my jobs worth
and more i aint anxious to have the
government sore on me

  cant you just slip one message to
the admiral it has something to do
with this unusual occurrence said
betty

  im sorry-but i cant

  the government has the wire she
asked

  yes -

  and if the navy department ordered
you to send my message to the admiral

would-

  id do it in a moment

  i suppose i can send a message over
the telegraph wire cant i the gov-
ernment hasnt seized that

  sure you can send all you want

over the wire-but not over the wire-
less

  betty pulled off her gloves and seized
a telegraph blank she wrote a mes-
sage addressed to the secretary of the
navy washington d c it was in
code except the first four words and
those words were tell captain henry
gladstone-

  what is it wellington asked

  a message to my father in care of
the navy department it is my fathers
private code she replied

  the operator flashed the message
over the wire to los angeles and from
there it was hurried on to washington
there it was rushed to the secretary of
the navy who at that moment was in
consultation with captain henry glad-
stone fair bettys father

  the secretary and captain gladstone
had a hurried conference and there
was excitement in the manner of each
then the secretary wrote a reply and
dispatched it over the wires it flashed
to los angeles and from there to the
wireless station at san pedro the en-
tire operation had taken not more than
three-quarters of an hour for all lines
to washington were being kept open
for rapid service to southern california

  the operator at the wireless station
heard his call answered and took down
the message he looked at betty pe-
culiarly as he handed it to her

  guess youve got a strong pull he
remarked

  betty and wellington read the mes-
sage together

  harlan wireless operator san pedro
calif accept and send to cruiser alaskan
or any of fleet any messages miss betty
gladstone files give her every assistance
in your power

the secretary of the navy

chapter iii

new way to board a cruiser

w said betty ill write a wire-
less for you to send to the ad-
miral

  she sat down at the little table and
wellington handed her a dispatch blank
the telegraph sounder was ticking
again and the operator sat down to
force inscrutable



transcribe the dots and dashes it re-
corded he received two messages for
the admiral and immediately prepared
to send them on to the alaskan by wire-
less both messages were in the naval
code

 meanwhile betty wrote her aero-
gram 

  admiral b- on board u s s alas-
kan must come aboard at once to see you
on important matter betty gladstone

  when she turned toward the operator
with the message in her hand that gen-
tleman was sending the other messages
to the cruiser but in a moment he was
done and hurried toward her

  he took the yellow slip and soon
bettys dispatch was being hurled
through the air and being recorded by
the wireless operator aboard the flag-
ship

  then betty and wellington walked
to the door of the station and stood
looking down at the harbor waiting
they did not have to wait long within
five minutes the operator called to them
and when they entered he handed betty
a message it was from the old ad-
miral and read

  have received orders from washington to
see you and follow your instructions as
closely as possible fear you cannot come
aboard as launch owners will not make
trip i cannot send for you since cruisers
launch is in grip of the peculiar force and
will not move

  betty pouted then wrote another
message for the admiral it said

  will try to get aboard watch for me

  then she pulled wellington out of
the wireless station and hurried him
along the road that wound its way down
the hill

  what are you going to do betty
he asked

  go aboard the flagship of course

  but if we cant get any one to take

  we must find some one she said
  very well ill try

  first youll take me to a hotel then
youll get two bathing suits-one for
each of us

  bathing suits

  dont ask questions please hurry
and obey orders

  they walked rapidly into town and
to a hotel where wellington engaged
two rooms he was told he could ob-
tain bathing suits at the bathhouse near
by it was evident the hotel clerk
thought the pair of them insane

  wellington got the suits gave bettys
to her and threw his own in his room
then he hurried toward the water
front

  it happened that a certain captain
bob miller was on the dock telling
those assembled that he wasnt afraid
of anything that roamed the sea that
if he were the admiral hed take the
cruiser fleet wherever he pleased wel-
lington touched him on the shoulder

  id like to speak with you a mo-
ment he said

  captain bob followed him to one
side away from the crowd

  you have a launch wellington
asked

top-notch magazine

and myself to the cruiser youll do as
i said

  fll be ready and waitin captain
bob responded

  wellington hurried back to the hotel
he rapped on the door of bettys room
and betty opened it she was dressed
in the bathing suit wellington had pro-
cured and over it she wore a long light
cloak she had the collar turned up
and wore her hat and shoes

  get into your suit she said put
on your raincoat and hat dont let
the people know we have on bathing
suits if you can help it theyll im-
agine we are crazy

  but why are we wearing them he
asked

  no questions she said laughing

  wellington hurried to his own room
put on the suit put on his shoes and
hose and put on his hat and coat when
the coat was buttoned nobody could tell
how he was underdressed

  five minutes later he left the hotel
with betty and they made their way
rapidly to the dock captain bob was
there fussing about the engine of the
launch only two or three men were
near

  wellington led betty down the dock
and to the launch

  get in said captain bob im
ready

  they got in captain bob cast off
he started the engine and the launch
nancy turned her nose toward the outer
harbor captain bob increased the
launchs speed those on the docks and
on the shore observed the flying launch
and identified it

  on and on dashed the craft some
of the people on shore cheered cap-
tain bobs face flushed with pleasure
he turned and glanced at the man and
woman in the stern and wondered just
how high they stood in government cir-
cles

  they passed into the outer harbor
and started on the trip around the
breakwater hundreds of glasses were
watching the progress of the launch
now it had flashed through the crowd
that captain bob miller had nerve
enough to go out and try to reach long

beach and that a man and woman had
nerve enough to go with him bob
caught the infection and felt himself a
hero

  the launch turned and made straight
for the flagship on and on it went
wellington and betty could see blue-
jackets at the side could see an officer
here and there saw that preparations
had been made to receive them

  the launch came to within two hun-
dred feet of the cruiser

  told em th old nancy could do it
remarked captain bob with pride

  then the launch stopped quickly sud-
denly with such force as to hurl water
over the bows the craft whirled until
its nose pointed in the same direction
as the bow of the flagship and there
the launch nancy stuck riding on an
even keel not budging an inch though
her engine raced and her screw churned
the sea

  great salt water captain bob
cried he sat down in great disgust

  betty gladstone laughed took off her
hat removed her shoes then she stood
up and stripped off the long cloak she
stood there in the bathing suit laugh-
ing down at wellington

  get ready for a swim she told him
what are you doing to do  he de-
manded

  swim to the cruiser the launch
cant budge another inch

  betty we dont understand this
thing we dont know what danger
lurks beneath the surface if a great
ship can be made helpless by this un-
known power what will happen to a
swimmer 

  nothing will happen to a swimmer
-i know betty replied are you
afraid dick

  for you-not for myself betty

  i know you are not a coward this
is just an ordinary swim like hundreds
weve taken together except that the
crowds ashore are watching us and
were swimming to a cruiser instead of
a landing stage come on dick

  im afraid for you betty

  come dear-i know

  wellington groaned as he stripped off
force inscrutable



his shoes and hose and removed his
coat he stood beside her

  wed better not betty he im-
plored you dont know what you are
doing

  i know exactly what i am doing
she said come

  she sprang over the side went under
came up again and waved a hand at
him

  great salt water cried captain
bob this tilingll get her whatever
it is

  wellington took the plunge captain
bob his eyes bulging saw wellington
come to the surface and turn toward
him

  wait there for us my man he
called

  i guess ill wait all right shouted
captain bob

  there was fear in dick wellingtons
heart as he turned and struck out after
betty she was swimming easily as he
had seen her swim in bathhouse and
ocean hundreds of times wellington
swam strongly came up with her he
looked ahead at the cruiser now but
sixty feet or so away	

  i hope to heaven we reach it he
gasped

  theres no danger at all betty re-
plied

  wellington looked again two junior
officers were halfway down the star-
board ladder at the top an older offi-
cer was shouting orders at them

  betty aughed again quickened her
stroke grasped the base of the ladder
one of the officers aided her to mount
then turned to help wellington they
ascended to the deck there a grav-
haired old man who wore an admirals
uniform met them

  miss betty gladstone he asked x

  yes she replied pardon me ad-
miral for breaking all rules of naval
etiquette by calling upon you jn this un-
usual costume but it happened to be
necessary this is mr richard wel-
lington of san francisco my fiance
who came down with me from home
and now if you have a coat of some
sort i may put on-the wind is rather
chilly-well get down to business

  the old admiral made a noise that
sounded suspiciously like a snort of hu-
mor

  i am proud to have you come aboard
in any costume he said gallantly
glad to know you wellington kind-
ly come to my cabin botli of you if
you want dry clothes wellington one
of my young officers can fit you out
but im afraid miss gladstone will
have to dry out as she is and make the
best of it this is a ship of war and-
er-feminine apparel is something we
dont keep in stock

chapter iv

the threat

paptain henry gladstone
bettys father was known well
and favorably to half the officers of the
united states navy he had seen serv-
ice during the civil war with farragut
he had retired from active service soon
after peace was restored and had
moved to san francisco where he be-
came interested in a shipbuilding firm

  in time he prospered he built up a
fortune as he built ships he was an
authority on naval construction he
had devised many improvements on war
craft his firm had constructed several
gigantic cruisers and a large number of
torpedo-boat destroyers and subma-
rines

  but now captain gladstone had been
retired from business for almost ten
years yet he was still hale and hearty
and still retained the mental power that
had done much for his countrys navy
he was still a man of patriotism he
was called frequently to washington in
conference with the chiefs of the naval
department his word always carried
great weight

  so now when the old admiral faced
betty and wellington in his cabin his
first words were of bettys father

  i fought with him under farragut
he said i havent seen him in more
than two years now id like to see
him again i was astonished when i
received the intelligence from washing-
ton that you were in san pedro and


p-notch magazine

that i was to cooperate with you in any
way that i could i feared at once that
your father was ill-too ill to come to
san pedro-and had sent you in his
place with some information or some-
thing like that i take it that your fa-
ther has some idea regarding this pe-
culiar phenomenon

  father is in excellent health re-
plied betty he is in washington
now in conference with the secretary
of the navy about some matter i
started from san francisco before fa-
ther reached washington for he
couldnt have arrived there until this
morning

  i had hoped you were here to ex-
plain this unusual occurrence

  i am here to help dispel it said
betty but i fear i cannot explain
the admiral looked at her with a
puzzled expression on his face

  i understand what is happening
she said quickly but for certain rea-
sons i cannot tell you even mr wel-
lington does not know my father does
however since he is away i did not
dare wait until i could communicate
with him until he could get to the pa-
cific coast again i took matters in my
own hands you must trust me sir
and let me do things in my own way
what have you to suggest  the ad-
miral asked

  i have read the morning papers is
the story they tell true substantially
i believe so

  there is a-a something-that para-
lyzes ships holds them still in a certain
position 

  that is it

  and the big bubbles--

  one of my officers reported them
then what i feared is true in-
deed i knew it before i asked the ques-
tions for nothing else could- she

stopped confused

  well the admiral asked

  what has been done

  nothing said the admiral nothing
-except that the fool department has
ordered the remainder of the fleet here
-here where the danger threatens
pardon me for calling it a fool of a de-
partment but you are an officers

daughter and will not repeat my words
neither will mr wellington i am sure
the remainder of the pacific fleet is
coming then 

  ought to be here to-morrow said
the admiral

  all of it

  cruisers destroyers submarines
  submarines too 

  yes

  and when they arrive-

  theyll get tied up the same as the
alaskan i suppose said the admiral

  betty laughed and bent toward the
old sea dog

  admiral she said if you could
get out of this scrape any way you
pleased what way would please you
most 

  id find out what this peculiar
power or force or influence is and re-
move it he answered

  you cannot do that she said you
cannot find out what it is-must not in
fact-and you cannot remove it but
i know what it is-and i hope to re-
move it

you  a girl  i beg your pardon
it is all right sir it does sound pe-
culiar yet it is the truth would you
like to move the alaskan now just to
know that you can

  would i cried the admiral you
just show me how it can be done
the other cruisers can move cant
they 

  they can-for about three hundred
yards-then they are promptly collared
and sent rushing back where they were
anchored

  did you ever try to move two of
them at once in different directions
no

  try it said betsy i happen to
know that this peculiar power or force
can control but one ship at a time
what cried the admiral

  it is a fact set all your four cruis-
ers moving and youll find that only
one of them will be bothered at a time
pardon me but there are a couple of
launches near the alaskan tied up as ef-
fectually as my ship the admiral said

  because they are within a short ra-
dius of the alaskan said betty


force inscrutable



  the admiral opened his lips to reply
but an officer entered and handed him
two messages the first one read

  captain gladstone rushing to san pedro
on special train tell his daughter to do
nothing and risk nothing until he arrives
further instructions later

  then ill get to see your father
again said the admiral handing her
the message

  he unfolded the second one read it
gasped and read it again

  i get every wireless message you get
your fleet and captain gladstone can do
nothing tell miss betty gladstone and the
man with her to leave the alaskan tell her
to keep her tongue still and her hands off or
ill hurl every cruiser on the coast

  the admiral handed the message to
betty his hand was trembling

  what does that mean he asked

  betty turned pale put her hands to
her face for an instant

  i cant tell you-cant tell you she
said

  the admiral arose and towered above
her

  miss gladstone he said that mes-
sage informs us that the devilish power
or force that has been exerted here is
the work of a man-it is not some phe-
nomenon of nature you know that
mans name you know how he does
his devilish work do you not

  i-yes betty gasped

  then tell me in heavens name
does he work from the land or sea
and how can i outwit him how can i
undo his work  where theres a poison
theres an antidote

  i-i can tell you nothing betty
said

  miss gladstone

  your message from headquarters
she reminded him says for me to do
nothing to risk nothing

  the admiral sat down in his chair
again i beg your pardon he said
i had forgotten for the time being
that i had superiors and that they had
issued commands you think that your
father will solve the mystery-when he
arrives 

  i think hell do something betty
said

  but i dont want to stay here at an-
chor like a fool until he comes if i

can outwit this devilish force- you

said it controls only one ship at a time
didnt you 

  yes 

  that is the force can cover only a
certain radius 

  yes responded betty

  then ill have some fun said the
admiral ill send orders to the other
three cruisers and well see what hell
do he can get our wireless can he
well i know something he cant get
well see if he can read a string of sig-
nal hags and a wigwag

  the admiral went on deck and betty
and wellington followed him he
called a signal officer and soon a string
of flags ran up

  stand by to take orders it read

  then a sailor made his way to the
top of a turret and presently was wig-
wagging the admirals message to the
jefferson

  cruiser jefferson will weigh	anchor and

steam at half speed due west	if stopped

by force keep engines steady	prepared to
move if force stops

  the jeffersons o k was flashed
back and the wigwag man began his
message to the hamilton

  cruiser hamilton will weigh anchor and
steam at half speed toward san diego
anchor off alamitos bay if that point
reached without hindrance

  the admiral turned to betty and
wellington thatll send two of my
ships off in different directions he
said ill take the alaskan north if
the force releases her then well see
if all three cruisers can be controlled
and the fourth left here kept in posi-
tion at her anchorage by this man-made
phenomenon

  he laughed as he led the way back
across the deck before they reached
the side a junior officer approached
saluted handed the admiral a message
he read it his face turned white for an
instant

  he is a devil sure enough the ad-
miral exclaimed listen  he read
it to them


top-notch magazine

  i can read your signaling too if you
try to disperse squadron ill hurl the flag-
ship on the san pedro breakwater and turn
it into a mass of junk

  betty sprang forward and gripped the
admirals arm cancel your orders
she cried cancel your orders or hell
do it for he can--he can

  she was terrified there was horror in
her eyes in her voice the admiral
gave one long look at her and read in
her face that she spoke the truth he
ran shouting across the deck an in-
stant-and the wireless of the flagship
crashed out a message to the other
cruisers of the squadron

  disregard orders just issued remain at
anchorage

chapter v

a wave of terror

jdetty and wellington stood near
the rail waiting for the admiral to
return

  tell me betty wellington begged
ill help you keep the secret you
know the meaning of all this-and your
father knows id naturally think that
it had something to do with the govern-
ment with the navy since your father
has the knowledge-but the admiral
does not know and washington does
not know else the department people
there would wire instructions

  you dont understand-you cant
dream she said it is terrible-ter-
rible and i cant say a word now-so
please do not ask it dick

 the admiral came toward them
across the deck his face had a stern
expression  the old sea dog was about at
the limit of his patience

  and suddenly before he reached
them the cruiser alaskan sprang for-
ward like a wild thing snapping the
anchor cables causing a wave that al-
most swamped the cruisers launch and
the craft of captain bob miller

  startled cries came from the blue-
jackets from the officers the admiral
turned back toward the bridge betty
gladstone grasped wellington by one
arm and gave a shriek of fear

  on and on dashed the flagship

straight out to sea for a mile it shot
forward under the influence of the un-
known then the speed died down the
cruiser stopped rolled with the waves

  from the bridge the admiral signaled
the engine room the engines were
started the great ship turned and
steamed at half speed back toward the
anchorage near the breakwater

  wanted to show us he was still on
the job i guess the admiral mut-
tered

  he looked back at the anchorage
through his glass and gave an exclama-
tion the cruiser hamilton was in the
grip of the unknown now it was rush-
ing forward at full speed it stopped
it rushed backward it described a great
circle then was still

  next the jefferson then the adams
felt the grip of the unknown and one
by one the cruisers were released from
the force and allowed to creep back to
their anchorages fear in the hearts of
officers and men

  when captain bob miller found
after the alaskan ijad been carried
away that the nancy was no longer
held he put on full speed and dashed
toward san pedro harbor captain
bob had been hero enough for one day
and he needed liquid refreshment to
quiet his nerves but at the entrance
to the inner harbor the nancy was
stopped as if she had run against a
stone wall captain bob gave a squeal
of fear he felt the craft being rushed
through the water backward it
whirled it circled it was carried a mile
out to sea and there it was released
from that devilish something that had
controlled it captain bob put on all
speed and made for the harbor again
this time he reached it in safety and
took the nancy up to the wharf fie
made her fast and ran up to the nearest
street

  there was a government dredge in
the outer harbor it was torn from its
moorings rushed through the water
and left alongside the cruiser alaskan

  the water front was terrified again
the admiral of the cruiser squadron is-
sued orders for his ships to remain at
anchorage and not to attempt to move
force inscrutable



and for officers to be on their guard
to act quickly in case of emergency

  on the shore thousands watched
through glasses and with the naked
eye waiting to see if the ships were to
indulge in more antics but nothing
happened during the remainder of the
afternoon night fell the craft rode at
their anchors securely

  betty gladstone was given a cabin on
board the alaskan for in spite of the
looks of things the admiral refused to
allow a launch to attempt the trip to
shore wellington shared the cabin of
one of the junior officers but scarcely
any one slept

  every one was up at break of day
betty and wellington were served with
breakfast the admiral had sent word
that he would be in later he was in the
wireless room and when the admiral
did enter the cabin his face was white

  what is it betty gasped

  the fleet the admiral replied its
got the fleet-whatever the thing is it
caught em up the coast at about three
this morning it scattered em run em
in circles almost carried one battleship
on the rocks it pulled a destroyer
down-down on an even keel-until the
water was rushing in and filling her
then let her go the fleet is demoral-
ized but you were right miss glad-
stone-this thing can control but one
ship at a time the fleet has been try-
ing to keep together and one by one a
ship has been cut out of the line and
carried away to one-side to play circus
the last message came ten minutes ago
the fleet was one hundred miles up the
coast then so this thing that controls
the ships is there-a hundred miles
away and so-if you want to go
ashore-

  wait cried wellington we dont
know this force remember perhaps-
if we try to go ashore-itll be turned
on us

  betty sprang to her feet well go
ashore she said if the force is
wrorking one hundred miles away-if it
was less than a quarter of an hour ago
-well be safe in going ashore will
you get out a launch admiral it will
be safe

  cant you tell me anything before
you go the admiral asked

  orders from washington admiral
said for me to do nothing until my fa-
ther arrived and that other message
do you remember that admiral  it
said for mr wellington and me to go
ashore for me to keep my tongue still
and my hands tied or hed hurl every
cruiser on the coast

  the admiral ordered a launch per-
haps it is best he said quietly will
you keep in communication with me
please from the shore 

  yes betty said

  they followed the admiral to the
deck the launch was ready waiting
for them

  good-by for this time miss glad-
stone the admiral said

  he took her hand he dropped it
again instantly because an officer wa
rushing toward him with a message

  wait please maybe this is some-
thing the admiral said

  he unfolded the message read it it
was from the secretary of the navy

  now we are lost the admiral whis-
pered you must be brave miss glad-
stone

 what is it my father-

  the admiral handed wellington the
message and he read it aloud

  captain gladstone injured railroad wreck
in illinois at midnight not serious but
unable continue journey five or six days
tell his daughter to take matters into her
own hands

  betty gave a little cry and welling-
ton clasped her in his arms the mes-
sage says it isnt serious dear he said
softly be brave you are the daugh-
ter of a brave man

  gladstone laid up what can we
do now the admiral said

  betty straightened herself and
whirled toward him biting her lips in
an effort to keep back the tears

  do she cried ill take matters
in my own hands-as the message says
for all of it-this mystery this horror
and fear this dread of what may come
-all of it is my fault

  betty wellington cried aghast

  my fault she went on but ill


top-notch magazine

right it ill right it-and keep the
secret too

  poor girl the admiral said putting
an arm around her the shock has
been too much for her

  she tore away from him i know
what i am saying she said and ill
be my fathers daughter ill think of
duty before anything else-before my
father who is hurt-before you dick
dear

 what can we do what can we
do the admiral was saying

  do she cried get into com-
munication with the remainder of the
fleet tell them to make their way here
as well as they can with the interrup-
tions they are having but one ship can
be controlled at a time get them here-
anchor them in lines-in a circle-any
way you please then watch for the
bubbles-the big bubbles get your
torpedo tubes ready get your heavy
guns ready clear every ship for
action watch and when you see a
bubble-fire do you understand
shoot around the bubbles

chapter vi

to do her duty

it was noon when the remainder of the
 fleet arrived there was a squadron
of battleships eight more cruisers eight
destroyers five submarines

  messages flashed from the alaskan
to the other ships and they took up the
positions assigned to them as rapidly
as possible the admiral had placed
them to the best advantage so that in
case of the peculiar engagement betty
gladstone had advised there would be
the greatest freedom for action

  but the peculiar force that had de-
moralized the shipping of the southern
californian coast was not idle here
and there a battleship or cruiser or de-
stroyer would be jerked from its posi-
tion carried out to sea whirled in a
circle and released as yet none of
the little submarines had been touched
they hovered around their mother ship
like frightened chicks about an old hen

 betty and wellington had gone
ashore dressed at the great hotel and

made their way up to the wireless sta-
tion on the hill behind san pedro the
look of terror had not left bettys face
since she heard the message telling of
her fathers injury and placing every-
thing in her hands wellington knew
that she wras laboring under great emo-
tion was fighting continually to keep
back the tears

  time and time again he begged for
her confidence begged to share the se-
cret but she always refused always
said that it was her fault entirely al-
ways declared that her duty would come
before everything-before her father
before the man she had promised to
marry

  and so they remained at the wireless
station and through their glasses
watched the fleet

  from half past twelve oclock until
half past one there was no excitement
it seemed that the peculiar force or
power that had been at work had ceased
for the time being a launch from one
of the battleships made her way
through the water to the flagship
alaskan and returned without hin-
drance

  the old admiral had been busy issu-
ing orders and every commander knew
the part he was expected to play the
grim fighting ships had been cleared for
action at intervals along the rails of
every one of them sharp-eyed petty offi-
cers scanned the surface of the sea

  and then about two oclock from a
point near one of the battleships a big
bubble arose to the surface the for-
ward turret of the big battleship next
in line revolved the muzzle of the four-
teen-inch gun wtas lowered rapidly
there wtas a burst of flame a cloud of
smoke a roar that seemed to strike
against the hills back of the town with
force enough to demolish them

  near where the bubble had been seen
a column of water shot up into the air
for a great distance and fell back to
the surface of the sea with a crash

  the fleet waited hundred of glasses
were trained on the spot nothing was
seen five minutes later two big bub-
bles came to the surface near the line
of destroyers small guns rattled an-
force inscrutable



other fourteen-inch monster spoke and
hurled half a ton of deadly explosive
into the water one of the submarines
threw a torpedo-a torpedo which for
some unaccountable reason stopped
suddenly rose to the surface of the
water and rested there

  another destroyer gave a shriek
from her siren she had been jerked
out of the line was being rushed
through the water at a rapid rate one
hundred feet before her was a continual
line of big bubbles and into this line as
she rushed her one-pounders poured
their deadly hail but with no effect that
could be ascertained

  on and on went the destroyer final-
ly she described a circle and turned and
rushed back toward the fleet one hun-
dred feet ahead of her prow the line
of big bubbles was always to be seen
down the line she went between the
rows of cruisers and battleships the
guns of the fleet began raining shot and
shell at the bubbles a heavy pall of
smoke hung over the water fourteen-
inch guns boomed one-pounders rat-
tled secondary batteries added to the
din

  but the line of bubbles continued the
destroyer in the grip of the unknown
dashed on she turned again her bow
was pointed straight toward the break-
water her speed was terrific the
thousands of persons ashore held their
breath officers and men of the fleet
watched horror in their faces the
helpless members of uncle sams navy
aboard the destroyer could only stand
with folded arms and wait

  another hail of shot and shell struck
the line of bubbles on and on dashed
the destroyer she was traveling
through the water at a greater speed
than her engines ever had driven her
even on her trial trip

  two hundred yards from the break-
water and she still maintained her great
speed then the line of bubbles turned
to starboard quickly-turned away
from the destroyer but the little de-
stroyer dashed on unable to check her
great momentum her engines unable to
overcome the force of her traveling in
so short a distance

  there was a crash the sound of rend-
ing steel a chorus of shrieks and
screams and cries like a bit of drift-
wood the destroyer was hurled upon
the breakwater with such force that the
rocks tore a great hole in her bow

  men scrambled and tumbled over that
crushed bow sprang into the water
swam and waded ashore and turned to
look with horror upon the destruction
of their vessel it was not horror at
the fact that the craft had been de-
stroyed but at the manner of the de-
struction

  there were no lives lost the remains
of the destroyer were wedged on the
breakwater and would not sink the
craft could be saved if removed and
towed to a port before a storm broke
her up her commander was left alone
on the ship with an ensign and the
wireless operator the commanders
nerve was shaken but he was a com-
mander for all that he dictated a mes-
sage the admiral received it a few
minutes later

   regret to report destroyer milton hurled
on san pedro breakwater by force unknown
bow crushed no lives lost none injured
must have assistance to save ship

  the admiral did not need that re-
port  he had watched the whole thing
but in that moment of horror the com-
mander of the destroyer had not for-
gotten discipline had not forgotten the
rules of the service the admiral was
thinking of one thing-that shot and
shell had been poured at and around
the big bubbles and that the work of
the peculiar force had not been stopped

  and then he was handed another
message this time from the unknown

  shells nor torpedoes can harm me and
i can crush the flagship as easily as i crushed
the destroyer

  betty and wellington up by the
wireless station on the hill had watched
the peculiar battle the death of the de-
stroyer betty had dropped her marine
glass and turned away her hands over
her face

  it is terrible-terrible she moaned

  there dear you cannot help it
wellington said

  but it is all my fault-my fault


top-notch magazine

  nonsense dear it couldnt be
wont you tell me what you mean by
that wont you explain everything
to me trust me  there may be a way
i can help you i might be able to sug-
gest something

  no--no dick  i dare not she said
  cant you trust me betty

  yes-but it isnt that what i know
must remain a secret you dont un-
derstand dick dear it must remain a
secret-from every one 

  miss gladstone called the wireless
operator from inside the station

  betty and wellington hurried inside
the operator gave betty a message he
had just received she opened it and
read she reeled and would have fallen
if wellington had not caught her in his
arms

  what is it dear he asked your

father-

  not father she answered then
she stood up straight and strong she
looked the wireless operator straight in
the eyes you understand she told
him that washington has put this en-
tire matter in my hands since my fa-
thers injury this station has been
seized by the government you know
the penalty for disclosing any message 
very well destroy all records of this
one except that which you must keep on
file and tell nobody what this message
says do you understand  do not tell
a soul

  the operator looked at her then at
wellington and back at betty again

  i understand miss gladstone he
replied

  she looked him straight in the eye
again then faced wellington

  dick she said i am going down
into the town i want you to remain
here and get any messages that may
come for me regarding fathers condi-
tion the operator is to give you none
except those

  id better go with you betty he
said when they were outside

  no please i must go alone if
you love me you will remain here and
do as i say i have a duty to perform
dick and duty must come before any-
thing

  she choked back a sob and started
away from him

  betty- he callgd after her

  please dick remain there

  but where are you going what
are you going to do 

  i am going to do my duty dick
she said

talks with top-notch readers

 by burt l standish

on the

t is pleasant to know that so
many of our readers do not
rest content with enjoying the
magazine themselves but are
eager that others may enjoy it
so they pass the good thing along el-
mer e hienton of  citizens build-
ing cleveland ohio is one of these
he writes

  i am not in the habit of criticizing
but i think your magazine is not being
read enough in cleveland it is about
time you were giving the sellers a
shake-up and demanding that top-
notch be placed in the front win-
dow

  about three months ago and only
through an accident a copy of your
magazine got into my hands i am just
beginning to realize what a lot of good
reading i have missed the trouble
was that i never received the initial
copy

  when your sheridan of the u s
mail came out some time ago i pre-
sented the postman with a copy contain-
ing it and after reading it he became
so enthusiastic that he has advertised it
to all his fellow workmen at the down-
town office most of these he informs
me had never read a copy of top-
notch probably their trouble was the
same as mine-namely that the maga-
zine had never been brought to their
attention this is the only criticism i
have to make as to the magazine it-
self i do not think you could improve
on it and still keep the good will of all
its readers if this letter is worthy of
the space i would like to see it pub-

horizon

lished it will help me in my work of
getting subscribers for your magazine

jprom a railroad man in galveston
texas-h l brown-we have
the following

  top-notch as a rule is a mighty
good magazine but i wish to criticize
the fade-away car by f i ander-
son in the januaiy number in the
first place an engineer doesnt get his
orders from the towerman there are
three copies made of each order made
the operator keeps one copy the con-
ductor keeps one copy and the engineer
gets the third copy it is hardly prob-
able that a presidents special would
follow a freight train when both were
ready to leave a mogul is not a heavy
engine being only a --- that is two
small wheels under the pilot six drivers
and no trailers they are generally used
on roads that hardly ever have over a
seventy-pound rail and i know they
dont require a one-hundred-and-ten-
pound rail

  fancy double drops are sometimes
made and it is possible to switch a car
on a siding without stopping the train
when trains are run late they keep their
original time-card numbers superior
trains paying them no attention and
inferior trains keeping oft their time
if hansen had been working for the
railroad long enough to draw a pension
he would probably be running a pas-
senger train instead of a freight en-
gineers dont give up their engines at
the tower they are responsible for them
until they have been placed on the


top-notch magazine

roundhouse track the president of
the railroad himself cannot discharge
an employee who belongs to an order-
and gibbons belonged to the a b l e
-without an investigation and it is
the charges brought against him

  i like stories about things that could
really happen mr bertram lebhar is
my favorite and i suggest that he di-
vide his stories up in larger bundles in-
stead of giving him only twelve pages-
as in the issue of january first-give
him about twenty-five or thirty pages

  the above letter is another example
of the need top-notch writers have
for accuracy in matters of technical de-
tail while some of the points to which
this correspondent calls attention would
not seem important to the general read-
er they are of moment to the railroad
man who is familiar with the technical
details of operation

  it is the reader who has special
knowledge as well as the less critically
disposed one that an author will con-
sider-indeed must consider-if he
would turn out fiction suitable for our
practical times the author may say
in his defense of this particular railroad
story that it was accurate in such de-
tails as were essential to the tale but
our critic i am afraid will not accept
this as a sound defense although two
other railroad men writing of the
fade-away car have called it a cork-
ing good story

gdward spiegel of fort
wayne indiana writes about a
matter that has called forth other in-
quiries and we will answer all of them
at one time

  there has been a discussion in our
family about those pearl-covered bud-
dhas referred to in mr phillips
story the burlington buddha i
have read about it in another magazine
and so i argued in the affirmative

  i am an ardent lover of your lefty
stories and lebhars camera chap
stories i am not a knocker of t-n
because i have not found any fault with
the stories if you were to cut out
your short stories you would lose many
readers mr phillips when facts are
liars and the burlington buddha
are a good pair of stories and both have
splendid mysteries

edward spiegel

  if mr spiegel will look on page four
of the burlington buddha he will
find a description of the method used
in forming the artificial pearl this
process for promoting the building
of a pearl was applied in the thirteenth
century by ye-jin-yang a native of
hoochaw he seems to have been the
first to learn that pearls are caused by
irritants lodging in the oyster the
oyster builds a coat about the irritant
and this coat or covering is the pearl

  all manner of matrices are now in-
serted into the oysters depending upon
what shape of finished pearl is desired
naturally the buddha is favored high-
ly by the devout chinese the best
specimens of pearl-coated buddhas are
to be found in the british museum

  this artificial propagation forms the
staple industry of several villages in
china centering around soo chow
over five thousand persons being em-
ployed in it

  there has been no attempt to create
pearls in this country probably because
we do not have the time or patience of
the chinese often a matrix is allowed
to remain with its mother for six
years before a perfect coating is ob-
tained

jhrom walter h raynor secretary
of the northwestern research
club of detroit michigan we have
this
talks with top-notch readers

  i have been a reader of your maga-
zine ever since it was first published i
certainly believe it to be the best maga-
zine of its kind on the market and that
the proportion of serials complete and
short stories are just about right to
suit the average reader

  my favorite authors are yourself
terhune and lebhar and i enjoy the
stories of the others more than those
usually found in most other magazines
wish you could arrange to have a story
taking place in detroit and have it
woven around our automobile industry

  these actnal-place stories that are so
popular with you do not fall on the
top-notch editors desk along with the
autumn leaves that occasionally blow
in at the window we have to commis-
sion authors to write them it happens
that the mail brings one in now and
then but not one that we have been
able to publish because not up to the
mark

  we are always glad to receive a story
laid in any fair-sized town of the
united states or canada provided the
story is built in the way that our read-
ers like if this strikes the eye of any
author who knows his business and he
is moved to try his hand he will not
write to ask what particular style of
story architecture is needed to suit top-
notch readers instead of doing such
a useless thing he will take up a copy
of the magazine read it carefully and
learn just what sort of fiction we are

publishing he will study the methods
of the authors who are established fa-
vorites with our readers and he will not
ask any foolish questions of the editor
as to what is wanted he will teach
himself and thus pursue the only course
that can lead him to the fount of knowl-
edge thus it will be with the author
who knows his business

  after studying top-notcii he will
see that first of all he must have a
story to tell he will not begin to write
until he has a story after assuring
himself that he has a story he will pro-
ceed to take account of the town that it
is to be in and arrange his scenes so
that they will take in the local color of
the city calling places by their real
names and he will draw freely upon
the real life of the town whether it be
new-orleans los angeles montreal
pascoag rhode island or ducktown
tennessee

  another care the author who knows
his business will take is to have a plot
that gets stronger and stronger as the
tale unfolds and he will dress it all
in becoming verbal clothes from such
a writer we should be glad to receive
and pay for an actual-place story about
detroit or any other town-north
south east or west-of not less than
twenty-five thousand inhabitants this
is an invitation to fiction writers who
have attained proficiency in their art
