many times in the old days
while i trudged home after
work to save carfare i used
to gase enviously at the shin-
ing cars gliding by me the
prosperous men and women
within little did i think that
inside of a year i too
should have my own car a
decent bank account the
good things of life that make
it worth living

i thought success was forothers

      believe it or not just twelve months ago
      i was next thing to down-and-out

today im sole owner of the fastest
growing radio store in town and im
on good terms with my banker too-not
like the old das only a year ago when
often  didnt havafcone dollar to knock
against another in my pocket my wife
and i live in the snuggest little home you
ever saw right in one of the best neighbor-
hoods and to think that a year ago i used
to dodge the landlady when she came to
collect the rent for the little bedroom i
called home jt

  it all seems like a dream now as i look
back over the past twelve short months and
think how discouraged i was then at the
end of a blind alliy i thought i never
had had a good chance in my life and i
thought i never would have one but it
was waking up that i needed and heres
the story of how i got it

i was a clerk working at the usual mis-
erable salary such jobs pay somehow
id never found any way to get into a line
where i could make good money

  other fellows seemed to find opportuni-
ties but-much as i wanted the good
tilings that go with success and a decent
income-all the really well-paid vacancies
i ever heard of seemed to be out of my line
-to call for some kind of knowledge i
didnt have

  and i wanted to get married a fine sit-
uation wasnt it mary would have
agreed to try it-but it wouldnt have been
fair to her

  mary had told me you cant get ahead
where you are whv dont you get into
another line of work somewhere that you
can advance

  thats fine mary i replied but what
line ive always got my eyes open for a
better job but i never seem to hear of a
really good job that i can handle mary
didnt seem to be satisfied with the answer
but i didnt know what else to tell her

  it was on the way home that night that i
stopped off in the neighborhood drug store
where  overheard a scrap of conversation
about myself a few burning words that
were the cause of the turning point in my
life

  with a hot flush of shame i turned and
left the store and walked rapidly home so
that vvas what my neighbors-the people
who knew me best-really thought of me

  bargain counter sheik-look how that
suit fits one fellow had said in a low
voice bet he hasnt got a dollar in those
pockets oh its just useless ander-
son said another hes got a wish-bone
where his back-bone ought to be

  as i thought over the words in deep hu-
miliation a sudden thought made me catch
my breath why had mary been so dissat-
isfied with my answer that i hadnt had a
chance did mary secretly think that too
and after all wasnt it true that i had a
wish-bone where my back-bone ought to
be wasnt that why i never had a
chance to get ahead it was true only
too true-and it had taken this cruel blow
to my self-esteem to make me see it

  with a new determination i thumbed the
pages of a magazine on the table searching
for an advertisement that id seen many
times but passed up without thinking an
advertisement telling of big opportunities
for trained men to succeed in the great new
radio field with the advertisement was a
coupon offering a big free book full of in-
formation i sent the coupon in and in a
few days received a handsome -page
book printed in two colors telling all about
the opportunities in the radio field and how
a man can prepare quickly and easily at
home to take advantage of these opportuni-
ties i read the book carefully and when i
finished it i made my decision

whats happened in the twelve months
since that day as ive already told
you seems almost like a dream to me now
for ten of those twelve months ive had a
radio business of my own at first of
course i started it as a little proposition on
the side under the guidance of the national
radio institute the outfit that gave me my
radio training it wasnt long before i
was getting so much to do in the radio line
that i quit my measly little clerical job and
devoted my full time to my radio business

  since that time ive gone right on up al-
ways under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute
they would have given me just as much
help too if i had wanted to follow some
other line of radio besides building my
own retail business-such as broadcasting
manufacturing experimenting sea operat-

ing or rnny one of the score of lines they
preparelyou for and to think that until
that da i sent for their eye-opening book
id been wailing i never had a chance

now im making real money i drive a
good-looking car of my own mary
and i dont own the house in full yet but
ive made a substantial down payment and
im not straining myself any to meet the
installments

  heres a real tip you may not be as
bad off as i was but think it over-are
you saojied are you making enough
money it work that you like would you
sign a contract to stay where you are now
for the next ten years making the same
money if not youd better be doing some-
thing about it instead of drifting

  this new radio game is a live-wire field
of golden rewards the work in any of
the  different lines of radio is fascinat-
ing absorbing well paid the national
radio institute-oldest and largest radio
home-study school in the world-will train
you inexpensively in your own home to
know radio from a to z and to increase
your earnings in the radio field

plans are no matter how much or how lit-
tle you know about radio-clip the coupon

filled with interesting facts figures and
photos and the information it will give

strange facts

by hugo gernsback

be entirely absurd impossible and just pure fiction never-
theless in the current jssup of science and invention there
is described the apparatujjnvented by l theremin a young
russian who uses radioprinciples for his enthralling new
kind of music

in front of him stands a box containing certain radio in-
struments from the top of the box issues a rod while at
the left hand of the box is a brass ring just by waving his
hands in the vicinity of the rod and ring mr theremin
produces the purest as well as the most beautiful kind of
music that has ever been produced the effect of the body
capacity of the human being is responsible for the music and
anyone can learn to play the instrument in short order
providing he knows music tjnstrument gives forth flute-
like or violin sounds of the st exquisite beauty

a similar instrument by the way was used about two
years ago in my so-called pianorad an instrument using
 radio vacuum tubes which i operate by means of an
ordinary piano keyboard while the music issues from the
loud speaker the same as does the music of theremin both
instruments are based upon the same principle except where
i use an actual keyboard theremin uses his hands which
now act as an electric condenser otlierwise the principle
of the two apparatuses is the same

then again if one of our scientifictiuii authors had glibly
told us the havoc and destructiou that could be wrought by
sound waves that could not be heard by the human ear we
would probably have promptly heard from amateur scientists
and others yet at a demonstration before the national
academy of sciences by professor r w wood of johns-
hopkins university this scientist produced the most astound-
ing results with super sound waves totally inaudible to the
human ear these sound waves for instance when acting
upon cracked ice shook the ice to pieces in short order
and snow resulted a fish in a glass bowl when subjected
to these silent sound waves is killed within several minutes
an ordinary candle suspended in water and influenced
through the super sound waves is shaken into powder and
the water becomes a white milky fluid

stranger yet if two metal plates separated by a quartz
disc and connected to the super sound wave instruments are
placed in a beaker the latter filled with oil there is created
a sort of mound while the oil will form a little mountain and
stay that way as long as the super sound waves are turned
on not only that but the top of the liquid oil mound will
readily support a weight of  ounces at its crest all these
are facts much stranger than fiction and most of them have
never even been used or imagined by the average scientific-
tion writer if he had imagined them and written his imagin-
ings he would probably have been quickly derided or worse

               is a part and parcel of the makeup of the
average human to be most irritated by some-
thing that is unknown to him if we traced this
feeling to its lair we would perhaps have need
of a psychologist for the ultimate explanation
it will usually be found that the more sensitive
the person in question the greater the irritation this type of
person is usually easily offended because it seems an insult
to his mentality that a certain fact exists anywhere in the
universe of which he has no knowledge often also the
more highly learned a person is the greater the irritation
thus when a scientist comes along with something totally
unorthodox-some new fact which may not be discernible as
fact immediately-his fellow scientists are usually the ones
who become most irritated and loud in their denunciations
thus it was with galileo when-he attempted to prove that
the earth did not stand still but spun around on its axis-
a monstrous piece of nonsense in those days it not only
went against the grain and all inborn instinct but against
the church as well

  it was and still is true in the case of einstein arl his
theory of relativity most of these theories have been
proven after many years of wrangling among scientists and
mathematicians yet even today most of them are confirmed
doubters

  this is true also of a certain class of amazixg stories
scientifiction readers a class by the way which we are
happy to state seems to be in the minority this class is
always ready to tear and claw at any author who comes
along with a new idea which for the time being may be
contrary to facl although it may still lie within the realm
of science usually when such a scientifiction story is pub-
lished the howl raised by this class of readers is long
and lusty and most vitriolic they give no quarter and
are loud in their denunciations and go to great lengths in
venting their opinions as to why such and such statement
could never come true yet before the ink is dry it has
happened that a scientifiction prediction has become a fact
undaunted however the doubting thomases are inclined to
close their eyes and minds against every fact and glibly say
we dont believe it anyhow the old story of there aint
no such animal

  as has often been said fact is stranger than fiction if
for instance we had published a scientifiction tale whereby
a musician just by waving his hands in the air without any
physical contacts of any kind could produce the most
beautiful music imaginable i know right well that we would
have been inundated with protests that such a thing is a
physical impossibility indeed every scientist could have
given you dozens of good reasons why such a thing would

mysterious sounds

        ang bang

             the pistol shots were almost simul-
           taneous a cow peacefully grazing fifty
           yards away received one of the bullets
           in her back she had nothing to do with
           all the same

           of the adversaries was hit

  who were these two gentlemen  we do not know
although this would be an excellent opportunity to
hand down their names to posterity all we can say
is that the elder was an englishman and the younger
an american and both of them were old enough to
know better

  so far as recording in what locality the inoffensive
ruminant had just tasted her last tuft of herbage
nothing could be easier it was on the left bank of
niagara not far from the
suspension bridge which
joins the american to the
canadian bank three miles
from the falls

  the englishman stepped
up to the american

  i contend nevertheless
that it was rule brit-
annia  

 and i say it was
yankee doodle re-
plied the young american

  the dispute was about
to begin again when one
of the seconds-doubtless
in the interests of the milk
trade-interposed

  suppose we say it was
rule doodle and yankee
brtannia and adjourn to
breakfast 

  this compromise be-
tween the national airs of
great britain and the
united states was adopted
to the general satisfaction

the americans and eng-
lishmen walked up the
bank of the niagara on
their way to goat island
the neutral ground be-
tween the falls let us
leave them in the presence
of the boiled eggs and tra-
ditional ham and floods
enough of tea to make
the cataract jealous and
trouble ourselves no more
about them it is ex-
tremely unlikely that we
shall again meet with them
in this story

  which was right the englishman or the ameri-
can  it is not easy to say anyhow the duel shows
how great was the excitement not only in the new
but also in the old world with regard to an inex-
plicable phenomenon which for a month or more had
driven everybody to distraction



  never had the sky been so much looked at since
the appearance of man on the terrestrial globe the
night before an aerial trumpet had blared its brazen
notes through space immediately over that part of
canada between lake ontario and lake erie some
people had heard those notes as yankee doodle
others had heard them as rule britannia and
hence the quarrel between the anglo-saxons which
ended with the breakfast on goat island perhaps
it was neither one nor the other of these patriotic
tunes but what was undoubted by all was that these
extraordinary sounds had seemed to descend from
the sky to the earth

  what could it have been  was it some exuberant
aeronaut rejoicing on that sonorous instrument of
which some musicians make such obstreperous use 

  no there was no balloon and there were no
aeronauts some strange phenomenon had occurred
in the higher zones of the atmosphere a phenomenon
of which neither the nature nor the cause could be

explained to-day it ap-
peared over america
forty-eight hours after-
wards it was over europe
a week later it was in asia
over the celestial empire

  hence in every country
of the world - empire
kingdom or republic -
there was anxiety which it
was important to allay if
you hear in your house
strange and inexplicable
noises do you not at once
endeavor to discover the
vuise  and if your search
-j in vain do you not leave
your house and take up
your quarters in another
but in this case the house
was the terrestrial globe
there are no means of
leaving that house for the
moon or mars or venus
or jupiter or any other
planet of the solar system
and so of necessity we
have to find out what it is
that takes place not in the
infinite void but within
the atmospherical zones
in fact if there is no air
there is no noise and as
there was a noise - that
famous trumpet to wit-
the phenomenon must oc-
cur in the air the density
of which invariably dimin-
ishes and which does not
extend for more than
some miles round our
spheroid

  naturally the news-
papers took up the question in their thousands and
treated it in every form throwing on it both light and
darkness recording many things about it true or
false alarming and tranquilizing their readers-as
the sale required-and almost driving ordinary peo-
ple mad at one blow party politics dropped un-

 the quarrel
 neither

 -dobur the conqueror was issued in s

  -v coincident with the earliest practical interest which
began to stir the world in regard to the conquest of the
air with his usual boldly scientific imagination verne
having studied the question thoroughly from all sides
looked into the future formed a judgmirrt and pictured
the conquering air machine in the style he believed most
likely to achieve success

  in his poetical climax verne declares that robur is the
spirit of the future and it is true that even to-day we
can build no machine to match the albatross we have
however far outdistanced the historical account of avia-
tion which verne gives us in the course of his story and
which necessarily ccases with the early eighties the
experiments of professor langley in washington in 
started the world on toward a true knozvlcdge of the laws
of flight since then count zeppelin and a dozen others
in the lighter than air machines and the wright
brothers and a hundred others in those heavier than air
have achieved results which scarce any but verne himself
had even dreamed of when he wrote robur the
conqueror

  it is interesting to note that for many years after the
publication of vernes ideas the contest between the two
jschools the lighter-than-air and the heavier-than-air lias
been raging the zeppelinists in the meanwhile had their
say white the airplane adherents had theirs yet it should
be noted that it is most likely that a machine of the verne
type will in the end prevail the lighter-than-air machines
of the zeppelin type will probably never be used com-
mercially to any great extent due to their exceedingly
high cost for one thing and second due to the difficulty
in navigating these huge monsters of the air as for
vernes still more radically heavy ship sustained aloft
by the direct lift of her screws nothing in the least
practical has as yet been achieved in that line

  nearly twenty years after writing robur jules verne
turned again to the same theme and in  the very
year of his death his faithful publishers the hetzels
issued the master of the world this is a sequel to
robur the conqueror and will be published by us im-
mediately after robur the sequel clearly evidences
that the inventive power of the aged master and his skill
in conceiving and portraying a dramatic climax remained
unimpaired even to the end

  for the background of this story verne returns chiefly
to the region of lake eric and niagara the tremendous
cataract which had so impressed him on his visit to it
nearly forty years before and which he had described in
the floating city


amazing stories

heeded-and the affairs of the world went on none
the worse for it

  but what could this thing be there was not an
observatory that was not applied to if an observa-
tory could not give a satisfactory answer what was
the use of observatories if astronomers who
doubled and tripled the stars a hundred thousand
million miles away could not explain a phenomenon
occurring only a few miles off what was the use of
astronomers 

  the observatory at paris was very guarded in
what it said in the mathematical section they had
not thought the statement worth noticing in the
meridional section they knew nothing about it in
the physical observatory they had not come across it
in the geodetic section they had had no observation
in the meteorological section there had been no rec-
ord in the calculating room they had had nothing
to deal with at any rate the confession was a frank
one and the same frankness characterized the replies
from the observatory of montsouris and the magnetic
station in the park of st maur the same respect
for the truth distinguished the bureau des longi-
tudes

  the provinces were slightly more affirmative
perhaps in the night of the fifth and morning of the
sixth of may there had appeared a flash of light of
electrical origin which lasted about twenty seconds
at the pic du midi this light appeared between nine
and ten in the evening at the meteorological ob-
servatory on the puy de dome the light had been
observed between one and two oclock in the morn-
ing at mont ventoux in provence it had been seen
between two and three oclock at nice it had been
noticed between three and four oclock while at the
semnoz alps between annecy le bourget and le
leman it had been detected just as the zenith was
paling with the dawn

  now it evidently would not do to disregard these
observations altogether there could be no doubt
that a light had been observed at different places in
succession at intervals during some hours hence
whether it had been produced from many centers in
the terrestrial atmosphere or from one center it was
plain that the light must have traveled at a speed of
over one hundred and twenty miles an hour

  in the united kingdom there was much per-
plexity the observatories were not in agreement
greenwich would not consent to the proposition of
oxford they were agreed on one point however
and that was it was nothing at all

  but said one it was an optical illusion while
the other contended that it was an acoustical illu-
sion  and so they disputed something how-
ever was it will be seen common to both it was
an illusion

  between the observatory of berlin and the observ-
atory of vienna the discussion threatened to end in
international complications but russia in the per-
son of the director of the observatory at pulkowa
showed that both were right it all depended on
the point of view from which they attacked the
phenomenon which though impossible in theory
was possible in practice

  in switzerland at the observatory of sautis in the
canton of appenzell at the righi at the gabriss in
the passes of the st gothard at the st bernard at
the julier at the simplon at zurich at somblick in

the tyrolean alps there was a very strong disin-
clination to say anything about what nobody could
prove-and that was nothing but reasonable

  but in italy at the meteorological stations on
vesuvius on etna in the casa inglesi at monte
cavo the observers made no hesitation in admitting
the materiality of the phenomenon particularly as
they had seen it by day in the form of a small cloud
of vapor and by night in that of a shooting star
but of what it was they knew nothing

scientists began at last to tire of the mystery
while they continued to disagree about it and
even to frighten the lowly and the ignorant who
thanks to one of the wisest laws of nature have
formed form and will form the immense majority
of the worlds inhabitants astronomers and meteo-
rologists would soon have dropped the subject alto-
gether had not on the night of the th and th the
observatory of kautokeino at finmark in norway
and during the night of the th and th that of
isf jord at spitzbergen-norwegian one and swedish
the other-found themselves agreed in recording that
in the center of an aurora borealis there had ap-
peared a sort of huge bird an aerial monster whose
structure they were unable to determine but who
there was no doubt was showering off from his
body certain corpuscles which exploded like bombs

  in europe not a doubt was thrown on this obser-
vation of the stations in finmark and spitzbergen
but what appeared the most phenomenal about it was
that the swedes and norwegians could find them-
selves in agreement on any subject whatever

  there was a laugh at the asserted discovery in all
the observatories of south america in brazil peru
and la plata and in those of australia at sydney
adelaide and melbourne and australian laughter
is very catching

  to sum up only one chief of a meteorological
station ventured on a decided answer to this ques-
tion notwithstanding the sarcasms that his solution
provoked this was a chinaman the director of the
observatory at zi-ka-wey which rises in the center
of a vast plateau less than thirty miles from the sea
having an immense horizon and wonderfully pure
atmosphere it is possible said he that the
object was an aviform apparatus-a flying machine

  what nonsense

  but if the controversy was keen in the old world
we can imagine what it was like in that portion of
the new of which the united states occupy so vast
an area

  a yankee we know does not waste time on the
road he takes the street that leads him straight
to his end and the observatories of the american
federation did not hesitate to do their best if
they did not hurl their objectives at each others
heads it was because they would have had to put
them back just when they most wanted to use them
in this much-disputed question the observatories of
washington in the district of columbia and cam-
bridge in massachusetts found themselves opposed
by those of dartmouth college in new hampshire
and ann arbor in michigan the subject of their
dispute was not the nature of the body observed but
the precise moment of its observation all of them
claimed to have seen it the same night the same hour
the same minute the same second although the
robur the conqueror



trajectory of the mysterious voyager took it but a
moderate height above the horizon now from
massachusetts to michigan from new hampshire
to columbia the distance is too great for this double
observation made at the same moment to be con-
sidered possible

  dudley at albany in the state of new york and
west point the military academy showed that their
colleagues were wrong by an elaborate calculation of
the right ascension and declination of the aforesaid
body

  but later on it was discovered that the observers
had been deceived in the body and that what they
had seen was an aerolite this aerolite could not
be the object in question for how could an aerolite
blow a trumpet 

  it was in vain that they tried to get rid of this
trumpet as an acoustical illusion the ears were no
more deceived than the eyes something had as-
suredly been seen and something had assuredly been
heard in the night of the th and th of may-
a very dark night-the observers at yale college
in the sheffield science school had been able to take
down a few bars of a musical phrase in d major
common time which gave note for note rhythm
for rhythm the chorus of the chant du depart

  good said the yankee wags there is a
french band well up in the air

  but to joke is not to answer thus said the
observatory at boston founded by the atlantic iron
works society whose opinions in matters of astron-
omy and meteorology began to have much weight in
the world of science

  then there intervened the observatory at cincin-
nati founded in  on mount lookout thanks
to the generosity of mr kilgour and known for its
micrometrical measurements of double stars its
director declared with the utmost good faith that
there had certainly been something that a traveling
body had shown itself at very short periods at differ-
ent points in the atmosphere but what were the na-
ture of this body its dimensions its speed and its
trajectory it was impossible to say

  it was then that a journal whose publicity is im-
mense-the new york herald-received the anony-
mous contribution hereunder

  there will be in the recollection of most people
the rivalry which existed a few years ago between
the two heirs of the begum of ragginahra the
french doctor sarrasin in the city of frankville
and the german engineer schultze in the city of
steeltown both in the south of oregon in the
united states

  it will not have been forgotten that with the
object of destroying frankville herr schultze
launched a formidable engine intended to beat down
the town and annihilate it at a single blow

  still less will it be forgotten that this engine
whose initial velocity as it left the mouth of the
monster cannon had been erroneously calculated had
flown off at a speed exceeding by sixteen times that
of ordinary projectiles-or about four hundred and
fifty miles an hour-that it did not fall to the ground
and that it passed into an aerolitic stage so as to
circle for ever round our globe

  why should not this be the body in question

  very ingenious mr correspondent of the new
york herald but how about the trumpet there
was no trumpet in herr schultzes projectile

  so all the explanations explained nothing and all
the observers had observed in vain there remained
only the suggestion offered by the director of zi-ka-
wey but the opinion of a chinaman 

  the discussion continued and there was no sign
of agreement then came a short period of rest
some days elapsed without any object aerolite or
otherwise being descried and without any trumpet
notes being heard in the atmosphere the body then
had fallen on some part of the globe where it had
been difficult to trace it into the sea perhaps had
it sunk in he depths of the atlantic the pacific or
the indian ocean what was to be said in this
matter 

  but then between the nd and th of june there
came a new series of facts which could not possibly
be explained by the unaided existence of a cosmic
phenomenon

  in a week the hamburgers at the top of st
michaels tower the turks on the highest minaret
of st sophia the rouennais at the end of the metal
spire of their cathedral the strasburgers at the sum-
mit of their minster the americans on the head of
the liberty statue at the entrance of the hudson and
on the bunker hill monument at boston the chinese
at the spike of the temple of the four hundred
genii at canton the hindoos on the sixteenth ter-
race of the pyramid of the temple at tanjore the
san pietrini at the cross of st peters at rome the
english at the cross of st pauls in london the
egyptians at the apex of the great pyramid of
ghizeh the parisians at the lightning conductor of
the iron tower of the exposition of  a thousand
feet high all of them beheld a flag floating from
some one of these inaccessible points

  and the flag was black jotted with stars and it
bore a golden sun in its ceer

agreement impossible

 a nd the first who say the contrary-

          indeed but we will say the contrary
  j v so long as there is a place to say it in

  and in spite of your threats-

  mind what you are saying bat fynn

mind what you are saying uncle prudent

  i maintain that the screw ought to be behind
and so do we and so do we replied half a
hundred voices mingled into one

  no it ought to be in front shouted phil
evans

  in front roared fifty other voices with a vigor
in no whit less remarkable

  we shall never agree

  never never

  then what is the use of a dispute

  it is not a dispute it is a discussion

  one would not have thought so to listen to the
taunts objurgations and vociferations which filled
the lecture room for a good quarter of an hour

  the room was one of the largest in the weldon
institute the well-known club in walnut street
philadelphia pennsylvania u s a the evening
before there had been an election of a lamplighter
occasioning many public manifestations noisy meet-
ings and even interchanges of blows resulting in an
effervescence which had not yet subsided and which


amazing stories

would account for some of the excitement just ex-
hibited by the members of the weldon institute
for this was merely a meeting of balloonists dis-
cussing the burning question of the direction of bal-
loons

   in this great saloon there were struggling pushing
gesticulating shouting arguing disputing a hun-
dred balloonists all with their hats on under the
authority of a president assisted by a secretary and
treasurer they were not engineers by profession
but simply amateurs of all that appertained to aero-
statics and they were amateurs in a fury and es-
pecially foes of those who would oppose balloons
apparatuses heavier than the air flying machines
aerial ships or what not that these people might
one day discover the method of guiding balloons is
possible there could be  doubt that their presi-
dent had considerable difficulty in guiding them

  this president well known in philadelphia was
the famous uncle prudent prudent being his family
name there is nothing surprising in america in
the qualificative uncle since you can there be uncle
without having either nephew or niece there they
speak of uncle as in other places they speak of father
though the father may have had no children

  uncle prudent was a personage of consideration
and in spite of his name was well known for his
audacity he was very rich and that is no draw-
back even in the united states and how could it be
otherwise when he owned the greater part of the
shares in niagara falls a society of engineers
had just been founded at buffalo for working the
cataract it seemed to be an excellent speculation
the seven thousand five hundred cubic meters that
pass over niagara in a second would produce seven
millions of horse-powow this enormous power
distributed amongst all tl- workshops within a radius
of three hundred miles would return an annual in-
come of three hundred million dollars of which the
greater part would find its way into the pocket of
uncle prudent he was a bachelor he lived quietly
and for his only servant had his valet frycollin who
was hardly worthy of being the servant to so auda-
cious a master

  uncle prudent was rich and therefore he had
friends as was natural but he also had enemies al-
though he was president of the club-among others
all those who envied his position amongst his bit-
terest foes we may mention the secretary of the
weldon institute

  this was phil evans who was also very rich be-
ing the manager of the wheelton watch company
an important manufactory which makes every day
five hundred movements equal in every respect to the
swiss workmanship phil evans would have passed
for one of the happiest men in the world and even in
the united states if it had not been for uncle pru-
dent like him he was in his forty-sixth year like
him of invariable health like him of undoubted
boldness they were two men made to understand
each other thoroughly but they did not for both
were of extreme violence of character uncle pru-
dent was furiously hot phil evans was abnormally
cool

  and why had not phil evans been elected presi-
dent of the club the votes were exactly divided
between uncle prudent and him twenty times
there had been a scrutiny and twenty times the ma-

jority had not declared for either one or the other
the position was embarrassing and it might have
lasted for the lifetime of the candidates

  one of the members of the club then proposed a
way out of the difficulty this was jem chip the
treasurer of the weldon institute chip was a con-
firmed vegetarian a proscriber of all animal nourish-
ment of all fermented liquors half a mussulman
half a brahman on this occasion jem chip was
supported by another member of the club william
t forbes the manager of a large factory where
they made glucose by treating rags with sulphuric
acid a man of good standing was this william t
forbes the father of two charming girls-miss
dorothy called doll and miss martha called mat
who gave the tone to the best society in philadelphia

  it followed then on the proposition of jem chip
supported by william t forbes and others that it
was decided to elect the president on the center
point

  this mode of election can be applied in all cases
when it is desired to elect the most worthy and a
number of americans of high intelligence are already
thinking of employing it in the nomination of the
president of the republic of the united states

  on two boards of perfect whiteness a black line is
traced the length of each of these lines is mathe-
matically the same for they have been determined
with as much accuracy as the base of the first tri-
angle in a trigonometrical survey that done the
two boards were erected on the same day in the cen-
ter of the conference room and the two candidates
each armed with a fine needle marched towards the
board that had fallen to his lot the man who
planted his needle nearest the center of his line would
be proclaimed president of the weldon institute

  the operation must be done at once-no guide
marks or trial shots allowed nothing but sureness
of eye the man must have a compass in his eye
as the saying goes that was all

  uncle prudent stuck in his needle at the same
moment as phil evans did his then there began the
measurement to discover which of the two competi-
tors had almost nearly approached the center

  wonderful such had been the precision of the
shots that the measures gave no appreciable differ-
ence if they were not exactly in the mathematical
center of the line the distance between the needles
was so small as to be invisible to the naked eye

  the meeting was much embarrassed

  fortunately one of the members truck milnor
insisted that the measurements should be remade by
means of a rule graduated by the micrometrical ma-
chine of m perreaux which can divide a millimeter
into fifteen hundred parts this rule dividing the
fifteen-hundredths of a millimeter with a diamond
splinter was brought to bear on the lines and on
reading the divisions through a microscope the fol-
lowing were the results uncle prudent had ap-
proached the center within less than six fifteen-hun-
dredths of a millimeter phil evans was within nine
fifteen-hundredths

  and that is why phil evans was only secretary
of the weldon institute whereas uncle prudent was
president a difference of three fifteen-hundredths
of a millimeter and on account of it phil evans
vowed against uncle prudent one of those hatreds
which are none the less fierce for being latent
robur the conqueror



chapter iii

a visitor is announced

the many experiments made during this last
quarter of the nineteenth century have given
considerable impetus to the question of dirigi-
ble balloons the cars furnished with propellers
attached in  to the aerostats of the elongated
form introduced by henry giffard the machines of
dupuy de lome in  of the tissandier brothers
in  and of captains krebs and renard in 
yielded many important results but if these ma-
chines moving in a medium heavier than themselves
maneuvering under the propulsion of a screw work-
ing at an angle to the direction of the wind and even
against the wind to return to their point of de-
parture had been really dirigible they had only
succeeded under very favorable conditions in large
covered halls their success was perfect in a calm
atmosphere they did very well in a light wind of
five or six yards a second they still moved but noth-
ing practical had been obtained against a millers
wind-nine yards a second-the machines had re-
mained almost stationary against a fresh breeze-
eleven yards a second-they would have advanced
backwards in a storm-twenty-seven to thirty-three
yards a second-they would have been blown about
like a feather in a hurricane-sixty yards a second
-they would have run the risk of being dashed to
pieces and in one of those cyclones which exceed
a hundred yards a second not a fragment of them
would have been left it remained then even after
the striking experiments of captains krebs and
renard that though dirigible aerostats had gained a
little speed they could not be kept going in a moder-
ate breeze hence the impossibility of making prac-
tical use of this mode of aerial locomotion

  with regard to the means employed to give the
aerostat its motion a great deal of progress had been
made for the steam engines of henry giffard and
the muscular force of dupuy de lome electric mo-
tors had gradually been substituted the batteries
of bichromate of potassium of the tissandier broth-
ers had given a speed of four yards a second the
dynamo-electric machines of captains krebs and
renard had developed a force of twelve horsepower
and yielded a speed of six and a half yards per sec-
ond

  with regard to this motor engineers and elec-
tricians had been approaching more and more to that
desideratum which is known as a steam horse in a
watch case gradually the results of the battery of
which captains krebs and renard had kept the
secret had been surpassed and aeronauts had become
able to avail themselves of motors whose lightness
increased at the same time as their power

  in this there was much to encourage those who be-
lieved in the utilization of dirigible balloons but yet
how many good people there ere who refuse to ad-
mit the possibility of such a thing if the aerostat
finds support in the air it lelongs to the medium in
which it moves under such conditions how can its
mass which offers so much resistance to the currents
of the atmosphere make its way against the wind 

  in this struggle of the inventors after a light and
powerful motor the americans had most nearly at-
tained what they sought a dynamo-electric appara-
tus in which a new battery was employed the com-

position of which was still a mystery had been
bought from its inventor a boston chemist up to
then unknown calculations made with the greatest
care diagrams drawn with the utmost exactitude
showed that by means of this apparatus driving a
screw of given dimensions a displacement could be
obtained of from twenty to twenty-two yards a
second

  now this was magnificent

  and it is not dear said uncle prudent as he
handed to the inventor in return for his formal re-
ceipt the last instalment of the hundred thousand
paper dollars he had paid for his invention

  immediately the weldon institute set to work
when there comes along a project of practical utility
the money leaps nimbly enough from american
pockets the funds flowed in even without its being
necessary to form a syndicate three hundred thou-
sand dollars came into the clubs account at the first
appeal the work began under the superintendence
of the most celebrated aeronaut of the united states
harry w tinder immortalized by three of his
ascents out of a thousand one in which he rose to a
height of twelve thousand yards higher than gay
lussac coxwell sivet croce-spinelli tissandier
glaisher another in which he had crossed america
from new york to san francisco exceeding by
many hundred leagues the journeys of nadar go-
dard and others to say nothing of that of john wise
who accomplished eleven hundred and fifty miles
from st louis to jefferson county the third which
ended in a frightful fall from fifteen hundred feet at
the cost of a slight sprain in the right thumb while
the less fortunate pilatre de rozier fell only seven
hundred feet and yet killed himself on the spot

  at the time this story begins the weldon institute
had got their work well in hand in the turner yard
at philadelphia there reposed an enormous aerostat
whose strength had been tried by highly compressed
air it well merited the name of the monster balloon

  how large was nadars geant six thousand
cubic meters how large was john wises balloon
twenty thousand cubic meteis how large was the
giffard balloon at the  exhibition twenty-five
thousand cubic meters compare these three aero-
stats with the aerial machine of the weldon institute
whose volume amounted to forty thousand cubic
meters and you will understand why uncle prudent
and his colleagues were so justifiably proud of it

  this balloon not being destined for the exploration
of the higher strata of the atmosphere was not called
the excelsior a name which is rather too much held
in honor among the citizens of america no it was
called simply the go-ahead and all it had to do was
to justify its name by going ahead obediently to the
wishes of its commander

  the dynamo-electric machine made according to
the patent purchased by the weldon institute was
nearly ready in less than six weeks the go-ahead
would start for its first cruise through space

  but as we have seen all the mechanical difficulties
had not been overcome many evenings had been
devoted to discussing not the form of its screw nor
its dimensions but whether it ought to be put behind
as the tissandier brothers had done or before as
captains krebs and renard had done it is un-
necessary to add that the partisans of the two sys-
tems had almost come to blows the group of be-
forists were equaled in number by the group of


amazing stories

behindists uncle prudent who ought to have
given the casting vote-uncle prudent brought up
doubtless in the school of professor buridan-could
not bring himself to decide

  hence the impossibility of getting the screw into
place the dispute might last for some time unless
the government interfered but in the united states
the government meddles with private affairs as little
as it possibly can and it is right

  things were in this state at this meeting on the
th of june which threatened to end in a riot-in-
sults exchanged fisticuffs succeeding the insults cane
thrashings succeeding the fisticuffs revolver shots
succeeding the cane thrashings-when at thirty-seven
minutes past eight there occurred a diversion

  the porter of the weldon institute coolly and
calmly like a policeman amid the storm of the meet-
ing approached the presidential desk on it he
placed a card he awaited the orders that uncle
prudent found it convenient to give

  uncle prudent turned on the steam whistle which
did duty for the presidential bell for even the krem-
lin clock would have struck in vain but the tumult
slackened not

  then the president removed his hat thanks to
this extreme measure a semi-silence was obtained

  a communication- said uncle prudent after
taking a huge pinch from the snuff-box which never
left him

  speak up answered eighty-nine voices acci-
dentally in agreement on this one point

  a stranger my dear colleagues asks to be ad-
mitted to the meeting

  never replied every voice

  he desires to prove to us it would appear con-
tinued uncle prudent hat to believe in guiding
balloons is to believe inabsurdest of utopias

  let him in  let himtn 

  what is the name of this singular personage
asked secretary phil evans

  robur replied uncle prudent

  robur kobur robur yelled the assembly
and the welcome accorded so quickly to the curious
name was chiefly due to the weldon institute hoping
to vent its exasperation on the head of him who bore
it

chapter iv

in which a new character appears

citizens of the united states my name

  i is robur i am worthy of the name i am
forty years old although i look but thirty
and i have a constitution of iron a healthy vigor that
nothing can shake a muscular strength that few can
equal and a digestion that would be thought first
class even in an ostrich

  they were listening yes the riot was quelled
at once by the totally unexpected fashion of the
speech was this fellow a madman or a hoaxer
whoever he was he kept his audience in hand
there was not a whisper in the meeting in which
but a few minutes ago the storm was in full fury

  and robur looked the man he said he was of
middle height and geometric breadth his figure was
a regular trapezoid with the greatest of its parallel
sides formed by the line of his shoulders on this
line attached by a robust neck there rose an enormous
spheroidal head the head of what animal did it

resemble from the point of view of passional anal-
ogy the head of a bull but a bull with an intelli-
gent face eyes which at the least opposition would
glow like coals of fire and above them a permanent
contraction of the superciliary muscle an invariable
sign of extreme energy short hair slightly woolly
with metallic reflections large chest rising and fall-
ing like a smiths bellows arms hands legs feet
all worthy of the trunk no mustaches no whiskers
but a large american goatee revealing the attach-
ments of the jaw whose masseter muscles were
evidently of formidable strength it has been cal-
culated-what has not been calculated -that the
pressure of the jaw of an ordinary crocodile can
reach four hundred atmospheres while that of a
hound can only amount to one hundred from this
the following curious formula has been deduced-
if a kilogram of dog produces eight kilograms of
masseteric force a kilogram of crocodile could pro-
duce twelve now a kilogram of the aforesaid
robur would not produce less than ten so that he
came between the dog and the crocodile

  from what country did this remarkable specimen
come  it was difficult to say one thing was notice-
able and that was that he expressed himself fluently
in english without a trace of the drawling twang
that distinguishes the yankees of new england

  he continued and now honorable citizens for
my mental faculties you see before you an engineer
whose nerves are in no way inferior to his muscles
i have no fear of anything or anybody i have a
strength of will that has never had to yield when
i have decided on a thing all america all the world
may strive in vain to keep me from it when i have
an idea i allow no one to share it and i do not per-
mit any contradiction i insist on these details
honorable citizens because it is necessary you should
quite understand me perhaps you think i am talk-
ing too much about myself  it does not matter if
you do and now consider a little before you inter-
rupt me as i have come to tell you something that
you may not be particularly pleased to hear

  a sound as of the surf on the beach began to rise
along the first row of seats-a sign that the sea
would not be long in getting stormy again

  speak stranger said uncle prudent who had
some difficulty in restraining himself

  and robur spoke as follows without troubling
himself any more about his audience

  yes i know it well after a century of experi-
ments that have led to nothing and trials giving no
result there still exist ill-balanced minds who believe
in dirigible balloons they imagine that a motor of
some sort electric or otherwise might be applied
to their pretentious skin bags which are at the mercy
of every current in the atmosphere they persuade
themselves that they can be masters of an aerostat
as they can be masters of a ship on the surface of
the sea because a few inventors in calm or nearly
calm weather have succeeded in working on an angle
with the wind or even going to windward in a gentle
breeze they think that the steering of aerial appa-
ratus lighter than the air is a practicable matter
well now look here you hundred who believe in
the realization of your dreams are throwing your
thousands of dollars not into water but into space
you are fighting the impossible

  strange it was that at this affirmation the mem-
bers of the weldon institute did not move  lad
robur the conqueror



they become as deai  they were patient or were
they reserving themselves to see how far this auda-
cious contradictor would dare to go

  robur continued what  a balloon when
to obtain the raising of a couple of pounds you
require a cubic yard of gas a balloon pretending
to resist the wind by aid of its mechanism when
the pressure of a light breeze on a vessels sails is
not less than that of four hundred horsepower when
in the accident at the tay bridge you saw the storm
produce a pressure of eight and a half hundredweight
on a square yard a balloon when on such a sys-
tem nature has never constructed anything flying
whether furnished with wings like birds or mem-
branes like certain fish or certain mammalia-

  mammalia exclaimed one of the members

  yes mammalia the bat which flies if i am
not mistaken is the gentleman unaware that this
flier is a mammal  did he ever see an omelette
made of bats eggs

  the interrupter reserved himself for future inter-
ruption and robur resumed but does that mean
that man is to give up the conquest of the air and
the transformation of the domestic and political
manners of the old world by the use of this admir-
able means of locomotion by no means as he
has become master of the seas with the ship by the
oar the sail the wheel and the screw so shall he
become master of atmospherical space by apparatus
heavier than the air-for it must be heavier to be
stronger than the air

  and then the assembly exploded what a broad-
side of yells escaped from all these mouths aimed
at robur like the muzzles of so many guns was
not this hurling a declaration of war into the very
camp of the balloonists was not this a stirring up
of strife between the lighter and the heavier
than air

  robur did not even frown with folded arms he
waited bravely till silence was obtained

  by a gesture uncle prudent ordered the firing to
cease

  yes continued robur the future is for the
flying machine the air affords a solid fulcrum
if you will give a column of air an ascensional move-
ment of forty-five meters a second a man can sup-
port himself on the top of it if the soles of his boots
have a superficies of only the eighth of a square
meter and if the speed be increased to ninety
meters he can walk on it with naked feet or if
by means of a screw you drive a mass of air at
this speed you get the same result

  what robur said had been said before by all the
partisans of aviation whose work slowly but surely
is leading on to the solution of the problem to
ponton damecourt la landelle nadar de luzy
de louvrie liais beleguir moreau the brothers
richard babinet jobert du temple salives pen-
aud de villeneuve gauchot and tatin michel
loup edison planavergne and so many others
belongs the honor of having brought forward ideas
of such simplicity abandoned and resumed times
without number they are sure some day to triumph
to the enemies of aviation who urge that the bird
only sustains himself by warming the air he strikes
their answer is ready have they not proved that
an eagle weighing five kilograms would have to fill
fifty cubic meters with his warm fluid merely to
sustain himself in space

  this is what robur demonstrated with undeniable
logic amid the uproar that arose on all sides and
in conclusion these are the words he hurled in the
faces of the balloonists with your balloons you
can do nothing-you will arrive at nothing-you
dare do nothing the boldest of your aeronauts
john wise although he has made an aerial voyage
of twelve hundred miles above the american conti-
nent has had to give up his project of crossing the
atlantic and you have not advanced a step-not
one step-towards your end

  sir said the president who in vain endeavored
to keep himself cool you forget what was said by
our immortal franklin at the first appearance of the
fire balloon it is but a child but it will grow it
was but a child and it has grown

  no mr president it has not grown it has got
fatter-and that is not the same thing

  this was a direct attack on the weldon institute
which had decreed helped and paid for the making
of a monster balloon and so propositions of the
following kind began to fly about the room turn
him out throw him off the platform prove
that he is heavier than the air

but these were only words not means to an end
robur remained impassible and continued
there is no progress for your aerostats my citizen
balloonists progress is for flying machines the
bird flies and he is not a balloon he is a piece of
mechanism

  yes he flies exclaimed the fiery bat t fynn
but he flies against all the laws of mechanics
indeed said robur shrugging his shoulders
and resuming since we have begun the study of
the flight of large and snail birds one simple idea
has prevailed-to imitate nature which never makes
mistakes between the aloatross which gives hardly
ten beats of the wing per minute between the pelican

which gives seventy-

  seventy-one said the voice of a scoffer

  and the bee which gives one hundred and ninety-

two per second-

  one hundred and ninety-three said the face-
tious individual

  and the common house fly which gives three

hundred and thirty-

  and a half

  and the mosquito which gives millions-

  no milliards

  but robur the interrupted interrupted not his

demonstration between these different rates-

he continued

  there is a difference said a voice

  there is a possibility of finding a practical solu-
tion when de lucy showed that the stag beetle
an insect weighing only two grammes could lift a
weight of four hundred grammes or two hundred
times its own weight the problem of aviation was
solved besides it has been shown that the wing
surface decreases in proportion to the increase of
the size and weight of the animal hence we can

look forward to such contrivances-

  which would never fly said secretary phil
evans

  which have flown and which will fly said
robur without being in the least disconcerted and
which we can call streophores helicopters orthopters
or in imitation of the word nef which comes


amazing stories

from navis or call them efs from avis-by
means of which man will become the master of space

the helix-

  ah the helix replied phil evans but the
bird has no helix that we know

  so said robur but penaud has shown that
in reality the bird makes a helix and its flight is
helicopteral and the motor of the future is the
screw-

          from such a maladee
          saint helix keep us free

sung out one of the members who had accidentally
hit upon the air from heralds zampa

  and they all took up the chorus

          from such a maladee
          saint helix keep us free

with such intonations and variations as would have
made the french composer groan in his grave

  as the last notes died away in a frightful discord
uncle prudent took advantage of the momentary
calm to say stranger up to now we let you speak
without interruption

  it seemed that for the president of the weldon
institute shouts yells and catcalls were not inter-
ruptions but only an exchange of arguments

  but i may remind you all the same that the
theory of aviation is condemned beforehand and
rejected by the majority of american and foreign
engineers it is a system which was the cause of
the death of the flying saracen at constantinople
of the monk volador at lisbon of de leturn in
 of de groof in  besides the victims i

forget since the mythological icarus-

  a system replied rbur no more to be con-
demned than that whosemartyrology contains the
names of pilatre de rozier at calais of blanchard
at paris of donaldson and grimwood in lake
michigan of sivel and of croce-spinelli and others
whom it takes good care to forget

  this was a counter-thrust with a vengeance
besides continued robur with your balloons
as good as you can make them you will never obtain
any speed worth mentioning it would take you ten
years to go round the world-and a flying machine
could do it in a week

  here arose a new tempest of protests and denials
which lasted for three long minutes and then phil
evans took up the word

  mr aviator he said you who talk so much
of the benefits of aviation have you ever aviated
i have

  and made the conquest of the air

  not unlikely

  hooray for robur the conqueror shouted an
ironical voice

  well yes robur the conqueror i accept the
name and i will bear it for i have a right to it

  we beg to doubt it said jem chip
gentlemen said robur and his brows knit
when i have just seriously stated a serious thing i
do not permit anyone to reply to me by a flat denial
and i shall be glad to know the name of the
interrupter

  my name is chip and i am a vegetarian
citizen chip said robur i knew that vege-
tarians had longer alimentary canals than other men

-a good foot longer at the least that is quite long
enough and so do not compel me to make yours
any longer by beginning at your ears and-

  throw him out

  into the street with him

  lynch him

  helix him

  the rage of the balloonists burst forth at last

  they rushed at the platform robur disappeared
amid a sheaf of hands that were thrown about as
if caught in a storm in vain the steam whistle
screamed its fanfares over the assembly philadel-
phia might well think that a fire was devouring one
of its quarters and that all the waters of the schuyl-
kill could not put it out

  suddenly there was a recoil in the tumult robur
had put his hands into his pockets withdrawn them
and now held them out at the front ranks of the
infuriated mob

  in each hand was one of those american institu-
tions known as revolvers which the mere pressure of
the fingers is enough to fire-pocket mitrailleuses in
fact

  and taking advantage not only of the recoil of
his assailants but also of the silence which accom-
panied it

  decidedly said he it was not amerigo that
discovered the new world it was cabot you are
not americans citizen balloonists you are only
cabo-

  four or five pistol shots cracked out fired into
space they hurt nobody amid the smoke the
engineer vanished and when it had thinned away
there was no trace of him robur the conqueror
had flown as if some apparatus of aviation had borne
him into the air

chapter v

another disappearance

this was not the first occasion on which at
the end of their stormy discussions the mem-
bers of the weldon institute had filled walnut
street and its neighborhood with their tumult sev-
eral times had the inhabitants complained of the
noisy way in which the proceedings ended and more
than once had the policemen had to interfere to clear
the thoroughfare for the passersby who for the
most part were supremely indifferent on this question
of aerial navigation but never before had the
tumult attained such proportions never had the com-
plaints been better founded never had the interven-
tion of the police been more necessary

  but there was some excuse for the members of
the weldon institute they had been attacked in
their own house to these enthusiasts for lighter
than air a no less enthusiast for heavier than air
had said things absolutely abhorrent and at the
moment they were about to treat him as he deserved
he had disappeared

  so they cried aloud for vengeance to leave such
insults unpunished was impossible to all with ameri-
can blood in their veins had not the sons of
amerigo been called the sons of cabot was not
that an insult as unpardonable as it happened to be
just-historically

  the members of the club in several groups rushed
down walnut street then into the adjoining streets
robur the conqueror



and then all over the neighborhood they woke
up the householders they compelled them to search
their houses prepared to indemnify them later on
for the outrage on their privacy vain were all
their trouble and searching robur was nowhere
to be found there was no trace of him he might
have gone off in the go-ahead the balloon of the
institute for all they could tell after an hours
hunt the members had to give in and separate not
before they had agreed to extend their search over
the whole territory of the twin americas that form
the new continent

  by eleven oclock quiet had been restored in the
neighborhood of walnut street philadelphia was
able to sink again into that sound sleep which is the
privilege of non-manufacturing towns the different
members of the club parted to seek their respective
houses to mention the most distinguished amongst
them william t forbes sought his large sugar
establishment where miss doll and miss mat had
prepared for him his evening tea sweetened with
his own glucose truck milnor took the road to
his factory in the distant suburb where the engines
worked day and night treasurer jem chip publicly
accused of possessing an alimentary canal twelve
inches longer than that of other men returned to
the vegetable soup that was waiting for him

  two of the most important balloonists-two only
-did not seem to think of returning so soon to their
domicile they availed themselves of the oppor-
tunity to discuss the question with more than usual
acrimony these were the irreconcilables uncle
prudent and phil evans the president and secre-
tary of the weldon institute

  at the door of the club the valet frycollin waited
for uncle prudent his master and at last he went
after him though he cajed but little for the subject
which had set the two colleagues at loggerheads

  it is only by an euphemism that the verb discuss
can be used to express the way in which the duet
between the president and secretary was being per-
formed as a matter of fact they were in full
wrangle with an energy born of their old rivalry

  no sir no said phil evans if i had had the
honor of being president of the weldon institute
there never no never would have been such a
scandal

  and what would you have done if youhad had
the honor demanded uncle prudent

   would have stopped the insulter before he had
opened his mouth

  it seems to me it would have been impossible to
stop him until he had opened his mouth replied
uncle prudent

  not in america sir not in america

and exchanging such observations increasing
in bitterness as they went they walked on
through the streets farther and farther from their
homes until they reached a part of the city whence
they had to go a long way round to get back

  frycollin followed by no means at ease to see his
master plunging into such deserted spots he did
not like deserted spots particularly after midnight
in fact the darkness was profound and the moon was
only a thin crescent just beginning its monthly life
frycollin kept a lookout to the left and right of him
to see if he was followed and he fancied he could
see five or six hulking fellows dogging his footsteps

instinctively he drew nearer to his master but not
for the world would he have dared to break in on
the conversation of which the fragments reached him

  in short it so chanced that the president and sec-
retary of the weldon institute found themselves on
the road to fairmount park in the full heat of
their dispute they crossed the schuylkill river by
the famous iron bridge they met only a few belated
wayfarers and pressed on across a wide open tract
where the immense prairie was broken every now
and then by the patches of thick woodland which
make the park different from any other in the world

  there frycollins terror became acute particularly
as he saw the five or six shadows gliding after him
across the schuylkill bridge the pupils of his eyes
broadened out to the circumference of his iris and
his limbs seemed to diminish as if endowed with the
contractility peculiar to the mollusca and certain of
the articulata for frycollin the valet was an egre-
gious coward

  he was a pure south carolina negro with the
head of a fool and the carcass of an imbecile being
only one and twenty he had never been a slave not
even by birth but that made no difference to him
grinning and greedy and idle and a magnificent
poltroon he had been the servant of uncle prudent
for about three years over and over again had his
master threatened to kick him out but had kept him
on for fear of doing worse with a master ever
ready to venture on the most audacious enterprises
frycollins cowardice had brought him many arduous
trials but he had some compensation very little
had been said about his gluttony and still less about
his laziness

  ah valet frycollin if you could only have read
the future why oh viy frycollin did you not
remain at boston with the sneffels and not have
given them up when they talked of going to switzer-
land  was not that a much more suitable place for
you than this of uncle prudents where danger was
daily welcomed

  but here he was and his master had become used
to his faults he had one advantage and that was
a consideration although he was a negro by birth
he did not speak like a negro and nothing is so irri-
tating as that hateful jargon in which all the pro-
nouns are objective and all the verbs infinitive let
it be understood also that frycollin was a thorough
coward

  and now it was midnight and the pale crescent
of the moon began to sink in the west behind the
trees in the park the rays streaming fitfully
through the branches made the shadows darker than
ever frycollin looked around him anxiously
brrr he said there are those fellows there all
the time positively they are getting nearer master
uncle he shouted

  it was thus he called the president of the weldon
institute and thus did the president desire to be
called

  at the moment the dispute of the rivals had
reached its maximum and as they hurled their epi-
thets at each other they walked faster and faster
and drew farther and farther away from the schuyl-
kill bridge they had reached the center of a wide
clump of trees whose summits were just tipped by
the parting rays of the moon beyond the trees was
a very large clearing-an ovl field a complete
amphitheater not a hillock was there to hinder the


amazing stories

gallop of the horses not a bush to stop the view of
the spectators

  and if uncle prudent and phil evans had not
been so deep in their dispute and had used their
eyes as they were accustomed to they would have
found the clearing was not in its usual state was
it a flour mill that had anchored on it during the
night it looked like it with its wings and sails-
motionless and mysterious in the gathering gloom

  but neither the president nor the secretary of the
weldon institute noticed the strange modification in
the landscape of fairmount park and neither did
frycollin it seemed to him that the thieves were
approaching and preparing for their attack and he
was seized with convulsive fear paralyzed in his
limbs with every hair he could boast of on the bristle
his terror was extreme his knees bent under him
but he had just strength enough to exclaim for the
last time master uncle master uncle

  what is the matter with yon  asked uncle pru-
dent perhaps the disputants would not have been
sorry to have relieved their fury at the expense of the
unfortunate valet but they had no time and neither
even had he time to answer

  a whistle was heard a flash of electric light shot
across the clearing

  a signal doubtless the moment had come for
the deed of violence in less time than it takes to
tell six men came leaping across from under the
trees two upon uncle prudent two upon phil evans
two upon frycollin-there was no need for the two
last for the negro was incapable of defending him-
self the president and secretary of the weldon in-
stitute although taken by surprise would have re-
sisted

  they had neither time nor strength to do so in
a second they were rendered speechless by a gag
blind by a bandage thrcrfvn down pinioned and
carried bodily off across the clearing what could
they think except that they had fallen into the hands
of people who intended to rob them the people did
nothing of the sort however they did not even
touch uncle prudents pockets although according
to his custom they were full of paper dollars

  within a minute of the attack without a word
being passed uncle prudent phil evans and fry-
collin felt themselves laid gently down not on the
grass but on a sort of plank that creaked beneath
them they were laid down side by side

  a door was shut and the grating of a bolt in a
staple told them that they were prisoners

  then there came a continuous buzzing a quivering
a frrrr with the rrr unending

  and that was the only sound that broke the quiet
of the night

  great was the excitement next morning in phila-
delphia very early was it known what had passed
at the meeting of the institute everyone knew of
the appearance of the mysterious engineer named
robur - robur the conqueror - and the tumult
among the balloonists and his inexplicable disap-
pearance

  but it was quite another thing when all the town
heard that the president and secretary of the club
had also disappeared during the night

  long and keen was the search in the city and
neighborhood useless the newspapers of phila-

delphia the newspapers of pennsylvania the news-
papers of the united states reported the facts and
explained them in a hundred ways not one of which
was the right one heavy rewards were offered and
placards were pasted up but all to no purpose the
earth seemed to have opened and bodily swallowed
the president and secretary of the weldon institute

chapter vi

the president and secretary suspend hostilities

a bandage over the eyes a gag in the mouth
a cord round the wrists a cord round the
ankles unable to see to speak or to move
uncle prudent phil evans and frycollin were any-
thing but pleased with their position knowing not
who had seized them nor into what they had been
thrown like parcels in a goods wagon nor where
they were nor what was reserved for them-it was
enough to exasperate even the most patient of the
ovine race and we know that the members of the
weldon institute were not precisely sheep as far as
patience went with his violence of character we can
easily imagine how uncle prudent felt one thing
was evident that phil evans and he would find it
difficult to attend the club next evening

  as to frycollin with his eyes shut and his mouth
closed it was impossible for him to think of any-
thing he was more dead than alive

  for an hour the position of the prisoners remained
unchanged no one came to visit them or to give
them that liberty of movement and speech of which
they lay in such need they were reduced to stifled
sighs to grunts emitted over and under their gags
to everything that betrayed anger kept dumb and
fury imprisoned or rather bound down then after
many fruitless efforts they remained for some time
as though lifeless then as the sense of sight was
denied them they tried by their sense of hearing to
obtain some indication of the nature of this disquiet-
ing state of things but in vain did they seek for
any other sound than an interminable and inexplic-
able f-r-r-r which seemed to envelope them in a
quivering atmosphere

  at last something happened phil evans regain-
ing his coolness managed to slacken the cord which
bound his wrists little by little the knot slipped
his fingers slipped over each other and his hands
regained their usual freedom

  a vigorous rubbing restored the circulation a
moment after he had slipped off the bandage which
bound his eyesj taken the gag out of his mouth an
cut the cords round his ankles with his knife an
american who has not a bowie-knife in his pocket is
no longer an american

  but if phil evans had regained the power of
moving and speaking that was all his eyes were
useless to him-at present at any rate the prison
was quite dark though about six feet above him a
feeble gleam of light came in through a kind of loop-
hole

  as may be imagined phil evans did not hesitate
to at once set free his rival a few cuts with the
bowie settled the knots which bound him foot and
hand

  immediately uncle prudent rose to his knees and
snatched away his bandage and his gag

   thanks said he in a stifled voice
robur the conqueror



 no said the other no thanks

 phil evans

 uncle prudent

 here we are no longer the president and secretary
 of the weldon institute we are adversaries no
 more

 you are right answered evans we are now
 only two men agreed to avenge ourselves on a third
 whose attempt deserves severe reprisals and this

 third is-

 robur

 it is robur

 on this point both were absolutely in accord on
 this subject there was no fear of dispute

 and your servant said phil evans pointing to
 frycollin who was puffing like a grampus we
 must set him free

 not yet said uncle prudent he would over-
 whelm us with his jeremiads and we have something
 else to do than abuse each other

 what is that uncle prudent

 to save ourselves if possible

 and even if it is impossible

 you are right even if it is impossible

 there could be no doubt that this kidnapping was
 due to robur for an ordinary thief would have
 relieved them of their watches jewelry and purses
 and thrown their bodies in the schuylkill with a good
 gash in their throats instead of throwing them to the
 bottom of- of what that was a serious ques-
 tion which would have to be answered before at-
 tempting an escape with any chance of success

 phil evans began uncle prudent if when we
 came away from our meeting instead of indulging
 in amenities to which we need not recur we had kept
 our eyes more open this would not have happened
 had we remained in the streets of philadelphia there
 would have been none of this evidently robur
 foresaw what would happen at the club and had
 placed some of his bandits on guard at the door
 when we left walnut street these fellows must have
 watched us and followed us and when we impru-
 dently ventured into fairmount park they went in
 for their little game

 agreed said evans we were wrong not to go
 straight home

 it is always wrong not to be right said prudent
 here a long-drawn sigh escaped from the darkest
 corner of the prison what is that asked evans
 nothing frycollin is dreaming

 between the moment we were seized a few steps
 out into the clearing and the moment we were thrown
 in here only two minutes elapsed it is thus evident
 that these people did not take us out of fairmount
 park

 and if they had done so we should have felt we
 were being moved

 undoubtedly and consequently we must be in
 some vehicle perhaps some of those long prairie

 wagons or some show-caravan-

 evidently for if we were in a boat moored on
 the schyulkill we should have noticed the movement

 due to the current-

 that is so and as we are still in the clearing i
 think that now is the time to get away and we can

 return later to settle with this robur-

 and make him pay for this attempt on the liberty
 of two citizens of the united states

 and he shall pay pretty dearly

  but who is this man where does he come from
is he english or german or french-

  he is a scoundrel that is enough said uncle
prudent now to work and then the two men
with their hands stretched out and their fingers wide
apart began to feel round the walls to find a joint
or crack

  nothing nothing not even at the door it was
closely shut and it was impossible to shoot back the
lock all that could be done was to make a hole and
escape through the hole it remained to be seen if
the knives could cut into the walls

  but whence comes this never-ending rustling
asked evans who was much impressed at the con-
tinuous f-r-r-r

  the wind doubtless said uncle prudent

  the wind but i thought the night was quite
calm

  so it was but if it isnt the wind what can it
be

  phil evans got out the best blade of his knife and
set to work on the wall near the door perhaps he
might make a hole which would enable him to open
it from the outside should it be only bolted or should
the key have been left in the lock

  he worked away for some minutes the only
result was to nip up his knife to snip off its point
and transform what was left of the blade into a
saw

  doesnt it cut asked uncle prudent

  no

  is the wall made of sheet iron

  no it gives no metallic sound when you hit it

  is it of ironwood

   no it isnt iron and it isnt wood

  what is it then

  impossible to say iat anyhow steel doesnt
touch it

  uncle prudent in a sudden outburst of fury
began to rave and stamp on the sonorous planks
while his hands sought to strangle an imaginary
robur

e calm prudent be calm you have a try
uncle prudent had a try but the knife could
do nothing against a wall which its best blades could
not even scratch the wall seemed to be made of
crystal

  so it became evident that all flight was imprac-
ticable except through the door and for a time they
must resign themselves to their fate-not a very
pleasant thing for the yankee temperament and very
much to the disgust of these eminently practical men
but this conclusion was not arrived at without many
objurgations and loud-sounding phrases hurled at
this robur-who from what had been seen of him
at the weldon institute was not the sort of man to
trouble himself much about them

  suddenly frycollin began to give unequivocal signs
of being unwell he began to writhe in a most
lamentable fashion either with cramp in his stomach
or in his limbs and uncle prudent thinking it his
duty to put an end to these gymnastics cut the cords
that bound him

  he had cause to be sorry for it immediately there
was poured forth an interminable litany in which the
terrors of fear were mingled with the tortures of
hunger frycollin was no worse in his brain than
in his stomach and it would have been difficult to


amazing stories

decide to which organ the chief cause of the trouble
should be assigned

  frycollin said uncle prudent

  master uncle master uncle answered the
negro between two of his lugubrious howls

  it is possible that we are doomed to die of hunger
in this prison but we have made up our minds not to
succumb until we have availed ourselves of every
means of alimentation to prolong our lives

  to eat me exclaimed frycollin

  as is always done with a negro under such cir-
cumstances so you had better not make yourself

too obvious-

or youll have your bones picked  said evans
and as frycollin saw he might be used to prolong
two existences more precious than his own he con-
tented himself thenceforth with groaning in quiet

  the time went on and all attempts to force the
door or get through the wall proved fruitless what
the wall was made of was impossible to say it was
not metal it was not wood it was not stone and
 the cell seemed to be made of the same stuff
when they stamped on the floor it gave a peculiar
sound that tjncle prudent found difficult to describe
the floor seciijcd to sound hollow as if it were
not resting directly on th ground of the clearing
and the inexplicable t-r-r-r-f seemed to sweep along
below it all of which was rathei farming

  uncle prudent said phil evans

  well

  do vou think iur prisor has been moved at all 
  not that  now at

  because when we were first caught i distinctly
remember the fresh fragrance of the grass and the
resinous odor of the park frees while now wher i
take in a good sniff of tfteair it seems as though all
that had gone

  so it has

 why

  we cannot say why unless we admit that the
prison has moved and i say again that if the prison
had moved either as a vehicle on the road or a boat
on the stream we should have felt it

  here frycollin gave vent to a long groan which
might have been taken for his last had he not fol-
lowed it up with several more

  i expect robur will soon have us brought before
him said phil evans

  i hope so said uncle prudent and i shall tell

him-

  what

  that he began by being rude and ended in being
unbearable

  here phil evans noticed that day was beginning
to break a gleam still faint filtered through the
narrow window opposite the door it ought thus to
be about four oclock in the morning for it is at
that hour in the month of june in this latitude that
the horizon of philadelphia is tinged by the first rays
of the dawn

  but when uncle prudent sounded his repeater-
which was a masterpiece from his colleagues fac-
tory-the tiny gong only gave a quarter to three and
the watch had not stopped

  that is strange said phil evans at a quarter
to three it ought still to be night

perhaps my watch has got slow answered uncle
prudent

 a watch of the wheelton watch company ex-
 claimed phil evans

 whatever might be the reason there was no doubt
 hat the day was breaking gradually the window
 became white in the deep darkness of the cell how-
 ever if the dawn appeared sooner than the fortieth
 parallel permitted it did not advance with the
 rapidity peculiar to lower latitudes this was another
 observation of uncle prudents-a new inexplicable
 phenomenon

 couldnt we get up to the window and see where
 we are 

 we might said uncle prudent frycollin get
 up

 the negro arose

 put your back against the wall continued pru-
 dent and you evans get on his shoulders while i
 buttress him up

 right said evans

 an instant afterwards his knees were on fry-
 collins shoulders and his eyes were level with the
 window the window was not of lenticular glass like
 those on shipboard but was a simple flat pane it
 was small and phil evans found his range of view
 was much limited

 break the glass said prudent and perhaps you
 will be able to see better

 phil evans gave it a sharp knock with the handle
 oi hip bowie-knife it gave back a silvery sound
 but u iid not break

 another and more violent blow the same result
 it is unbreakable glass said evans

 it appeared as though the pane was made of glass
 toughened on the siemens system as after several
 blows it remained intact

 the light had now ncreased and phil evans jtuld
 see for some distance within the radius allowed by
 the frame

 what do you see asked uncle prudent

 nothing

 what not any trees

 no

 not even the top branches

 no

 then we are not in the clearing

 neither in the clearing nor in the park

 dont you see any roofs of houses or monu-
 ments said prudent whose disappointment and
 anger were increasing rapidly

 no

 what not a flagstaff nor a church tower nor a
 chimney 

 nothing but space

 as he uttered the words the door opened a man
 appeared on the threshold it was robur

 honorable balloonists he said in a serious
 voice you are now free to go and come as you
 like

 free exclaimed uncle prudent

 yes-within the limits of the albatross

 uncle prudent and phil evans rushed out of their
 prison and what did they see

 four thousand feet below them the face of a
 country they sought in vain to recognize
robur the conqueror



chapter vii

on board the albatross

ffvlt then will man cease to crawl in the depths
to live in the azure and quiet of the sky
  to this question of camille flamma-
rions the answer is easy it will be when the prog-
ress of mechanics has enabled us to solve the problem
of aviation and in a few years-as we can foresee
-a more practical utilization of electricity will do
much towards that solution

  in  before the montgolfier brothers had built
their fire-balloon and charles the physician had
devised his first aerostat a few adventurous spirits
had dreamt of the conquest of space by mechanical
means the first inventors did not think of apparatus
lighter than air for that the science of their time
did not allow them to imagine it was to contrivances
heavier than air to flying machines in imitation of
the birds that they trusted to realize aerial locomo-
tion

  this was exactly what had been done by that
madman icarus the son of daedalus whose wings
fixed together with wax had melted as they ap-
proached the sun

  but without going back to mythological times
without dwelling on archytas of tarentum we find
in the works of dante of perugia of leonardo da
vinci and guidotti the idea of machines made to
move through the air two centuries and a half
afterwards inventors began to multiply in 
the marquis de bacqueville designed a system of
wings tried it over the seine and fell and broke his
arm in  paucton conceived the idea of an
apparatus with two screws suspensive and propul-
sive in  meerwein the architect of the prince
of baden built an orthopteric machine and pro-
tested against the tendency of the aerostats which
had just been invented in  launoy and bien-
venu had maneuvered a helicopter worked by springs
in  there were the attempts at flight by the
austrian jacques degen in  came the pamphlet
by deniau of nantes in which the principles of
heavier than air are laid down from  to 
came the inventions and researches of derblinger
vigual sarti dubochet and cagniard de latour
in  we have the englishman henson with his
system of inclined planes and screws worked by
steam in  came cossus and his ascensional
screws in  came camille vert and his helicop-
ter made of birds wings in  came letur with
his system of guidable parachutes whose trial cost
him his life and in the same year came michael
loup with his plan of gliding through the air on
four revolving wings in  came beleguic and
his aeroplane with the traction screws vaussin-
chardannes with his guidable kite and george
cauley with his flying-machines driven by gas from
 to  appeared joseph pline with several
patents for aerial systems breant carlingford le
bris du temple bright whose ascensional screws
were left-handed smythies panafieu crosnier etc
at length in  thanks to the efforts of nadar a
society of heavier than air was founded in paris
there the inventors could experiment with the ma-
chines of which many were patented ponton dame-
court and his steam helicopter la landelle and his

system of combining screws with inclined planes and
parachutes louvrie and his aeroscape esterno and
his mechanical bird groof and his apparatus with
wings worked by levers the impetus was given
inventors invented calculators calculated all that
could render aerial locomotion practicable bourcart

some with wings or screws others with inclined
planes imagined created constructed perfected their
flying machines ready to do their work once there
came to be applied to them by some inventor a motor
of adequate power and excessive lightness

   this list may be a little long but that will be for-
given for it is necessary to give the various steps in
the ladder of aerial locomotion on the top of which
appeared robur the conqueror without these at-
tempts these experiments of his predecessors how
could the inquirer have conceived so perfect an
apparatus and though he had but contempt for
those who obstinately worked away in the direction
of balloons he held in high esteem all those partisans
of heavier than air fnglish american italian
austrian french-and particularly french -whose
work had been perfected by him and led him to
design and then to build this flying machine known as
the albatross which he was guiding through the
currents of the atmosphere

  the pigeon flies had exclaimed one of the
most persistent adepts at aviation

   they will crowd the air as they crowd the earth
said one of his most excited partisans

   from the locomotive to the aeromotive shouted
the noisiest of all who hadnurned on the trumpet of
publicity to awaken the olcr and new worlds

   nothing in fact is better established by experi-
ment and calculation than that the air is highly re-
sistant a circumference of only a yard in diameter
in the shape of a parachute can not only impede
descent in air but can render it isochronous that
is a fact

  it is equally well known that when the speed is
great the work of the weight varies in almost inverse
ratio to the square of the speed and therefore be-
comes almost insignificant

  it is also known that as the weight of a flying
animal increases the less is the proportional increase
in the surface beaten by the wings in order to sus-
tain it although the motion of the wings becomes
slower

  a flying machine must therefore be constructed
to take advantage of these natural laws to imitate
the bird that admirable type of aerial locomotion
according to dr marcy of the institute of france

  in short the contrivances likely to solve the
problem are of three kinds

  	helicopters or spiralifers which are simply
screws with vertical axes

  	orthopters machines which endeavour to re-
produce the natural flight of birds

  	aeroplanes which are merely inclined planes
like kites but towed or driven by screws

  each of these systems has had and still has its
partisans obstinately resolved not to give way in the
slightest particular


amazing stories

however robur for many reasons had re-
jected the two first

  the orthopter or mechanical bird offers certain
advantages no doubt that the work and experi-
ments of m renard in  have sufficiently proved
but as lias been said it is not necessary to copy
nature servilely locomotives are not copied from
the hare nor are ships copied from the fish to the
first we have put wheels which are not legs to the
second we have put screws which are not fins and
they do not do so badly besides what is this me-
chanical movement in the flight of birds whose action
is so complex has not doctor marcy suspected
that the feathers open during the return of the wings
so as to let the air through them and is not that
rather a difficult operation for an artificial machine

  on the other hand aeroplanes have given many
good results screws opposing a slanting plane to
the bed of air will produce an ascensional movement
and the models experimented on have shown that
the disposable weight that is to say the weight it is
possible to deal with as distinct from that of the
apparatus increases with the square of the speed
herein the aeroplane has the advantage over the
aerostat even when the aerostat is furnished with the
means of locomotion

  nevertheless robur had thought that the simpler
his contrivance the better and the screws-the saint
helices that had been thrown in his teeth at the
weldon institute-had sufficed for all the needs of
his flying machine one series could hold it sus-
pended in the air the other could drive it along under
conditions that were marvelously adapted for speed
and safety

  if the orthopter-striking like the wings of a
bird-raised itself by beating the air the helicopter
raised itself by strikingthe air obliquely with the
fins of the screw as it mounted on an inclined plane
these fins or arms are in reality wings but wings
disposed as a helix instead of as a paddle wheel the
helix advances in the direction of its axis is the
axis vertical  then it moves vertically is the axis
horizontal  then it moves horizontally

  the whole of roburs flying apparatus depended
on these two movements as will be seen from the
following detailed description which can be divided
under three heads-the platform the engines of sus-
pension and propulsion and the machinery

  platform-this was a framework a hundred feet
long and twelve wide a ships deck in fact with a
projecting prow beneath was a hull solidly built
enclosing the engines stores and provisions of all
sorts including the water tanks round the deck a
few light uprights supported a wire trellis that did
duty for bulwarks on the dock were three houses
whose compartments were used as cabins for the
crew or as machine-rooms in the center house was
the machine which drove the lifting helices in
that forward was the machine that drove the bow
screw in that aft was the machine that drove the
stern screw in the bow were the cooks galley and
the crews quarters in the stern were several cabins
including that of the engineer the saloon and above
them all a glass house in which stood the helmsman
who steered the vessel by means of a powerful
rudder all these cabins were lighted by port-
holes filled with toughened glass which has ten
times the resistance of ordinary glass beneath this
hull was a system of flexible springs to ease off

the concussion when it became advisable to land

  engines of suspension and propulsion-above the
deck rose thirty-seven vertical axes fifteen along
each side and seven more elevated in the centre
the albatross might be called a clipper with thirty-
seven masts but these masts instead of sails bore
each two horizontal screws not very large in spread
or diameter but driven at prodigious speed each
of these axes had its movement independent of the
rest and each alternate one spun round in a different
direction from the others-so as to avoid any tendency
to gyration hence the screws as they rose on the
vertical column of air retained their equilibrium by
their horizontal resistance consequently the appara-
tus was furnished with seventy-four lifting screws
whose three wings were connected by a metallic circle
which economized their motive force in front and
behind mounted on horizontal axes were two pro-
pelling screws each with four arms these screws
were of much larger diameter than the lifting ones
but could be worked at quite their speed in fact
the vessel combined the system of cossus la lan-
delle and ponton daniecourt as perfected by
robur but it was in the choice and application of
his motive force that he could claim to be an inventor

  machinery-robur had not availed himself of the
vapor of water or other liquids nor compressed air
and other elastic gases nor explosive mixtures cap-
able of producing mechanical motion he employed
electricity that agent which one day will be the soul
of the industrial world but he required no electro-
generator to produce it all he trusted to were bat-
teries and accumulators what were the elements of
these batteries and what were the acids he used
robur only knew and the construction of the accu-
mulators was kept equally secret of what were their
positive and negative plates none could say the
engineer took good care-and not unreasonably-to
keep his secret unpatented one thing was unmistak-
able and that was that the batteries were of extraor-
dinary strength and the accumulators left those of
faure-sellon-volckmar very far behind in yielding
currents whose amperes ran into figures up to then
unknown thus there was obtained a power to drive
the screws and communicate a suspending and pro-
pelling force in excess of all his requirements under
any circumstances

  but-it is as well to repeat it-this belonged en-
tirely to robur he kept it a close secret and if
the president and secretary of the weldon institute
did not happen to discover it it would probably be
lost to humanity

  it need not be shown that the apparatus possessed
sufficient stability its center of gravity proved that
at once there was no danger of its making alarm-
ing angles with the horizontal still less of its cap-
sizing

  and now for the metal used by robur in the con-
struction of his aeronef-a name which can be exact-
ly applied to the albatross what was this material
so hard that the bowie-knife of phil evans could not
scratch it and uncle prudent could not explain its
nature  simply paper

  for some years this fabrication had been making
considerable progress unsized paper with the sheets
impregnated with dextrin and starch and squeezed in
hydraulic presses will form a material hard like steel
there are made of it pulleys rails and wagon-
wheels much more solid than metal wheels and far
robur the conqueror



lighter and it was this lightness and solidity which
robur availed himself of in building his aerial loco-
motive everything-framework hull houses cabins
-were made of straw paper turned hard as metal
by compression and-what was not to be despised in
an apparatus flying at great heights-incombustible
the different parts of the engines and the screws
were made of gelatinized fiber which combined in
sufficient degree flexibility with resistance this ma-
terial could be used in every form it was insoluble
in most gases and liquids acids or essences to say
nothing of its insulating properties and it proved
most valuable in the electric machinery of the alba-
tross

  robur his mate tom turner an engineer and
two assistants two steersmen and a cook-eight men
all told- formed the crew of the aeronef and proved
ample for all the maneuvers required in aerial navi-
gation there were arms of the chase and of war
fishing appliances electric lights instruments of ob-
servation compasses and sextants for checking the
course thermometers for studying the temperature
different barometers some for estimating the heights
attained others for indicating the variations of at-
mospheric pressure a storm-glass for forecasting
tempests a small library a portable printing press
a field-piece mounted on a pivot breech-loading and
throwing a three-inch shell a supply of powder
bullets dynamite cartridges a cooking-stove warmed
by currents from the accumulators a stock of pre-
served meats and vegetables sufficient to last for
months such were the outfit and stores of the
aeronef-in addition to the famous trumpet

  there was besides a light india-rubber boat in-
submersible which could carry eight men on the
surface of a river a lake or a calm sea

  but were there any parachutes in case of accident 
no robur did not believe in accidents of that kind
the axes of the screws were independent the stop-
page of a few would not affect the motion of the
others and if only half were working the albatross
could keep afloat in her natural element

  and with her said robur to his guests-guests
in spite of themselves-i am master of the seventh
part of the world larger than africa oceania asia
the americas and europe this aerial icarian sea
which millions of icarians will one day people

chapter viii
the balloonists refuse to be convinced

the president of the weldon institute was
stupefied his companion was astonished but
neither of them would allow any of their very
natural amazement to be visible

  the valet frycollin did not conceal his terror at
finding himself borne through space on such a ma-
chine and he took no pains whatever to hide it

  the ascensional screws were rapidly spinning over-
head fast as they were going they would have to
triple their speed if the albatross was to ascend to
higher zones the two propellors were running very
easily and driving the ship at about eleven knots an
hour

  as they leaned over the rail the passengers of the
albatross could perceive a long sinuous liquid ribbon
which meandered like a mere brook through a varied
country amid the gleaming of many lagoons obliquely
struck by the rays of the sun the brook was a river

one of the most important in that district along its
left bank was a chain of mountains extending out of
sight

  and will you tell us where we are asked uncle
prudent in a voice tremulous with anger

  i have nothing to teach you answered robur
and will you tell us where we are going  asked
phil evans

  through space

  and how long will that last

  until it ends

  are we going round the world asked phil
evans ironically

  further than that said robur

  and if this voyage does not suit us  asked uncle
prudent

  it will have to suit you

  that is a foretaste of the nature of the relations
that were to obtain between the master of the alba-
tross and his guests not to say his prisoners mani-
festly he wished to give them time to cool down to
admire the marvelous apparatus which was bearing
them through the air and doubtless to compliment
the inventor and so he went off to the other end
of the deck leaving them to examine the arrange-
ment of the machinery and the management of the
ship or to give their whole attention to the land-
scape which was unrolling beneath them

  uncle prudent said evans unless i am mis-
taken we are flying over eastern canada that river
in the northwest is the st lawrence that town we
are leaving behind is quebec

  it was indeed the old city of champlain whose
zinc roofs were shining like reflectors in the sun
the albatross must thus have reached the forty-
sixth degree of north latitude and thus was ex-
plained the premature advance of the day with the
abnormal prolongation of the dawn

  yes said phil evans there is the town in its
amphitheater the hill with its citadel the gibraltar
of north america there are the cathedrals there
is the custom house with its dome surmounted by
the british flag

  phil evans had not finished before the canadian
city began to slip into the distance

  the clipper entered a zone of light clouds which
gradually shut off a view of the ground

  robur seeing that the president and secretary of
the weldon institute had directed their attention to
the external arrangements of the albatross walked
up to them and said

well gentlemen do you believe in the possibility
of aerial locomotion by machines heavier than air
it would have been difficult not to succumb to the
evidence but uncle prudent and phil evans did
not reply

  you are silent continued the engineer doubt-
less hunger makes you dumb but if i undertook to
carry you through the air i did not think of feed-
ing you on such a poorly nutritive fluid your first
breakfast is waiting for you

  as uncle prudent and phil evans were feeling
the pangs of hunger somewhat keenly they did not
care to stand upon ceremony a meal would commit
them to nothing and when robur put them back on
the ground they could resume full liberty of action

  and so they followed into a small dining-room in
the aftermost house there they found a well-laid
table at which they could take their meals during the


amazing stories

voyage there were different preserves and among
other things was a sort of bread made of equal parts
of flour and meat reduced to powder and worked
together with a little lard which boiled in water
made excellent soup and there were fried rashers of
bacon and for drink there was tea

  neither had frycollin been forgotten he was
taken forward and there found some strong soup
made of this bread in truth he had to be very
hungry to eat at all for his jaws shook with fear
and almost refused to work if it was to break-
if it was to break said the unfortunate negro
hence continual faintings only think a fall of
over four thousand feet which would smash him to
a jelly

  an hour afterwards uncle prudent and phil
evans appeared on the deck robur was no longer
there at the stern the man at the wheel in his glass
cage his eyes fixed on the compass followed im-
perturbably without hesitation the route given by the
engineer

  as for the rest of the crew breakfast probably
kept them from their posts an assistant engineer
examining the machinery went from one house to
the other

  if the speed of the ship was great the two col-
leagues could only estimate it imperfectly for the
albatross had passed through the cloud zone which
the sun showed some four thousand feet below

  i can hardly believe it said phil evans

  dont believe it said uncle prudent and
going to the bow they looked out towards the western
horizon

  another town said phil evans

  do you recognize it

  yes  it seems to me to be montreal

  montreal  but we mw left quebec two hours
ago

  that proves that we must be going at a speed of
seventy-five miles an hour

  such was the speed of the aeronef and if the
passengers were not inconvenienced by it it was
because they were going with the wind in a calm
such speed would have been difficult and the rate
would have sunk to that of an express in a head-
wind the speed would have been impossible

  phil evans was not mistaken below the albatross
appeared montreal easily recognizable by the vic-
toria bridge a tubular bridge thrown over the st
lawrence like the railway viaduct over the venice
lagoon soon they could distinguish the towns wide
streets its huge shops its palatial banks its cathe-
dral recently built on the model of st peters at
rome and then mount royal which commands the
city and forms a magnificent park

  luckily phil evans had visited the chief towns of
canada and could recognize them without asking
robur after montreal they passed ottawa whose
falls seen from above looked like a vast cauldron in
ebullition throwing off masses of steam with grand
effect

  there is the parliament house

  and he pointed out a sort of nuremburg toy
planted on a hill top this story with its polychrome
architecture resembled the house of parliament in
london much as the montreal cathedral resembles
st peters at rome but that was of no conse-
quence  there could be no doubt it was ottawa

  soon the city faded off towards the horizon and
formed but a luminous spot on the ground

it was almost two hours before robur appeared
his mate tom turner accompanied him he
said only three words these were transmitted to
the two assistant engineers in the fore and aft engine-
houses at a sign the helmsman changed the direc-
tion of the albatross a couple of points to the south-
west at the same time uncle prudent and phil
evans felt that a greater speed had been given to the
propellers

  in fact the speed had been doubled and now sur-
passed anything that had ever been attained by ter-
restrial engines torpedo boats do their twenty-two
knots an hour railway trains do their sixty miles an
hour the ice boats on the frozen hudson do their
sixty-five miles an hour a machine built by the pat-
terson company with a cogged wheel has done its
eighty miles and another locomotive between tren-
ton and jersey city has done its eighty-four

  but the albatross at full speed could do her hun-
dred and twenty miles an hour or  feet per
second this speed is that of the storm which tears
up trees by the roots it is the mean speed of the
carrier pigeon and is only surpassed by the flight of
the swallow  feet per second and that of the
swift  feet per second

  in a word as robur had said the albatross by
using the whole force of her screws could make the
tour of the globe in two hundred hours or less than
eight days

  is it necessary to say so  the phenomenon whose
appearance had so much puzzled the people of both
worlds was the aeronef of the engineer the trum-
pet which blared its startling fanfares through the air
was that of the mate tom turner the flag planted
on the chief monuments of europe asia america
was the flag of robur the conqueror and his alba-

  and if up to then the engineer had taken many
precautions against being recognized if by prefer-
ence he traveled at night clearing the way with his
electric lights and during the day vanishing into the
zones above the clouds he seemed now to have no
wish to keep his secret hidden and if he had come
to philadelphia and presented himself at the meeting
of the weldon institute was it not that they might
share in his prodigious discovery and that he might
convince ipso facto the most incredulous we know
how he had been received and we see what reprisals
he had taken on the president and secretary of the
club

  again did robur approach his prisoners who
affected to be in no way surprised at what they saw
of what had succeeded in spite of them evidently
beneath the cranium of these two anglo-saxon heads
there was a thick crust of obstinacy which would
not be easy to remove

  on his part robur did not seem to notice anything
particular and coolly continued the conversation
which he had begun two hours before

  gentlemen said he you ask yourselves doubt-
less if this apparatus so marvelously adapted for
aerial locomotion is susceptible to receiving greater
speed it is not worth while to conquer space if we
cannot devour it i wanted the air to be a solid sup-
port to me and it is i saw that to struggle against
the wind i must be stronger than the wind and i am
robur the conqueror



i had no need of sails to drive me nor oars nor
wheels to push me nor rails to give me a faster road
air is what i panted that was all air surrounds
me as water surrounds the submarine boat and in it
my propellers act like the screws of a steamer that
is how i solved the problem of aviation that is what
a balloon will never do nor will any machine that is
lighter than air

   silence absolute on the part of the colleagues
which did not for a moment disconcert the engineer
he contented himself with a half-smile and con-
tinued in his interrogative style perhaps you ask if
to this power of the albatross to move horizontally
there is added an equal power of vertical move-
ment-in a word if when we visit the higher zones
of the atmosphere we can compete with an aerostat
well i should not advise you to enter the go-ahead
against her

   the two colleagues shrugged their shoulders that
was probably what the engineer was waiting for

  robur made a sign the propelling screws imme-
diately stopped and after running for a mile the
albatross pulled up motionless

  at a second gesture from robur the ascensional
helices revolved at a speed that can only be compared
to that of a siren in acoustical experiments their
f-r-r-r-r rose nearly an octave in the scale of sound
diminishing gradually in intensity as the air became
more rarefied and the machine rose vertically like a
lark singing his song in space

  master master shouted frycollin see that
it doesnt break

  a smile of disdain was roburs only reply in a
few minutes the albatross had attained the height of
 feet and extended the range of vision by sev-
enty miles the barometer having fallen  milli-
meters

  then the albatross descended the diminution of
the pressure in high altitudes leads to the diminution
of oxygen in the air and consequently in the blood
this has been the cause of several serious accidents
which have happened to aeronauts and robur saw
no reason to run any risk

  the albatross thus returned to the height she
seemed to prefer and her propellers beginning again
drove her off to the southwest

  now sirs if that is what you wanted you can
reply

   then leaning over the rail he remained absorbed
in contemplation

  when he raised his head the president and secre-
tary of the weldon institute stood by his side

  engineer robur said uncle prudent in vain
endeavoring to control himself we have nothing to
ask alxuit what you seem to believe but we wish
to ask you a question which we think you would do
well to answer

  speak

  by what right did you attack us in philadelphia
in fairmount park by what right did you shut us
up in that prison  by what right have you brought
us against our will on board this flying machine 
and by what right messieurs balloonists did
you insult and threaten me in your club in such a way
that i am astonished i came out of it alive

   to ask is not to answer said phil evans and
i repeat by what right

  do you wish to know

   if you please

  well then by the right of the strongest

  that is cynical

  but it is true

  and for how long citizen engineer asked uncle
prudent who was nearly exploding for how long
do you intend to exercise that right

  how can you said robur ironically how can
you ask me such a question when you have only to
cast down your eyes to enjoy a spectacle unparalleled
in the world

  the albatross was then sweeping across the im-
mense expanse of lake ontario she had just
crossed the country so poetically described by cooper
then she followed the southern shore and headed for
the celebrated river which pours into it the waters
of lake erie breaking them to powder in its cat-
aracts

  in an instant a majestic sound a roar as of the
tempest mounted towards them and as if a humid
fog had been projected into the air the atmosphere
sensibly freshened

  below were the liquid masses they seemed like
an enormous flowing sheet of crystal amid a thou-
sand rainbows due to refraction as it decomposed the
solar rays the sight was sublime

  before the falls a bridge stretching like a thread
united one bank to the other three miles below was
a suspension-bridge across which a train was crawl-
ing from the canadian to the american bank

  the falls of niagara exclaimed phil evans
and as the exclamation escaped him uncle prudent
was doing all he could to admire nothing of these
wonders

  a minute afterwards the albatross had crossed the
river which separates the united states from canada
and was flying over the vast rritories of the west

chapter ix

across the prairie

in one of the cabins of the after-house uncle
prudent and phil evans had found two excel-
lent berths with clean linen change of clothes
and traveling-cloaks and rugs no atlantic liner
could have offered them more comfort if they did
not sleep soundly it was that they did not wish to
do so or rather that their very real anxiety pre-
vented them in what adventure had they embarked 
to what series of experiments had they been in-
vited how would the business end and above
all what was robur going to do with them

  frycollin the valet was quartered forward in a
cabin adjoining that of the cook the neighborhood
did not displease him he liked to rub shoulders with
the great in this world but if he finally went to sleep
it was to dream of fall after fall of projections
through space which made his sleep a horrible night-
mare

  however nothing could be quieter than this jour-
ney through the atmosphere whose currents had
grown weaker with the evening beyond the rustling
of the blades of the screws there was not a sound
except now and then the whistle from some terres-
trial locomotive or the calling of some animal
strange instinct these terrestrial beings felt the
aeronef glide over them and uttered cries of terror
as it assed on the morrow the th of june at
five oclock uncle prudent and phil evans were


amazing stories

walking on the deck of the albatross nothing had 
changed since the evening there was a look-out
forward and the helmsman was in his glass cage

  why was there a look-out was there any chance
of collision with another such machine certainly
not robur had not yet found imitators the chance
of encountering an aerostat gliding through the air
was too remote to be regarded in any case it would
be all the worse for the aerostat-the earthen pot
and the iron pot the albatross had nothing to fear
from the collision

  but what could happen  the aeronef might find
herself like a ship on a lee shore if a mountain that
could not be outflanked or passed barred the way
these are the reefs of the air and they have to be
avoided as a ship avoids the reefs of the sea the
engineer it is true had given the course and in
doing so had taken into account the altitude neces-
sary to clear the summits of the high lands in the
district but as the aeronef was rapidly nearing a
mountainous country it was only prudent to keep a
good lookout in case some slight deviation from the
course became necessary

  looking at the country beneath them uncle pru-
dent and phil evans noticed a large lake whose
lower southern end the albatross had just reached
they concluded therefore that during the night the
whole length of erie had been traversed and that
as they were going due west they would soon be over
lake michigan there can be no doubt of it said
phi evans and that group of roofs on the horizon
is chicago

  he was right it was indeed the city from which
the seventeen railways diverge the queen of the
west the vast reservoir into which flow the products
of indiana ohio wionsin missouri and all the
states which form the western half of the union

  uncle prudent through an excellent telescope he
had found in his cabin easily recognized the prin-
cipal buildings his colleague pointed out to him the
churches and public edifices the numerous eleva-
tors or mechanical granaries and the huge sherman
hotel whose windows seemed like a hundred glitter-
ing points on each of its faces

  if that is chicago said uncle prudent it is
obvious that we are going farther west than is con-
venient for us if we are to return to our starting
place

  and in fact the albatross was traveling in a
straight line from the pennsylvania capital

  but if uncle prudent wished to ask robur to take
him eastwards lie could not then do so that morn-
ing the engineer did not leave his cabin either he
was occupied in some work or else he was asleep
and the two colleagues sat down to breakfast without
seeing him

  the speed was the same as that during last eve-
ning the wind being easterly the rate was not in-
terfered with at all and as the thermometer only
falls a degree centigrade for every seventy meters of
elevation the temperature was not insupportable and
so in chatting and thinking and waiting for the engi-
neer uncle prudent and phil evans walked about
beneath the forest of screws whose gyratory move-
ment gave their arms the appearance of semi-diaph-
anous disks

  the state of illinois was left by its northern fron-
tier in less than two hours and a half and they
crossed the father of waters the mississippi whose

double-decked steamboats seemed no bigger than
canoes then the albatross flew over iowa after
having sighted iowa city about eleven oclock in the
morning

  a few chains of hills bluffs as they are called
curved across the face of the country trending from
the south to the northwest whose moderate height
necessitated no rise in the course of the aeronef
soon the bluffs gave place to the large plains of
western iowa and nebraska-immense prairies ex-
tending all the way to the foot of the rocky moun-
tains here and there were many rios affluents or
minor affluents of the missouri on their banks were
towns and villages growing more scattered as the
albatross sped farther west

  nothing particular happened during this day
uncle prudent and phil evans were left entirely to
themselves they hardly noticed frycollin sprawling
at full length in the how keeping his eyes shut so
that he could see nothing and they were not at-
tacked by vertigo as might have been expected
there was no guiding mark and there was nothing
to cause the vertigo as there would have been on
the top of a lofty building the abyss has no attrac-
tive power when it is gazed at from the car of a
balloon or deck of an aeronef it is not an abyss
that opens beneath the aeronaut but an horizon that
rises round him on all sides like a cup

  in a couple of hours the albatross was over
omaha on the nebraskan frontier-omaha city
the real head of the pacific railway that long line
of rails four thousand five hundred miles in length
stretching from new york to san francisco for
a moment they could see the yellow waters of the
missouri then the town with its houses of wood and
brick in the center of a rich basin like a buckle in
the iron belt which clasps north america round the
waist doubtless also as the passengers in the aero-
nef could observe all the details the inhabitants of
omaha noticed the strange machine their astonish-
ment at seeing it gliding overhead could be no greater
than that of the president and secretary of the wel-
don institute at finding themselves on board

  anyhow the journals of the union would be cer-
tain to notice the fact it would be the explanation
of the astonishing phenomenon which the whole
world had been wondering over for some time

  in an hour the albatross had left omaha and
crossed the platte river whose valley is followed by
the pacific railway in its route across the prairie
things looked serious for uncle prudent and phil
evans

  it is real then this absurd project of taking us to
the antipodes

  and whether we like it or not exclaimed the
other robur had better take care i am not the
man to stand that sort of thing

  nor am i replied phil evans but be calm
uncle prudent be calm

  be calm

  and keep your temper until it is wanted

  by five oclock they had crossed the eastern coun-
tries covered witli pines and poplars and the alba-
tross was over the appropriately named bad lands
of nebraska-a chaos of ochre-colored hills of
mountainous fragments fallen on the soil and broken
in their fall at a distance these blocks take the most
fantastic shapes here and there amid this enormous
game of knucklebones there could be traced the
robur the conqueror



imaginary ruins of mediaeval cities with forts and
dungeons pepper-box turrets and machicolated
towers and in truth these bad lands are an im-
mense ossuary where lie bleaching in the sun myriads
of fragments of pachyderms chelonians and even
some would have us believe fossil men overwhelmed
by unknown cataclysms ages and ages ago

when evening came the whole basin of the
platte river had been crossed and the plain
extended to the extreme limits of the horizon which
rose high owing to the altitude of the albatross

  during the night there were no more shrill whistles
of locomotives or deeper notes of the river steamers
to trouble the quiet of the starry firmament long
bellowings occasionally reached the aeronef from the
herds of buffalo that roamed over the prairie in
search of water and pasturage and when they
ccased the trampling of the grass under their feet
produced a dull roaring similar to the rushing of a
flood and very different from the continuous f-r-r-r-r
of the screws

  then from time to time came the howl of a wolf
a fox a wild cat or a coyote the canis latrans
whose name is justified by his sonorous bark

  occasionally came penetrating odors of mint and
sage and absinthe mingled with the more powerful
fragrance of the conifers which rose floating
through the night air

  at last came a menacing yell which was not due
to the coyote it was the shout of a redskin which
no tenderfoot would confound with the cry of a
wild beast

westward-but whither

the next day the th of june about five
oclock in the morning phil evans left his
cabin perhaps he would today have a chance
of speaking to robur desirous of knowing why he
had not appeared the day before evans addressed
himself to the mate tom turner

  tom turner was an englishman of about forty-
five broad in the shoulders and short in the legs a
man of iron with one of those enormous character-
istic heads that hogarth rejoiced in

  shall we see mr robur today asked phil
evans

  i dont know said turner

  i need not ask if he had gone out

  perhaps he has

  and when will he come back

  when he has finished his cruise

  and tom went into his cabin

  with this reply they had to be contented matters
did not look promising particularly as on reference
to the compass it appeared that tiie albatross was
still steering south-west

  great was the contrast between the barren tract
of the bad lands passed over during the night and
the landscape then unrolling beneath them

  the aeronef was now more than six hundred miles
from omaha and over a country which phil evans
could not recognize because he had never been there
before a few forts to keep the indians in order
crowned the bluffs with their geometric lines formed
oftener of palisades than walls there were few

villages and few inhabitants the country differing
widely from the auriferous lands of colorado many
leagues to the south

  in the distance a long line of mountain crests in
great confusion as yet began to appear they were
the rocky mountains

  for the first time that morning uncle prudent and
phil evans were sensible of a certain iowness of
temperature which was not due to a change in the
weather for the sun shone in superb splendor

  it is because of the albatross being higher in the
air said phil evans

  in fact the barometer outside the central deck-
house had fallen  millimeters thus indicating an
elevation of about  feet above the sea the
aeronef was at this altitude owing to the elevation of
the ground an hour before she had been at a height
of  feet and behind her were mountains cov-
ered with perpetual snow

  there was nothing uncle prudent and his com-
panion could remember which would lead them to
discover where they were during the night the
albatross had made several stretches north and south
at tremendous speed and that was what had put
them out of their reckoning

  after talking over several hypotheses more or less
plausible they came to the conclusion that this coun-
try encircled with mountains must be the district
declared by an act of congress in march  to
be the national park of the united states a strange
region it was it well merited the name of a park-
a park with mountains for hills with lakes for ponds
with rivers for streamlets and with geysers of mar-
velous power instead of fountains

  in a few minutes the albatross glided across the
yellowstone river leaving mount stevenson on the
right and coasting the largt lake which bears the
name of the stream great was the variety on the
banks of this basin ribbed as they were with obsidian
and tiny crystals reflecting the sunlight on their
myriad facets wonderful was the arrangement of
the islands on its surface magnificent were the blue
reflections of the gigantic mirror and around the
lake one of the highest in the globe were multitudes
of pelicans swans gulls and bernicle geese and
divers in places the steep banks were clothed with
green trees pines and larches and at the foot of the
escarpments there shot upwards innumerable white
fumaroles the vapor escaping from the soil as from
an enormous reservoir in which the water is kept in
permanent ebullition by subterranean fire

the cook might have seized the opportunity of
securing an ample supply of trout the only fish
the yellowstone lake contains in myriads but the
albatross kept on at such a height that there was no
chance of indulging in a catch which assuredly would
have been miraculous

  in three quarters of an hour the lake was passed
over and a little farther on the last was seen of the
geyser region which rivals the finest in iceland
leaning over the rail uncle prudent and phil evans
watched the liquid columns which leaped up as
though to furnish the aeronef with a new element
there were the fan with the jets shot forth in rays
the fortress which seemed to be defended by water-
spouts old faithful with her plume crowned with
the rainbows the giant spurting forth a vertical


amazing stories

torrent twenty feet round and more than two hun-
dred feet high

  robur must evidently have been familiar with this
incomparable spectacle unique in the world for he
did not appear on deck was it then for the sole
pleasure of his guests that he had brought the aero-
nef above the national domain if so he came not
to receive their thanks he did not even trouble
himself during the passage of the rocky mountains
which the albatross approached at about seven
oclock

  by increasing the speed of her wings as a bird
rising in its flight the albatross would clear the
highest ridges of the chain and sink again over
oregon or utah but the maneuver was unnecessary
the passes allowed the barrier to be crossed without
ascending for the higher ridges there are many of
these canyons or steep valleys more or less narrow
through which they could glide such as bridger
canyon through which runs the pacific railway into
the mormon territory and others to the north and
south of it

  it was through one of these that the albatross
headed after slackening speed so as not to dash
against the walls of the canyon the steersman with
a sureness of hand rendered more effective by the
sensitiveness of the rudder maneuvered his craft as
if she were a crack racer in a royal victoria yacht
race it was really extraordinary in spite of all the
jealousy of the two advocates of lighter than air
they could not help being surprised at the perfection
of this engine of aerial locomotion

  in less than two hours and a half they were
through the rockies and the albatross had resumed
her former speed of sixty-two miles an hour she
was steering southwestso as to cut across utah
diagonally as she neared the ground she had even
dropped several hundred yards when the sound of a
whistle attracted the attention of uncle prudent and
phil evans	

  it was a train on the pacific railway on the road
to salt lake city

  and then in obedience to an order secretly given
the albatross dropped still lower so as to chase the
train which was going at full speed she was imme-
diately sighted a few heads showed themselves at
the doors of the cars then numerous passengers
crowded the gangways some did not hesitate to
climb on the roof to get a better view of the flying
machine cheers came floating up through the air
but no robur appeared in answer to them

  the albatross continued her descent slowing her
elevating screws and moderating her speed so as not
to leave the train behind she flew about it like an
enormous beetle or a gigantic bird of prey she
headed off to the right and left and swept on in
front and hung behind and proudly displayed her
flag with the golden sun to which the conductor of
the train replied by waving the stars and stripes

   in vain the prisoners in their desire to take advan-
tage of the opportunity endeavored to make them-
selves known to those below in vain the president
of the weldon institute roared forth at the top of
his voice i am uncle prudent of philadelphia
and the secretary followed suit with i am phil
evans his colleague their shouts were lost in the
thousand cheers with which the passengers greeted
the aeronef

  three or four of the crew of the albatross had ap-

peared on the deck and one of them like sailors
when passing a ship less speedy than their own held
out a rope an ironical way of offering to tow them

  and then the albatross resumed her original speed
and in half an hour the express was out of sight
about one oclock there appeared a vast disk which
reflected the solar rays as if it were an immense
mirror

  that ought to be the mormon capital salt lake
city said uncle prudent and so it was and the
disk was the roof of the tabernacle where ten thou-
sand saints can worship at their ease this vast
dome like a convex mirror threw off the rays of the
sun in all directions

  it vanished like a shadow and the albatross sped
on her way to the southwest with a speed that was
not felt as it surpassed that of the chasing wind
soon she was in nevada over the silver regions
which the sierra separates from the golden lands of
california

  we shall certainly reach san francisco before
night said phil evans

  and then asked uncle prudent

  it was six oclock precisely when the sierra
nevada was crossed by the same pass as that taken
by the railway only a hundred and eighty miles
then separated them from san francisco the cali-
fornian capital

  at the speed the albatross was going she would be
over the city by eight oclock

  at this moment robur appeared on deck the
colleagues walked up to him

  engineer robur said uncle prudent  we are
now on the confines of america we think the time
has come for this joke to end

  i never joke said robur

  he raised his hand the albatross swiftly dropped
towards the ground and at the same time such speed
was given her as to drive the prisoners into their
cabin

  as soon as the door was shut uncle prudent
exclaimed i could strangle him

  we must try to escape said phil evans

  yes cost what it may

  a long murmur greeted their ears it was the
beating of the surf on the seashore it was the
pacific ocean

chapter xi

the wide pacific

uncle prudent and phil evans had quite
made up their minds to escape if they had

	not had to deal with the eight particularly
vigorous men who composed the crew of the aeronef
they might have tried to succeed by main force but
as they were only two-for frycollin could only be
considered as a quantity of no importance-force
was not to be thought of hence recourse must be
had to strategy as soon as the albatross again took
the ground such was what phil evans endeavored
to impress on his irascible colleague though he was
in constant fear of prudent aggravating matters by
some premature outbreak

  in any case the present was not the time to attempt
anything of the sort the aeronef was sweeping along
over the north pacific on the following morning
that of june th the coast was out of sight and as
robur the conqueror



the coast curves off from vancouver island up to
the aleutians--belonging to that portion of america
ceded by russia to the united states in -it was
highly probable that the albatross would cross it at
the end of the curve if her course remained un-
changed

  iiow long the night appeared to be to the two
friends how eager they were to get out of their
cabins when they came on deck in the morning the
dawn had for some hours been silvering the eastern
horizon they were nearing the june solstice the
longest day of the year in the northern hemisphere
when there is hardly any night along the sixtieth
parallel

  either from custom or intention robur was in
no hurry to leave his deck-house when he came out
this morning he contented himself with bowing to
his two guests as lie passed them in the stern of the

aeronef

  and now frycollin ventured out of his cabin his
eyes red with sleeplessness and dazed in their look
he tottered along like a man whose foot feels it is
not on solid ground his first glance was at the ele-
vating screws which were working with gratifying
regularity without any signs of haste

  that done the negro stumbled along to the rail
and grasped it with both hands so as to make sure
of his balance evidently he wished to view the
country over which the albatross was flying at the
height of seven hundred feet or more

  at first he kept himself well back behind the rail
then he shook it to make sure it was firm then he
drew himself up then he bent forward then he
stretched out his head it need not be said that while
he was executing these different maneuvers he kept
his eyes shut at last he opened them

  what a shout and how quickly he fled and
how deeply his head sank back into his shoulders
at the bottom of the abyss he had seen the immense
ocean his hair would have risen on end-if it had
not been wool

  the sea  the sea  he cried and frycollin would
have fallen on the deck had not the cook opened his
arms to receive him

  this cook was a frenchman and probably a
gascon his name being francois tapage if he
was not a gascon he must in his infancy have inhaled
the breezes of the garonne how did this franqois
tapage find himself in the service of the engineer
by what chain of accidents had he become one of the
crew of the albatross we can hardly say but in
any case he spoke english like a yankee eh
stand up said he lifting the negro by a vigorous
clutch at the waist

  master tapage said the poor fellow giving a
despairing look at the screws

  at your service frycollin

  did this thing ever smash

  no but it will end by smashing

 why why 

  because everything must end

  and the sea is beneath us

  if we are to fall it is better to fall in the sea
  we shall be drowned

  we shall be drowned but we shall not be smashed
to a jelly

  the next moment frycollin was on all fours
creeping to the back of his cabin

  during this day the aeronef was only driven at

moderate speed she seemed to skim the placid
surface of the sea which lay glistening in the sun-
shine about a hundred feet beneath uncle prudent
and his companion remained in their cabin so that
they did not meet with robur who walked about
smoking alone or talking to the mate only half the
screws were working yet that was enough to keep
the apparatus afloat in the lower zones of the atmos-
phere

  the crew as a change from the ordinary routine
would have endeavored to catch a few fish had there
been any sign of them but all that could be seen on
the surface of the sea were a few of those yellow-
bellied whales which measure about eighty feet in
length these are the most formidable cetaceans in
the northern seas and whalers are very careful in
attacking them for their strength is prodigious
however in harpooning one of these whales cither
with the ordinary harpoon the fletcher fuse or the
javelin-bomb of which there was an assortment on
board there would have been no danger to the men
of the albatross

  but what was the good of such useless massacre
doubtless to show off the powers of the aeronef
to the members of the weldon institute and so
robur gave orders for the capture of one of these
monstrous cetaceans

  at the shout of a whale a whale uncle prudent
and phil evans came out of their cabin perhaps
there was a whaler in sight in that case all they had
to do to escape from their flying prison was to jump
into the sea and chance being picked up by the
vessel

  the crew were all on deck shall we try sir
asked tom turner

  yes said robur

  in the engine-room the engineer and his assistant
were at their posts ready to obey the orders signaled
to them the albatross dropped towards the sea
and remained about fifty feet above it

  there was no ship in sight-of that the two col-
leagues soon assured themselves-nor was there any
land to be seen to which they could swim providing
robur made no attempt to recapture them

  several jets of water from the spout holes soon
announced the presence of the whales as they came to
the surface to breathe tom turner and one of the
men were in the bow within his reach was one of
those javelin-bombs of california make which are
shot from an arquebus and which are shaped like
a metallic cylinder terminated by a cylindrical bomb
armed with a shaft having a barbed point robur
was a little farther aft and with his right hand sig-
naled to the engineers while with his left he directed
the steersman he thus controlled the aeronef in
every way horizontally and vertically and it is al-
most impossible to conceive with what speed and pre-
cision the albatross answered to his orders she
seemed a living being of which he was the soul

  a whale a whale shouted tom turner as the
back of a cetacean emerged from the surface about
four cable-lengths in front of the albatross

  the albatross swept towards it and when she was
within sixty feet of it she stopped dead

  tom turner seized the arquebus which was rest-
ing against a cleat on the rail he fired and the
projectile attached to a long line entered the whales
body the bomb filled with an explosive compound


amazing stories

burst and shot out a small harpoon with two
branches which fastened into the animals flesh

  look out shouted turner

  uncle prudent and phil evans much against their
will became greatly interested in the spectacle

  the whale seriously wounded gave the sea such
a slap with his tail that the water dashed up over the
bow of the aeronef then he plunged to great depth
while the line which had been previously wetted in
a tub of water to prevent its taking fire ran out
like lightning when the whale rose to the surface
he started off at full speed in a northerly direction

  it may be imagined with what speed the albatross
was towed in pursuit besides the propellers had
been stopped the whale was let go as he would
and the ship followed him turner stood ready to
cut the line in case a fresh plunge should render this
towing dangerous

  for half an hour and perhaps for a distance of
six miles the albatross was thus dragged along but
it was obvious that the whale was tiring then at
a gesture from robur the assistant engineers started
the propellers astern so as to oppose a certain re-
sistance to the whale who was gradually getting
closer

  soon the aeronef was gliding about twenty-five
feet above him his tail was beating the waters with
incredible violence and as he turned over on his back
an enormous wave was produced

suddenly the whale turned up again so as to
take a header as it were and then dived with
such rapidity that turner had barely time to cut the
line

  the aeronef was dragged to the very surface of
the water a whirlpool ws formed where the ani-
mal had disappeared a wave dashed up on to the
deck as if the aeronef were a ship driving against
the wind and tide

   luckily with a blow of the hatchet the mate sev-
ered the line and the albatross freed from her tug
sprang aloft six hundred feet under the impulse of
her ascensional screws robur had maneuvered his
ship without losing his coolness for a moment

  a few minutes afterwards the whale returned to
the surface-dead from every side the birds flew
down on to the carcass and their cries were enough
to deafen a congress the albatross without stop-
ping to share in the spoil resumed her course to the
west

  in the morning of the th of june at about six
oclock land was sighted on the horizon this was
the peninsula of alaska and the long range of break-
ers of the aleutian islands

  the albatross glided over the barrier where the
 fur seals swarm for the benefit of the russo-ameri-
can company an excellent business is the capture
of these amphibians which are from six to seven feet
long russet in color and weigh from three hundred
to four hundred pounds there they were in inter-
minable files ranged in line of battle and countable
by thousands

  although they did not move at the passage of the
albatross it was otherwise with the ducks divers
and loons whose husky cries filled the air as they
disappeared beneath the waves and fled terrified from
the aerial monster

  the twelve hundred miles of the behring sea be-
tween the first of the aleutians and the extreme end

of kamtschatka were traversed during the twenty-
four hours of this day and the following night
uncle prudent and phil evans found that there was
no present chance of putting their project of escape
into execution flight was not to be thought of
among the deserts of eastern asia nor on the coast
of the sea of okhotsk evidently the albatross was
bound for japan or china and there although it
was not perhaps quite safe to trust themselves to the
mercies of the chinese or japanese the two friends
had made up their minds to run if the aeronef
stopped

  but would she stop she was not like a bird
which grows fatigued by too long a flight or like a
balloon which has to descend for want of gas she
still had food for many weeks and her organs were
of marvelous strength defying all weakness and
weariness

  during the th of june she swept over the penin-
sula of kamtschatka and during the day there was a
glimpse of petropaulovski and the volcano of klout-
schew then she rose again to cross the sea of
okhotsk running down by the kurile isles which
seemed to be a breakwater pierced by hundreds of
channels on the th in the morning the alba-
tross was over the strait of la perouse between
saghalien and northern japan and had reached the
mouth of the great siberian river the amoor

  then there came on a fog so dense that the aeronef
had to rise above it at the altitude she was there
was no obstacle to be feared no elevated monuments
to hinder her passage no mountains against which
there was risk of being shattered in her flight the
country was only slightly varied but the fog was
very disagreeable and made everything on board
very damp

  all that was necessary was to get above this bed
of mist which was nearly thirteen hundred feet thick
and the ascensional screws being increased in speed
the albatross was soon clear of the fog and in the
sunny regions of the sky under these circum-
stances uncle prudent and phil evans would have
found some difficulty in carrying out their plan of
escape even admitting that they could leave the
aeronef

  during the day as robur passed them he stopped
for a moment and without seeming to attach any
importance to what he said addressed them carelessly
as follows gentlemen a sailing-ship or a steam-
ship caught in a fog from which it cannot escape is
always much delayed it must not move unless it
keeps its whistle or its horn going it must reduce
its speed and any instant a collision may be expected
the albatross has none of these things to fear
what does fog matter to her she can leave it
when she chooses the whole of space is hers
and robur continued his stroll without waiting for
an answer and the puffs of his pipe were lost in the
sky

  uncle prudent said phil evans it seems that
this astonishing albatross never has anything to
fear

  that we shall see answered the president of
the weldon institute

  the fog lasted three days the th th and st
of june with regrettable persistence an ascent had
to be made to clear the japanese mountain of fusi-
yama when the curtain of mist was drawn aside
there lay below them an immense city with palaces
robur the conqueror



villas gardens and parks even without seeing it
robur had recognized it by the barking of the in-
numerable dogs cries of the birds of prey and above
all by the cadaverous odor which the bodies of its
executed criminals gave off into space

  the two colleagues were out on the deck while
the engineer was taking his observations in case he
thought it best to continue his course through the fog

  gentlemen said he i have no reason for con-
cealing from you that this town is tokio the capital
of japan

  uncle prudent did not reply in the presence of
the engineer he was almost choked his lungs were
short of air

  this view of tokio continued robur is very
curious

  curious as it may be- replied phil evans

  it is not as good as pekin interrupted the
engineer that is what i think and very shortly
you shall have an opportunity of judging

  impossible to be more agreeable

  the albatross then gliding southeast had her
course changed four points so as to head to the
eastward

chapter xii
through the himalayas

during the night the fog cleared off there
were symptoms of an approaching typhoon
-a rapid fall of the barometer a disap-
pearance of vapor large clouds of ellipsoid form
clinging to a copper sky and on the opposite hori-
zon long streaks of carmine on a slate-colored field
with a large sector quite clear in the north then the
sea was smooth and calm and at sunset assumed a
deep scarlet hue

  fortunately the typhoon broke more to the south
and had no other result than to sweep away the mist
which had been accumulating during the last three
days

  in an hour they had traversed the hundred and
twenty-five miles of the corean strait and while the
typhoon was raging on the coast of china the alba-
tross was over the yellow sea during the nd
and rd she was over the gulf of pechelee and on
the th she was ascending the valley of the peiho
on her way to the capital of the celestial empire

  leaning over the rail the two colleagues as the
engineer had told them could see distinctly the im-
mense city the wall which divides it into two parts
-the manchoo town and the chinese town-the
twelve suburbs which surround it the large boule-
vards which radiate from its center the temples with
their green and yellow roofs bathed in the rising sun
the grounds surrounding the houses of the man-
darins then in the middle of the manchoo town the
eighteen hundred acres of the yellow town with its
pagodas its imperial gardens its artificial lakes its
mountain of coal which towers above the capital
and in the center of the yellow town like a square
of a chinese puzzle enclosed in another the red
town that is the imperial palace with all the peaks
of its outrageous architecture

  below the albatross the air was filled with a singu-
lar harmony it seemed to be a concert of teolian
harps in the air were a hundred kites of different
forms made of sheets of palm-leaf and having at
their upper end a sort of bow of light wood with
a thin slip of bamboo beneath in the breath of the

wind these slips with all their notes varied like those
of a harmonicon gave forth a most melancholy mur-
muring it seemed as though they were breathing
musical oxygen

  it suited roburs whim to run close up to this
aerial orchestra and the albatross slowed as she
glided through the musical waves which the kites
gave off through the atmosphere

  but immediately an extraordinary effect was pro-
duced amongst the innumerable population beat-
ings of the tomtoms and sounds of other formidable
instruments of the chinese orchestra gun reports by
the thousand mortars fired in hundreds all were
brought into play to scare away the aeronef al-
though the chinese astronomers may have recognized
the aerial machine as the moving body that had given
rise to such disputes it was to the celestial million
from the humblest tankader to the best-buttoned
mandarin an apocalyptical monster appearing in the
sky of buddha

  the crew of the albatross troubled themselves
very little about these demonstrations but the
strings which held the kites and were tied to fixed
pegs in the imperial gardens were cut or quickly
hauled in and the kites were either drawn in rapidly
sounding louder as they sank or else fell like a bird
shot through both wings whose song ends with its
last sigh

  a noisy fanfare escaped from tom turners trum-
pet and drowned the final notes of the aerial con-
cert it did not interrupt the terrestrial fusillade
at last a shell exploded a few feet below the alba-
tross and then she mounted into the inaccessible
regions of the sky

  nothing happened during the few following days
of which the prisoners cod take advantage the
aeronef kept on her course to the southwest thereby
showing that it was intended to take her to india
twelve hours after leaving pekin uncle prudent
and phil evans caught a glimpse of the gerat wall
in the neighborhood of chen-si then avoiding the
lung mountains they passed over the valley of the
hoangho and crossed the chinese border on the
thibet side

  thibet consists of high table-lands without vege-
tation with here and there snowy peaks and barren
ravines torrents fed by glaciers depressions with
glittering beds of salt lakes surrounded by luxurious
forests with icy winds sweeping over all

  the barometer indicated an altitude of thirteen
thousand feet above the level of the sea at that
height the temperature although it was in the warm-
est months of the northern hemisphere was only a
little above freezing this cold combined with the
speed of the albatross made the voyage somewhat
trying and although the friends had warm traveling
wraps they preferred to keep to their cabin

  it need hardly be said that to keep the aeronef
in this rarefied atmosphere the ascension screws
had to be driven at extreme speed but they worked
with perfect regularity and the sound of their wings
almost acted as a lullaby

  during this day appearing from below about the
size of a carrier pigeon she passed over garlock a
town of western thibet the capital of the province
of gari khorsum

on the th of june uncle prudent and phil
evans sighted an enormous barrier broken here and
continued on page

author of the time machine a story of the stone age etc

the country of the blind



hree hundred miles and more from
chimborazo one hundred from snows
of cotopaxi in the wildest wastes of
ecuadors andes there lies that mys-
terious mountain valley cut off from the
world of men the country of the blind long years
ago that valley lay so far open to the world that men
might come at last through frightful gorges and over
an icy pass into its equable meadows and thither
indeed men came a family or so of peruvian half-
breeds fleeing from the lust and tryanny of an evil
spanish ruler then came the stupendous outbreak
of mindobamba when it was night in quito for
seventeen days and the water was boiling at yagu-
achi and all the fish floating dying even as far as
guayaquil everywhere along the pacific slopes there
were land-slips and swift thawings and sudden floods
and one whole side of the old arauca crest slipped
and came down in thunder and cut off the country
of the blind for ever from the exploring feet of
men but one of these early settlers had chanced
to be on the hither side of the gorges when the world
had so terribly shaken itself and he perforce had to
forget his wife and his child and all the friends and
possessions he had left up there and start life over
again in the lower world he started it again but
ill blindness overtook him and he died of puniih-
ment in the mines but the story he told begot a legend
that lingers along the length of the cordilleras of the
andes to this day

  he told of his reason for venturing back from
that fastness into which he had first been carried
lashed to a llama beside a vast bale of gear when he
was a child the valley he said had in it all that
the heart of man could desire-sweet water pasture
and even climate slopes of rich brown soil with tan-
gles of a shrub that bore an excellent fruit and on
one side great hanging forests of pine that held the
avalanches high far overhead on three sides vast
cliffs of gray-green rock were capped by cliffs of
ice but the glacier stream came not to them but
flowed away by the farther slopes and only now and
then huge ice masses fell on the valley side in this
valley it neither rained nor
snowed but the abundant
springs gave a rich green
pasture that irrigation
would spread over all the
valley space the settlers
did well indeed there

their beasts did well and
multiplied and but one
thing marred their happi-
ness yet it was enough to
mar it greatly a strange
disease had come upon
them and had made all
the children born to them there-and indeed several
older children also-blind it was to seek some
charm or antidote against this plague of blindness
that he had with fatigue and danger and difficulty
returned down the gorge in those days in such
cases men did not think of germs and infections but
of sins and it seemed to him that the reason of this
affliction must lie in the negligence of these priestless
immigrants to set up a shrine so soon as they entered
the valley he wanted a shrine-a handsome cheap
effectual shrine-to be erected in the valley he want-
ed relics and such-like potent things of faith blessed
objects and mysterious medals and prayers in his

wallet he had a bar of native silver for which he
would not account he insisted there was none in the
valley with something of the insistence of an inexpert
liar they had all clubbed their money and orna-
ments together having little need for such treasure
up there he said to buy them holy help against their
ill i figure this dim-eyed young mountaineer sun-
burnt gaunt and anxious hat-brim clutched fever-
ishly a man all unused to the ways of the lower
world telling this story to some keen-eyed attentive
priest before the great convulsion i can picture him
presently seeking to return with pious and infallible
remedies against that trouble and the infinite dismay
with which he must have faced the tumbled vastness
where the gorge had once come out but the rest of
his story of mischances is lost to me save that i
know of his evil death after several years poor
stray from that remoteness the stream that had
once made the gorge now bursts from the mouth of
a rocky cave and the legend his poor ill-told story
set going developed into the legend of a race of blind
men somewhere over there which one may still
hear today

and amidst the little population of that now iso-
lated and forgotten valley the disease ran its
course the old became groping and purblind the
young saw but dimly and the children that were born
to them saw never at all but life was very easy in
that snow-rimmed basin lost to all the world with
neither thorns nor briars with no evil insects nor
any beasts save the gentle breed of llamas they had
lugged and thrust and followed up the beds of the
shrunken rivers in the gorges up which they had
come the seeing had become purblind so gradu-
ally that they scarcely no d their loss they guided
the sightless youngsters hither and thither until they
knew the whole valley marvellously and when at last
sight died out among them the race lived on they
had even time to adapt themselves to the blind con-
trol of fire which they made carefully in stoves of
stone they were a simple strain of people at the
first unlettered only slightly touched with the span-
ish civilization but with
something of a tradition
of the arts of old peru
and of its lost philosophy
generation followed gen-
eration they forgot many
things they devised many
things their tradition of
the greater world they
came from became mythi-
cal in color and uncertain
in all things save sight
they were strong and able
and presently the chance
of birth and heredity sent one who had an original
mind and who could talk and persuade among them
and then afterwards another these two passed
leaving their effects and the little community grew
in numbers and in understanding and met and set-
tled social and economic problems that arose gen-
eration followed generation there came a time
when a child was born who was fifteen generations
from that ancestor who went out of the valley with
a bar of silver to seek gods aid and who never
returned thereabouts it chanced that a man came
into this community from the outer world and this
is the story of that man

 rjr take many things for granted in this world
 rr we accept many preconceived notions about an
 amazingly large number of things which like as not
 prove to be amazingly wrong if any story ever proved
 this point the country of the blind certainly is that
 one the author exploits the well-known saying in the
 country of the blind the one-eyed man is king indeed
 that statement is most easy to believe and all logic should
 point that way in reading this interesting story you
 will soon find out how far wrong even seemingly good
 logic can be


amazing stories

  he was a mountaineer from the country near
quinto a man who had been down to the sea and had
seen the world a reader of books in an original way
an acute and enterprising man and he was taken on
by a party of englishmen who had come out to
ecuador to climb mountains to replace one of their
three swiss guides who had fallen ill he climbed
here and he climbed there and then came the attempt
on parascotopetl the matterhorn of the andes in
which he was lost to the outer world the story of
the accident has been written a dozen times pointers
narrative is the best he tells how the little party
worked their difficult and almost vertical way up
to the very foot of the last and greatest precipice
and how they built a night shelter amidst the snow
upon a little shelf of rock and with a touch of real
dramatic power how presently they found nunez
had gone from them they shouted and there was
no reply shouted and whistled and for the rest of
that night they slept no more

  as the morning broke they saw the traces of his
fall it seems impossible he could have uttered a
sound he had slipped eastward toward the un-
known side of the mountain far below he had struck
a steep slop of snow and ploughed his way down it
in the midst of a snow avalanche his track went
straight to the edge of a frightful precipice and be-
yond that everything was hjdden far far below
and hazy with distance they could see trees rising
out of a narrow shut-in valley-the lost country of
the blind but they did not know it was the lost
country of the blind nor distinguish it in any way
from any other narrow streak of upland valley un-
nerved by this disaster they abandoned their at-
tempt in the afternoon and pointer was called away
to the war before he coulclnake another attack to
this day parascotopetl lifts an unconquered crest and
pointers shelter crumbles unvisited amidst the snows

nd the man who fell survived

   at the end of the slope he fell a thousand feet
and came down in the midst of a cloud of snow upon
a snow slope even steeper than the one above down
this he was whirled stunned and insensible but with-
out a bone broken in his body and then at last came
to gentler slopes and at last rolled out and lay still
buried amidst a softening heap of the white masses
that had accompanied and saved him he came to
himself with a dim fancy that he was ill in bed then
realised his position with a mountaineers intelli-
gence and worked himself loose and after a rest or
so out until he saw the stars he rested flat upon
his chest for a space wondering where he was and
what had happened to him he explored his limbs
and discovered that several of his buttons were gone
and his coat turned over his head his knife had
gone from his pocket and his hat was lost though he
had tied it under his chin he recalled that he had
been looking for loose stones to raise his piece of the
shelter wall his ice-axe had disappeared

  he decided he must have fallen and looked up to
see exaggerated by the ghastly light of the rising
moon the tremendous flight he had taken for a
while he lay gazing blankly at that vast pale cliff
towering above rising moment by moment out of a
subsiding tide of darkness its phantasmal mys-
terious beauty held him for a space and then he
was seized with a paroxysm of sobbing laughter   

  after a great interval of time he became aware

that he was near the lower edge of the snow below
down what was now a moonlit and practicable slope
he saw the dark and broken appearance of rock-
strewn turf he struggled to his feet aching in
every joint and limb got down painfully from the
heaped loose snow about him went downward until
he was on the turf and there dropped rather than lay
beside a boulder drank deep from the flask in his
inner pocket and instantly fell asleep   

  he was awakened by the singing of birds in the
trees far below

  he sat up and perceived he was oil a little alp at
the foot of a vast precipice that was grooved by the
gully down which he and his snow had come over
against him another wall of rock reared itself against
the sky the gorge betweenjthese precipices ran east
and west and was full of the morning sunlight which
lit to the westward the mass of fallen mountain that
closed the descending gorge below him it seemed
there was a precipice equally steep but behind the
snow in the gully he found a sort of chimney-cleft
dripping with snow-water down which a desperate
man might venture he found it easier than it
seemed and came at last to another desolate alp and
then after a rock climb of no particular difficulty to
a steep slope of trees he took his bearings and
turned his face up the gorge for he saw it opened out
above upon green meadows among which he now
glimpsed quite distinctly a cluster of stone huts of
unfamiliar fashion- at times his progress was like
clambering along the face of a wall and after a time
the rising sun ceased to strike along the gorge the
voices of the singing birds died away and the air
grew cold and dark about him but the distant valley
with its houses was all the brighter for that he
came presently to talus and among the rocks he
noted-for he was an observant man-an unfamiliar
fern that seemed to clutch out of the crevices with
intense green hands he picked a frond or so and
gnawed its stalk and found it helpful

  about midday he came at last out of the throat of
the gorge into the plain and the sunlight he was
stiff and weary he sat down in the shadow of a rock
filled up his flask with water from a spring and drank
it down and remained for a time resting before he
went on to the houses

  they were very strange to his eyes and indeed the
whole aspect of that valley became as he regarded it
queerer and more unfamiliar the greater part of its
surface was lush green meadow starred with many
beautiful flowers irrigated with extraordinary care
and bearing evidence of systematic cropping piece by
piece high up and ringing the valley about was a
wall and what appeared to be a circumferential
water-channel from which the little trickles of water
that fed the meadow plants came and  the higher
slopes above this flocks of llamas cropped the scanty
herbage sheds apparently shelters or feeding-places
for the llamas stood against the boundary wall here
and there the irrigation streams ran together into a
main channel down the centre of the valley and this
was enclosed on either side by a wall breast high
this gave a singularly urban quality to this secluded
place a quality that was greatly enhanced by the fact
that a number of paths paved with black and white
stones and each with a curious little kerb at the side
ran hither and thither in an orderly manner the
houses of the central village were quite unlike the
casual and higgledy-piggledy agglomeration of the
the country of the blind



mountain villages he knew they stood in a continu-
ous row on either side of a central street of
astonishing cleanness here and there their parti-
coloured facade was pierced by a door and not a
solitary window broke their even frontage they
were parti-coloured with extraordinary irregularity
smeared with a sort of plaster that was sometimes
gray sometimes drab sometimes slate-coloured or
dark brown and it was the sight of this wild plaster-
ing first brought the word blind into the thoughts
of the explorer the good man who did that he
thought must have been as blind as a bat

he descended a steep place and so came to the
wall and channel that ran about the valley near
where the latter spouted out its surplus contents into
the deeps of the gorge in a thin and wavering thread
of cascade he could now see a number of men and
women resting on piled heaps of grass as if taking
a siesta in the remoter part of the meadow and
nearer the village a number of recumbent children
and then nearer at hand three men carrying pails on
yokes along a little path that ran from the encircling
wall towards the houses these latter were clad in
garments of llama cloth and boots and belts of
leather and they wore caps of cloth with back and
ear flaps they followed one another in single file
walking slowly and yawning as they walked like men
who have been up all night there was something
so reassuringly prosperous and respectable in their
bearing that after a moments hesitation nunez stood
forward as conspicuously as possible upon his rock
and gave vent to a mighty shout that echoed round
the valley

  the three men stopped and moved their heads as
though they were looking about them they turned
their faces this way and that and nunez gesticulated
with freedom but they did not appear to see him
for all his gestures and after a time directing them-
selves towards the mountains far away to the right
they shouted as if in answer nunez bawled again
and then once more and as he gestured ineffectually
the word blind came up to the top of his thoughts
the fools must be blind he said

  when at last after much shouting and wrath
nunez crossed the stream by a little bridge came
through a gate in the wall and approached them he
was sure that they were blind he was sure that
this was the country of the blind of which the
legends told conviction had sprung upon him and a
sense of great and rather enviable adventure the
three stood side by side not looking at him but with
their ears directed towards him judging him by his
unfamiliar steps they stood close together like men
a little afraid and he could see their eyelids closed
and sunken as though the very balls beneath had
shrunk away there was an expression near awe
on their faces

  a man one said in hardly recognisable spanish
-a man it is-a man or a spirit-coming down
from the rocks

  but nunez advanced with the confident steps of a
youth who enters upon life all the old stories of the
lost valley and the country of the blind had come
back to his mind and through his thoughts ran this
old proverb as if it were a refrain-

  in the country of the blind the one-eyed man
is king

j in the country of the blind the one-eyed man
is king

  and very civilly he gave them greeting he talked
 to them and used his eyes

  where does he come from brother pedro  asked
 one

  down out of the rocks

 j over the mountains i come said nunez out
 of the country beyond there-where men can see
 from near bogota where there are a hundred thou-
 sands of people and where the city passes out of
 sight

  sight muttered pedro sight

  he comes said the second blind man out of
 the rocks

 the cloth of their coats nunez saw was curiously
 fashioned each with a different sort of stitching

 they startled him by a simultaneous movement to-
 wards him each with a hand outstretched he
 stepped back from the advance of these spread
 fingers

 come hither said the third blind man following
 his motion and clutching him neatly

 and they held nunez and felt him over saying no
 word further until they had done so

 carefully he cried with a finger in his eye and
 found they thought that organ with its fluttering
 lids a queer thing in him they went over it again

 a strange creature correa said the one called
 pedro feel the coarseness of his hair like a
 llamas hair

 rough he is as the rocks that begot him said
 correa investigating nunezs unshaven chin with a
 soft and slightly moist hand perhaps he will grow
 finer nunez struggled a little under their examina-
 tion but they gripped him firmly

 carefully he said again

 he speaks said the third man certainly he
 is a man

 ugh said pedro at the roughness of his coat

and you have come into the world asked
pedro

 out of the world over mountains and glaciers
 right over above there half-way to the sun out of
 the great big world that goes down twelve days
 journey to the sea

 they scarcely seemed to heed him our fathers
 have told us men may be made by the forces of
 nature said correa it is the warmth of things
 and moisture and rottenness-rottenness

 let us lead him to the elders said pedro

 shout first said correa lest the children be
 afraid this is a marvellous occasion

 so they shouted and pedro went first and took
 nunez by the hand to lead him to the houses

 he drew his hand away i can see he said

 see said correa

 yes see said nunez turning towards him and
 stumbled against pedros pail

 his senses are still imperfect said the third
 blind man he stumbles and talks unmeaning
 words lead him by the hand

 as you will said nunez and was led along
 laughing

 it seemed they knew nothing of sight

 well all in good time he would teach them

 he heard people shouting and saw a number of
 figures gathering together in the middle roadway of
 the village


amazing stories

  he found it taxed his nerve and patience more
than he had anticipated that first encounter with the
population of the country of the blind the place
seemed larger as he drew near to it and the smeared
plasterings queerer and a crowd of children and men
and women the women and girls he was pleased to
note had some of them quite sweet faces for all
that their eyes were shut and sunken came about
him holding on to him touching him with soft
sensitive hands smelling at him and listening at
every word he spoke some of the maidens and chil-
dren however kept aloof as if afraid and indeed
his voice seemed coarse and rude beside their softer
notes they mobbed him his three guides kept
close to him with an effect of proprietorship and
said again and again a wild man out of the rocks
bogota he said bogota over the mountain
crests

a wild man-using wild words said pedro
did you hear that-bogota his mind is hardly
formed yet he has only the beginnings of speech
a little boy nipped his hand bogota he said
mockingly

  ay a city to your village i come from the
great world-where men have eyes and see

   his names bogota they said

  he stumbled said correa stumbled twice as
vve came hither

   bring him to the elders

and they thrust him suddenly through a doorway

into a room as black as pitch save at the end
there faintly glowed a fire the crowd closed in be-
hind him and shut out all but the faintest glimmer
of day and before he could arrest himself he had
fallen headlong over the fe of a seated man his
arm outflung struck the face of some one else as
he went down he felt the soft impact of features
and heard a cry of anger and for a moment he
struggled against a number of hands that clutched
him it was a one-sided fight an inkling of the
situation came to him and he lay quiet

  i fell down he said i couldnt see in this
pitchy darkness

   there was a pause as if the unseen persons about
him tried to understand his words then the voice
of correa said he is but newly formed he
stumbles as he walks and mingles words that mean
nothing with his speech

  others also said things about him that he heard
or understood imperfectly

  may i sit up he asked in a pause i will
not struggle against you again

   they consulted and let him rise

   the voice of an older man began to question him
and nunez found himself trying to explain the great
world out of which he had fallen and the sky and
mountains and sight and such-like marvels to these
elders who sat in darkness in the country of the
blind and they would believe and understand noth-
ing whatever he told them a thing quite outside his
expectation they would not even understand many
of his words for fourteen generations these people
had been blind and cut off from all the seeing world
he names for all the things of sight had faded and
changed the story of the outer world was faded and
changed to a childs story and they had ceased to
concern themselves with anything beyond the rocky
slopes above their circling wall blind men of genius

had arisen among them and questioned the shreds
of belief and tradition they had brought with them
from their seeing days and had dismissed all these
things as idle fancies and replaced them with new
and saner explanations much of their imagination
had shrivelled with their eyes and they had made for
themselves new imaginations with their ever more
sensitive ears and finger-tips slowly nunez realised
this that his expectation of wonder and reverence
at his origin and his gifts was not to be borne out
and after his poor attempt to explain sight to them
had been set aside as the confused version of a new-
made being describing the marvels of his incoherent
sensations he subsided a little dashed into listen-
ing to their instruction and the eldest of the blind
men explained to him life and philosophy and re-
ligion how that the world meaning their valley had
been first an empty hollow in the rocks and then had
come first inanimate things without the gift of
touch and llamas and a few other creatures that had
little sense and then men and at last angels whom
one could hear singing and making fluttering sounds
but whom no one could touch at all which puzzled
nunez greatly until he thought of the birds

  he went on to tell nunez how this time had been
divided into the warm and the cold which are the
blind equivalents of day and night and how it was
good to sleep in the warm and work during the cold
so that now but for his advent the whole town of the
blind would have been asleep he said nunez must
have been specially created to learn and serve the
wisdom they had acquired and that for all his mental
incoherency and stumbling behaviour he must have
courage and do his best to learn and at that all the
people in the doorway murmured encouragingly he
said the night-for the blind call their day night-
was now far gone and it behooved every one to go
back to sleep he asked nunez if he knew how to
sleep and nunez said he did but that before sleep
he wanted food

  they brought him food-llamas milk in a bowl
and rough salted bread-and led him into a lonely
place to eat out of their hearing and afterwards to
slumber until the chill of the mountain evening
roused them to begin their day again but nunez
slumbered not at all

   instead he sat up in the place where they had left
 him resting his limbs and turning the unanticipated
 circumstances of his arrival over and over in his
 mind

  every now and then he laughed sometimes with
amusement and sometimes with indignation

  unformed mind he said got no senses yet
they little know theyve been insulting their heaven-
sent king and master i see i must bring them to
reason let me think-let me think

  he was still thinking when the sun set

  nunez had an eye for all beautiful things and it
seemed to him that the glow upon the snowfields and
glaciers that rose about the valley on every side was
the most beautiful thing he had ever seen his eyes
went from that inaccessible glory to the village and
irrigated fields fast sinking into the twilight and
suddenly a wave of emotion took him and he thanked
god from the bottom of his heart that the power of
sight had been given him

  he heard a voice calling to him from out of the
village ya ho there bogota come hither

  at that he stood up smiling he would show these
the country of the blind



people once and for all what sight would do for a
man they would seek him but not find him

  you move not bogota said the voice

  he laughed noiselessly and made two stealthy
steps aside from the path

  trample not on the grass bogota that is not
allowed

  nunez had scarcely heard the sound he made him-
self he stopped amazed

  the owner of the voice came running up the pie-
bald path towards him

  he stepped back into the pathway here i am
he said

  why did you not come when i called you said
the blind man must you be led like a child can-
not you hear the path as you walk 

  nunez laughed i can see it he said

  there is no such word as see said the blind man
after a pause cease this folly and follow the sound
of my feet

  nunez followed a little annoyed

  my time will come he said

  youll learn the blind man answered there is
much to learn in the world

  has no one told you in the country of the blind
the one-eyed man is king  

  what is blind  asked the blind man carelessly
over his shoulder

four days passed and the fifth found the king
of the blind still incognito as a clumsy and use-
less stranger among his subjects

  it was he found much more difficult to proclaim
himself than he had supposed and in the meantime
while he meditated his coup detat he did what he
was told and learnt the manners and customs of the
country of the blind he found working and going
about at night a particularly irksome thing and he
decided that that should be the first thing he would
change

  they led a simple laborious life these people
with all the elements of virtue and happiness as these
things can be understood by men they toiled but
not oppressively they had food and clothing suffi-
cient for their needs they had days and seasons of
rest they made much of music and singing and there
was love among them and little children

  it was marvellous with what confidence and preci-
sion they went about their ordered world every-
thing you see had been made to fit their needs each
of the radiating paths of the valley area had a con-
stant angle to the others and was distinguished by a
special notch upon its kerbing all obstacles and ir-
regularities of path or meadow had long since been
cleared away all their methods and procedure arose
naturally from their special needs their senses had
become marvellously acute they could hear and
judge the slightest gesture of a man a dozen paces
away-could hear the very beating of his heart in-
tonation had long replaced expression with them and
touches gesture and their work with hoe and spade
and fork was as free and confident as garden work
can be their sense of smell was extraordinarily
fine they could distinguish individual differences as
readily as a dog can and they went about the tend-
ing of the llamas who lived among the rocks above
and came to the wall for food and shelter with ease
and confidence it was only when at last nunez

sought to assert himself that he found how easy and
confident their movements could be

   he rebelled only after he had tried persuasion

  he tried at first on several occasions to tell them
of sight look you here you people he said
there are things you do not understand in me

  once or twice one or two of them attended to
him they sat with faces downcast and ears turned
intelligently towards him and he did his best to tell
them what it was to see among his hearers was a
girl with eyelids less red and sunken than the others
so that one could almost fancy she was hiding eyes
whom especially he hoped to persuade he spoke of
the beauties of sight of watching the mountains of
the sky and the sunrise and they heard him with
amused incredulity that presently became condem-
natory they told him there were indeed no moun-
tains at all but that the end of the rocks where the
llamas grazed was indeed the end of the world
thence sprang a cavernous roof of the universe from
which the dew and the avalanches fell and when he
maintained stoutly the world had neither end nor roof
such as they supposed they said his thoughts were
wicked so far as he could describe sky and clouds
and stars to them it seemed to them a hideous void
a terrible blankness in the place of the smooth roof
to things in which they believed-it was an article
of faith with them that the cavern roof was ex-
quisitely smooth to the touch he saw that in some
manner he shocked them and gave up that aspect
of the matter altogether and tried to show them the
practical value of sight one morning he saw pedro
in the path called seventeen and coming towards the
central houses but still too far off for hearing or
scent and he told them as much in a little while
he prophesied pedro willlie here an old man re-
marked that pedro had no business on path seven-
teen and then as if in confirmation that individual
as he drew near turned and went transversely into
path ten and so back with nimble paces towards the
outer wall they mocked nunez when pedro did
not arrive and afterwards when he asked pedro
questions to clear his character pedro denied and
outfaced him and was afterwards hostile to him

  then he induced them to let him go a long way up
the sloping meadows towards the wall with one com-
placent individual and to him he promised to de-
scribe all that happened among the houses he noted
certain goings and comings but the things that really
seemed to signify to these people happened inside of
or behind the windowless houses-the only things
they took note of to test him by-and of these he
could see or tell nothing and it was after the failure
of this attempt and the ridicule they could not re-
press that he resorted to force he thought of seiz-
ing a spade and suddenly smiting one or two of them
to earth and so in fair combat showing the advantage
of eyes he went so far with that resolution as to
seize his spade and then he discovered a new thing
about himself and that was that it was impossible for
him to hit a blind man in cold blood

  he hesitated and found them all aware that he
had snatched up the spade they stood alert with
their heads on one side and bent ears towards him
for what he would do next

  put that spade down said one and he felt a sort
of helpless horror he came near obedience

  then he thrust one backwards against a house
wall and fled past him anr xit of the village


amazing stories

he went athwart one of their meadows leaving
a track of trampled grass behind his feet and
presently sat down by the side of one of their ways
he felt something of the buoyancy that comes to all
men in the beginning of a fight but more perplexity
he began to realise that you cannot even fight hap-
pily with creatures who stand upon a different mental
basis to yourself far away he saw a number of men
carrying spades and sticks come out of the street of
houses and advance in a spreading line along the
several paths towards him they advanced slowly
speaking frequently to one another and ever and
again the whole cordon would halt and sniff the air
and listen

  the first time they did this nunez laughed but
afterwards he did not laugh

  one struck his trail in the meadow grass and came
stooping and feeling his way along it

  for five minutes he watched the slow extension
of the cordon and then his vague disposition to do
something forthwith became frantic he stood up
went a space or so towards the circumferential wall
turned and went back a little way there they all
stood in a crescent still and listening

   he also stood still gripping his spade very tightly
in both hands should he charge them 

  the pulse in his ears ran into the rhythm of in
the country of the blind the one-eyed man is
king

  should he charge them

  he looked back at the high and unclimbable wall
behind-unclimbable because of its smooth plaster-
ing but withal pierced with many little doors and at
the approaching line of seekers behind these others
were now coming out of the street of houses

  should he charge then

  bogota called one bogota where are you

  he gripped his spade still tighter and advanced
down the meadows towards the place of habitations
and directly he moved they converged upon him
ill hit them if they touch me he swore by
heaven i will ill hit he called aloud look
here im going to do what i like in this valley do
you hear im going to do what i like and go where
i like

  they were moving in upon him quickly groping
yet moving rapidly it was like playing blind mans
buff with every one blindfolded except one get
hold of him  cried one he found himself in the arc
of a loose curve of pursuers he felt suddenly he
must be active and resolute

  you dont understand he cried in a voice that
was meant to be great and resolute and which broke
you are blind and i can see leave me alone

  bogota put down that spade and come off the
grass

  the last order grotesque in its urban familiarity
produced a gust of anger

  ill hurt you he said sobbing with emotion by
heaven ill hurt you leave me alone

  he began to run not knowing clearly where to
run he ran from the nearest blind man because it
was a horror to hit him he stopped and then made
a dash to escape from their closing ranks he made
for where a gap was wide and the men on either side
with a quick perception of the approach of his paces
rushed in on one another he sprang forward and
then saw he must be caught and swish the spade
had struck he felt the soft thud of hand and arm

and the man was down with a yell of pain and he
was through

  through and then he was close to the street of
houses again and blind men whirling spades and
stakes were running with a sort of reasoned swift-
ness hither and thither

  he heard steps behind him just in time and found
a tall man rushing forward and swiping at the sound
of him he lost his nerve hurled his spade a yard
wide at his antagonist and whirled about and fled
fairly yelling as he dodged another

  he was panic-stricken he ran furiously to and
fro dodging when there was no need to dodge and
in his anxiety to see on every side of him at once
stumbling for a moment he was down and they
heard his fall far away in the circumferential wall
a little doorway looked like heaven and he set off in a
wild rush for it he did not even look around at his
pursuers until it was gained and he had stumbled
across the bridge clambered a little way among the
rocks to the surprise and dismay of a young llama
who went leaping out of sight and lay down sobbing
for breath

  and so his coup detat came to an end

  he stayed outside the wall of the valley of the
blind for two nights and days without food or
shelter and meditated upon the unexpected dur-
ing these meditations he repeated very frequently
and always with a profounder note of derision the
exploded proverb in the country of the blind the
one-eyed man is king he thought chiefly of ways
of fighting and conquering these people and it grew
clear that for him no practicable way was possible
he had no weapons and now it would be hard to get
one

the canker of civilisation had got to him even in
bogota and he could not find it in himself to go
down and assassinate a blind man of course if he
did that he might then dictate terms on the threat of
assassinating them all but-sooner or later he must
sleep   

  he tried also to find food among the pine trees to
be comfortable under pine boughs while the frost fell
at night and-with less confidence-to catch a llama
by artifice in order to try to kill it-perhaps by ham-
mering it with a stone-and so finally perhaps to eat
some of it but the llamas had a doubt of him and
regarded him with distrustful brown eyes and spat
when he drew near fear came on him the second
day and fits of shivering finally he crawled down to
the wall of the country of the blind and tried to
make terms he crawled along by the stream shout-
ing until two blind men came out to the gate and
talked to him

  i was mad he said but i was only newly
made

   they said that was better

  he told them he was wiser now and repented of
all he had done

  then he wept without intention for he was very
weak and ill now and they took that as a favourable
sign

  they asked him if he still thought he could see

  no he said that was folly the world means
nothing-less than nothing

  they asked him what was overhead

  about ten times ten the height of a man there is
a roof above the world-of rock-and very very
the country of the blind



smooth    he hurst again into hysterical tears
before you ask me any more give me some food
or i shall die

  he expected dire punishments but these blind
people were capable of toleration they regarded his
rebellion as but one more proof of his general idiocy
and inferiority and after they had whipped him they
appointed him to do the simplest and heaviest work
they had for any one to do and he seeing no other
way of living did submissively what he was told

  i le was ill for some days and they nursed him
kindly that refined his submission but they in-
sisted  his lying in the dark and that was a great
misery and blind philosophers came and talked to
him of the wicked levity of his mind and reproved
him so impressively for his doubts about the lid of
rock that covered their cosmic casserole that he al-
most doubted whether indeed he was not the victim
of hallucination in not seeing it overhead

  so nunez became a citizen of the country of the
blind and these people ceased to be a generalised
people and became individualities and familiar to
him while the world beyond the mountains became
more and more remote and unreal there was yacob
his master a kindly man when not annoyed there
was pedro yacobs nephew and there was medina-
sarote who was the youngest daughter of yacob
she was little esteemed in the world of the blind
because she had a clear-cut face and lacked that satis-
fying glossy smoothness that is the blind mans ideal
of feminine beauty but nunez thought her beautiful
at first and presently the most beautiful thing in the
whole creation her closed eyelids were not sunken
and red after the common way of the valley but lay
as though they might open again at any moment
and she had long eyelashes which were considered a
grave disfigurement and her voice was strong and
did not satisfy the acute hearing of the valley swains
so that she had no lover

  there came a time when nunez thought that could
he win her he would be resigned to live in the valley
for all the rest of his days

  he watched her he sought opportunities of doing
her little services and presently he found that she
observed him once at a rest-day gathering they sat
side by side in the dim starlight and the music was
sweet his hand came upon hers and he dared to
clasp it then very tenderly she returned his pres-
sure and one day as they were at their meal in
the darkness he felt her hand very softly seeking
him and as it chanced the fire leapt then and he saw
the tenderness of her face

  he sought to speak to her

  he went to her one day when she was sitting in
the summer moonlight spinning the light made her
a thing of silver and mystery he sat down at her
feet and told her he loved her and told her how
beautiful she seemed to him he had a lovers voice
he spoke with a tender reverence that came near to
awe and she had never before been touched by
adoration she made him no definite answer but it
was clear his words pleased her

  after that he talked to her whenever he could take
an opportunity the valley became the world for
him and the world beyond the mountains where men
lived in sunlight seemed no more than a fairy tale he
would some day pour into her ears very tentatively
and timidly he spoke to her of sight

  sight seemed to her the most poetical of fancies

and she listened to his description of the stars and the
mountains and her own sweet white-lit beauty as
though it was a guilty indulgence she did not be-
lieve she could only half understand but she was
mysteriously delighted and it seemed to him that she
completely understood

  his love lost its awe and took courage presently
he was for demanding her of yacob and the elders
in marriage but she became fearful and delayed
and it was one of her elder sisters who first told
yacob that medina-sarote and nunez were in love

  there was from the first very great opposition to
the marriage of nunez and medina-sarote not so
much because they valued her as because they held
him as a being apart an idiot incompetent thing be-
low the permissible level of a man her sisters op-
posed it bitterly as bringing discredit on them all
and old yacob though he had formed a sort of liking
for his clumsy obedient serf shook his head and said
the thing could not be the young men-were all
angry at the idea of corrupting the race and one
went so far as to revile and strike nunez he struck
back then for the first time he found an advantage
in seeing even by twilight and after that fight was
over no one was disposed to raise a hand against him
but they still found his marriage impossible

  old yacob had a tenderness for his last little
daughter and was grieved to have her weep upon
his shoulder

  you see my dear hes an idiot he has delusions
he cant do anything right

  i know wept medina-sarote but hes better
than he was hes getting better and hes strong
dear father and kind-stronger and kinder than any
other man in the world and he loves me-and
father i love him

old yacob was greatly distressed to find her in-
consolable and besides-what made it more
distressing-he liked nunez for many things so he
went and sat in the windowless council-chamber with
the other elders and watched the trend of the talk
and said at the proper time hes better than he
was very likely some day we shall find him as sane
as ourselves

  then afterwards one of the elders who thought
deeply had an idea he was the great doctor among
these people their medicine-man and he had a very
philosophical and inventive mind and the idea of
curing nunez of his peculiarities appealed to him
one day when yacob was present he returned to
the topic of nunez

  i have examined bogota he said and the case
is clearer to me  think very probably he might be
cured

  that is what i have always hoped said old
yacob

  his brain is affected said the blind doctor

  the elders murmured assent

  now what affects it

  ah said old yacob

  this said the doctor answering his own ques-
tion those queer things that are called the eyes
and which exist to make an agreeable soft depression
in the face are diseased in the case of bogota in
such a way as to affect his brain they are greatly
distended he has eyelashes and his eyelids move
and consequently his brain is in a state of constant
irritation and distraction


amazing stories

yes said old yacob yes

 and i think i may say with reasonable certainty
 that in order to cure him completely all that we
 need do is a simple and easy surgical operation-
 namely to remove these irritant bodies

 and then he will be sane

 then he will be perfectly sane and a quite ad-
 mirable citizen

 thank heaven for science said old yacob and
 went forth at once to tell nunez of his happy hopes

 but nunezs manner of receiving the good news
 struck him as being cold and disappointing

 one might think he said from the tone you
 take that you did not care for my daughter

 it was medina-sarote who persuaded nunez to
 face the blind surgeons

 you do not want me he said to lose my gift of
 sight 

 she shook her head

 my world is sight

 her head drooped lower

 there are the beautiful things the beautiful little
 things-the flowers the lichens among the rocks the
 lightness and softness on a piece of fur the far sky
 with its drifting down of clouds the sunsets and the
 stars and there is you for you alone it is good to
 have sight to see your sweet serene face your
 kindly lips your dear beautiful hands folded to-
 gether  it is these eyes of mine you won these
 eyes that hold me to you that these idiots seek in-
 stead i must touch you hear you and never see you
 again i must come under that roof of rock and stone
 and darkness that horrible roof under which your
 imagination stoops  no you would not have me
 do that

 a disagreeable doubt had arisen in him he
 stopped and left the thing a question

 i wish she said sometimes- she paused

 yes said he a little apprehensively

 i wish sometimes-you would not talk like that
 like what

 i know its pretty-its your imagination i love

it but now-

 he felt cold nozv he said faintly

 she sat quite still

 you mean-you think-i should be better better

perhaps-

 he was realising things very swiftly he felt
 anger indeed anger at the dull course of fate but
 also sympathy for her lack of understanding- a
 sympathy near akin to pity

 dear he said and he could see by her whiteness
 how intensely her spirit pressed against the things she
 could not say he put his arms about her he kissed
 her ear and they sat for a time in silence

 if i were to consent to this he said at last in a
 voice that was very gentle

 she flung her arms about him weeping wildly
 oh if you would she sobbed if only you would 

 for a week before the operation that was to raise
 him from his servitude and inferiority to the level
 of a blind citizen nunez knew nothing of sleep and
 all through the warm sunlit hours while the others
 slumbered happily he sat brooding or wandered aim-
 lessly trying to bring his mind to bear on his di-
 lemma he had given his answer he had given his
 consent and still he was not sure and at last work-
 time was over the sun rose in splendour over the

golden crests and his last day of vision began for
him he had a few minutes with medina-sarote
before she went apart to sleep

  to-morrow he said i shall see no more

  dear heart she answered and pressed his hands
with all her strength

  they will hurt you but little she said and you
are going through this pain-you are going through
it dear lover for me    dear if a womans heart
and life can do it i will repay you my dearest one
my dearest with the tender voice i will repay

  he was drenched in pity for himself and her

  he held her in his arms and pressed his lips to
hers and looked on her sweet face for the last time
good-bye he whispered at that dear sight good-
bye 

  and then in silence he turned away from her

  she could hear his slow retreating footsteps and
something in the rhythm of them threw her into a
passion of weeping

  he had fully meant to go to a lonely place where
the meadows were beautiful with white narcissus
and there remain until the hour of his sacrifice should
come but as he went he lifted up his eyes and saw
the morning the morning like an angel in golden
armour marching down the steeps   

  it seemed to him that before this splendour he and
this blind world in the valley and his love and all
were no more than a pit of sin

  he did not turn aside as he had meant to do but
went on and passed through the wall of the circum-
ference and out upon the rocks and his eyes were al-
ways upon the sunlit ice and snow

  he saw their infinite beauty and his imagination
soared over them to the things beyond he was now to
resign for ever

  he thought of that great free world he was parted
from the world that was his own and he had a
vision of those further slopes distance beyond dis-
tance with bogota a place of multitudinous stirring
beauty a glory by day a luminous mystery by night
a place of palaces and fountains and statues and
white houses lying beautifully in the middle distance
he thought how for a day or so one might come
down through passes drawing ever nearer and nearer
to its busy streets and ways he thought of the river
journey day by day from great bogota to the still
vaster world beyond through towns and villages
forest and desert places the rushing river day by
day until its banks receded and the big steamers came
splashing by and one had reached the sea-the limit-
less sea with its thousand islands its thousands of
islands and its ships seen dimly far away in their
incessant journeyings round and about that greater
world and there unpent by mountains one saw
the sky-the sky not such a disc as one saw it here
but an arch of immeasurable blue a deep of deeps
in which the circling stars were floating   

  his eyes scrutinised the great curtain of the moun-
tains with a keener inquiry

  for example if one went so up that gully and to
that chimney there then one might come out high
among those stunted pines that ran round in a sort of
shelf and rose still higher and higher as it passed
above the gorge and then that talus might be
managed thence perhaps a climb might be found to
take him up to the precipice that came below the
snow and if that chimney failed then another far-
ther to the east might serve his purpose better and
the country of the blind



then then one would be out upon the amber-lit
snow there and half-way up to the crest of those
beautiful desolations

he glanced back at the village then turned right
round and regarded it steadfastly

he thought of medina-sarote and she had become
small and remote

he turned again towards the mountain wall down 
which the day had come to him

then very circumspectly he began to climb

when sunset came he was no longer climbing but
he was far and high he had been higher but he was
still very high his clothes were torn his limbs were
blood-stained he was bruised in many places but he
lay as if he were at his ease and there was a smile
on his face

from where he rested the valley seemed as if it

were in a pit and nearly a mile below already it was
dim with haze and shadow though the mountain
summits around him were things of light and fire
the mountain summits around him were things of
light and fire and the little details of the rocks near
at hand were drenched with subtle beauty-a vein of
green mineral piercing the gray the hash of crystal
faces here and there a minute minutely-beautiful
orange lichen close beside his face there were deep
mysterious shadows in the gorge blue deepening into
purple and purple into a luminous darkness and
overhead was the illimitable vastness of the sky but
he heeded these things no longer but lay quite in-
active there smiling as if he were satisfied merely
to have escaped from the valley of the blind in which
he had thought to be king

  the glow of the sunset passed and the night came
and still he lay peacefully contented under the cold
clear stars

the electro-hydraulic bank protector

 it was in vain that croffitt exerted his utmost strength to escape the viscous embrace    and it was not long before he was smeared
 with glue from head to foot    the two were executing a strange two-step on the mosaic their shoes got stuck on the floor by th
 heavy sticky mass tb running off them and this made their efforts increasingly more frantic
hicks inventions with a kick



he maid brought in a card i took it
read it and threw it in the waste basket

  tell him i am on my vacation i
said in a voice loud enough to be
heard three rooms off and just at
that moment hicks entered

  i tell you  sat in my chair like petrified since
that episode of the automatic apartment i had not
seen hicks-at close range at least for nine months
i had been daily kicking myself for having allowed
him to talk me into fixing up another demonstration
for him-and that after the first one had resulted in
disaster i had been dodging those people on the
street myself ever since and in my walks about town
i was in a continuous sweat lest i meet one of them
face to face guess my feelings then at that mans
colossal nerve when he appeared uninvited just as i
was throwing his card into the waste basket

  as i sat there speechless hicks advanced and
proffered me a small flat package done up in fancy
paper and tied with red string mechanically i took
that package and undid the thread methodically
slowly i unwrapped it hicks in the meantime had
sat down in my easiest chair and gravely lit a cigar-
ette inside the package there was a fancy box i
opened it a golden cigarette case came into view
in the middle of the cover beautifully engraved my
eye read my name fred c okeefe with fas-
tidious care i lifted the cover twenty cigarettes
of the well-known super-expensive brand abdullah
were neatly arranged in two rows

   he click of the box as i snapped it shut brought
me back to my senses

  hicks i said hoarsely get get out-this in-
stant   and i shoved the case toward him on the
table

i had expected a brazen smile and a smart answer
but i was mistaken hicks looked sad as he replied 

  okeefe wont you let me apologize wont
you give me a chance to make repairs  i never did
you any harm intentionally and i want to make good
that which i did unwittingly cant you pardon a
man say so if you will and i will go right now
even so i wish you would accept my little peace
offering-i picked it as you see especially for you

  appeal to my generosity and i am sunk i suppose
its that celtic blood in me
or something but thats
the way it is i knew he
had won right then

ill go if you say so

hicks resumed rising i
came here only to   

he seemed overcome with
emotion

  stay i said dont
think that i am ungen-
erous give me your hand-i know you meant no
harm

  hicks shook hands with me so hard that i got a
headache

  but i said that cigarette case-i really can-
not take it old man such a costly present-i really
cannot

  you must eagerly returned hicks cant let
you refuse-absolutely cant on my account you
spoiled a suit  

  two suits i said reminiscently

  wo suits said hicks reddening a little you

 are right now i know you wouldnt let me pay
 for that suit-i mean those suits-so you really
 must take the load off my mind by accepting this
 little present from me

   well  i said

   and besides there is something else about that
 case you havent seen all turn it over and have
 a look 

i

the reason why

 turned the cigarette case over
 of it i found engraved

on the back

commemorating the initiation of the hicks
electro-hydraulic bank protector

 i read and below was the cryptic emblem

sr

   what been initiating another invention i
 said how did it come off this time

   er    not been exactly okeefe said hicks
 but going to now just a minute-dont say any-
 thing yet-this is different he went on hastily as he
 noticed clouds forming on my brow this is dif-
 ferent the burnt child dreads the fire okeefe
 and i have learned my lesson this is all right and
 i think you will believe jne when i tell you that i
 have a banker backing me and that the installation
 of the protector in a bank is just being finished
 and-i dont want you to invite anybody-i am
 doing the inviting myself this time

   where what bank what banker i asked
my interest aroused for you know bankers are seri-
ous men-the most serious men in the world

   e f croffitt of the surburban national said
 hicks

   he couldnt have said more if he had talked a
 month i knew e f croffitt in fact he had re-
 cently refused to extend

 tiithout a question the electro-hydraulic bank
 rr protector is the best of the hicks series so jar
 if you enjoy rough and tumble humor with side-splitting
 situations yon will enjoy this story yes as usual it
 contains plenty of good science and the scheme docs not
 look so foolish as it may seem however there is a
 double-barreled ending to the tale which will make you
 laugh loud and long

 my note and that under
 aggravating circumstances
 a more bloodless cold-
 hearted pigheaded tight-
 wad surely never trod the
 earth if he had commit-
 ted himself so far as to
 allow anything to be in-

- stalled in his bank surely

                          it must be all right tak-
 ing chances was not in e f croffitts dictionary all
 the sporting blood in his system diluted with one
 hundred parts of distilled water would have made
 exactly one small teaspoon ful

   if you want me to be there hicks count on me
 where e f croffitt takes a chance i will any
 time

   thanks old boy hicks heartily responded
 i am glad to say that the others seemed to feel
 the same way you know okeefe life means
 nothing to me unless i have the esteem of my friends
 thats why i came here and thats why i wrote


amazing stories

the others sending each of the men a golden cigar-
ette case like yours and each of the women a golden
vanity case i have heard from four and i expect
to hear from the rest to-day i am sure i will

the great day

as we agreed i made my appearance at the
fourth street branch of the suburban na-
tional bank at  oclock friday morning
there was one drawback-it was friday-and i
dont like fridays and on my way to the bank i
noticed it was the th i am not superstitious but
i was worried for a while about that combination
but finally i told myself that it was all nonsense
besides i was soon too deeply interested in what
there was to see to be worrying about a silly matter
of dates the suburban national had been adding
to its floor space and the new division was all but
ready to be thrown open to the public part of the
space was made a long room parallel with the street
and this was faced by the usual row of some twelve
or fifteen clerks and tellers windows to my
cursory glance indeed everything looked very much
like in any ordinary bank though i remember being
struck by the fact that the partition ran right up to
the ceiling and though of ornate design was unbroken
except for the windows and had an uncommonly
solid appearance my attention was also arrested by
what appeared to me as an unusual number of
electric-light columns also of highly ornamental
character grouped along in front of the partition
my reflections on the reason for all this were pres-
ently terminated when hicks who had espied me as
i entered came rushing up and led me to meet
the company some twenty people were present of
whom i already knew about half i braced myself
for a shock as  came face to face with irvine but
he shook hands with me quite amicably so did
hicks uncle jeremiah who had also been present at
the inauguration of the automatic apartment i
nearly backed out as i met smith-he is a violent
man you know-but even he took my proffered
hand its wonderful what those cigarette cases
had done i mentally reflected this time i had
promised myself not to bring anyone along and so
neither aunt zelinda nor aunt eulalia were there
professor dinker and his fiancee also were missing
i guess their experiences with the automatic apart-
ment had been too much for their dignity how-
ever this lack was made up for by the company the
banker had supplied there were two other presi-
dents of banks one was mr quague a little
skinny hungry-looking individual who had the ap-
pearance of not being able to count ten but had
on numerous occasions been known to multiply his
assets by that figure the other was mr lvragg
who was fat coarse wide and an incessant talker
three skinny females to whom i was introduced
proved to be his wife who was gushing about art
and his daughters who had their fathers face and
their mothers form with the addition of bandy-legs
-not the best possible combination i thought
among the remaining people  knew mr schmaltz
the chief teller of the suburban national and then
there was e f croffitt himself a tallish bald-
headed man of forty-five who wore glasses and
whose peculiar mincing gait contrasted strangely
with his big feet and ungainly figure and whose
painful attempts at an engaging smile immediately

brought to mind the picture of an amiable and tender-
hearted snake beaming upon its intended victim he
was here there and everywhere conversing in an
oily and yet rasping voice full of pride and anticipa-
tion and now he addressed the company he en-
larged upon the crime situation in general and bank-
holdups in particular and at the end of his sonorous
remarks introduced hicks

unaccustomed as i am-

  really must apologize when i address
  r you modestly began the inventor i am

  jl no orator and mr croffitt has presented bet-
ter than i could the underlying reasons for the in-
vention of the hicks electro-hydraulic bank pro-
tector but i wish to sketch to you the central idea
back of the invention itself mr croffitt has referred
to the fruitless attempts of the police to curb rob-
beries the police are doing all they can under
present conditions but they are undermanned and
therefore handicapped to a great extent and a more
serious condition even is the absolute failure of the
courts to adequately punish those criminals whom
often at great expense and risk of life the police do
apprehend when i say this i am only repeating
facts with which you are all but too familiar

  now what inquired hicks is the remedy in
the face of a situation such as this he paused
for a moment waiting for an answer if the police
are unable to catch the criminals and the courts are
unable to mete out proper punishment to instill suf-
ficient respect in the minds of those who intend to do
evil then it is up to the citizens to catch the criminal
so utterly and unfailingly defeat him that even after
he has served his term he will remember the experi-
ence with feelings of unalloyed and unforgettable
terror

  hicks had raised his voice and emphasized these
last remarks and now he stopped to take a breath
e f croffitt and the other two bankers nodded
gravely in a pleased way and a general murmur
of assent ran through the company

  the more i thought of this idea hicks con-
tinued the more i was taken with it how to
defend the bank and its treasures against the holdup
man became the subject of my thoughts by day and
my dreams by night what complicated the problem
was that while apprehending the wrong-doer with
unfailing certainty and creating in the mind of every
criminal the feeling that the bank instead of being
a fit prey for his nefarious activity was a place
to be shunned like the plague it was necessary to
guard the public and the bank employees from in-
jury for a while i will frankly admit it seemed
hopeless it would take too long to even sketch an
outline of my labors the many false scents i fol-
lowed as it were let it suffice that after a vast
expenditure of concentrated mental effort i finally
developed the hicks electro-hydraulic bank pro-
tector a system of bank protection totally differing
from others a weird combination you may think
at first blush yet i am sure you will find it a logical
remedy strange diseases call for strange medicines

  you may wonder for instance at the idea of
hydraulics of water under pressure for a purpose
such as this at first it seems odd but let us con-
sider for a moment when there is a riot and it all
seems hopeless when the police with night sticks and
hicks inventions with a kick



revolvers are unable to cope with the situation when
the unreasoning mob is no longer deterred by fear
of death and injury then who is called in why
the fire department

  as hicks made this pronouncement a pleased hum
of approbation could be heard the idea had struck
home

  when the inmates of a jail or a madhouse grow
rebellious and raise pandemonium in their cells day
and night and no punitive measures seem to take
effect when isolation starvation straightjackets are
of no use then what is hicks continued and an-
swering his own question why water streams
of cold water big cold streams under high pressure
as soon as the water hose is brought in the fight
the riot ends no fight has ever been known to
last one minute after the fire hose began to play on
the fighters men will fight in a hail of bullets they
will brave death from bombs and grenades they
will keep on fighting after they are bleeding from a
dozen wounds but turn a big powerful stream
of cold water on them and the most ferocious fighter
quits

  i use electricity to bring about that sudden re-
lease of the water that is necessary to obtain the
desired effect however it also operates the armor-
plate shutter t have provided for each window the
idea of so protecting the tellers windows is not new
it has been tried out but for one reason or another
has met with only partial success one of the most
serious troubles is that in his rage and disappoint-
ment the hold-up man is apt to run amuck and kill
people at random such a system therefore be-
comes positively dangerous yet combined with the
proper complementary idea it makes a splendid de-
vice i will show you how i found this combination

i beg your pardon for a moment

  number nine down daniels hicks called

  in a flash our view through the window in front
of which we were assembled into the interior of the
banking room was shut off there was a hiss and
a click and we were face to face with grey steel

scientific facts

htt may interest you commented the inventor
to know this shutter is made of a new

  a chromemolybdenum steel which when heat-
treated develops extraordinary properties the
minimum tensile strength is  lbs and it shows
a brinnel hardness of about  in a plate such as
this which has a thickness of an eighth of an
inch no bullet from any pistol will make more than a
slight dent

  respectful silence greeted this announcement
everybody looked serious somebody whispered
tremendous croffitt and kragg gravely wagged
their heads there is nothing better than scientific
facts to make people think i say

  what is more interesting right now however is
that the face of the shutter is formed with a number
of slightly concave indentations similar to a magnify-
ing mirror such a mirror is used to reflect and con-
centrate light the purpose of these concavities also
is to reflect and concentrate-not light but water

  there was a ripple of excitement the interest
was rising apparently ignoring this the inventor
went on

  so we now come to the hydraulic part of my

system let us pause for a moment and see what we
want to accomplish we want to catch the criminal
that is true but first and foremost we want to
defend ourselves against him in these days of gang
banditry we must be prepared for a condition where
one or two of a company of robbers undertake the
hold-up and other members stand ready to start a
general attack if things do not go as intended the
tellers windows of course present the only profit-
able point of attack the modern bank bandit is a
desperate and quick-witted individual seeing a
comrade foiled by the shutter other members might
for instance place an explosive against some of the
windows  has been tried so they must be warded
off-absolutely prevented from even getting near a
window

  now suppose we had a four-inch stream of water
under a pressure say of two hundred pounds per
square inch if we were to direct this stream
against this shutter from a distance of say three
feet then what would be the effect

  the effect would be tremendous the power of a
stream of water like this is something that cannot
be imagined until one has seen it presently i shall
give you a practical and convincing demonstration
of what such a stream will do in the meantime let
us reason out just what will take place the water
will be deflected by the surface of the shutter as
that surface is divided up into a number of concave
surfaces having their foci placed at a variety of
slightly different angles the four-inch stream now
divided into two dozen smaller streams will be
thrown back with tremendous force from the shutter
right in the face of the attacker-a blinding un-
escapable elemental rush of water against which
there can be no thoughtof fight-in the face of
which resistance becomes a mere ridiculous fantasy
and action of any kind whether concerted or not
a preposterous joke

why smith got scared

as the inventor paused to wipe the perspiration
from his face it was clear that hicks logic
 was hitting the mark the whole thing had
a first seemed odd but now it turned out to be a
wonderful piece of reasoning just then smith
nudged me and drew me aside i looked at him
worry was sitting on his brow

  i am going he said

  what for i asked astonished

  what for why because i am afraid of this
nut and his stuff here hes got water again-and
look at the force under  lbs pressure per
square inch why i dont feel safe near those
pipes even its a long time since i went to engineer-
ing college but i   

  why man you mean to say you studied to be
an engineer this from me for that study fasci-
nates me beyond anything else

  yes i did and  

  and now you are content to be a cheesemonger
   er er    i mean you know  i dont
mean  i meant to say    well now 
i stuttered i wonder will i ever get over that con-
founded impulsive way of mine of putting things
i didnt think at that moment that smith always
seemed supersensitive about that business of his-
got a delicatessen store you know


amazing stories

  for forty seconds smith said nothing but re-
garded me with a gaze of fierce intensity

  you were saying i gently urged yes you
were saying 

  gradually smiths face relaxed and his glance lost
some of its steely fierceness after a pause that
seemed like a month he ground out slowly

  well as i meant to say when you interrupted me
this stuff doesnt look safe to me pressure way
too high too much trigger business about those
electrical controls why that stream of water turned
on a man would be enough to throw him fifty feet
okeefe i am going

  may be so but i am staying i announced
maybe it is too high what of it we can always
get out we are on the street level the room is
big there are doors you will be missing some-
thing if you go if i were you id stay come on
stay

  smith did not reply whether my argument or
fear of being thought afraid changed his mind i
dont know but he stayed he was uneasy though
meanwhile this conversation had lost me a part of
hicks speech

wonderful reasoning

      talve practically hidden in the top of this
 column and designed to throw the water at
t an angle of forty-five degrees to the wall
surface the water being actually deflected however
in a general horizontal direction and straight out by
reason of the inclination of the concavities in the
shutter to which i referred while the stream as it
issues from the nozzle will therefore miss the head
of the person standing in front his face and the
entire upper portion of his body will be the target
of the rebounding water at a distance of two feet
but even six feet away though spread out wider the
power of the spray will still be so great that it will
be impossible for any human being to hold his
ground

  you may wonder why i first direct the stream
against the window it might seem more practical
and simple to direct a number of streams from the
window against the intruder but that would com-
plicate matters instead of simplifying them instead
of one valve i would need at least a dozen and
they would have to be built in around the window
you can see some of the complications already and
then while such a system would ward off the bandit
it would still be incomplete protection a bomb with
the fuse burning for instance might still remain on
the window sill

  with the present arrangement not only are all
complications avoided but the torrent of water boil-
ing over the window would immediately sweep away
and render ineffectual any explosive charge after
all as you see the indirect way here proves the best
and the simplest way out

hicks smiled a little as he noticed how his neat
piece of reasoning was being appreciated by
his audience remarks such as sure is good won-
derful fellow isnt he just fine-this from the
women-more or less subdued were to be heard on
every side you can bet that i shared in the general
appreciation only smith seemed aloof and looked
sullen and worried

  a general switchboard resumed the inventor
back in the tellers room and which you can see
through these windows in the inner banking room
takes care of all electrical controls it is now ex-
posed to allow final adjustments to be made but later
it will be covered by a box and locked to prevent
untoward happenings one of the controls on this
board is for the operation of the shutter from the
action of which results the opening of the overhead
valve but what i have so far pointed out to you is
only the first line of defense you will remember
that we do not merely want to scare the holdup man
away but that we want to apprehend him-we want
to utterly confound him all along the line and so
we come to the piece de resistance of the hicks
electro-hydraulic bank protector namely the hy-
draulo-centrifugal rotating system it is here that
the punitive features of my invention come in

  with hicks pointing out things i quickly began to
see system in the arrangement of the columns there
were four grouped in front of each tellers window
to form a square having sides of about two feet and
a half-all four meeting in graceful gothic curves
overhead where they were topped by a beautiful
cluster of lights two of the columns were within a
few inches from the partition and in fact ran
through the counter the other pair being set out
further into the room in the left hand one of
these there was located the four-inch nozzle and
centered between them on the floor there was a
raised circular step about eighteen inches in diameter
upon which anybody would have to stand in talking
to the teller i had paid no particular attention to
this before

some technical data

ii  his round step hicks said is in reality
i a revolvable platform i say revolvable
jl not revolving because ordinarily it is fixed
but as soon as the shutter has dropped it is free
to revolve you have already seen that one of these
columns is really a standpipe i want to add that
the remainder are the same and as you see here
each one of them has at a height of from three
to five feet and under the guise of ornamental ex-
crescences a row of three short nozzles with a two-
inch opening now if youll look closely continued
hicks you will notice that these nozzles are pointed
in a direction that would be about tangent to the
body of the person standing on the platform now
what is the idea here

  suppose we were to direct four tangent streams
at the round platform on which the person stands
continued the inventor what would happen why
it would revolve-it would start to spin at a speed
of which the ratio would be determined by the diam-
eter of the platform the area of contact the force
of the water stream and the frictional coefficient
between the water and the peripheral surface of the
platform

  good i cried go on some of the com-
pany turned round and looked at me but i simply
cant help it i am gone on that stuff some day
when i have time ill take a course in engineering

  hicks looked around him pleased and continued
so when we apply the four triple two-inch streams
each under two hundred pound pressure per square
inch to the body of a person standing on a platform
hicks inventions with a kick



-mounted i will add on roller bearings-and when
we consider that the muzzle velocity of the stream is
approximately  feet per second and figure the
mean diameter of the average person the frictional
area presented by the clothing and the coefficient of
friction of the clothing and water  

  good i broke in good fine

  why then i find that after all necessary deduc-
tions are made an average rotational speed of ap-
proximately three hundred and forty revolutions
per minute should be obtained

  i restrained myself with difficulty from patting
hicks on the back inwardly i swore he should
have one of those two bottles of hennessy pive star
i had at home as for the company they were hum-
ming with remarks president croffitt wore a broad
hard smile on his face the other two presidents
were whispering in that impressive way that bankers
have

         what happens to the robber

t ow resumed hicks picture the situation

          the hold-up man enters fie steps on the
x  platform-there is no other choice the
teller suddenly looks into the muzzle of a gun slip
me five thou or youre dead is the demand the
teller steps on the button there is a crash-all
the shutters in the room are down perhaps the
burglar shoots-no matter the shutter can stand it
and it would be his last vicious act for within three-
tenths of a second after the shutter is down the
twelve valves open simultaneously the water is
under  lbs pressure escape is impossible-you
cannot cross such a stream ten feet away from the
nozzle and here it is only two at the end of the
first second the robber is spinning around at the
rate of one hundred and twenty revolutions per min-
ute after one hundred revolutions however or in
time seventeen seconds the water is shut off we
dont want to kill him you know dazed uncon-
scious he collapses on the floor meanwhile the re-
maining tellers windows have automatically been
closed the rotating system is here inactive but
tremendous sprays of water from the first line de-
fense are playing into the room some of the cus-
tomers of course will get a scare and all of them
will get a wetting but that is a matter of trivial
moment compared to the fact that the attack is foiled
and a decisive setback given to future nefarious
schemes as for the robber he is beyond escaping
by his own effort there is still one possibility-he
might be carried out by accomplices but even this
his last ray of salvation is annihilated by the final
and crowning feature of the hicks electro-hydraulic
bank protector-the adhesive reaction

  if you will look overhead-we all did and for
the first time i noticed in the ceiling above us what
looked like a semi-spherical metal ornament about
two feet in diameter-you will see corresponding
with the row of tellers windows and exactly above
each platform a corresponding row of my patented
adhesive droppers each of these bowl-shaped af-
fairs is made in four sections which are hinged at
the top when closed each bowl contains-you will
be surprised to hear it-one hundred pounds of the
strongest adhesive known-le pages liquid glue

	there was no question that this was indeed a sur-
prise some one laughed banker croffitt smiled
a hard pleased smile

  it might look like a humorous touch said hicks
also smiling but it is in fact from the standpoint
of the bank the needed final link of protection and
from the point of view of the gangster the final link
in the chain that will bind his wrists the glue is
contained in an envelope of celluloid so thin that it
will just suffice to keep it togther so long as it is in
the bowl of the dropper but instantly bursts into
fragments when the ball is dropped now complete
the picture the burglar unconscious has collapsed
on top of the platform one of his colleagues un-
dertakes to carry him out before he can even raise
him or to be exact in two and a quarter seconds
after the rotating streams have been shut off the
bowl opens and a solid ball of glue two feet across
and weighing one hundred pounds drops from a
height of twelve feet the effect i need hardly say
is final insofar as escape is concerned did you
ever in fastening things together get a little glue on
your fingers and then try to do anything if you
did then you have some faint idea of what a man
can do or what can be done with him after one
hundred pounds of liquid glue have been dropped all
over him

a case of cold feet

for a few moments there was silence and
then there was clapping of hands led by
e f croffitt himself everybody crowded
around him and the inventor congratulating one
or both asking questions expressing admiration
only smith stood aside with a scowl on his face

  i am going he said

  why man what is biting you now

  his wife had overheard us for she chimed in
you are going billy what for

  dont like that stuff i told you i have a sort
of a feeling  i am afraid of that high pressure
and that fool mechanism and that centrifugal
stuff-remember the automatic dining table as
for those electric controls-think of the automatic
apartment and what it did to us you come along
but i am enjoying this mrs smith objected
i am going to stay

then stay if you want to but i am going

  for a moment i hesitated myself but i quickly
recovered

  stay smith i urged come on be a man
you wouldnt leave mrs smith here alone anyway
would you dont spoil the fun-do me a favor
you arent really afraid are you

  that settled him he stayed but he was looking
no more cheerful-less so if anything

  now ladies and gentlemen hicks brisk voice
was saying we will have a practical demonstration
in the rear of the room and far away from the
scene of action i have had built a platform a foot
from the floor from which you may watch pro-
ceedings dry footed when the water starts to play
it will be confined to the opposite end of the room
i have had prepared a dummy-here he patted the
shoulder of a life-size doll intended to represent g
muffled hold-up man-which we will put through
its paces when it comes to turning the water on
but first we will need some dry action mr kragg
lias volunteered to play the sinister burglar and mr
schmaltz will take his place at the window and repre-
sent what he is in real life-a teller
	am azin g

  schmaltz a small round man was immediately
installed behind the tellers window mr kragg
to the general amusement was tying a handkerchief
across his face

  all ready daniels cried hicks there was
no answer must have gone out for a moment
said the inventor try your button mr schmaltz
and see if the shutter is acting its all safe-the
water is shut off

a practical demonstration of hydraulics

i could see schmaltz moving slightly side-
ways as he fumbled for the button with his
foot there was a little jerk and the shutter
moved as if it were trying but it did not come
down and then with a hiss with the suddenness
and force of an explosion a mighty stream of water
issued from the overhead nozzle and struck the
counter just in front of schmaltz it was all so
quick that i noticed schmaltz was still smiling when
the deflected stream now flattened hit him right
under the chin even in that tiny fraction of a
second the thought shot across my brain that hicks
had said he would give a convincing demonstration
of the inconceivable power of such a stream of
water-and here it was the next moment the re-
bounding stream had lifted the unfortunate teller
in the air a doubled-up ball of humanity he was
turning a rearward somersault over a table right
behind him one two three four turns executed
with fantastic rapidity the broadening stream of
water playing on the periphery of the human ball
that was schmaltz and accelerating his rotation
and then abruptly he landed sitting down but with
a sliding motion on the switchboard the last
thing i remember seeing were miscellaneous pieces
of the bottom of his pants adhering to various levers
and other protuberances on the switchboard what
became of him from that moment on i do not re-
member for i was busy elsewhere

  even before any of the women had time to give
vent to a shriek the inventors despairing yell re-
sounded through the room piercing the crash of the
tumbling body and the roar of the water

  the switchboard-god help us-must get at it-
doors locked and with incredible speed he made
for the nearest window-the shutters had all re-
mained open and the whole thing was evidently out
of gear for nothing was happening the way it should
even as i wondered at hicks presence of mind i
noticed that smith was also about to climb through
another window and i distinctly recall in that
moment regretting that i had ever thought him a
coward for here he was one of the only two men of
action in the crowd-the others were paralyzed i
was too

the hydraulic rotating system in action

all this happened in a fraction of a second

as i have observed before in emergencies
l the human mind works with lightning speed
as hicks was lifting one knee to get into the win-
dow i heard a distinct loud click and at the same
moment i saw ten thousand stars and found myself
sitting twelve feet away on the floor yet on some-
thing remarkably soft i distinctly recall noticing
this detail and then i noticed that i was getting

stories

hit at rapid intervals and that i was wet and getting
wetter i had hardly had time to associate these
various facts with the tangential streams from hicks
window when my dazed senses were stung into
wide-awakeness by the spectacle which now pre-
sented itself to my one good eye of hicks nothing
was to be seen but there was a tall column of water
which was whirling around with incredible rapidity
and from which at frequent irregular intervals there
issued offshoots in the form of mighty spurts of
water in four directions simultaneously a roar as
of a high-power turbine punctuated by staccato
splashes as the branching streams hit something or
somebody was to be heard the room all over was
one mass of horizontal geysers and everybody present
was floored some of the company lying in heaps over
each other and crawling about in their misery from
one place to another only to get into worse trouble

  i only noticed these things by the way for my hor-
rified gaze was riveted on the upright whirling mael-
strom which i knew contained hicks and then
suddenly i remembered that smith behind me had
tried to get through a window too and turning half
around on where i sat-i was quite unconscious that
i was sitting on mrs kragg and as i afterwards
realized was merely feeling an undercurrent of irri-
tation at the shrieks of agony proceeding from under-
neath-i saw another whirling waterspout a few
feet away with a dark core which i knew to be
smith poor heroic fellow i remember saying
to myself and then one of the tangential streams
branched off and hit me on the ear so hard that i
was knocked off my perch and  was the one that
urged him to stay i thought as i turned over and
rolled off a little shiver ran down my spine-it
was not due to the water i say there is nothing
like the human mind-strangest thing in all the
world

what i have related so far took place probably
in no more than four seconds the surprise
attack had been so sudden and so fierce that only a
few screams for the most part quickly muffled by
fierce darts of water had been heard but long
before the two unfortunates ceased their involuntary
mad-dervish whirl shrieks curses maledictions
advice to get out orders to do this or that demands
to stop it filled the air somebody had crawled to
the door and tried it i knew it was no use-hicks
had said it was locked-it had been his last remark
logical too-part of the scheme i knew we were
caught even as i vyas ineffectually trying to dodge
the fierce intermittent shots of water that were assail-
ing me from two sides it had just dawned on me
that i might slightly better my situation by crawling
elsewhere when i suddenly noted that the streams
had ceased instantly the tholight flashed through
my brain that a hundred revolutions had been com-
pleted-part of hicks system was working anyway
my head was turned in the inventors direction and
even as i was looking the envelope of water sud-
denly dropped from him and hicks no longer sus-
tained by the tremendous gyratory force of the vor-
tex collapsed between the four columns a wet de-
formed mass

  i heard a piercing scream behind me and turned
round mrs smith was draping her wet but opulent
form over the prostrate body of her husband who
was dazedly trying to raise his head
hicks inventions with a kick



  oh my poor curly-headed baby mrs smith
was saying in a pitiable tone as she put her arm
tenderly around her husbands neck its funny
how i am built but even half-dazed though i was i
knew that that appellation was not altogether correct
for smith is bald forty years old and weighs over
two hundred pounds this didnt seem to matter to
mrs smith though

the power of glue

	h my poor little curly-headed boy she

  i  was saying for the second time my
   she got no further there was a
rush as of something soft and heavy a dark
shadowy form swept by there was a dull heavy
sap and mrs smith seemed to crumple upon her
husband while her head and shoulders were blotted
out by a greenish mass about two feet in diameter

  it was one of the adhesive reactions-i knew it
instantly

  help i    gob    gob    gob  i
turned to see whence the new cry of alarm issued
and saw hicks who had managed to sit upright
looking like a humorous sketch of a deep-sea diver
his head appeared six times its natural size envel-
oped as it was in a hundred-pound gob of liquid ad-
hesive in that moment i knew what he had meant
when he talked of the psychological effect of the
thing-it was awful and yet i knew only the be-
ginning

  e f croffitt sprang to the aid of mrs smith
all bankers are chivalrous he could not make her
hear for the adhesive had enveloped her- entire head
in a coat an inch thick and was slowly spreading in
heavy greenish streams down over her body or drip-
ping off here and there in big drops-but he sought
her hands with his and succeeded in raising her
just then mrs smith blew an opening through the
coat of glue over her mouth a blood-curdling shriek
rent the air as she fell around croffitts neck the
banker tried to get away but there was no getting
away instead the lady drew him closer and closer
to her bosom blindly seeking protection where
she knew there was human flesh it was in vain
that croffitt exerted his utmost strength to escape the
viscous embrace his struggles only got him mixed
up more and it was not long before he was smeared
with glue from head to foot the adhesive by this
time had worked down on both their garments and
was all over their shoes the two mrs smith hold-
ing the banker in a tight embrace were executing a
strange two-step on the mosaic their shoes got
stuck on the floor by the heavy sticky mass that was
running off them and this made their efforts increas-
ingly more frantic under croffitts superhuman
struggles to wrench his feet free first one oxford
and then the other followed by both his socks re-
mained adhering to the floor as they stumbled
about in their weird and sticky dance they backed
into the inventor who had made a breathing hole
in his glue mask by swallowing a quart or so and
in trying to claw some of the stuff off his head
and neck had enveloped his hands in sticky gobs
eight inches in diameter under the impact he now
put these out blindly and closed them from behind
over the bankers face croffitts roar of rage at this
new injury shook the ceiling but was almost instantly

stifled as a big gob got lodged in his mouth he
swallowed hard-down it went

schmaltz does his bit

while i was watching this new develop-
ment with a sort of nightmare interest i
realized subconsciously that all this time the
thundering of water had not ceased i turned my head
towards the partition and instantly i knew the reason
it was only the tangential streams that would cease
at the end of seventeen seconds-the four-inch line
of defense was going full force but as the shutters
had refused to act they were blazing away through
the windows into the interior banking room what
had become of schmaltz the question struck me
with a sickening mental thud had he been killed 
was he drowned  i raised myself and looked cross-
wise through one of the windows fifteen enormous
streams were playing against the opposite wall from
which they were rebounding with a frightful roar
a subdued powerful hum i noticed now was shak-
ing the room-the noise caused by the tremendously
fast travel of the water through the pipes but
where was schmaltz  there in the midst of a boil-
ing water volcano issuing from the opposite wall up
to his waist in water he was-i saw a head and
arms he was alive he was doing something too
-fumbling with the switchboard good fine
i almost cried to know that he had not been killed

  and just then another thought struck me with
annihilating force the switchboard  let him fool
with it and only the almighty knew what would
happen next

 shut up get out leave it alone i
screamed he did not hear the noise was too
much but i shouted again i gesticulated he
did not see i turned round in despair kragg was
standing near me

  got to get him to leave that switchboard alone
i yelled-hell raise the devil if he dont

  kragg proved a man of action lets both yell
at him-he may hear that-he roared at me as he
went as near the window to me as the oblique stream
from above would let him now

let out my yell-but got only half through
it beneath the roar of waters i heard a sharp
click there was a black flash and i would in-
stantly have known that the shutter was down even
if the tremendous spray of the recoiling water which
barely missed me had not apprised me of the fact
the realization that i had escaped came simultane-
ously with the knowledge that kragg had not he
must have had his head right in line with the re-
bounding spray there was an explosion of water as
the boundless hydraulic force made contact with his
face this lasted but the hundredth part of a second
however then kragg head backwards with in-
conceivable speed and the force of a battering ram
was shot out into the room with a sickening thud
his head bored itself into irvines stomach-he had
been standing right in line irvine shut up like a
jack-knife and the combined bulk of the two men
landed on quague the sigh of the escaping air
from the little banker as the three hundred and
fifty pounds abruptly sat on his stomach could be
heard even through the thundering and hissing of the
water


amazing stories

  elsewhere in the room the water was raising in-
describable havoc after the first baptism had
ended most of the people had instinctively backed
against the wall opposite the partition in their desire
to get as far away as possible from the source of
those tangential torrents they now however found
themselves in the very worst place for by the time
the four-inch streams had gone nearly across the
room they had spread enough so that the entire
expanse of the opposite wall was to use a para-
doxical expression under fire-the remainder of the
room being under water anyway-which was now
two feet deep under the relentless play of those
mighty fountains nobody was able to keep his ground
some on their hands and knees were crawling out
toward the partition again others were crouched
with their faces against the wall hats sticks and
gloves ladies handbags and other articles were float-
ing around in the boiling sea i was one of the few
who had remained near the partition and was there-
fore comparatively comfortable for i was merely
sitting in water up to my chest i was still in a
dazed and detached way admiring the strange effects
produced by the mighty spray playing upon the
kragg-irvine-quague trio and wondering about their
seeming inability to get disentangled from each other
when abruptly the streams ceased flowing and the
roar of the waters ended the stillness which fol-
lowed by comparison seemed like the stillness of
death

the field of batde

here and there half-crazed human beings
women with their dresses sticking to
them men with wilted collars and clothes
from which the water was running in rivers were
raising themselves from the deluge the fierce tune
of the water discharge was replaced by a tune in a
new key women wept and sobbed men cursed
as yet weakly but as if they meant it as reason
began to return ominous glances were focused in
the direction of hicks so far as he was concerned
the water display had been a benefit as it had to
mrs smith and croffitt by washing some of the
glue off them smith himself was propped up
against the wall his face was pale but his glance
was ferocious and it was bent upon me i re-
gretted to see how quickly he was recovering mrs
smiths face was clean but her hair was a solid mass
of adhesive croffitt had risen he had a thick wad
over his neck and ears and his entire front elevation
was still besmeared with the stuff as he stood there
in this array minus shoes and stockings i decided
he did not make a very impressive figure but his
glance at hicks was absolutely frightful the water
was rapidly draining off-that part of the system
was working anyway with my mind still in a reel
i dully vaguely wondered what would happen when
those people really woke up and then the thought
flashed through my mind that after all we-this
company-were the best proof of the efficiency of
the hicks protective system how could robbers
hold up a bank such as this

a little surprise

there was a pounding at the door help
is coming cried mrs kragg jubilantly
we are rescued-a fool remark-what
in the devil did we need rescuing for anyway all

we had to do was to walk out i might even slip
out-ahead of smith i felt better

  the door opened four men entered they closed
it behind them t was surprised to note how care-
fully they closed it

  the four men advanced at first blush these
rescuers did not look inspiring two were little
skinny ferrety-looking individuals with hard shifty
eyes and harder mouths the third was a brutal-
looking heavy-set young man who chewed a quid
and the last man who entered a lank hatchet-faced
individual had a positively evil look

  hold up yer hands an line up agin de wall if
yer dont wanna be killed ordered the lank indi-
vidual and he jerked out a big pistol which he
waved in our general direction now dont make
no noise shoot de foist guy wot makes a wrong
move butch he said casually to the heavy-set man

  sure will jake replied that worthy

  now go trough deir clothes yer two ordered
the leader for none less was the lank man at this
the two ferrety-looking yeggs started a business-like
survey of our clothing they worked fast yet took
time to be thorough and it was surprising to see
how much they collected watches rings bracelets
jewelry worth thousands of dollars were stripped
from us in a few moments and this was joined by
an equally large sum in cash

  now ole baldy the leader disrespectfully ad-
dressed e f croffitt show us de way to yer strong
room an open it fer us deres a good guy-yer
dont wanna have de sexton trow de doit on yer
nose in a coupla days does yer now

  why i have no vault here  at least the
money isnt in it its in the other part of the
bank stuttered croffitt

  quitcher lyin yer big stiff snarled the leader
an show us de coin

  i  i  i assure you said croffitt

  lemme put a knife atween is ribs jes lemme
chimed in butch is jes a-achin ter do it jake
an it aint gonna make no noise

  get busy sudden or yerr dead snapped jake
and shoved the muzzle of the big pistol right under
croffitts nose the bankers face grew ashen i
will he whispered

  while the two rat-faced men held the rest of us
at bay with drawn revolvers jake and butch entered
the inner room i could see from the point where i
was standing how with trembling hands e f
worked the combination he stepped back and
butch by him pistol pressed to his side the leader
went in and presently came outwith several bundles
of bank notes evidently he was an expert who did
not care to encumber himself with heavy stuff e f
crdffitt groaned dont take it-theres a hundred
thousand dollars please dont-i am a ruined man
he moaned

  course we aint gonna take it baldy observed
the facetious butch jes gonna look it over an
see if its all dere and den give it back to yer jes
bank examiners dats all we is aint we jake

  sure that worthy responded jes a-takin
care o the interests o de dee-positors dats wot we
is

  when croffitt had been conducted back among us
the four hold-up men backed away a few steps and
the leader addressed us

  we been a-watchin yer lil game fer a while
hicks inventions with a kick



said jake kinda kep me eye on de joint les see
how dis ere bank pertective stuff woiks i says ter
me lil playmates here an it sure woiked aint
youse de guy wot invented it he suddenly asked
turning to hicks the inventor pale slowly nodded

  say buddy i likes yer jake said impulsively
yer done us a good toin i likes yer an here is
four bits what says i does and diving in his pocket
he fetched out a half-dollar and pressed it into hicks
hand

  now gummy do yer stuff we gotta be a-goin
he commanded at this word one of the rat-faced
men drew out a small parcel which he deftly lighted
and threw in the air almost at once the room was
filled with dense black smoke

  stay dere an dont raise hell or yerll all suffer
was the parting command as the four crooks went
out through the door we heard them lock it from
the outside and then the cry fire banks afire
ring de alarm which was immediately taken up by
other voices outside

  the morristown fire department is celebrated for
its efficiency it seemed that we had hardly had time
to stumble about in the dense smoke to try the door
and find it really was locked before we heard the

clanging of the bells and the shriek of the sirens
in a jiffy in less time than it takes to tell plate-glass
windows were smashed in and six tremendous
streams of water played into the room searching
every corner in vain were our shrieks yells curses
there was smoke and where there is smoke there
must be fire that was enough the morristown
fire department know their duty it was only after
our company had been floored for the time after
we had been utterly confounded and beaten down
and were crawling around in two feet of water in a
condition of absolute and abject misery that a fire-
man climbed through to investigate

  i was not present to hear what was said neither
was smith neither was hicks for we were going
down the street smith was running like a long dis-
tance champion but over my shoulder i saw he
was hopelessly outdistanced-i was ahead of him
you know and i looked back a number of times
to reassure myself for hicks who was ahead of me
was going so fast that i seemed to be running back-
wards and i wasnt trying to catch him at that-
maybe smith was i reached my apartment and
locked myself in-and next day i left for the west
i needed a vacation

                          the end

the authors explanation of the astounding discoveries of dr mentiroso

 start imnn

there are several
catches in the
story of the as-
tounding discoveries
of doctor mentiroso
and therein lies the
solution if doctor
mentiroso traveled
from west to cast at

	miles per hour
and was free from all 
frictional resistance
and the attraction of
gravitation he would
remain approximately
over the same spot
upon the earth in-
definitely as the earth
would be traveling at
the same speed through
space and without the
resistance of the atmos-
phere or gravitational
pull he would be left
far behind unless he were traveling eastward at 
miles per hour if he reversed his direction and headed
west at  miles per hour being of course free
from gravitational pull and atmospheric resistance
he would be passing the surface of the earth at 
miles per hour although still traveling about the earths
axis at  miles per hour hence he would make a
complete circuit although in an opposite direction
every  hours so that the sun to him would rise in
the west and set in the east and his days would be 
hours long he would arrive back at his starting point
 hours later with his time agreeing with the earths
time at that point if he traveled at a speed of say

	miles per hour it would not affect the earths time
but would merely result in each of his days being one
hour long or in other words the sun to him would rise
and set every hour as all our time is based upon the
earths rotation and orbit doctor mentirosos time if
traveling faster than the earth and free from its atmos-
pheric envelope would have no real connection with

if traveling east to wet at  wh

if traveling east to west at  hph

earth time it would in fact be similar to time upon a
distant planet theoretically he would of course return
to his starting point before he left it provided he went
by earth time but just as soon as he begins traveling
about the earths axis faster than the earth itself he
produces his own individual time in other words if his
days were one hour long when traveling at  miles
per hour according to our conception of an hour which
is one twenty-fourth of the period between sunrise and
sunrise then his hours would be one twenty-fourth of
an earth hour and his speed based on that would be only

	miles per his hour the whole question is one of
relativity and regardless of what speed he attained his
time in relation to earth time would remain constant and
the instant he set foot on earth he would find that the
time was precisely what it would have been had he
traveled about the earths axis at  miles per hour

the undersea express



 a d

r years i had planned a voyage to
xindon in one of the big i e c sub-
lersibles yet never until this day had
been able to adjust my business and
ther affairs so as to arrange the trip
there were compensations in this however for the
patents of the international express company had
lately expired making it possible for me to see the
newer developments which had placed the com-
panys vessels so far ahead of the many other sub-
marine ships that unloaded their cargoes from the
water-filled labyrinth beneath the city streets mr
babbington vice president of the company had
been kindness personified he had arranged for me
to see everything yet as we waited for a sight
of the scheduled ship each succeeding minute served
to increase my impatience

  half an hour of this and i was decidedly ill-
humored i glared about the little subterranean
room noticing for the tenth time the small elevator
which nestled in the corner read to lift us to the
level of old- broadway  feet overhead i stared
balefully at be pale little man who sat before a
small switchboard fingering a row of push-buttons
i felt like clutching his throat not because he was
the cause of the submersibles lateness but because
i was angry and he was anemic and miserable-look-
ing my eyes wandered to the channel side of the
chamber an immense wall of thick though trans-
parent glass the size of a show-window whose pro-
tecting bars of steel reminded me of the prisons used
in the days of our forefathers then as i gazed
out into the green liquid on the far side of the glass
i was conscious that my friend mr babbington
had touched the operator at the switchboard for a
moment i thought the latter had turned on another
big lamp which was filling the channel with light
but as i looked the glare came nearer and with a
sudden pumping of my heart i knew that my ship
had come at last

  the giant cigar-shaped
vessel nosed her way
along and as the forward
portion of her length
slipped by i saw the cap-
tain at the bridge which
resembled a small bay-win-
dow he waved a hand to
mr babbington whom i
heard muttering about fate
and fortune and the mon-
etary value of the forty-
five minutes which the sub-
mersible had lost then
just as i read the large
white letters upon her hull
signifying that she was the international express
company ship number  of new york city she
came to a stop with a gentle tremor against the
bumper side-clips

  a second later the pale operator pushed one of
his buttons and as my eyes followed the direction of
his t saw a huge vertical cylinder cleaving the water
in its descent upon the waiting submarine    there
was a mild clash of steel on steel and then as
another button felt the anemic finger of the operator
six metal arms swung out from the cylinder lock-

  ing themselves firmly to as many thistle-keys simul-
taneously a current of bubbling water began to
stream from a series of electro-hinged ports extend-
ing around the base of the big tube this however
ceased in a few seconds whereupon a light flashed
on above the switchboard

  come on cried mr babbington thats the
signal-the water is ejected from the cylinder the
 will open her hatches and loading will begin

  i	followed him into the elevator which whisked us
up  feet to the loading room where the clang
and din of new yorks busy streets were wafted
down through the ventilators these noises were as
echoes of the sounds which should have issued from
this room of arriving crates and departing boxes
but from the room itself there were no loud noises
no clashing of heavy articles no shouting no rattling
of trucks i noticed piles of packages and crates de-
posited gently on the floor by compressed air chutes
leading from the checking room on the street level
each pile was labeled according to its destination-
seattle san francisco london paris singapore
peking etc the shipments for chicago and seattle
were at the moment being gathered up by powerful
little gas-reciprocating cranes and dumped on large
lift platforms which carried them up through the ceil-
ing mr babbington nodded toward the ascending
boxes to the air liners he said elevators go
to landing towers on the roof

we arrived at the tubular shafts leading to the
channel in time to see my baggage disappear
into the depths two elevators were unloading while
a third sent down a stream of various sized bales
soon one lift was switched to loading work and
shortly after all three were carrying down their con-
signments destined for points in the british isles

  as the loading work neared completion the pas-
senger lift brought up a ruddy white-haired man
dressed in the uniform of a ship captain

  im sorry mr babbington he said advancing
toward us but i can make up the forty-five minutes

if i can get up on the
surface somewhere on
the other side of this
storm

  thats all right jud-
son replied the vice
president with more good
humor than he felt but
what happened to you 
my locator dial showed
you off sandy hook not
two hours ago

  didnt you get my
message 

  no i have been show-
ing our plant to my friend
here and turning to me this is captain judson
skipper of the  who will take care of you aboard
ship

  judson shook my hand heartily and continued

  there is quite a blow out there he went on
some surface ship dragged her anchor and pulled
up one of those old old cables-a relic of the days
of wire communication well it fouled my propeller
and i had to stop long enough for my divers to
repair the damage

  i trust you have better luck this trip replied

 iv these days of trans-atlantie flights one would think
 that the idea of an undersea express would be rather
 far-fetched but this need not necessarily be so for the
 simple reason that when trans-atlantic flying becomes
 commonplace as it will during the next few years such
 traffic due to the high cost will most likely be for pas-
 sengers the heavy freight will continue to travel by
 ocean liners or perhaps by the undersea express for
 better speed as no storms will impede the progress of a
 subsea vessel there are other advantages too

   our new author being a lieutenant in the u s army
 takes us into the not-too-distant future and somehow you
 gain the impression that it is all very real and that you
 may live to see it


amazing stories

mr babbington in serious tones you have a con-
signment aboard which must reach the london office
of littleton  roberts by  p m tomorrow
otherwise we lose the  guarantee we put up

  dont worry we shall reach london on time
said the captain

  a hurrying official brought captain judson his
clearance papers before mr babbington could put
in another word and we all walked to the passenger
elevator a handshake a wave of adieu and two of
us were speeding downward through the steel tube

  i stepped out into a well-lighted passage-way as
captain judson following me pressed a signal but-
ton on the door of the elevator this conveyance
passengerless rose from our midst and disappeared
up the shaft some unseen mechanism caused the
heavy rods and guides to slide noiselessly against the
wall and the great hatch slowly swung upwards on
its hinges to close the aperture above it before i
followed my conductor toward the bow i heard
the grating and clank of metal above the closed
hatch as the cylinder wasreleased from its thistle-
keys

  captain  said with some awe suppose that
through an error one of those telescopic cylinders
should be withdrawn before you close the hatch
we should be drowned like rats

  couldnt he retorted shortly thistle-keys wont
unlock until hatch has clicked shut

  we emerged into a chamber which the captain
identified as the bridge opposite us i could see the
channel lights through the long narrow arc of glass
extending from beam to beam a seaman stood at
the wheel surrounded by numerous dials and indica-
tors captain judson joined him and when a green
light flashed on above the binnacle moved forward
the throttle

  i looked out and saw the slimy walls of the channel
slip by under the intense brilliance of our headlight
at intervals traffic lamps came into view and shad-
ows flitted across our bows as we approached and
passed under them twice i saw submersibles being
loaded from cylinders similar to that through which
i had descended

  in the distance appeared a red light blinking rapid-
ly i noticed our skippers hand retard the throttle
and felt the thrumming of the ship decrease to a
bare perceptibility we came to a complete stop
beneath the red glow and as t strained my eyes at
the window a tremendous submarine vessel lum-
bered athwart our bow

  united tobacco freighter mumbled judson
biggest submersibles built- footers but very
slow

  the light suspended above us turned green and
the  forged ahead we emerged into a small
lake where the helm was put over hard so that the
beam of our headlight shone into another channel
leading to the open sea

fifteen minutes had passed when a young man
walked in

  this is mr larkin my first officer grumbled
the captain by way of introduction

  we bowed and grinned at each other as our com-
mander continued

  those two lights we just passed mark the en-
trance to the channel he said addressing me
see that green light off our port bow that is the
rockaway guide light over there is the manhattan

beach guide-yes that flashing one in a few min-
utes you will see the sandy hook light off our
starboard side

  i remembered having read about the latter light-
the most powerful in use it was invented by gaut-
tauve who after spending his life in research
offered the results of his labor to the government
but although the strongest underwater light then
known could not be seen from a distance of eight
miles this wonderful lamp was rejected gauttauve
died a soured and disappointed man but his discov-
eries and inventions as united in his lamp lived
after him to light the submerged shores of the prin-
cipal ports of the world

  larkin interrupted my thoughts by stepping up to
take his turn on the bridge but captain judson
shook his head

   ill stick it out until we get well away from these
lights and buoys he said you take our friend
through the ship

  larkin smilingly led me down the corridor

  the old man is obsessed with the idea that all
those lights are confusing to the rest of us mur-
mured the first officer good humoredly the truth
is that he is prejudiced against them i le prates
for hours at a time of the days when submarine
navigation was done with no other aids than head-
light and compass

  we went down a short companionway to the
engine room where the powerful machinery was driv-
ing us along at ninety knots an hour just inside the
door and extending across the breadth of the room
were batteries of immense vacuum tubes whose cath-
ode ravs gave off characteristic gleams of phosphor-
escence

  each one capable of  hp remarked larkin
simply during his explanations

  but to me the real marvel was the gas which
under the magic of cathode rays possessed un-
fathomed properties of expansion the great diffi-
culty in its use was to employ all its tremendous
power that is to control the expansion larkin
told me that the man who could do this would re-
ceive a fortune even greater than that of carpenter
the discoverer of the gas

i watched the great whirring turbines and
wondered if man-made machinery could ever
withstand the full power of the expansion i heard
the whistling gas leap from the triple expansion
chambers and still under the action of cathode rays
slash against the vanes of the turbines only to scream
its way out on the far side and die a natural death in
the refrigerating system

  we began the inspection of the ventilating plant
where pure oxygen manufactured from bilge water
was diffused through every inch of our ships four
hundred and twenty feet of length i was about to
press larkin for details when an alarm bell on the
wall began ringing furiously

  every man to his post he shouted come on
to the bridge and well find out whats up

  we rushed in to find captain judson bending over
the collision guide were going to be delayed he
groaned have to go to the assistance of a tramp
the lubber was too near the surface and scraped the
bottom of an iceberg well well see what can be
done larkin take a turn about the ship and see
that everyone is standing by you may then remain
at the p e while i keep the bridge
the undersea express



  as the mate departed i glanced at the depth in-
dicator the arrow was fairly flying   
 it read the pointer on the collision guide now
extended straight toward our bow

  a nervous voice shouted from the communicator
horn ahoy  do you hear me

  judson growled assent through his communicator
mouthpiece

  well for gods sake hurry my power plant
is dead now and i cant get any more pressure in
my safety tanks well be cracked like an egg shell
if you dont reach us soon were at  feet now
and still going down

  ill be alongside in five minutes returned jud-
son through his mouthpiece how much water are
you taking in

   dont know i think im full amidships was
the response my engineer had to run for it just
now he says the water is seeping in fast

  for a short while there was silence broken only by
the singing of my ears subjected for the first time
to the increasing air pressure of the compensating
tanks

  captain judson suddenly spoke into the communi-
cator ahoy bristol he cried can you muster
enough pressure around your intake pipe valves to
receive a pump line from us 

  lord no came the reply theres no chance
of your pumping my pressure wouldnt stay up for
ten minutes

  judson ground his teeth well what do you
expect me to do sink with you he paused mo-
mentarily and then youve turned down every-
thing ive suggested now this is my last word
im not going to attempt the saving of that tub of
yours she is completely gone anyway youve no
power and but little air and youre filling fast ill
take off your crew and thats all

  he ceased with an angrv snort and cut off our
power hie friction of the sea slowed us down
almost immediately and as we eased along i caught
sight of a long finger of metal shining in the beam
of our headlight

  it was the bristol she was settling by the stern
her bow at an angle of thirty degrees vainly pointing
toward the surface which her tireless crew had
fought so hard to gain she was going faster now
and only a few moments remained before she would
fall into that sickening dive from which there is no
recovery

  but our skipper brought us alongside with con-
summate skill as i looked out on the port side it
seemed that i could almost touch the great black
hull which descended nearer and nearer to our level
judson too gazed at the disabled submersible his
hand on the depth valve key which he turned with
a slow continuous motion keeping pace with the
sinking shell beside us

  then he nodded at larkin in the doorway i
dashed out to the passengers emergency port called
the p f aboard ship arriving just in time to see
two of the crew enter the little chamber before the
heavy hatch closed behind them i caught a glimpse
of their gigantic copper extreme-pressure suits

then as the steel cut them off from my vision the
outer hatch was opened and the sea entered the
chamber with a noise like thunder

  i held my breath while the dauntless two sought
the stanchions of the bristols emergency hatch

the  was worked forward ever so little but
always sinking sinking

abruptly captain judsons voice yelled into
the communicator weve got you weve got
you  quick  get your men aboard

  there was a faint answering roar of crashing
water then the whistle of compressed air in our
own chamber in a moment the inner hatch opened
and a dozen men staggered into view

  i turned again to the bridge with the intention of
congratulating captain judson for his fine work
but that old sailor was doubled up over his depth
valve key

  theyve got no more pressure he muttered half
to himself the skipper is alone-had to work the
valves for the others hes going to open his hatch

and try to drag himself against that deluge-

  suddenly there was a gurgling smash we looked
up quickly as the elevated bow of the bristol came
down opposite our windows the sight seemed to
freeze judson to immobility one hand on the depth
valve key the other on the throttle while he
watched during that breathless moment the bristol
hovered on an even keel and then with a quick lurch
her bow settled and the long black hull plunged
downward at the same moment a claxon sounded
discordantly and i was knocked to the floor by the
instantaneous jump of our ship as judson opened
wide the throttle but we were safe from the
dangerous suction and we had saved our man-
snatched him from the jaws of death

  the nervous tension over captain judson swore
softly at the loss of our lead gangplank which had
been torn from its runners by our sudden forward
lurch for freedom except for this slight outbreak
however everyone went about his work quietly and
as larkin took the bridge and began the long
gradual ascent to our cruising depth i turned to seek
my stateroom

  i must have slept heavily for when my first meal
was finished i saw the noon shift walking aft
toward the engine room i hurriedly walked in the
opposite direction mentally framing an excuse for
my laziness but when i reached the bridge there
was not a soul in sight to say i was puzzled would
hardly describe my sensation but as i pondered this
peculiar situation the truth dawned upon me-we
were on the surface that continuous sheet of
water beating against the glass was our bow spray
that bright light was the glorious sun

  i raced for the companionway leading to the after
deck and stumbled up the steps larkin at the
surface gear looked through his goggles at my
puzzled expression

  had to come up to make up our lost time he
explained were making  knots now

  indeed every appearance supported the truth of
the latter assertion although the sea was smooth
and the swell was hardly discernible the whole
forward portion of our deck was awash in the
stream of foam displaced by our piercing bows the
wind whistling through the surface gear burned
into my eyes and tugged at my clothing yes we
were indeed speeding and i wondered if our artificial
wind was much less than that created by the great
airship which passed over us just then some 
feet in the clouds

my reflections were cut short however by the

 crystals of growth

 charles h tzector

    then a shudder passed over his frame and before my eyes he commenced to increase in size    here before my eyes growth was
taking placc immediately it was almost unbelievable  he towered over me like a giant he grew so tall that his head touched the
ceiling try one yourself jameson he said and increase your size
crystals of growth



ie strange and extraordinary events
connected with our lives have always
been of exceptional interest to me and
even as a boy i was never more con-
tented than when  was reading some
good ghost story or examining some so-called
haunted house as i became older this liking for
mysterious things developed into a study and inves-
tigation of matters dealing with the psychic and
occult i have visited many spiritualistic seances
and have given reports concerning them to the public
through recent letters

  however i am not a fanatic on any of these sub-
jects and devote only a small portion of my time
to these pursuits for a well established law practice
engages me the major part of the time

  among the events which have happened during
my studies of psychic science there is one which
to me is most vivid something which has left a very
marked impression upon my mind  refer to pro-
fessor brontley and his theory of rapid growth
early last spring i became acquainted with the prom-
inent teacher and writer james h brontley whose
remarkable achievements in the field of biological
chemistry have won for him a wide-spread and well
deserved prominence professor brontley and i
became fast friends and i considered myself for
tunate to have the opportunity of knowing him so
well we would often sit for hours and converse
upon subjects of common interest

  one evening i sat in my chair musing before the
comfortable fire i had just finished my dinner and
was resting quietly thinking of the latest accomplish-
ments of my friend brontley me had confided to
me a short time previously that he was experiment-
ing upon a subject which if successfully attained
would secure not only personal fame for him but
would be a wonderful benefit to mankind he had
told me nothing of the nature of the experiment and
i was thinking of this particular thing wondering
when he would have something definite to say to me
about it when the door was suddenly opened and
the very person about whom i had been thinking
came into the room and dropped down in a chair
near me he looked exultant and excited and as
he shook my hand he burst
out

  jameson ive found it
at last and i have come
to tell you about it

  i looked at him in sur-
prise what did he mean 

i grasped him by the arm
and asked do you mean
that your latest experiment
has been successful you
mean the experiment that
you have been working on for the last six months

  thats the one its the greatest success of my
life and t want you to know about it first listen
he said as he shoved his chair closer to mine and
i will tell you all about it

  growth as you know in both the animal and
vegetable kingdom is the result of the digestion and
assimilation of the various elements and compound-
which the animal or plant obtains either through
food and drink or in the case of plants through the
absorption of fundamental elements from the soil
through the roots and tissues or from the air the

changes which take place are rather complex and
just at present are not of primary importance to the
subject which i wish to disclose to you

  as you are well aware he continued different
foods affect the body in various ways some foods
are more efficient than others we speak of this rela-
tive digestive value of foods as the coefficient of di-
gestibility which means in simple terms that a larger
percentage of some foods are digested than of others
some animals can utilize more fiber than others can
and some can make better use of the protein than
others i have some plants under observation in my
laboratory some of them fed on various kinds of
fertilizers while others have had no application
the difference in the growth and sturdiness of the
plants which received fertilizer over those which
did not is most marked you have often noticed
adjacent fields of corn one of which looked in all
respects better than the other this is an example
on a larger scale of the very thing which i have
tried out in my laboratory one field of corn had
more food elements available in the soil than the
other

  i nodded in affirmation loo interested to say a
word and he continued his narrative his dark pierc-
ing eyes fastened upon mine

unphe statements which i have made thus far
l are all perfectly natural facts obviously true
if one only takes the opportunity to look about him
in natures laboratory the great outdoors we take
it as a matter of fact that in youth we grow a few
inches taller and a few pounds heavier each year
but have you ever stopped to consider why this
growth should be comparatively slow

  the enormity of the suggestion almost paralyzed
me was the professor trying to change the order
of the universe i looked at him sharply appar-
ently he read the expression of doubt and wonder in
my face for he said sharply

  i know you wouldnt believe it but i have long
maintained that there must be some exceedingly con-
centrated form of food elements-some substance
in which the coefficient of digestibility is nearly per-
fect if not absolutely so i have long upheld the

belief that there must be
some food in which the
residue or indigestible part
is practically negligible if
one could find such a sub-
stance would it not be rea-
sonable to suppose that
he would derive a much
greater benefit from it
than from ordinary food

  i have been experi-
menting upon this subject
for a longtime and at last i have found it-a perfect
food which has the power of increasing ones height
and weight almost instantly no doubt you find it
difficult to believe but i can prove my statements
i want you to come to my laboratory with me and
witness a demonstration which will convince you
that t am no prevaricator

  i naturally agreed to accompany the professor to
his rooms for my curiosity had been aroused

  as we passed down one street after another i
found it difficult to keep up a conversation after
some monosyllabic answers i realized that my com-

 tlf iiat makes giants and what makes dwarfs
 rr scientists of today arc unanimous in the opinion
 that these conditions arc created by the thyroid gland
 if it were possible to systematically stimulate these
 glands there is no question but that a race of giants couhl
 be produced it is not at all impossible from a biological
 standpoint ami from experience gained in the laboratory
 wc know that it can be accomplished in crystals of
 growth the author spins an excellent tale


amazing stories

panion was engrossed in his own thoughts so i
walked along quietly beside him meanwhile wonder-
ing what surprises the evening had in store for me

  at last we halted before his home professor
brontley motioned to me to follow him and in a
moment we were ascending the stairs which led as
i assumed to his laboratory above i had never
been in his laboratory before and consequently i
was exceedingly anxious to see the place where all
of his wonderful discoveries had been made as
chummy as we were i had never had the oppor-
tunity of seeing the interior of this place probably
because of his desire for secrecy in regard to the
progress of certain tests which he was making at
any rate i knew that it was an important experiment
that would cause him to invite me inside of his
work-shop

  finally we reached the third story of the house
and stopped for a moment before a door which was
securely locked evidently the professor was tak-
ing precautions against unexpected visitors to this
particular room while he was away he drew a
string of keys from his pocket and after unlocking
the door he pushed a button in the wall and the
place was flooded with light i followed him into
the room and looked around

  it was an ordinary chemical laboratory such as
i had seen many times before containing various
sorts of apparatus which one usually finds in a place
of that kind the shelves along the side were
filled with bottles of different colored liquids and a
long table in the middle of the room was covered
with racks of test-tubes bunsen burners beakers
retorts flasks and other laboratory materials my
friend told me to seat myself and observe closely
everything that he did

i will attempt to narrate as accurately as pos-
sible everything which took place in the labora-
tory that night after putting on a rubber apron
my friend placed a pair of ordinary motor goggles
over his eyes he then took a large flask from the
shelf examined it closely and placed it  a tripod
following this act he removed from a rack before
him five different colored liquids from each of
these he measured an equal portion and poured it
into the large flask upon the tripod

  these five liquids represent a preparation of the
five most essential substances in our food he ex-
plained  he added nothing further and i did not
press him for additional details

  the next thing he did was to light the gas be-
neath the tripod and standing a short distance away
he watched with suspense the mixture within the
flask for a short time there was no apparent
change and then as the contents became warmer
there was a hissing sound accompanied presently bv
a crackling and snapping not unlike the snapping of
a wood fire the mixture was now boiling a
light curl of fumes issued from the neck of the
flask and there was a slightly pungent but not un-
pleasant odor noticeable in the room the professor
allowed it to boil for possibly two minutes and then
turned off the gas he stirred it slowly and then
dipped a piece of blue litmus paper into the flask
the paper turned red showing that there was an
acid reaction

  now for the last step announced my friend
and added a few drops of a light blue substance

from a bottle near by there was a sharp report
like a pistol shot and a shower of yellowish-brown
crystals fell upon a tray beneath the tripod my
friend carefully collected these crystals and then
turning to me he stated in an elated tone

  it is finished as i had planned and upon these
crystals in my hand depends the success of my ex-
periment you have witnessed a test of synthetic
or artificial digestion these crystals are the most
concentrated and efficient food substance known to
promote growth watch me and notice their
power

  the experience was too uncanny for description
i felt terror stricken as i watched him and had an
almost uncontrollable impulse to shout for the sheer
relief of my overtaxed nerves but by a supreme
effort of will i resisted the inclination

  he placed two of the crystals in his mouth and
swallowed them

  for perhaps five or six seconds no change was
apparent then a shudder passed over his frame
and before my very ayes he commenced to increase
in size you have probably been away from home
for some time and upon your return noticed the
increased stature of some young friends you re-
marked how much they had grown while you were
away but here before my naked eyes growth was
taking place immediately it was almost unbeliev-
able

  he soon towered over me like a giant he grew
so tall that his head touched the ceiling he began
to walk toward a chair and sat down suddenly he
stopped growing

  my height he said is now about twelve feet
a little more than double my former height if i
had wished to become still taller i could have done
so by taking more of the crystals think what a
relief these crystals will be to mankind no more
under-developed children no more short men and
short women tomorrow i shall show the world
that i am a living proof of the existence of a super-
food the crystals of growth try one yourself
jameson and increase your size

  thus speaking he offered one of the crystals to
me i was tempted to laugh at the preposterous
suggestion and then t looked at his face and realized
how serious the professor was i was horrified and
knew that with my friend in his present state of
super-elation at the result of his experiment-there
was an expression of mad fanaticism upon his face
-the situation demanded tact of the most delicate
nature if unpleasant and possibly fatal consequences
were to be avoided so i decided to humor him

  why brontley i evaded i dont need any of
your growth crystals im tall enough to suit me
and besides i know that they will do all that you
claim for them so whats the use

  in a second i realized that he was furiously angry
at my refusal to take the crystals he came towards
me and seized me by the shoulders you little
shrimp he sneered ill show you whether you
need them or not and he began to shake me i
strove to ward off his hold upon me but it was use-
less i was like a child in his grasp and it seemed as
though he would shake my head loose from my
shoulders my brain reeled the objects in the room
were becoming dim and seemted to be swimming
around me i seemed to be losing consciousness
crystals of growth



there were voices indistinct and mumbling in my
ears and then 

  whats the matter old man i found myself
on the floor in my room and looking up i saw the
face of my pal jack hudson gazing down at me
in perplexity ive been trying to wake you up for
the last three or four minutes he declared hurry
up or well be late for the show he added and then
whats the matter did you see a ghost

  when i had related my experience to my friend
he slapped me  the shoulder and told me that
hereafter  had better cut out rich pastry at night

  my friends claim that it was only a dream but i
know that there was a peculiar odor on my clothes

such as one associates with chemical laboratories
that my friend professor brontley disappeared on
the same evening on which i had my peculiar ex-
perience and that he has not been found since and
furthermore an examination of his laboratory after
his disappearance showed it to be exactly similar to
the one in which i had my memorable adventure
the articles in the laboratory were in a state of con-
fusion-bottles opened and broken chairs over-
turned and the room in general in a state of extreme
disorder the opinion of the majority of those
who examined the laboratory was that a violent
combat of some nature had taken place but the
crystals of growth were nowhere in evidence

the undersea express

 by j rodman

   concluded from page 

appearance of a blue haze in the distance land
it became more distinct with each passing second
but just as i was beginning to watch for land-
marks  the distant cliffs the word was given to
go below there  watched larkin dive our ship into
the depths and lay a course for the channel lights
soon began to appear-red green and white some
flashing others unblinking continuous-forming a
pattern so complex and confusing that i wondered
how a human being could guide us through the
maze

  true to form old judson strode in to watch with
narrowed eyes the actions of his protege among the
lights

  the red lights are shoals and rocks he ex-
plained for my benefit the first one we passed was
wolfe rock yes the white lights indicate a city
though there are exceptions to the rule thats the
falmouth light directly opposite theres no subma-
rine channel in falmouth  subs have to enter the har-
bor on the surface that double white light off in the
distance is the entrance to the plymouth channel

  i became intensely interested in this submerged
galaxy and the time passed so quickly that it seemed
but a moment before we had rounded the green
and white blinkers of ramsgate and begun to bear
down on the steady glow of the chatham beacon
we slowed down for the entrance of the chatham
channel but once within its confines larkin kept
the speed indicator hovering around  knots we
glided swiftly past the submerged docks of chatham
and soon approached the brilliantly lighted passages
beneath london when we reduced our speed again
i caught sight of the unmistakable lamps of the ex-
press company landing and as larkin eased us into
our berth and the bumper side-clips snapped shut i
knew the journey was ended

  i said good-bye to larkin and his chief in the
passenger elevator so that upon reaching the street
level i immediately stepped out upon the crowded
thoroughfare a clock on picadilly registered four
oclock less three minutes and i knew then that
captain judson had saved the  guarantee
and the crew of the bristol as well

 and there was that maniac russian over there
 ready to spring upon me he glared at me with
 lips curlea back from gritted teeth i seethed

 and stole toward grant ray fingers clutching
 spasmodically to get hold of his throat


the riot at saxderac



sshe courts have started their slow blun-
dering grind at sanderac
mkssrii first there came the newspaper head-
jnes screanljng the shocking news over
 the country the next day the columns
went into details concerning the unaccountable out-
break of rioting in the little mining city nearly two
hundred dead buildings burned property destroyed
and no one knew the cause the nation stood
aghast because the perpetrators of the ferocious
massacre were those who had until then been solid
and respectable citizens

  i happened to have been there when it occurred

i told my story i was scoffed at and received no
attention the courts continue to grope ineffectually
about in circles how futile they seem

  the town is built about the mine head its popu-
lation is about half american half foreign labor
among the latter is a colony of russian refugees
largely marxian communists or as we know them
soviet bolsheviks their meetings were watched by
the police and some vague ridiculous rumors started
that they planned organizing a soviet right there on
lake superior but no one took it seriously on
the whole the bolsheviks lived harmoniously with
the five thousand americans even the refugees be-
longing to the russian aristocracy and intelligentsia
got along very well with the reds such is the level-
ing influence of americanism

  i was visiting an engineer friend of mine at san-
derac this was my first visit to grant since our
college days at the boston tech he had gone
straightto the mine job while i had a government
position which took me all over the country i still
remembered grant as a fellow of uncanny ingenuity
as well as ridiculous ab-
sent-mindedness he was	-	- -
overjoyed to see me made
me put up at his home and
took me all over the town
-the town which has now
become so famous

  i have often won-
dered i said to him at
dinner why as brilliant a
man as you are is willing
to bury himself here out
of sight i looked forward
to your accomplishing
some sensational thing in
the world

  well you may not be
so far wrong at that

grant said with a smile
that seemed to indicate he
wasnt telling everything

this is an ideal position
for me not much work
lots of leisure plenty of
money im working on
things of my own you

see	

  i knew then that he had
some sensational plan worked out from that
moment on i gave him no rest until he had started
out to tell me about it i hurried myself and him
through the rest of the meal grant took me out to
a concrete shack near his building at the mine works

  it was heavily locked within was a workshop

from the looks of the tools and the small parts it
was evident that he was working on some delicate
electrical stuff a smooth-shaven sad-looking man
of about fifty bent over a bench was working on
some things strung full of green-insulated wires

  this is sergei my assistant grant said intro-
ducing me sergeis face showed refinement and
intelligence his courtesy was of the european type
which americans so admire but cannot imitate he
moved away to turn on more lights

  queer fellow grant said in an undertone he
wont even associate with the other russians used
to be a musician the bolsheviks killed all his
family

  for a moment i was more interested in the rus-
sian than in the machine but he was now bent over
a table studying a blue-print and putting pieces to-
gether there was a sort of hopeless droop about
him yet he worked swiftly and with marvelous skill

  here we are explained grant this is what
ive spent the last ten years on

  whats it supposed to be i inquired it doesnt
suggest a thing to my mind

  there was a semi-circular keyboard like those 
large pipe-organs the rest of it was built up into
a sort of a cabinet with bulbs instead of organ-
pipes it was something like an exaggerated and
caricatured radio sending set there were scores of
the bulbs globular pear-shaped gourd-like flask-
shaped and of all sizes from that of an egg to one
as big as a pumpkin grant moved a switch the
complex array of bulbs filled with a pale white glow

  they look as though they might be electron-
tubes i remarked is it some form of musical
instrument

                 no not exactly sit
                 - down grant was elated

 so while i found a
chair he took his place on
the bench in front of the
organ thing i le ran his
fingers around over the
keys i stared at him in
surprise not a sound
camc from the instrument
was it some effect of light
or color that i should look
for  i looked closely but
the bulbs glowed quite un-
changed was he out of
his mind not knowing
what else to do i sat and
waited patiently

 i sat bowed forward
with my chin leaned on
my hand and my elbows
on my knees grants
movements at the silent
machine became monot-
onous and depressing the
dingy concrete walls were
	unutterably gray the

                      gloomy interior of the
shack made me think of some graveyard of human
desires even the futile wires sprawled all about gave
a mournful impression i grew so lonesome and dis-
couraged that i could feel the muscles of my face
droop and sag grant failure of a fellow that he was
seemed somehow ragged and dismal as he lugubri-

   jlt usic we are told charms individuals not only
 v humans if you have ever seen a hindu charm
 a snake by means of his flute you will understand what

 tinctly grates on our nerves there are certain pieces
 of music certain sounds that arouse savage instincts in
 most of us as is well known if von ever listened to a

 mean too but there is music there arc sounds which arc
 no longer heard by the ear as such where the vibra-
 tions go beyond some  thousand per second the ear
  longer perceives them as sounds yet the sounds are
 there quite loud as a matter of fact recently for
 instance mr  ago gernsback editor of this publica-
 tion performed certain experiments at station ivrny
 where the audibility of the audience was tested by means
 of an audio frequency oscillator the particular oscil-
 lator used produced audible vibrations from a frequency
 of  up to over  cycles per second it was found
 that beyond  vibrations per second most people
 could hear nothing it was interesting howeicr that
 a number of listeners reported strange effects noted on
 various animals some dogs and canaries seemed to be
 able to hear so while the loud speaker was silent to
 human beings it was noisy enough to disturb certain
 animals

   a similar theme is used in the present story which
 not only contains excellent science but is an exceptional
 scientifiction story as well

ously pawed the keys i watched the heavy smoke
drag across the square of leaden sky visible through
he window in the same way that my useless sbul was
drifting across a colorless and dreary world the
only place for me was at home with my mother my
mother of the white apron and sunny hair who made
gingersnaps for me but my mother was dead

  grant stopped his activity at the keys and turned
around he looked at me intently for a long time
then he turned around and started playing again on
that dumb futile keyboard

  he danced around on his seat like a clown like
a travesty of paderewski he crooked his fingers in-
to claws and brought them down wildly on the keys
and then ran them through his ruffled hair his
knees worked comically up and down as he manipu-
lated some sort of pedals he looked so silly that
i was forced to smile then i leaned back and
laughed i laughed at him and at the funny little
zig-zag wires on the bench near me like wiggling
rats tails and at the comical shapes assumed by the
wisps of smoke outside the foolish little window
the back of sergei bent over his work was like a
hump on the back of some droll camel it made me
laugh till i rocked the whole adventure up on the
mountainside with a coal-mine below and a cracked
inventor pounding  an organ that wouldnt work
was all so inexpressibly funny that i laughed till i
was hoarse

grant was sitting motionless again gazing
fixedly at me as my laughing died down he
turned again to the keys

  he played slowly if i could call it playing since
i heard nothing the crazy fellow trying to de-
ceive me that way i grew impatient at hinr did
he think  was a fool  i had a strong notion to tell
him what i thought of him and his abortive inven-
tion his slowness was irritating i knew he was
doing it to tantalize me i felt like giving him a shove
and knocking him off the seat-and kicking him into
a corner my lists clenched and my biceps tightened
why had he brought me into this barred and locked
stone cell full of poisons and dangerous currents
and there was that maniac russian over there
ready to spring upon me and kill me unawares the
coward  i looked at him he straightened up and
glared at me with lips curled back from gritted teeth
i seethed with rage against both of them ive got
to get them both out of my way before i can escape
grant first i stood up and stole toward him my
fingers clutching spasmodically to get hold of his
throat i wanted to maul him to break his bones-

  he whirled around and saw me his hand shot
out and moved a switch the glow in the bulbs died
out a sudden limpness went through me my knees
went weak and i collapsed on the floor now every-
thing was peace i was myself again wondering
what had been happening tp me

  slowly it dawned on me that grants playing
must have had something to do with these storms
of emotion

   sat up sergei was sitting in a chair pale and
clutching a bench

  that last effect was foolish of me grant was
saying you might have beaten me up before i
realized what was happening my own fault

  i stood up feeling much better physically grant
was again the same old good-natured absent-minded

scientific child sergei also walked away in deferent
silence he didnt look fierce at all only humble
and quiet and very much a gentleman think of it
a concert musician now at a menial job and a wife
and two girls murdered by bolsheviks

  narrow escape i had grant laughed again as
i stared around unable to find words and poor
old sergei was on his way out to clean up his bol-
shevik neighbors

  whats this i finally demanded whats
been happening to me

  you will admit that it affected you powerfully
grant smiled

  ill say it did it nearly drove me crazy what
is it how is it done tell me quick or ill get
you yet

  when i explain grant warned you will be
disappointed at the simplicity of it

  im waiting to be

  you know well he began that emotions are
purely physical states produced by the activity of
the ductless or endocrine glands stimulation of the
suprarenal produces rage that of the thyroid fear
and anxiety that of the gonads love and so forth
warm up the gland increase the amount of its secre-
tion and the emotion follows by mixtures and
combinations an endless chain of emotions may be
produced that is well established knowledge

  old stuff i agreed

  the next step is that the operation of the body
cells is merely a matter of the exchange of electrical
charges secretion nerve action muscle contraction
all you do is merely a movement of electrons from
here to there

  nothing new or startling about that so far i
commented

  the rest isnt so old i figured that instead of
waiting till the exchange of electrons in the body
takes place by chance impulse and accidental com-
binations of perceptive stimulation i would make
them for you at will by shooting electrons at you
out of my vacuum tubes the numbers velocities
and quantity-rates of discharge of negative electrons
and various varieties of positive ions determine
whether it is your suprarenal or your pituitary that
is warmed up your body obeys cant help itself
it is simple i admitted but it is uncanny i
certainly felt real emotions

  they were real emotions and i had a real one
too when i saw you coming-i was scared

  i sat down to think over the astounding thing
he had sat up there and played on keys and made
me feel as i did and since feeling controls action
-that man had an instrument that could make people
do anything he had the world at his beck

  you just got here in time he was saying in a
most matter-of-fact voice we were about to begin
taking the machine apart and moving it to a theater
i want to give a public performance

  tn fact sergei was already taking out the electron
tubes and packing them in cotton-lined cartons

  id like to see that i said eagerly my mind full
of interesting possibilities when does it come
off

  by all means come that will be an excuse for
you to remain with me for a few days i am plan-
ning the show for next friday sergei can almost
handle the moving alone so you and i can have lots
of time together for my work at the mine is light
the riot at sanderac



grants advertising for his public perform-
ance was very modest i was afraid that he
would not have much of an audience he announced
in the newspaper and on billboards that he had a
scientific discovery for influencing emotions in a new
way without the medium of pictures music words
or other common means something different he
told me that he did not care to have a big crowd for
the first performance

  but the house was packed full grants towns-
people apparently knew him and expected something
worth while the buzz of excitement through the
theater swelled and waned in rhythmic waves as the
people sat and looked at the organ keys and the
assortment of odd-shaped bulbs the theater was
full people continued to crowd in and there were
more people outside and still grant had not arrived

  he had tested out the machine in the afternoon
and had waited eagerly for the evening then at
 p m he had been called to the power-house
at the mine where a safety-valve of a loaded boiler
had jammed now it was  and the densely
packed audience shuffled impatiently and broke out
into occasional bursts of clapping to encourage them-
selves

  at  a messenger arrived from grant with a
note sergei who had been hovering anxiously
about the machine took it glanced at itj and handed
it to me the note was addressed to me

  bad job here it read i dont know whom else
to ask and therefore i should like to have you get up
and explain to the audience what the situation is
tell them that i shall be back in an hour they
may go out and return in an hour if they wish
grant

  facing an audience has always been unpleasant to
me even for such a trifling matter as this- it took
me some minutes to screw up my courage but even-
tually i was in front of them

  the people looked queer their eyes were big
and glaring they sat up rigid everyones teeth
showed in an ugly snarl here were the towns best
people business and professional men whom i had
previously met well dressed women as good a
group as one could see in any city but now they
looked like some savage beasts

  then suddenly i understood a glance backward
had shown me sergei seated at the keys his body
swaying his fingers busy every inch a musician i
gave one more terrified glance at the audience peo-
ples arms jerked convulsively one by one they
were leaping fiercely to their feet and surging for-

ward i was desperately afraid for my own safety
and i turned and led across the stage and out of the
rear door

  i ran-something i was not accustomed to do i
puffed and my head throbbed i ran for the power-
house where grant was working on the jammed
safety valve an overloaded boiler was less danger-
ous than this fiercely aroused audience the uproar
of shouting and trampling behind me lent speed to
my clumsy progress

  i began to feel relieved when i saw the boiler-
house in front of me why i do not know for what
could grant do then the boiler house acted
queerly it bulged outwards the tall chimney stack
bent in the middle like a knee and seemed to hang
that way for an interminably long time there was
a great spout of steam and a terrible boom that rev-
erberated and roared for several minutes before
me was a vast cloud of steam out of which black
objects flew high in all directions some of them
seemed to be men

  i stopped behind me the clamor of shouting
and trampling was increasing i looked back and
saw flames shooting high in the air from the theater
building a mob of infuriated people was running
surging pouring through the streets brandishing
things terror possessed me which way should i
run

  however i soon noted that they were not after
me they turned and flowed to my left toward the
mountainside i stared at them amazed for a
while in the mean time shots and screams and
hideous thuds came from the section on the mountain
slope where the russian miners lived flames shot
up here and there the attack had fallen on the
bolshevik quarter which was being swiftly wiped
out

  for a moment i stood frozen in my tracks then
i dragged myself to the garage where i kept my car
i dashed out of that place in the twilight without
a hat without my baggage-without my mind al-
most

  now the courts are foolishly blunderingly gro-
ping around trying to fix the blame they have
scores of citizens in prison-perfectly innocent citi-
zens i tried to tell them of grants instrument and
of sergei who was amusician and whose wife and
daughters were horribly murdered by bolsheviks
but i was only told that i had not been called as a
witness and if my testimony was required i would
be notified

verything material is visible i
stated flatly

  pardon me for disagreeing with
you boomed a deep sonorous voice
behind me

   i swung around in astonishment and with a touch
of asperity to stare into a pair of humorous wide-
set and large blue eyes behind gold-rimmed spec-
tacles

  the owner of the eyes nodded pleasantly and
smiled in a quiet friendly way that immediately at-
tracted me to him

  i can prove my assertion in a way that will con-
vince you he continued with quiet assurance but
without the least touch of dogmatism

in this manner  became acquainted with profes-
sor carl winter phd it happened in dorans
book store and doran himself with whom i had
been conversing introduced us

  quite a conversation ensued between the professor
and me and when at last we parted i had promised
at his urgent request to visit him at my earliest con-
venience little dreaming of the strange amazing ad-
venture that my promise would lead to

  it was about two weeks before i was able to keep
my promise professor winter lived on the out-
skirts of town in an old-fashioned brick residence
of two stories surrounded by an extensive garden
and shaded by a great number of magnificent oak
and chestnut trees

  an old man-servant whose name-as i later
learned-was carl summer admitted me he was
cook and general factotum to the scientist who was
a widower and childless the queer coincidence of
their similar given names and the diametrically
opposite meaning of their surnames made me smile
when i came to think of it

  i found the professor in his very completely
equipped laboratory examining something in a large
test tube

  come in come in mister barton he cried
cheerfully i am certainly glad to see you i am
sure he added as we shook hands

  having taken the comfortable chair at the table
that he indicated i leaned
back and gazed at my host

  he was a large man
well over six feet tall and
built in proportion his
brilliant blue eyes were in-
dicative of the scientist
searching penetrating and
analytical his broad
high brow bulging at the
temples denoted not only
the student and thinker
but also the idealist and
dreamer his straight nose strong mouth and firm
jaw proclaimed him a man of energy and deter-
mination however the fce as a whole was ex-
pressive of kindness sympathy and warm humanity

  til spite of his age which was somewhere between
fifty and sixty his hair was still blond except for
a tinge of gray at the temples

  he pointed to a large open volume written by an
eminent authority on physics which lay at my el-
bow on the table and his voice was vibrant with
energy as he spoke

  referring back to the conversation we had the
other day at dorans i wish that you would kindly
read the article i have marked while i with your
permission am completing this test

  when i nodded aquiescence he added

  i am quite certain that the article will serve to
elucidate some of the points i advanced during our
conversation at that time

  i smiled i certainly do need a great deal of
light on certain things and i am always willing to
learn

  i congratulate you upon your attitude he said
cordially

  i adjusted the book in question upon my knees
and read the following interesting postulate

  while vibration ceases to affect our senses at

	vibrations per second as sound we find our-
selves conscious again of periodic motion when it
reaches  trillion times per second then we hear
with our eyes or see with our ears whichever you
choose the sensation is in all cases the effect of
motion

  there is much food for thought or speculation
in the thought that there exist sound-waves that no
ear can hear and color-waves that no eye can see
the to us long dark soundless space between

	and  trillions and the infinity of range
beyond  trillions where light ceases in the uni-
verse of motion makes it possible to indulge in the
speculation that there may be beings who live in

different planes from ourselves and who are
endowed with sense-organs like our own only
they are tuned to hear and see in a different
sphere of motion

 stopped reading and put the book down
thoughtfully very interesting i commented
but what is the idea

  the professor turned and gazed at me quizzically
did you note the part printed in capitals he
questioned

  i nodded yes in fact i read that part of the
sentence twice

  well what do you think of that

  i shook my head dubiously i am inclined to
think that the eminent
scientists imagination ran
away with him

  professor winter smiled
in a peculiar manner and
his eyes shone brilliantly
through his spectacles
ah so you think that
there is no possibility of
an invisible world around
us 

  w-e-e--i would not
say impossible because the
progress of modern science seems to demonstrate
that we can hardly presume to draw the line between
the possible and the impossible but at least i would
consider the matter highly improbable and alto-
gether inconceivable

  for a few minutes the professor silently busied
himself with his chemical apparatus then he
turned to me again and there was an intense feel-
ing in his manner and voice when he spoke

  my dear fellow what would you say if i were
to tell you that i am upon the point of making the

 j t ere is a different sort of story one that we in-
 -ll stinctively know the larger proportion of our read-
 ers will accept enthusiastically the old idea that there
 are other planes upon which beinys exist has been ex-
 ploited by many authors but it comes to the front again
 in a totally different manner this time the story is
 brimful of adventure and exciting interest combined with
 excellent science and tvill hold you spellbound to the end
 incidentally the vibration theory put forth in this story
 is quite good besides being plausible as well


amazing stories

seemingly impossible a reality if i were to tell you
that i am about to perfect a machine which will en-
able me to penetrate into that world of vibration
and matter that i feel certain exists below the plane
of the infra-red

   laughed amusedly if you were to tell me that
i would no doubt conclude that you were joking
he smiled gravely and nodded i would hardly
blame you

  then he seated himself in a chair close by and
leaned toward me as he continued nevertheless
such are the facts my experiments are nearly fin-
ished and i am about to step into that unknown
world furthermore i would like to have a skeptic
like yourself share the experience with me

  i stared at him aghast i could not believe that
i had heard aright finally i burst out with man
alive do you mean that you are in earnest  and
that you have actually and scientifically discovered
a way to see hear and otherwise sense the invisible
and intangible

  he nodded quietly yes i mean just that-
wait he raised his hand as i was about to remon-
strate again he pointed to the still open book
which i had placed upon the table and continued
as you have read in that book the highest speed
of vibration which the auditory apparatus of man
is capable of registering is forty thousand vibrations
per second above that the ear is incapable of hear-
ing anything why  because the vibrations become
too rapid to affect the tympanum and chain of bones
of the middle ear in other words they cease to be
sound as far as the human ear is concerned

  now it is a well-known fact that some animals
can hear sounds plainly which the finest attuned
human ear is unable to register what does that
prove it evidently proves a finer adjustment or
attunement as you will

  but at the other the higher end of the scale
we find that the lowest vibrations of light which the
human visual apparatus is able to perceive is the
color of red the deepest shade of it that vibrates
at the rate of  trillions per second below that
the eye is unable to distinguish motion of any kind

  you must admit that the space between forty
thousand and  trillions is tremendous incon-
ceivable can you really believe that this great space
in nature is without motion or vibration of any sort 
does it appear reasonable or logical to you that there
should be such a waste in creation 

  nature abhors a vacuum you know that as
well as  do as far as science has been able to
determine there is something everywhere there
is no emptiness anywhere in the universe

  so now with these facts in mind i want you
to listen carefully to what we are going to do you
and i

  for several minutes while i gazed at him in fasci-
nation he sat there in deep thought at last he
resumed

  taking all these facts into consideration i quite
a while ago conceived the idea that if it were pos-
sible to raise or increase the sensitiveness of the
human auditory apparatus sufficiently then the
field of audible vibrations could be vastly extended

   at the extreme other end on the plane of color
vibrations i conceived in a similar manner that if
it were possible to attune the visual organs to re-
spond to a longer wave-length then the vibrations

below the infra-red could be perceived and naturally

also the things belonging to that plane

  consequently i began to experiment until my
idea assumed concrete form and i conceived an
apparatus part electrical and part chemical by
means of which both the auditory and occular organs
of man could be caused to vibrate artificially in such
manner as to become sensitive to the required wave-
length

  after many experiments and much expenditure
of patience energy and money i finally attained the
right results my machine is about completed now
and i shall soon have the pleasure of inviting you
to share with me the most original adventure that
could be imagined

he sprang excitedly to his feet i know that
such an invisible world exists he cried with
hashing eyes i feel it-my intuition tells me so
and by heaven-i am going to prove it he fin-
ished with a vehement gesture

  i sat there as if in a trance a great fantastic
world of possibilities had opened up before me the
logical manner in which professor winter had
ranged fact on fact had broken down the barrier of
prejudice and skepticism in my mind to such an ex-
tent that i almost admitted to myself the possibility
-absurd and fantastic as it seemed-of the scien-
tists scheme

  could such a thing be really possible  could the
organs of sight and hearing be really attuned in
such a way as to make visible and audible a hereto-
fore unknown world in the universe of matter the
idea fascinated me gradually to such an extent that
it was with a distinct effort that i aroused myself

  i recovered to find my host regarding me with a
humorous twinkle in his eyes i see that the skeptic
is not quite so sure of his ground he commented

  i laughed i admit that your logic is very con-
vincing and plausible but just the same im from
missouri and you will have to show me 

  he nodded energetically and you shall be
shown i assure you just as soon as my machine is
completed

it was about ten days later in the early part of
the morning the telephone bell rang it seemed
to me a bit violently professor winter was at the
other end of the wire and i noticed subdued excite-
ment and tension in his voice when he spoke

  can you come at once he inquired

  i think i can is it important

  his laugh a trifle strained came to me im-
portant  well rather and you had better come
prepared to stay all day and the night too i think

  when i hung up the instrument a sudden excite-
ment took possession of me and my hands trembled
as i packed my things into a bag i knew that the
great adventure was just ahead

  again summer admitted me when i arrived at
the professors house but this time i noticed that
his face wore a very troubled expression without
a word he took my bag and led the wav

  i found the professor in his laboratory pacing
up and down his face lighted up when i entered

  ah  mister barton  you have really come-i was
a little afraid that you might change your mind

  i laughed a little nervously well to tell the
truth professor i did have half a notion to excuse
below the infra red



myself but-my curiosity got the better of me
and here i am

  he smiled i would have been very disappointed
if you had not come

  i gazed searchingly about the laboratory do
you mean to say that you are really ready to try
the experiment now and that you are ready to
enter into the mysteries of the hypothetical world
below the vibrations of the infra-red 

  he nodded gravely and turned toward the library
with a brief please come this way

  now that things were really coming to a climax
i felt very much like the little boy in the ante-room
of the dentist when he is about to have a tooth
pulled however i followed my host into the spa-
cious library adjoining the laboratory and saw a
strange sight

  in the very center of the great room the window
shades of which were closed two large armchairs
were standing side by side almost touching each
other at the outer side of each chair was placed
a strong table of oak and steel covered with a mass
of shining apparatus

  the most conspicuous thing on each of the tables
was a heavy hollow base of burnished steel about
two and one-half feet long two feet wide and one
foot or thereabouts high

  the polished steel base was bolted to the heavy
oaken planks of the table top and was surmounted
by a strong steel frame in the form of a lateral cross
supported by four steel columns

  each of these columns was about sixteen inches
high and securely connected to the heavy cross piece
at the top this frame formed the support of two
large spheres of metal each about twelve inches in
diameter one of them seemed composed of bur-
nished copper the other appeared to be made of
a silver-like metal

  these spheres were each connected to a heavy
vertical shaft of steel which passed through the cen-
ter the lower ends of these shafts passed down
into the interior of the steel bases while the upper
end of each was supported in a ball-bearing in the
cross piece on top

  two slightly smaller sized stationary glass globes
were attached to each of the heavy supporting col-
umns at the long ends of the cross by means of felt-
padded metal clamps in close proximity to the near-
est of the center metal spheres

  the globe nearest to the copper sphere contained
a transparent liquid of a beautiful emerald hue
the one next to the silvery sphere held a mixture
of the color of ruby

  from each one of the two metal supporting clamps
of the glass spheres heavy insulated flexible wires
ran to the arm chairs

  upon the seat of each chair lay a strong head-
dress of leather resembling an aviators cap the
wires from the glass sphere containing the green
liquid terminated at the sides of the cap where the
ears would be the wires from the globe with the
ruby fluid led to heavy goggles at the front part of
the hoods these goggles were of a peculiar con-
struction and contained double lenses with a space
between them

  professor winter pointed to the apparatus and
explained

  to describe the entire apparatus and its operation
would perhaps be too technical for your lik-

ing and would take too long the essential points
are these in the base of the machine is the highest
speed rotary engine in the world-my own inven-
tion it is operated by electricity the office of the
apparatus is to change the vibration of both the
auditory and occular organs to such degree simul-
taneously that they will be sensitive to the vibra-
tions below the infra-red plane

  the machines on both tables are identical ex-
cept that the controlling switchboard for both is
located on my side

  he pointed to one of the chairs to the right arm
of which was attached a small board with a number
of electrical contact buttons and to which a bun-
dle of insulated wires was brought from the base
of each machine

  i nodded only half understanding what the pro-
fessor was saying are you sure that everything
will turn out all right  i inquired dubiously

  i anticipate no trouble at the worst nothing
can happen to our physical bodies they will be
safe in this room and summer will watch outside
the door anything that we might see or otherwise
sense can not affect our physical well-being

  i see i said but of course i did not well
then- i continued- if you think that everything
is as it should be i would suggest that we start be-
cause i confess that i am getting slightly nervous
after all--this is quite an undertaking

  professor winter nodded seriously yes you
are right and you can never know how i appreciate
your cooperation in this adventure

  he held out his hand and we shook hands earnestly 
with very mixed feelings i sat down in the chair
that my host indicated just relax your body and
your mind and you will feel better he advised
while he adjusted the leathern cap to my head

  a few moments later he had fastened on his own
headgear with a cordial motion he waved his
hand to me and touched one of the buttons

  immediately a high musical note was audible i
gazed toward the apparatus at my left the copper
sphere was whirling madly and the emerald fluid
in the adjoining glass globe seemed to become in-
tensely illuminated

  the musical note rose higher and higher so that
it seemed to tax the auditory organs to the utter-
most questioningly i turned toward the professor
he was just in the act of pressing another button
and immediately the white metal spheres on our
respective tables began to revolve with inconceivable
rapidity

  it seemed as if a thin fog was beginning to en-
velop the objects in the room the fog-like phe-
nomenon was getting momentarily more dense the
strong electric lights of the library seemed to be-
come gradually dimmer and dimmer until they ap-
peared like the headlights of an automoible through
a very dense fog

  it was getting darker and darker every moment
now the scientist at my side was hardly visible
and then suddenly the most absolute darkness that
can be imagined enveloped us like a heavy mantle

  temporarily alarmed i reached out my hand and
touched the professor immediately i felt his re-
assuring pat on my arm i was greatly relieved
evidently everything was as it should be with
hammering pulse i awaited further developments


amazing stories

there-was it imagination due to my over-
strained senses-there seemed to be a faint
violet light permeating the stygian darkness

  the violet light was certainly getting stronger
my senses had not deceived me then i waited ex-
citedly for-i knew not what

  suddenly i became aware of another phenomenon
the high musical sound after taxing my auditory
nerve to its uttermost had completely ceased and-
i was almost certain that i heard a faint sound as of
distant singing

  i was now in a fever of expectancy i felt intui-
tively that some wonderful development was immi-
nent the violet light was getting brighter and
brighter and in about the same ratio it seemed that
the singing sound as of a multitude was increasing
in volume also

  what was happening were we really passing to
another plane of existence was the experiment of
professor winter about to be successful with
ever nerve tingling i waited

  all that was now visible was that peculiar fog-like
phenomenon lighted up with the soft violet light
the rest was emptiness i gazed over toward my
companion but could see nothing of him either i
seemed to be on a lonely island in a violet sea

  and then-as if through many curtains of violet
gauze i saw all about me it seemed the semi-nude
figures of gigantic men and women

  suddenly everything was quite clear and i gazed
upon the strangest spectacle-

  i seemed to be in a vast cathedral-like place so
vast was it that i could not perceive the top of it
in the dense violet shadows above me nor could
my vision penetrate to the walls that i instinctively
felt were on either side of me

  great columns of what seemed to be purple-col-
ored metal brilliantly polished rose upward into
the unfathomable heights forming wide aisles on all
sides of me i seemed to be in the very center of
the widest of these aisles

  straight down this great main-aisle in the direc-
tion toward which i was facing and at what might
be the end of it i saw an immense altar-like struc-
ture of some material which at this distance ap-
peared to be white alabaster

  broad wide steps led to the top of this structure
which was formed by a wide platform covered above
by a great semi-spherical baldachin of what appeared
to be blue crystal

  under this crystal dome two great golden chairs
wrere placed side by side and seated upon them
i perceived two human figures-a man and a woman

  about and in front of this throne and on all sides
as far as the eyes could see a great multitude of
people were gathered thousands they seemed to
be of such physical perfection as to remind me of
the fabled gods and goddesses of ancient greece

  very tall they were-all of them i judged the
men to be at least seven feet in height and the
women about six the faces of both were beautiful
and hairless their coloring an exquisite white and
rose their hair which the women wore long and
unrestrained and the men down to their necks was
of every shade of blond and of a fine wavy texture

  their heads were crowned with chaplets of gor-
geous fragrant flowers and garlands of the same
flowers adorned their bodies with the exception
of very broad loin-cloths of vari-colored shiny

material of fine texture the men were nude the
women were arrayed in a sort of simple sleeveless
tunic supported from the shoulders by narrow
straps of the same material ag the men wore

  they all stood erect with arms upraised above
their heads facing the two upon the throne and
they sang an anthem of such wonderful exquisite
harmony and volume and such liquid clear tone
as i would never have believed existed in the world
of sound

 glanced toward professor winter whom i
had nearly forgotten for a moment i was ter-
ribly afraid because i could not see him suddenly
one of his explanations came to my mind i gazed
down at my own body and-as i expected-saw
nothing

  it was a strange eerie teeling i seemed to con-
sist of nothing but brain to all intents and pur-
poses i was an invisible being even to myself but
a few moments of reflection reassured me ap-
parently professor winters experiment was a per-
fect success a monument as it were to his genius
as far as my senses were concerned i was on the
sub-infra-red plane though my physical body was
on the earth plane it was in truth a most fantastic
situation

  to reassure myself beyond doubt i felt toward
him with my invisible hand and to my great relief
touched his body he gave my hand a reassuring
squeeze to indicate that everything was in order

  naturally i thought as long as the machine in
the professors library was running and our visual
and auditory organs therefore were tuned to a vastly
different vibration we could not possibly hear or
see each other as an experiment  shouted but
 heard not the slightest sound

  it was a marvellous experiment and an amazing
experience and i was conscious of deep gratitude
to the scientist for having given me the opportunity
of sharing it with him

  we must have been invisible to the sub-infra-red
people also because those immediately surrounding
us gave not the slightest sign of noting anything out
of the ordinary

  the singing ceased the people lowered their arms
and gazed expectantly toward the great throne

  presently amidst absolute silence the two beings
on the throne whom i judged to be the rulers of
these people rose from their seats came to the outer
edge of the throne platform and faced the audience
and even at that distance i realized that physically
they were superior even to any of their own sub-
jects

  the man wore a sort of tunic of white shining
cloth which came almost to his knees and was sus-
pended by a strap of gold from his left shoulder
leaving his right breast free upon his broad chest
an emblem in the shape of two outspread wings
glittered and scintillated with every movement of
his perfect body

  his companion ruler wore a similar sleeveless
tunic but suspended from both shoulders and drop-
ping just below the knees and upon her perfectly
rounded bosom glittered a similar emblem of double
wings their feet like those of their people were
bare and they also had adorned themselves with
the beautiful strange flowers

  i watched continued to watch them fascinated
below the infra red



each one raised the right hand with the palm out-
ward and placed the left hand over the heart and
while they stood thus they sang a duet of such har-
mony and perfect symphony that i was completely
entranced

  in some mysterious manner their singing suddenly
became intelligible to me through some marvellous
process of the mind i was able to receive telepathi-
cally the thoughts they meant to convey without
knowing the language itself

  our language is very crude compared to the per-
fect song-language of the sub-infra-red people but
the following is approximately what they the rulers
conveyed

  beloved people in the name of the ruler of the
visible and invisible universe welcome

  this day which marks an illuminated period in
the cycle of our reign beloved brothers and sisters
fills our hearts and minds with great happiness for
it has proven to us anew the strong divine- bands
of the affection which unites us all together into one
people one family

  and it shall ever be our greatest task and sin-
cerest endeavor to continue with you in the same
happy harmonious relationship receive therefore
our blessing and vibrations of affection for your
devotion and fidelity and let us ask also for the
blessing of him who rules the universe

  with that they raised both hands heavenward and
together with the people who followed their example
they sang a short but rousing anthem of gratitude

  an ecstatic silence of some minutes followed the
singing as the people and their rulers stood there
with arms still upraised and faces expressing joy-
ful gladness and hope

  suddenly a peculiar feeling came over me i felt
that i was gradually rising out of my physical body
it was an indescribable sensation it seemed that
i the soul was slipping out of my invisible physical
shell like a snake slipping out of its last years hide

  the peculiar eerie thing about the process was the
distinct feeling that in some dim past i had passed
through a similar process

  i thought of the professor and wondered what he
would have to say about this wonderful phenomenon
when lo there he was standing at my side per-
fectly visible and smiling at my evident astonishment
and agitation what is more he appeared very
much younger than when t had last seen him

  glancing down at my own body i found that i
also had become quite visible by some wonderful
alchemy of nature and with the ability to see my
body once more came the feeling that somehow it
was not the same body but a new body which pul-
sated with all the virility and elasticity and joy
of youth i possessed the same tireless energy and
buoyancy that i remembered having when a boy it
was marvellous unbelievable at last i seemed to
have discovered the fountain of eternal youth

  what in the world has happened now professor
winter i inquired what does it all mean

  he smiled radiantly and his eyes from which the
spectacles had disappeared were brilliant with en-
thusiasm when he answered it means dear friend
that i have attained more infinitely more than i
dreamed it means that the vibrations of our phy-
sical bodies were raised to such a degree that our
spiritual bodies have temporarily become liberated
and separated from our physical shells to all in-

tents and purposes we are now inhabitants of the
plane below the infra red

  i nodded somewhat dazed a slow dim compre-
hension was beginning to filter into my mind how-
ever there were some things that i was utterly un-
able to understand and grasp therefore i put an-
other question

  you spoke about ourselves being in our spiritual
bodies i dont seem to be able to grasp that part
of it although in a dim way i seem to grasp some-
thing of what you mean to convey what do you
mean 

  he nodded with sympathetic understanding

  i shall explain with the greatest pleasure the
higher science has discovered and absolutely proven
by means of personal demonstration and experiment
that man is a triune being that is to say man con-
sists of a soul which is his real ego or self a spiri-
tual body and a physical body

  the physical body and its sensory organism is
the souls instrument of expression and manifesta-
tion while living on the physical plane by means of
which it gathers experience and knowledge for its
development and unfoldment according to natures
lawr of evolution and progress

  after the change called death the soul and its
spiritual body which latter co-exists with the phy-
sical body during earth life withdraws from the
dead shell and takes up its life  the spiritual plane
where it leaves off on the earth plane the spiritual
world being a material world similar to the physical
but of infinitely higher vibration and refinement
there are then duties to perform work to do and
experience to gather for the soul this it does by
means of the spiritual body and its sensory organism
which is identical with but infinitely finer than the
physical sensory organism

  in other words the soul continues to carry on
its search for the truth for knowledge and wisdom
in that world as in the physical world and fron
it when its time comes it evolutes to still higher ana
finer planes of existence in still finer bodies con-
forming to and consistent with the vibrations of each
particular plane how far this process goes on no
one knows not even the wisest of the masters of wis-
dom on any of the planes know

  nor is there death it is only a change to another
body in order that the soul may continue in its
evolution it is all just a matter of different vibra-
tion for instance if it were possible to so attune
the physical sensory organs as to correspond with
the vibrations of spiritual matter then it would be
quite possible for any of us to see or otherwise sense
anything that goes on in the spiritual plane closest
to earth but this would conflict with natural laws
the laws of vibration and it is therefore impossible
no one can change or overcome the laws of nature

i gazed in wonder at the man of science and
marveled at his knowledge but i objected
have we not just found that the laws of vibration
as you call them can be changed are we not in
a spiritual world in our spiritual bodies has not
your machine accomplished the impossible 

  he shook his head and smiled quietly

  no you are mistaken since our materialization
on this plane i know that rather than having changed
the attunement of the optic and auditory organs
my apparatus has raised the vibration of the entire


amazing stories

physical body to such a degree as to enable the spiri-
tual body to pass through and out of the physical
shell

  let it be understood however that this plane
is only another physical plane of different vibration
and that we are able to realize these vibrations with
our lower spiritual senses moreover the body in
which you perceive me is not my spiritual body it
is only a vito-chemical substance which covers my
body and makes it visible and tangible on this plane
because this substance is of the same vibration which
belongs to this plane

  i shook my head its too deep for me profes-
sor even after i have experienced it and i am
willing to take your word for it

  we had become so engrossed in our conversation
that we quite forgot our environment perfect si-
lence reigned but it seemed to be a silence vibrant
with human magnetism

  we gazed about us the sub-infra people ap-
parently were able to see us also for every eye in
that vast place was fixed upon tis in seeming word-
less awe and astonishment

  presently we perceived a movement at the end of
the central aisle where the throne was located and
then we saw that the two rulers had descended from
the throne and were coming toward us

  a lane formed rapidly in the great throng of peo-
ple and along this the majestic couple advanced with
quiet dignity a few paces from us they stopped
and raised both hands with open palms toward us

  welcome strange friends

  it was as if they had spoken in our own language
so clearly did my mind receive the thought behind
their words

  following my companions example i also raised
both hands in their manner also attempting as gra-
cious a smile as our hosts gave us to our great
astonishment and embarrassment both embraced each
of us in turn and touched their lips to our fore-
heads

  we were unable to say anything

  the greetings over the exalted brother-such was
his official title we learned liter-took the profes-
sors left hand and led the way to the throne his
fellow ruler a woman of transcendant beauty and
grace took possession of my left hand in like man-
ner and we followed

  from every side the people seemed to greet us
with brotherly acclaim and smiles of welcome it
was indeed a triumphal procession i walked as
though in a dream the glorious woman at my side
emitted a perfume like attar of roses subtle and
delicate like the scent of a dewy rose at sunrise

  it was wonderful almost intoxicating and from
her hand there passed to me a current of magnetism
that was intensely delicious causing my entire entity
to vibrate with a strange power and awakening all
that was noble in my soul

  what a marvelous world i thought and how
marvelous this human perfection of the flower-be-
decked people all about me it was as if i were the
hero of some wonderful romance walking to the
altar with my beloved princess past great metallic
shining ornamental columns of immense height un-
fathomable in the all-pervading strange violet light
and presently i became conscious of music soft
sweet and entrancing like the wind sweeping gently
over the strings of ancient aeolean harps

  we were upon the platform facing the people
who were gazing up at us in expectation perfect
silence reigned even the soft music seemed to have
ceased we two earth dwellers were between the
royal pair standing at the outer edge of the throne-
altar

  with exquisite courtesy the exalted brother spoke
to us strange friends in the name of our people
we beg of you to tell us where is the land you call
home and in what manner you have appeared so
mysteriously among us

  we saw you first as indistinct luminous shapes
and then you gradually took the forms of men
tell us are you men or spirits

every eye in that immense assembly was riv-
eted on us at my earnest urging the professor
began to explain the manner of our appearance
there

  it was strange but just as we readily received
their thoughts by means of the invisible waves so
they quickly understood us apparently the high
vibration of our semi-spiritual bodies made this pos-
sible and natural words were merely a matter of
form and sound

  when professor winter had finish i the ruler
turned to us with a radiant face it must be a
wonderful world to which you belong can you re-
turn to it as easily as you left it 

  professor winter gazed at me in a distinctly dep-
recating manner and spread out his hands in an
expressive gesture of helplessness that exalted
brother is something  do not know he indicated
me with a respectful wave of his hand as he con-
tinued  when i began this experiment with my
honored friend i did not anticipate such an amazing
success i never dreamed that we would be liber-
ated from our physical bodies and consequently made
no arrangements for such a contingency the gaze
he directed toward me was expressive of deep re-
gret as he finished

  i am now extremely sorry for having placed my
friend in such a predicament

  with a smile that must have expressed my deep
content i waved his regret aside dont worry
about me old chap i am perfectly satisfied never
in my life have i imagined such wonderful sur-
roundings and such a delightful situation i have
no family ties and like yourself will not be missed
in that dreary old world of ours

  the man of science appeared greatly relieved
the ruler smiled approvingly i eloli wish to
commend both of you for your courage hi like
circumstances there are few who would show the

same degree of courage and- here he turned

to his companion -i am certain that my dear sister
ealara will concur with me

  the beautiful angelic woman at my side smiled
sweetly and nodded the light from her radiant
blue eyes caused my pulses to beat with a rapidity
i had never experienced before in all my life my
whole body tingled and glowed with exaltation

  both the professor and i bowed in recognition- of
the generous praise

  the next minute our hosts conducted us down
from the throne and again we passed along the great
center aisle through the human lane of beautiful
scented people until we came to an immense semi-
circular portal resembling the great outer doors of
below the infra red



some of the cathedrals i had seen in europe a
moment later we passed out into a garden of en-
chantment

  at last i had a very definite conception of what
the fabled garden of the olympians must have been
and there above us was our old friend the sun
apparently the same yet shining with less glare and
emitting only moderate heat

  great shady trees were all about us some re-
sembled palms with immense leaves about twenty
feet long and the width of a man some were like
the banyan trees of india with many trunks grace-
ful as the exquisite columns of the alhambra of
spain creating avenues under their great leafy
domes of emerald where promenading was de-
lightful

  there were also other trees and shrubs too nu-
merous to mention and the flowers some of
these were the same fragrant white blossoms with
which the people were decorated and which our
guides wore others resembled immense orchids
vari-colored and exhaling a perfume like heliotrope

  hundreds of varieties abounded everywhere set
off exquisitely against the blue-green grassy moss
which covered the ground like a deep soft carpet
over which we passed without a sound

   i noticed no flies or other insects but at intervals
like the flashings of exquisite gems brilliantly
plumed birds passed over the flowers and through
the foliage overhead

  i turned to view the place whence we had emerged
and an exclamation of amazement escaped me which
startled my three companions i looked at professor
winter and pointed his gaze followed the direction
of my hand and he also uttered a cry of amazement

  the great auditorium was located on an immense
cliff of a white marble-like stone which by some
wonderful incredible feat of sculpture had been
formed into a gigantic bust of a beautiful woman
perfect in every detail it was stupendous and we
two earth dwellers could only stand there and stare
lost in admiration of the titanic work of art

  a duet of musical soft laughter aroused us from
our contemplation eloli and ealara were gazing at
us smilingly the soft harmonious voice of the
latter caressed my ears

  you are gazing upon the likeness of sainana
first woman ruler of alania our country dear
friends

  professor winter expressed himself in an en-
thusiastic manner and praised the colossal yet ex-
quisite work of art while i concurred most heartily

  there is nothing to compare with it in our
world he emphasized

  t nodded the sphinx of egypt compares with
it as the moon to the sun both in size and in beauty
the great pyramid of gizeh could be placed within
the superb head and leave enough room for an
army

  the two rulers were greatly pleased with our ex-
pressions of appreciation eloli explained

  thus do we honor our best beloved ancestors
by using their likenesses for our most sacred abode
our home since many generations this has been
the custom of our people

we passed on and presently came to a sort
of circular pavilion built of a marble-like
semi-transparent stone and covered by a great hemi-

spherical dome of emerald-hued transparent sub-
stance

  the great dome rested upon an exquisitely sculp-
tured entablature supported by a great number of
slender graceful columns in the center under the
emerald joof a marvelously executed group of two
nude maidens formed from an alabaster-like sub-
stance caught our eyes the moment we entered the
cool interior

  the two figures stood back to back and their
sweetly smiling faces were raised upward to where
upon their elevated hands they supported a great
bowl of tulip formation from which a great foun-
tain of water shot upward fully forty or fifty feet
curving outward and downward in an immensely
enlarged form of the bowl and falling in a refresh-
ing aromatic shower into the wide crystal basin be-
neath

  winding our way through the myriad ferns in
beautiful stone containers we soon found ourselves
on the edge of the great crystal basin courteously
our hosts bade us to be seated upon the circular
bench which surrounded it and which permitted
one to refresh his feet in the cool water beneath
quickly the professor and i removed our shoes and
emulated the example of eloli and ealara his sister

  eloli emitted a peculiar high tone and imme-
diately two beautiful maids appeared one of them
bore a crystal tray with a basket woven from a
gold-like metallic wire from which several different
kinds of aromatic beautifully colored strange fruits
peeped forth temptingly

  the other held a tray of golden metal upon the
artistically engraved surface of which stood four
vessels shaped like large eggs standing on their ends
with the large portion cut off and the lower part sup-
ported in tripods of metal like transparent gold

  with her own hands ealara took one of the ves-
sels from the tray and presented it to me while her
brother offered the other to the scientist hesitantly
i received the delicate container from my beautiful
hostess and placed my lips to the edge of the fra-
gile transparent vessel that seemed to be made of
the finest white porcelain imaginable carefully i
tasted of the cool slightly effervescing liquid and
found it marvelously palatable and refreshing a
wave of new strength seemed to course through my
body from it and involuntarily i smacked my lips
as i finished the last few drops

  in courteous terms i expressed my appreciation
and was just about to ask how the beverage was
made when suddenly we heard distant cries as of
fear and a commotion outside in the garden

   eloli and his sister rose quickly and gazed in alarm
toward the entrance a moment later a young alan-
ian rushed in sank to one knee and bowed with
his left hand placed over the heart and the right flat
against the forehead

  exalted brother the pluonians are coming
he reported and there was suppressed excitement in
his voice

  the pluonians i felt some calamity at hand
and the suddenly stern face of eloli confirmed it
so even this paradise was not without its snakes
i gazed at ealara she was calm and her eyes were
fixed upon her brothers face with quiet confidence

  the latter made a sign for the messenger to rise

  bid alam to come immediately he commanded

  the man made an obeisance and sped away


amazing stories

  who are these pluonians exalted brother
professor winter inquired

  eloli folded his great arms across his wide chest
and his face was very grave as he explained

  the pluonians are a terrible enemy a lower race
than ours who hate us because of our progress and
our harmony among ourselves occasionally they
enter into ruthless warfare against us often they
come in the night and carry off our women and
children come every minute counts now

  we passed out of the pavilion and just outside
of the entrance were met by a powerfully-built mar-
tial-looking alanian this was alam chief of the
alanian army he bowed deeply to the two rulers
i await your orders he said simply

  eloli spoke rapidly are the warriors ready
alam inclined his head they are now forming
for the defense

  and the women and children

  they are being rushed to the top chamber

  eloli nodded it is well i shall lead in battle
myself he stated sternly

  then turning to ealara he placed both hands on
her shoulders and his eyes radiated a world of tender
brotherly love as he spoke gently sister beloved
do you go and comfort the women and children and
pray to the great ruler of the universe for strength
in our bodies and power to overcome the evil will
of the enemy

  they embraced tenderly and kissed each other
upon the cheeks after taking leave of myself and
the professor she walked rapidly away with such
grace and lightness that she seemed to float

  after having received several rapid orders alam
hurried away also eloli turned to us and there
was genuine sadness and regret in his eyes

friends i am very sad that this trouble had to oc-
cur to mar the pleasure of your visit among us
let us hope and pray that ours will be the victory
both the professor and i fervently seconded his
wish

  come he said i shall lead you where you will
be safe and whence you can witness that which shall
take place

  he led us swiftly back to the great human edifice
past the wide portal from the outer gate in the
high garden wall a steady stream of women and
children flowed - toward the palace to disappear
through the wide portal into the interior

  they were coming from the city outside of the
palace walls which we had not yet seen some of
the women were calm some excited and some evi-
dently frightened but most of the children ap-
peared to enjoy the prospect of war and excitement

  as we learned later there was a great inner stone
staircase which led to the top of the immense stone
figure into the head of it just at the level of the
gigantic eyes was a vast observation chamber and
it was into this that the women and children entered
for safetys sake the bottom of the stone stairway
was in times of danger closed by means of a huge
block of stone and could be opened only from within
so that the inmates were safe as long as their water
and food lasted the eyes of the head served as
windows these immense apertures by the way

were the only window openings in the entire colossai
edifice

a short distance from the main entrance eloli
stopped we were facing a smooth wall he
touched a certain spot and to our great surprise a
large block of stone swung outward as if on hinges
disclosing a narrow stairway beyond embracing
each of us in turn the ruler pointed to the stairway

  this stair leads to the chamber of loalio man
of wisdom he will explain to you many things
go in peace

  we entered and immediately the stone door swung
back into place we began to mount the stairs the
illumination here was the same peculiar soft violet
light that we had first observed in the great audi-
torium of the palace

  search as we would we could not discover the
source of it

  it must be some sort of radio-activity that gen-
erates it my companion observed

  i nodded quite possible besides do you no-
tice the peculiar invigorating quality it possesses

  he said that he had observed the same thing

  here the stairs made a sudden turn and a mo-
ment later we found ourselves upon a narrow stone
balcony formed by an ornament around the neck
of the gigantic head just under the chin

  immediately we became absorbed in contemplation
of the strange panorama spread out below us

  far below the stream of humanity was still pour-
ing into the palace grounds the women and children
passing on and the men forming into battle forma-
tion at each side of the main avenue we observed
many touching scenes of leave-taking

  and then on either side of us we saw the city

  never could i have imagined anything so fan-
tastic 

  picture to yourself if you can a great multitude
of the most exquisite gardens and in the center of
each the marvelously sculptured bust of a beautiful
woman or a handsome man and at intervals two of
them together

  a movement in the palace gardens below attracted
our attention with difficulty i removed my gaze
from the wonderful now deserted city

  the army of the alanians were marching out
of the great outer gate to meet the enemy quickly
marching ten abreast they moved out over the im-
mense moss-covered plain fronting the palace far
away on the other side of the plain was dense forest
and from this forest while we watched appeared
a dense dark mass which we soon learned were the
pluonians

  my gaze turned again to the thousands of stal-
wart alanian warriors and presently the conviction
struck me that there was something strange about
them for a few minutes i puzzled about the mat-
ter then suddenly i had the answer

  i turned to my companion professor winter 
do you not notice something strange about those
soldiers who go out to meet the enemy

  the keen eyes of the scientist concentrated upon
the alanians and he emitted an exclamation of sur-
prise by jupiter you are right barton-there
is not a single weapon on any of them

  i nodded exactly that is what struck me as
being so odd so unusual to our terrestrial minds
what under the sun do they fight with 

  you shall see in good time friends a deep
vibrant vaice uttered the words immediately behind
us
below the infra red



  we turned quickly in surprise and beheld re-
garding us with a benevolent smile a venerable old
man who had stepped from a chamber the narrow
door of which we had not before noticed

  it was loalio man of wisdom his long wavy
hair white as freshly fallen snow hung down over
his back he was dressed in a long white robe
that came to his bare ankles his face which in
common with all other alanians was hairless bore
such a sublime expression of benevolence and sanc-
tity that i experienced the involuntary desire to
kneel down before him and ask for a blessing his
deep blue-gray eyes and wide high brow indicated
the student and thinker and gave one the impression
of infinite wisdom his mouth was firm but kindly
and one looked in vain for any weakness in his face

  his feet and head were bare and across his chest
suspended by a golden chain he wore the same glit-
tering ornament in the shape of two outspread wings
that distinguished the two rulers of alania

  he extended a hand to each of us in hearty wel-
come and i felt a strong flow of force from his
hand into my body

  the welcome over he continued his explanations

  you will find that there are more powerful forces
in the universe than the weapons of war on your
plane which i see depicted in your mind and which
bruise and tear the body

  with a wave of his hand he again turned our at-
tention to the field of the coming battle

  although the distance to the ground where the two
opposing armies were approaching each other was
about five miles the atmosphere was so marvelously
crystal-clear that distance seemed annihilated and
we could see almost every detail with perfect dis-
tinction

   but loalio with exquisite courtesy handed to each
of us what appeared to be a mirror with a thick
back the instrument was constructed from a light
silvery material and the lens was of perfect quality
tie waved his hand toward the battlefield observe
well he suggested

  following his directions the professor and i held
it the instrument between us and the vista before
us i heard the amazed exclamation of my com-
panion and no wonder with a clearness that
surpassed that of any optical instrument i had ever
seen on our plane the lens recorded the far scene
as if we were within a few feet of it

nphe alanians and the pluonians no greater

   contrast could be imagined while the alanians
were white-skinned fair-haired and blue- or gray-
or gray-blue-eyed the pluonians were dark-skinned
some almost black black-haired and their eyes of
the color of jet

  while the alanians were beautifully proportioned
as to body and handsome as to features the enemy
were of heavy unwieldy build unduly long arms
and their bestial faces were covered with short
bristly black hair

  their long arms crouching walk and hairy over-
muscled bodies and faces resembled the larger sim-
ians of our own world

  both races however wore only loincloths and
neither had any weapon

  a veritable battle of angels and devils

  the enemy had formed into a great semi-circle
with the ends directed against the alanians the

latter on the other hand advanced in the form of
a capital v the apex of which pointed at the cen-
ter of the enemy semi-circle

  the man of science and i watched in fascinated
suspense and expectation their manner of battle

  gradually the pluonians drew closer the mirrors
in our hands revealed their ferocious visages dis-
tinctly while their wild chant in all its bestial hoarse-
ness and savagery was carried to our ears by the
light wind ever faster their gait became as they
advanced until at last they broke into a trot

  we could now observe that at the center of their
formation their ranks were tripled thinning down
gradually toward the horns of the semi-circle

  our friends the alanians had stopped and were
grimly awaiting the attackers with apparent placid-
ity leaning slightly forward with all the muscles
of their splendid bodies tense

  i thrilled at their heroic composure and a glance
at my companion showed that he was no less im-
pressed

  the chanting of the pluonians had ceased they
were coming on at top speed the impact of the
two armies was terrible a dull roaring crunching
noise that sent the shivers up and down my back
but the apex of the alanian v had penetrated the
black semicircle

  and then followed the most fantastic battle-if
such it could be called-that it is possible to imagine

  almost perfect silence reigned there was no
wrestling beating or slugging that is what made
it so indescribably unreal to our terrestrial minds

  this is what occurred

  a black warrior would spring like a tiger upon a
white warrior or a white upon a black they would
grapple and then seemingly become motionless in
each others fierce embrace only the quivering
muscles on the great bodies indicated the terrific
strain of the combatants

  they stood there motionless like some sculptured
work of art apparently doing nothing more than
gazing intently into each others eyes until at last
either one or the other would release his hold and slip
lifeless to the ground

  it was uncanny   could not understand it and
yet i knew there was some terrific force in action
there on the battlefield what was it

  then suddenly i remembered the words of loalio
the wise the same thought must have struck pro-
fessor winter also for almost simultaneously we
turned to the old man for an explanation

  the man of wisdom watched the strange conflict
with stern eyes seeming to read our thoughts
and without removing his gaze from the field of bat-
tle he explained

  you see there the mighty powers of one mind
pitted against the powers of another it is the force
of the concentrated intelligently directed will that
decides the issue

  will power directed in a certain way becomes
more deadly than the knife or other weapon of your
world many generations ago as the ancient rec-
ords show a man  our plane also used the gen-
erally accepted weapons to carry on war but long
ago the race on this plane have relinquished the use
of them

  the warrior possessed of the stronger will-power

is able to overcome an opponent just as the physi-
cally stronger man overcomes the weaker

  first the functions of the intellectual or great
brain are stopped and thus the channels of com-
munication between the outer world and the soul
by means of its live physical senses are closed
next the barriers of the middle brain are broken
down and thus the muscular action of the body is
paralyzed

  finally the lower brain is overcome by the down-
ward sweep of the force which radiates from the
mental battery of the opponent and thus the nerve
system is under his control the heart action is ar-
rested at the will of the conqueror and immediate
death is the result

  he stopped and regarded us seriously to see if
we had understood

  professor winter whose eyes were aflame with
scientific interest nodded understanding but i
shook my head in helpless confusion whereupon
he explained

   as far as i can gather the process of thisstrange
unheard-of warfare is a sort of super-hypnotism
no doubt you have read about the mesmeric and
the hypnotic processes

  i nodded affirmatively

  very well there seems to be this difference
the mesmerist or the hypnotist on your plane finds
it impossible to influence his subjects without their
cooperation willingly given or by rendering them
passive by a soporific a person in the full and
conscious possession of an active will cannot be
hypnotized nor mesmerized

  here however we have a very active especially
trained will confronting the would-be dominator
here is no passive state or cooperation of any sort
on the contrary here is a very intensively active
will itself intent upon conquest

  all the tremendous powers of each mind are si-
multaneously concentrated in the effort of overcom-
ing the resistance of the other and we see strong
powerful men succumb to the superior powers of
their opponents

  therefore we have here an entirely different
and infinitely more powerful form of mental con-
centration and dominion than known on our own
plane no doubt subject to different laws of nature
entirely

  the explanation given by the man of science cor-
roborated by loalio who had listened attentively was
enlightening  marveled at the tremendous possi-
bilities of the thing a person killed merely by the
concentrated merciless will power of another it
was terrible

  we turned our attention again to the scene of
conflict and noted to our joy that the whites were
unmistakably gaining a great many more black
warriors than white were lying on the ground

  slowly but surely the alanian apex pushed far-
ther through the center of the enemy the great
v stretched itself out and its wings gradually
curled about the ends of the pluonian semi-circle

suddenly loalio grasped my arm and pointed
his eyes were shining with interest and an-
ticipatory triumph

  at the very center of the two opposed forces two
gigantic figures were swaying in the terrible em-
brace of death one white and one black quickly

the professor and i focussed our mirrors upon the
pair one of them was eloli ruler of the alanians
the other uruom king of the pluonians

   chest to chest they stood the brilliantly blue orbs
of eloli burning into the black redly flaming eyes
of the hideous bestial-faced black ruler their ter-
rible wills in inconceivably intense action

  it seemed like a decisive conflict between the
forces of light and darkness good and evil angel
and demon

  which of the two would win that battle of terrible
psychic forces

  a slight scarcely detectable swaying of the two
great bodies was the only motion the only visible
sign of their mutual efforts physically and psy-
chically

  watching them my muscles involuntarily became
tense and my breath came in gasps out of sheer
sympathy with the great white ruler

  owing to the lack of motion the battle was more
exciting than a wrestling match or a fistic contest
could have been because of the great tension which
one instinctively knew existed between the two foes
such a state of things could not possibly last long

  and indeed it did not

  slowly very slowly the pure dominating power
of the white king fighting for justice and right
prevailed over the power of evil in the black king

  realizing his waning power uruom made a des-
perate effort to withdraw his gaze from the blazing
relentless sapphire eyes of eloli leaning his head far
far backwards but fight as he would with all the
mental power at his command he could not check
the gradual domination of his cranial functions
the mental power of eloli seemed like a keen sword
which cut off his sensory channels one by one from
the outer world

  presently his muscles became inactive and finally
the dread power swept downward into his primary
brain dominating the nerve system then the end
came soon

  suddenly his head dropped to one side showing
the glazed sightless eyes the great dark body
shuddered convulsively and slipped out of the arms
of eloli to the ground uruom was dead

  a great cry of rage and fear went up from the
black warriors as they realized that with the death
of their king the battle was lost for them

  a greater shout of triumph sounded from the lips
of the white warriors

  from the dark forest beyond a great blare as
from an immense horn sounded immediately each
pluonian who was able to do so tore himself from
the embrace of his white adversary and fled toward
the forest but many were taken as prisoners

  the battle was over behind us loalio raised
both hands to heaven and gave silent thanks to the
great ruler of the universe reverently with bowed
heads the professor and i waited until he had fin-
ished presently he led us down the stair and into
the palace garden again and we walked toward the
great portal of the auditorium

  standing in regal grandeur on the throne plat-
form just at the edge of the top step loalio man
of wisdom awaited the triumphal procession that
approached the throne the noble lines of his face
expressed sublime happiness and benevolence

  the procession approached along the wide center
aisle singing a grand paean of joy first came
below the infra red



eloli whose left arm encircled the waist of ealara
his sister next followed alam the chief of the
army then a group of his officers and behind them
came the warriors accompanied by their wives
sweethearts and other relatives

  the whole thing viewed by the professor and me
at either side and a little distance behind loalio
was indescribably thrilling

  at the foot of the throne the two rulers stopped
and the song ceased loalio raised his arms and
held out his hands over them in blessing with
inclined heads and in the vast silence they listened
as in deep melodious tones the voice of the wise
man rolled out in thanksgiving

  the ceremony over the happy people filed out of
the great auditorium while i and professor winter
hastened to express our felicitations to eloli with
loalio leading we passed from the throne room
into a magnificent banquet hall behind us alam
chief of the army and four of his officers followed
at a respectful distance

  the vast apartment was at least one hundred feet
long about half as wide and as nearly as i could
judge thirty feet high

  there was little furniture but the decorations on
the walls and ceiling gave eloquent proof of the high
artistic ability of the alanians on the ceiling
gamboling children exquisitely carvcd and painted
in lifelike colors were chasing birds of brilliant
plumage

we passed on to the very center of the room
where a massive oval table covered with a
pure white damask-like cloth was laid for ten per-
sons and beautifully adorned with flowers in origi-
nal artistic designs before each place was a large
golden plate and one of the exquisite delicate gob-
lets we had already seen in the garden no knives
forks or other tableware were visible

  behind each one of the ivory-like finely carved
chairs was stationed a beautiful servant girl who
at our approach pulled back the chairs for us

  loalio had passed to the head of the table while
we stood there at our appointed places he first raised
his hands heavenward in a gesture of supplication
and then he spread them over the table in blessing

  the simple ceremony over we seated ourselves

  immediately from a curtained alcove there
sounded delightful soft music evidently from string
instruments and at almost the same time the beau-
tiful servants began to bring us fruits and a sort
of delicious wafer that literally melted on the tongue
with the same sort of invigorating drink that had
been served to us earlier in the garden

  the fruits some of which resembled our kinds on
the earth-plane were delicious there were no hot
foods nor meats of any kind evidently the alan-
ians were thorough vegetarians

  and in one other respect the meal was quite dif-
ferent from any similar function in our own world
there was no conversation during the meal the
badinage repartee and social chit-chat that we
know would have been decidedly out of place among
such ideal surroundings

  however there was not the slightest indication of
stiffness of any sort instead it was with a very
decided feeling of comfort and well-being that the
meal progressed

  at the professors side eloli the ruler ate his
fruit with quiet serenity while at my left ealara de-
lighted me with her nearness evidently professor
winter and i had been given the places of honor

  at a sign from loalio the music ceased he
turned to us with a smile and said friends i am
ready now to answer the questions which  see in
your minds

  the scientists face became eager at once he
waved his hand about the vast apartment i greatly
desire to know by what method and process it was
possible to carve such a wonderful dwelling out of
the living rock do you also use explosives as we
the earth dwellers do

  the wise man did not understand the professors
term explosives whereupon the latter proceeded
to explain as best he could

  when my companion adventurer had finished the
former sat silent a few moments in thought then
he gave a quiet command to one of the maidens who
departed quickly and a few minutes later ushered
in four strong men who between them in a sort of
sling carried a great block of stone which they
placed upon a small round but strong table that one
of the servants had pushed between the professor
and the wise man

  when the carriers had departed loalio reached
forth his right hand and touched his index finger
to the stone block his face was quite calm but
from his eyes seemed to radiate terrific power and
even as i watched in amazement the stone changed
its form

  it seemed to grow larger and a mistiness seemed
to surround it then when the mistiness had dis-
appeared i gazed in utter stupefaction upon the per-
fect sculptured likeness of my friend professor
winter the whole process had not taken more
than two or three minutes it was unbelievable and
i rose and touched the stone bust to make certain
that it was not an optical illusion

  the others had watched me in amusement as for
my companion he was the intensely interested sci-
entist immediately he turned to loalio for an ex-
planation of the phenomena

  with a grave smile the wise man complied

  as you probably know there exist four life ele-
ments in nature the electro-magnetic the vito-chem-
ical the spiritual and the soul element

  professor winter nodded and his eyes gleamed
with interest

  loalio continued the first of these elements
controls the mineral world  the first and second com-
bined the plant world the first second and the
spiritual element combine in the animal and all four
of the elements compose the human entity

  what i have done with this stone is simply due
to my control of the electro-magnetic element it is
just as easy to disintegrate the rock in the same
manner watch

  again he stretched out his hand toward the stone
quickly a cloud of mist formed about it becoming
thicker and thicker until it formed a sort of cloud
about ten times the original size of the stone slowly
it lifted from the table and gently floated to the floor
quickly the cloud phenomenon sank down thinned
and disappeared leaving on the floor an area of about
one square yard covered with thick white dust-the
composing particles of what had been a huge stone-
-

amazing stories

while i stared at loalio in awe the professor

rose quickly walked over to the disintegrated
stone dust and rubbed some of it through his fingers
he nodded satisfied and explained to me this
powder is finer than the best mill could possibly
grind it the reason is that the stone has been dis-
integrated and separated into individual molecules

  but how i was utterly bewildered

  regretfully he shook his head that i do not
know but- here he bowed respectfully to the wise
man -some day i hope to learn the method

  loalio nodded gravely it is possible my friend
but the attainment of control over natures forces re-
quires many years of intense study perseverance and
practice very few attain this power for to most
people it is too difficult a problem to solve requiring
as it does perfect self-control and the living of a life
in strict accordance with natures constructive
i rinciple

  he rose from the table and all of us followed his
example while the officers bowed deeply and left
the banquet hall to go back to their duties loalio led
the way into an adjoining chamber which proved to
be the music room

  there were several string instruments somewhat
resembling the ancient lyres of the greeks and some
were similar to the large harps on our plane with
the exception that the strings ran horizontally instead
of vertically in the center of the great room stood
an instrument which resembled nothing which i had
ever seen in our own world

  it was a great tripod fully seven feet high the
legs very heavy at the bottom and tapering at the
top were composed of a semi-transparent substance
like topaz at the top the legs were fastened to a
triangular plate of a white metal and at the bottom
to a similar but far larger plate through the cen-
ters of these two plates and rigidly attached to them
passed a metallic rod  thick at the bottom and gradu-
ally tapering to the size of a mans small finger
ranged on this rod according to size one above an-
other were a great number of triangular metallic
plates beginning large and thick at the bottom of the
instrument and ending in small ones of wafer-like
thinness at the top

  ealara who had led me by the hand invited me
with sweet courtesy to be seated upon one of the
comfortable divan-like chairs and walked to the
tripod with two slender wooden rods she began to
play it

  instantly the chamber was filled with exquisite
tones of perfect harmony a strange melody arousing
all that was good and poetic in my soul ealara
played with delicate touch and deep feeling giving
forth waves of wonderful symphony which raised
my soul to a condition of veritable bliss

  even professor winter scientist that he was
seemed spellbound by the music and loalio and
eloli sat there in visible deep contented revery as the
waves of harmony caressed their ears

  when the beautiful player had finished both the
professor and i hastened to express our enthusiastic
appreciation

  soon the conversation devolved chiefly upon pro-
fessor winter and loalio from what the wise man
said it appeared that

  there were many nations on the sub-infra plane
most of them white and advanced peoples the rest
to which the pluonians belonged were primitive and
dark-skinned

  at the head of each white nation were two chosen
rulers a man and a woman who ruled jointly the
male ruler was chosen by the men of the nation the
woman by the female citizens

  they were selected because of their superior wis-
dom purity of character and their true sense of
equity justice and right sometimes as in the case
of eloli and ealara it happened that the two rulers
were chosen from the same family

  every three years a great competition was held
at the capital of each nation at which all the most
advanced citizens of both sexes participated they
who excelled in all the intellectual and moral tests
were chosen as the next rulers often the present
rulers were chosen for a second term

  at each period of nine years the supreme intel-
lectuals from all the white nations rulers and others
assembled in the central capital of orth there the
supreme test was held whoever passed it were
chosen as the central rulers for a period of nine
years to them all the other white nations looked for
guidance and counsel the central rulers were also
one man and one woman with exactly equal powers
in their individual spheres of activity

  in case that one of the rulers should die before
the expiration of his term the next highest intel-
lectual was chosen until the next election

  the paramount duty of the rulers was the intel-
lectual spiritual moral and psychic evolution and
progress of their peoples there was no industry
and commerce as we on our plane understand them
the needs of the people were few

  their climatic conditions too differed from ours
it was always mild summer weather this necessi-
tated few clothes which very likely partially ac-
counted for the complete absence of any sickness
they were all strict vegetarians and each family
grew sufficient fruits and vegetables for its own
needs	

  only when something needed to be done for the
common good or for the rulers did the whole nation
join forces an inherent sense of duty and love
made them see to the needs of each other

  the servant problem was met in the same way
all the servants in the palaces of the rulers were
there voluntarily for a period of one year unless
they desired to stay longer the only medium of ex-
change was personal service

these people produced many fine artists and
craftsmen there were no churches this was
a country of monotheists who believed in an invisible
omnipotent and loving ruler of the universe whom
they worshipped at intervals in the palaces of their
rulers as we had seen

  birth was the same as on our plane

  at last death was mentioned and right here we
heard something very strange it answered the un-
spoken questions in my mind about the dead left on
thebattle field i had not seen any of them brought
in and had seen no preparations for their burial so
i had wondered

  the strange fact that loalio mentioned in this
connection was that the body of a person after death
did not decay-it literally evaporated as soon as
the life-element was withdrawn from the body at the
time of death the strange chemical process of nature
began until at the end of about one of our hours the
body had completely disappeared
below the infra red

  they believed that after physical death the soul
clothed in a finer body passed into a finer higher
world

  it is a material world like this explained loalio
but of finer matter and infinitely higher vibration
the advanced wise men like loalio who was an
ex-central ruler were of such high spiritual devel-
opment that they could communicate with the next
world with full consciousness while still in the phy-
sical body and in full possession of their will and
voluntary powers

  they believed that the evolution of man is prac-
tically an eternal process that the soul in ever refined
bodies ascends from plane to plane until it reaches an
ultimate condition of perfection

  one point loalio made very clear that it is im-
possible for the individual soul to find self-com-
pletion or perfection alone in order to reach that
high state of being the perfect vibratory union of a
masculine and a feminine soul is absolutely necessary

  as loalio said that is the reason why we devote
all of our best energies to the development of the
true love nature we bring up our children by im-
planting the germ of love deeply into their minds
not only individual love but altruism as well

  we teach them from the very beginning how to
control the destructive passions and impulses of
their physical natures and how to re-direct these
impulses into constructive channels it is this which
has made possible the abolition of war among the
white peoples on our plane

  what a wonderful world we would have if we
could reach such a point no more wars no more
suppression of the peoples by the powerful no
more hatred between classes for there would be no
classes no more grafting stealing murder or other
transgressions no more high taxes to pay for war
debts and for armament in preparation of new wars
it would be glorious to see the end of crime court-
houses and jails

  here ealara read my thoughts and asked

  is it then such a terrible world from which you
come surely not all the people there are bad i
am sure that both of you are good men arc there
not many such  are not your women good 

  we assured her that there were more good than
bad people in our world and that our women formed
the main moral foundation

  and then to my own great astonishment professor
winter told them that he had heard of wise men on
our plane who lived holy lives and could control the
forces of nature how through their control of na-
tures forces they could create things make flowers
grow from seeds in a few minutes and so many
more strange things these wise men were in every
country living secluded lives and pursuing their
studies in secret making every effort for the good
of humanity

  then to my intense embarrassment eloli turned
to me with a smile tt seems my friend that you
doubt the existence of these holy men and their pow-
ers on your own plane

  and now gazing from one to the other of the
three exalted alanians i knew that they had easily
read my skeptic attitude of mind of which i had
been but semi-conscious

  i made an apologetic gesture i am sorry but
my mind seems to be of a quality which cannot accept
as a fact anything that i have not personally experi-
enced or demonstrated

  eloli asked one of the maids present to place upon
the floor before us a golden earth-filled pot and a
seed from one of the flowers in pots which with
their wonderful coloring and perfume served to
adorn the fine apartment

he turned to me not to entertain but to in-
struct you shall i demonstrate to you that
these things are possible he bowed with deep re-
spect in the direction of loalio our supreme
exalted brother has demonstrated to you his control
over the electro-magnetic forces of nature i his
deeply grateful pupil shall demonstrate to you that
control over the next higher the vito-chemical ele-
ment in combination with the lower is possible

  his right hand with the index and second fingers
extended pointed to the seed in the golden plate
while he concentrated upon it with fixed intensity

  and even as we watched intently a little cloud
of luminous mist seemed to surround it becoming
rapidly larger as it rose into a column several feet
in height gradually within the mist phenomenon
the faint tracery of a flower plant appeared

  at first it was very faint but it rapidly became
more and more distinct until no more than two min-
utes later the misty light phenomenon cleared away
and there before us in all its beauty covered with a
multitude of fresh aromatic blossoms stood a mag-
nificent flower bush

  i rubbed my eyes and pinched my leg to make sure
that it was not an illusion then while our hosts
watched me with smiling sympathy i emulated the
example of my fellow-adventurer who had broken
off one of the flowers and was examining it with
intense interest there was no doubt about its
genuineness but i was not entirely satisfied so i
touched the flower bush with my fingers and fol-
lowed it all the way down to where it disappeared
into the soil so hard is it to overcome prejudice
and bias but i was convinced at last

  marvellous i could not find adequate terms to
express myself t gazed at ealara and then i stared
incredulously for sweetly smiling at me she was fast
becoming invisible a mere transparent wraith until
quicker than it takes to tell she had completely dis-
appeared

  i turned to my other three companions in bewil-
derment the professor was staring with scientific
analytic interest at the chair which the queen had
but recently occupied i was about to formulate a
question when following the smiling gaze of the
two exalted alanians i perceived ealara seated in
her place just as visible as she had been before the
experiment and smiling at me with a warmth that
went straight to my heart

  you seem very much surprised dear friend

  i was for never had i imagined the possibility of
such miracles

  and yet- she said earnestly-these are noth-
ing but visible demonstrations showing that the laws
of nature can le used and exercised by those who
have developed and unfolded the faculties capacities
and powers of the soul you and your friends-
her graceful gesture indicated the professor -can
do these things that we have done if you will but
comply with and live according the constructive laws
of nature

  but it was not the end of wonders yet ealara


amazing stories

waved her hand respectfully in the direction of
loalio watch

  the venerable master rose and with both hands
traced an outline in the atmosphere beginning at the
height of his eyes and tracing downward with a
stroking motion a number of times

  gradually a large oval form appeared in the air
before him luminous and tinted with all the colors
of the rainbow rapidly the oval form became more
dense apparently drawing together and concentrat-
ing until the outlines of a human form became
visible

  again i noted the light of intense mental and
spiritual power radiating from the eyes of the man
of wisdom

  and then even while we two earth dwellers
watched in utter fascination there suddenly stood
before us smiling at us sweetly the form of a maiden
of eighteen summers

  to the rhythm of inaudible music she began to
dance in the most graceful manner imaginable
faster and faster she danced until soon she spun
dizzily on one slender toe

  and then even as she had appeared she resolved
back into the mysterious nothingness from whence
the master had called her

it was a beautiful rest room to which we had been
personally conducted by eloli and ealara the
atmosphere within reminded one of the refreshing
scent of a pine forest

  in common with all other apartments in the im-
mense edifice the chamber was very spacious and
almost devoid of furniture other than two very com-
fortable couches and a table exquisitely carved from
some rare wood the walls of the room were painted
with wondrously artistic realistic designs of trees
flowers and birds that seemed to live

  the peculiar feature in all these chambers of the
palace was the lack of windows or any other exterior
openings yet the light and ventilation were perfect

  when the two rulers had embraced us in true
brotherly fashion and bidden us to rest well the
professor and i sat down on our couches and dis-
cussed the many strange happenings of the day and
long after i heard his first breath of deep sleep i
was still awake the day had been too crammed
with unbelievable adventures to allow of sleep

 i began to think about the pluonian prisoners i
had not seen any of them but alam the chief of the
alanian army had casually mentioned that they were
confined somewhere in a subterranean chamber of the
palace

  presently the overwhelming desire to inspect the
prisoners took possession of me very quietly so as
not to awaken my companion  rose and left the
room

  the passage in which i found myself led to a
wide descending stairway on past the corridor be-
low in which the banquet hall and music room were
located  went just below this corridor the stair-
way developed into a spiral

   it was strangely still in the palace not the slight-
est sound could be heard and my footsteps however
lightly t trod seemed unnaturally loud no doubt
everyone was asleep

  at last i came to another passage more like a tun-
nel far underground and as i entered it i experi-
enced a sudden dread but with angry pride i sup-

pressed the emotion as childish boldly i entered
the long passage

  carved out of the solid granite no doubt with the
wonderful magic of loalio and other wise men this
passage seemed to lead into interminable dim dis-
tances illuminated by the ubiquitous violet radiance
at regular intervals doors on both sides led to un-
known regions

  i passed on and suddenly was sensible of the pres-
ence of living beings somewhere close by i was
opposite a heavy door of metal from beyond it
harsh animal-like sounds guttural and menacing
came to my ears

  i should have turned back then but the devil of
curiosity within me persisted cautiously i placed
my hand upon the massive latch and pressed down
with a slight grating sound the heavy metallic door
swung open the next moment i staggered back-
ward with sudden fear

  for there from behind the grating of thick metal-
lic bars the face of a green-eyed devil stared out at
me terrible repulsive a pluonian prisoner

  ashamed of my temporary fear i summoned all
the courage at my command and faced the ape-like
hairy savage beyond whose body i could see the
forms of others of his kind-grinning ferocious
animal-men

  a voice of warning within my consciousness bade
me slam the outer door and go back to my couch
above but  would not listen

  the flaming green eyes of the pluonian at the
grating attracted my gaze with the force of a magnet
attracting iron particles i felt a rapidly increasing
numbness in my brain my senses began to reel in
a flash it came over me that the savage was exerting
his terrible volitionary force to overcome me with
all my remaining will-power i struggled desperately
to resist the dread influence sweeping over me

  but it was of no avail i felt myself slipping rap-
idly and then like a white-hot bullet into my brain
came the mental command of the pluonian open
the grating

  dimly i realized that i must not yield must not
carrv out that command but seemingly without my
volition my body responded like an automaton i
raised the heavy bar of metal that closed the grating
from the outside

  suddenly t felt myself flung aside with resistless
force as evil-smelling bodies rushed past me hairy
horrible i had the sensation of being picked up-
then blackness descended upon my mind

with the sensation of regular rhythmic motion
consciousness came back to me i was lying
across the shoulders of a huge pluonian bound hand
and foot who carried me without apparent effort
all about me was the guttural growling and the soft
tramping of many bare-footed men we were pass-
ing through dense primeval forests through occa-
sional openings in the heavy foliage far overhead i
glimpsed the rosy sky and knew that it was early
morning

  and then as from my recumbent position t gazed
about cautiously i saw that which turned my heart
and soul sick with horror for there just a few feet
ahead of me two of the savages carried a sort of
hammock which depended from the strong long pole
on their heavily muscled shoulders and from that
hammock protruded an arm of ivory whiteness most
below the infra red



beautifully modelled and a long slender hand that
i would know anywhere

  the woman in the hammock was ealara

  ealara the beautiful a prisoner of the semi-human
savage pluonians  god what had i done bit-
terly i regretted my damnable curiosity but right
there and then i resolved to save ealara no matter
what the cost

  the cords on my wrists and ankles hurt terribly
but that pain was as nothing compared to the tor-
ment in my soul no doubt she was asleep when the
savages had attacked her because as eloli had ex-
plained to us psychical dominion through the power
of will is far easier during sleep for theri there is no
active will to overcome perhaps it had been the
very savage who had dominated me and had induced
me to open the prison who had overcome her he
was unquestionably a leader among the pluonians
and therefore more powerful mentally than the
others

  hours passed and still the steady tireless march
of the animal-men continued and ever my gaze
returned to that white beautiful arm protruding
from the portable hammock ahead of me swinging
like a pendulum lifelessly until i thought that i
should go insane

  from the occasional glimpses upward through the
dense foliage i knew that it was broad daylight
and yet in the depths of that strange dense prime-
val forest a sort of perpetual twilight prevailed

  despite my soul torment i must have fallen into
a doze from which i awakened as we neared our
destination from ahead savage guttural cries and
piercing yells assailed my ears

  presently we entered a clearing at the foot of a
high black cliff wall along the base of which i per-
ceived a number of irregular openings the largest
being near the middle

  in a moment we were surrounded by a great mob
of nude savage children of all ages and sullen semi-
nude pluonian women who stared at me fiercely
though there was something akin to awe in their
touch of my clothes

  the huge savage who had carried me tossed me
to the ground like a sack of meal the impact jarred
every bone in my body but it cleared my head and
quickened my brain disregarding the mob of sav-
ages crowding about me i exerted myself tremend-
ously and managed to sit up thus i was just in
time to see the hammock with ealara being carried
into the largest cave opening

  dear god- i prayed in my heart -help me
to remedy the evil i have done aid me to free
ealara

  i was lying or rather sitting upon a white crystal-
line ledge of rock that somewhat seemed familiar to
me i allowed myself to sink down again twisted
about and touched my tongue to it experimentally
as i had guessed it was pottassium nitrate but of
such purity as i had never seen on the earth plane

  at this moment the savage who had carried me
returned roughly pushed the crowd of women and
children aside and cut the bonds from my ankles
with a short stone knife which he carried he jerked
me brutally to my feet and pushed me ahead of him
toward the main cave

  several feet within the entrance a great double
curtain of very heavy cloth obstructed our progress

my guard parted the curtains at the middle and
pushed me through following at my heels

  involuntarily i recoiled stepping hard on the toes
of the pluonian behind me who emitted an animal-
like yell for the intense red luminosity of the place
seemed to me for a moment a conflagration

  the immense cave had been hollowed out by the
hand of nature and only in a few places was there
any sign of the touch of man the walls had been
tinted with a luminous bright-red substance as far
up as the eye could see and this was accentuated a
thousandfold by hundreds of fiercely burning torches
that threw an intense red glare everywhere on the
walls and in tall metallic holders the red torches
hissed and spluttered and glared illuminating a
scene truly infernal hellish

with a fierce growl my guide pushed me for-
ward violently so that i almost fell and
now as i walked forward totteringly i became con-
scious of other things in that vast cavern-

  a large crowd of pluonian warriors were assem-
bled about a great throne of a yellow dully gleaming
substance shaped like a huge square block upon
which sat a powerfully built savage cross-legged
with the exception of a broad breechcloth of shiny
cloth and fiery red color and a sort of turban of the
same material he was nude

  behind the throne sculptured out of black stone
its large fiery eyes of a substance akin to ruby
squatted a gigantic idol staring straight ahead with
terror-inspiring intensity its triangular tongue of
crimson protruding several inches from the horrible
gash of a mouth its unspeakably hideous face grin-
ning grinning-a veritable nightmare

  just below the throne was a wide stone platform
and on this my searching eyes perceived the motion-
less white figure of a woman ealara i cried and
attempted to rush forward

  but with a crushing grip my guide grasped my
shoulder and flung me to my knees down worm
he bellowed you are in the presence ofturum
son of uruom that was king of pluonia

  timidly i raised my gaze to the bestial sinister
presence above me and met the brooding fixed stare
of his flaming reddish eyes the menace and evil in
which caused quivers of terror to travel up and
down my spine

  with a tremendous effort of will i managed to
remove my gaze from the terrible fascination of the
flaming eyes and again contemplated the inert form
of the white queen on the platform

  my heart turned sick within me at my absolute
helplessness she seemed dead and only by means
of concentrated attention could t discern the almost
imperceptible rising and falling of her bosom

  suddenly i was conscious of a deep rolling thun-
derous voice above me turum was speaking to the
assembly of savages who pressed all about me nau-
seating me with the odor from their filthy hairy
bodies

  warriors he began to-night pluo the
great spirit of our race commands that i be crowned
king in the stead of my father who is no more

  he paused and his glittering gaze fixed itself upon
the body of ealara greedily rapaciously obscenely
he pointed to her and his evil fiery eyes challenged
his creatures as if he expected opposition at
the celebration she shall become my slave and


amazing stories

he- pointing to me shall be sacrificed in the fire
to piuo i have spoken

  his great hairy fist crashed down upon a sort of
drum that stood by his side and his challenging stare
swept once more over his warriors let him who
objects speak

  but thunderous semi-animal-like shouts of ap-
proval burst from a thousand savage throats as the
warriors slapped themselves upon their hairy chests
with a terrifying noise for emphasis

  amidst savage laughter my guide jerked me bru-
tally to my feet and dragged me into a sort of grotto
immediately adjoining the central cave where he
flung me to the rocky floor cut the remaining bonds
on my wrists and left the place

  for a long time i remained where i had fallen
too miserable to move my heart burned within me
with the terrible realization of the extent of the evil
i had committed out of curiosity and my absolute
helplessness to remedy matters i loved ealara
loved her with every fibre of my being and the
thought of doom filled me with utter despair

  i sank to my knees and prayed with an intensity
that i somehow felt would bring results with a
new hope and renewed strength i rose to my feet
just as one of the pluonians entered with a huge
platter of food and a stone pitcher of some liquid
he placed the food upon a block of the same yellow
substance of which the throne in the main cave was
composed grinned at me evilly and walked out

  with a sudden realization of my hunger i at-
tacked the food it was evidently broiled venison
accompanied by a sort of thick white roasted root
that in taste resembled a potato at first i ate rather
reluctantly but when i found the food surprisingly
palatable i literally gorged myself washing it down
with an occasional draught of water

  while i was eating i noted that the stony block
which served me as table and chair simultaneously
rocked back and forth with my movements glanc-
ing down i observed that small pieces had been
broken off from its lower edge from contact with
the harder stone floor of the grotto casually i
picked up one of the particles and examined it
there could be no mistake-it was native sulphur
of great purity

  and suddenly as i was staring at the sulphur in
my hand there entered into my mind a plan of escape
that left me fairly gasping with excitement for in
a flash i remembered the potassium nitrate outside
which in combination would give gunpowder if

i could obtain some of the nitrate and charcoal-

  in college i had been fairly good at chemistry
and had been quite successful with my experiments
i remembered the formula for gunpowder distinctly
i stealthily crept toward the entrance of the grotto
which was connected with the central cave by means
of a sort of tunnel in the shape of an irregular capi-
tal l the short part being toward the grotto cau-
tiously i peered around the turn just inside of
the outer opening so that he could see what was
going on in the main cave a huge bestial pluonian
stood guard

  his back was toward me silently i crept back
into the grotto with a dim hope i began a tour
of exploration the grotto was very irregular
formed from the black clilt of evident volcanic
origin with many ramifications it seemed discour-
aging just as i was about to give up hope my dili-

gent search was amply rewarded for in the narrow-
est of these branches of the grotto i came upon a
fine outcrop of the nitrate

  with the aid of my dinner knife i managed to
break off a large quantity of the mineral and carried
it to a dish-like cavity in the stone floor which acted
as my mortar in a few moments i had found an
oblong piece of rock that was suited for a pestle
feverishly i set to work grinding the nitrate to a
fine powder

during my grinding operation i began to de-
vise ways and means for obtaining the requisite
amount of charcoal at one side of the grotto was
a sort of heavy mat woven from grasses no doubt
this was to be my bed i concentrated upon this
mat determined that it should furnish me with the
necessary amount of charcoal there were two
flaming red torches against the walls of the grotto
at intervals glowing pieces dropped from them to
the floor where they remained in a glowing state
for quite a while quickly i walked over and pulled
the mat squarely under one of the torches

  how many hours i worked i do not know for
i lost all sense of time but i now had many pounds
of powdered nitrate and sulphur and through care-
ful manipulation nearly the entire upper side of the
straw mat was reduced to charcoal

  i was completely exhausted wearily i dragged
myself to the mat turned it over so that the charred
surface was under me and stretched out on it to
rest a little when i awoke with a start hours later
i found that another meal had been served me while
i slept

  i ate voraciously and as soon as i had finished
my meal i began the milling operation again sev-
eral times i crept to the turn in the passage to spy
upon my guard and found that at intervals of sev-
eral hours new men were at the post evidently
they were certain i could not escape for not once
did anyone enter the grotto to see what i was doing
i praised heaven for that

  suddenly a weird feeling came over me as if an
unseen presence were approaching and even as i
stared incredulously before me there formed a tall
oval fog-like phenomenon growing more luminous
every minute i sprang to my feet and retreated
in alarm and then as i watched in amazement
there quickly materialized before me out of thin
air-loalio

  he smiled benignly and extended his hands to-
ward me in a tranquilizing gesture fear not my
friend i have come to aid you he pointed to
himself as you no doubt understand this is not
my physical body even as yours is not as master
of the laws of nature i am able to leave my physical
body whenever i choose and can travel to any dis-
tance and there clothe myself in a temporary body
composed of electro-magnetic and vito-chemical sub-
stance which is everywhere

  i marveled what wonders were possible to the
soul of man then i quickly acquainted loalio
with the vital facts of the case and showed him the
half finished gun-powder he smiled gravely and
gently shook his head there is no need for that
there are greater forces than chemicals that are
changed into gases through fire or percussion

  he walked over to me and touched my forehead
immediately i seemed to expand all over my body
below the infra red



and experienced a far greater buoyancy than any i
had yet possessed i glanced down at my body and
with a shock realized that i was again invisible as on
the day before when professor winter and i had
entered into this strange world but in a few mo-
ments my vision had become adjusted to the higher
vibration of my body and i could again see both my
own body and that of loalio who had again made
himself invisible to ordinary vision

  with a sign he invited me to follow him we
passed right by the guard of the grotto unnoticed

  it was no doubt evening when we entered the
main cave like two invisible spirits

  turum was being entertained at the foot of the
sulphur throne a large crimson cloth had been spread
on the stone floor and the most conspicuous thing
on this improvised table was an immense wooden
platter placed in the very center in which lay an
entire huge ox-like animal evidently freshly roasted
for it was smoking hot

  at each end the great roast was flanked by smaller
platters containing smaller roasts and there were
still other huge dishes containing heaps of the thick
white boiled root that i myself had eaten and there
were many other unknown edibles in great quantities
great jugs of stone contained liquid refreshment

  in the middle of the spread with his back toward
the throne turum presided at each side of him
and surrounding the cloth this warrior chiefs were
enjoying themselves everywhere about the immense
chamber similar but simpler spreads were placed for
the rest of the warriors-at least two thousand

  table manners were evidently unknown for they
were feeding like a pack of hungry wolves their
method was simple the warriors grasped a con-
venient corner of the roast in front of them with
one hand while with the stone knife in the other
they hacked off whatever they deemed immediately
necessary

  and while the meal was in progress there was
music and dancing and such music and such
dancing seated cross-legged crouching like great
simians and in various recumbent positions the
bestial warriors fed and watched the show

  at one side to the right of tarum was a high
stone platform and on this accompanied by a hor-
rible discordant blatant noise which could hardly be
called music were seven men and seven women
swaying whirling and gyrating in a series of mo-
tions and postures that were vile and obscene

  the orchestra composed of reed pipes great ani-
mal horns and various kinds of drums was seated
at one edge of the platform if anyone can imagine
the combined noise and barbaric discord of a large
chinese orchestra a dozen scotch bagpipes com-
pletely out of tune and a few african tom-toms he
can about imagine the effect

  the whole scene the musicians the glistening
hairy bodies of the dancers the feeding warriors the
guttural deep ape-like tones of approval and shouts
of delight and the crimson bright light tinging every-
thing with a blood-red color might well have repre-
sented a part of the infernal regions

  that horrible crowd resembled the legendary de-
mons of hell as no other creatures could have done

  only a few minutes we stood there contemplating
the nauseating spectacle then my venerated com-
panion touched my arm and pointed to the throne of
sulphur behind the savage king

  i looked and my heart leaped for there upon
the great block of sulphur bedded on shining crim-
son cloth which vividly accentuated her angelic
whiteness i saw the object of my adoration and
love-ealara

unseen and unheard by the savages we quickly
approached the throne and bent over her with
anxious concern apparently she was still in the
grip of the hellish power which during her sleep
had robbed her of her consciousness and self-con-
trol

  with a shudder i realized that she would be held
thus until she had become the plaything of turum
that very night loalio bent down and touched her
forehead with the tips of his fingers of his right
hand with great joy i soon realized that he
rendered her physical body invisible to the savages
both he and i however could see her spiritual body
just as we were able to see each other

  and even as i picked my love up in my arms
at the command of the wise man and carried her
toward the entrance a great shout went up from the
pluonians they had suddenly discovered that their
fair prisoner was missing from the throne

  in a moment the place was in an uproar an in-
ferno of sound

  agitated and driven on by the terrible booming
of turums voice a frantic search was begun ex-
tending to every nook and corner of the vast cavern
torches were torn from their fastenings in order
to facilitate the hunt for the missing royal prisoner

  and through it all serene in our invisible condi-
tion loalio and i quickly made our way to the
screened entrance we had barely reached it when
a sudden thought evidently struck turum that in
some unaccountable manner the royal fugitive might
have made her way out of the main entrance for his
bellow directed the searchers in that direction him-
self leading

  loalio suddenly raised his arms upward with a
waving motion for a moment there was a terrific
atmospheric tension then when the savages were
within a few yards of the entrance a sudden ava-
lanche of rock descended upon them with a terrific
roar burying them from our sight a wild horrible
yell from a thousand savage throats and then-
silence

  as we stepped out into the open the venerable
master touched the rock at the side of the entrance
again i witnessed the phenomenon of rock changing
into a cloud of floating molecules light as breath
the cloud phenomenon now luminous covered the
entire entrance quickly it grew more dense and
when the luminosity disappeared i stared in awe

  where a couple of minutes before had been a great
opening a solid smooth wall of hard impenetrable
rock confronted us

  from the many smaller caves a multitude of older
men women and children emerged streaming to-
ward the former opening to the central cave and
even as we invisible to them moved away the air
was filled and made hideous by their piercing animal
cries and shrieks of astonishment fear and hatred
when they saw the solid rock closing up the former
entrance and simply realized perhaps that something
strange and terrible had entombed their king and
his warriors

  loalio gazed at them a few moments and his


amazing stories

face was stem as he spoke it was a terrible thing
to do but i had no choice in the matter they
would have declared war against alania at once
and perhaps thousands of innocent people would
have had to suffer

  i was still carrying my unconscious love in my
arms and was wondering if loalio would awaken
her from her trance before we continued on our
way when he stopped and looked at me fear not
what you are about to experience but trust me
utterly

  without hesitation i nodded in acquiescence he
placed his right arm firmly about my shoulders and
again his face assumed the fixed intent expression
of intense concentrated mental power

  the next moment i felt myself rising high into the
air and traveling with inconceivable speed

  according to terrestrial time the phenomenon en-
dured barely more than a minute or two i distinctly
got the impression of dark forests open spaces and
rivers receding beneath me in a blurred lightning-
likq procession but was not conscious of wind or
impact against the air and then-suddenly i felt
solid ground beneath my feet i landed softly as
down once more in the garden of the palace of
alania

  elolio and professor winter evidently had ex-
pected our coming and greeted us with sincere de-
light they wanted to relieve me of my precious
burden but i insisted on carrying ealara myself
into her own simple chamber of rest where loalio
broke the evil power which had held her in its grip

  suddenly she opened her wonderful eyes and
gazed in bewilderment first at me and then at the
others a smile transformed her face into tran-
scendent beauty as she raised herself to a sitting pos-
ture

  what has happened  why are all of you act-
ing so strangely she inquired evidently she re-
membered nothing

  and then it was that i sank to my knees and
with humbly bowed head told of my curiosity and
its fatal consequences and begged her pardon for my
contemptible lack of self-control

  softly she placed her hands upon my bowed head
and her voice was like the sweetest music in my
ears my dear dear friend it was but a passing
weakness on your part who am i to condemn
you for it

  when at last i dared to raise my head and gaze
timidly into her eyes t saw such a light of tender-
ness and love radiate from her eyes that i forgot
everything but my great love for her and on the
crest of the tidal wave of my emotion i swept her
a very willing prisoner into my arms only then
did i realize that the others had left us to ourselves

  never had i imagined such rapture and delicious-
ness as i experienced in those never-to-be-forgotten
moments   

  at last t knew as an eternal truth that which the
wise men of humanity the masters of the law have
thought for ages that complete happiness can be
attained only when two perfectly attuned souls of
the opposite sex meet and are united by a bond ever-
lasting a bond that a thousand deaths could not
break a union indissoluble and eternal at last
i had found my soul-mate

  how long we were there in that embrace of utter
bliss i do not know-it might have been minutes

it might have been hours days or eons then sud-
denly an unutterable darkness descended upon my
mind and i had the sensation of falling falling
through a limitless void  i seemed to hear the cry of
my loves fear from an infinite distance and then-
oblivion

barton barton for gods sake answer

  i me

  the words seemed to come from a vast distance
and i became dimly aware that someone was shak-
ing me violently with all my power of will i strug-
gled to throw off the lethargic leaden heaviness that
enthralled me soul and body

  with a tremendous effort i finally managed to
open my eyes to see the anxious face of professor
winter bending over me with his help i man-
aged to sit up and stared about me in a daze

  with a shock it suddenly came to me that we
were in the scientists library i had been lying on
the floor in front of the great mechanical chair from
which i had started on my strange voyage to the
land below the infra-red from which i had evidently
fallen to the floor

  on the other side of me supporting me with
trembling hands was summer the old factotum
of the professor whose staring eyes and pale face
indicated that he had passed through an experience
of intense fear

  what had happened in some unaccountable
manner we had been suddenly re-transferred from
the delightful land of alania to our own drab and
prosaic world

  thank god that you are all right exclaimed
my friend fervently as he drew a deep breath of
relief for a minute i was terribly afraid that
your cardiac action had stopped he added

  what-what on earth has happened t stam-
mered feebly while they helped me to a comfortable
chair i was still very much confused mentally be-
cause of the sudden change

  the scientist seated himself at my side and ex-
plained gently you see-there was a severe elec-
trical storm the lightning struck one of the main
transmission lines and burned out several of the
primary transformers at the nearest sub-station

  naturally this put the whole station out of busi-
ness with the result that all the current was cut
off and the apparatus here stopped he pointed
to the silent machinery on the two tables and con-
tinued 

  as the machines slowed down the vibrations of
our physical bodies in the chairs here decreased in
proportion and came back gradually to normal
which variation in turn was transmitted to our spiri-
tual bodies on the sub-infra-red plane by means of
the invisible cord of magnetism which ever connects
the physical and spiritual bodies until death itself
disrupts it

  now then of course the more normal our vibra-
tions became the more we withdrew from the other
plane of existence and the closer we approached
our terrestrial plane again the attraction between
the physical and spiritual bodies increased gradu-
ally until the soul encased in its spiritual body en-
tered into its earthly shell again and-here we are

  i nodded in slow sad comprehension and so
we are back again in the hum-drum existence of our
own dreary world with a sudden mental wave
below the infra red



of misery i buried my face in my hands and groaned
aloud with disappointment and just as ealara

my wonderful soul-mate and i- my voice

broke and  could not finish

  my companion placed a gentle comforting hand
upon my shoulder dear friend he began with
the deep full tone of genuine sympathy in his voice
i understand but i promise you upon my honor
that as soon as i have prepared a paper for the so-
ciety of psychical research covering our experiences
upon the plane of the sub-infra-red in detail we shall
again venture into the delightful land of the alan-
ians our wonderful and wise friends

  with renewed hope in my heart at the thought
that i would soon be with ealara again i went home
strange how heavy and uncouth my physical body
felt after the delightful lightness and buoyancy of
my spiritual body encased in its covering of sub-
infra-red matter

  at an early hour the next day my telephone rang
wildly i was still in bed sleepily i lifted the
receiver summer was on the wire his voice quiver-
ing and trembling with deep emotion and grief

  mister barton please come at once professor
winter is dying

  i was awake in an instant did t understand
you to say that my friend was dying i cried
horrified

  yes sir it is true doctor evans is with him
now

in a voice choking with emotion i promised to
come at once with lightning speed i began to dress

  i could not bring myself to believe what i had
heard when i had left my friend the day before
he had seemed to be at the maximum of health
strength and energy mentally and physically en-
thusiastic at the prospect of preparing the papers of
our adventures for the society of psychical research

and now-

  summers who was visibly agitated led me straight
to the professors bed-room doctor evans an
elderly and highly capable physician the life-long
friend of professor winter was seated at his bed-
side when i entered

  my scientific friend gazed up at me with a brave
smile as i leaned over him and silently took his
hand

  well- he began in a faint voice -it

seems that the old heart was not able to stand the
strain after all the attack came suddenly about
two hours ago i had been up all night arranging
notes for my manuscript

  he indicated the doctor with a feeble gesture
and his lips twitched humorously frank here savs
its extreme valvular endocarditis i suggested put-
ting in new valves as you would into an automobile
but he did not seem willing so t suppose it means
that the old heart is going to stop soon

  appalled i stared at the doctor who answered
my mute question with a sad nod of his head i
have done all i could i warned him some time ago
but he would not listen

  the dying man spoke to me again but his voice
was much feebler and there was earnest deep ap-
peal in his eyes as i bent down to hear his last
words

  barton before i pass on to the higher world to
continue my studies of the mysteries of nature i
want your promise to do me a very great favor

  i nodded with ready acquiescence certainly
gladly

  he smiled with relief but i had to bend close
to his mouth to hear then since i cannot do it
myself will you promise to acquaint humanity with
our experiences in your own way

  i nodded silently and gave him my hand to em-
phasize my promise i felt his feeble grateful grip
and a few minutes later still retaining his grip on
my hand his great fine soul passed out from its ter-
restrial shell to enter upon his greater finer and
more lofty labors and duties in the world beyond

the statement of dr evans

a short time after the demise of my dearly
esteemed life-long friend professor carl
winter his servant carl summer who pend-
ing the settlement of the professors estate had been
left in charge of the latters residence called me up
on the telephone and begged me to hurry over to the
house as something very terrible had happened

  when i arrived summer who was in a mental
state bordering upon collapse conducted me to the
library where i found mr john barton a friend
of the professor with whom he had conducted some
secret experiments of importance seated in a large
chair of peculiarmechanical construction in an at-
titude which at once indicated to me that he was
dead

  he had on a head-dress which resembled an avi-
tors cap with exceptionally heavy goggles a num-
ber of wires ran from- the front and sides of the
cap to a complicated apparatus at his right hand
upon a table of very massive construction

  there were two of these chairs and mechanical
tables the old servant pointed to the apparatus
and there was positive intense hatred in his eyes and
voice as he cried 

  its a devil machine sir and it killed both
professor winter and his friend

  my immediate thorough examination corroborated
beyond all doubt my first conclusion that mr barton
was really dead

  summer upon being questioned stated that bar-
ton had that day come and had immediately gone
to the library a few minutes later the old servant
had heard him start the machinery on the table
having a premonition of disaster he had crept to
the closed door and had tremblingly listened

  suddenly there had been a loud shriek from the
machinery and a horrible groan from barton
wrenching open the door summer had rushed in-
side and had pulled out the main switch on the wall
which he knew controlled the machinery but he
had been too late something had gone wrong with
the machinery and it had cost barton his life

  the very next day i received a bulky registered
package by mail from barton dated a day earlier
the package included a manuscript and a letter which
explained many things

  evidently barton knew that he was going to his
death for he had left his entire fortune to charity
and before his fatal experiment had written the
entire manuscript in compliance with the dying re-
quest of my friend professor winter

in his letter to me barton requested me to publish

the manuscript he had written and told me that	to both barton and my dear friend professor win-

he was going to try to reach his soul mate the	ter and must let the world judge the merit or

woman he loved on the plane below the infra-red	demerit of the case

 i have carried out the request as a sacred trust	signed frank evans md

their places notwithstanding the speed of the ship
they watched these colossal masses which seemed to
be running away from the aeronef

as to pass into india

  so much the worse answered uncle prudent
on that immense territory we shall perhaps be able
to-

  unless he goes round by burmah to the east or
nepaul to the west

  anyhow i defy him to go through them

  indeed said a voice

  the next day the th of june the albatross
was in front of the huge mass above the province
of zang on the other side of the chain was the
province of nepaul these ranges block the road
into india from the north the two northern ones
between which the aeronef was gliding like a ship
between enormous reefs are the first steps of the
central asian barrier the first was the kuen lung
the other the karakorum bordering the longitudi-
nal valley parallel to the himalayas from which the
indus flows to the west and the brahmapootra to the
east

  what a superb orographical system more than
two hundred summits have been measured seven-
teen of which exceed twenty-five thousand feet in
front of the albatross at a height of twenty-nine
thousand feet towered mount everest to the right
was dhawalagiri reaching twenty-six thousand eight
hundred feet and relegated to second place since the
measurement of mount everest

  evidently robur did not intend to go over the top
of these peaks but probably he knew the passes of

was not such as to necessitate recourse being had to
the special apparatus for renewing the oxygen in the

  robur stood in the bow his sturdy figure wrapped
in a great-coat he gave the orders while tom
turner was at the helm the engineer kept an at-

running at the full strength of the current gave
forth a note of intense shrillness in spite of the low
density of the air the barometer showed twenty-
three thousand feet in altitude

  magnificent was the grouping of the chaos of
mountains everywhere were brilliant white sum-
mits there were no lakes but glaciers descending
ten thousand feet towards the base there was no
herbage only a few phanerogams on the limit of
vegetable life down on the lower flanks of the
range were splendid forests of pines and cedars
here were none of the gigantic ferns and inter-
minable parasites stretching from tree to tree as in
the thickets of the jungle there were no animals
-no wild horses or yaks or thibetan bulls occa-
sionally a sacred gazelle showed itself far down the
slopes there were no birds save a couple of those
crows which can rise to the utmost limits of the
respirable air

  the pass at last was traversed the albatross
began to descend coming from the hills out of

editor amazing stories

  i am an interested reader of your amazing
stories and not to take up too much of your
valuable time i will be brief

  in the story around the universe by ray
cummings the author fails to take any account
of the high speed effect of his space flier on
the vibrations of light

  if the rate of red vibrations is to that of violet
as  a speed of  miles per second would
cause the light coming from ahead to reach up
into the ultra-violet scale and the light of the world

behind would sink down the scale and be smothered
in infra-red darkness to reappear again ahead
as the flier is cutting the vibrations from behind
with increase of speed these vibrations would
rise in the scale until they too would disappear
beyond the ultra-violet furthermore catching up
with the vibrations and cutting them the reverse
way would make the world they were leaving
seem to recede ahead there would be several
more fantastic developments e g in the case of
the light coming in at an angle

  yet at the rate of  miles per second

 i the author has the stars ahead open up and sepa
 rate and close up again behind

   at that rate and a higher one the creator alone
 knows what the increased vibrations would do to
 the electrons and protons that are supposed to con-
 stitute the atoms of a flyer or any people therein

   for the next trip cummings might fix up -a
 speedometer out of the spectroscope and a delicate
 gravitational indicator might serve to indicate the

 fourth dimension stories and in-
 terplanetary voyaging asked for

 editor amazing stories

    will you let a longhorn texan horn in on
 the letters from the readers column i have
 been reading amazing stories since the first issue
 indeed it is the only fiction magazine that i read
 regularly wild west stories and the old thread-
 bare love plots long ago ceased to thrill me i be-
 gan searching for out-of-the-ordinary stories in
 libraries and in the current magazines i soon read
 all of wells verne defoe poe and the few other
 older classic writers of this type of story and i
 began wishing that some enterprising editor would
 publish a magazine featuring this kind of story
 amazing stories is a very satisfactory materializa-
 tion of this wish

    i have just finished reading ray cummings
 around the universe and found it not only enter-
 taining but artistic in the extreme from the stand-
 point of short story technique the dream character
 of sir isaac impersonating the well-known writers
 of scientifiction was entirely pleasing however it
 seems to me that mr cummings overstepped the
 bounds of good science-or even dream science-
 when he placed a solid encompassing shell about the
 atom to have had the professor tubby and
 aiheena plunge into the realm of empyrean fire
 of the old ptolemaic theorists would have been just
 as scientific but no matter mr cummings suc-
 ceeded in f putting over some good lessons in
 astronomy in a little more pleasing language than
 one usually finds in textbooks

    of all the stories published in our magazine to
  date i liked serviss the second deluge best
  being an astronomer myself in a more or less ama-
  teurish sort of way i know mr serviss as an au-
  thority on modern astronomy as well as a weaver
  of charming tales at least one such serial a year
  from the pen of mr serviss would greatly enhance
  the value of the magazine to me i think the read-
  ers are also fortunate in getting the new stories of
  h g wells-as well as his older stuff i consider
  mr wells one of the most far-sighted thinkers of
  our age his ability to forecast scientific progress
  and achievement of the future is almost uncanny
  as evidenced by some of his older scientifiction
  novels such as when the sleeper awakes and
  the war in the air and short stories like
  armageddon in the days of the comet etc

    only one story has appeared in amazing stories
  so far that i could not seem to like that was red
  dust in fact i much prefer stories like the
  visitation in which the whole theme is optimistic
  and the destiny of the human race is painted in
  brighter colors dont we see enough of the morbid
  in real life without bringing it too forcibly into
  fiction after all isnt it just as probable that an
  invading race from mars or venus would bring
  good to the world as bad

    please give us more fourth dimensional stories
  i consider this one of the most interesting subjects
  of modern science relativity and the fourth
  dimension have already radically changed our scien-
  tific thought what our ideas and conceptions of
  the universe will be one hundred years hence no
  one can say but it is a safe bet such conceptions
  will be molded to a great extent by relative and
  ultra-three-dimensional mathematics

    in closing may i repeat that amazing stories
 fills a long felt want in my reading diet may it
 prosper and grow far into the future of which its
 authors dream may it be a true prophet of scien-
 tific achievements to come as its sister gernsback
 publications have been

                              sterling bunch

                              fort worth tex

    we firmly believe that if the stories we publish
  were restricted to absolute fact with the imagina-
  tion of the authors permitted to go only into the
  realm of cold actuality much of the interest of
  amazing stories would vanish

    we are surprised at your views of the story
 the red dust even if it is not optimistic the
 majority of our readers found a good deal of charm
 in the presentation of the primitive life and in the
 suggestion which it carried of a future develop-
 ment and of the process of education through the
 generations-editor

 the semi-monthly magazine-more
 about ray cummings universe

 editor amazing stories

   i have been wanting to write you and commend
 you on your wonderful magazine for some time
 but owing to my inability to type fast i have no
 attempted it

   before i say anything i wish to emphasize mj
 desire for a semi-monthly magazine in your oc-
 tober issue raymond jaureguy gives a reason for
 not putting the magazine out twice a month which
 is that in the average home five dollars a year is
 too large a sum to pay for a magazine

    as you say that a greater part of the magazines
  circulation is at the news stands i am sure that
  those who buy it every month could dig up twenty-
  five cents twice a month instead if they appreciate
  the stories as much as discussions testify what
  do you think mr editor

   i never dare to bring an issue of amazing
 stories to school as i have done because i know
 that i would have very little left to read myself
 when the day is ended

and now for a bit to say about the stories them-

  egotistical i myself had the same idea about the
  universe which ray cummings wrote about in his
  story around the universe i thought that we
  might possibly be on what is a speck of dust in a
  greater stupendously more large sphere than the
  one which we proudly call ourselves of we might
  be floating around with our little world in the space
  between the air molecules of the other worlds at-
  mosphere what is a million years of time in our
  universe may be a split fraction of a second to
  them

    again their world may be a speck of dust in an-
  other in relative proportion of their size to us and
  so on forever food for thought

    the question of publishing the magazine twice a
  month seems to be a very open one with many
  pros and cons but the semi-monthly magazine will
  not be started for some time to come your appre-
  ciation of ray cummings story is of interest in
  view of the fact that another correspondent has
  taken up the same subject with equal interest-
  editor

    amazing stories on the news
 stands
 editor amazing stories

    having been a reader of your magazine amaz-
 ing stories for over a year i have always re-
 membered the date on which the monthly issue is
 due to appear on the news stands and have not
 missed a single copy since i first began reading it
 perhaps you wonder why i do not subscribe and
 save the trouble of having to go to the news stand
 for my copy that is because i am constantly trav-
 eling from one place to another and it would give
 you too much trouble in changing my address how-
 ever no matter where i am once i get my copy
 of amazing stories i do not let even a train
 wreck or a motor accident disturb my interest in
 finishing one of the stories contained in its pages
 come what may

    for some time i have followed the discussions
 concerning authors stories suggestions etc con-
 tained in the pages of amazing stories and have
 noticed that there seems to be an eagerness toward
 having you publish amazing stories twice a
 month with all kinds of suggestions as to the
 how much as the publishers of the magazine
 would like to do this and there is no doubt that
 they could secure sufficient material surely it would
 hardly be practical inasmuch as the magazine is
 hardly two years old contains so few advertise-
 ments and is not vet paying for itself if i under-
 stand this correctly i am quite sure that the
 publication of amazing stories once a month is
 really remarkable considering the difficulties it had
 to start out with and is still encountering if folks
 would give it time i am sure it will advance
 slowly but surely into one of the outstanding sci-
 entific publications yet to come provided this will
 be true i do not believe that its present readers
 will mind waiting a while until it is announced that
 amazing stories is paying for itself advertisers
 are a good deal more confident in it and above
 all ye editor will be considering printing it twice
 a month

    there is another thing i would like to say in
 regard to amazing stories as it is now and that
 is that the style of type used is very plain and
 readable the illustrations well placcd and every
 page neat and attractive to the eye it has been
 the practice of other magazines as they grow older
 to change the size of type and often in doing so
 low subscribers accustomed to the old form of plain
 and readable type though in time you may re-
 arrange your forms and illustrations  think it
 would be unwise to swftch to a different kind of
 type as the present kind is excellent

    so far i have not commented upon or perhaps
 dropped a hint of criticism concerning your stories
 or authors but i may some other time who knows

                             joseph c collins
                                    lakewood o

    we are glad that our correspondent approves of
  our very clear and readable type legibility is of
  course a great thing and we shall certainly keep
  it in mind as a permanent feature of amazing
  stories-editor

 good chemists command high salaries

 t oconor sloane

ab am lld phd

 noted instructor lecturer and
 author formerly treasurer ameri-
 can chemical society and a practical
 chemlit with many well known
 achievements to bis credit not
 only has dr sloane taught chemu
 try for years but he was for many
 years engaged in commercial chemis-
 try work

 and you can make yourself independent for
 life by unearthng one of chemistrys yet
 undiscovered secrets

 do you remember how the tales of pirate gold used to fire
 your imagination and make you want to sail the uncharted
 seas in search of treasure and adventure and then you
 would regret that such things were no longer done but that
 is a mistake they are done-today and everyday-not on
 desert islands but in the chemical laboratories throughout
 your own country quietly systematically the chemist works

 his work is difficult but more adventurous than the blood-
 curdling deeds of the spanish main instead of meeting an
 early and violent death on some forgotten shore he gathers
 wealth and honor through his invaluable contributions to hu-
 manity alfred nobel the swedish chemist who invented
 dynamite made so many millions that the income alone from
 his bequests provides five  prizes every year for the
 advancement of science and peace c m hall the chemist
 who discovered how to manufacture aluminum made millions
 through this discovery f g cottrell who devised a valu-
 able process for recovering the waste from flue gases james
 gaylev who showed how to save enormous losses in steel
 manufacture l h baekeland who invented bakelite-these
 are only a few of the men to whom fortunes have come
 through their chemical achievements

   now is the time to study chemistry

                     not only are these boundless opportunities for amassing
                     wealth in chemistry but the profession affords congenial
                     employment at good salaries to hundreds of thousands who
                     merely follow out its present applications these appli-
                     cations aro innumerable touching intimately every busi-
                     ness and evory product in the world the work of the
                     chemist can hardly be called work at all it is the
                     keenest and most enjoyable kind of pleasure tho days
                     in a chemical laboratory are tilled with thrilling and
                     delightful experimentation with the alluring prospect of
                     a discovery that may spell fortune always at hand to
                     spur your enthusiasm

 what some of our students
 say of this course

   i hare not written since i received the big
  set i can still say that it far exreeded my
  anticipations since i have been studying with
  your school i have been appointed chemist for
  the scranton coal co testing all the coal and
  ash by proximate analysis the lessons are
  helping me wonderfully and the interesting way
  in which they aro written make me wait pa-
  tiently for each lesson-morlals coujien

    wish to express my appreciation of your
  prompt reply to my letter and to tho recom-
  mendation to the general electric co  in-
  tend to start the student engineering course at
  the works this is somewhat along electrical
  lines but the fact that i had a recommenda-
  tion from a reliable school no doubt had con-
  siderable influence in helping me to secure the
  job- h van hkntuuyhen

   so far ive been mon than pleased with
  your course and am still doing nicely i hope
  to be your honor graduate this year-j m
  norkus jr

    and your course excellent and your instruc-
  tion truthfully the clearest and best assem-
  bled i have ever taken and yours is the flfth
  one ive studied-james j kelly

   from the time i was having chemistry it
  has never been thus explained to me as it it
  now i am recommending you highly to my
  friends and urging them to become members
  of such an organisation-charles ben-
  jamin

   i shall always recommend your scliool to my
  friends and let them know how simple your les-
  sons are-c j amdahl

   i am more than pleased you dig right in
  from the start  am going to get somewhere
  with this course i am so glad that i found
  you-a a cameron

   i use your lessons constantly as i find it
  more thorough than most text books i ran

criticism of authors artists and
subjects suggestions for reprints

editor amazing stories

  having perused each number of amazing stories
from cover to covcr sincc the first issue i feel
entitled to offer some criticisms

  the binding of the magazines in recent months
is disgraceful i save my copies but am hindered
by the fact that they fall apart before half read
please use a binding that will hold the book together
and  am sure that a rrcat many readers will be
the better pleased

  another thing that i find abominable is the illus-
trations i am in favor of plenty of pictures but
not such lifeless and inanimate imitation cartoons
such as you have been using they dont even
look like drawings of statues you should get an
artist who would put a little life in his sketches

  the authors are good but somewhat overdone
ii g wells is a big favorite with me but you
overexploit him you have not printed an issue
yet that failed to contain some wells give some-
one else a chance

merritt is good but too imaginative give us
something that is more in line with known science

  the verne stories are all right but they sound
too old and have too much of a dry journalistic
flavor  wont weep if you drop him

  keep burroughs out of amazing stories lie
is too imaginative and entirely too romantic and
not much real science am getting sick of reading
of a man going to some other planet or to the
middle of the earth or to some forsaken jungle
always to find the same thing-some beauty
among the savages i have read wholly or partly
every story that burroughs has written before i
knew better and find him to be the most magnificent
liar i have seen in print

  cummings also has an abominable habit of going
into out-of-the-way placcs for his heroines once or
twice is all right but for the love of pete make
it the rule to keep em on the earth they sound
a little too improbable away from home

  the comic invention stories are poor too much
stress is laid on the humor part with the result
that the tales get quite ridiculous they are noth-
ing more than rank imitations of edgar franklins
old hawkins stories of  years ago anyway
if these tales were dropped ill bet that the circu-
lation would advance enormously

  how about shaking up the bag a little so that
we could get a few new stories the reprints are
very good but yo i should give the other stories a
chance this kick is aimed at the longer stories
it would be much better if you at least alternated
a new serial with an old one of  issues you
have put out to date and the annual only two
numbers have been completely new to me

  speaking of reprints i should like to suggest
a few that i should be glad to meet again the
planeteer and its sequel king of conserve
island are the best interplanetary stories  have
ever read thev were in all-story weekly in
- and could easily be run in two issues
the brain blight and the house of sorcery
by jack harrower all-story  are also very
good unsight-unseen all-story  is a
wholesome hum or story and as good an invisibility
story as i have seen i should especially like to
see the mastodon-milk-man by c mac lean
savage as i never read its conclusion edgar
franklins the amiable aroma is another good
scientific humor yarn how about the blind
spot by austin hall and homer eon flint
philip m fisher has also written a couple of good
ones which are short the powder of midas
by ben ames williams belongs in amazing stories

  prof serviss seems to have published a story
somewhere in  entitled the conquest of
mars t have been unable to trace this story
but should like to read it could you give me a
little assistance in finding this story somewhere

  you have added a good author in garrett smith
i have read some of his stories and they are very
fair

  the suggestion of a scientific club is very good
and it would be a great thing were its purpose
carried out

  there should be in cither science and invention
or amazing stories a page devoted to a scientific
problem or theory there should be a problem
submitted in each issue with prizes given for the
best problem submitted and for the best solution
given someone could give a theory on the solu-
tion to some question undecided by science which
if plausible should be put up for argument with
a prize for the best argument for or against the
theory

  this thing is getting drawnout and i cant think
of any further razzberries or medals to issue so
i guess its time to close with hopes for a bigger
and better twice-a-month amazing stories the
best magazine in print

  the task of pleasing thousands of readers is
one which cannot be carried out to a state of
completeness the authors which this correspond-
ent complains of and the interplanetary travel
stories which he objects to are exactly what are
liked and appreciated by a great number of the
greater proportion of our readers we have re-
ceived and published numbers of letters commend-
ing the very things which are found fault with in
this letter but we want letters of criticism and

  the young mens science club

 editor amazing storiks

    on reading the october issue of amazing stories
 i came across your answer to my letter concern-
 ing the young mens science club and i want to
 thank you for all the nice things you say about
 it i am glad to hear that you will back up the
 club with your fullest power  want to say this
 that with a magazine such as amazing stories be-
 hind the new club we cant lose

    by making amazing stories the official organ of
 the club you have killed two birds with one stone
 as the saying goes it will help the club and help
 to enlarge the circulation of amazing stories to a
 great extent



    i am doing my bit to help the new proposed club
 get started by telling my friends about it and ex-
 plaining to them the advantages of such a club

  i think that if all those that arc interested in such
  a club would tell their friends about it they would
  be helping out the new club immensely

    you can count on me to back up the new club as
  well as your magazine amazing stories to the
  utmost

    now before i close i would like to say a few
 words about your magazine i have read quite a
 lot about this twice-a-month idea and i want to
 say this please dont make amazing stories a
 twice-a-month magazine because many magazines
 have been spoiled because they have come out too
 often i dont want such a thing to happen to
 amazing stories as it cant be beat as it is today

   wishing your magazine innumerable years of
 prosperity  remain

    i we are glad to see the young mens science

 idea which must be carried out by the efforts of its
 members it is not to be directed as a ship by one
 person but it must be a republic in the fullest sense
 of the word everybody must have a part in it

    it is interesting to find some of our correspond-
  ents opposed to the twice-a-month idea in any case
  that is far in the future at present we have all
  we can do to meet the almost too favorable views

 editor amazing stories

    i must confess that when i fiist read your excel-
  lent magazine i felt that the stories were rather
  far-fetched and with each number i had doubts
  that i would want to read the next as time went
  on however i found myself unconsciously looking
  forward to the tenth of the month when amazing
  stories appears on the stands here i hope that
  by being a subscriber  will now get it a few
  days earlier i find most of your stories very en-
  tertaining as well as instructive stories of the
  unknown hold wonderful possibilities for mystery
  and romance

    i have always been highly interested by pseudo-
  scientific talcs especially of travel to other planets
  as i am a deep student of astronomy i believe
  your best stories have been reprints from wells
  verne serviss and burroughs although the lattcrs
  work hardly belougs in your magazine some of
  your readers have complained of slight lapses in
  the scientific construction of plots others have com-
  plained of unnecessary detail and too much descrip-
  tion i feel that we can easily afford to overlook
  a few discrepancies in science in such entertaining
  fiction for example burroughs combining the mam-
  mal and reptile in the same animal his evolution
  from reptile eggs to apes and then human beings
  all in one lifetime in the green splotches the
  men from jupiter who were plants and received
  nourishment from the sunlight although plants of
  any consequence certainly plants as large and heavy
  as human beings receive their nourishment from
  chemicals in the ground through roots i found
  ray cummings around the universe a very
  clever humorous story teaching us a lot about
  astronomy even if tubbvs journey was made pos-
  sible through the simple expedient of wishing for a
  space machine

    to my mind the thing that makes a scientifiction
  story worth while is not so much strict adherence
  to science as it is describing in such minute detail
  conditions in the new world or in the new state
  of affairs as to bring a picture of reality to the
  mind of the reader i dont know of any story i
  enjoyed more than wells time machine his
  wealth of detail in presenting conditions attending
  the trip into the future was what made the story
  seem plausible and real

    i am very much interested in the proposed young
  mens science club and ask that you enroll me as
  a member if possible although i am a little past
  the age limit suggested i would greatly enjoy taking
  part in scientific

  our correspondent carries out exactly some of
  our ideas which we have been giving in our dis-
  cussion columns when our correspondent started
  with our magazine he felt that the stories were
  rather far-fetched and here we wish to state that
  they are not only far-fetched but that the charm of
  the magazine lies partly in this very quality this
  correspondent follows up amazing stories and
  when he speaks of the wonderful possibilities for
  mystery and romance in stories of the unknown
  to use a proverbial expression he puts the whole
  thing in a nut-shell he likes burroughs wells
  and ray cummings and we are glad to see that
  their work has excited his imagination to the
  degree of making him a critic of the possibilities
  of the various statements

  we firmly believe that if our stories were solid
  matter of fact they would cease to be amazing
  -and people like to be amazed-editor

an explanation from one of
our authors

 editor amazing stories

    being a burroughs admirer i rather resented
 those people who knocked him because of his so-
 called hatred of the germans as i was curious
 i wrote him and in return received a very nice
 letter quoting his letter in regard to the ger-
 mans he says

    i am very sorry that a couple of my stories
 have given the impression that i do not like ger-
 mans these stories were written when the feeling
 against the germans was very high in this country
 and to the tremendous amount of anti-german
 propaganda during the war i realize now that
 much of this was exaggerated and i know that it
 docs not do any of us any good to foster enmity
 and hatred

    i call this a clear explanation and would like to
  have it published keep up the good work in
  amazing stories try some of edgar allan poe
  and try the purple sapphire by john faine

                              john w bell
 whitman mass
 any story written during the world war is
 bound to seem prejudiced and we arc glad to get
 mr burroughs very clear statement to you-
 editor	

the discussions column and critics
who write some of the letters

 editor amazing stories

    i have been reading your magazine for over a
 year now and i enjoy it very much the moon
 pool is in my estimation one of the best stories
 you have published the authors power of inter-
 esting and enthralling description as well as nar-
 ration was exceptionally good the second del-
 uge was another fine story i dont like the grue-
 some tales very well but they are all right in
 moderation i enjoyed around the universe even
 if it is a reprint i have no fault to find with any
 of your reprints the treasures of tantalus
 had me very delicately balanced on the front edge
 of my chair and the discussions column is a
 source of real enjoyment im going to talk a little
 to both you and your correspondents now

    i agree with mr lucy of palo alt in his com-
  ment on the critics who seem disappointed to
  think that they can find flaws in the stories the
  author has to have a joker in the deck or he would
  be accused of everything from insanity to treason
  furthermore if the stories were true they would
  be in the newspapers and would be quite common
  potatoes it puts me in mind of those who view
  with alarm the atlantic and pacific flights calling
  them the exploits of fools i refer to the suc-
  cessful ones it makes me think of some other
  fools like the wright brothers and so on

    i have always had much the same ideas that mr
  hale of california has although i never dared air
  them for fear of ridicule a person is truly pos-
  sessed of a wonderful conceit it it will allow them
  to declare that this dust speck of an earth is the
  only inhabited world in the universe

    i am much amused at miss morans fearful pur-
 chase of the cheap fiction which she tells of in
 the october issue i am sorry to say that amazing
 stories is considered cheap fiction by a good
 many people if i may venture to i will suggest
 that your cover is responsible i myself find noth-
 ing wrong but my friends have told me that if the
 cover were a little less wild there would be less
 chance of people getting the cheap fiction impres-
 sion my mother also suggests better paper and
 illustrations on a par with the american magazine
 and others of that type i also heartily agree with
 miss morans final paragraph if you can turn
 some brilliant and fertile mind    into rivers of
 knowledge that it might otherwise have overlooked
 and thus assist in giving to the world a genius
 you will have more than justified the existence of
 amazing stories and stolen a big march on the
 prejudiced

amazing stories

  about a pro antj con department in discussions
  i think that is a good idea and will prove very
  interesting to the readers of the magazine

   i am in favor of the rib ticklers put out by
 messrs skinner and simmons and i utterly dis-
 agree with mr sarason of new york city in his
 letter in the october issue funny stories like the
 ones in question are in my oipinion very acceptable
 they give you a chance to catch your breath and
 indulge in a hearty laugh

     will sign oil ntw with a final admonitio t
  against a semi-monthly magazine in the first
  place it would boost the price too much and in
  the second place a steady diet of any one thing
  becomes palling

 soon be on a paying basis

    we spare no effort to get excellent stories and
  stories strictly in the line of the fiction of science
  for our very appreciative readers

   to our mind in the moon pool the descrip-
 tion of the characters is most vivid especially that
 of the irishman with his strange mixture of spir-
 ituality and every-day existence we arc getting
 such interesting letters from our correspondents
 that our discussion section bids well to be a very
 interesting part of our magazine we make no
 effort to publish only favorable letters and do not
 omit the unfavorable ones the latter are most in-
 teresting and valuable as regards our illustrations

 mendation from our readers-editor



  thetarzan idea in the daily press

   editor amazing stories

   i enclose in this letter a newspaper clipping
   which i thought might be of some interest to you
   and to some of the readers of your splendid maga-
   zine amazing stories the story was clipped
   from the september th edition of the memphis
   tenn commercial appeal it may not be worth
   very much but it verifies some of your statements
   concerning imossible things

   many persons after reading edgar rice bur-
   roughs tarzan books may have the opinion that
   the subject is just a little far-fetched this is not
   so the tarzan idea is now an established fact
   as may be seen from reading the clipping

   the stories in amazing stories are all very
   interesting and the editorials more so i am very
   well pleased with the magazine and must con-
   gratulate the editors and staff on the efforts they
   have put forth in making amazing stories a suc-
   cess with its readers

   i am indied surprised to learn that the maga-
   zine is not on a paying basis yet this is a verv
   disagreeable fact and i sincerely hope that this will
   not affect the publication of the magazine

baboon boy discovered in south
africa report
captured by troopers after fierce fight and
taken by english family-now groton man

but retains traces of good old days

      london sept -tarzan has come true
   and kiplings mowgli who was reared by
   the wolves is not so far-fetched as adult read
   ers may suppose according to the report which
   has just reached here from johannesburg
   south africa of the discovery of a baboon
   boy

     according to the story a south african
   native baby teas kidnaped from his kraal by
   baboons was eared for by a baboon foster
   mother for years and spent a large period of
   his boyhood roaming the wilds with the troop

      about  years ago two troopers of the old
   cape police were making their way through
   wild country in southeast cape province when
   they came on a troop of baboons they fired
   at them and the troop scampered away but
   one monkey who tailed off at the rear seemed
   to be wounded the troopers galloped up to
   the laggard and to their astonishment found
   instead of a baboon a well-groum native boy
   hopping along on all-fours after his departed
   associates

      when they came to close quarters with the
   boy he scratched and bit them fiercely and
   put up a hard fight before he was overpowered
   his naked state made it exceedingly difficult
   for the troopers to get a firm grip on him

      all efforts to trace the captives parentage
   proved futile he was therefore handed over
   to the authorities of a mental hospital in a
   neighboring town where he was kept for a
   year and given the name of lucas the boy
   was unable to talk and showed a great dislike
   for orthodox human food rato meats and
   prickly pears proved to be his favorite diet and
   his appetite was enormous though mischiev-
   ous he turned out not to be vicious and was
   soon won to those about him by kindness but
   it was found extremely difficult to make him
   walk upright

      attempts were made to place the boy with
   some one who would undertake to tram him
   finally g h smithy the owner of a large
   farm in the bathurst district of the cape prov-
   ince heard of lucas and so some  years
   ago the baboon boy came under the care of
   his present employer

mr smith at first teas worried about the
task he had undertaken but lucas had by this

   time lost his original dislike of human beings
   and was a comparatively docile native boy
   though still possessing odd monkeylike manner-
   isms the boy was found to be covered with
   scars which looked as though they were the
   result of bites one leg had apparently been
   broken years before but had been extremely
   iveil set on top of his head was a semi-
   circular scar which lucas when he learned to
   talk said was the result of a kick from an
   ostrich

      iucas can only speak english as his duties
   bring him into contact mostly with only his
   master and mistress he is very fond of
   children and his special delight is to take carc
   of his employers little ones today mr smith
   would not exchange his one-time doubtful bar-
   gain for any other two native workers

     lucas docs not mind talking about what he
   remembers of his boyhood with the baboons
   he tells how one big baboon used to take him
   in its arms on cold nights and put him warmly
   to sleep in the undergrowth of the bush and
   of how edible crickets were collected from the
   ground to appease the pangs of ever-present
   hunger on request lucas will even go down
   on all fours and give an exhibition of how
   he marched with the baboon herd

      there is one characteristic of his he has not
   been able to shake off he has absolutely no
   sense of time sun-up and sun-dozon mean
   nothing to him and he must alxvays be called
   to do a certain thing at the appointed hour
   when he laughs there is more than a sugges-
   tion of the monkey shrillness in his tone his
   features too are particularly simian when seen
   in profile

      but lucas holds no brief for baboons nowa-
   days there is one on mr smiths farm which
   was captured in babyhood and has been
   petted to middle-age by an indulgent household
   lucas howevert is scarcely on speaking terms
   with it	john m sturm

   we arc giving at full length the article fro
   the commercial appeal of memphis tenn

   it is hard to believe that the story is authent
   but it certainly reads very well-editor

an interesting criticism from
critical reader

 editor amazing stories

    it is very seldom that i read magazine stori
  as i consider the majority of them too plebiar
  i much prefer spending my time reading roma
  rolland and fyodor dostoievsky it was purt
  an accident that i discovered amazing stories a
  now i purchase it along with vanity fail
  time and polo each month

    because i am not ordinarily a magazine read
  i am taking the liberty of writing you to say h
  very much i have enjoyed amazing stories
  few months ago when my regiment went into t
  field for the annual target practice i took a co
  of your magazine with me and recommend
  green splotches to a friend of mine he 
  joyed the story very much and the result was tl
  the magazine was very much in demand and
  practically had to run a rostor on it

   however i must admit that i do not read
 the stories in each issue as there are only a c
 tain number that appeal to me i had read
 war of the worlds and the time machir
 a long time ago and they arc the type i c
 for i gave the moon pool a fair trial but 
 not bother to finish it it promised well in
 beginning but turned into a childs fairy t
 however there was no doubt but that it was v
 written and filled with plenty of science

    i might suggest that a plainer or at least a m
  simple cover would be more appropriate as it wo
  set amazing stories above the plane of tcrri
  magazines that line the newsstands with their h
  raising pictures

   are contributions from your readers welcon
 and if i should submit one of the stories i h
 written would it receive a frank criticism

                        frank carpenter jr
  lieutenant th f a
  fort sam houston te
  all this criticism from a very competent ci
  needs no commcnt from us in answer to the qi
  tion at the end we can only say that contributi
  from our readers are very welcome and we
  give a full examination and criticism to any st
  which our reader submits-editor 

a list of favorite stories

 editor amazing stories

   although not a subscriber to amazing stoi
 i have a complete set from its birth to the pro
 date my opinion is that it is far ahead of
 other magazines containing scientifiction stories

   my favorite stories up to date were a 
 to the center of the earth the star 
 malignant entity station x the man 
 could work miracles moon metal a col
 bus of space beyond the pole blasphctr
 plateau the second deluge the first 
 in the moon through the craters rim 
 man who could vanish the land that 
 forgot the green splotches the pcoplt
 the pit the plague of the living dead 
 moon pool and the war of the worlds 
 installment i also liked the scientific ad
 tures of mr fosdick and doctor hackcns
amazing stories



secrcts i would like more stories by a merritt
all of his stories interested me

  one thing i would like would be for amazing
stories to come out twice a month when this
docs happen i know its readers will be delighted

   would like to see amazing stories prosper
and herewith i give a little advice whether it may
be right or wrong each month the cover of
amazing stories is very attractive i am sure
if the magazine dealers would place a copy of
the magazine in a display window where the
public jcould sec it more would be sold the
cover would attract them but in most magazine
stores it is partly concealed by other magazines

  wishing amazing stories the best of

  our readers must acknowledge that we publish
letters on the basis of their interest and suggestive-
ness irrespective of whether they praise or criticize
unfavorably what we look for and hope for is
constructive letters not only from readers who arc
sometimes as we know too favorable in their
criticisms so that the editors van be helped in their
work all we can say about our correspondent is
that he has picked out a number of stories which
have met with our decided approval and which
give us a comforting feeling that amazing stories
has done well for its readers-editor

          a fair critic
editor amazing stories

  when i first picked up your magazine and
glanced at the cover i saiu amazing stories 
why not fairy stories-- and my brother and i
laughed together but although im irish ill
admit defeat and after id read your selection of
incredible facts and read a few stories  became
intensely interested and now im a devoted reader

   wish to make a criticism however but its
about the subscribers when i read the discus-
sions  was impressed by the fact that the readers
bickered back and forth among themselves and
criticised each other for their impressions every-
one is entitled to his own ideas why not every-
one write his criticism and leave the other fel-
lows opinion to rest in peace then all time
could be devoted to constructive criticism of
the magazine

  i like stories of chemistry cant we please have
more ofthem

  why is wrny at the top of each cover does
amazing stories really have a broadcasting sta-
tion 

  in the august number is the story of the man
that could vanish true

  i believe that amazing stories will help a
great deal to make people give more attention to
science and to let scientists have more of a chance

  cant the magazine have a more substantial
foundation by the time mine gets read the
second time its all to pieces and then  have to
get out the glue etc before i can put it into my
library	marguerite keeley

los angeles cal

  wrny is owned by the company publishing
amazing stories so we really have a broadcasting
station of our own incidentally it represents the
highest type of radio work and its programs arc
selected with the greatest care and consideration
to please the unseen audience the man that
could vanish in the august number is not a
true story but it is a great tribute to the author
that it could be thought so

  we have not been favored by many letters from
readers of the fair sex we would like to hear
from more of them we thank our correspondent
for her very nice letter-editor

differences of time-travelling
into the future
editor amazing stories

  allow me to add my brief paean of praise for the
uniformly high character of your magazine to
those who devoured the books of jules verne
and h g wells your neriodical is indeed a
boon allow me also to add my comment on the
stories of ii g wells which you have printed

i	am impelled to do so because of the almost
flippant manner in which so many of your cor-
resnondents seem to dispose of his stories as dull
ana inferior

  of course the stories of edgar rice burroughs
are full of incident but the incidents portrayed
are mostly of the blood and thunder sort some
minds may prefer stories in which the hero kills
brontosauri with his naked hands in which go-
rillas are hatched out of eggs and gradually turn
into human beings of a high order in which on
every page the hero saves the heroine and slays
a score of animals or men but what scicnti-
fiction is there in a plenitude of gory incidents
if stories like those are real then so arc perils
of pauline and nick carter it is just in
the atmosphere created by such masters as wells
verne and conan doyle that their greatness lies
they can make a highly imaginative story such
as an attack by martians read tike the story of an
eye witness to the actual occurrence

  your correspondent riordan in the october issue
of your magazine is an instance in point he
asks why no airplanes were sent out against the
martians i think in all fairness to wells you
should inform your readers that the war of
the worlds was written about thirty years ago

amazing stories

fire brigadeii

before there were such things as airplanes a
for the marksmanship of the british artillery mi
kiordan has an exaggerated opinion as to wh
americans could do in like circumstances th
tanks in the last war were far slower object
than tin- martian machines and yet the recor
of dircct hits was quite low even at a thousant
yards you must get the range first before yot
cjn hope to hit your target these martians ac
cprding to wells retaliated with their heat raj
before the range could be found their ray and
their poison gas combined with their mobility
undoubtedly made them irresistible cortez ir
mexico and pizarro in peru never had such an
overwhelming superiority in arms as these mar-
tians possessed in the story and yet they conquered
empires with actual handfuls of men as fot
the description of the flight from london it is the
best thing in the book the disorganization of
humanity its frantic fear its pell-mell rush from
the new terror are all told so vividly that you
forget you are reading fiction it helps to make
the story seem real how many writers can do
that

  there is one kind of story that depends on an
utter fallacy and that is the fourtn dimension
story in which time becomes tjie fourth dimen-
sion  think that wells knew it when he wrote
the time machipe that is why he disposes
of the reasoning which would seem to argue for
the possibility of moving in the future in a page
or two and then proceeds to tell you an engrossing
tale as to what might happen to humanity and the
world in the incalculably remote future a hyatt
vcrrill however has made the mistake of making
the reasoning the story with the result that his
tale is a farrago of mathematical nonsense

  mentiroso discovers that the reckoning of
hours is different all over the world and from
that argues ingeniously in much the fashion that
the ancient pythagoreans argued if you can
fly fast enough you will leave calcutta on tues-
day and arrive in peru on monday as a matter
of fact it is true that radio messages are sent on
tuesday and received on the previous monday
send a message from london at one in the morn-
ing of tuesday and it will arrive in new york
the previous monday evening but the fallacy lies
in the purely arbitrary division of the week and
the day mankind performs most of its miracles
by symbols the year is determined by the
earths orbit the day is determined by the earths
rotation about its axis the month the week the
hour the minute and the second are purely ar-
bitrary divisions if time is different in two
places it is because the difference was artificially
created by mankind suppose mankind had said
that instead of counting the hours according to
sunrise and sunset the hours all over the world
should be the same instead of the sun rising in
new york at five oclock it would rise at ten
instead of going to work at nine we would go to
work at two we should easily grow accustomed
to counting the hours differently because we have
already done it with one hour our daylight saving
time in summer if the hours should be reck-
oned the same the world over what then becomes
of mr verrills argument about jumping back in
time as a matter of fact such a reckoning
would probably be more sensible than the present
confused method we dont shift our months about
to suit the weather why shift the hours about to
suit the light if mr vcrrill should take a trip
to the argentine he would find the trees blossom-
ing instead of losing their leaves the flowers would
be budding the insects humming summer would
be about to begin whereas with us it is ending
would he then say that he has travelled six
months into the future or six months into the
past if he would i should tell him to be his
age january isnt july in the argentine because
their january weather corresponds to our july
weather the time is the same the weather is
different it is the same with daylight the pres-
ent time is the same here and in calcutta the
light is different no matter what your speed in
travelling time would be consumed and you
would arrive in new york from calcutta later
and not earlier the same time is called by dif-
ferent numbers in the two places that is all

  another instance according to jewish chro-
nology this is the year  should mr vcrrill
step into a synagogue would he be  years
older because our reckoning says  absurd
isnt it why because both chronologies arc
artificial and made for convenience of reckoning
it is just as absurd to say that a radio message
leaving england monday evening and arriving in
new york at noon monday takes five hours less
than nothing in time to get to its destination
both times are artificially named for purposes of
convenience so if mr verrill should step from
russia where it would be november st into
poland where it would be november th the
same day would he step into the future two weeks
because russia follows the julian calendar and
poland the gregorian the time is exactly the
same the labels are different in the two countries

  all this talk of moving in the past and the fu-
ture is fallacious the theory seems to be that
just as we see the light of stars hundreds and per-
haps thousands of years after those rays were sent
out we can catch the past by the light that past
happenings made this docs not take into ac-
count that with the passing of time and traversing
of distance all waves lose their strength and are

transmuted into other forms of energy take
sound waves these lose their strength and are
dissipated so swiftly that the human car can tell
the difference the same is true of heat waves
and even light waves anyone owning a radio set
will tell you the same of radio waves if that
werent true any transmitting set could make itself
heard anywhere and everywhere so the sounds
of all the past have long since been dissipated and
so have the light waves that this earth may have
sent out as tar as the world is concerned so
that anyone trying to catch the past out of the air
as if unwinding a movie film will find that the
light waves have served to warm the air the
earth the water have aided in the creation of
electrical radio and countless other activities but
are wholly unavailable for review certainly you
couldnt hear any sounds made in the past sound
waves dissipate too easily

  as for moving in the future not even wells
can make out a plausible case for it to get an
impression of something that something must have
existence if nothing exists how can its image be
taken the future is too much fraught with doubt
all nature is accidental tomorrow we may enter
a poison belt such as arthur conati doyle describes
or we may be torn from the sun by another star
or we may explode suddenly or another glacial
period may come stronger than the last to wipe
out all life iiow can accidents be caught before
they happen

  of course one should not cavil at works of fiction
because they are fiction at the same time the
author of a work of fiction would do well not to
reason too much about impossibilities by doing
so he spoils the entire effect when like mr
verrill the author confines himself to the reasoning
only the result is arrant nonsense

  the term arrant nonsense could be applied
to many of the worlds classics your remarks on
time are most interesting do you not see that the
very story you criticize has set you to thinking and
there is suggested by you a most interesting idea
as you very justly remark the acceptance of day-
light saving proves your idea to be sound

  all that you write is interesting but there
is an error in the story which escaped author
editors and proofreaders and seems to have escaped
your notice also on page  of the november
issue the author reverses the rotation of the

 inkograph answers the purpose of both pen and pencil cotn-
 lined its point is shaped like a fine lead pencil point and
 v rites v ith ink free and easy without a miss skip or blurj-
 the steady uniform flow of ink actually improves
 handwriting iwont blot scratch leak or soil hands

   you who already possess a standard fountain pen
 will find the inkograph a most valuable addition to
 your writing equipment for it will do everything
 any fountain pen can do and many very important
 things which it is impossible to accomplish with
 any fountain pen at any price

combines the best features

  of both pen and pencil xninu the weak pointy bfi

 ence between inkograp  and

 c r fuller patterson mo

    i received my tnkograph with

  dozen ink pencils yours seems
  to be the only one that givee
  perfect satisfaction i believe
  you have solved the problem
  of the perfect writing instru-
  ment dr richard t
  mclaury dunkirk ind

    the inkograph is truly the
  best ien i ever had the pleasure
  to use barring no price or make
  of pen after i take into con-
  sideration the high price i
  usually paid fop a parker or a
  waterman pen i cannot see
  how such a low priced pen as
  the inkograph can be put on the
  market and rive such unusual
  service harvey l winston
  brentwood calif

   in making out local requisi-
  tions it is necessary to make an
  original and two carbon copies
  on very heavy paper and the
  inkograph does this twice aa
  well  as the hardest indelible
  pencil and is much neater and
  the original is much more
  legible wrn l fortney

  represent it to be and i was very

  writing this to ask that you send
  me another inkograph by re-
  turn mail charges cod e

  very highly to anyone who needs

  return of my inkograpn pen
  which you repaired for me i
  feel rather lost without this

  pen in ray pocket i prefer it to
  anv pen i ever carried principal-
  ly because of the ease with which
  one can write with it not having
  to be careful whether you slide
