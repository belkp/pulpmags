   l arnold grigg
her name wai sue and she wai an -yer-old
cornfed honey with plenty of trick up her
kimona ileete-when the had a kimona on
she was built like the hind quarters of
an elephant this gal sal tinker and
probably she was just as tough but
when i ran cross her one day in a clip
joint down on main street she was whin-
ing like a calf that had been forced on to
a skim milk diet before its time
  sal laid claim to being responsible for
the word prostitute being part of the
dictionary and i dont doubt but what she
was right she looked old enough to have
been one of cleopatras chamber maids
but she couldnt raise a nickel on her
own rusty charms
  even if sal was more or less out of
date and wind broken she was still a
winning horse for she had under her con-
trol four or five young hens that were
still in the peeping stage and quite
eligible enough for any monkey shine
from turning a hand spring to turning a
sucker inside out and wringing him dry
one of these blandishing females was
the cause of my extemporaneous visit to

sweet sue
sals place of business that eventful day
on orders from the district attorney
  it seems old j p something or other
had stepped out of bounds a trifle he
was lean lank and handsome as sals
girls would have said but he was unlucky
enough to have been burdened down with
a wife
  but old j p was in his second child-
hood or close to that stage for he was be-
ginning to feel his oats once more at a
time when he should have been making
sure his insurance policies were all in
good shape
  a few shots of sals furniture polish
started those oats to sprouting faster than
bees from a punctured nest and that was
sals cue to sic one of her trained pussies
on to the dizzy gent
  she played her shots well for she pick-
ed an eighteen year old corn fed honey
to carry on the good work with instruc-
tions to trim this christmas tree right
but the corn fed had a few tricks up her
own kimona that hadnt been born yet in
sals hey-day and she picked j p as a
likely looking customer to try them on
 her name was sue and she earned
every letter in it for she began by lead-
ing the docile j p upstairs over the
drinking room to a two by four bedroom
she called her own
  but j p was groggy sue let her ki-
mona flap open enticingly her volup-
tuous breasts bobbed around in front of
his nose and a trifle farther down her
shining body there was a navel display
that only his vest buttons were review-
ing beyond that a pair of dainty silk
panties half covered the remainder of the
charms that were now working the old
bozo into a fever sweat
  j p had never seen anything so beauti-
ful at least he admitted as much to the
crafty susan but the little corn fed
must have soaked her tongue in lau-
danum before she went to work on the
old bird for he passed into the arms of
morpheous before his excess boiler pres-
sure had a chance to blow off
  at least that was what he told the d
a sort of confidentially the next day
when he came to his senses and went
down to headquarters he thrashed
things out with the d a behind closed
doors and when he left an hour later he
was a wiser man both financially and
morally
  a short time later i got the dope also
behind closed doors it was in the shape
of leather wallet crammed full of money
but it wasnt worth the paper it was
printed on yes it was queer money
several thousand dollars of it
  sal was slated for a housecleaning at
that minute the d a was plenty sore
because j p was the corner stone of his
office something had to be done and
damn quick so armed with the wallet
and instructions to make sal replace
every dollar of that dough with honest
to god currency of the realm i sauntered
down main street keyed to the point
where i was ready to run the old war
horse and her three ringed circus out into
the sticks if necessary
  but sals joy parlor looked more like
a corner in the public library when i
arrived business was at a standstill and
the numerous tables scattered round the
room were sans any customers except
the chesty sal herself she was reading
a copy of a book that i hadnt thought up
til now she had ever even heard of yep
it was a bible and huge blops of water
were balancing themselves precariously
on her flabby cheeks perhaps hesitating
to inspect the abyss below that lay be-
tween her breasts now resting on the
table
  dumfounded i stood there scratching
my head while i wondered if the old gal
was really reforming or had picked up

sweet sue
          continued from page i
the book by mistake then remembering
that i was on business i tossed the wallet
on the table in front of her and said
you sucked the wrong lemon last
night sal theres five thousand dollars
of fancy engraved paper in that wallet
and the d a wants you to redeem it
pronto or else youre quits here under-
stand
  but good old sal never even sighed
she turnej over another page in the bible
and fished out a lace bordered handker-
chief from some where down around for-
bidden territory and dabbed it gently
to her eyes
  what is this any how are you try-
ing to make a monkey out of me i shot
at her as i began to get riled up i said
i want you to redeem this money
  i heard you the first time she drawl-
ed out unconcernedly and she dropped
the book on the table id like to have
some one redeem a nice new one grand
bill myself sweetheart she smiled
  tell it to the marines sal i said
theyre interested in foreign tales
wheres all your female performers are
you giving them a vacation on last nights
proceeds
  yes she sneered they earned it
when an eighteen year old hick can come
in here an take sal tinker over the
hurdles like this dame sue did well its
time for me to retire or something
what dyou mean i inquired still
unable to penetrate her wandering re-
marks
  why shes the one thats passing this
queer money thats what i mean last
night she swapped bank rolls with old
j p just so he wouldnt notice it if he
did regain his senses before she had a
chance to get away then the little sor-
ceress had the crust to tell me that he
slipped her a grand note for her enter-
tainment abilities
 well maybe he did sal i said
knowing that when a mans charged al-
coholically he is liable to do funny things
  not on your tin-type she snarled
back at me she had a grand note all
right but she didnt get it from him
there it is and she tossed it on to the
table in front of me i was fool enough
to change it into small bills for her damn
near cleaned me out of ready cash too
at that
  so the up and coming generation is
getting too smart for you eh sal i said
but whats a little cash to you youll
make that up in no time how about this
bunch of paper i have here what do
you intend to do about it
  not a damn thing she said and she
picked up the book again you can tell
j p for me that hed better keep a
tight hold on to his shirt or that little
sorceress will make it run up and down
his back like a window shade
  say what is this sorceress business
anyhow i asked when did you get
so damned educated
  last night sweetheart so did j p
for sweet little sue showed me a nice
pair of silk panties that have the swellest
set of finger prints on them you ever saw
nice heavy black ink ones too did he
mention anything about his soiled fingers
this morning sue said she was keeping
the panties for a souvenir you know
just in case j p should get up on his
high horse occasionally now isnt that
sorcery for you
  well ill be damned i emitted sur-
prised but you didnt find that word
in the bible i hope
  yes its in here old dear but i just
found it out i guess im getting too old
to buck this game any more so im
thinking of becoming an evangelist or
something dont slam the door when
you go out

  well i took the wallet back to the d
as office and sals thousand buck note
also j ps mouth shut up like a clam
when he heard the news yes the little
corn fed morsel came back to town but
she received as much protection as the
crown jewels would have got at a four
hundred ball
  sue is still her name even though she
has a swell three room apartment and
sports sables sue is her occupation also
which old j p could testify to if he had
a mind to talk the pink panties have
well earned their keep and sue has had
them photographed just to remind j p
occasionally that theyre still useful even
if they are out of date
  sal oh yes i saw her the other day
punching a tambourine down on main
street while she warbled some song that
had to do with saving sinners cock eyed

the sporting chance by harold ward
illustration by bob gon jr
iram akley and martha sneed
had been keeping company for
several months when jabez sneeds
attempt to corner the agricultural imple-
ment market of sac city terminated with
disastrous results when the wreckage
was cleared away jabez found himself
the owner of a house decorated with
mortgages a ledger filled with bad
accounts and a pique against the world
in general whereupon he splattered his
brains against one side of a newly
papered bedroom with an old colts re-
volver and his creditors started fighting
over his assets before the undertaker had
finished his melancholy rites he be-
queathed to martha his love a thousand
dollar insurance policy and a strain of
sporting blood inherited from some long-
torgotten progenitor
  in spite of the fact that hiram was the
village cut-up martha loved him with
old-fashioned devotion she would have
married him in a minute had he said the

the sporting chance
word but alas for her peace of mind
he never said it hiram it was hinted
went to a leg-er-burlesque show every
time he made his annual visit to new
york to buy shoes for the emporium of
which he was proprietor likewise he
oiled his hair waxed his mustache played
penny-ante and chewed peppermint lozen-
ges which in sac city is prima facie evi-
dence that a man drinks whisky or eats
onions this accumulated mass of bucolic
devilishness made hiram the object of
many a whispered conversation at sewing
society meetings and incidentally a man
to be shunned by all sac city maidens
who hoped to preserve their unsullied
reputations hence marthas association
with hiram ostracized her in sac city and
she found herself upon the death of her
father alone in the world and seemingly
doomed to a life of spinsterhood in a
town where scandal-mongers make moun-
tains out of mole hills over night
  martha realized this so did hiram
in fact he rather enjoyed his bad reputa-
tion but martha being a wise damsel
knew deep down in her heart that hiram
was not never had been and never would
be a real honest-to-gawd sport and she
felt if she once got the matrimonial hook
in his gills that she could straighten him
up with a jerk the trouble was to hook
him for hiram was wise beyond his
years and having broken her heart as he
supposed turned his gaze towards a
fluffy-haired blond from a nearby town
  if martha had shriveled up and died of
a dislocated heart hirams cup of happi-
ness would have been filled to overflow-
ing his reputation as a real gol darnit
would have been made and all the girls
in sac city would have worked overtime
flirting with him but martha was not
an ordinary girl she declined to shrivel
besides she was a regular reader of zippy
stories and knew all the ropes so while
the town gossips were busily engaged in
raking skeletons out of the fluffy-haired
blonds closet she cashed her insurance
policy pocketed the money and slipped
away
 a month after her disappearance
hiram received a letter from her telling
him that she was in new york working
twenty-four hours a day as a model for
rolf armstrong norman rockwell and
other artistic lights hiram sat up and
took notice he had never thought mar-
tha especially beautiful but he realized
that possibly familiarity bred contempt
he dug her photograph done by sac
citys best photographer out of his bu-
reau drawer and inspected it carefully
yes he decided she was pretty strange
that he had never noticed it before all
of the sporting blood within him surged
to the surface hiram too read zippy
stories and he knew that models are the
alpha and omega of naughtiness he ex-
pected to make his annual pilgrimage to
the city within a few weeks and he felt
that his acquaintance with martha would
allow him to open the muffler and hit the
high places in a way to astonish the
natives she might even visit a cabaret
with him and all the blase new yorkers
would point him out and ask each other
who the handsome man was over there
in the corner with the pretty little model
  marthas next play brought hiram up
standing she sent him a photograph
decolette bearing saronys imprint
merely one of the number of little
studies for magazine covers she wrote
for your own personal inspection only
for people back home are so funny you
know she also suggested that as it
was nearly time for his annual trip to the
city he pay her a visit while in new
york then followed several pages of
gossip in which she told of prominent
authors illustrators and actors she met
by harold ward

daily of studio life and bohemianism in
general oh martha had hiram going
all right she knew that he would do just
what he did do-seize the bit in his teeth
date his trip ahead two weeks and send
her a wire that he was starting next day
  hiram was so excited upon his arrival
that he indulged in the unaccustomed
luxury of a taxi and hastened to marthas
address it was-or seemed to hiram-
palace an attendant in gorgeous raiment
piloted him to an upper floor in a gilded
cage a dainty maid with a white cap and
a french accent ushered him into mar-
thas presence she was entertaining that
evening it seemed for the apartment
half drawing room half studio was filled
with people in evening dress on a
spacious balcony just outside as hiram
could see by looking through a pair of
half-opened florentine doors distinguish-
ed looking men chatted with equally dis-
tinguished looking women upon his
entrance martha gave a happy excited
little squeak and rushed towards him
arms outstretched then greetings over
she ushered him about the spacious room
introducing him to various celebrities of
whom he had read-authors artists
poets musicians hiram was dazed he
gazed about the room taking in the gold
spanish leather hangings the rich cur-
tains the sarouk rugs the rich prints on
the walls the sheraton chairs after
which he did some rapid mental arith-
metic almost immediately the maid
served refreshments from a tray and what
hiram took for an excellent grade of
hard cider from a bottle as the bubbles
mounted to his head he recovered rapidly
from his bashfulness and in less than no
time was cutting capers with jake lubert
and irvin snobb he even called david
selasco by his first name and danced a
set with lyndia pinkham while hank
wilstach played the piano in fact he
was feeling his oats as they say in sac
city when the party broke up and the
guests took their departure at marthas
request he remained until they had gone
  now she demanded as she snuggled
down beside him on the settee tell me
all about yourself and the folks back
home
  hirams answer was an attempt to fold
her in his arms but she gently repulsed
his advances
  he was surprised why i thought
he blurted out that all models-
were immoral martha interrupted
well im not
  hiram did some more rapid calculat-
ing he appraised the furnishings mar-
thas gown everything she had never
looked so radiant to him before he
realized all of a sudden that he wanted
her it may have been the bubbles go-
ing to his head but that has nothing to
do with this story he turned upon her
suddenly
  then how the dickens he exclaimed
did you pay for all these things these
here rooms must rent for near a hundred
dollars a month
  a hundred a week she returned laz-
ily
  and youve got a hired girl-
  i only pay felice thirty dollars a
week hiram
  thirty dollars a week for a hired girl
that cant hardly speak english he
shouted his eyes blazed martha are
you making this money honestly
what do you mean she returned

only great people can make great
mistakes i would have laughed
five years ago-i would not have
believed the great white doctor could be
so very wrong that he could cure misery
but when his error brought a blessing to
the hated tabu that is pala osheil even
the brown sorcerers of our island raised
an eyebrow of scorn
  i was going through the grove of ban-
yan trees to the pool under the little
water fall when i first saw althea my
head heavy with sadness was bowed
or i would have seen her long before i
stepped on her few clothes all silk and
shining lying near the edge of the water
her face was turned from me as she stood
where the cool water falling from the
rocks splashed down on the round shells
that were her breasts her skin was so
white i stepped behind a miki bush and
breathed heavily like a man running
white i looked at my own body that was
like the shadows between night and day
half-white the curse of the gods of rua
maluri my mother-as for the god of
my irish father he too would have none
of me nor i of him
  i do not know how long i watched al-
thea as she dived and jumped about and
swam there not as strong in her motions
as our brown girls but quieter softer

white lie
her shoulders drooped like the branches
of the tao and were not straight and
high like those of our island women
when she stood on a rock to dive her
hips were slender like a young cocoa
palm-but so white no color but her
hair-rust gold like the sun when it dips
down in the sea
  the sweet smell of some strange scent
was blowing through my head did these
women from far away rub themselves
with fragrant oils as did our girls could
any perfume of her carry to me there
then i knew it was from her thin silk
things that lay near my feet i crept to
them on my stomach so she would not see
me-for being white she has learned to
hide always the beauty of her body they
were green these clothes green as the
baby leaves of the hotu but when i raised
the heap of them to my nose the scent
made my heart beat in my chest like the
beating of bells in father benadottes
mission my brain was dancing as when
i drink much kava i buried my face in
their soft smoothness
  the blood of rua maluri races through
my flesh had i stayed another moment
the white men would have killed me for
i was crazed enough for any folly but
i ran ran as though ten devils were at
my back nor did i stop until i had climb-
ed high up into the mountain of harnoa
where my hut is hidden like the nest of
the little green dove where i can look
down at last on the tiny valley and on
the brown and white men who look down
on me when i am with them
  i could not rest all night that sweet
smell was blowing in my head as i rolled
on my mat next day i was down at the
pool at the same time waiting for her-
but she did not come on the day after i
awoke trembling and told myself i would
not go yet i was there waiting early in
the morning at last she came slowly to
the edge of the stream let her clothes slip
off and fall at her feet then stepped over
them to slip into the cooling waters
when she saw me running to her she
swam with much splashing to the other
side of the pool    but the race was
short as she reached the rocks on the
other side i caught her tiny foot and pull-
ed her back putting my arm around her
waist i swam back with her to the bank
she tried to beat my face with her hands
that only made me laugh wildly she was
so short of breath and choked with water
she scarce could scream
  up the hills i scrambled with her
sparkling body over my shoulder jump-
ing from rock to rock she was so light
and tiny when finally we reached my
bamboo hut i set her down on a mat of
scarlet cocoanut fibre she sat up with
tears running down the sides of her nose
  they will kill you for this she said
looking at me for the first time
  you are right i answered but it
does not matter
  then i got some figured tapa cloth tore
off a large piece and gave it to her to
make a pareu eagerly she seized it and
tied it in folds about her waist   
  most of the day she sat there in silence
only looking at me when i turned my eyes
away from her i put foods before her-
taro cocoanut meat and a shell of poi
poi-but she would touch none of it she
seemed to be lost in her thoughts plan-
ning perhaps to get back to the valley i
asked her questions who she was why
she was on our island her name she only
shook her head and stared around the
little hut with her wide eyes green-gray
as the mists of early morning i was sorry
for her yet no power could have swayed
me to take her back

continued from page 
  you like music i asked as the eve-
ning was coming without answer i got
my guitar that my father had left me and
sang for her all the native songs i knew
she seemed to rest easier then perhaps
she was no longer afraid i would roast
her perhaps she could hear in my songs
how i was lonesome lonesome-always
so alone
  as darkness wrapped us she watched
my every move her eyes followed me
while i lit some strings of candle-nuts
hanging from the cross poles at last she
spoke
play some more please she said
  her voice went into me like a knife
yet it was soft and pleasing something
like a bird sound only so very sad like
a sadness that had been over her a long
time i sat with my legs under me and
picked from the strings all the songs i
knew a few bits of the white mans
songs too she was thinking while she
listened i could feel the poor little
thoughts flowing through her mind we
people of the island of motu nova have
always taken our women but the irish in
me was tearing at my heart one by one
the candle-nuts dropped their black ashes
on the mats and fluttered out as the last
one threw shadows across our faces she
drooped like a weary puppy and lay down
there was all darkness and i could hear
nothing but her breath like a wind sigh-
ing among the palms out under the stars
i walked through the night asking
questions of the strange god of my father
  in the morning she spoke to me what
shall i call you she said
  my name is pala osheil i replied
she opened her eyes in surprise
  you see my father was irish i add-
ed only my mother was of here
  they call me althea was all she said
but she ate heartily when i brought foods
and roasted a little fish for her she began
to talk as she ate and seemed no longer
afraid i knew she was thinking of how to
get away and her friendliness was to fool
me sometimes i even caught her smile
and although i knew she was pretending
yet it made me very glad after breakfast
i went off in the thickets as though i were
leaving but quickly came back and hid
behind a pandanus tree to watch her al-
thea sat quietly for a long time when at
last she went into the hut she came out
with a piece of printed cloth thrown over
her pearly shoulders and looked around
slowly she had put on a pair of my san-
dals but as they were much too large for
her delicately shaped feet she had tied
them on with some yellow reeds i follow-
ed quietly as she darted down the moun-
tain path around the rocks after letting
her get along a little way i appeared sud-
denly before her
  oh i was just looking for some
water she said as she stopped
  i-i wanted to wash
  very well i answered i will take
you to a stream nearby it is not very dif-
ferent from that other one and i should
like to bathe too
  with a laugh i picked her up and car-
ried her to where the mountain was split
apart and where white waters splashed
and swirled and dropped downward on
their way to the valley there were many
large stones in the stream rounded
smoothly by the rushing water i showed
althea how to slide down in the current
over and around them soon she was
laughing too then we would creep out
to the bank and walk up the hill together
to come whirling down again she behind
me her tiny toes poking into my back
when at last she would fall in a heap on
by lester weil

top of me as we slid over a bit of a falls
into a pool below it
  wearied after a while we stretched laz-
ily on the bank and looked up into the
drooping leaves of a breadfruit tree
 and why do the natives hate you
althea asked
  because my mother was tabu i an-
swered she was not allowed to have a
child she was a taupo in the village a
kind of sacred person you know whom
no man may marry or even look upon
with eyes of desire they hate me too
because i will not tatoo my face and body
as they do i could feel blood warming
my face as althea looked over the whole
large length of me
  you were right she said and then
added you will take me back wont
you
  i looked at her something in her face
made me want terribly to touch it
  althea i started stumbling on my
words i have never been happy before
it seemed i was drowning in those gray-
green eyes the wind blew a wisp of
bronze hair across her mouth
  poor lonely pala she whispered and
she smiled and put her little hand slowly
over mine as though half afraid still
  tomorrow i will take you to the val-
ley i told her it hurt me to say it i
would rather have let the shark sink his
teeth over my whole right arm but i
could not bear to make althea sad as i
was then she crept to me and put her
warm wet lips on my cheek and warm
drops of water splashed down on my
face from hers as i held her my throat
choked my breath i could say no words
  that night was cruelly bitter sweet
i can still see her as she sat under the
tiny torches eyes shining with the
thought of going back to her people in
the morning her face pink and smiling
when i could forget the day to come i
was filled with a burning joy i played
and althea sang with me her voice was
clear and tender and i told her long tales
of the islands of the battles and glories
of my mothers people great fighters all
of them
  what is it pala she asked once
when i had slipped into my sad thoughts
again
  i wish i could die tomorrow i an-
swered life is heavy on me-it is not
good
  she looked at the mats and was still
when she spoke i could not believe her
  i wish i were dead too pala she
said some things are worse if you only
knew-
  but you have all things i cried to
her all the great gifts of my fathers
people you are white white people
could not be unhappy althea laughed
quietly in a strange way
  come pala at least we have tonight
for singing
  and she began to sing fast little songs
from across the seas with funny quick
words soon i was trying to remember
these songs-and forget that i was pala
  they came for us just after dawn the
whites stayed outside and let the natives
crawl up to the hut-no trouble in get-
ting plenty who hated me enough-and
they stank of the rum the whites had
poured into them for i carry my moth-
ers tabu they would never harm me un-
less bribed and driven i who am kept
apart for the revenge only of the gods
altheas people took her while the
screaming islanders bound me with ropes
of bamboo fibres then down the moun-
tain-with me trussed up on crossbars
and held aloft to be chanted at madly all
the way to keep my evil spirit from strik-

white lie
ing them down althea did not come near
me
  back in the village i was slung up
from the beams of the ti the long hut
of sacred rites and weapons where feet
of women have never entered all day
the drums beat rum and kava flowed
all day the dancing grew wilder while
the white men winked and let the for-
bidden rites go on all day they laughed
hideously in my ears while i stared sul-
lenly at spears and knives thrust at my
face with all their screeching at last
came darkness and the great fires
  i was not afraid to die if only they
would have shot me decently but there
is an old law among our people that to
prevent a tabu from having revenge after
death you must eat his brain yet i could
not believe the whites would allow the
old slow ritual of roasting to go on the
drums beating and beating in my ears
was maddening   
  as the moon came up outside the ti
where i was hanging every one of the
warriors was out there dancing fiercely
around the fire i knew they would come
for me soon now-i was in a kind of
stupor but all i wished for was to have
it over as quickly as possible i heard a
noise from the back of the hut as though
a dog were trying to squeeze in through
the upright stalks of the wall looking
down i saw a shoulder push through
  althea i cried in a hoarse whisper
as her face all pale and frightened came
through the opening you must not
come here
  she ran to me climbed on one of the
bamboo logs that was used as a headrest
and slashed at my bindings with a sharp
knife
  be still pala she whispered and
listen quickly
  but this place is tabu althea they
will kill you too if they catch you
  the devil with their sacred tabus
she went on as she kept cutting at my
ropes in a few moments she had sawed
through all of them and i was on the
ground stiff and reeling
  listen quickly pala she went on a
canoe is waiting for you at the second
little bay past the government store it is
filled with everything you will need
she pushed a paper bag in my hand it
was heavy
  if they get close to you pull the iron
pegs out of these and throw them no
one will be able to follow you for they
will be blinded by the gas but keep far
from the fumes yourself
  before i could answer she pulled my
head down kissed my lips quickly and
was off wriggling her small body through
the opening in the back of the hut
  i looked at the balls of tin in the bag
they were strange to me but i had heard
of this new weapon of the white man
they had been used on coulao against
the natives during a revolt of the copra
workers as i crawled quietly to the door-
way i repeated altheas words pull out
the iron peg throw them and run ah
yes-but it would take more than this
miracle to get through those howling
devils
  creeping on my stomach i squirmed
my way to the outer circle of their fires
their senses are unbelievably sharp only
their drunkeness could keep me from be-
ing seen or heard by at least one of them
yet i believe i would have gotten past
had they not gone in to bring me out to
the flames then followed a terrific yell-
ing while they scattered about looking
and listening as a few of them got close
enough to reach i pulled the pin from one

although who they are youll

white lie
          continued from page 
of the tin balls and threw it into the
group with all my strength the effect
was magical i felt like shouting my
body was strong again i did not stop
long to watch them scream and writhe
with pain as they were choked and blind-
ed but ran on as fast as i could through
the tangled vines and umbrella ferns but
i was not yet clear of them somehow a
new group got through the gas they now
knew which way i was running and they
began to gain on me rapidly for i was
not yet entirely well from the binding
ropes nor had i food or water since the
night before when they were almost up-
on me i feared i too would be blinded if
i threw another ball yet i pulled the
peg and let them have it closing my eyes
and holding my breath as i struggled to
get away from the gas i stumbled and
fell on my face expecting to feel them
pounce on me but their screams told
me i was now safe so i crawled out of
danger of the fumes and hurried as fast
as possible to the bay
  the outrigger canoe was drawn up on
the beach in the little cove and althea
had put plenty of food and water in it
pushing off and jumping in i paddled out
past the surf breakers deciding mean-
while to head up the shore toward the
tiny island of takarao which is rich in
breadfruit trees as well as mango limes
and taro after tonight i felt sure my
people would never trouble me again  the
gas must have seemed a just punishment
to them for breaking the tabu that pro-
tected me my thoughts were interrupted
by the sight of another canoe which sud-
denly put out from a small bay just ahead
of me someone was trying to head me
off i still had two gas balls left so i
snatched one and set myself to land it in
the other canoe when it came close
enough my hand was drawn back  i
heard a voice shout pala
  althea i cried my voiced filled with
wild happiness
  i thought she had paddled out to say
goodbye instead she made me help her
into my boat fasten the other at the stern
while she sat in the bow and helped me
paddle
  do not talk with me about it now
she threw over her shoulder tomorrow
you will take me-where i will tell you
but now get away quickly
  i did not understand but together we
pushed on resting when we needed till
the dawn found us at takarao
  althea was strangely quiet she kept
her eyes away from me and stared down
the hill through the trees down there in
the still water of the lagoon where our
canoes were drawn up on the sand we
had finished our breakfast of fruits and
cocoanut milk
  are you too weary to take me there-
before the sun goes down  she asked
  i am very tired where althea
she was silent then she seemed to be
talking to herself
  oh it is worse than death-if only
i could die now but the great doctor said
it would come slowly
  what is it althea-what cloud is over
you i took her hand she pulled it away
from me trembling
  when you are rested pala she whis-
pered you will take me to    pokinaru
the leper colony i gasped i can see
her now shaking her head in terror green
eyes wide against the paleness of her skin
her lips moved repeating my words
scarcely can i recall what i did or said
   she must have thought me quite mad
  for the love of god have pity on me
pala   
  then i found myself on my knees
by lester weil

praying for the first time to the one i
had cursed and in my thankfulness
my eyes that had burned in dry scorn
before the tortures of my people were
wet with tears and i did not care
  cant you see dear althea i said
at last as i put my arms around her
our shadows have met and vanished-
we are in the sun now
  she seemed not to hear why do you
think i came to these islands she mum-
bled when they read my note at the
mission they will know too i could not
tell them i hoped and hoped it was not
so her voice was dull they will be
glad to have me out of the way yes-
tonight you must take me-there
  i swear i will kill myself if you go
i cried oh i love you so
 i too pala-that is why we go to
pokinaru tomorrow
  tomorrow has never come it is al-
ways today
  i will make you hideous your fine
strong body-ah no
  we have souls-one can live forever
in one sweet month-a year perhaps i
lifted her small form in my arms
  your lips burn me dear pala but it
is the kiss of death
  of life althea come we will pull
candle-nuts for our altar when i bring
pere benadotte here tomorrow he will
say ah my boy have i not always said
you would come to the faith of your
father and the good priest will laugh
perhaps pala she whispered as she
pressed her lips to my ear we too can
laugh then-a little while
  look i cried and i turned her to-
ward the sea a school of porpoises were
playing about on the top of the waters
close in to the shore which is ever an
omen of good fortune
  only great people can make great mis-
takes i would have laughed five years
ago - i would not have believed the
great white doctor could be so very
wrong that he could cure misery but
when his error brought a blessing to the
hated tabu that is pala osheil even the
brown sorcerers of our islands raised an
eyebrow of scorn
rupert since weve been on the pier ive noticed several girls smile at
you i suppose youre not assuming your single man swagger are you
re cl ct
she lay on a crimson rug all in silky
white her midnight eyes closed
her glorious hair unbound she was
dead
  seated close by were two men one
crumpled back in his chair moaned her
name ceaselessly - despairingly the
other leaning forward kept burning eyes
fixed upon the beautiful motionless form
  but a few hours past she had been the
essence of life-the allurement of puls-
ing womanhood madly merry-ravish-
ilustration by carl link
ingly lovely-tempting retreating be-
witchingly beseeching she had spun the
moment in the web of her charm
  how those slender arched feet had
danced over the bare studio floor how
her perfectly moulded body had kept in
the rhythm with the abandon of motion
but the exquisiteness of grace
  and the star-gleam in her eyes the
flowering smile upon her red parted lips
the constant fluttering movement of her
soft white hands
by freda summerfield

  and then faster and faster-still fas-
ter until the madness of it made ones
eyes ache and ones pulse beat to burst-
ing with the passion of it all
 now music she was playing for
them her treasured old violin cuddled
close against her panting breasts the
heart-beat of the world the destructive
mirth of the uncaring-oh how the wild
notes grew the jeers the curses the
poison of unlawful caresses
  the losing battle of the weak - the
helpless pain of the poor-the tears of
the unloved swelled with the volume of
her melody the piercing agony of re-
morse-the tortured cry of the trapped
-the shrill battle cry of revenge-and
finally the haunting desolation of a
damned soul
  their hearts squeezed with the ache
of it they had begged her to stop
  so abruptly she had broken into song
her violin still hugged to her rounded
bosom her eyes darkly dilated staring
into the sombre dusk
  clear true-strong and beautiful rose
her voice reaching out and out and out
-and dying away like the whisper of a
dead love
  silence held them the woman stood
in the same position her eyes strangely
heavy and a small smile tipped her
mouth a single word formed her lips
twice she made the effort and then into
the quiet of the room came her whis-
pered done
  he of the burning blue eyes sucked in
his breath and made as though to rise
but the other one laughed-not under-
standing
 give us some tea he drawled
stretching lazily you rather overdid
yourself marise i feel tearful
  she only moved her head the flaming
fire of her eyes startled him
  tea    my god sudden shrill
laughter broke from her but ere it had
found sound she crashed face downward
to the floor
  and they picked her up dead
 say something cried he who had
owned her body
 keep still muttered he who had
sold her soul
 oh why should she have wished to
die whimpered on the first if i only
knew if i only knew oh god it is
too cruel i loved her well that she
should leave me so oh god why did
she do it why why
  the smoldering blue eyes never left
the still face of the dead woman dam-
nation  be still
  i cant i wont was the wild an-
swer i must talk or go mad
  fool the other replied brutally
you snivel like a hurt brat will ques-
tions bring her back
  no-no i cant believe it it is one
of her pranks she is not dead she is
not she is not and with a shudder-
ing gasp he fell on his knees by the quiet
form and lavished wild caresses upon the
cold lips
  she is dead came with remorseless
distinctness from the other even as
she danced the poison was eating out her
heart
  my god stop shrilled the kneeling
man hiding his face in his hands
  in a moment he arose and went reel-
ing from the room and the sound of his
feet padded up the stairs then came the
dull thud of a door
  then the other moved for the first
time a sound that was like that of a
beast of the jungle in pain escaped his
writhing lips as he fell to the floor by the
side of the woman

  to the man upstairs the thought was
born that perhaps she had left a message
-a letter of farewell he stopped his
aimless pacing of the room and began to
search her desk with shaking hands
contents of drawers and pigeonholes
were gone through with frantic haste
and for the second and third times but
no slightest word was found
  with a burst of rage he swept all to
the floor sobbing and cursing at the
same time
  and then he saw conspicuously placcd
on a small side table propped against
her photograph an envelope addressed
to him in her characteristic scrawl
   his arm shot out and swept it up even
as his fingers ripped out the letter he
read
      you have just come from my dead
   body i who amused you am no more i
   will never again dance to the mad merry
   strains of the violin-nor sing in the pass-
   ionate fullness of the night  will never
   laugh nor weep my lips are cold and my
   eyes dull the body you bought is worth-
   less for the bruised sou of it has gone
      wherever i am out in the great eternity
     am watching you as you read this and
    i am glad ive long wanted to die-and
    today i am dead
     god how ive hated you and hated you
   and hated you how i laugh as i write
   this dead the truth from the dead how
   many times did you kiss me remember
   well for you took a full measure of hate
   and loathing with each
     you bought my body-you fool rut
   what of my soul it went down to hell
     and he who sold me    your friend
   your friend you say a secret with the
   dead fool he fleeced you you paid
   heavily for my body oh fool   
      take that sharp knife lying near-creep
    softly down the stairs-steal into the room
    where i was    there kneels the other and
    he holds the body you bought close in his
    arms    and upon my breast you will find
    the stain of his kiss
     will you go fool will you go i am
  dead and he kisses my breast
 an awful word escaped the mans
grey lips madness coursed poison-
swift through his veins the knife-the
stairs were gained without a bead of
sound-the room was entered before the
count of ten a startled curse broke from
the others lips as he stumbled to his
feet
  then he saw the knife
  fool he shouted keep away
 did-you-kiss-her came a mere
thread of a voice
  no-no i swear it i- he broke
off shuddering he saw death
  leaning down the man swept aside
the loose bodice a purple mark glowed
on the marble bosom
  liar and the knife shot out with
the hand of frenzied hate and found the
others heart
  he stood a bare fraction then terror
tightened each feature both hands beat
the air as he lurched sideways the
scream of realization strangled horribly
he spun once around before plunging
heavily to the floor   
  bells were ringing for the new year
shrill whistles and sound of revelry burst
upon the air
  did an inscrutable expression mould
the dead womans features was it satis-
faction had she meant it so-had she
planned it so was it her revenge a
love which gave all sold into shame out-
raged betrayed relentlessly pursued-
had she cunningly dug the pitfall for
destruction 
  one murdered-one blasted
  and the dead woman lying between-
still and beautiful - her long hair un-
bound her hands folded meekly across
her pulseless breast
 did she smile	 
illustration by c  longabaugh
paused my cup to my lips it
seemed impossible that this healthy
rosy cheeked man who smiled at me
across the little restaurant could be
henry livermore the physical wreck i
parted with some five years before but
it was and i found my hand caught in
a grip of iron as he dropped into a chair
opposite me loudly demanding news of
my wanderings
  but you i gasped as i took in his
appearance of abundant good health
why man you were dying when i last
saw you even the most sanguine spe-
cialists scarcely gave you a year and
now-
 and now i look younger than you
eh and feel younger too ill warrant
yes and ill look younger still he went
on banging the table i am slowly dye-
ing my gray hair black then ill be
forty instead of sixty look it and feel
it it will be the old wild life over again
with a hearty laugh on the devil and
his friends-the doctors he laughed
boyishly throwing back his head in sheer
enjoyment at my amazement
  you certainly are in the pink of con-
dition i admitted then the wonder
of the thing struck me
  tell me about it i questioned eag-
erly
  henry livermore leaned far back in
his chair blew large rings of smoke
towards the ceiling regarded them in
thought then tossing away the stub lit
another large black cigar which years
since had been forbidden after regard-
ing my bewilderment with keen satisfac-
tion he announced with some pride that
he had discovered the secret of life
  the doctors all gave me up he told
me i think there were ten of them-
all told my heart was bad my liver
well i doubt if more than two admitted
i possessed a liver but all agreed and
some offensively that my life had been
one mad debauch that i had played fast
and loose with death and was some ten
years over my time there was one par-
ticularly offensive old quack a nasty
weazened little fellow that i had crossed
in love in my younger days youve had
all the thrills in life he croaked now
by carroll john day

  youre going to die die horrible there
is one thrill left-if youve got the nerve
to take it and do you know charlie
my lad the little scoundrel had the bad
taste to open his window there was no
misunderstanding him his office was on
the fourteenth floor
  he shook his shoulders in horror at
the recollection then he laughed
 saw him this morning-upon honor
charlie it took ten years from his life
when he saw the playful way i prodded
him with my stick
  but how did you do this i brought
him back to the subject
  began to think like all big minds
mine is most active under great stress
what a terrible thing it would be for me
to lie down and die no no i couldnt
do it it wouldnt be the expected thing
i could name a dozen ladies who would
take to their bed at the thought of it i
must go out like a candle quick and
sudden with perhaps an air of mystery
about it jumping from a building-
well that had its good points to be sure
but my looks i believe i may say with-
out conceit that i am somewhat hand-
some he paused a moment stroked his
chin a bit then continued
  these thoughts of death you might
think were brought about by melancholia
quite the contrary they afforded me
much pleasure they thrilled me and so
great was the fascination that i reached
home without the aid of a stick
  by the time i reached my study i had
decided to take my life and had chosen
the way together with some little notes
i would leave behind me a dozen let-
ters to some dear ladies with my love and
devotion-that was all these letters i
sent my man out to mail unfortunately
several ladies fainted before breakfast the
following morning
  taking my revolver from my drawer
i entered my bedroom and sat before the
mirror of my dressing table the mirror
before me and the revolver held tightly
under my left ear i prepared to watch
my own death
  as i watched myself i experienced
surprise that the usual pallor of my face
had given away to a faint touch of color
my heart missed a beat-gave sudden
spasmodic jumps as i watched the ham-
mer rise to the tightening of my finger
ah but that was a moment every
muscle in my body vibrated a part of
my leg which had been lifeless for
months began to feel the rush of blood
imagine it charlie i was watching
quick and sudden death-and that death
was mine
  i pressed harder saw the hammer
rise then fall with a sharp click with
that click a tremor shook my entire body
i was a new man i had often played
with death-but this time i had chal-
lenged death and won
  later i discovered that two bullets
were missing from the revolver still i
had given death the odds three to two
and won i wont go so far as to say
that i was a well man at once but i was
a new one and within a year i was-as
you see me now
  he threw his arms wide apart and tip-
ping his chair far back against the wall
awaited my admiration
  within a year you were a well man
i	repeated slowly then the meaning of
his words struck me you dont mean
you cant mean-
  that i have played the same game
since he took the words out of my
mouth yes ive played it since-a
hundred times or more sometimes with
one bullet-then again with three and
once with four he barely whispered this
as he leaned across the table that was
a night charlie he continued his eyes
one more thrill

alight but i was like a boy after it you
see i needed a new thrill the old ones
had long lost their charms their powers
  you dont mean to say that you go
on with this
   do he tapped me on the shoulder
you are the only one who knows and of
course i trust my secret with my old and
tried friend
  of course i gulped but you are
well again there will be no need to con-
tinue with such- i halted and looked
for a word
  flirting with death is what i call it
he laughed yes and ill have to keep
at it till the devil holds the winning hand
if you look at the wlmle thing in a seri-
ous way charlie my lad youll see that
it couldnt cure my heat or my liver i
live on the excitement alone sometimes
when a bad spell come- on i sit in front
of the mirror for an hmr or more  put
in one bullet give the barrel a twist then
wait if the thrill dont come i put in
two later perhaps three it takes
nerve i tell you to press that trigger i
had three in this morning thats what
makes me feel so chipper he finished
with pride
    that was my first talk with henry
livermore but not my last he took
my remonstrances good-naturedly and
laughed at my many objections to the
forcible means he had adopted as a cure
  later he became irritable and in silent
tactful consent we avoided the subject
  his spirits would rise and fall during
the next few months so i seemed to know
almost to the hour when he faced the
gun opposite the mirror
  at last i formed a scheme to save my
friend and when i discovered that he was
flirting with death on the average of
once a week i decided to put my plan to
the test without further delay henry
had informed me that he never broke
open his gun to see how close he had been
to death it was his habit to turn the
barrel leave the gun in its accustomed
place till he next sat before the mirror
he would then remove the bullet or bul-
lets for a fresh start
  i had had some bullets made which ex-
actly resembled his forty-fours both in
size and weight but they were harmless
and would produce no more noise than
the click of an empty chamber
 harry i said to him one day at
lunch i have become somewhat fas-
cinated with this game of yours not
that i wish to try it i added hastily as
he gave me a shrewd glance but i
would like to see the thing done-just
once i shivered as i spoke the words
and the shiver was not a piece of acting
  honor bright youd like to see it
done no interference mind
  his delight at my interest overcame
any suspicion that he might have enter-
tained before i assured him that i would
watch in silence
  a week later i dined at his apartment
after the meal he dismissed the man-ser-
vant announcing his willingness to sat-
isfy my desire to see him fight his silent
duel with the devil
 would you do this thing to-night-
anyway i questioned nervously
  i dont know he knitted his brows
i feel a bit bad and it will take but one
bullet to do the trick
  i was about to suggest delay-but only
one bullet four to one surely he
would come through safely after so many
attempts it would be his last risk-and
so well was his little room guarded that
i might never receive the opportunity of
placing the imitation bullets it seemed
my only chance i felt sure that after the
ccontinued to page 

one more thrill
          continued from page 
excitement i could very easily make the
change four to one i let things
take their course
  his hand was steady and his eye clear
as he placed a bullet in the pistol a
quick turn of the barrel then he seated
himself before the mirror placing the re-
volver close behind his ear
  the sensations i experienced as i
peared over his shoulder and into the
glass are not describable
  henry livermore worked the hammer
up and down slowly his eyes steadfast
upon his own shining orbs in the mirror
he seemed to have forgotten my presence
entirely his whole body trembled be-
neath the hand i held upon his shoulder
  entranced i watched the finger which
worked the trigger it paused a moment
then tightened slowly oh so slowly the
hammer rose-and i knew that this was
the period between life and death
  i raised my head and looked into the
glass-looked full into the eyes of my
friend
  a loud report shook the room and in
that mirror i saw a soul go straight to
hell
  that is all gentlemen of the jury it
is unfortunate that i am the beneficiary
under the will i can but say that if you
convict me of murder an innocent man
goes to the chair
 he what did ethel have whe she lost that strip poker
 game last night
 she a royal flush
        billy and ruth were allegedly nice girls billie only  and ruth not
        much older they got along fine except when they quarrelled-which was
        about  per cent of the time

looked at ruby
  she was asleep
drunken man in taxi what do i owe you
taxi-driver 
drunken man back up to sixty cents its all i have
it was not a dark and stormy night the
wind was not moaning through the
trees howling down the chimney or
whistling through the keyhole nor was
the rain coming down in sheets winding
or otherwise or beating a devils tattoo
against the window panes no gentle
reader or rough and tough reader as the
case may be a bell was not tolling the
solemn hour of midnight it was a bright
sunny day in june- oclock in the
afternoon if you insist on statistics birds
twittered in the trees bees hummed their
droning roundelays or whatever kind of
lays it is that bees hum and butterflies
flitted from precipice to precipice and not
a drop to drink
  the body of johnstone green was not
lying on the shabby and inexpensive rug
that covered the unvarnished nakedness
of the bumpy and squeaky floor of his
library it was on the table he was both
prone on his back and supine on his face
mr greene had once been a contortionist
  the old gentleman who was not a mul-
timillionaire a clubman a man about
town nor yet a recluse was not welter-
ing in a pool of his own blood nor was
there a significant stream trickling from a
small round hole in the center of his fore-
head and dripping from the table edge
to form an ugly stain on the rug
  no jeweled or plain dagger hilt pro-
truded from his back or from his shirt
front nor was there a sign of a charay
jambiyah tomahawk meat-axe machete
bolo kris yatagan tulwar dah poniard
paper knife bodkin awl screwdriver
ice pick or other piercing or cutting
weapon or instrument no bloodstained
paper weight lay nearby and there was
not a livid bruise on the temple to show
how the old buzzard had met his timely
death
  the eyes of the corpse were not wide
set and staring the tongue was not pro-
truding and there was no contortion of
the features to show that just before he
the johnstone greene murder mystery
died the old geezer had seen some un-
speakable horror nor were his lips drawn
tightly back in a dreadful unearthly grin
instead the eyes were half closed and
on the wrinkled features was a broad
benignant smile
  the butler ambled into the room carry-
ing a tray on which reposed a well-mixed
absinthe frappe the rhyme tray-
frappe was unintentional they just
happened to sound that way sorry it
was a very adequate frappe with the ice
tinkling merrily in a frost-coated glass
  with a voluntary exclamation of sur-
prise the butler stumbled over the rug
nearly spilling the frappe let me inter-
polate here that the butlers name was
not jeeves hawkins jenkins summers
winters nor fall it was psmith-plain
psmith the p is silent like the r
in bathing
  psmith recovered his balance without
spilling a drop of the frappe then see-
ing the corpse of his master grinning up
at him from the table he shuddered vol-
untarily
  good heavens he exclaimed good
heavens take that foolish grin off your
face you make me nervous
  then he drank the frappe seeing that
the master probably would not want it
this also he did voluntarily it was real-
ly an excellent frappe psmith had seen
some service in new orleans
  deliberately psmith walked to the
writing desk unsystematically he ran-
sacked the ancient and rickety piece of
furniture at last ah at last he found
the paper he was looking for-a sheet of
note paper dipping his non-refillable pen
in the empty inkwell he gazed abstract-
edly at the blank sheet before him
should he write the chief of police the
mayor the coroner or the undertaker
or shouldnt he jeeves i mean psmith
loved to write letters it was his favorite
amusement when there was no serious
drinking to be done
  sudden inspiration seized him he put
pen to paper and began to scribble his
thoughts lubricated by the absinthe
flowed freely but the ink did not how
could it there was no ink so the paper
remained blanker than-just blank what
could be blanker than blank
  hawkins i mean psmith looked blank-
ly at the blank paper
  no soap i mean ink he said oh
bother i guess ill have to use the
phone
  he arose and started for the telephone
once more he stumbled over the rug
gracious me he cursed over his
breath not under it thats the second
time i nearly fell and broke my wrist
watch crystal
  standing before the phone he medi-
tated should he call the morgue the bu-
reau of water the sanitary district or the
dog pound at length he decided to call
up his girl friend
  hello hello he cried as the operator
failed to answer what the hello hello
oh hell
 number please the two sweetly
solemn words all but blasted his ear
drum
 give me haywire i mean haymarket

  a pause a buzz
  hello
  hello whoozis
  the bailiff
  what the bailiff
  sure bailiff hay didnt you ask for
haywire  
  oh shucks i mean a horse a horse
the operator must have given me the
right number i want to report a murder
who did you kill

 politely he was not tall and hawk-faced
 or short and bull-necked he did not wear
 a derby and he wasnt chewing a black
 cigar he had high arches and wore
 leather-soled shoes with narrow toes
 all right call me a liar i suppose if you
 saw a duck-billed platypus you would call
 it a liar too

 dle of a lethal weapon-

 sonal drink first

 hawkins i mean psmith took the
 brown bottle from behind the box of
 corn flakes youre wrong this was a
 different bottle and it was behind the
corn flakes he poured himself a bad
limber drink
  heres to your health mr mr- he
began
  sparelock said the detective
  seems to me ive heard the name be-
fore didnt i see you out with a lady-
that was no lady and it wasnt my
wife
  well mr sparelock unhappy daze
i dont doubt it and now to view the
corpus delecti
 which
 never mind you wouldnt under-
stand come with me i need your moral
support
  but i can scarcely support myself
and i am not moral i drink smoke play
the ukulele-
 hold enough sparelock marched
to the library and entered with jenkins
i mean psmith tramping noisily after
him
  sparelock took one look at the corpse
then cried hah i smell a mouse
wrong again said summers i mean
psmith its the mixture of onions ab-
sinthe and rye even if you dont know
your nose knows
  when did you last see the deceased
alive asked the detective
  guess
  it was at nine this morning
  right but how did you know
  never mind who was with him
  guess again
 hm sparelock picked up a folded
document and examined it without a mi-
croscope hm he did not put down the
document and pace the floor he did not
light a pipe he did not take a shot in
the arm he did not dust it with finger-
print powder hm it was an insurance
salesman named boggs what an odd
name
  right again

the johnstone greene murder mystery
  when did the salesman leave wait
let me answer he left promptly at one
oclock
  check
  and he left in a hurry
  checkmanee he stopped to have a
drink with me
  ah well a mere detail sparelock
walked around the corpse in a clockwise
direction then he turned and walked
around it in a counterclockwise direction
the corpse began to show signs of dizzi-
ness
  suddenly the detective seized the waste
basket and emptied its contents on the
horsehair sofa-one telephone four emp-
ty brown bottles one empty green bot-
tle five corks cigar stubs cigarette stubs
ashes and a tightly wadded ball of paper
  sparelock unwadded the paper and
looked at it without adjusting his glasses
he did not wear glasses if he had worn
glasses he would not have adjusted them
hah he hissed try it on your hisser
if you are skeptical hah  the mystery
is solved this little scrap of paper ex-
plains why johnstone green esquire
went down to an early timely well de-
served and decidedly chilly grave at the
tender age of ninety-seven
 why oh why dont tell me the
suspense is not killing me
  the detective did not snuff his cigar-
ette throw away his cigar knock the
ashes from his pipe or spit out his gum
this is a note in the handwriting of the
deceased it says memo have boggs
tell that funny story about the monkey
and the elephant
  but i dont see- began psmith and
i mean psmith
 you wouldnt johnstone greene
laughed himself to death
she i suppose you havent
seen fido anywhere dear
  the entomologist dont
 worry me now darling ive just
 discovered a new kind of moth that
 barks
think y me
gisino the drug peddler felt oddly
uncomfortable and on edge his
nerves were playing tricks with
him he was jumpy twitchy and he
could not concentrate on his work he
was irritable with the snowbirds he met
furtively in hallways and down alleys
and he snarled at one or two
  in his impatience and nervousness he
even passed out a deck of costly heroin
for the cheaper cocaine thus cheating
himself
  after roundly cursing this example of
carelessness gisino sought the open
street and took stock of himself
  jesu maria said he softly whats
the matter with me anyway im worse
than a junky myself he lit a cigarette
with shaking fingers and stood pondering
  the cigarette tasted rank and he
flipped it away he opened the palm of
his other hand and stared surreptitiously
at the neat packets of drugs therein he
carried his contraband literally in the hol-
low of his hand the better to cast it away
should a roving member of the narcotic
squad heave into sight it was always
open season for pushers like gisino
  the roving dealer in nepenthe shivered
as he looked at the drugs lucky thing
for me he commented that i aint on
the stuff it must be nadas liquor thats
got me going christ i could stand a
jolt of it
  he realized forthwith as he thought
of the liquor that it was the anodyne he
needed for his jangling nerves a craving
was stirring within him-a crawling
deep-seated craving amber mellow
liquor the pure uncut scotch that the
woman nada kept about her apartment
for her numerous guests-paying guests
of the masculine sex-would allay the
craving
  gisino drew a deep breath and decided
to forego business and call upon nada
for some of the scotch perhaps also he
might demand embraces of her as was
his privilege
  he had three more dope-vending ap-
pointments for the afternoon but they
meant little to him there were so many
customers what did it matter if three
particular addicts ridden with drug- hun-
ger were waiting on tenterhooks for him
to appear with his precious tiny packets
-the surcease for agony torment ever
increasing ever tearing would grip these
wretches if he gisino failed to show up
callousedly the drug peddler disregard-
ed them consigned them to suffering
with a practiced eye out for the law he

think of me
hailed a taxi and was driven to nadas
apartment
  oh hello gissy said nada apathe-
tically as she opened the door for him
she was a blonde with a tired young face
and a beautiful inciting body she held
a dressing gown the garb of her calling
about the body the gown was of an
exotic tangerine color behind the cloth
gleamed virginal-looking white skin
gisinos hand dove familiarly inside the
cloth he squeezed a breast teasingly
sadistically laughed as she winced and
went on into the apartment he flopped
into a chair
  bring out some of your scotch nada
he directed peremptorily the whole
bottle jeez i need it
  he spoke truthfully inactive now he
was more than ever upset by the crav-
ing his nerves tensed sweat stood out
upon his face glistened on his hairy
wrists his mouth trembled and he shook
as if he were cold
  the blonde gazed at him silently then
turned and moved listlessly to the rear
the swing of her figure unconsciously
seductive gisinos bright dark eyes fol-
lowed her but with scant longing she
was his woman but he was by no means
in the mood for her now he was beset
tortured by another desire    later
maybe after he had swallowed enough
of the scotch to conquer the crawling in
him he would take her and amuse him-
self with her he got a kick out of car-
essing her abusively hurtfully forcing
her responses her white curved body
was so unresisting
 the woman nada was gone unduly
long gisino sprawled quivering and dis-
traught in his chair came to the end of
his patience
  god damn it woman he railed out
at her shake a leg back there what
are you doing
  the blonde unperturbed reappeared
presently bottle in hand gisino saw with
resentment that she had dressed herself
his thick lips curled away from his teeth
  you would take time to doll yourself
up you bitch he sneered i can sit here
and die for a drink i can 
  yeah she drawled dully well i
gotta dress sometime i cant go around
half-naked forever even if i am in the
business
  he snatched the bottle from her struck
her a back-handed blow as a matter of
habit and then gave his attention to the
whisky eyes burning he tantalized him-
self with it staring at it admiringly then
tipped up the bottle and drank greedily
his gullet moved up and down under a
bluish stubble half the liquor flowed
down his throat he stopped drinking
laid aside the bottle eased back into the
chair he breathed languidly relaxedly
eyes closed
  eventually he looked up he glanced
at the blonde malignantly as if meditat-
ing further chastisement but the liquor
was taking hold mollifying him his
nerves had quit jumping the crawling
had left him he reached indolently into
his pocket for one of the inevitable
cigarettes
  swell liquor you got nada he vouch-
safed magnanimously
  he rested quietly inhaling cigarette
smoke and feeling increasingly calmed
and at peace
  the blonde was watching him her
eyes were purple-flecked and hard
  feel better gissy
  something in her voice roused him from
his lethargy
  yes i feel better he tried to fathom
her expression and failing was vaguely
disturbed whats eatin you nada
you look funny
by hugh l maxwell

  she laughed unpleasantly i feel
funny gissy funny as hell
  he sat erect say are you hopped up
i thought you never used the snow
  her eyes flamed i dont wop she
said passionately its the only thing i
dont do i do everything else thanks
to you i know no limit i go all the
way i do im low and common i take
on all comers youre to blame you
bastard you pulled me down it only
took a year of your life to ruin all of
mine gisino it was a year ago today
that i met you ive been thinking about
it all day
  he was amused anniversary eh
wed oughta celebrate he took a play-
ful drag on his cigarette
  i am celebrating gisino
  he stared at her curiously the vague
disturbance grew what in hell do you
mean
  im celebrating by squaring accounts
gisino you know what youve done to
me i came to this town a silly innocent
little kid and you spoiled me it was
fun for you wasnt it
  his latin face darkened damn right
it was fun and what are you gonna
do about it he stirred belligerently
from his chair
  oh sit down gisino you neednt
beat me up again youve done enough of
that already ive got it all chalked up
against you and now im squaring up for
it- and everything else
  he got to his feet and started to-
wards her he was of a mind to punish
her for impertinence to batter her bruise
her hammer her mercilessly until she
turned beggingly submissive and apolo-
getic that was the sort of treatment
she needed with her catlike treacherous
eyes and cocksure attitude
  he neared her but a strange exulting
look in the purple-flecked eyes halted him
he was puzzled apprehensive
  yes gisino im squaring up for every-
thing
  native cunning told him to be careful
she might have laid a trap for him-im-
ported some bruiser to beat him up or
something she might even be planning
to turn the heat on him it was like these
molls to pull a gun on a euy when they
got worked up
  what are you gonna do you slut
  ive already done it
 done what
 she viewed him levelly listen
gisino do you remember telling we
what an awful thing it is to be on the
dope-how these hopheads suffer when
they cant get the stuff
  he nodded still puzzled
  well gisino youre a hophead your-
self-a snowbird
  youre crazy as hell i never touch
the snow
  oh yes you do ive been feeding it
to you-in the whisky morphine solu-
tion stronger all the time ive been giv-
ing it to you for weeks you didnt notice

think of me
it at first you got used to the taste now
youre hooked-youve been given the
habit youre full of morphine right now
youll never be able to do without it
youre a hophead
  she laughed hysterically youre a
hophead do you hear a hophead-a
junkey you made addicts out of other
people-now youre one yourself youll
suffer you devil out of hell youll suffer
and when you do think of me
  berserk he lunged at her she dodged
gained the door jerked it open darted
through and slammed the door in his face
a night lock clicked and in his agitation
he could not work the catch
  he heard her laughing as she fled on
down the stairs

a story by garrard harris
olonel bolivar warren
of tombigbee mississippi along
about  hit the cotton futures
market for a hundred thousand dollars
and his two daughters immediately in-
sisted the plantation was too lonely-the
family must move to a city where social
careers were possible
  mrs warren was ready for the fray
also and truth to tell the colonel had a
notion he was a napoleon of finance and
could beat the stock market people at
their own game his son tom wanted to
be a lawyer and felt that only in the city
could members of the bar reap the large
rewards
  so the family was ready for the great
adventure paying off the moderate mort-
gage which had been on the place so long
it was an heirloom and putting the plan-
tation in trust for fifty years so any mem-
ber of the family who wished might oc-
cupy it as a haven of refuge the warrens
moved on to urban conquests
  that is to say all except old unclc
ephriam who flatly declined to leave the
comfortable brick cabin he had occupied
some forty years and where as major
domo he had exercised a pleasant and not
too onerous authority uncle eph
strongly disapproved of the move

time youall comes back and dern glad to
git back naw suh i stays thus he
ultimatumed
  one man after another rented the plan-
tation after the warrens left-it grad-
ually became run-down and ramshackle
when cotton went to five cents a pound
it lay vacant two years then a tenant
came on and so did the bollweevil the
tenant left without paying the rent but
the weevils having eaten up the rent
cotton came to permanently abide then
it continued unrented from thence for-
ward
  rumors percolated back to tombigbee
that the family had lost everything and
was on hard lines at any rate ephs
check had long ago ceased from that
source not knowing how to write he
made no inquiries still he stayed on
hoping against hope that some day his
white folks would return he looked after
the place as best he could despite the
steady encroachment of blackberry briers
and sassafras taking fields and lawn
wistaria and virginia creeper were
smothering the old house in natures own
green mantle of charity which hid times
ravages the cedars and mimosas down
the long slope in front were a haven for
mocking birds-their orisons and the
whistling of quail were all that broke the
solitude thereabout
  eph received a pension of ten dollars a
month from the state as a faithful servi-
tor of the confederacy and for several
years the warrens sent him an equal sum
as caretaker he raised a few bales of
cotton chickens too vegetables and
watermelons which he peddled in the
nearby little town being of a saving dis-
position always eph had managed in
some forty years to accumulate three
thousand dollars which was at interest in
the planters bank
  under the thawing influence of several
glasses of potent elderberry wine at sis
calline twickenhams cabin where he
had been invited for a sunday dinner
eph showed his bankbook and indulged
in vainglorious boasting the news spread
like fire in a cotton warehouse sis cal-
line a heavy hearty widow of many
years duration determined then and
there to annex eph who had also lost his
mate in the long ago an plump
satcherfied to be single mer ole ooman
were a powerful fractious pusson de
scalded houn fears de pot-never ergin
fer me eph had confided to a friend
  and yet it was mighty lonesome out
on the place with the white folks gone
and no company or companionship save
his mule his dog and the rabbits and
birds
  two other unattached widows heard
the news about ephs wealth and deter-
minedly entered the lists with sis cal-
line eph began to take on weight and
the luster of his coal-black skin reflected
the plenteous diet many invitations
afforded
  the widow believes in direct action and
she knows what to do to win a man she
feeds-and keeps on feeding him she
flatters him but fills him with tasty
viands before she proceeds to familiarly
gorge his vanity then she urges him to
talk and boast listening with a slavish
and adoring deference as he preens and
struts and crows
  six months of this sort of thing re-
sulted one day in assertion by sis calline
that she was engaged to be married to
eph she said it loudly premeditatedly

don juan of tombigbee
and for a purpose in the presence of sis
luvenia watts and sis pearline tobias
the other two aspirants it was just after
a protracted meeting dismissed at the
life boat african church each coun-
tered promptly with a similar claim as
the crowd gathered
  the resulting discussion was so highly
acrimonious and violent that the services
of three constables were required to sepa-
rate the debaters and land them in the
tombigbee lockup - where hostilities
were resumed at intervals during the
night
  in the magistrates court next day each
belligerent proved that eph was engaged
to her and when the evidence was all in
eph as he hovered on the outskirts of the
crowd felt pretty much the same he
discreetly evaporated from the scene
while lawyer moss was describing his
infamy in breaking the hearts of three
poor bereaved women they punctuated
the attorneys every period with sobs and
whoops of self-pity eph knew in his
soul that as pity is akin to live selfpity
is the preliminary to homocide sometimes
- and the wide spaces called him
urgently
    three hours later when thru his front
window he beheld the three amazons
united in common cause of vengeance
and smarting under fifteen dollar fines
moving in mass formation upon his domi-
cile he also noted that one carried an ax
helve another a pick handle while pear-
line the most tempermental of the three
bore a long shiny butcher knife
  eph sounded like a cyclone as he tore
through the corn patch a hippo on the
rampage could not have trampeled more
cotton as he surged to the river bank
his dugout canoe was barely out of
range when a barrage of stones and brick-
bats followed him the robert e lee on
her historic race with the natchez had
nothing on him as to speed as he went
gulfward down the tombigbee river
 thus it came about that uncle eph
roosted on a cotton bale at the mobile
wharf and moodily pondered he had
escaped the widows but he was afraid
to return he did not know a soul in
mobile to identify him at the bank and
he could not draw a cent of his money a
hundred miles away he had tried for
days to find a job he had achieved peace
a continuity of single blessedness and
a whole hide but it was the peace of
loneliness and utter desolation
  accustomed of late to being enter-
tained fed to repletion upon the best the
hen roosts of quality folks afforded fat-
tened as it were for the matrimonial
sacrifice now that he had to pay in ad-
vance for each morsel of food he found
the problem serious and most depressing
with but ten cents left in his pocket
 autumn sunlight made him drowsy
he nodded and mulled over the situation
he wished he could go back home safely
and not be sued for breach of promise or
poisoned or conjured as a matter of re-
venge consciousness merged into a
dream in which the big-house of the war-
rens again held his white folks people
again passed in and out of the hospitable
doors and there was happiness and life
and contentment
  an unearthly noise jarred him into
tense wakefulness the steamboat excel-
sior loaded for the up-river trip had
moved alongside the wharf to get some
odds and ends of last minute freight and
ship some additional roustabouts she
was blowing a call for hands
  river darkies began to ooze out of the
fried-catfish emporiums and dives along

of the swinging stage the mate stood to
meet and dicker with the hands over pay
he stepped down and walked to where
eph was comfortably reclining

  oh all right-all right-wheres your
plunder
  baggage is right on mer haid and mer
back
get aboard then and get busy
  to the dining saloon eph added just
the right touch while the excelsior
worked freight at selma he went ashore
and in some way managed to acquire an
ancient dress suit white shirt white tie
and white cotton gloves so eminently
respectable was he in his official regalia
so evidently a clorode person of superior
quality that passengers were ashamed to
offer him less than two-bits as a tip thus
proving again the old adage that it pays
to cultivate appearance
  it was a pleasant and profitable life
he was entranced with the river the
boats the ever changing scenery and lib-
eral good humored passengers two
aboard seemed old residents on the ex-
celsior they retained their berths trip
after trip
  eph noticed they seemed devoted to
cards in fact were in a poker game which
started when the boat pulled out from
montgomery and never ended until mo-
bile was reached he asked one of the
older hands on the craft about the men
who were so suave so liberal in small
donations to him when he was fetching
drinks or new decks or cigars the
other darkey eyed him pityingly
  dem you ole lummox aint you got
no eyes deys gambler gemplemums
dey rides dis boat endurin of de cotton
season trimmin de planters on dey way
to mobile an nyaw leens whars yo
eyes-dont you see dey always banks de
game
  pickings were poor for the gambler
gentlemen on the up-trip it was on the
downward cruise that men who came
aboard had wallets plethoric with money
and warehouse receipts for many bales
of cotton and a large and adventure-
some spirit in their bosoms all year they
had drudged making crops and now was
play-time across the green baize table
many of them lost thousands of dollars
  uncle eph became the favorite atten-
dant upon the games and came to know
the card sharps well in turn they found
the naive old darkey could innocently
give them valuable information about
passengers so they rather cultivated him
and were liberal enough in gratuities
  on a trip while the excelsior was load-
ing montgomery for the return uncle
eph strolled uptowrn he noted bradley
and farrish the gamblers entering a
hotel bar with a man whom they seemed
to have in tow and later in company
with the card sharps he came aboard he
was rather ordinary looking somewhere
between  and  years of age and had
a discouraged apologetic way about him
he seemed timorous and indifferent and

his clothes a bit shabby eph paid no
particular attention to him except to note
the gamblers urging him at frequent in-
tervals to the bar once eph saw both
bradley and farrish empty their drinks
on the floor while the man consumed his
 uh huh-somebodys got some money
an is likely to lose hit fore annuder
day was ephs muttered comment to
himself
  the game started right after supper
and bradely was careful to keep the glass
at the mans elbow filled when play
ended at  oclock the stranger was
cleaned out
  shortly after noon next day eph came
upon the man toward the stern of the
boat leaning upon the rail and staring at
the water with an expression upon his
face no man should wear
  eph sidled up to him for a flash of an
idea had come to him as he glimpsed the
mans tired grief-stricken eyes
  capn i been watchin you ever since
i fust seed you in mongomery an i
wants to ask is you any relashun to de
tombigbee warrenses
 my name is warren-why-look here
is this uncle eph im tom
  de good land er de lawd
  their hands clasped and each searched
the countenance of the other
  mist tommy whar is you been an
de rest of de fambly
  father lost all the money he made-
died in three years after he left mother
lingered along and she died too in a few
years the girls are married-and fairly
well i might say
  an what does you do fer a livin mist
tommy 
  uncle eph im the most unanimous
failure that ever lived tried law and
all the time my mind was on hunting and
fishing green fields blue skies and the
cotton ready to gather tried newspaper
work and then i finally slipped down
to where i got to be just an ordinary plug
bookkeeper
  you belongs out on de land
  i know it the love of the outdoors
is as strong in my children and my wife
as it is with me so we decided i was
to take my little savings come back
south and see if i could not land a posi-
tion as bookkeeper or manager of the
commissary on some big plantation or
buy an interest in a business in some
small town where we could be together
and at any rate closer to the life we all
love and now-that hope is gone
why dont you go up an farm de old
home place
  on account of the trust father left on
it i cant borrow a cent on it and you
ought to know it takes money to get a
start planting i have only a few dollars
left after my infernal folly
  how much dem fellers git offn you
  a thousand dollars
 good goshamighty what you gwine
do
 heavens only knows-i dont
there was a long silence while the two
men stared at the yellow current slipping
by
  what fambly has you mist tommy
wife and two youngsters-a boy and
a girl my wife is a brave fine woman
shes been giving music lessons to help
me get up this money ive thrown away
i ought to be killed they are living in

don juan of tombigbee
a cheap mean house on a cheap mean
street in a great big lonely city and ive
ruined their chance to get away
  i sholy would like to see dem chillen
-speshually dat boy an make some
boats for him an tell him tales about de
varmints an dey carryins on an animule
talk is he name tommy too
  warren nodded affirmation silence fell
upon them broken only by the rhythmic
splash of paddle wheels and soft sighing
of exhaust pipes
  mist tommy does yo lil boy look
like you useter look
  he is  and they say he is the image
of me when i was that age-his sister
is 
  lawsy how id like to be back at de
old place an have a lil feller to play wid
an look after an make him happy
  a tear crept down warrens cheek his
boy had never known the joy of being out
in the open he had never seen a wild
rabbit or ridden a horse or heard the
lore of denizens of wood and field he
had never had the thrill of catching a
sunfish out of the creek nor of picking
blackberries and being taught to swim in
a crystal stream his little girl had never
heard a mocking bird or the piping of a
cardinal nor filled her arms with gar-
denias from a hedge nor gathered a spray
of honeysuckle with the dew and the
dawn upon it
  eph wiped his eyes with the back of
his hand he knew and he understood
  mist tommy he said is got some
money in de bank you take hit an make
a start on de place ill go back dere wid
you an take a chance on what we makes
an not draw no wages we can shorely
scratch out a good livin ef nothin else
dear old friend i thank you but i
cant take your little savings
  again the two men lapsed into ab-
stracted silence as they mused on the
swirling water their minds full of the
long ago
  mist tommy if you had yo money
back would you reely be willin to go on
de home place an make a start
  i dont think any power on earth
could keep me away as you say we cer-
tainly could scratch out a living and lots
of happiness along with it for all of us
eph finally went forward to his duties
he saw bradley the gambler eyeing him
from a distance he sauntered around a
corner of the deck then with a wink and
an almost imperceptible nod beckoned
the gambler to come after eph led the
way to bradleys stateroom inside with
the door closed the old negro tremblingly
made disclosure
  boss hells a-popin fer sure i jes
wormed it out of dat man i was talkin
to-lemme tell you he began in a low
intense voice surcharged with excite-
ment fifteen minutes later eph slipped
out tucking a brand new yellow-backed
twenty-dollar bill in his pocket bradley
hurried to find farrish and have a con-
ference
  eph found tom warren looking over
the rail again it is not good for dis-
couraged and down-and-out people to
gaze at water too constantly there are
little voices that call and call and whis-
per of rest and surcease from trouble
mist tommy i wants you to do me

earnestness
