to persons who have not previously
heard of my method this may seem a
pretty bold statement but i will gladly
convince you of its accuracy by referring
you to any number of my graduates in
any part of the world

there isnt a state in the
union that doesnt contain a
score or more skilled players of
the piano or organ who obtained
their entire training from me by
mail i have far more students
than were ever before taught by
one man investigate by writ-
ing for my -page free booklet
itow to learn piano or organ

    my way of teaching piano or
 organ is entirely different from all
 others out of every four hours
 of study one hour is spent en-
 tirely away from the keyboard-
 learning something about har-
 mony and the laws of music
 this is an awful shock to most
 teachers of the old school who
 still think that learning piano
 is solely a problem of finger
 gymnastics when you do go
 to the keyboard you accomplish
 twice as much because you -
 derstand what you are doing
 within four lessons i enable you
 to play an interesting piece not
 only in the original key but in
 all other keys as well

i make use of every possible
scientific help-many of which
are entirely unknown to the
average teacher my patented
invention the colorotone
sweeps away playing difficulties
that have troubled students for
generations by its use trans-
position-usually a nightmare
to students-becomes easy and
fascinating with my fifth les-
son i introduce another im-
portant and exclusive invention
quinn-dex quinn-dex is a
simple hand-operated moving
picture device which enables you
to see right before your eyes
every movement of my hands at
the keyboard you actually see the fingers move
instead of having to reproduce your teachers finger
movements from memory-which cannot be always
accurate-you have the correct models before you
during every minute of practice the colorotone

and quinn-dex save you months and years of wasted
effort they can be obtained only from me and there
is nothing else anywhere even remotely like them

  men and women who have failed by all other methods
have quickly and easily attained success when studying
with me in all essential ways you are in closer touch
with me than if you were studying by the oral method-
yet my lessons cost you only  cents each-and they
include all the many recent developments in scientific
teaching for the student of moderate means this
method of studying is far superior to all others and even
for the wealthiest students there is nothing better at any
price you may be certain that your progress is at all
times in accord with the best musical thought of the
present day and this makes all the difference in the world

would not recommend any course but the best it is for

free proof that i can
raise your pay

no matter how much you are earning now i can
show you how to increase it i have even taken
failures and shown them how to make -
and in one case as high as  weekly i am
willing to prove this entirely at my risk and expense

iets have a little chat about getting ahead
-you and i my name is pelton lots
of people call me the man who makes
men rich i dont deny it ive done
it for thousands of people-lifted them up
from poverty to riches

  im no genius-far from it im just a
plain everyday unassuming sort of man i
know what poverty is ive looked black
despair in the eye-had failure stalk me around
and hoodoo everything i did ive known the
bitterest kind of want

  but to-day all is different i have money
and all of the things that money will buy i
am rich also in the things that money wont
buy-health happiness and friendship few
people have more of the blessings of the world
than i

  it was a simple thing that jumped me up
from poverty to riches as ive said im no
genius but i had the good fortune to know
a genius one day this man told me a
secret it had to do with getting ahead
and growing rich he had used it himself
with remarkable results he said that every
wealthy man knew this secret-that is why
he was rich

  i used the secret it surely had a good
test at that time i was flat broke worse

than that for i was several thou-
sand dollars in the hole i had
about given up hope when i put
the secret to work

at first i couldnt believe my
sudden change in fortune money actually
flowed in on me i was thrilled with a new
sense of power things i couldnt do before
became as easy for me to do as opening a door -
my business boomed and continued to leap
ahead at a rate that startled me prosperity
became my partner since that day ive never
known what it is to want for money friend-
ship happiness health or any of the good
things of life

  that secret surely made me rich in every
sense of the word

  my sudden rise to riches naturally sur-
prised others one by one people came to
me and asked me how i did it i told them
and it worked for them as well as it did for
me

  some of the things this secret has done
for people are astounding i would hardly
believe them if i hadnt seen them with my
own eyes adding ten twenty thirty or forty
dollars a week to a mans income is a mere
nothing thats merely playing at it in
one case i took a rank failure and in a few
weeks had him earning as high as 
a week listen to this

  a young man in the east had an article
for which there was a nation-wide demand
for twelve years he puttered around with

kindly mention adventure in writing to advertisers or visiting your dealer
adventure

it barely eking out a living to-day this
young man is worh  he is build-
ing a  home-and paying cash for
it he has three automobiles his children
go to private schools he goes hunting fish-
ing traveling whenever the mood strikes
him his income is over a thousand dollars
a week

  in a little town in new york
lives a man who two years ago
was pitied by all who knew
him from the time he was 
he had worked and slaved--
and at sixty he was looked
upon as a failure without
work-in debt to his charitable
friends with an invalid son to
support the outlook was pitchy
black

a few examples

  then he learned the secret
in two weeks he was in business
for himself in three months
his plant was working night and
day to fill orders during 
the profits were  dur-
ing  the profits ran close to
 and this genial -
year young man is enjoying
pleasures and comforts he little
dreamed would ever be his

  i could tell you thousands of
similar instances but theres
no need to do this as im willing
to tell you the secret itself

then you can put it to work
and see what it will do for you

  i dont claim i can make you rich over
night maybe i can-maybe i cant some-
times i have failures--everyone has but i
do claim that i can help  out of every 
people if they will let me

  the point of it all my friend is that you
are using only about one-tenth of that wonder-
ful brain of yours thats why you havent
won greater success throw the unused nine-
tenths of your brain into action and youll be
amazed at the almost instantaneous results

  the will is the motive power of the brain with-
out a highly trained inflexible will a man has about
as much chance of attaining success in life as a rail-
way engine has of crossing the continent without
steam the biggest ideas have no value without will-
power to put them over yet the will altho here-
tofore entirely neglected can be trained into wonderful
power like the brain or memory and by the very same
method-intelligent exercise and use

  personal experiences

   among over  users of
 power of will are such men
 as judge ben b lindsey su-
 preme court justice parker wu
 ting fang ex u s chinese
 ambassador assistant postmas-
 ter general britt gov mckel-
 vie of nebraska general man-

 salary jumped prom 
 to 
 since i read power of will
 my salary has jumped from 
 to  a month-j f gibson
 san diego cat

 from t a month

   one of our boys who read
 power of will before he came over
 here jumped from  a month to
  the first month and won

 leslie a still a e f france

   if you held your arm in a sling for two years it
would become powerless to lift a feather from lack
of use the same is true of the will-it becomes
useless from lack of practice because we dont use
our wills-because we continually bow to circum-
stance-we become unable to assert ourselves what
our wills need is practice

  develop your will-power and money will flow in
on you rich opportunities will open up for you
driving energy you never dreamed you had will
manifest itself you mil thrill with
a new power-a power that nothing
can resist youll have an influence
over people that you never thought
possible success-in whatever form
you want it-will come as easy as
failure came before and those are
only a few of the things the secret
will do for you the secret is fully
explained in the wonderful book
power of wiu

how you can prove this at
my expense

      i know youll think that ive
  claimed a lot perhaps you think
  there must be a catch somewhere
  but here is my offer you can
  easily make thousands-you cant
  lose a penny

to most of us an aquarium seems
an unlikely place for a diver to
choose in which to spend a holiday
sam manning thought differently
and the aquarium at kapiolani park at
waikiki is different it is an out-of-doors
institution and one may smoke and watch
the strange shapes and vivid colors of the
occupants of the tanks in a combination of
pleasure and comfort that was most accept-
able to manning

  romance and poetry to the contrary
your deep-sea diver does not take in much of
the sub-surface life while hes at work
there are too many things to look out for
life-line air-pipe signals currents to say
nothing of the actual work in hand then
too the helmet-glasses get misty in spite of
the vinegar film used to keep them clear
like as not the water is roily and it is ten
to one the diver is working in a place that
more nearly resembles a neglected back-
yard than a sea-garden aglow with color

  but there was a streak of romance and
not a narrow one in the composition of
manning and when he could do so at

leisure he liked to see through the glass of
the tanks the tropical underwater beau-
ties that he missed at pearl harbor where
he had just completed a contract at the
naval station

  striped and splotched trigger-fish in blue
and gold or black and scarlet strange
darting shapes of silver azure and flaming
red spotted eels sulking squid gorgeous
anemones like orchids of the sea vivid
marine growths spiny sea-urchins night-
mare crabs live coral live sponges a
fascinating display ever shifting in kaleido-
scopic review manning refilled his pipe
seated in the scattering shade of date-palms
opposite the tank labeled hippocampidce
which manning translated as sea-horses

  he played chess once in a while and the
striking resemblance of the mailed fishes
with their prehensile tails and elongated
snouts to the knights of his favorite diver-
sion always fascinated him just now his
attention was divided between them and a
man whom he had observed more or less
closely for the past hour

  the stranger was a riddle to manning and

adventure

the diver liked to solve such riddles to
begin witk he was dressed in a slop suit
of serge that was shapeless as a collection of
gunny sacks but could not hide the erect
figure the broad square shoulders and
narrowing hips of the man he was pain-
fully thin but manning sensed muscles and
well-coordinated strength and action clad
like a common sailor evidently of the sea
manning was sure that the man belonged
aft that he was one who gave orders rather
than obeyed them

  he was pretty certain that the man was
both hungry and broke he knew that the
stranger had glanced at him more than once
with a look that was a part of the puzzle
it had held a hint of entreaty only a
hint tempered by pride that showed in the
tilt of the well-shaped jaw the carriage of
the well-shaped head it was a tentative
hail to one who might or might not answer
in kind

  in the look had been a suggestion of recog-
nition and this manning reciprocated to
a certain extent he could not place the
man and he prided himself upon his recol-
lection of faces their former meeting
must have been under different circum-
stances he decided the chap had been
through a sickness of some kind he fancied
clothes and additional poundage made a
vast difference

  hes a yank decided manning but
hes no stranger in these latitudes and
hes got a good nose

  manning was a crank on noses he liked
the way the stranger if he was a stranger
wore his jutting out in an aquiline aggres-
siveness from between gray eyes curving
down lean and well sculptured ending
above a close-clipped mustache that ac-
cented a firm mouth

  about thirty he placed his age man-
ning had just topped forty the other was
close to six feet perhaps a trifle over the
fathom manning was five-feet-ten solid
vigorous

  the man regarded the fishes apatheti-
cally hands in his pockets frowning op-
posite the juippocampida the tank might
have been empty for any real attention he
gave it though he was looking straight at
the glass front that reflected his lean visage
to manning who once again thought he
caught that speculative glance

  hes no panhandler the diver decided
i like him and he looks as if he needed a

lift if its only a friendly word rum
place for him to come if hes feeling the way
he looks

  generous always with the generosity
happily leavened by inherent caution and a
habit of going about things methodically
manning got up and strolled over nearer
to the sea-horses ranging up alongside the
other

  funny little beggars aint they he
said dont seem like fishes somehow
ran into a whole herd of em one time
he went on as the other did not answer
herded in the cabin of a wreck i was goin
through in twelve fathom of water ill
bet there was four or five hundred of em
the man turned swiftly eagerness in his
eyes his thin body tensing

  youre a diver

  the gray eyes were ablaze with hope bor-
ing at manning there was the note in his
voice of a marooned sailor who almost hope-
less suddenly sees a ships boat coming
round the point and hails it with a certain
incredulity it was a deep-sea voice with a
ring to it that confirmed mannings im-
pression that the man was used to issuing
orders

  thats been my job for twenty-odd
years he answered name of manning
sam manning

  manning-manning

  the brows of the other knitted lines of
effort showing above them in a struggle for
recollection then his face cleared

  you were at tahiti in-let me see-
 working on the hull of the espe-
rance

  correct

  manning still cudgeled his brains in vain
for the connecting links of memory

  i used to watch you from the wharf
dont know that i met you but you may
have heard of me i was there selling
pearls my names hooper tom hooper
of huapai

  now his voice held a note of entreaty
it was almost as if he had had reason lately
to doubt his own identity or had had it
questioned manning thought shrewdly

  it seems to fit in somewhere he said
slowly but i cant just place it pearls
and youve got the handle of captain im
thinking

  hooper nodded a trifle impatiently

  i dont look much like hooper of huapai
just now he said i met one man this
no mans island



morning who pughtto know me and he said
he didnt i am not sure whether he lied or
not but tom hoper of huapai is fairly
well known in tahiti or was lucky
hooper they called me i handled more
pearls than the rest of them my own
tahiti is the clearing-house for pearls you
know

  yes ive heard so ive never dived
for em never had anything to do with

em but-

  mannings face suddenly lightened

  did you own the three-masted schooner
in the harbor that time the only three-
master there a beauty-called the-

the-

  moanamanu the ocean bird

  yes sir the moanamanu i remem-
ber that schooner ive always had a no-
tion to own a schooner myself ive put in
so much of my life under the surface i like
to sail on top by contrast forjthe joy of it
sail-not steam a beauty that schooner
shes not with you

  shes lying in ten fathoms inside a
double reef half-way between the galapa-
gos and the marquesas

  tough luck you ran her ashore

  i didnt but i was in her

  the man who had named himself hooper
lucky hooper of huapai had been sub-
jecting manning to close inspection a
searching inquisition that began and ended
eyes to eyes and manning did not resent
it inwardly he chuckled the apparent
derelict had assumed the act of investiga-
tion conducting it as a natural privilege
he liked the rising of hooper above clothes
and obvious circumstance

  you said you were a diver queried
hooper after a quick glance to see if any one
was in earshot or so manning interpreted
it deep-sea i take it

  anything down to twenty fathoms
  are you working

  just got through havent made up
my mind whether ill sign up again or not
im a bit stale after a steady spell expect
to lay off for a week or so anyway
hooper nodded

  got your own outfit i suppose

  two suits one with oxygen tank four
assistants why

  he countered sharply with the question
a grim twist of an approving smile showed
on hoopers face

  you may imagine im not rolling in

wealth just now he said but theres a
reason i think i can explain it satis-
factorily to you his voice got a little
bitter but changed again i know the
kind of job you did at tahiti he went on
i know your reputation youve only got
a hazy recollection of me i am not in a
position to offer credentials and i amjin
a hurry to offset what i know of you
and you dont know of me ill give you a
share in my secret its a business proposi-
tion i need a partner i need a diver
have you got any money manning

kf such a conversation overheard
istil might have seemed incongruous

     the wrong man appeared to be
putting a question of that kind but it did
not seem out of the way to manning odd
bits of memory were piecing themselves
together about hooper of huapai and he
did not doubt that this was the man he
was quite certain the chap was neither
crook nor adventurer

  he had met many of them in his calling
and invariably there had been something
about them that gave them away they
had been too specious too overdressed for
their roles one way or the other this
chap was straight in his opinion and he had
taken some time that morning to make it
up once fixed manning was ready to
back it

  i might get hold of some he said
why why a diver sunken treasure

  yes sounds fishy i suppose man
told me so this morning the minute i
broached it said honolulu was fed up on
those sorts of yarns he meant the coco
island expedition the old scallawag that
put across that deal let in a bunch of hono-
lulu men ive been told a good many
things in the last forty-eight hours that i
couldnt resent openly i look like a beach-
comber ill admit its sunken treasure
pearls inside the hold of the moanamanu
and its a strange sort of yarn with only
my word to prove it i was discharged
from the seamans home two days ago
with a dollar and this suit of slops but
ive got to take in some one you look like
a godsend doubly because youre a diver
theres a double reason to my mind for
haste though you may not look at it in
that way but i can offer you an induce-
ment if you take any stock in what im
saying


adventure

  theres a third of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars in it manning for
your share if youll put up for a craft of
some sort outfit grub and crew the
diving part of its easy the rest isnt
there are risks

  manning looked at a sea-horse twined
about a stalk of seaweed

  suppose you come back with me on the
car to honolulu he said and talk it
over ive got rooms there where we can go
over the thing at length well have supper
together and go into it afterward im
hungry

  something leaped into hoopers eyes at
the word supper hunger is a hard
thing to control but his voice was
even

  suits me he said what have we
got to go by have you got any charts
there of the southern pacific

  thats my business yes ive got a lot
of them he glanced at his watch
we can just catch a car he said come
along

  there were two or three soldiers on the
car part of the island garrison manning
saw hooper regarding them interestedly

  making quite a military and naval base
out of the islands he remarked casually
big work at pearl harbor with a general
eye to the japanese i fancy theyre
swarming here eight of em on this car
but i hope we dont have any more trouble
for a while got a chance for real pre-
paredness now good thing the wars
over

  were you in it

  the inquiry was not casual manning
looked at hooper with some surprize
the tone was bitter there was a flash in his
eyes

  i was under it manning answered
i did what they set me at it didnt take
me across kept me busy at the navy
yards how about you

  i was out of it said hooper his voice
bitter but it wasnt my fault and

now the wars over or as good as over-

it

  the repressed feeling in his words ending
in the clipped oath gave manning food for
thought it made him the keener to hear
hoopers story but he was not going to
talk about it on the car if the other had
seemed willing and hooper relapsed into
a broody silence

              ii

sam manning master diver
had cozy quarters in a narrow short
and twisty lane that runs between
beretania and king streets three of his
assistants were quartered elsewhere between
contracts the fourth fong a chinaman
of placid countenance and uncertain age
acted as mannings cook and house-
boy

  fong was a man of parts he had been
with manning for eight years after the
diver had rescued him from a nasty bit of
trouble at singapore for which he be-
lieved fong with reason grateful in
many ways he was invaluable he could
repair a diving-suit as deftly as he could
scramble eggs or make a bed manning
trusted him at the air-pump fong had
even gone down successfully with the suit
that had the oxygen gas-tank attachment

  after supper while manning and hooper
smoked fong clattcred with the dishes
then poked his head in at the door

  me go along chinatown now he said
you wan something mo

  youll bunk here tonight hooper
fong fix up a bed got plenty of hot
water

  that all fix said fong with a grin
he had an uncanny way of forestalling
things but manning wondered a little i
sabe him stop fong went on i fix um
bed put out pajamas fix um wateh fo
bath all time i sabe capn hoopeh
plenty too much he skinny now but i sabe
him along that time tahiti sabe him
ship tlee masts schooneh

his grin widened at the look of astonish-
ment on both their faces manning knew
the capacity of fongs memory hooper
narrowed his eyes and then his face cleared
you knew my cook qui ling

  sure qui ling sabe me plenty
where qui ling now

  a shadow darkened hoopers face

  i dont know fong i wish i did i
hope hes safe

huh qui ling he plenty sabe to take
care of qui ling he win foty dollar from
me that time along tahiti goo night
theres an endorsement said manning
as the door closed

  out of the sky

  good enough for me rejoined man-
ning im glad it happened hooper
no mans island



 not that i doubted you but for your own
 sake

   im glad myself ive got a queer yarn
 to spin where are those charts
 manning produced the roll and hooper
 selected one of them he flattened it on
 the table fong had cleared weighting it
 down with books and picked up a pencil
 poising it for a minute and then bringing it
 down with a light swoop that left a dot on
 the map in a wide space of ocean

    there it is he said due north of
 faster island close to the line one
 hundred and nine-twenty east longitude
 three-seventeen south i wont swear to
 the exact reckoning but its close enough
 and its the only landfall within thirteen
 hundred miles north south east or west
 i got at the figures with some difficulty
 but theyll serve

    all right said manning his eyes on the
  tiny speck go ahead hooper

    i am going to cut it as short as possible
  said hooper its all past history if
  you are interested when i get through ill
  enlarge on details

   here is huapai he used the pencil
 again to indicate the position lies
 between the paumotus and the tubuai
 archipelago belongs to neither the
 chief i bought it from owed no sovereignty
 to france it was my headquarters i
 went in for pearls hunting virgin lagoons
 looking up half-born atolls where there is no
 soil on the reef as yet with the coral awash
 they are the richest i was a pearl pros-
 pector and i made a study of the game
 both of finding and selling

   i had been holding ever since the war
 started waiting for it to end and prices to
 go up but i forgot about the pearls after i
 read about belgium all my news came by
 way of tahiti and i got it in chunks i
 thought america would have to get into the
 scrap i knew i would sooner or later
 the lusitania settled it i started for san
 francisco in the moanamanu on a four-
 thousand - mile trip as a steamer would
 v make it i took my pearls along i didnt
 know just what i was going to do except
 to offer jy services as sailing-master

    i had a vague idea of buying or building
 a fast chaser for submarines with my pearl
 sales i thought they would have their
 u-boats in the pacific before long i took
 along my supercargo thompson who was
 as eager to get into it as i was neilssen

first mate of the schooner scandinavian and
neutral pulu the second mate tahitian
and my fullcrew of tahiti boys i figured
to send them all back under pulu from
san francisco either in the schooner or by
steamer

  we barely got half-way the wind
failed between the trades as usual but we
had worked up to about two hundred miles
south and west of clipperton island when
the german raider came tearing opt of the
eye of the sun and chucked a shell across
our bows it was heave to or sink we
flew the american flag and youd have
thought us small game for them but we
suited their purpose all was fair to them in
war and they took us

  i wasnt overpolite to them they
couldnt understand why i had nothing in
the hull and only a little trade stuff aboard
and i told them plainly that i was on my
way up to the u s a to join in the scrap
i wasnt even politic i was boiling over
at the time the raider sent an ober-
leutnant aboard by the name of steiner and
i insisted on pretending his name was
schweiner which didnt help matters

  he told me america would never get
into the war unless it was on the side of
germany he told me the vessels in the
pacific trade were getting a bit shy of
raiders and that they were going to use the
moanamanu for a decoy they shipped
off pulu all the native boys and qui ling
my cook in two of my boats to get to land
as best they could let them take grub
and water and let me give them their
reckoning and a compass pulu is a good
man and i hope they made it they were
right in the equatorial counter-current and
that helped them neilssen they took
aboard the raider

  thompson wasnt backward about say-
ing how he felt about things and steiner
after he had signaled the raider told us we
two were too eager to get into the fighting
to be given a seat in the boats we might
get through so we were to be kept on the
schooner because they were a bit crowded on
the raider that was a fast steamer taken
from some south american line german
owned i wouldnt wonder if it had been
built with the purpose in mind steiner
brought a few men aboard and they tried
to make me and thompson help navigate
when we wouldnt they stowed us in the
trade-room


adventure

	they fitted up a wireless on the
schooner the raider would stay below
the horizon and the schooner would sail
along sending out s o s signals and flying
a flag of distress when a ship would
answer giving position and coming up the
raider would get ready and thompson
and i would see the whole thing through the
ports

  it worked well they didnt get my
pearls i stowed them in a belt the
minute they fired the shell at me and when
i knew we wejre to be kept aboard and how
they were going to use the schooner i hid
them in a safe place before they thought to
search me if i couldnt have them myself
i wasnt going to make them a present of a
quarter of a million dollars worth of
pearls

never mind the details of what
they did the wars over they
played their game too long it
couldnt last forever landed or picked-up
boats crews gave the details and an austra-
lian battle-cruiser came scooting up over the
horizon one afternoon under forced draft
flinging steel there was a nasty sea run-
ning it was working up to a gale but it
would have done your heart good to see that
shooting the raider was making a run-
ning fight of it and both of them came up
fast toward us in the schooner where
thompson and i had our eyes glued to the
glass of the ports yelling at every hit i
imagine the raider made all of twenty-two
knots but the cruiser was on top of her
with thirty with bigger guns and longer
range

  it was like boys throwing rocks at a can
in a mill-pond with the raider the can and
mighty accurate throwing lead-colored
sea leaden clouds over the lowering sun
the lead-colored cruiser coming up hand
over hand spewing fire and steel and the
raider limping along over the angry sea
going down a mass of smoke and flame
stern first

  then they turned their attention to us
i dont suppose they knew we were aboard
that was part of the fortune of war ill
say this for steiner he knew how to
handle my schooner it was getting dark
wind and sea were heavy we were a hard
mark to hit and though we could only guess
at what they were doing on deck i know he
shortened canvas and reduced the target

while keeping all sail she could stand in that
gale

  squalls were breaking and steiner sailed
right into the heart of one clawing into it
curtained off from the cruiser it must
have blotted us right out but the cruiser
kept after us and one shell got our main-
mast grooving half its thickness away

  we fled through that night like a booby
with a broken wing before a hurricane
the mainmast went by the board and we
could hear them trampling the deck and
cutting the mast away where it banged
against the side a gale is always worst
to those below it seemed to me the
hardest i have ever known every hour
that wind strengthened we couldnt keep
our feet and slid about the floor in the
lurch and lunge of the schooner they had
taken all the furnishings out of the trade-
room but the shelves a small table and a
couple of chairs but we had a rare time
dodging those in the dark with a flash of
phosphorus whenever a wave surged along
over the ports the moanamanu was flung
from surge to surge like a chip in a millrace
helm and sail useless ive an idea we
were under bare poles with maybe a rag of
headsail

  we lost the cruiser inevitably i reckon
it was about two in the morning when we
struck im combining what i learned
later with what i knew at the time man-
ning somewhere about two in the morn-
ing we hit the outer reef of the island
steiner named scfnvarzklippen-black cliffs
it was a thousand to one shot that we ever
struck it though currents may have helped
swing us to it it has a double reef there
are two entrances not opposite each other
and we didnt find either of them in that
welter of storm

  we hurdled that first barrier without
striking and we crashed across the inner
reef with the coral ripping out the lower
strakes and leaving us hung up by one jag
of rock in her stem bows down and in the
lagoon wind and wave still battering at us

  even that gale could not do much to
that twice-belted lagoon the spume was
flying like wet snow in a blizzard and the
wind lashed at the sheltered water but
compared to the turmoil outside it was a
millpond steiner got off two boats one
splintered into toothpicks when it was
launched

  they may have forgotten us but they
no mans island



left us in the traderoom locked up we
tore the shelves down and used the table
and chairs for clubs and rams with the
water rising fast to our waists on the slant-
ing floor once the schooner lurched and
we went down striking out in that trap
believing it was all over

  but we smashed the door down and
scraped through the panels scrambling on
deck and going overside just as a big wave
all streaky with green fire came thundering
over the outer reef shattered gathered
itself came on and spent its strength on
the stern of the old moanamanu sending it
to the bottom in ten fathoms well inside the
lagoon my pearls inside of her

  thompson and i made a little beach in a
bit of a cove that bottomed a wrinkle in an
obsidian cliff black sand we found it
when the dawn came thompson had his
scalp torn somehow and i was badly bruised
but we were safe for the time and we found
some mussels to chew no water no fire
we were glad to lie in the sun and nurse
ourselves for a bit

  we didnt know then if the germans
had got ashore or not but while we were
talking things over a whale-boat passed us
with steiner in the stern sheets and the men
rowing the german man-of-war stroke
choppy and hard they saw us but paid
no attention they were out looking for
stuff from the wreck presently they came
back loaded up and went by us ss if we
had been a couple of penguins in an hour
or so they returned and picked us up

  schwarzklippen is made up of a hollow
crater with a narrow promontory leading to
a cone that cone is covered with bush and
palms the inner walls of the crater
sloping to the lagoon the same with two or
three streams cascading down all the time
on the slope facing the sea the wall is
terraced partly by nature partly by man
and paved with great blocks a fathom long

  on the lower terrace there are great
images of gray lava with crowns of red
tufa on their heads all the way from four
feet to forty on their pedestals staring out
to sea the same sort of images they have
on easter island put there by the same
prehistoric race i imagine the natives on
the island are a tribe of melanesians under a
chief named tiburi they have only been
there for about five generations and they
know nothing about the origin of the stat-
ues they only worship them

  behind the statues there are caves run-
ning away back and communicating with
caves on the beach below them that are
filled with water even at ebb tide steiner
made his camp on the terrace thompson
and i were allowed to build a grass house
on the beach they kept the whale-boat
in one of the lower caves with the oars and
mast taken up to the camp when they were
not used

  thompson and i were allowed to do all
the work we could stagger under we
fished for them and gathered fruit and did
kitchen chores we were prisoners to them
who were also prisoners of the sea i dont
know that they treated us overbadly though
they werent overconsiderate

  the natives came around in canoes that
first afternoon and some of them clambered
down trails on the crater slopes they
tried to make a demonstration and got the
worst of it steiner had managed to get
arms ashore and some ammunition later
he made friends with them in a wav
they thought he and his men were gods
they had a different idea about us until we
convinced em to the contrary

  steiner showed tiburi a few tricks and
fixed up some sort of a pact that lasted until
they began to get familiar with the women
and carried off some of the younger ones
then tiburi sulked and went off to the
cone he was still afraid of the guns
some of the natives stuck with steiner
those who didnt get along with tiburi for
one reason and another

  they showed steiner and his crowd how
to make kawa and white alcohol from the
root of the ti plant they began to spend
most of their time drinking and singing
and steiners authority weakenedt disci-
pline got slack and tiburi attacked but
they beat him off the promontory is a
regular knife-edge and steiner didnt dare
tackle it to clean them up

  they made us rig a flagstaff for them
on top of the cliff and the women made a
flag of bark paper and colored it red white
and black it was flying day by day for a
possible ship we hauled up wood for a
signal - fire but there was small chance
of using it steiner had his sextant and
saved a chronometer and worked out the
position as i gave it to you i fancy he
was accurate i got it out of one of the men
when he was drunk it looked hopeless enough
the island is uncharted and likely to be


adventure

  but they had their boat saidjmanning
why didnt they provision up and get
away

  the boat wouldnt hold more than six-
teen and there were twenty-three of them
said hooper they talked about it but
none of them would consent to stay and let
the rest go afraid what tiburi would do
to them theyd have gone into the ovens
and they knew it steiner suggested draw-
ing lots but they wouldnt hear to it and
there was no hardwood on the island to
build a ship with nothing but brush and
palms and pithwood trees

        they fished up a spar or so from
the schooner with odds and ends of
line and tarpaulin and canvas but
they couldnt lift the hull i used to look
at it when we were fishing in the lagoon or
out on the inner reef the knowledge my
pearls were there safe kept me going kept
up my resolution to get away two of the
men watched down on the beach each
night armed both to prevent our stealing
the boat or letting the natives get it

  our clothes wore out and our shoes
we went native fashion and thompson and
i got covered with yaws and coral scratches
they kept us working as long as we could
standfand any of them thought of some-
thing for us to do we had twenty-three
masters to serve

  i meant to steal the whale-boat and
make for the marquesas and thompson
was game the galapagos were out of the
question with the prevailing winds and the
south equatorial current against us it
seemed a crazy scheme for twofhalf-starved
men to tackle with scant chance of pro-
visioning-seventeen hundred miles in an
open boat but we were half-crazy i
reckon 

  v e made a couple of paddles and a mast
and hid them we braided a big mat sail
from pandcmus working in the dark when
they thought we were asleep i stole bits
of rope for rigging and spliced them we
dried fish and thompson stole two cala-
bashes from the natives for water at the
last we gathered a lot of young coconuts to
supplement them

  the night we got away it was moonless
and still the crowd was howling out
songs on the terrace until midnight when
it died down we sneaked up on our
guards they were careless by this time

and figured we hadnt any spirit left never
dreamed of us tackling the open boat i
reckon we strong-armed them tied them
up and gagged them and we got clear

  there was a wind outside the reef and
by morning we were well away maybe
they sent canoes after us but we never saw
them i wont tell you what we went
through dont recollect a quarter of it
we didnt make the marquesas a peru-
vian bark picked us up on the callao-
honolulu run half-mummies half-maniacs
they brought us to hilo half-dead when
we got there later they shipped us to
honolulu to the sailors home after the
bark had left

  all the data they had was we had been
picked up at sea in a whale-boat which they
hadnt brought along thompson is still
in bad shape he didnt have as much sur-
plus to lose as i did i saw him this
morning hes coming round i told you
they dismissed me the day before yester-
day

  of course i found out the war had ended
while we were on schwarzklippen but i
didnt realize just what that meant i had
dreamed of getting a cruiser to go down
there or a destroyer and seeing steiner
and his crowd rounded up but-the war
is over

  i saw the shipping commissioner here
yesterday a man with the blood and
eyes of a fish he didnt believe me

   its a good varn my man he says
pity you havent any proof of it

   we havent signed peace with ger-
many i told him there are twenty-
three germans waiting to be interned and
punished for raiding

   they may be there and they may be
not he said you say the island is un-
charted its a good place for them
theyra interned all right good morning
if you want to ship i can put you in the way
of a berth

  i went to see the commandant of the
naval yard and i didnt get past the sentry
at the gate

  sending down after them wouldnt get
you back your pearls said manning
even if they took you with them you
couldnt expect them to provide a diver

  i realize that but what about polu
and my kanakas what about the rest of
the crews they sent off in boats the war
is over but they kept me out of it-
no mans island

ii

them and they still stand between me and
the pearls

   not to mention tiburi put in man-
ning

   those are the risks i told you of i
made one more trial this morning there
is a man here named butler he is a
factor supplies the plantations with every-
thing they need and he has other big
interests i met him in tahiti put him
up at the club and entertained him if i
ever came to honolulu he was going to
reciprocate you know the usual thing

   when i got in to him by sending in my
 name i saw he put me down for a fake
 twenty-five pounds lost and these clothes
 robbed me of any resemblance to hooper of
 huapai he told me frankly he didnt
 believe i was the same man to him i was
 just a beach-comber i didnt give any-
 thing away beyond the fact that i could
 make it worth his while to outfit me to an
 island that wasnt charted i didnt even
 mention the german end of it

   he cut me short

    if its a mysterious island with buried
 treasure or a stranded galleon or a won-
 derful pearl lagoon he said im not
 biting

  and then he mentioned the cocos
island fake he started to put his hand
in his pocket but he didnt take it out
when i began to eye him i fancy he
thought for the first time i might be
hooper of huapai after all but i was down
and out and he was not dealing with dere-
licts

   you didnt mention the position of the
 island to any one

  i didnt get a chance you are the
only one who knows the whole yarn man-
ning its up to you its -wild enough
but its true every word of it

   manning stretched out his hand to the
other above the map

   i believe it he said what do you
 want to do

ill

 fong looked in upon the conference
 of two his moon face at the full
 clear shining with the information
 he divulged that he had won slixty dolla
 at chinese lottely manning looked at the
 clock

   it was a quarter after three for hours

 they had talked and planned hooper going
 over his narrative to the smallest details at
 the divers request as fong entered
 hooper was telling where the pearls were
 hidden

  they had locked thompson and me in
the traderoom after the crew got in the
boats and started steiner went to the
raider for further orders concerning us i
suppose perchance to confirm his own plan
of keeping thompson and me aboard the
schooner they hadnt searched us as yet
but i was taking no chances of their over-
looking that and i got busy with
thompson

  there was tobacco on the traderoom
shelves package stuff in leadfoil and we
stripped a lot of that off and put the tobacco
in an empty tin there were crackers in
waxed paper inside their cartons and we
took the paper and left the crackers one
of my best-bet trading-gifts had been rubber
hot-water bottles there is a lot of tooth-
ache and bellyache in the islands and once i
had introduced a chief to the comfort of a
hot-water bag they were all crazy for them
there were two or three of these along

  i made up the pearls in long slim pack-
ages that would gp down the neck of the
bag and i wrapped them first in waxed
paper and then in leadfoil i screwed
down the metal stopper hard and fast and
thompson sealed it up with sounding-wax
while i got his kit of tools and went to
work on the floor

  the hull ran under the traderoom which
was amidships there was a hatch used
mostly for ventilation and i lifted this
it was framed for the width of the trade-
room floor and the space between that and
the hull ceiling where it had been furred
down between the beams that was the
risky part for i was afraid some one would
rubber through the skylight at us thomp-
son kept a lookout and they didnt think
of it

  so i carefully pried out one side of the
frame and knocked out the furring till i
could reach in to a transverse beam
thompson while he watched took his oil-
skin that hung in the room and ripped the
seams he wrapped up the rubber bag in
the back and then pulled the two sleeves
over that making a package of it i muffled
my hammer-head in my handkerchief and
spiked that package to the transverse
beam replaced the frame and chucked the


adventure

rest of the oilskin out of the port then
my empty belt ten minutes later steiner
came in with two men and went through us
and the traderoom they took everything
of value we had including all papers
they took the stores away steiner lifted
the hatch and peered into the hold they
fastened the ports and then uhe skylight
and went away again 

   the pearls are safe manning those
transverse beams wont rot even under
water for fifty years they are selected
oak the rubber might rot a bit but it will
hang together in the oilskin package and the
foil and wax paper will preserve the pearls
even if they dull a trifle we can bring back
the full lusterjby contact with a healthy
body or at the worst they can be skinned
and their price is going up all the time

  the upper deck blew up a bit under
air-pressure when she went down but the
traderoom floor is in place they are
safe and waiting for us

  good

  manning picked up a sheet of paper on
which he had made some memoranda and
read it over

  ill attend to the money end of it first
thing in the morning he said or i
should say later this morning while you
see thompson and refit yourself a bit
then well go after the ship the stores and
the crew

  it isnt going to be easy to find ship or
men im afraid said hooper but we
may have luck you fong and your three
men will be practically passengers ill
try and land a mate to share watch and
work with me on the navigation end
eight sailormen if we can scare up that
many will be enough with thompson
that brings the crew to sixteen id like to
get a few more men who would be good in a
scrap theres tiburi and there are steiner
and his crowd they dont know the wars
over and they may show fight they
would probably try to capture us and take
over our ship they wouldnt be apt to let
us dive peaceably steiner is smart enough
to figure that we were after something
worth while

  you said there were twenty-three of
them said manning half of them
armed

  seven rifles and five automatics in the
bunch steiner has two of the pistols
himself

  hooper began to laugh silently at first
then in a hearty peal

  whats the joke asked manning

  im thinking of steiner interned or
marooned whichever you please knowing
nothing of what has happened he may
figure the war is over by this time but hell
figure it his way that germany owns the
earth and is putting a fence around it im
laughing at the thought of his face when the
news sinks in manning im going to get
hold of a bunch of newspapers back num-
bers ijl pick the ones thatll rub it in
and ill see he gets them first thing after
we arrive it may stop a nasty fight
they may kamerad it though i doubt it
but i want to watch steiner reading those
papers itll be funny now lets turn in
they were both down-town at eight
oclock hooper visiting his sick supercargo
whose convalescence took an immediate
upward trend at the news and then re-
habilitating himself at the fort street
stores with money advanced by manning
when the latter met him close to noon he
saw a different hooper in the tall lean man
straight as a plumb-line striding briskly in a
suit of stiff pongee silk and a panama he
was still the sailor but now he was eminently
the commander

  hooper of huapai all right com-
mented manning to himself ill warrant
butler would have listened to him if he had
gone to him in those duds and the sentry
would have passed him their loss is my
gain

  what luck hooper hailed him

  men are scarce but youll be better able
to handle that than i can but i doubt if
well be able to pick our crew i cabled
my bank in san francisco the money
will be here by noon and ive got word of
a schooner of course im no judge of
what will suit us but it seems the only one
available if we can charter it i have let
slip a hint that we are on the track of v
guano island i thought it might be as wel
not to be too secret questions are bound
to be asked we can be mysterious about
it and let it appear that we are trying to
cover up the leak

  good said hooper tell me about
the schooner

  its the mary l was a pleasure craft
well fitted about ninety tons belonged
to a man who was killed in the war his
widow has no use for it one or two have
no mans island



spoken about buying it for island yachting
but it is too big for most of them it has an
auxiliary engine and a wireless

  fine we dont need the wireless but
we do the engine talk price

  im to see the owner this afternoon
but perhaps youll do that

  not me you do tiie negotiations ill
look over the mary l sounds pretty good
we evidently cant afford to be fussy

  the mary l suited hooper she was
pretty luxuriously fitted up aft but she was
roomy and she had good lines for speed

  if theyll let us put up a temporary
partition in the main cabin to give us some
privacy aft he told manning shell suit
first rate if they dont want a fortune for
the charter

  they want three thousand dollars for
six months answered manning they
wont take less money or shorten the time
of the charter and i shall have to put up
a bond for seven thousand more in case we
dont bring her back

  hooper whistled

  the lady is some financier he said
not that the charter price is so much but
she seems business-like

  she talked with her business adviser
over the phone before shedgive me an
answer her brother-in-law i can man-
age the bond easily by putting up some
california real estate as security i talked
with the man myself who do you sup-
pose it is

  who

  your friend butler

  hooper whistled again

  theres an element of humor in that
he said more than one element i
suppose he doesnt know im in on the deal
but he may guess and hes bound to find
out the main joke is that butler owns a
fertilizer-mill he supplies the plantations
with fertilizer and if he gets wind of the
guano yam you started hell be wild
wouldnt wonder if he tried to horn in
after all

  the joke is on him at all events
said manning then ill get in touch
with him and well start cabling about the
security we may have to wait till the
deeds arrive on the next steamer

  thats all right the schooner has
got to go on the marine railroad shes
foul it will take several days to outfit
and get the crew together ill start

thompson on the provisioning end in a
couple of days hes well enough now to
make out lists see if you can get permis-
sion to start cleaning the schooner right
away they cant lose on that if the
charter money is put up they ought not
to kick and ill scout for men

men came slowly though they
offered big wages two hooper prac-
tically shanghaied from a ship in the
harbor others dribbled in few of them
could have been described as able seamen
but hooper saw promise enough in them for
him to sign them sometimes a good man
showed after an indifferent one had been
taken but the partners decided that an extra
man or so would do no harm

  they were a mixed-pickle lot the sailors
american english finn swede dutch
negro and kanakas fong supplied an
engineer for the kicker engine that was
capable of eight knots and meant much in
crossing windless patches of sea on both
sides of the equator and bucking currents
the engineer was also chinese a man who
had run into tong trouble and was glad to
get away his name was ling and fong
guaranteed him which was enough for
manning who knew a good deal about
engines himself

  but with the bond provided for the mary
l off the marine railroad outfitted ready to
start they were still short of their comple-
ment they had almost decided to sail
short-handed when the man named edwards
appeared upon the scene hooper and
manning were aboard the schooner now
moored to the lading-wharf thompson
was supervising stowage and the mate that
hooper had turned up was having the
standing rigging overhauled

  this mate andersen had had a row
with his skipper and he was a lush when
he could get hold of liquor but the mary
l was to be a prohibition ship and the man
was a good sailor who could handle men and
work out a reckoning

  the partners stood in the bows talking
when edwards boarded spoke to andersen
and then made his way forward cap in
hand deferential capable - looking he
addressed himself to hooper who was now
in skippers serge brass-buttoned peak-
capped

  i understand you are looking for men
sir he began


adventure

  well manning surveyed the appli-
cant approvingly and hooper seemed to
endorse his attitude what capacity
steward for myself sir with willing-
ness to make myself generally useful i
can take my trick at the wheel i can handle
that wireless for you i can wait on table
and i dont mind helping out in the galley
why are you out of a berth

  ive been trying it ashore sir  i have
been head luna on a plantation that is a
head foreman of the bosses of the japanese
cane-gangs it dont suit me i can give
plenty of references sir i was head
steward on the moana one time and i
can turn up a few men for you i have
understood -he lowered his voice- that
you needed them for some sort of guard-
duty i can get you four good men lunas
who have been under me

  it was plain he had heard the guano rumor
that was current and thought that guards
might be left on the island to hold off other
comers the idea struck the partners
favorably the steward was a frank-look-
ing chap glib but that was not out of the
way in his profession neatly dressed they
had not thought of a steward but fong
would have his work cut out in the galley
the four lunas provided an inducement

  when can you turn up these men
asked hooper and what wages do they
want

  ill bring them down tomorrow sir
theyll be off duty theyre fair sick of
handling japs i fancy your wages will
suit

  and whats your name

  edwards williams edwards

  the upshot of it was that the five were
engaged and the complement completed
twenty-one all told

  the start had been originally scheduled
for the early morning flood but a delay in
important stores threatened to put it off
until the afternoon hooper fumed silently
while thompson went up-town to find out
the trouble everything was shipshape
aboard the mary l there was a stiff
breeze blowing outside the harbor when the
halt came hooper paced the wharf im-
patiently with manning	

  its the dynamite he said ive half
a mind to sail without it but its apt to
come in uncommonly useful in more ways
than one im not sure about the opening
in the inner reef for one thing we may

have to blast it but this delays bad for
discipline looks as if we had slipped a
cog in our arrangements we can hardly
get it now unless thompson jimmies his
way into the stre- he might do that
tommys a handy lad when he gets going
but hell have to have it down here inside
of an hour or we lose the tide and we
cant have the crew loafing andersen hasnt
got the initiative of a drowning cat

  he went aboard and manning heard him
issuing orders to which the crew jumped
with feverish energy polishing brass and
coiling down sheets and halyards anew it
was a few minutes after six oclock no
stores or warehouses would open for almost
two hours they would lose the tide yet
he held a faint hope in thompsons ability
to deliver the supercargo had gone off
at boiling-point

  a car came down the water-front and
braked at the wharfhead out of it stepped
butler the factor and manning stared at
him in amazement to see him out at such
an hour evidently with business on the
mary l for a moment he wondered if
anything had turned up against them
butler was not the sort of gentleman to
turn out at dawn merely to say good-by
to the men who had chartered his sister-in-
laws schooner yacht he might have begun
to change his mind about hooper but
manning did not think butler the sort to
make an apology

   the object of the visit flashed in his mind
suddenly butler had heard about the
guano he either wanted to get into part-
nership at the last moment or more likely
get an option on their supposed prospect
manning chuckled silently as butler ap-
proached him with an evident pose of try-
ing to appear as if an early-morning trip
to the water-front was his usual appetizer
hooper had gone below

  good morning going out on this tide
i happened to hear that you were expected
to clear this morning i see you have left
the wireless added butler looking up to
where the delicate aerials stretched between
the fore and main

  yes it was specified in the contract
that nothing was to be dismantled if you
remember said manning dryly

   was it i just glanced through it well
it doesnt interfere wanted to wish you
good luck

   good of you to turn out for that
no mans island



  manning did not bother to cover up the
sarcasm he felt with the deal closed he
had scant use for the factor remembering
how he had treated hooper and just then
hooper came on deck and to the gang-
plank staring at butler with cold eyes but
not halting his stride toward manning

  my partner captain hooper mr but-
ler captain thomas hooper of huapai
hooper nodded curtly but butler was too
clever a business man to show confusion

  i met captain hooper some days ago
he said and i have met him before but
i didnt recognize him and i told him so
rather bluntly you cant blame me
hooper he went on with a show of frank-
ness that if it was insincere was admirably
acted im sorry but you looked like
anything but the man i met at tahiti
if there is anything i can do now

  i dont think so returned hooper
thank you just the same i did look like
a derelict in a way i was the two
measured glances

  look here you two said butler i
understand youre after guano youve
tried to keep it dark naturally but i picked
it up if you land what youre after come
and see me ill talk business with you and
ill see if i cant treat you better this time
hooper i can make it an object if you
want capital to develop or will sell out-
right give me the first chance im in-
terested in fertilizer two ways making it
and selling it we need the urates oxalates
and phosphates in the stuff bring me
samples and an idea of the depth of the
deposits and maybe i can make my peace
with you for the interview we had the other
morning im sorry for that

- manning left the talking to hooper it
was his affair there was no hint of a
twinkle in hoopers eyes as he answered

  if we find anything good in that line
ill come to see you butler be said

fine nothing else i can do for you
i think not a figure came hurrying
down the wharf it was thompson his
face scarlet with mortification and anger

  nothing doing he exclaimed the
stuffs there marked and ready but it got
left over last night found the watchman
but he wouldnt loosen butler and com-
pany have got a fine system i dont
think

  coming from butlers was it thomp-
son

  yes only place in town we could get
the stuff

  well this is mr butler there was a
twinkle in hoopers eyes now were held
up on this tide by some boxes your ware-
house failed to deliver mr butler wonder
if you could help us out he looked to-
ward the car they are fneither big nor
heavy

  of course said the factor promptly
let your man come up with me and point
them out ill bring them down myself
glad to oblige

  he turned to manning as thompson
went off with butler

  ill bet you an even hundred butler
doesnt come down with the dynamite he
offered

  manning laughed and shook his head
he may not even risk his car but i
think hell do that much he seems to
want that guano badly and hell imagine
dynamite will be used for blasting to de-
termine the depths of deposit i wish he
had to imng by his feet till we showed him
the samples

  you dont like him

  no hes a cutthroat in business
  there are others

sin fifteen minutes the car
which had gone off at high speed
came back gingerly on to the wharf
thompson alone in the tonneau with the
boxes of explosive

  butler had an appointment up-town
he said there was a trace of a grin on the
face of butlers driver

  hustle them aboard tommy well
make the tide after all

  edwards had been standing by the rail
he touched his stewards cap as hooper
and manning went aboard

  how soon will you have breakfast sir
he askpd he had already served them hot
coffee

  soon as we clear the bell-buoy make
it half an hour

  very good sir

  capable man that hooper said to
manning

  yes gets on well with the crew got
a vein of good humor thats catching but
fong dont like him

  no too nosey about the galley per-
haps whats fongs verdict

 too-slick
i

adventure

  they laughed as they watched the care-
ful stowage of the dynamite

  the men are going to wonder about
that manning went on are you going
to let them stick to the guano idea
might as well for the present all ready
tommy all right mr andersen
ordered bustle took place the spring
cables were cast off the canvas hoisted and
the mary l heeling to the wind a little
started to slide down-channel with the
breeze aft gathering way sailing past the
channel lighthouse with a fine burst of
speed the keeper waved them a friendly
greeting

  she can walk said hooper good
lines to her easy entry and a sweet run
but im glad shes got an engine aboard
for all that

  once about the bell-buoy the partners
went down to breakfast the partition
that had been put up in the overlarge main
cabin gave them privacy there was a
door in it through which edwards served
their meal from the midships galley ander-
sen who ate at their table had the deck

  the course to schwarzklippen is almost
due southeast said hooper ive set it
soueast by east to clear kauna point thats
the southwest cape on hawaii once round
the bib island and well start on our best
point of sailing a long long reach with a
short leg now and then to fetch up leeway
and well go kiting the mary lll do
better than twelve

  he spoke with enthusiasm and manning
shared it they were off at last and all
obstacles seemed cleared until they reached
the island the little turn with butler had
furnished a happy touch each had an after
stateroom to himself the spare room
was occupied in mannings quarters by his
diving-suits which he had to overhaul and
which he kept under hispwn eyes when at
sea

  the rest of his apparatus was stowed for-
ward hooper had the rifles and automatic
pistols with their ammunition stowed in his
spare berth and under it the crews quar-
ters were a bit cramped but the weather was
fair and they would spend most of their
time on deck the one problem that seemed
to vex hooper was to find occupation for the
men who had shipped as guards they
were a roughish lot but they seemed fit

  i dont like idleness it brews too much
loose talk he said your men are dif-

ferent manning but those chaps are prac-
tically passengers ill have to keep them
busy one thing will be target practise
i want to see how they can shoot we may
be able to pacify tiburi the news of the
papers i brought along may change the
attitude of steiner but it is as well to be
prepared

  he said this while edwards was in the
galley ultimately they would have to
mention the pearls as a valuable package be-
longing to hooper that was to be salved from
a wreck it seemed likely the men might
anticipate trouble with natives on the sup-
posed guano island there had been talk
of it already and neither hooper nor manning
had contradicted it the ex-lunas did not
seem afraid of the prospect

  you said you fancied that you were the
first white men who had touched on the
island said manning

  pretty sure of it

  then id surely be the first diver
  yes why

  im not quite ready to tell you but
ive got a scheme browsing round inside
my head said manning something in
connection with tiburi

  hooper nodded he was getting used
to mannings slow but sure methods

  coming on deck he asked as he pushed
back his coffee-cup and they went up
together

  the northeast trade blew strong and
steady and they sailed fast all day at
nightfall molokai was well behind abeam
of them were lanai and kahoolawe with
the loom of mauis ten-thousand-foot dead
crater back of them manning and hooper
paced the afterdeck together the latter in
charge of the deck until midnight

  behind the great mountain there showed
the shimmer of the rising moon the sky
was bright studded with stars the southern
cross just above the horizon to lift higher
for every night of their voyage the
schooner went easily shouldering through
the seas the wind abaft the beam sheets
well in with the boom ends to the leeward
rail topsails set

  hooper was not satisfied however the
man at the wheel did not suit him

 a good helmsman has the thing by
instinct he said to manning this chap
sails by the card and he hasnt got the feel
of her he wants to keep her full and shes
making too much leeway ill have to try
no mans island



 them all out but i dont believe weve got a
 first-class steersman aboard barring ander-
 sen and i dont want a mate taking a trick
 were losing time with that sort of chap
 no good talking to him either

 the moon like a disk of illuminated
 pearl topped the fire-blasted peaks of
 haleakala poised there as if for flight and
 then soared upward manning watched
 the glory of it as hooper turned toward the
 taffrail impatient at the helmsman down
 in the cabin a clock chimed six bells a
 sailor came aft and reported

 make it six bells said hooper and
 walked to the ships bell forward of the
 main companion and struck the time

 edwards appeared from below and stood
 waiting manning noted the weatherwise
 way in which the steward cocked art eye at
 the topsails then the wake hooper came
 aft again

 	would you like coffee served on deck
 sir

 none for me i want to sleep when i
 turn in how about you manning

 youd have to put laudanum in it to
 keep me awake but i dont want any
 thank you edwards

 the steward lingered

 if youd like me to take a trick at the
  wheel sir he said i think i could get a
 little more out of her

 you do eh hooper eyed him sharply
 not tonight youve been on your feet
 all day but if you can handle the spokes
 i may use you if it doesnt interefere with
 your other work

 yes sir thank you sir replied
 edwards incuriously and went below

 i wouldnt wonder if he could steer
 said hooper hes a capable chap

 too-slick quoted manning

 hooper laughed looking aft he sud-
 denly left manning and went to the com-
 panionway where the night-glasses hung on
 a hook at the head of the stairs

 see that sail back there he asked his
 partner as he hooded the lenses and focused
 them

 manning saw something that looked like

 a silver of pearl far astern

 been trailing us all day- overhauling

 us too shes got the legs of us

 what is your idea

 manning fancied that hooper did not

 like the prospect the skipper stood with

 his legs apart balanced to the pitch and

 

steady heave of the deck as the schooner
lunged through the seas

 think they are following us on purpose
cant say some one might think they
could hang on to us with a iaster craft until
we head up for the guano island and thn
beat us to it for possession and nine points
of the law ten points in such a game
you mean butler

  i dont really mean any one just an
idea well know before long but im
off butler i saw a bit of the real man in
his office that morning he wants guano it
seems better than gold-mining these days
he might be playing both ends to the middle
grab it off if he can or arrange for an option
from us if he cant do any better

  only there isnt any guano

  true enough but i dont like it

iv

hooper had the morning watch
splitting deck duty with andersen
in default of a second mate when
manning came on deck at seven he found
the skipper watching the trailing vessel of
the night before she had gained con-
siderably in the night hooper handed
manning the glasses just as the pursuer
if that was her purpose came about and
tacked across the stern of the mary l
about half a mile away

  through the powerful lenses manning got
a fine view of her a schooner with a black
hull pointing high into the wind and cream-
ing through the crisp waves sheets well in
for the tack canvas unwrinkled-a beauti-
ful sight brass twinkled here and there
on her decks working up she tacked
again the crew tailing on to the sheets with
yachtsman-like precision she did not falter
in the eye of the wind but swung to her
course and came charging down after the
mary l to leeward now but eating up the
distance

  smart ship and smartly handled said
hooper see how she came about no
fuss with her headsails

  looks like a private craft suggested
manning a yacht she may be racing
with us for the fun of it

  soon find that out she can go ahead
allshe wants to though i hate to be passed
at that rate if i had the moanamanu id
show her a thing or two but ill be glad
when she gets off our horizon she isnt
i

adventure

a yacht for all her brass her rigging is too
business-like and her canvas too heavy look
at her come

  the stranger sailing a parallel course
forging up abeam carried a private signal
at her gaff and a triangle of flag at her peak
this last showed plainly a white star in a
blue circle on a scarlet ground

  shes a yacht after all said manning
thats the flag of the hawaii yacht club
ive seen it too many times at pearl harbor
to be mistaken

  hooper shook his head

  shes not a yacht names seamew
he read off through the glasses but she
may be harmless shes dipping her flag
he turned and shouted an order to return
the salute the seamew tacked again as
if satisfied to have displayed her speed and
not wishing to humiliate the mary l by
crossing her bows

  sporting said hooper

  breakfast is ready sir

  edwards stood there with eyes that
watched the seamew he had a faculty of
appearing suddenly without noise a stew-
ards attribute that to manning always was
a trifle uncanny and annoying with him
was andersen ready to take over the deck

  know anything of that boat edwards
the senmew asked hooper

  yes sir know her well ive been
aboard her sir a fast one belongs to
mr huddersleigh of fanning island on
her way home mr huddersleigh makes
regular trips to honolulu every few months
sir i knew she was in the harbor sir but
she was over toward iwilei you might
not have noticed her sir

  ah

  hoopers exclamation held relief in which
manning shared there was no especial
risk in any one trailing them down to
schwarzklippen but neither fancied the
espionage

  ive heard of huddersleigh said man-
ning king of fanning island exports
shagreen mostly for pocketbooks and
polishing until lately now sharkskin has
gone up theyre using it for boots-

  hell be on the same course as we are
till we hit the line said hooper at break-
fast decent of him not to show us up too
much gad that chap can make four-
teen knots on his best point of sailing
sail rings round us on any wind doubt
if we see much of him after today

  but they did hooper discovered un-
expected talent in steering in two of the
sailors one of the hawaiians and the finn
the mary l developed latent speed as the
skipper found out her best points the
seamew had a good start of them but on
the third day they picked her up again
hull down and from then on kept inter-
mittent company in lighter winds the
mary l had the better of it- the men
scented a race and entered into the spirit
of it as hooper set a big fishermans stay-
sail between main and fore and the mary l
showed what she was really capable of

  he massed the men and crew at the rail
and shifted them about to preserve the
center of effort and what with varying airs
and hoopers skill matters evened up

  keeps the loafers doing something he
remarked to manning plenty of time for
target practise later on

  ten degrees north of the equator the
breeze began to falter and threaten to fail
altogether fongs compatriot had over-
hauled the engine and hooper prepared to
abandon canvas for gasoline

  we can take our time about coming
back he said weve got plenty of
gas and we can strike a dead course for
schwarzklippen well bid good-by to the
seamew now shes due to change her
course for fanning anyway

  at noon that day the wind blew out alto-
gether and they started up the engine the
seamew lay a mile away rolling in the calm
hooper dipped his ensign in farewell salute
and the fannings island boat answered
then they saw her canvas coming down
smartly smothered and reefed through the
glasses a white wake showed at her stem
as she swung off and took course approxi-
mately south-southwest

  shes got a kicker too said hooper
well thats the last of her

  on divergent courses the two schooners
were soon out of sight of each other the
mary l as thompson put it commenced
to taxi across the fine for her destination
at the evening meal fong himself appeared
to serve the after cabin

  where is edwards asked mansiing
that steward all time this aftenoon
foolee too much with ling along that engine
along that dynamo said fong in hid sing-
song pidgin-english he say he fixee
wiless

  hooper frowned
no mans island

  has he been interfering with ling he
asked

  fung shrugged his shoulders

  too - slick he said just as ed-
wards entered

  i have been testing the wireless sir
thought you might like to use it

  what for

  i thought it best to have it in readiness
sir so i overhauled it i told you i could
handle it when i joined sir and as you said
nothing to the contrary i assumed it was
a part of my duties i waited for the engine
to be started regularly

  well not need it is it in shape

  i believe so sir i have no means of
knowing whether my test sending was re-
ceived of course it would not mean any-
thing and i have not picked up any mes-
sage hardly likely to in these latitudes
but i think i can say it is in shape sir we
might intercept some news once in a while
if we had a regular operator

  he had taken overplus duties from fong
who left a plain impression on his exit that
he did not think much of the energetic
edwards

  but the opinions of fong and ling
naturally a unit were not shared by the
others aboard it began to get almost un-
bearably hot in the windless spaces what
breeze the schooner herself furnished as
she forged steadily ahead averaging a hun-
dred and sixty miles a day seemed to come
out of an oven the putty wrinkled and
crumbled in the seams the brass was
blistering and general lassitude held all
hands by day enhanced by the fact that
there was little to do but as soon as thq
sun dropped blazing into the sea and some
relief came with night edwards organized
entertainment

  he got together a quartet and he told
tales that created breathless interest broken
by peals of laughter from the groups that
surrounded him on deck smoking through
the long hours when sleep was hard to coax

  prickly heat and loss of appetite all the 
conditions that make for peevishness under
such circumstances were nullified by the
ubiquitous steward he seemed to have
the capacity for making a personal friend
out of every one aboard saving the china-
men often the afterguard manning
hooper andersen and thompson regretted
the dignity of office that forbade them
joining in the after-dark amusement sessions

  by day target practise went on with 
an hour set apart for it several of the
men bid fair to become good shots others
proved hopeless and hooper weeded them
out as wasters of cartridges the four
ex-lunas andjedwards himself were evident-
ly familiar with the use of firearms man-
nings steady nerves brought him to the
forefront and hooper was already an ex-
cellent marksman with either pistol or
rifle two of mannings assistants also
shaped well

  the target practise began to invest the
expedition with an earnestness of purpose
that brought about more or less talk much
of it in a jesting strain of the duties that
they might have to perform the general
opinion among the crew prevailed that
they would have trouble with the natives
on landing and that some of them might
be left as an armed guard against them or
other interference if the guano-deposits
proved satisfactory for exploitation this
impression hooper and manning allowed
to stand for the present manning over-
hauled his diving-suits and that diversified
the talk and provided fresh speculation

there was a change in the two
leaders as they steadily neared
schwarzklippen manning seldom
over talkative grew taciturn and hooper
began to flame with an eagerness that mani-
fested itself in his eyes in his nervous pacing
of the deck working out the daily position
his scanning of the horizon that he knew
must as yet yield no results the entire
man emanated force and at times manning
patching the rubber of his diving-dress
would think of him as a racing engine
constantly evolving unapplied power

  when they reached the borders of the
south equatorial current a hundred and
fifty miles south of the line the southwest
trade began to blow with increasing steadi-
ness and soon they were able to shut off
the engine and forge ahead with increased
speed under canvas hooper came below
one npon to work his reckoning his eyes
gleaming

  he and andersen compared and agreed
and hooper took out his chart and dividers

  we should lift schwarzklippen by dawn
tomorrow manning he said with a tri-
umphant note

  the news spread about the schooner and
all that afternoon watch on deck and watch


adventure

below with the idlers gathered in groups
and looked eagerly ahead hours before
there was any possibility of sighting land
meanwhile there was oiling of weapons and
a growing alertness in word and action

  with the exception of fong and ling
every soul aboard was on deck at the com-
mencement of the morning watch one
of the hawaiians was perched in the fore-
mast spreaders before the sun leaped up
and day suddenly blazed over the sea and
sky the wind strengthened with the dawn
blowing well aft of the beam and the
schooner surged along at a fast clip through
curling sharply faceted waves of sapphire
dazzling where they caught the sun

  flying fish soared out of the sea pursued
by dolphins that leaped after them two
bells came and then three and four fong
brought up steaming coffee for the men and
edwards served the afterguard

  as the last stroke of five bells sounded
the deep voice of the hawaiian came float-
ing down and back from the fore

  land-ho

  they strained forward into the bows
and the port rail gazing to where the look-
out pointed a few degrees aport hooper
handed the glasses to manning and sprang
to the mainmast going up it like a cat
barefooted as he had come on deck his
toes clinging to the rings clasping the
halyards

  a purple speck showed on the horizons
rim and gradually lifted from the sea grim
desolate uncharted a cheer went up
breakfast was forgotten fore and aft as they
crowded to the rail aside from manning
and hooper it meant little to them ma-
terially they were not in the true secret
of the voyage but no one can sail for
leagues across the ocean stretches where
there is no plume of smoke gleam of sail
or promise of land and raise an island un-
placed upon the maps without sharing the
thrill of the discoverer

  landfall in such circumstances ever
partakes somewhat of the miracle it heats
the blood and rouses the spirit of adventure
there were risks ahead they knew fighting
against odds with savages where the penal-
ty of defeat meant cruel death and horrid
burial and the ships company faced it
with an eagerness that brought a nod of
approval from hooper as he slid down the
halyards and regained the deck

  he glanced at manning triumphantly

as if he had vindicated his story justified
the divers investment but manning only
nodded back and put out his great powerful
hand to grip the others nervous fingers

  congratulations are almost in order
said hooper we can make a landing this
afternoon if theyll let us well land any-
way he added his lips tightening i
must overhaul that budget of newspapers
for steiner

  from his seniority of some ten years
manning smiled a little tolerantly at hooper
as the skipper dived below there was a
good deal of the boy in hoopers virile man-
hood he thought and then a burst of youth
welled up in him and this time he laughed
aloud so that andersen looked at him in
wonder

  for the goddess adventure who reckons
time and the calendar and birthdays as a
joke as long as a mans heart beats sturdily
and he is able to stand on his hind legs
had taken manning by the hand like a
fairy godmother and he was young again
his blood tingled to his fingertips and he
felt the glow of danger and achievement
for the first time too the pearls in the
lagoon took on material value material
prospects hooper had said that they
should be fully worth three hundred thou-
sand dollars in the present market and a
third of that was to be mannings own

  with a score of years of hard work under-
sea much of it dull and laboriously wearing
he had had thoughts of retiring somewhere
near the sea with fong as factotum to sail
a sloop to dig in a garden and grow roses
something like that now fresh vistas
opened the world was wide and he was
in the full strength of his prime

  a thought came to him and he followed
hooper

  what about letting the crew in a little
deeper on this thing he asked telling
them about steiner and his men at all
events the war is over but steiner doesnt
know it and i take it he wont be waiting
on the beach for you to deliver him those
papers he wont be in any too good a
humor after he reads them and i suppose
theyll be sighting us soon maybe making
smoke from that signal-fire you spoke of
and just exactly what are yu intending
to do with our germans when we bag them
peaceably or otherwise

  march them in to that commandant
at honolulu said hooper right past
no mans island



that coclef sentry who challenged me for
a tramp it will be up to him to extradite
em or otherwise dispose of them the end-
ing of the war evens me up with steiner
personally- his conceitll shrivel like a
kids balloon when its pricked though
there have been times when i had other
ideas of handling him but ill get the
men aft and talk to them

  his speech was short and to the
point

  there is no guano to speak of on that
island men he said my schooner was
taken by a german raider and i and mr
thompson kept prisoners aboard of it under
a german crew later one of our own
cruisers chased us and we were wrecked in
a storm on the island the schooner lies
in ten fathoms in the lagoon just beyond
an inner reef there are belongings of
mine hidden in her that mr manning and
his men will dive for that is what we
came after the germans are still there
they dont know the war is over

  there was a guffaw from the men

  i got away in a whale-boat with mr
thompson we were picked up at sea and
brought to honolulu there are natives
on the island who are a melanesian tribe
not friendly to whites we may have to
pacify them that is why i have brought
you along with arms the germans may
need some explaining to before they accept
the situation we shall have toact as cir-
cumstances guide us if we succeed in
getting back my valuables there will be a
bonus paid to every man aboard of two
hundred and fifty dollars over and above
his wages mr manning and i being partners
in this trip

  he looked toward manning who con-
firmed the bonus with a nod the men
cheered led by edwards

  we shall try and treat with steiner
leader of the germans and tell him where
germany now stands continued hooper
we shall try and treatwith tiburi chief
of the tribe we do not wish to start
bloodshed if we can avoid it you have
been prepared for a certain amount of
trouble but any landing-parties in-the
face of danger will be made up of volun-
teers

  edwards led another salvo of cheering
and one of the men he had furnished stepped
forward

  these aint any of our crowd goin to

back down skipper he said not for
heines nor for cannibals

  i thought not said hooper that is
all

  he turned to manning as the men filed
forward talking it over

  good spirit there he said they took
it all easily enough

  didnt even seem to be surprized com-
mented manning but theyll do a lot
of jawing about the nature of your valuables
from now on that bonus was a good idea
it cuts into the pile considerably and
well have to sell some of the pearls to raise
it but it seems only fair to give them some
sort of a share in the deal

  fair enough you might offer to sell
some of the pearls to butler instead of
guano said manning with a laugh

the island grew showing the
crater but hiding the green cone
back of it frowning from the sea
it fitted the name that steiner had given
it it looked like a barren volcano water-
less incapable of providing for life yet the
heart of it was thick with vegetation hooper
promised no smoke of signal-fire showed
and as they came closer hooper trained
his glass upon the upper cliffs with a frown

  funny he muttered theres no flag
and the staff has gone

  might have been blown down said
manning

  fancy theyd have set it up again i
dont quite like the look of it they may
have smelled a mouse when they sighted us
if they thought i had got clear-but then
they would have expected a cruiser rather
than a schooner

  they may have got heart after you
started and built some sort of a raft or
craft

  possible but i dont believe it they
were getting too soft life suited them
no sir dont think they had the guts to
tackle that things were too easy but i
dont like it

  can we see their camp sailing past the
open end of the crater or are you going to
go through the reef into the lagoon

  we couldnt see it plainly enough to be
sure and i dont care to risk that second
reef-opening i told you i thought it would
have to be blasted its too narrow be-
tween the reefs for much maneuvering
cant tackle it on the ebb anyhow my


adventure

idea is to get in touch with tiburi if we
can keep the fear of the white man in his
heart he wont bother us after some gifts
the promise of more and good care on our
part to cover ourselves well head up a
bit and sail round

  the course was slightly shifted and they
coasted the black sheer cliffs of the volcanic
crest fissured and fluted here and there
devoid of all life save the wheeling gulls
that rose and settled and soared out to meet
the schooner screaming at intrusion the
narrow promontory that joined crater to
cone opened up and the sight of the latter
covered with verdure a green jewel rising
from a ring of ivory surf heartened all of
them and lightened the oppression of that
silent grim crater

  still there was no sign of life though they
swept the beach and the outstanding ledges
of the cliffs with glasses no natives
gathered on the sand no canoes put out
to sea no wisp of smoke showed signs of
habitation only the birds wheeling and
wheeling overhead

  looks as if the whole place was deserted
said manning some sort of plague might
have swept them or they may have killed
each other off like kilkenny cats german
against cannibal

  not likely but theres something
wrong returned hooper the natives
would not be frightened into hiding by us
if they were frightened and they are not
that breed of cats they would still be curi-
ous something wrong if they are there
they are not friendly steiner may have
won out and be setting a trap with the idea
of getting hold of the schooner for his get-
away thats the most likely thing

  or might be in league with tiburi
  hooper shook his head

  no tiburi is too sore about that
woman deal steiner kidnaped his daugh-
ter no tiburi might pull some treachery
in a pretended pact but steiner would be too
foxy i- listen

  they were now to the south of the island
and the wind blew from it manning
caught a booming note distinct from the
surf it was followed by another and an-
other at pulsing intervals it was the beat
of a drum and it was punctuated by a
queer moaning sound like the hoot of an
enormous owl

  war-drums said hooper war-drums
and conch shells tiburis out against us

this is not going to be duck soup they
are waiting for us to make a landing then
theyll tackle us from ambush that bush
is full of warriors now waiting for their
chance too many odds not more than
two or three places to land

  whats your plan

  its close to sunset nothing tonight
well tack out and hold council of war
no moon tonight is there

 no why

  then ive got a plan said manning
and i think it will work with tiburi

v

s manning closely surveyed the
shore -line as they coasted about
the cone and headed north again to
complete the circuit of schwarzklippen
the steeply slanting sides were thick with
growth to the summit palms waved above
a tangle of bush growth along the shore-
line mangroves clustered thickly with here
and there little beaches the reef with its
double walls of coral came closer in to the
land than off the crater proper and in places
the two barriers merged as one

  what do you figure the average depth of
that lagoon manning asked hooper who
was watching him frown at the land slowly
darkening as the sun dropped and the
shadow of the crater fell across it could
a whale-boat get through that opening do
you suppose

  he pointed to where the shifting fine of
spray rising from the combers breaking on
the reef seemed a little less in volume
hooper surveyed it critically

  i imagine you could make it at the
flood easily enough why what is your
scheme manning

  you say tiburi was inclined to accept
steiner as a god by this time he has prob-
ably found out that he is not a beneficent
deity if he is one at all to judge by their
present attitude

  he nodded toward the cone now on their
port bow they were in its lee and the
throbbing beat of the war-drums was plainer
than ever

  but i have had considerable experience
with natives as a diver and there is no ques-
tion but what the sight of a diver rising
out of the sea knocks them absolutely
cold-until they see you crawl out of your
armor like a hermit crab from its shell
no mans island



then they know you are only a man but
you are still ace high

  good reason for that said hooper
there isnt a tribe but has its legend-
they all tie up to the same source i imagine
-of magicians who are able to pass from
island to island group to group a diver
would seem like the biggest kind of a wizard
i begin to see your drift but why scare them
stiff we want to get on terms of commu-
nication with tiburi they would hide in
that bush like rabbits and wed never find
them if you walked out on them

  not if i made them believe i was a
friendly god ive thought it out quite a
bit hooper and i believe it will work but
we dont want them to tie it up too closely
with the schooner lets talk it over in
the cabin

  fifteen minutes later mannings three as-
sistants were summoned aft fong being
busy with the evening meal hooper
headed the schooner south into the wind
the sun dropped darkness rushed up save
fr the stars the canvas of the mary l
was taken in and close furled from the
island she could not be picked up by the
sharpest of the thousand eyes that had
peered at her from the jungle and hoped
that the white men might strike the reef
or land unguardedly

  in the cabin manning overhauled his div-
ing-suit and worked over the fixing of some
marine fireworks coston signals and port-
fires used on life-buoys these he made tem-
porarily water-proof thompson arranged
a small box in which he placed gifts that
would be most likely to strike the fancy of
the natives this he carefully wrapped in
thicknesses of tarpaulin hooper busied
himself for a while in thoroughly greasing an
automatic pistol

   i prefer the other suit for general work
said manning as he and one of his men care-
fully inspected and tested the oxygen tank
but it means a lighter of some sort and the
pump nt to mention the pipe and life and
signal lines this leaves me free to go up
on the beach the main thing is to be sure
they see me and there  be no doubt of that
its a big risk just the same manning
said hooper of course well be covering
you but if they did rush you youd be help-
less i mean as to quick action

  not so much as youd think i dont
have to wear gloves i could use my gun
wouldnt take you long to get in to me

besides ive been thinking its about time
for me to take an active part in this busi-
ness here ive been playing passenger
while youve been working ship i want to
earn my share all ive done is to put up
some cash with the practical certainty of
getting fifteen to one for my money

  you are going to do the diving said
hooper his voice warm with approval

  an hour or two of my regular line of
work doesnt amount to shucks well
i guess were ready hooper when you are

  the schooner was well off the island
now it showed as a vague loom against
the stars hooper ordered the engine
started and set the course the sound of
the exhaust would be lost in that of the surf
he calculated when he went below he
found manning stripped and about to put
on a light combination suit of wool long-
legged and long-sleeved hooper gazed ad-
miringly at mannings brawn the diver
weighed close to two hundred pounds but
there was no superfluous flesh only big
bones packed hard with muscle and sinew
that rippled as manning moved like grass
beneath the wind

  he put on the rubber suit and went on
deck his two assistants carrying the
weighted shoes the helmet and the oxygen
tank that was to strap upon his shoulders
thompson carried the box of gifts-gaudy
handkerchiefs small mirrors brass rings
and beads-goods selected by hooper in
honolulu for some such occasion with
tiburi eliminated as an enemy giving them
the news as to steiners present circum-
stances much of their difficulties would be
removed and the more he considered man-
nings plan the more hooper approved of
it and credited the diver with an imagina-
tion that he had not suspected him capable
of he was beginning thoroughly to ap-
preciate his partner

  the mary l chugged up to within a mile
of the reef then crept in closer the cone
showed dark as they came to a point oppo-
site the place where they had first heard the
drums and conch shells the night was
quiet save for the drum-roll of the surf that
showed faintly phosphorescent where it
foamed over the reef the tide was at flood
now it was three bells in  the middle
watch hooper did not doubt but that
there were some of tiburis men awake but
he intended to make certain mannings
rising from the sea was to be spectacular


adventure

  a rocket soared up from the deck and rose
curving to burst high above the cone in a
shower of fiery stars that slowly settled
down another and another followed the
last exploding in an aerial bomb harmless
but startling to the native mind

  a whale-boat was lowered and manning
got into the stern sheets with hooper
besides the crew his three assistants fol-
lowed then thompson rifles were
handed down and the apparatus they
rowed for the reef and then along it look-
ing for the opening manning had pointed
out to hooper they found it without
much difficulty and backed water hooper
had the steering-oar he watched for a
big wave gave command in a low voice and
the stout blades bent as the boat swept
through he reef-gate into the calm lagoon
with the surf behind them they backed
water while one of mannings men sounded
from the bows

  little better than nine fathom he re-
ported

  suddenly there came to them borne from
the land the muffled beat of a drum
echoed repeated tiburi was awake in
the boat they worked quickly but quietly
there was little phosphorus in the lagoon
and they hoped to be unobserved it would
make the appearance of manning more
mysterious if this was the case manning
put on his helmet and his leaded shoes and
an assistant adjusted the former his pistol
was in his belt holster together with a knife
a light ladder was attached to one gunwale
with hooks

the crew edged to the other side to
keep balance slowly ponderous
but not clumsy manning turned
and slowly descended the ladder a few
feet below the surface he halted on the
rungs waiting for the little plop in his ears
that would tell him the eustachian tubes
were open and the pressure adjusted then
he went down the pliant rungs hooper
watching his bulk ringed and streaked with
wreaths of faint luminosity he carried
with him the box of gifts under one arm and
his fireworks were attached to his belt with
slipknots

  three quick tugs came and the cord
slackened as hooper coiled it in man-
ning had reached bottom the rowers
rested on their oars paddling now and then
to offset the current of the flood and main-

tain their position the others held rifles
ready they waited eagerly hardly draw-
ing breath from the dark slopes of the
cone the drums continued to boom now
and then came the harsh hoot of a conch
shell the rockets had thoroughly per-
formed their part in the nights entertain-
ment on the wrinkled surface of the la-
goon the stars were reflected in broken
shifting lights a hundred yards away the
whale-boat was invisible

  the time seemed interminable before the
watcher in the bows gave a slight gasp he
had heard rather than seen something in-
shore suddenly the green flare of two
portfires broke out on the surface well
toward the land the illumination ex-
tended almost to the boat but hooper did
not believe the eyes ashore would focus on
anything but the object that was rising from
the sea wading toward the beach in one
raised hand manning held a red coston sig-
nal that he had tipped with sodium under-
neath a sealed cap now taken off and the
tube of- carmine fire ignited flaked and
sputtered down on his weird figure con-
trasting vividly with the green glare from
the portfires afloat on miniature buoys

  the shining helmet with its goggle eyes
the metal shoulder - pieces increasing his
great breadth the rising sleeknessof the
rubber-clad body streaming with water
that reflected back the contrasting lights
the gleaming widening circles that sur-
rounded him as he stalked on made him
impressive enough to those in the boat to
the natives he must have appeared a veri-
table god or demon of the sea

 drums and conchs ceased suddenly
hooper could almost feel the intensity of
those straining eyes in the bush he could
imagine the dropped jaws and superstitious
consternation as the savages gibbered in
their coverts wondering what this awesome
visitation portended he had no fear now
for mannings safety more for the possi-
bility of overdoing the intended effect

   the coston died down and manning lighted
another he was only waist-deep now ad-
vancing up the shelving floor of the lagoon
the portfires sputtered on steadily the
little beach between the mangroves that
was his objective was blank and it was
sound reasoning that there were no natives
in its immediate vicinity sound also that
every movement of the supernatural visitor
was noticed
no mans island



  manning reached the beach and stood
erect waving his coston then he stooped
and placed the box upon the sand well above
tide-reach from the bush shrill cries of
terror sounded as he straightened up close
by grew young cocopalms and palmetto
scrub he severed two palm-leaves signs
of amity and thrust them on either side of
his gift before he turned and stalked down
the beach into the lagoon once more the
portfires died out as he submerged

   the boat edged in directly in a line for the
beach paddling softly under cover of the
darkness intensified by the going out of the
chemical illuminants hooper hung over
the stern watching in the bows the man
with the lead sounded frequently giving out
his depths in a low voice then hooper
saw something glowing on the bottom like a
submerged star it was an electric torch
carried by manning water-proof of case with
a powerful battery part of his equipment

  back water there men over with the
laddar ordered the skipper

  the weighted rungs shd down the ladder
tautened and shook as manning mounted
with the men seated on the opposite gun-
wale as before to balance his weight he
climbed heavily in and an assistant un-
screwed the helmet and relieved him of its
weight and the leaded boots he took a
seat in the stem as they steered for the
entrance

  how did it go he asked no trouble
in making it fairly smooth bottom

  no question of your making an impres-
sion said hooper you must have
looked like the old man of the sea himself
only hope you didnt overdo it from the
friendship standpoint otherwise you could
set up as a god tomorrow morning and have
no fear of their not obeying you

  so long as i stayed inside my outfit
said manning if i took off my helmet to
eat id descend from my godhood im
afraid my idea was to remain as a hidden
power for the present with the promise of
gifts or the menace of destruction fairly well
balanced and of course in league with
you

  well find out if theyve taken the bait
by morning said hooper

  back on the schooner they sent up two
more rockets as a climax to the program
then they started up the engine once again
shifting to sail when they were well out
all night they tacked off and on and dawn

found them once more off the cone hooper
focused his glasses on the beach it was still
deserted there were no signs of natives 
sea or land but the box of gifts had
vanished

vi

the only thing to do for the
present said hooper is to wait
and see if it works out weve got
our stage set or ready to be set if they
dont come out well have to scare em into
submission an invasion of the cone by
you in your suit and one of your men back-
ing you up from the water in the second
would bring them to time only wed have
to round them up

   theres a canoe coming out of the man-
groves sir said edwards more than
one

  like scary water-beetles one by one
emerging from the mangroves that appar-
ently masked a fresh-water creek or an inlet
the canoes of tiburi made their appearance
it was plain that the chiefs brain had
evolved two things first that the appari-
tion of the water-god was connected with
the coming of the great white mans canoe
the second that had ever appeared in his
realms and the first had come only as a
wreck it was probable that they might
have seen the whale-boat in the lagoon after
all possible that they had made out the
schooner beneath the rising flare of the
rockets

   the second thing was that both god and
the white men were of friendly disposition
instead of demanding sacrifice the god had
deposited gifts some of which were similar
to articles used by steiner and his men
cupidity and curiosity building upon these
factors brought out the tribe timid of a
second appearance of the sea-monster yet
hopeful of more gifts of an alliance with
these rich and powerful strangers

  but they were wary steiner had not
come to them bringing gifts steiner had
stolen their young women steiner had
fought them off with magic sticks that shot
fire and missiles that tore holes through
which life passed out swiftly they carried
their arms spears of hardwood others tipped
with bone and sharks teeth bows and ar-
rows and clubs the canoes bristled with
the display

the mary l headed up into the wind and


adventure

hung there waiting for them some of the
canoes held fifty men sitting two to a
thwart the prows and sterns rose high
were carven and inlaid with shell and orna-
mented with colored streamers in all
there were a full five hundred warriors
first one and then another filed through the
reef opening and spread out in crescent
formation

  you see said hooper this is a tribe
who have never come in contact with white
men everything we do is wonderful we
constantly perform miracles that is why
steiner was able to handle them once he
had shown what his guns could do all the
old tricks can be played in full force and this
is the time to pull them off some of them
at least if steiner sees us in combination
with tiburi hell capitulate without trouble
and well let him read his papers while we
salvage the moanaitianu it begins to look
as if it was all ridiculously simple thanks to
you manning i can talk their dialect and
ill coax em in while you and fong stand
by for your cues

  the foresail was lowered with the top-
sails and jibs and the mary l stood up to
the wind moving slowly under staysail and
mainsail by the port rail a four-sided
screen of canvas had been erected a
ladder hung down into the water

  inside the screen fong dressed in the
suit that manning had worn was con-
cealed mannings other assistants stood
guard by the screen in the cabin was
manning clad in the more elaborate suit
ready to have the helmet adjusted as soon
as the natives had been persuaded to come
aboard he sat on one of the plush settees
of the schooner-yachts furnishings as if on
a throne prepared to receive new subjects

  hooper called to him down the com-
panion

  tiburis in the biggest canoe he said
hes edging in youll have plenty of
time to put on your helmet ill palaver
with them

  all right answered manning

  edwards was with him ready to adjust
the heavy headpiece he felt like the ogre
in a childs play a good-natured ogre
and the natives were only children in intel-
lect apt to be treacherous but about to be
spellbound by majesty as hooper had
said it was all likely to be ridiculously easy
from now on no fighting no bloodshed
he had no enmity toward steiner

  hooper had felt bitter as was only nat-
ural but with the recovery of his pearls as-
sured with the war itself having advanced
prices sufficiently to cover the price of his
schooner even to indemnify largely the cost
of this expedition he was willing to turn
over the germans to the government

  on deck hooper caught up his mega-
phone and called to tiburi by name forty
paddles struck the water in consternation
sending the canoe backward as if it were a
living thing startled by the magnified voice
that hailed them in their own tongue that
knew the name of tiburi

  come without fear tiburi called
hooper we are friendly to you we
would add to the gifts of him who walks
under the water

  tiburi sullen crafty savage that he was
summoned his courage he had to save his
face or lose dignity and the white man
with the great voice spoke of gifts he gave
an order and the canoe stroked forward
again then he stood up by the bows
leaning on the carven prow tall and lean
naked save for a belt and shell-ornaments
his mop of fuzzy hair was orange-colored
his face was smeared with white and scarlet
his pot-belly bloated by fermenting diets
showed in weird contrast to his bony body
who call tiburi by name he asked
gathering confidence as he spoke

  come closer tiburi and see

  by the side of hooper men were display-
ing gaudy cloth holding out hands that
showed gifts of some sort tiburi and his
men could not see just what they were but
they were things the white men brought
therefore precious

  tiburi shouted an order and the rest of
the canoes halted while his own advanced
on the beach other natives were gathering
women with shorn heads children old men
boys tiburi knew the eyes of his tribe
were upon him he would be the first to
board this big canoe he would get the pick
of his gifts and perhaps they might an-
nihilate the white men after all for they
were few and he had half a thousand-he
counted them by sets of ten fingers-ten
times ten times ten

 the god-him who walks under the
water-was not in evidence if they took
the canoe and killed the white men they
would have all the treasure they would
have their skulls perhaps they could do it
before the god interfered he might be
no mans island



sleeping or he might be far off too far off to
come before they had killed and looted and
hidden themselves in the bush

  ail this he thought as he stood by the
prow of his canoe two of the small round
mirrors that had been left on the beach
flashing in the distended lobes of his ears
and then his eyes bulged as he gazed on the
face of the white man with the big voice
hooper had put down the shell through
which he had made his voice thunder
tiburi knew that trick himself

  but this man he was-he was- surely
this was the white man who had been a slave
to steiner who had escaped with the other
white slave in the boat-over whose escape
steiner had gone nearly crazy cursing and
punishing his companions as tiburi had
been informed by the natives who had left
him for steiner but had fled back to him
again claiming that steiner had blamed and
beaten them for the escape of the slaves and
the loss of the boat and here was the other
slave beside him

  i see you know me tiburi said
hooper me and my friend we have
come back again rescued by him who
walks under the water and we bring
gifts for tiburi who is also the enemy of
steiner come and receive them

  a crafty look came into the chiefs eyes
that hooper could not interpret he became
plainly confident he swaggered

  i am your friend white man he an-
swered as i am the enemy of him who
was your enemy i will come aboard

  the canoe came alongside hooper warned
the savages before they could all leap for
the rail their eyes goggling at the lengths
of cloth the beads and brass rings they now
saw plainly

  ten men only he said holding up the
fingers of both hands

  tiburi and his followers saw the ready
rifles and knew what they could do ti-
buri gave his orders and the unchosen ones
sullenly subsided pacified somewhat by the
gifts that hooper ordered distributed and
the chief followed by his bodyguard of ten
gained the decks and looked curiously a
little fearfully about them

hooper gave a command and the
crew lowered fore and staysail and
gasketed them tiburi blinked a
a little he glanced over the side to where
his canoes were gracfully edging in against

his orders but he was not displeased
this white man was a fool to lower his sails
true there were the sticks that spat fire
and death but cunning might prevail
and then he frowned as doubt and fear
smote him for the white mans canoe
without sails without paddles was begin-
ning to move yells came from the savages
left in the canoe clinging to the rail being
dragged along with increasing speed yells
came from the flotilla from the shore
tiburis eyes rolled what magic was this

  fear not tiburi said hooper it is
the servants of him who walks under the
water who move us we shall go out a
little way here are gifts

  tiburi his mind jellied fingered the
things offered him without enthusiasm he
did not like the situation it made him feel
powerless but when thompson brought
him a generous measure of gin which he first
sniffed then drank his courage came back
to him with the warmth of his stomach

  and the schooner stopped moving
hooper had started the engine for the
double purpose of demonstration and mov-
ing away from the reef

  does the white man want the other
white men given to him asked tiburi
perhaps can you deliver them

  as he spoke hooper suddenly stepped for-
ward pointing at the necklace of human
teeth that the chief wore he had caught
the glint of gold of gold fillings

  where did you get those he asked
  tiburi strutted

  after you left o white man he said i
tiburi took the other white men captive
they used their fire-sticks but presently
they were worn out fire came from them
no longer and they had stolen my women
and beaten the men they had taken from
me so we took them some of them we
killed their skulls hang in my house
these- he lifted the necklace-i took
from one of them their flesh we did not
eat we fed it to the dogs it was tough
and too salty those we took alive we keep
for our children to look at soon we may
kill them now our women make a mock
of them and they furnish us with amuse-
ment will you buy them from me o
white man with gifts shall i deliver
them alive or dead

  here was an unexpected turn it ex-
plained the missing flagstaff the lack of sig-
nal-smoke steiners ammunition had given


adventure

out and he had been captured hooper felt
a revulsion of pity of the germans they
were white men they must be rescued
and he suddenly saw them caged in the sav-
age village jeered at and tormented kept
as white children sometimes cruel keep
wild things they have trapped or men who
put beasts behind bars for a zoo only
tiburi and his fellows would devise brutal
tortures for their captives hoopers face
grew stern

  i may buy them he said or i may
come and take them is the chief of them
alive

  he is alive but how shall you take
them unless you make me gifts the bush
is thick my men are many these are
not all

  tiburi pointed to the canoes once more
in a closing crescent to starboard of the
schooner with the retailing of his victory
tiburi grew more arrogant

  hoopers brows met his eyes flashed his
voice was imperative

  how he demanded how shall i get
them i will show you

  then he changed his tone

  first i will show you gifts tiburi
many gifts and many wonders come with
me give him another drink thompson
and tell fong to get ready he added in
english its time to put the fear of god
in their hearts once and for all

  tiburi gulped down the gin and swag-
gered after hooper for a moment he hes-
itated at the companionway and then de-
scended he had talked big and nothing
had happened he would get many gifts
for these captives of his perhaps if he was
cunning he would get the gifts and more
captives the strong liquor mounted to
his brain he had forgotten about him
who walks under the water

  and then he saw him mammoth ma-
jestic seated on a couch of red the same
god surely who had walked up from the
waters he had not taken in many details
but here was the same enormous head with
its big round staring eyes the wrinkled
flesh that glittered in spots like the fire-
sticks he had taken from steiner but could
not work

  the god held up a hand but did not speak
it did not seem to have a mouth but
there were tentacles coming from the place
where a mouth should have been tentacles
like that of the giant squid tiburis knees

weakened his valor dissolved as the god
slowly rose he turned and with a howl of
terror bolted up the stairs

  the canvas screen had been displaced
and coming over the rail dripping with
water was another god fong for a
moment tiburi stood paralyzed his men
had deserted him some had dived over-
board others were surrounded by the white
men holding fire-sticks he himself was
so surrounded not that the fire-sticks
actually threatened not that any hostile
move was made it was the look on the
faces of the white men the cold boring look
of hoopers eyes that convinced tiburi that
he stood between the devil and the deep sea
or rather the devil stood between him the
deep sea or his own island unless he did
what the white men who were in league
with the devil wanted

  this second him who walks under the
water stood silent gazing upon tiburi with
enormous immovable eyes that seemed to
read his soul to gaze upon him with the cold
wrath of an easily offended god its very
silence was terrible disdainful it was too
much for tiburi

  yet he was a chief and there was a certain
stiffness to his make-up that had given him
leadership and helped him to maintain it
though his knees wobbled and his very
bowels crawled about within his pot-belly
like so many eels he resisted the impulse to
fling himself upon the deck on all fours
savage though he was he held manhood
and hooper accorded him a measure of
respect

  the skipper nodded to thompson with a
jerk of his thumb toward the companion-
way as fong terrific in his armor the
water puddling from him on the deck stood
mute and motionless gasps of horror from
his tribesmen caused tiburi to look fear-
fully about and see the helmeted tentacled
head of manning the him who walks
slowly appearing at the head of the com-
panionway mounting from the cabin the
chief gulped convulsively summoning the
remnant of his courage and words to help
save his face

  show me the gifts he said sullenly
and i will deliver the white men- to you

  good answered hooper tommy
bring up the stuff we laid out

  thompson and two men brought up the
trade and displayed it on deck tiburis
eyes glittered he had a better brain
no mans island



than his fellows but it was apt to move in a
groove to hold but one idea at a time
now it was greed tinged with vanity what
a showing he would make before his wives
especially the new ones but fear was still
in the background

  tell your men to put them in the canoes
tiburi i shall go ashore with you he
ordered a boat lowered

  tiburi looked at the gods 

  do these go also he asked and his
voice squeaked despite all his- efforts

  they dwell in the sea said hooper
driving the lesson home he did not want
to have to bother with any more mas-
querading than was necessary when
they leave the sea for the land they bring
the sea with them unless they are friendly
to those who live on the land if you break
faith with me tiburi they will surely come
and the sea will rise above your land and
you and your tribe will be dragged to the
bottom and be eaten alive as a squid tears
at a live fish with its beak

  tiburi shuddered hooper made a sa-
laam in front of fong and the chinaman
lifted his hand the whale-boat was low-
ered and four rowers got into it with the
four men edwards had brought the trade
was put into the canoe and tiburi and his
bodyguard of ten went overside hooper
gave an order or two to andersen and with
thompson prepared to enter the whale-
boat after a word with edwards all the
white men were fully armed

  at the gunwale hooper paused turned
and dived into the cabin manning was
now on deck standing with fong at the rail
nearest to the canoes tiburis big war-
craft was paddling away with quickening
strokes eager to leave the vicinity of the
hims yet anxious not to displease hooper
with whom the hims were so friendly

  hooper came on deck with the bundle of
newspapers destined for steiners perusal
and enlightenment under his arm he had
no desire to augment the ober-leutnants
misery he was going to relieve it physi-
cally mentally he thought a tonic would
do the german officer good it would help
to make a pacifist of him until hooper de-
livered him to the naval commandant at
honolulu

  and that was going to be a problem it
would overcrowd the mary l seriously af-
fect the question of rations all along
hooper had prepared for a fight with

steiner though he had been willing to avoid
it now in the whirligig of things he had
to rescue him for they were all white men
together and the war was over

  the whale-boat with springy strokes
forged up alongside tiburis canoe the
rest spread out to right and left a savage
escort though the cannibals were plainly
subdued from the rail of the schooner
their shapeless arms folded the two hims
were regarding the canoes

  do the gods not speak asked tiburi

  it is not necessary replied hooper
they can read the mind and force their
will upon it and if they spoke their
voice would crack your ears

  tiburi nodded he had asked humbly
for knowledge

  see said hooper i will prove it

  he let his hand which was on the gun-
wale trail in the water casually aboard
the schooner andersen watching for the
signal passed the word down to ling the
engine started was thrown into reverse
with a slight disturbance of the water the
mary  without paddles without sails be-
gan once more to move-backward

a cry went up from the canoes
tiburi gray of face but game
encouraged by the gifts that were
piled in his canoe shouted fiercely to his
paddlers to keep quiet but all the rest of
the flotilla like minnows threatened on the
shoals by a hungry bass went darting for
the reef the churning water was to all of
them positive evidence that a him was
towing the schooner from beneath the
water perhaps with its hands clutching the
keel and the two hims were still on deck
they pictured the sea swarming with lesser
gods horrible shapes

  yah verily it was a wise thing to be
friendly with these white men and their
supernatural allies

  the mary l backed for a while then
sped ahead in a wide curve off the reef-
gate too shallow for her entrance she
paused while tiburi following his craven
men went through and hooper trailed
him

  manning with the aid of edwards di-
vested himself of his helmet and diving-
dress fong followed suit manning was
drenched in sweat the masquerade main-
tained in such weather had been no joke
fong was in much the same shape


adventure

  shall i bring you something to drink
sir askedjedwards	s

  got anything cool

  theres ice sir last time we made it i
stowed some away in sawdust at the bottom
of the hold it melts fast but theres a little
left while were in port sir ill start the
machine up again if you can spare the gaso-
line for the engine

  ask the skipper about that but dig
up a chunk of that ice and make me a long
cool drink with lemons in it and you can
put in a stick of gin for once how about
it fong have one

  fong signified his assent and with the
slightest raising of his eyebrows as if in
tolerance of mannings familiarity with
a chinaman edwards disappeared the
only liquor aboard was the small quantity
brought along for such purposes as it had
served with tiburi and kept strictly from
the crew edwards was accountable for it
presently he appeared with two long gin
rickies he did not hand fong his but set
it down

  edwards said manning a bit sharply
youre a good steward but i suppose every
good steward is a good deal of a snob
sir

  ive entrusted my life to fong here a
good many times and i esteem my life a
good deal more than i do silly ideas of caste
fong is my friend serve him

  fongs face was imperturbable as ed-
wards with an i beg your pardon sir to
manning picked up the ricky and tendered
it to the chinaman manning was aware
of a tension between the pair a mental
static that might crackle with discharge at
any moment the enmity between them
was no small matter it was plain and he
began to wonder whether he had not been
foolish to force edwards hand still the
man was only a steward for a voyage

  does the skipper expect to bring those
germans aboard sir asked edwards i
understand there have some of them been
killed but there must be nearly twenty of
them i was thinking of accommodations
and the provisions sir

  fong gave a peculiar little grunt not
quite a cough manning knew what that
meant-disapproval but he was inclined
to think fong prejudiced against edwards

  i dont know edwards i didnt hear
what was said between mr hooper and the
chief you know there were twenty-three

of them when hooper and thompson got
away i should think it would be a good
idea to set a guard over them somewhere in
the crater until we are ready to sail per-
haps in their old camp as for provi-
sions we can supplement our stores from
shore in many ways

  yes sir of course sir i hadnt
thought of that the plan of frightening
them with the diving-suits was a tremen-
dous success i should call it a great idea
ah said manning dryly if there
was anything he disliked about edwards it
was the suggestion of flattery the latter in-
jected into much of his talk that will be
all he said

  edwards withdrew still with a faint but
distinct suggestion of his lack of compre-
hension of a cook being left drinking on an
equality with the skippers partner in the
cabin mild disapproval

  dont like edwards any better now
fong asked manning

  i tell you one-two time he too -

slick answered fong all the time he
ask too many question what for he ask so
much because he want to know what

he know he use too-slick

  manning finished his ricky reflectively
he had a high regard for fongs judgment
of men and a tiny distrust of edwards
had crept into his own mind perhaps he
would bear watching not that he could
do much he decided

a crowd of naked children who
had been poking bamboo canes
v through the bars of a stockade
fled like so many monkeys before the ap-
proach of the white men accompanying their
chief diving into the jungle from which their
eyes stared in awe and wonder tiburi
strode ahead and pointing to the enclosure
which was literally a great cage roofed as
well as walled with bamboos stoutly driven
into the earth cross-barred with others ex-
claimed-

  there are your white men o friends of
him who walks under the water
hooper approached with thompson close
to the stockade and peered in shadows
from the surrounding bush darkened it a
few shafts of sunshine streaked it here and
there with light a dirt compound in which
were raised a few tent-like structures of
no mans island



palm-leaves dried and interwoven for a
moment he could see nothing else save a
few calabashes in the foreground and some
shards and husks of coconuts

  the place was damp and stank of decay
and filth sprawled out beneath the miser-
able edifices he made out the prone figures
of men brown as natives but bearded with
long lank hair apparently naked listless
almost lifeless apathetic to everything

  one of them stirred feebly got upon all
fours and crawled out from a shelter out
of the bush of matted blond whiskers and
tousled hair there shone in a ray of sun the
light-blue eyes of a white man a teuton
the eyes widened as their owner caught
sight of hooper and his companions

  with an effort he got to his feet grasping
a staff of bamboo and tottered forward
he stopped five feet short of the stockade
his face working with unbelief with growing
credulity with a wild feverish gleam that
held fear then the fear vanished and
something like hate wan and overwrought
took place the bony shoulders straight-
ened the head went back

  no one friend nor foe could gaze on such
a sight without pity all the resentment
that hooper had held in the back of his
brain against them remembering the crews
he had sent out in their own boats from the
sunken ships remembering even his own
faithful kanakas the cook and polu the
mate remembering his own servitude
dwindled vanished the pity showed in
his eyes and the man in the stockade
glared back defiance it was steiner

  back of him his comrades were coming
out blinking dragging themselves ex-
hausted with effort before they compassed
half the distance to the bars squatting with
chests heaving painfully with the effort of
progress mere shells of manhood with eyes
that lacked the fire in their leaders eyes
that had learned to look only for fresh
torment

  where the sunbeams striped and spotted
them scars showed the sting-marks of in-
sects half-healed festering wounds one
or two had filthy rags about their loins the
rest had none or had ceased to care for
decency their blue eyes were pallid in the
deep hollows ribs and hips protruded el-
bows and knees appeared frightfully swol-
len between the sticks that represented their
limbs hooper turned to tiburi with a
sudden blaze in his own eyes before which

the chief quailed though he did not under-
stand the reason were these not the ene-
mies of the friend of him had he not de-
livered them still alive to be repaid for
what they had themselves done when
masters

  steiners voice was a croak seeming to
come unwillingly from deep in his chest
hooper thought that none of them had
spoken for a long time

  it is you hooper he said in guttural
but excellent english so you escaped
and you have come back in force or
have you come back to this no mans
island to escape your conquerors

  he stopped and his knees trembled he
gripped his staff and struggled for mastery
for strength to go on talking his teeth
gritted with the effort and his eyes dilated
hooper fancied his mind hanging in the
balance

  deutschland deutschland iiber allesl
croaked steiner

  hoopers pity was tinged with admira-
tion here was a man for all his mistaken
creeds

  give me the chocolate thompson he
said

  thompson gave the skipper the cakes of
concentrated nourishment he had brought
up from the stores and hooper proffered
them between two of the bars steiner
made no move to take them hooper tossed
them within and instantly the men began to
crawl toward them tearing at the paper
and foil with their teeth munching at them
like starving apes

  the war is over steiner said hooper

  ja and we are over all you you

with your - chocolate you have run

away and you think to revenge yourself
upon me but you will pay jal for
you have lost your country american pig
my race is master for me-

  he shrugged his shoulders and all the
bones of his torso shuffled hideously be-
neath the thin covering of skin and tissue
and worn muscles

  germany did not win the war steiner
and now there is no war i have not come
for revenge i have come to rescue you
from tiburi

  you lie pig of an american you lie
it is impossible

  but conviction of the truth crept into
him from hoopers steady almost sympa-
thetic glance steiner began to foam at the


adventure

mouth his skull-like face was convulsed
his eyes watched hooper as the skipper un-
tied and unfolded the papers he had
brought his lips curved back over his
teeth and he shook like a leaf clutching his
bamboo support

  here are papers printed papers dating
far back steiner i expected you would
doubt my word and i brought these to con-
vince you dont make a fool of yourself
and tear them up i do not want to taunt
you the world is trying to be at peace
again i shall send you up clothes and
food so that you can feel fed and decent
again you shall be taken out of this
place

  and then what give me the papers
unless they are some trick

  i would hardly go to all that trouble
steiner you will see they are authentic
what do you intend to do with us to
take us prisoners ill rot here first
you can take your choice steiner said
hooper coldly you will be under guard
because there are a good many of you and
when you get back your strength you may
attempt tricks yourself but you are not
prisoners there is no more war between
us i will take you and your men back to
honolulu in a few days and from there i
imagine you will be sent home to ger-
many

  no

  or you can stay as you are dont be a
proud fool steiner youve lost ger-
many has gone back across the rhine ill
send up those things i mentioned and then
well transfer you to your old camp on the
crater terrace till we sail i didnt come
back on your account but i am giving you
choice between tiburi and germany

  if you speak the truth- steiners tone
quavered for he felt that hooper was not
talking lightly-by what right do you take
me back this island belongs to no man
you have no authority here i will accept
nothing from you

  better take the papers hooper tossed
them inside the palisade you will be
more reasonable when we come back
steiner spurned the newspapers with a
kick he snarled at hooper broke into a
torrent of teutonic invective and turned his
back walking away his shoulders heaved
his spirit was in the throes of humiliation
but his men dragged themselves up to the
bars they took the papers and glanced at

them one of them was able to read the
english characters and he began to spell out
to a little group others begged for more
chocolate as hooper turned away they
set up a wailing cry

  well be back hooper assured them
what have they been fed on he de-
manded of tiburi

  coconuts replied the chief a man
can live on coconuts

  hooper turned away down the bush trail
that led past the village to the sea he did
not want to break with tiburi but his heart
was sick within him

   i never fancied id feel particularly sorry
for steiner tommy he said he had to
have the news and the papers were the best
way of convincing him but i think of no
greater torture than it will be for him to
read them under the circumstances
either break him or make him commit
murder first chance he gets said thomp-
son not that im not sorry for those poor
devils theyve been starved and prodded
and stung half to death tiburi ought to
get a taste of his own medicine he ought
to be fed on half a coconut a day an old one
with sour milk till his pot-belly blows up
with gas

  for a cannibal hes been lenient said
hooper though it was only because white
flesh makes them sick we cant take it out
on tiburi but ill give him a few pointers
about how to treat white men before we
leave of course he had some repayments
of his own to make to that crowd but he has
got to learn to respect our stock the white
race how ill have to work out

  well tackle that inner reef-entrance
he went on blast it through enough for
the schooner to get into the crater lagoon
then well get the pearls and sail away from
this place as soon as possible no mans
island thats a good name for it

  you can go back with the clothes and
food tommy maybe manning will want
to go well transfer steiner and his crowd
to the schooner a day or so will work won-
ders with them they need quinine
tiburi halted at his village he was keen
to examine his gifts more carefully to array
himself in them

  ill send back for the white men said
hooper curtly i want some fish and fruit
from you tiburi ill pay you for them
and i may need some of your men for work
we shall go to the crater this afternoon
no mans island



him who walks under the water will be
with us both hims

  tiburi blinked savage-like he had tem-
porarily forgotten the hims

all that you want is yours he said
thanks to mannings idea of the diving-
suits said hooper to thompson as they
descended to the beach and the waiting
whale-boat

viii

        as a final object-lesson to tiburi
the mary l proceeded under power
to the crater steiner and his men
many of them pitifully weak from fever
dysentery and semi-starvation were as-
sembled amidships between fore and main-
mast there seemed little occasion to guard
men in such condition but hooper took no
chances and four of the crew patrolled with
automatics and rifles

  with the completion of the task well in
sight hooper unleashed his energies after
a short consultation with manning he
ordered steiner to be brought down to the
cabin the ober-leulnant clad in white
ducks that fitted him fairly well braced by
the food taken up to the stockade held
himself with rigid reserve that did not lack
dignity despite his tangle of hair and beard

  i am going to set you and your men
ashore on the terrace steiner said hooper
in your own camp you will be supplied
with provisions and utensils and you will
arrange for your own cooking you will
also have medicines and bedding you
will not attempt to leave the terrace
steiner erect impassive said nothing
but his light blue eyes were baleful he
carried the newspapers under his arm

  you will be guarded for your own
safety as well as my own peace of mind
went on hooper i do not trust you
when we are ready to leave we shall take
you with us to honolulu that is all i
have provided the means for hair-cutting
and shaving he added

  without a word steiner turned and left
the cabin followed by the man who had
come with him as a guard

  he hardly looks dangerous suggested
manning but ive an idea the man is
consumed with curiosity he knows you
did not come down here solely on his ac-
count and that type is always dangerous
none of the crowd are seriously sick

replied hooper a few days of good food
and a little medicine and freedom from that
stockade and theyll pick up again they
are a sturdy lot sixteen of them all told
that means tiburi has seven skulls in his
house i dont see what they could do but
we had best be careful there were some
articles in those papers that spoke of pun-
ishment to those germans vho had been
foremost in horribleness steiner has sev-
eral boats crews on his mind-not on his
conscience he may fear reprisal at hono-
lulu a trial or being handed over to the
allied authorities for court martial i
hardly think it likely but it is possible of
course that will be up to the naval com-
mandant or whoever takes them over

  hell likely instil that idea into his men
and regain some official control over them
shouldnt wondfer if he has already by sheer
example in that stockade prison he was
the only man who retained any show of grit
i wouldnt wonder if the rest of them were
sorry the war ever started and glad its over
but they are all puppets and steiner is their
strong man

  hed like to get possession of the
schooner and emulate the survivors of the
emden i imagine said manning but i
dont see where theyve got much chance to
do more than grit their teeth have a hard
time getting away from that terrace with
tiburi waiting to scoop them up and glean
more gifts as a reward

  well guard them just the same ill
use those four men edwards gave us for one
watch time they began to earn their
wages smith holabird white and hayes
andersen and thompson with the finn and
another sailor can relieve them watch
and watch eight hours that leaves your
assistants free for your job

  andersen came part way down the com-
panion to report

  heading up for that reef opening sir
all right ill take the deck port and
starboard boats to be ready after we anchor
edwards will superintend putting supplies
aboard for the germans we are going to
maroon them on the terrace until we sail
arm smith hayes holabird and white
with rifles and automatics extra clips and
full magazines theyre to go on guard until
nine this evening you and thompson
will relieve them ill see you about the
details later

  they followed the mate on deck where


adventure

he prepared to carry out his orders hooper
himself mounted to the fore-spreaders to
con the schooner through the entrance in
the outer reef the tide was flooding and
there was plenty of water under their keel
in the narrow break in the coral he or-
dered the wheel aport and the mary l en-
tered the placid channel between the two
reefs coming to anchor in fourteen fathoms
with a spring cable to a kedge carried to the
inner reef for extra precaution the
barometer was steady the weather prom-
ised fair

  the boats were filled manning and
hooper in the stem of one thompson and
edwards in the other all four carried
pistols two armed guards were in each
boat the second entrance was plainly too
shallow for any attempt to take the schooner
inside the lagoon proper and it was wide-
ledged hooper and manning both gaged
it closely as their boat went through
t take days to blast that said manning
waste of time i think youll be needing
the whale-boats i suppose why not get
two big canoes from tiburi and put a plat-
form on them for my equipment

  good idea you are going to use the
suit that needs the air-pump

  i prefer it may use both cant tell
till i make a descent sand may have filled
in in that case ill use fong to help me
where is the wreck

  they spoke in low tones it was obvious
that the sailors were all ears leaning far
forward on their strokes to catch a word

  about a quarter of a mile to the right
said hooper well take a look at it as we
come back

  the gap in the side of the crater which
had once emptied it of lava and later ad-
mitted the sea showed like the blow of a
giants ax in the cliffs of obsidian as they
neared it and caught a fair view of the inner
walls the contrast was startling half of
the crater was in shadow though it was only
midaftemoon the ocher half showed a
jungle of vivid green palms lifting here
and there water streaming down the sides
one f these cascades fell to a tiny beach
to their left just inside the entrance

  at the far end the great images stood on
their stone terrace staring at the invaders
with blind eyes elliptical in shape carven
deeply in the lava as they came closer a
trick of light and shade gave them a sem-
blance of crafty watching there were

eleven of these gods graven and set up by
a forgotten race the largest was in the
center and the cliff had crumbled under its
weight a fissure showing beneath the pedes-
tal so that the image tilted forward at
a dangerous angle threatening whoever in-
truded into this crater temple

  trees had sprouted along the terrace and
vines twined between the slim trunks one
of these lianas had fairly lassoed the small-
est god and lifted it from its pedestal into
the air

  the bodies had been dwarfed and dis-
torted the great faces had long dispro-
portionate noses above grim lips there
was nothing of benignity about them
they seemed to be biding their time in
brooding resentment like strange mon-
sters turned to stone back of them showed
clefts in the cliff the caves of which hooper
had spoken

  below the terrace two trails led right and
left in zigzag from the beach where thomp-
son and hooper had been kept there too
were caves but open to the water the
trails had been fashioned into stairways
with wide shallow treads faced once with
stone slabs that had been shoved out of
place by the rank growth of bush and grass
some were entirely displaced

  the terrace was nearly twenty feet in
width on it were the grass houses that
steiner had built still in fair preservation
the germans were escorted to their old
camp and the guards installed after the
supplies were landed as the boats rowed
off manning twisting in the stern saw
steiner standing beside the great central
image less in height than the massive pedes-
tal staring down at them

hooper ordered one boat back to
the schooner and steered his own
along the inner reef manning got
ready a water-glass he had brought with
him a hopper-shaped lidless box with a
glass bottom part of his outfit hooper
gave the order to paddle slowly and hung
over the side one arm raised presently he
dropped it and the men ceased rowing

  back water easy there manning
were right over her

  the diver plunged the glass of his finder
below the surface leaning far over the
gunwale his face lost in the box

  he saw far down through the crystal
water as if he had been looking through
no mans island



green glass the broken hull of the moana-
manu shoals of brilliant-colored fish swam
about above it and played over the decks
and through the gaps in the planks sea-
growths had sprung up already waving
gently in the undercurrents the bottom
was sandy patched with coral thick with
marine shrubbery the rowers poised their
oars their eyes shifting wide with curiosity
the dripping from the blades to the surface
of the still lagoon was the only sound in the
boat

  manning raised his head

  masts all gone by the board he said
nasty tangle of rigging decks are badly
broken but that would be the air inner
decks likely intact but therell be sand
inside the hull by the looks of it well
have to clear it and that is a tedious job
well make two descents a day its
clumsy work using hand tools two days
job i reckon it make it three after we
get started

  weve had enough for one day i think
said hooper i fancy our friend tiburi
will be round bright and early tomorrow
to see if he can get some more trade not to
mention gin well have the tribe on top
of us most of the time like so many kids
and as long as you and fong are working
in the suits as harmless well set some of
them to work fixing up your pontoon for
you logs across the canoes and then grat-
ings and planks for the real deck will do it
the rest can stock us up with fresh provis-
ions

  look at those mullet he cried as a
school of silver fish rose above the surface
two and three-pounders we must have
a mess or two of those before we go finest
eating in the world well dynamite em
thats the only use were likely to have for
the stuff im thinking

 he spoke buoyantly and manning was
in like mood the sight of the sunken wreck
made the pearls seem more real almost
tangible the divers experience told him
that the task that lay before them was not
overdifficult soon they would be off for
honolulu with a third of a million dollars
in gems aboard and from this adventure
he looked forward to others wtith hooper
where and what time would show there
was always something to be turned up
south of cancer for men of their kidney
all thoughts of retirement ashore or cruis-
ing for pleasure in a little sloop had left him

  at nine the relief went off to the terrace
and the four guards came back to report
that steiner had established order in his
camp and that the men were cheerful
they had cleared out two of the houses and
occupied them there was fresh water in
one of the caves

  last i see of em holabird told his
skipper one yf em was playin barber to
the rest the officer he got shaved first of
all and had his hair clipped short to his
head hes got one house all to himself and
two of em told off to wait on him three
or four seem pretty sick but the rest are
lively enough cooked up somie chow that
smelled mighty good turned in by now
i guess

  all right holabird you four will re-
lieve mr andersens guard at five in the
morning better turn in yourselves now
youll be on until two bells in the afternoon
watch

  the man saluted and went on deck

  but neither he nor his companions turned
in when manning and hooper went up-
manning having proposed and hooper hav-
ing accepted the suggestion that in the
absence of the mate they should split the
deck watch for hooper did not place im-
plicit confidence in tiburi-they found the
watch on deck the watch below and the
four guards gathered in groups discussing
something avidly in low tones

  there were no duties to be performed at
anchor except a perfunctory one or two
there was no especial rule that the men
should not stay on deck but hooper after
an hour sent the guards below with the
admonition that he wanted them to get
their rest in order to perform properly their
duty

  manning was to watch until midnight
and hooper turned in the seamen kept
chatting and manning pacing the after-
deck saw the glow of their pipes and heard
now and then a voice raised and quickly
hushed the topic of conversation was
evidently both exciting and communal

  he could not eavesdrop if he went for-
ward they would stop talking but he
sensed something afoot and was not sur-
prized when at last the watch below hav-
ing exhausted their interest or dulled it suffi-
ciently to sleep a figure came forward along
the port rail and spoke it was fong

  there being no helmsman manning was
alone on the after-deck there was no


adventure

moon and fong padding in his felted shoes
as softly as a cat drifted like a shadow
the watch on deck had gathered in the
bows taking anchor privilege of a cat-nap
what is it fong asked manning
crew talk too much along that sunk
ship inside lagoon said fong his voice
dropped to a pipe clear enough to manning
but inaudible six feet away too much
they talk why-for you dive some think
gold some speak peahl plenty too much
talk they make they speak along those
fo men edwad bling with him talk they
should have mo big piecee pay all same
divide that gold that peahl want that
two hundled fifty dolla you plomise want
mo want it now tomollow that
edwad talk along that way i think
make double -

  edwards wasnt on deck

  too slick fo that all same he tly
make double tomollow you see i smoke
one lil pipe in galley they forget they
think me sleep i sabby all they talk

  all right fong thanks ill talk it
over with mr hooper

  it was food for thought the wreck and
its mystery had infected the crew talk of
treasure enormously magnified without
doubt breeding greed

  hooper was not disposed to make light
of it when he came up at eight bells

  ill have a little talk with edwards he
said i suppose he has been entertaining
them and himself at the same time but
that crew is poor material for bolshevism
well nip that in the bud the mistake
weve made is to have not told them at the
start what we were after that it was my
own property but well mend that we
have no proof that edwards is in this
fong and he dont hit it off

  fong doesnt jump at conclusions said
manning good night

  at dawn the first canoes of tiburi put in
an appearance hovering outside both reefs
until the chief came along in his big canoe
two hours later

  manning had come on deck again at four
had sen the relief go off to the crater at
five and the boat return with andersen
thompson and their two assistants eager
for a mug-up and sleep

  tiburi sheered alongside at six bells
greeting manning with a grin it was the
first time the chief had seen him not dream-
ing that here was him who walks tiburi

was togged up in beads and rings and gaudy
trade handkerchiefs knotted about his loins
and he was evidentiy much pleased he
made signs of wanting to come aboard after
he sensed that manning could not under-
stand his talk a fact that evidently low-
ered the diver in his estimation

  edwards came on deck at this point and
approached the rail calling out a greeting
in native

  do you talk melanesian asked man-
ning

   i know something of the dialect sir

  manning was conscious of annoyance at
this fresh proof of edwards ability the
man was too clever to be a steward he de-
cided and for the first time he wondered
why the man had shipped a real distrust
of him began to evolve and then he real-
ized he might be biased

  wants to come aboard doesnt he
he asked the steward

   he says he brings gifts one big gift
said edwards hell be wanting some-
thing in return sir including gin shall
we let him up

  with five men only and call the cap-
tain

   very good sir

  edwards spoke a few words and spread
the fingers of one hand instantly tiburi
and five natives came over the side grin-
ning amiably the chief had a bundle in
his hand tied up in tapa cloth the canoe
was piled up with fruit fish and two young
freshly slaughtered pigs these were
handed up and deposited on deck showily
while edwards called hooper who came on
deck in his pajamas

  edwards followed with a gin-bottle at
the sight of which tiburi drooled at a
gesture from the skipper the steward poured
out a generous measure in a glass tiburi
reached for it with one hand and preempted
the bottle with his other capacious paw
his men watched him with envious eyes as
he swallowed the fiery stuff ignoring the
glass after he had emptied it and applying
himselfto the bottle the package in tapa
cloth he had put between his feet

  tzhah evah

  he smacked his lips with supreme con-
tent then broke into a babble of melanesian
edwards standing by manning translated
for the latters benefit

  he says he brings one very big gift to
show his friendship he has never before
no mans island



made such a gift and he hopes the skip-
per will bear that in mind when he makes
gifts in return

  tiburi finished his oration and then did
the same thing to the bottle of squareface
apparently it had no other effect upon him
than to make him genial and warm his pot-
belly which he rubbed  appreciatively
then he squatted on his haunches and un-
rolled the tapa-cloth bundle

ja seven hideous gruesome things
rolled out clumsily on the deck
they were the heads of men not
skulls but heads smoked for preservation
the curing-process had apparently not been
completed the dried flesh looked like
gutta-percha the twisted lips were set in
sardonic smiles three of them bore wisps
of yellow mustaches the others were clean-
shaven none of them had beards

  up to the time of tiburis successful coup
against steiners camp they had evidently
possessed a razor but no shears the hair
was long save for one head which was bald
and from one of these had come the gold-
filled teeth that decorated tiburis neck-
lace he picked up one of the heads by its
tow-colored locks and proffered it to
hooper with a smile that showed his filed
weth and another flow of words

  to give away heads he says is to do
what no other chief has done now he has
delivered all the skippers enemies so far
as he is able

  hooper stood his ground surveying the
relics gravely manning had harder work
to control his feelings hooper turned to
edwards

  bring up some trade he said not
too much and one of the trade axes for
the chief bring something to put these in
he appeared to manning to be thanking
tiburi with sufficient emphasis to suit the
chief who replaced the heads in their pack-
age and stood up expectant of the return
gifts edwards appeared with handker-
chiefs and beads and with a cheap hatchet
which hooper presented in person tiburi
took the ax and felt its edge wheeled and
brandished it suddenly above the heads of
his men delighted as a child with a new toy

  well have to give those heads decent
burial said hooper to manning they
prove that he is properly impressed with
us at any rate

  well have to keep him away from the

schooner while we are diving said man-
ning if he sees fong or myself with our
helmets off or even being rowed over to the
pontoon fully dressed hell smell a rat
he seems smart enough cjods wouldnt
use a boat not water-gods anyway if he
ever tumbles to the fact that we are just
men recognizes the fact that the god is me
dressed up therell be trouble

  ive thought of that said hooper
its easily fixed ill tell him the hims are
going to get something for us out of the
wreck he knows about the wreck of
course and ill tell him they are going to
establish a tabu well set up stakes on the
reef with red cloth on em and put out buoys
with red flags theyll keep outside them
and well make them far enough way from
the pontoon to keep them guessing we
can rig up a screen on the pontoon like we
did on deck

  he spoke to tiburi authoritatively and
the savage listened with awe creeping into
his features then he smiled answered
went to the fail and shouted an order
gathered up his gifts looked longingly
and suggestively at the empty bottle and
with his men departed overside paddling
away through the inner reef toward the
crater the other canoes followed him
two canoes had darted away at his com-
mand going fast in the direction of the cone

  he will respect the tabu said hooper
he has sent for two canoes for your pon-
toon and his men will furnish green timber
for the under platform also all the pro-
visions we want to take they are going to
camp on that little beach just inside where
the water all comes down so as to be haidy
partly fear partly hope of more gifts and
mostly curiosity

  whats the engine running for he
asked edwards as he caught the sound of
the exhaust

  i ordered it connected up with the ice-
machine sir said edwards we need
some and i thought a cake of ice might sur-
prize the chief nothing like a little magic
to keep them impressed sir

  humph all right the ice-machine
was part of the original equipment of the
mary l and its product was very accept-
able look here edwards hooper went
on have you been talking with the men
about what we are after in the wreck
they seem to have got some exaggerated
ideas about it im going to have a talk


adventure

with the whole ships company later
theyve been wondering about it na-
turally sir replied edwards frankly
the idea of a wreck and divers would be
sure to stir up talk they mentioned it to
me some of them and i told them i didnt
know suggested theyd all know for them-
selves before long but you cant keep sail-
ors from gamming sir theyve got an
idea its gold i think his face was in-
curious his manner usual

  all right edwards ill attend to it
im holding you responsible for the stores
from new on with mr thompson on guard-
duty and the gin

   yes sir i shall be careful sir

  late in the afternoon when white hola-
bird and the two other guards returned
from the terrace hooper assembled all the
crew thompson ws to talk to the two
sailors with him and andersen the mate
hooper had talked to in the cabin

  see here men he said theres been
talk among you of not being satisfied with
what has been promised you what of it
out with it one of you talk up

  his voice was brisk with authority it
was the first time he had shown sternness
and the men stiffened to the deep tone and
the flash of the skippers eyes they shuf-
fled but said nothing back of them fong
stood impassive

  come now warned hooper ill have
no behind-the-hand grumbling aboard you
holabird step out

  me sir i-

  you were gamming with the rest of
them talking about shares well settle
this right here and now

  holabird hemmed and hawed as the men
looked at each other in confusion wonder-
ing how the skipper had known of their talk
and they shoved holabird to the front

  we-we wanted to know just where our
bonus was coming from skipper he said
hesitatingly an when we was to get it
thats natural aint it you might turn us
off at honolulu an a pore mans word is no
good against a rich mans a muttered
aye from the rest encouraged him

  theres a law for treasure-trove aint
they or they ought to be shares for all
on the job

  hoopers eyes blazed and he advanced a
step holabird quailed a little but faced
him his eyes shifting inclined to be bellig-
erent

  treasure-trove thundered the skipper
who said anything about treasure-trove

i told you there were valuables aboard that
wreck mine as the ship was mine this
is a legitimate enterprise to recover my
property youre talking close to mutiny
my man and i know how to deal with that
and if you dont get it what about the
bonus asked holabird nothing signed
as to us gettin it one way or the other
some one prodded or pushed holabird
as hooper strode forward he lurched
stumbling one arm out against hooper
as the latter held him off holabird in a
sudden frenzy struck out instantly
hooper countered side-stepped and hit
him on the side of the jaw the man
slumped like a meal sack for a second it
looked as if there would be a rush man-
nings hand dropped to the holster of his
automatic rifles lay on the hatchway in
accordance with trading-vessel regulations
get forward all of you roared hooper
they obeyed holabird began to stir

  a-bad thing to have to do said

hooper to manning but if i hadnt
they would have misinterpreted it

  he stood over holabird who opened his
eyes and gazed up at him vacantly then
with an ugly gleam

  your own fault holabird said hooper
some one pushed you into me i wasnt
going to strike you till you hit out now
get down to your bunk youll get your
bonuses at honolulu if we carry this
through tell the rest of them that and
warn them to stop their silly jabbering
holabird got up slowly nursing his
bruised jaw manning thought he threw a
look of appeal toward edwards but the lat-
ter was not looking at him holabird sul-
lenly saluted and went forward suddenly
the atmosphere had changed aboard there
was a rift between forecastle and afterguard

next morning the rift had closed
to all appearances tiburi was on
hand with his men at dawn bring-
ing the two big canoes for the hull of the
pontoon and saplings for the under deck
every one worked with a will and the at-
mosphere seemed cleared holabird and
the other three of the relief guard went
away in the whale-boat cheerfully edwards
with them carrying to the terrace some of
no mans island



the fresh fruits and fish tiburis followers
supplied

  there was a surplusageof labor willing
but in the mass unintelligent the natives
in their canoes got in the way tiburi was
prodigal enough with his orders and if
hooper had not put a stop to it they wquld
have brought enough island provender to
stock a battle-cruiser he was forced t
establish the tabu lines early in the morn-
ing as soon as there was enough lumber in
sight for manning to complete his pontoon

  although he made no protests plainly in
awe of the hims it was evident that tiburi
did not relish the tabu hitherto that had
been his supreme privilege on the island and
his obedience to the restrictions of another
made him feel as if he had lost face to some
extent the schooner was a powerful mag-
net for the savage chieftain it was the
treasure-box that held many gifts that fur-
nished the gin he craved he had strong
liquors enough of his own but this brew the
white man supplied was different more
pungent and with a speedy stimulus to his
stomach that the native ferments no longer
held

  hooper was quick to see this mood and
to meet it

  the schooner is tabu between the time
the sun goes down and comes up again
tiburi he said it is tabu everywhere
within the red cloths while the hims are
helping us there will be many gods below
the waters and they do not wish to be spied
upon if they become angry i can not stop
them from visiting their wrath upon those
who have displeased them so long as the
red cloths fly you and your men must keep
outside the marks but the water-gods do
not work all day and when it is safe i will
take down the cloths and you are free to
visit the ship but only your canoe must
come alongside and only five of your men
must board with you

  tiburi looked his surprize at the five fin-
gers and promptly held up ten but
hooper frowned and shook his head

  five i tell you

  no sense in taking any chances at this
end of the game heboid manning when he
returned from setting up the tabu stakes in
the reef and putting out the floating mark-
ers  no sense either in getting tiburi
peeved so long as he serves us but his
kind is always treacherous and they have
memories only a little better than apes

as long as the object-lesson is in front of
them they respect it but they hold only
one idea at a time whether it is a matter
of gifts of supplying their stomachs or
making war i learned that in the new
hebrides

  theyll take a notion to make their vil-
lage strong as they call it which is just
showing-off or a chiefs son will die or a
crop will fail then they will swoop down
upon some friendly trader with whom they
have been chumming for months and mur-
der him seizing the excuse to raid his store

  his goods have been tickling the back of
their minds right along tiburi has no one
to show off to but his own following and
this him who walks business has to some
extent set him down in their opinion but
theyll keep the tabu so long as we dont
maintain it all the time

  manning glanced at the fluttering strips
of red cloth hooper had drawn a wide cir-
cle about the pontoon and the yacht with
the canvas screen opening seaward and
the natural confusion of several figures on
the raft together with the bulk of the pump
and other equipment it would be hard for
the savages keeping the distance to dis-
tinguish much of what was going on the
canvas screen would act as dressing-room
for the divers manning nodded his ap-
proval

  well change on the pontoon he said
and carry the suits back to the schooner
every night theyll need overhauling
working in sand is liable to wear the rub-
ber pontoons ready to anchor a bit to
shore of the wreck with enough cable to
allow for rise and fall of the tide the cur-
rents will set us up and down a bit

  hooper nodded in turn such matters of
adjustment he knew to be necessary as well
as manning but this was the divers job
and he was content to let him carry it
through without suggestion manning
knew his work so did his assistants they
were all competent and they labored to the
point fong with them like men who were
ued to each other and respected each
others capabilities the under deck had
been laid in place lashed and spiked on
this spare planks and gratings made a
smooth surface well supported by the two
buoyant hulls of built-up planks sewn with
sinnet calked with native gums the out-
riggers had been left on the canoes and the
contrivance was a complete success


adventure

  ill make two descents a day with
fong said manning an hour under-
water each time perhaps more but its
exhausting work its the sand that
bothers me could you warp in the
schooner closer to the reef without much
risk hooper

  so long as the weather holds yes
why

  that schooner yacht of ours has some
fancy quipment that will be useful like
the ice-machine i mean the fire-hose the
best way to handle sand is by hydraulic
force the same as they wash gravel banks
for gold if we couple up both those hoses
they will reach across the reef and down to
bottom i think if not we can sew up
some canvas i suppose for an extension
i see said hooper attach to the
engine and the pump and give you a strong
stream at the nozzle thats a new idea to
me fighting water with water

  it works said manning tricks to
all trades the hose is a mean thing to
handle down there but there will be two of
us will you tackle that end of it while i
anchor the pontoon we ought to get
everything ready today for a descent to-
morrow morning if weve any luck

  tiburi got no chance to board the
schoner that day the tabu flags did not
come down all hands labored hard to
complete the preliminaries and the sun was
close to the horizon before manning an-
nounced it satisfactory the canoe flo-
tilla between twenty and thirty craft
drawn up as if about to witness a regatta
remained well beyond the bounds all day
some of them fishing as the afternoon wore
on but all eager to watch what the white
men were about half-fearful of some demon-
stration from the hims

  tubiri left with his big canoe in mid-
afternoon hooper guessed him sulky and
as soon as it could be spared sent edwards
in a whale-boat over to the little beach
where the chief had settled himself he
bcrtfe a propitiation in the shape of a few
trinkets and two bottles of gin

  he was a bit peevish the steward re-
ported on his return but the gin mellowed
him sir i showed him a few little tricks
and got him amused

  the sailors who had rowed edwards
snickered at this as they held on to the
anchored pontoon and hooper looked at
them sharply

  what kind of tricks edwards he de-
manded

  nothing much sir just parlor con-
juring i used to do it sometimes for the
passengers aboard the moana at a concert
like this sir

  he held up a dollar and palmed it showed
it vanished produced it from the nose of
one of the sailors then he took out a ban-
danna handkerchief from his coat pocket
spread it on the pontoon deck folded in the
corners spread another one over it and
when he raised this again the first cloth
was piled with strings of beads small mir-
rors and brass curtain-rings

  i buried one of the bottles in the sand
sir said the steward with a deprecating
manner then i showed him the mango
trick only i used some scrub pandanus of
different heights a jap showed me how
to do that and it made a big hit with tiburi
especially when i told him to dig under the
roots and he found the bottle ive done
quite a bit in that way down in the fijis
sir where i learned my dialects and it al-
ways impressed the natives tiburi and his
men have never seen anything of that sort
sir i promised him to show him how to
make water boil without fire-the seidlitz-
powder trick sir

  humph hooper exchanged a glance
with manning and narrowed his eyes
thats all right tfor this once edwards
but after this mr manning or myself will
do the wonder-working too many wizards
spoil the show

  yes sir very well sir sorry if i over-
stepped sir

  edwards with fong transferred to the
pontoon had volunteered to cook and he
went off to the schooner to get supper ready

  that chaps too clever and too fond of
showing it hooper said to manning in a
low tone yet he never does anything
wthout a plausible excuse tacked on to it
but ill have to offset his tricks or tiburi
will be thinking him the whole show next
to the hims

  i agree with you answered manning
fong said it long ago too-slick

cant the next afternoon after the sec-
sfowji ond descent with the tabu tempo-
bqh rarily removed hooper received
tiburi and ushered him into the cabin
where he fearfully took a seat upon the red-
plush transom where him who walks had
no mans island

i

been throned glancing about him as if he
expected punishment for his temerity

  hooper like all trading captains had a
stock of simple tricks on hand for the diver-
sion and amazement of unsophisticated
natives most tribes were familiar with
them their own wizards used them mixed
in with devices of their own but tiburi
appeared to brook no conjuror in his tribe
and he himself was ripe for wonderment
steiner had shown him certain things and
edwards had gone further hooper pre-
pared to cap the climax

  he served the gin himself taking the bot-
tle from edwards and dismissing the stew-
ard in a manner that showed plainly who
was the supreme authority aboard he
winked at manning as he set down by the
chief a second tumbler which he stated con-
tained water knowing tiburi would ignore
it he himself had a third glass this he
sipped as tiburi gulped down his gin
manning had also helped himself to water
which he drank

  as tiburi poured himself another quan-
tum hooper reached out for his extra glass
and set it close to his own he had placed
on one of his fingers one of those paste dia-
monds made famous in minstrel shows and
the chiefs eyes had never left the sparkling
bauble hooper set the fingers of the ring-
bearing hand about one glass and lifted it

  can you make fire come out of water
tiburi he asked can you make water
boil without fire

  only the gods can do that answered
the chief a little uneasily he was alone in
the cabin with the two white men who held
authority on the schooner and he did not
like it talu did that when he brought up
the smoking islands from the bottom of the
sea he said

  it is easy went on hooper and poured
one dissolved seidlitz powder into another

  tiburis eyes goggled as the mixture
sizzed and apparently boiled over he
gasped when hooper quaffed half the hiss-
ing draught and handed the rest to man-
ning to finish he hastily lifted the half-
empty squareface to his lips and let the
stuff run down his throat to restore his
equanimity but hooper was not through
another gin-bottle stood in a rack un-
corked he took this and a tin cup beside
it and poured out a little liquid into the
latter

  now stand away he ordered

  tiburi watched him fascinatedly as he
struck a match and tossed it into the ounce
of gasoline it flared up with a vicious roar
toward the open skylight and tiburi in-
continently bolted for the deck the sight
of his men checked him and he turned his
back on them his face gray with fright
that he strove to fight down if this white
man could do this with water what might
not the hims accomplish

  hooper and manning had followed him
and hooper drew from his finger the mock
diamond

  because you are my friend he said to
tiburi placing the fake in the chiefs hol-
lowed slightly trembling palm

  tiburi straightened delight banished
fear for the time

  eyah he exclaimed and exhibited the
glittering thing to his five men here is
a gift from a friend to a friend

  and while his followers jabbered tiburi
strung the diamond on a sennit plait that
had held a disk of pearly shell roughly
carved into the semblance of a frigate-bird
he swelled his chest so that the jewel broke
out into little rainbows in the sunshine
and offered the pearl ornament to hoo-
per

  the skipper took it and handed it on to
manning who examined and returned it

  beware of a cannibal offering gifts he
said with a smile

  true enough said hooper but
weve got his goat for the time being

  and put edwards nose out of joint
muttered manning

  hooper pointed to the west

  the sun sinks he said to the chief
the ship will soon be tabu tiburi
seemed glad enough to take the hint and
his canoe was soon racing for the crater

  how did you get along today man-
ning asked hooper first chance ive
had to ask you

  good progress the hose works well
some sand will drift back with the tide but
weve got the bulk of it shifted its mainly
shifted in between decks and packed pretty
solidly but the floor of your traderoom
seems still solid the hull will be filled up
underneath clear into the frame of that
hatchway but i wouldnt be surprized but
what we got to the pearls the first trip down
the day after tomorrow i shant need
fong for that he can go back in the galley
again
 

adventure

  dont you like edwards chow asked
hooper quizzically

  im not stuck on anything he does
said manning

x

manning had been down for an
hour and a half it was the morn-
ing on which he expected to retrieve
the pearls and hooper was anxious not for
the gems but for the man he had come to
know as his friend to give some of that
whole-souled affection peculiar between
man and man a bond that once given out-
lasts all wear and tear

  he crouched at the head of the ladder
inside the canvas screen peering down at
the wreck he could see nothing of man-
ning hidden by the ragged upper deck but
a stream of bubbles came up constantly
from the azure transparency and showed
the pump was working

  beside him were two of the divers assist-
ants one held the signal-cord the other
tended life-line and air-tube careful that
the latter should not kink or chafe against
the side of the pontoon outside the screen
in plain view of the wondering ring of na-
tives in their canoes beyond the tabu flags
the third man toiled steadily at the com-
pressing-wheel of the pump

  the hose had been disconnected man-
ning had declared the way clear but he
seemed to have struck trouble

  hooper fidgeted with his faatch fong
had come on deck on the schooner and was
standing by the rail watching the pontoon

  an hour and thirty-eight minutes said
hooper pretty long spell isnt it

  ive known him stay down two hours
when he wanted to finish something ans-
wered the man with the signal-cord thats
mannings way hes all right hell be
done up when he comes out but ill bet my
bonus hes got what hes after if its
there

  i guess its there all right answered
hooper a little nervously

tides play strange tricks said the man

  hey bill you got a bite cried the sec-
ond helper

  the signal-cord jerked

hes coming up said the man excitedly

  hooper lent a hand to the stout life-line
leaning over they could see manning com-
ing into view through the broken planks
there was a swirl of water about him and

  his figure was distorted if he carried any-
thing they could not see it he clung to
the life-line and swayed up through the ten
fathoms bill coiling the signal-line as it
slacked the third man doing the same with
the air-pipe

  manning caught the ladder got his feet
on the lower rounds and rested to adjust
the pressure then he came up heavily as
the pontoon tilted slightly his helmeted
head appeared and hooper and one of the
men got hands under his shoulders and
hoisted him on to the float where he sat
limply his hands were chafed raw the
ends of his fingers bloody and he carried
no package

  but hooper did not think of that as he
helped to unscrew the helmet and held to
mannings lips a tot of gin the diver
swallowed the stuff and smiled

  got em he said touch and go
another month and wed nevecjiave found
em

  in my kit-bag he continued as one
man unlaced his heavy shoes and the third
helped him wriggle out of his suit belt and
its knife pendent crowbar and water-proof
pocket were already off hooper picked
them up and felt in the bag his eyes
brightened as he touched several cylindri-
cal objects and drew one out the wax paper
broken but the foil intact

  tarpaulin washed away rubber rotted
said manning getting to his feet a trifle
groggily sweat matting his thick crop of
hair and streaming down his face the
sand had packed up from below as i
thought it would worked in through the
chinks in the hatchway framing but the
pearls were there found one or two pack-
ages as i clawed the stuff out regular
sandstone count em hooper i think i
got them all

  theyre all here manning said
hooper clapping the other on the shoulder
and gripping in affectionately well start
back tomorrow edwards says steiners
crowd has livened up considerably not
that im considering them he weighed
the little packages in both his hands his
face aglow that third divvy doesnt go
between us manning he went on it-
halves partner

  the two shook hands

  a third was the agreement said man-
ning then as he read the others eyes
except on one condition
no mans island



  granted

  we go shares in everything from now
on im sick of diving lets get a schooner
and go into something together cruising
or trading unless youre tied up

  the thought of some woman in connec-
tion with hooper crossed his mind for the
first time

  not me replied hooper no strings
petticoat or otherwise if thats what youre
thinking old man so lets go aboard
boys well break the prohibition rules for
once outside the three-mile limit any-
way

  they all laughed at the light quip ex-
hilarated at the ending to the trip man-
ning put on his clothes they set the suit in
the boat and rowed off to the schooner
where fong was waiting them

  heap sabby you get all same he said
his yellow face beaming

  the men crowded up scenting the excite-
ment hooper sent edwards for the liquor

  a drink for success men he said
home tomorrow

  they gave three hearty cheers led by
the steward

  it was andersens shift aboard his relief
almost up he came on deck at the cheer-
ing followed by thompson manning took
hooper aside

  where does thompson come in he
asked just on the bonus

  im looking out for him said hooper

  you mean we are partner answered
manning

  as they started for the cabin the pack-
ages still unbroken andersen asked about
the tabu flags

  they heard the cheering sir he said
getting worked up

  keep them flying until after chow said
hooper then you can chuck the things
away were through come on man-
ning ive got something to open your
eyes

  and he hooked his arm familiarly through
that of the diver

  manning had seen pearls before but never
so many so symmetrical so full of fire
the foil had preserved their luster kept
them from the grinding grit of the sand
they were fuzzy with delicate bloom hooper
separated them and placed some in pairs

  worth fifty per cent more when they
match up he said ive worked hard to
get this bunch together he fondled

  them holding them in the cup of his hand
but there was no greed in his voice

  miracles to come out of a sick shellfish
arent they he said look at those two
pairs manning worth ten thousand dol-
lars in tahiti this minute well take em
to better markets

  hang it man he broke off we havent
fixed your fingers they are raw

  feel as if theyd been sandpapered
admitted manning as hooper gathered up
the pearls and put them away in a chamois
poke but- my main trouble is my
stomach its buckling two hours down
uses up all your fuel what are you going
to do withjjhem

  split em said hooper i bought
two belts youll wear half and so will i
come into my cabin and well fix them
while fongs bringing chow

  edwards had come in and started to lay
the table he glanced at the leather bag
but said nothing

  as soon as ive stowed away my outfit
said manning got any adhesive in the
medicine kit

  ill get it sir said edwards and dis-
appeared manning and hooper put away
the suit which had been carried down
earlier by fong the steward came back
with tape and scissors and hooper cut out
the pieces with which manning patched his
tom fingers then in hoopers cabin
they put away the pearls and adjusted the
belts the meal was ready when they came
out andersen and thompson joined
them

  you can tell steiner to get ready to
move tomorrow hooper said to the mate
on the ebb about noon well come for
them at six bells and as you go off take
up those tabu buoys and stakes

  what are you going to do this after-
noon manning he asked when the mate
and thompson had left after discussing
the find a little turn in

  got to dismantle the pontoon and get
the pump aboard

  your men can do that i imagine
youre tired out

  but not sleepy and i usually am
after a long spell under why

  i feel like a holiday lets go out ard
get a mess of mullet well give tiburi
another exhibition of fire and water and
its a heap of fun

  he spoke like a boy and manning entered


adventure

into his mood the job was done the
reaction strong

  ill go with you he said if its only
to see you dont blow off an arm ive
seen several cripples in the islands from
that game

  no danger if youre careful cut the
fuse right ruffle it up a bit stick a match
in it light the match count two and heave
the half a stick toss it fairly high bet-
ter to have it explode too soon than wet
the primer and sink dont take much to
stun the fish if we find a school tiburi
hasnt ever brought us any mullet theyre
rare eating

as they rowed off with two
sailors at the oars a box of the
dynamite in the stern they passed
mannings assistants working on the pon-
toon the pump had already been sent
off to the schooner and the men were taking
apart the decks preparatory to turning over
the canoes to the natives a dozen canoes
drifted at a respectful distance the savages
looking on at the white men or gazing into
the water

  therell be twenty of them diving down
presently to see what they can in the wreck
said hooper soon as they feel sure the
hims are gone they know weve got
something worth while out of it

  how about tiburi asked manning
if he comes off to the schooner i dont
see his canoe

  there it is hooper pointed to the
crater-entrance with the big canoe coming
out of it i left strict orders with ed-
wards no men to come aboard but the
chief and only one bottle of gin well gift
him up tomorrow before we leave he can
have everything thats in the traderoom
fongll keep an eye on him said man-
ning i dont trust that steward hooper
he happened along too handily in honolulu
with his four men

  theyve behaved themselves all right
except holabird and he took his lesson well
enough and weve got the pearls he
added as he slapped his belt hidden be-
neath his clothes that looks like a school
of mullet

  they rowed down the lagoon inside the
reef in the direction of a ripple that showed
just above the surface but the fish broke
water before they reached throwing-dis-
tance and they were not mullet

  manning helped hooper prepare their
grenades and they rowed about the reef
but luck with them in the big adventure
was niggardly with smaller gifts

  fish-sharks inside said hooper at
length wont go out till the tide turns
mullet are all inside the crater lagoon
get some tomorrow before we leave bet-
ter go back and see what tiburi is up to
his canoe is still alongside

  the pontoon was broken up by the time
they reached the schooner hooper gave
an order for hoisting the boat to the falls
and climbed the gangway ladder followed
by manning tiburi was not on deck
fong came out of his galley and pointed to
the cabin hooper frowned and moved
quickly to the open skylight looking down
manning beside him

  tiburi sat on the red-plush seat with
edwards beside him they seemed to
have been deep in conversation and the
steward gazed up suddenly with a startled
air duplicated by tiburi who rose uneasily
an empty gin-bottle was on the table
the two partners hurried down the ladder
and faced them hoopers brow was dark
with a frown

  who gave you the idea of entertaining
tiburi in the cabin he demanded sharply

  for once edwards seemed nonplussed
he licked his lips before he answered

  i didnt suppose there was any harm
in it sir i didnt mean it as a liberty
no men came aboard and theres only been
the one bottle the chief is crazy about
the furnishings sir he wants this settee
as a gift

  did you give it to him mannings
voice was sarcastic and the steward gave
him an ugly glance

  i did not sir

  all right edwards said hooper dryly
you may go forard

  the steward left with a quick look pass-
ing between him and the chief tiburi
had gathered himself together it was
plain t both the white men that edwards
had lied about the liquor though there was
only the one bottle in evidence tiburi
was inclined to swagger his eyes met
hoopers almost defiantly

  i am a big chief a great chief he
said pounding his chest so that the mock
jewel danced many men obey me
he worked his fingers rapidly edduadi
he big chief too
no mans island



  not so big as i am not so big as my
friend here said hooper quietly but with
meaning emphasis suppose you are so
big a chief do you want to drink some of
that firewater

  tiburi winced but recovered swaying a
little as the fumes of the gin vapored in his
brain

  not so big as him who walks under
the water tiburi went on hooper ob-
serving him carefully 

  he fiddled in his pocket for a gasoline
cigar-lighter he had filled and carried along
to ignite the dynamite-fuses suddenly he
brought it out and snapped it under tiburis
nose the flame sprang up aimost singe-
ing the chiefs skin upsetting his drunken
show of belligerency

  eyah he cried jumping back and
retreating backward up the companion-
way i am great chief with many
men you give me many gifts for me for
my men i am not afraid

  his effect was spoiled a trifle by the
haste with which he mounted still facing
them got into his canoe and paddled
swiftly off calling to the other canoes and
gathering them in his trail as he sped for
the crater

  now whats got into his fool head
said hooper just gin

  edwards said manning

  i agree with you hes gone a bit far
this trip but what is he up to

  we may find out tomorrow when we
go into the crater suggested manning

  i dont think tiburill make trouble
said hooper slowly hes drunk aside
from the hims who wont appear again
he knows weve got fire-sticks just as
well we didnt find any mullet if he
starts anything well make him think the
islands going up well take along the
dynamite when we go for steiner and
well go in with the relief tonight you and
i ready for pranks hell cool down when
hes sober it wouldnt do any good to
cross-examine edwards

  hed lie anyway said manning
probably i think with him its a case
of swelled head good thing all round
were through

  but tiburi made no demonstration hos-
tile or otherwise when they changed the
-guard that night coming and going they
saw the natives seated peaceably round
two fires on the little beach the low sound

of chanting sounding across the water

  peace meles chants said hooper
better than a drum and dancing tiburi
will be aboard tomorrow before we sail for
his gifts may as well leave him happy
hes served his turn

  going to give him the plush settee
asked manning

ive a good mind to and make ed-
wards pay for a new one laughed hooper

xi

the early hours of the next morn-
ing slipped by without a sign from
tiburi without sight of canoe or
native a lookout had reported to man-
ning acting as officer of the watch that
he thought he had seen canoes passing
through the reefs and had heard the sound
of paddling

  this was close to dawn but before the
sky had begun to lighten manning could
see nothing and could hear nothing other
than the soft booming of the surf and he
fancied the man mistaken for he had used
his eyes enough at sea to be sure of them

  the relief going in at nine oclock with
hooper in charge keenly on the lookout
for possible trouble saw canoes hauled out
on the small beach among them tiburis
own easily recognizable craft a number
of natives stood at the waters edge watch-
ing the whale-boat pass and repass with
andersen thompson and the two sailors
of the relieved watch everything seemed
as usual

  steiner and his crowd are starting
already to pack their dunnage hooper
told manning rest and food have done
them a world of good already and i think
the shaving and hair-cutting did as much
as anything steiner is a bullet-headed
junker once again and his men jump to his
authority told them wed come off for
them about eleven he seems to have made
up his mind to take it philosophically it
being a case of hobsons choice

  how about tiburi asked manning

  ive a notion hes just sulking wants
to get his farewell gifts and hates to come
aboard after the way he acted yesterday
he has sent some of his canoes away so
the lookout was right last night theyve
probably gone back to the cone and their
wives and families i imagine they are the
ones of least rank and will not share in the


adventure

trade split if tiburi gets over his sulks and
tries to come aboard

  edwards has hurt his leg pretty badly
according to his own account said man-
ning i saw him slip half-way down the
companion and he claims to have sprained
his ankle hes got it painted with iodine
and bandaged up now he couldnt do
more than hobble so i sent him to his bunk
exit edwards for the time being we
wont get much more out of him this trip
fongll have to do double duty but we can
make it easier for him aft

  he may be malingering suggested
manning or sulking like tiburi after
the call-down you gave him

  we can get along without him said
hooper weve got plenty to do between
now and sailing-time neither andersen nor
thompson is going to turn in until we get
well away

  for two hours there was the bustle of
departure stowage of provisions general
overhauling arrangement of a space on
deck for steiner and his fifteen men the
mary l would run back under her own
power as long as the gasoline-supply lasted
and hooper for humanitarian reasons as
well as those of general comfort decided
to keep his quasi prisoners where they
would get the full benefit of sun and air
a canvas awning was rigged from foremast
to forestay for their convenience

  hooper had expected some last gifts of
fresh fruit and fish from tiburi but as
eleven oclcok came and the chief still re-
mained within the crater sequestered on
his little beach he resolved to do without
them the dynamite with several of the
sticks halved primed and fused was still
in the stern of one of the two whale-boats
and there was a chance of getting mullet
at the last moment

  on the terrace steiner and his fifteen men
were under guard of holabird white
ryder and smith the boats would be
full coming back and hooper did not want
to make two trips of the job andersen
was left in charge of the schooner with
thompson and mannings three assistants
under him there were also fong and
ling and the invalided edwards with his
sprained ankle it was a strong outfit
four sailors went in each boat as rowers
manning who could handle a steering-
sweep in the stem of one hooper in that
of the other

  again they passed tiburis canoes drawn
up on the beach and again the savages came
down to the waters edge and watched
them but tiburi was not visible his
wounded dignity seemed to demand that
he keep in seclusion

  hell come round at the last minute
said hooper hell guess we are going out
on the ebb once he sees us transporting
steiner and his crowd we havent seen
the last of tiburi not while there is any
trade left aboard the schooner

  it was about three-quarters of a mile
from the crater-gap across the inner lagoon
to the landing below the terrace usually
the guards came to the bottom of the stair-
ways to meet the incoming boats two
guarded each trail they were not visible
and hooper in the leading boat gave the
order to hold water until manning drew up

funny he said screwing his eyes up
at the terrace theres no one in sight
back in the caves suggested manning
or maybe steiner balked at the last minute
and our men are rounding them up

  soon find out replied hooper give
way men

  they bent to the oars and the boats
glided into a narrow channel that led right
through the strip of beach to the largest of
the water-caves this channel bore evi-
dence of having been man-made and the
landing-ledges inside the caves were too
handy to have been entirely accidental
one man was left in each boat still afloat
inside the cave and the party divided
manning going to the left with his three
men and hooper to the right with his

  nothing was said action preempting
words but the impression that something
had gone askew in the arrangements that
the terrace was deserted manifested itself
not only to hooper and manning but in
the sailors the whole party was armed
as usual with rifles and automatics at
the last moment manning on impulse
prompted by the strange silence of the place
carried up with him the box of dynamite

  he thought it possible that steiner and
his men had retreated to some position in
the caves back of the images where they
could make a resistance or better terms
they might have overpowered their guards
he had never underestimated steiner and
the men had been warned to be careful

  the two parties reached the level of the
terrace simultaneously manning peering
no mans island



about the pedestal of a god pistolready
saw hoopers face rising from the trail at
the other end the terrace was deserted
the cooking-utensils that steiner had been
given for his party were in orderly array
ready for transshipment so were the
blankets and a bundle or two of general
dunnage but no sign of steiner his men
or of the four guards only silence broken
by the low plashing of the lagoon surf on
the landing-beach and the steady dripping
of water from the main cave the grass-
thatched shelters were empty

   there were five caves but four of these
 were only gas-blow fissures in the lava rock
 two of them too narrow for a man easily to
 squeeze through all these they probed
 and examined after a preliminary search
 of the big cave that was a bewildering
 labyrinth in its interior it seemed foolish
 to think that steiner had hidden in its
 depths he would have but the smallest
 supply of food and water if any and two
 men could effectually prevent any exit
 unless he figured that the schooner would
 sail away after hooper and manning had
 grown tired of waiting leaving their four
 men which was equally ridiculous and
 would leave steiner within a short time at
 the mercy of tiburi once again

   they gathered on the terrace uncertain
 perplexed

   do you suppose they have discovered
some passage leading up and out on the
slopes hooper asked manning that
would only take them out of our frying-
pan into tiburis fire

   if there was one tiburi would have
known of it and attacked them that way
long ago when you first came here ob-
jected the diver

  perhaps he did we dont know the
details of how he finally did get steiner
i dont like it and i dont quite see what
to do we cant leave the men we cant
leave steiner to be put in that stockade
again confound the man whats he up
 to

   his glance ranged seaward to where they
 could see the schooner between the reefs
 through the gap in the crater walls

  something doing on the beach with
tiburi he said theyre launching the
canoes and theyve got all their weapons
with them theyve been leaving most of
them behind of late manning theres
something stirring that looks fishy to me

  steiner and tiburi in together that 
wouldnt-

  its tiburi anyway said hooper
look at them come not for the schooner
but after us they saw us go in and they
are not going to let us out

  the canoes were forming in line across
the inner lagoon as they gazed from the
terrace they saw them take order and the
spray flash from the paddles and surge
before the prows as they came on at top
speed the canoes fairly bristled with
weapons

  better tackle em here than try to break
through them in the boats said hooper

  manning looked at him from a new angle
of respect only once had he seen hooper
in the offensive when he knocked down
holabird and the conviction was borne
in upon him that holabird was mixed up
in this somehow with edwards for all the
latters lame ankle treachery

now hoopers face was a fighting-
mask set lips firm jaws clenched
the lower jutting out in determina-
tion his nostrils wide and his eyes ablaze
manning did not realize that his own fea-
tures were a replica of his friends

  he saw the folly of trying to run the
gantlet against so many canoes able to
move three times as easily as swiftly
crowded with men who could quill them
with arrows in one discharge

  the two sailors left in charge of the boats
came hurrying up the trail their faces show-
ing their alarm

  there are therest of tiburis canoes
out to sea cried hooper going to
tackle the schooner thevll have a tough
time of it

  tiburi seems to have got over his fear
of the hims all right said manning
grimly as he examined the breech of his
rifle and the clip of his automatic half-
fearful that they had been in some way
tampered with but well put the fear of
us into him before he gets through

  hooper nodded

  steady men he rallied the sailors
we can hold them off from the heads of
the trails manning you take the left
will you dontwaste a shot any one of
you

  two of the men suddenly shrank back-
to the wall of the cliff pointing upward
their faces gray under the tan savage


adventure

yells broke out from above arrows rained
down glancing and shivering on the stone
flags leaping through the bush down the
steep sides of the crater came two score
or more tribesmen brandishing spears and
clubs disappearing behind the leafy screen
to discharge more arrows

  their deafening triumphant din was
echoed from the lagoon where tiburi and
his men the chiefs war-canoe in the center
of the cannibal armada were closing in for
the beach at terrific speed the whites
were caught between two attacks a third
was closing on the schooner white puffs
of smoke showed on her decks the reports
of rifles came floating back to the terrace

  then from the water-cave beneath out
darted the two whale-boats filled with
steiner and his men rowing fast toward
tiburi holabird and the three other
guards were with them not as prisoners
but free a part of the crowd with their
weapons they turned and yelled defiance
at the terrace tiburis flotilla parted to
let them through and they sped on toward
the schooner the oars pulled by the ger-
man sailors tiburis savages yelled greet-
ings to them as they passed the whole
attack had been deliberately planned and
timed steiner tiburi and the four guards
were in collusion for common advantages
edwards too in all probability but he had
funked the fight at the last minute

  why doesnt andersen put to sea cried
hooper he can come back for us

  and then the men from the cliffs were
upon them leaping down on the terrace
yelling like so many demons from the pit
stark naked save for ornaments their filed
teeth showing between their thick lips
drawn back in eagerness their eyeballs
flashing as they rushed wildly to hand-
grips with the whites

  some of them fell before the first fire
the fight became a melee in which the
savages had an advantage with their weap-
ons made for hand-to-hand combat clubs
of hardwood beaked with stone and shell
their skill and strength in handling them
the sailors were beaten back hooper and
manning in the front rank making every
shot of their pistols count in the desperate
fight they had none too many bullets
in a few moments the main attack would
land from the canoes rushing up at their
backs hewing stabbing spearing

  manning flung his empty automatic into

the open mouth of a warrior breaking his
teeth and spoiling the blow he was whirling
down he clubbed his rifle and used it as
a flail smashing furiously with hooper
beside him the attack was so furious
that the cannibals blocked themselves by
their packed formation but sheer weight
told and several of the men were bleeding

  a warrior sprang out and clung to
hoopers uplifted arms swinging his rifle
another thrust athim with a spear that
bristled with sharks teeth and was tipped
with shell mannings rifle-butt came down
upon the skull of the second and shattered
it like a pumpkin spattering blood and
brains as the blow landed a savage sprang
on him with a war-club and manning
kicked him in the knee bringing him down
with a howl of rage clasping at mannings
legs dragging the white man down asprawl

  manning still clutched his rifle in one
hand the warrior was beneath him- striv-
ing to twist uppermost while manning
sought his throat with his left hand then
weight sagged him twining limbs impris-
oned his he was helpless waiting for the
final blow like a trussed ox-unless they
were after him alive

  that thought shot through him in a light- 
ning-flash then the strenuous pressure
above and about relaxed he heaved up
a hand caught him by the elbow and he
stood erect three of the sailors were
down hooper bloody but smiling was
beside him mannings first opponent lay
with his face formless bashed in by the butt
of hoopers gun-another swung an arm
broken at the elbow

  even said hooper panting

  rush em-dynamite rush em a bit
gasped manning

  hooper gave him a look that swiftly
lightened as he took in the meaning

  with a yell that outtopped any native
whoop that carried terror in its deep-
throated heartiness hooper jumped at the
massed ranks of the savages embarrassed
by their own numbers amazed at the re-
sistance of these hard-fighting whites the
sailors still on their feet desperate mad-
dened by thetrap that they were in fol-
lowed their leader and the mob gave sul-
lenly back a foot-a yard--two more past
the base of the biggest statue that leaned
on its pedestal out above the cliff

  beside it  manning had set down his
precious box of explosives as the natives
no mans island



stiffened taking fresh heart at the yells
that came up from below as the canoes
made a dah for the last fifty yards be-
tween them and the beach he snatched out
some of the half-sticks that were ready-
primed he found his matches lighted the
ruffled fuses blowing at them

  back he roared come back

  facing the savages hooper pressed back
his sailors stumbling over the dead and
wounded

  take cover shouted manning and
they leaped aside behind the pedestals
into the main cave while manning flung
two grenades into the thick of the astounded
savages and crouched back of the base of
the great god hurriedly stuffing into a crev-
ice more of the prepared dynamite

  with a roar and a burst of flame the
explosive detonated the wail of the
stricken cannibals blown up crisped torn
apart those unharmed flung flat while the
noise of the blast resounded from the cliff
was merged in a second storm of thunder-
ing noise and darting lightnings manning
racing for cover as flung down stunned
as the terrace shook the base of the great
god rocked the statue toppled and went
hurtling down

  it crashed fairly into the clutter of land-
ing canoes half in the water half on the
beach splintering tiburis own craft the
crown one missile the body and the pedestal
two thunderbolts that crushed bodies to
pulp and turned the peaceful tide crimson

xii

       land sea and air still shook under
the tremendous force of the ex-
ploding gases the savages who
had attacked the terrace and had survived
the explosion were scrambling frantically
back up the cliffs to safety leaving their
broken dead and writhing wounded behind
them tiburi was dead with a score of his
followers the survivors were swimming
frantically off or had crowded into a few
canoes that had not been badly damaged
many clinging to the gunwales and out-
riggers as the paddlers strove to get away
from this place of utter disaster and the
outbreak of the wrath of the gods

  for surely this was a thing of the gods
the gods of the white men the tribe had
long worshiped those enormous images
especially the central figure it had meant

  

nothing to them of actual creed it held no
actual place in their polytheistic pantheon
but they knew it to be the likeness of a god
jmd of a great god now it had been over-
thrown in fire and flame involving them in
its destruction coming to the rescue of the
whites for they could see the whites still
moving on the terrace and had not one of
them flung thundering fiery death among
them

  they held no desire but to flee never
again on that island would the magic of the
white man be questioned or his purposes
thwarted yet steiner had been white and
he had been their ally but he had also
been their prisoner therefore there were
white men who were at odds with the gods
and others high in favor but it would be-
hoove them for the future to hold all white
strangers in awe

  out at sea the savages had heard the rear
and seen the flame- the fragments of tossed
rock and masses of toppling cliff and statues
and their canoes had vanished toward the
safety of their cone and the deep bush

  hooper rushed out before the dust had
settled bounding from the cave where he
had sought cover at mannings shout hurry-
ing to pick up his comrade and partner
fearing that he had sacrificed himself to
save the rest

  manning had seized a handful of dyna-
mite-sticks at the last moment stuffing
fuse and primers in his pocket the bulk
of the explosive still in its box he had
kicked over the cliff before he sought safety
after lighting the fuses from the frightful
force of the discharge it seemed certain that
this too had detonated the blocks on the
terrace were displaced as if by an earth-
quake the cliff below was rent and fissured
every god had fallen from its pedestal
though only the one had toppled over the
cliff a great wave formed rolling in and
then retreating in a surge that bore the
whole and broken canoes away with their
riding clinging freight in confusion

  manning in falling or perhaps before he
fell had rolled the dozen sticks of dynamite
along the terrace ahead of him the force
of the explosion expending itself in the
direction of the greatest resistance had
with the freakishness of nitro-glycerine sent
out lateral blasts of gas and air that had
floored manning but had left the scat-
tered sticks immune saving his life and also
leaving a weapon of deadly offense if anyj


adventure

were still needed for with the exception
of a few shells in the magazines of their
rifles they had used all their ammunition

  manning with his swift purpose and
action doing the only thing that could have
saved them from the horde risking his own
life without thought or fear had not been
killed the explosion had stunned him
flinging him headlong the stone flags had
met his head violently his face was a
bloody mask the clothes had been torn from
his back but hooper as he raised him saw
that he was still breathing heard him
groan and thanked god

  a sailor ran with water from the cave and
tossed it on the face of the unconscious man
racing back for more with which hooper
taking his friends head upon his lap bathed
the bruised features and at last saw man-
nings eyes open intelligent still indomitable
with purpose he smiled up at hooper

  close call-touch and go he said faint-
ly youre safe how about-

  were all safe said hooper huskily
thanks to you and your confounded fool-
hardiness you might have blown yourself
to atoms

  his chiding was full of deep affection of
admiration and it acted like a tonic on
manning

  youve scattered them to the four
winds said hooper those who have
legs left and arms to swim or paddle with
are using them its the end of tiburi

  the schooner asked manning

  he got up with anxious aid of hooper
bathing his face which still bled freely

  im sound he said no bones broken
feel as if id been pounded by a hundred
war-clubs at once ah theyre holding
them off good men

  rifles were spitting from the deck of the
mary l answered from the two whale-
boats in less measure steiner had only the
guns and pistols of the four treacherous
guards and deserted by his savage allies
his attack was failing one or two of his
men in each boat seemed to have been badly
wounded if not killed to judge by their
postures

  got to get out there saidhooper its
a problem three of our chaps are pretty
badly slashed and clubbed dragged them
into the cave when you started the fire-
works that was quick thinking manning

  wed have hard work getting around
the erater-slopes he said and wed have

to swim for it at the last there seems
something wrong with the schooners engine
otherwise i believe andersen would have
put cut to sea to shake off that attack any-
way they cant come in through the second
reef steiners got both our boats dont
imagine theres anything left in the shape
of a canoe but there might be

   he sent a sailor down to the beach to
look and the man came hurrying back with
a shout the big wave had washed two
canoes fairly inside the cave and they were
in fair shape the dazed savages had been
too literally swept off their feet to think of
such a happening they were still paddling
off to the shore at a safe distance from these
white men and their gods who might again
blast them the lagoon was dotted with
the heads of swimmers

   in the two canoes they took up the pad-
 dles hooper and manning assisting to take
 the place of the three wounded sailors
 manning protested that he was whole and
 did not want to get stiff and hoopers heart
 lightened as he saw the diver stroking
 lustily salt water had proved an astringent
 for the abrasions of his face though the
 superficial wounds gave him a grim and
 ghastly appearance

   as they neared the reef two men in each
 canoe paddled while the others took up the
 rifles and the two partners prepared their
 dynamite grenades in case steiner might
 come to close quarters but steiner had
 seen that he was beaten to be left behind
 was now his great fear or that of his men
 the savages recovering from their shock
 would take vengeance before they got
 within true hailing-distance his followers
 were shouting and waving their hands to
 announce their surrender

  hear that called hooper from his
canoe across to manning in the other
kamerad wouldnt wonder if they got
that out of the papers

   manning nodded back he saw steiner
still sullen but overborne by his men he
saw two of the guards protesting and then
silenced

  white and smith the two names took
on sudden illumination weiss and schmidt
undoubtedly ryder too sounded germanic

   as for holabird he had been won over
 t by thetalk of edwards the thought of gain
 it was exceedingly plain that these four men
 had been shipped by the too slick edwards
 for a previously understood purpose
no mans island



  the attempt to cozen the sailors to mutiny
having failed edwards with his tricks f
magic his knowledge of dialects had seen
his chance to win over tiburi to effect a
junction with steiner a partnership to be
variously apportioned its rewards and
they had accorded him full facility he
had taken off provisions to the terrace his
four men were in daily contact with steiner
edwards had had ample opportunities to
cement the alliance with tiburi and he
had overcome tiburis fear of the hims
how was not yet plain

  edwards had faked his ankle to remain
on board and put the engine out of com-
mission it was not cowardice that kept
him there perhaps-manning remembered
the wireless incident-perhaps the chapter
was not yet quite closed

      hooper steered straight for the
     i schooner and manning followed

     	all firing had ceased from the whale-
boats the men in them hung on their oars
looking anxiously toward the mary l de-
bating their fate dreading to be left behind

  andersen and thompson met them at the
gangway mannings assistants carried the
wounded men below they had been tem-
porarily patched up and none of them ap-
peared seriously wounded beyond ultimate
recovery

  we held them off sir said andersen
one or two flesh-wounds but we potted
some of them and now theyve quit
afraid you were blown up till we made you
out in the canoes goin to leave them here
where they belong on no mans island
he jerked a thumb toward the two boats
no said hooper fheyll come
along we need the boats for one thing
were you trying to stand by andersen or
is the engine out of commission

  that sly devil edwards did something
to it put in thompson lings over-
hauling it now to find out the trouble and
edwards was monkeying with the wire-
less

  i thought so said manning

  hooper glanced at his partner with raised
eyebrows that borea mute apology

fong had the right dope manning he
said then to thompson where is he
in his bunk fong sliced him up pretty
badly and now hes trying to keep him alive
till you talk with him

  ill go see him said hooper coming

manning andersen let those chaps in the
boats stew for a while if they start to show
fight settle it they wont run away i
fancy and the natives wont bother us
any more soon as ling gets the engine
fixed let me know want to come along
thompson

  they found edwards in his bunk it
was plain to see that he was dying his
eyes were closed and his-face waxen fong
sat beside him sphinx-like hooper felt the
faint pulse

  almost gone he said what hap-
pened fong

  after you go said fong ling he find
him at wiless lang think that funny
edwad he speak his foot plenty betteh
ling speak why fo he touch wiless
edwad say that none of ling business
he speak maybe we want use wiless ling
he come to my galley

  bimeby native come in canoe two boat
come with steineh big fight look like
begin andersen he speak staht engine
engine nu good i sabby plenty that
edwad he fixee on deck plenty gun go
off same from boat i find edwad sneakee
along in cabin he open pot makee signal

he try shoot me this time he not so-

slick he had gun i have knife all right
gun no good knife plenty good so

  he drew his forefinger across his abdomen
with an eloquent gesture

  pretty soon he die he said

  fong go and get my medicine-chest
said hooper ill try and bring him back
he went on to manning and thompson
when the chinaman had gone weve got
to get to the bottom of this

  he gave edwards a hypodermic and pres-
ently the lax figure stirred wearily and the
eyes opened manning gave the stewardfa
sip of gin luster came into the dull eyes

  youve done your worst edwards
said hooper and youve lost out youre
going yourself i dont want to torture
you i cant save you do you want to
carry this thing on with you-to wherever
you are going-or do you want to try and
square things a bit

  the dying man lay motionless except for
the slight movement of his eyes

ill tell you some things while i last
he said finally his voice was low his
speech jerky but intelligent and he was
evidently striving to conserve his strength
nor could there be doubt of his final


adventure

earnestness or the truth of what he said

  butler had me-where he wanted me
knew you had something perhaps guano
perhaps pearls got me to ship with four
lunas-all work for butler he got them
jobs as lunas that schooner seamew-
not huddersleighs belongs to butler
has wireless butler aboard her soon as
you started engine and set straight course
i sent message she followed now two
hundred miles away i sent another mes-
sage-today telling what happened i
thought wed win for sure

  he paused for a while and they thought
he had passed but he rallied again

  i think-at first-when find out what
you were after-get crew to join with my
four men-take possession send message
for sewmew to come crew did not join
you were too strong i talk with steiner
and tiburi tiburi to have everything in
traderoom many things from this ship
steiner and men to take mary l for their
share butler to take me and my men
along-with pearls big money for us-
pearls for butler-and he destroy evidence
against me he holds

  and us if we were not killed what of
us

  butler would say

how did you manage to make tiburi
not afraid of the hims asked manning

  edwards eyelids were fluttering he was
at the last ebb of life he opened his eyes
again and there was the ghost of a twinkle
in them as they bent to hear the whisper
that was his last breath

  showed-him diving-suit-empty-in
your cabin he said

       the mary l her engine working
again stood north and west to meet
the summoned seameiv edwards
had not tried permanently to destroy the
engine by agreement doubtless with steiner
he had broken ignition wires in the insula-
tion which once located were easily re-
placed

  behind the schooner towed the two whale-
boats with steiner and his followers the
dead had been buried at sea among them
were holabird and white-or weiss-shot
from the deck of the mary l edwards
went with them to their deep-sea graves

  at nightfall the prisoners were brought
aboard and put in the forecastle with the
hatch secured dawn should show them

the seamew with butler aboard coming up
for his triumph that he had not cal-
culated upon such a fighting termination
of the trip was no excuse for his planning
of it yet it was doubtful if he could be
found responsible he was wealthy and
powerful he could easily disclaim any
knowledge of the german prisoners he
could throw the blame upon edwards and
discredit what ryder and smith who had
received their orders direct from edwards
might testify

  edwards confession was only oral it
would not hold for much in any court
clever lawyers could bar its admission with-
out trouble

  but hooper and manning talking these
things over were not disposed to let the
matter end in siith fashion to get butler
aboard the mary l was the big problem
he would expect communication by wire-
less and none of them could operate ed-
wards might have agreed upon some signal
which he had failed to communicate on his
death-bed butler would probably scruti-
nize closely the decks of the mary l when
the two vessels got close certain as he
might be from edwards message when the
fight was on that everything had gone well
for his side yet he would be careful

  in mid-morning they sighted the seamew
coming up under power the combined
speed of the two vessels swiftly reduced
the distance and then hooper displayed
a signal he had decided to take the chance
that edwards had not sent a detailed mes-
sage and had not mentioned the fact that
the crew had failed to join the conspiracy
at the time of sending the combined attack
appeared invincible hooper manning and
the sailors were cooped up on the terrace
the canoes were closing in and edwards
had counted his chickens before the shells
were fairly cracked but butler would be
cautious

  only three sailors showed on deck of the
mary l one at the wheel her ensign
was at half-mast the signal-halyards showed
this fluttering appeal-

  send medical assistance

  i figure theres no doctor aboard the
seamew said hooper butler will think
there are badly wounded aboard he will
imagine edwards himself hurt and it may
bringhim off it may not if he doesnt
bite well pake for honolulu and wait his
return
no mans island



  the seamew came up slowed down within
speaking-distance an officer appeared with
a megaphone		v

  whats the trouble he shouted a
sailor coached for the occasion by hooper
who with thompson and manning stood
under the hood of the companionway un-
seen answered

  seamew ahoy send some one to dress
wounds

  another figure appeared beside the first
on the after deck of the seamew he did
not turn his full face toward the mary l
but they recognized butler in blue serge
with the peak of his cap well down the
two consulted

  whos in charge called the officer

  mr edwards sir he was badly hurt
wants to see mr butler think hes dying
sir

  there was another consulation and then
with the mary ls way stopped the two
schooners drifting slowly closer a boat put
out from the seamew and the trio on the
companion ladder rejoiced

  manning and hooper received the
astounded butler in the after cabin emerg-
ing from the staterooms after he was seated
the interview was short and to the point

  i know nothing of all this declared
butler edwards had no instructions from
me i was going to fannings island on my
own business that can be shown i
picked up a wireless message that interested
me cruising farther south i got another
it was evidently a part of some infernal
conspiracy hatched up by you men to at-
tempt to implicate me you tried to get
me interested in some wild scheme in
honolulu hooper if you are hooper i
didnt fall for it and you cooked this up
edwards was doubtless in it

  the mans cool effrontery was matchless
but hooper only laughed

  we fancied youd deny it all mr but-
ler but we could put a pretty good case
together i think lets talk business

  butler considered a moment with frown-
ing brows

  what is your proposition he asked

  weve talked it over mr manning and
myself i want to make you a sleeping part-

ner in this enterprise of ours which was to
recover the pearls ouf of my own schooner
weve got the pearls-got them all but
the schooner is a loss and the expenses
were heavy

  where are your pearls

  as a sleeping partner you will not
awaken sufficiently to partake ef the prof-
its said hooper smoothly we may show
them to you but we feel that you should
reimburse us for the costs of this voyage and
for the loss of the schooner

  you are a lot of-pirates burst out

butler ill see you hanged first

  as you like said hooper but if
you will give us a check for ten thousand
dollars release the bonds against the mary
l and turn over to mr manning and my-
self the seamew as a testimonial of your
esteem we will consider the incident closed
we have no especial desire to be tied up in
honolulu as you might be able to do we
are not pirates or we might maroon you
edwards has paid the penalty as things
turned out he went farther than you in-
tended but-we are prepared to spend
half of what we have recovered in pinning
this thing to you-and we think we can do
it we have witnesses and a good deal of
evidence when it is summed up it is up
to you you may have to pay ryder and
smith to hold their tongues no one of us is
seriously injured or we would not com-
pound

  there was silence in the cabin for several
minutes

  youll supplement that check with a
note promising not to have it estopped
said hooper i am beginning to doubt
whether the amount is large enough after
all and include a bill of sale for the
seamew

  its plain blackmail said butler but
ill submit to it

  thought you would answered hooper
fong bring some refreshments

  piracy said butler once more later
when the deal had been completed in the
cabin of the seamew

  finance said manning never could
see much difference between the two my-
self
author of the rawhiders 

 think i grunted the sight was
sufficient at least to startle me for it
was no more nor less than captain
zachary thorm zigzagging toward the
hotel in the wicked tugging wind and laugh-
ing great roaring guffaws to himself i could
not hear the laughter for the wind but i saw
his movements and his wild face and in
the second instant i saw what he carried-a
dressed pig gripped by the hind legs in
each hand

  pigs and laughter in that wind my
mouth went dry with fear and my nerves
prickled	

  well they might for as with the flood
forty days so the wind had blown forty days
and forty nights until our mortal nerves
were on edge the burros loafing to the
leeward of the hotel would start and run at
a shoe-sole being smacked down on the
boardwalk and a burro appears to be the
most stolid of animals a ranchman dared
not hitch up a team of horses for their skins
were sore to the harness from the hair being
constantly blown and roughed we were
all victims of the ever shifting but never
ending pressure

  i opened the door for laughing zach and
when he slipped hurriedly through i leaned
my weight against it to close it on the wind
he swung up first one pig then the other and
slammed them down across the dusty hotel
register on the desk

ho-ho-ho he roared mirthlessly his
eyes jumping everywhere john simeon
i want a banquet cooked a banquet for
 this is an ojj-the-trail s

trail of the chosen four etc

all the adults of the town sir do you hear
tonight tonight tonight

  but- i stammered in profound amaze-
ment for laughing zach though rich as
croesus was a recluse the strange man of
the village

  wad em into your dining-room until
they pop out o the windows he roared on
his eyes jumping from floor to chair to wall
to desk and back and forth like a cat
ive a tale to tell em and a farewell to say
for ive a journey ahead o me

  a tale a journey i repeated in my
stupidity

 in a lifetime he had been no farther from
the village than to ride over the near-by
ranges buying cattle in all my twenty
years as his neighbor i had heard it whis-
pered he feared to go beyond the hori-
zon

  a journey yes he confirmed and a
tale with the march wind in it and death and
destruction and lost years-and pink pig to
swallow it with ha-ha-ha

  he chuckled up and down the scale with
his empty mirth

   but the wind captain i remonstrated
the people wont come out theyre all
half-daffy now

  a little of the madness left him and he
looked at me in appeal

  herd em in-john-somehow get
em in by hook or crook i must have em
here before i go and go i must and go i will
youve been my friend john listen ill
sit at the head o the board like an earl and
ry see first contents page

the wind



well break bread and be merry for tomor-
row i go away well talk and sing and ill
astonish em with a yarn-

  there is one yarn i began i won-
der-

  ah landlord thats it go out and tell
em captain zachary thorm once o the
army will spin the yarn that he can spin-
the yarn quincy hodges has been daring me
to spin for twenty years-or thirty years
then theyll come theyll come if the
wind rises to blowing crags off the moun-
tains

  zachary i said licensed by the friend-
ship bpreen us youd better give up this-

unusual idea and-

  nay nay you old botherer go out o
here and hire all the mexicans who can cook
food and all who can wait politely on table
and buy a coop o fowls and things in cans
and barrels and boxes at the store and get
coffee and canisters o tea and well have a
least to remember

  ive nobody to send out to tell the peo-
ple i expostulated still demurring and
on the last syllable thought of a messenger
i might send quincy though

  no other hell not fail to get em all
not he a-hoppin along on his metal foot
and will i ask quincy in too

  aye everybody quincy too all the
he-gossips and the she-gossips to spread the
news

  be careful of your talk i advised
careful i bonded myself a quarter of a
century ago john to talk now to make res-
titution to certain dead men

  all at orice he shuddered and his red
weather-beaten face paled a little his eyes
began to go again and he threw back his
head in the mirthless laughter he broke
in with a clumsy dance in his high-heel cow-
country boots and smacked a sheaf of bills
down on the desk

  thats to pay for my night o nights my
night o nights with the wild wind setting
the tune

  he started up a song in a broken bass-
oh im as happy as a bridegroom a bride-
groom for on the morrow i go away go
away

  he flung open the door then shoved it
shut and turned back

  do you know what night it will be to-
night friend landlord

  the fortieth night of the wind f the
babies know that

  - man themad regiment of cav-
alry and the dead soldiers that other for-
tieth night-

   he began to sing horribly-

  when i was a young captain a young
captain oh when i was a young cap-
tain-

   he fled out into the wind crying laughter
 that was not laughter but the agony of a
 man who has not found that there is peace in
 god

   not understanding his seclusion or his
 loud and mocking laughter and his fits of
 despondency and his silent lips we half-
 laughed at him-never to his face-and
 called him laughing zach our friendship
 his and mine was only comparative some-
 times he took a meal in my dining-room or
 talked a minute at a time about some earlier
 day acquaintance or mayhap i gave him
 a warm word at christmas

  and then he had a curious habit that
threw us together some in the summer-time
in each june when the southwest texas
weather had become cheery in the high
mountains he would come to my hotel and
spend two weeks pretending one season
that he was visiting in washington d c
another season that he was in yellowstone
park or possibly in new york or london
all the time he would read books and
pamphlets about the places and force the
talk about them to me

   i tried to help him with his illusions-for i
 knew that he sometimes went to the top of
 old blue and spent a day to catch sight of a
 southern pacific train going from new
 orleans to the golden coast or from the far
 west to the mellow south the trains at
 that distance of fifteen miles or so from the
 mountain could be seen for hours like a
 passing ship from a headland he wanted-
 he sort of itched to travel and it was not
 in my heart to discourage his make-believe
 but he never talked about the dark thing
 that a few of the old gray heads hinted at

  and the banquet-i humored him i
carried the two pink pigs back to the old
mexican housekeeper and laid long tables
in the big bam of a dining-room and kindled
a roaring fire in the mammoth fireplace

when quincy hodges came
around with his twisted foot and
metal brace and i told him what
was in the air he cocked one eye and looked
at me hard 


adventure

  whats he aimin to tell he asked
curiously

  none of my business i said but if
youre not going to take the stage out to the
railroad today you might go around and tell
the people theyll appreciate it having
been coopcd in at home so long

  theyll predate it quincy reiterated
because therll be gossip their ears have
been cocked for ever since-since its been
noticeable thorm never leaves us-twenty
years or so

  youll tell them

  sure i couldnt get out with the motor-
truck in this wind itll stop a car on the

crest of the little pass i wonder-

  his eyes clouded his crooked calloused
hands fumbled each other

  he wont back out eh

  but without waiting for an answer he got
up and stood by the door an instant before
opening it and passing into the gale

  id trade my wages for a jug o whisky
that was the big fault with quincy he
was always doing just that thing the town
had grown used to him on his whisky
nights standing for hours at laughing
zachs gate and baiting the captain in a
loud voice to come out and talk and tell
what he knew they two had been soldiers
together in that regiment of frontier cav-
alry that went mad in one wild mad instant
-thorm a captain and hodges a private
there was a secret between them that we
knew nothing of and were afraid to guess at

  as the windy day wore on i saw hodges
going from house to house bent against the
gale holding his battered hat on with first
one hand then the other meantime warm-
ing the idle member in his trousers pocket
it seemed he would freeze for the one but-
ton on his coat let the lapels blow back
so that the acidy wind smote his breast
he had forgotten to wear the heavy coat
that he used on the stage trips to the railroad

  the most we knew of thorm was that he
counted his cattle by the herds and his gold
by the hatsful and that he had not spent a
night off his own mattress in thirty-one
years he would never venture beyond
sight of the village church steeple he
would laugh his boisterous evasive coura-
geous laugh and answer that he loved his own
pillow best but it only made the people
whisper more that he feared the law or man
or woman or mayhap god somewhere be-
yond the horizon

  the captains night was to begin with
darkness the sun went down in a clear
and windy sky with golden wisps of fleecy
clouds scurrying over the far mountain-
peaks i saw an eagle that had been trying
to fly against the west wind half the day to
reach its cliff still maneuvering it would
go high high up rest a while then try to
coast down or drop as a plummet but each
time when it touched the surf of the wine
blowing up from the cliff-face it was throwj
aside to the eddies

  quincy was the first to be there except for
two old ranchmen from the country ha
found a place by the window where he could
see the captain coming at the proper time
and established himself in brooding silence
the sun was no more than gone when the
entire town seemed to come in together i
soon saw that every man and woman not
under the doctors tyranny was there and
a wind-worn lot they were

  the women talked in high screeching
voices and started or screamed smotheredly
each time that a sheet of tin roofing over
the comer where we sat that had come loose
that day was lifted by the wind and thrown
down with a bang

 those women were haggard with the
nerve-strain of the wind that blew and never
ceased

  the men with the dust of weeks driven
into their skin and face-wrinkles put in their
time wondering if the gale would ever die
or recounting in snatches the known history
of thorms career in that country only
four of them all had been there longer than
he also they talked of his big ranches and
his shrewdness in buying the white-face cat-
tle quincy broke his silence to mutter once-
he aint in sight yet

  darkness covered the land the two big
front rooms were lighted steaming plat-
ters were set upon the white linen i began
unconsciously to listen for thorms wild
laughter the men walked the floor every-
body grew restless with the waiting then
a woman said querulously-

  wont he never come

  upon the echo of her question the door
flung open and laughing zach plunged in

 -and- he roared the terror of

the morning still a-hold of him wont it
never stop

  he glared- around realized us and a
change came over him he magically re-
vealed a new man to us in himself he threw
the wind



back an ancient blue military cape display-
ing the yellow lining of the cavalry a bright
jangling sword and the blue dress uniform
with the wide stripe of a captain at the
trouser seams-all time-stained and crease-
worn

  but it was his face we watched it
changed to a benevolent countenance with
a beaming kindliness and his gray eyes soft-
ened and filled with tears-the first tears i
warrant that had flooded his lids in thirty
years then he brightened more

  welcome each and every one of you
he cried out welcome neighbors to my
farewell dinner

  he spread out his great arms and herded
us toward the dining-room quincy to
avoid being touched by the shepherding
arm shoved into the crowd and got
ahead

  the old soldier took his place at the head
of the table big and commanding and di-
rected us to our chairs when his eyes
glanced around and found hodges at the
other end of the head table opposite him-
self he said-

  ah

  here big as life leered quincy ears
cleaned to hear your speech

  for the time that he could pick up a glass
of water and set it down again without
drinking laughing zach was panicky
then he spoke softly

  be peaceful quincy my fellow towns-
men have never broken bread with me in the
thirty-one years i-i wish them to before
i go

  hodges answer was a rattling of his metal
brace against a chair but thorm ignored
him and beamed upon us again in the man-
ner of a man proud to have his neighbors at
his board he jestedand ran on with merry
wit that astonished us playing the olden
earl indeed at first i tell you we forgot
ourselves and the wind that sucked and roared
in the fireplace in our marveling over this
revelation of a man hodges mumbled and
broke in but somehow we did not pay him
heed but basked in the cheer of our host

  it was the pent-up host desire of a quarter
of a century that made him affable beyond
belief if we enjoyed it and we did i must
say that our enjoyment was a dull occasion
corripared to the happiness that he extracted
neighbors in to dinner it was that to him
with all it meant to his starved friendliness
neighbors he thrilled over the word

  everything fades but the love of god and
before we wanted it to be so the table was
cleared and captain zachary thorm faced
that moment after dessert when a word a
speech is next the dread of the morning
crept in again his eyes began to dart
afraid sneered the stage-driver

  no and zachs eyes came sharp up
ive been in the clutch of dead men too
long to fear the living

  nevertheless his words belied his actions
or his courage was of short duration for
again he ran the scale of his mirthless laugh-
ter  laughter that plucked at our nerves like
an unseen hand in the dark and sent awful
thrills across our fears

  hodges jumped to his feet and pointed
out a finger

  what dead he demanded
thorm did not answer he gripped up a
handful of table-cloth unknowing and with
his right hand drew a folded document from
an inside pocket as he pressed it into my
hands he bent to my ear and whispered-
give this to quincy after i am gone
what dead hodges demanded again
pounding on the table with his glass tumbler
tell em thorm tell em ive been waiting
a lifetime to hear you talk name the dead
murderer

thorm extended a shaking arm
in the direction of the old garrison
now adobe ruins that lay a mile
north of where we were assembled

  i came here for that purpose hodges
he declared to name the dead neighbors
that died that other time when the wind
blew forty days and forty nights and a regi-
ment of horse went mad

  hodges shouted to the guests excitedly
youre hearing the straight of it that
other night-that other night

  thirty-one years ago lacking a brace o
weeks thorm said i was to wait till the
anniversary but this fortieth night of the

wind drove me on the colonel--

  thats it begin at the first dont
skip hodges shouted

  the colonel turned the regiment out of
their beds at midnight in the midst of the
wind to drill the recruits in hustling out for
indian attacks the mescalero apaches-

the wind-

dont stammer that wail explain
that wail hodges hammered the table
we were wild with the wind the old


adventure

i

officer went on visibly collecting and hold-
ing his thought

  i nodded to a mexican to throw more red
oak into the fireplace a woman emitted a
long quivering sigh and her husband stirred
in sympathy i myself felt that if thorm
didnt hurry along i should have to rise and
pace the floor

  that very day he said at last was a
climax of days we saw an officers wife
put into the el paso stage destined for a
sanitarium-her nerves shattered the gales
had howled up from the coahuilan desert
and down from the staked plains a-chasing
dust-clouds and pulling at our coats and
screeching past the windows until we
couldnt think straight no rain no new
people no white-covered tables with sane
womens eyes sparkling no books no si-
lence-always the screech of the wind curs-
ing soldiers with grit kneaded into their
skins empty land these black ruins of an-
cient mountains a longing to be somewhere
else and all our days in a post made o dobe
-mud every man came to hate his
neighbor-

  you did hodges blared out and took
up the tale himself horses were tuned up
tight as fiddle-strings on this night the call
to arms sounded ragged and scary in that
gale we-

  tell it all tell it all admonished
thorm i was officer of the day and didnt
have to assemble with you in response to the
call i was walking about at my nights in-
spection i went to the telegraph office on
the hillside above the parade-ground i
paced back and forth in the shelter and
watched the regiment form

  i was stable guard quincy took up the
instant thorm paused fof breath i hur-
ried to help my troop out a-cursin the
colonel for soundin the call on such a night
the men were as wild as the horses and
shouting oaths at every oath and trumpet-
blare the mounts would rear and lunge i
never saw a madder scene in any drunken
dream we got em after a while into some
sort of line across the parade-ground
a-

  i had been cursing department orders
that kept me in such a hell zach broke in
on my days duty i let hate get hold o my
heart there by the telegraph office i stood
and cursed the uniform and the men my
comrades and suddenly i hated the regi-
ment i hated myself the idea-

  then a trumpeter sounded attention
quincy went on with his thread of the tale

  weaving a blanket they were between
them that was covering all of us in such sus-
pense that we scarcely breathed zach was
high in emotion glorified by the fulfilment
of confession i thought hodges was re-
membering an old occasion that had stuck
to him like a burr

  then a trumpeter sounded attention
quincy hurried on his eyes flaming with
memory the line of horses straightened
out and for the snap of your finger they
were quiet and still-no more motion than

a dead mans breath thorm-

  tell it all thorm admonished i was
officer of the day i didnt have to as-
semble with you for this midnight drill i
had other duty but i was idle for the mo-
ment and i paced back and forth by the tel-
egraph officer and cursed my comrades and
the regiment i watched the regiment
form it was a scene there in the windy
moonlight-horses milling rearing-men
shouting bugles screaming-i cursed it all

  the idea came to me that the earth
ought to split open there on the parade-
ground and let them all slip into hell the
thought crowded out my sense of logic i
think for a moment my mind was in eclipse
then the line of horsemen straightened out
and was as motionless as a dead mans
breath

  and a-twangin like a fiddle-string ready
to snap hodges breathed

  and then-then thorm said more
gravely than ever a voice with the devil in
it rose wild and high in a wicked and long-
drawn call-the wail of a mad ghost in a
graveyard

  my mount began to quiver said the
old soldier of the line the horses gasped
in their startled wheezing breaths as if to
command they reared or turned or plunged
-wild and broken and scattered by that
wail as ai clod is crushed and scattered by
your fingers

  i know i saw them cried thorm
they plunged out of ranks they began
to run pell-mell they collided with one
another i heard the impacts i heard
bones break they trampled men they
diunged their riders and themselves into
adobe walls and against the great black
boulders below the chffs some horses
missed these traps and got into the open
range dragging limp men from stirrups
the wind



 the tally o dead men ran to twenty-eight
 youre forgettin hodges flared
 youre forgettin mention of the crip-
 ples he stamped his metal brace upon
 the floor

   thorm mopped his gray face with a fresh
 white handkerchief

   you talk about goin away the stage-
 driver sneered captain de zentin was
  found with the dead

 his horse plunged him to death in arms
 reach of me zach confessed in his quaver-
 ing old voice broken now so that it tugged
  at our hearts i saw his white face turned
 upward in the moonlight

   he was going away the next day thorm
 -de zentin was him and his wife and
 two little girls that used to wear white
 frocks and blue ribbons they were going
 to omaha where there would soon be green
 grass and civilization it was his talk for a
 month beforehand he commanded my
 company and your shout killed him
 thorm stammered that this was true-
 true

   there was forrest hodges went on re-
 lentlessly leaning on his left hand upon the
 table and gesturing accusingly now and
 then with his right forrest was a private
 in my troop hed been hoardin to get
 money to go to paris when his time was up
 -go to paris and study art he made pic-
 tures-good pictures of soldiers and wagons
 and indians they found him dragged life-
 less on the rocks

   sergeant francis too tall and thin
 and straight and just he was ordered to
 fort sam houston but there was an ord-
 nance sergeant with a sick wife and francis
 stepped aside and let that other man go
 but francis was to go next-but they found
 him-trampled loyal to duty a-holding
 three bridle reins in each hand where he was
 trying to quiet the animals

   all of them wanted to get away from
 that wind thorm the same as you this
 wind this time aint so bad in forty days as
 it was then because this is home to all you
 people but them others are out there yet
 thorm and you talk about leaving
 quincy pleaded the captain quincy
 when the colonel couldnt find the man
 who cried out hodges went on cruel now
 it seemed he assembled what was still left
 on duty of the regiment and he went around
 to them and said god would reveal the man
 that caused the accident he assembled

 em close by the hospital porch thorm so
 some of the sounder sick and injured men
 could get out and be examined too

  lookin out of the hospital window i
could see some of em-could see you and
when the colonel spoke to you i knew you
was the one the colonel could have
known too if he hadnt been angry and
after all misdoubtin of god but i saw
and knew your eyes scringed

  but i said then hodges thorm cried
out in protest i said in that instant that i
would make restitution-no no not that-
would punish myself for my crime i set
myself the task of staying out here one year
for each man who died staying almost as
close to my house as they were staying to
the grave then i resolved to add three
years more for the injured and i have
stayed now-

there was silence for a little time
until hodges spoke

how you expecting to get to the
railroad tomorrow quincy demanded sus-
piciously

  i have been depending on you going out
quincy

  hodges shook his head grimly i
wouldnt go out in this wind for-even to get
the doctor

  quincy pleaded thorm forgetful of
his audience you are the only man in town
who has a car that can be put through the
gale of little pass you wouldnt disap-
point me it wouldnt do you any good
quincy man ive stayed my thirty-one
years

  a new voice spoke up ill take you
out it said if you will go tonight i
think my car could make it through at
night the wind isnt so terrible then
no no thorm protested i cant go
tonight when i promised myself i would
give a banquet and assemble the people i
said i would heap the measure full like a
bushel of oats heaped high and running over
ill spend this night out there in the old fort

among the graves of those i slew with-

  that wail hodges broke in

  that wail thorm broke out in agony
when the wind blows the wail is in my

ears always the wind and the wail --

em when the wind rattles my window it
is the wail trying to get in and chill me the
wail and the wind and hell it was the wind 
that drove me wild-that has-

adventure

  he paused as if reminded of something
his expression changed and he shouted out
in a new voice

  but i am free now tomorrow i go
away away away

  in the silence that came as sweet music a
womans voice asked gently-

  where

  to washington he thrilled to my
countrys capital first to see the great
domed structure and the white house and
washingtons monument and all the rest of
that great city and i shall go to all the
pleasant places of the world he continued
to egypt to see the sphinx that has been
more patient than me and to rome and the
alps and to the holy land to see the mount
o calvary where-good-by my neighbors
farewell my friends i go now for the vigil
with those who stay behind

  sobbing openly laughing zach the blus-
terer took up his moth-eaten cape lined
with yellow silk and strode from the room
while we sat and thyaght after him

  when the front door closed behind him i
rose and said quietly to the guests that i
would follow after my friend to see that no
harm of the night or the wind befell him
but when i was donning my overcoat in the
front room hodges joined me and said
grimly that he would go also

  by the time we were wrapped for the out-
side the crowd of guests had pushed into the
front office we slipped out and turned into
the road captain thorm was ahead quite
visible in the moonlight with his long cape
blowing out ahead and seeming to wave and
beckon to us to hurry on

  i love the wind the prairie gales whis-
pered in my ears when i was born and sang
me to sleep in a sod house in my youth in
the northern pacific seas the winds drone
has made me dream of castles in spain and
i have breathed the breath of living life un-
der its icy song in the dakotas i have
listened to its maidenly enchantments on
southern shores it has sung of god of
life of love to me it is a musician who
lends more ecstasy than a thousand harps
can make me feel

  the love of the music of the wind has
grown upon me with my graying hair and i
have acquired the habit of walking abroad
at night when the breezes stir listening to
the tales they whisper in the grass like wa-
terfowl so the paths were not difficult for
me to follow as we kept after laughing zach

  he fought on steadily toward the old fort
sometimes clouds of dust sweeping along
like the smoke of battle came between us
and once after a curtain had blown aside we
saw the old officer running as if he dared to
lose no more of the night

  presently he passed over the shoulder of
the hill beyond which was the ruin of the
old mud garrison he passed from our
sight among great boulders of the desolate
old camp ground

  of a sudden hodges clutched my arm and
cried-

  whats that

  his eyes were protruding and he gazed
back over the way we had come for an
instant i feared to turn my head-afraid of
what i should see when i mustered cour-
age and turned i beheld coming after us a
procession scattered out garments waving
in the wind a troop of black and silent
ghosts they seemed

  the fools stormed my companion
harshly whv couldnt they have stayed
back

  a roman holiday i thought then
changed my opinion for i had seen tears in
their eyes back at table and knew their
hearts were warm for the old man their
neighbor in his hour of torment

  quincy and i went on not waiting and
made our way among the great black boul-
ders on the hillside until we reached the
spot where the old telegraph office had stood
a little of the adobe walls were still visile-
but almost tramped flat by the footsteps of
time it was best we thought for sake of
the old officers private vigil among the
graves beyond to go no farther we were
in a sufficiently commanding position to
maintain a watchful eye in his behalf
we made out the flapping cape here and
there as its owner wandered among the
ruins in the white moonlight of the storm-
blown night

  somehow the journey reminded me f the
wearied flight of the eagle-endless struggle
it almost seemed that i could make out the
bird high above the cliffs

  as hodges and i watched the other guests
assembled among the rocks behind us lean-
ing against the boulders or sitting on them
or crouched in their shelter their white
faces were turned in our direction their
dark garments flapped they were silent it
was like a party of spirits and i wished the
light of day would come
the wind



thorm kept on his winding
 course among the crumbling build-
 ings following the path perhaps
 that he had laid that night when this old
 army post was a living sentinel on the trail
 to yuma after a time we saw him pause
 as if stopped by a man at his side then he
 walked rapidly toward the old headquar-
 ters structure he entered was out of sight
 a minute came out ran toward the guard-
 house before the little structure he ges-
 ticulated and i was certain i caught a wisp
 of his voice on the wind

    hes talking to the sergeant of the guard
  again like he must have done that other
  night hodges whispered to me hes
  acting out that other night like a play

   thorm walked away from the guard-
 house looking back as if watching the guard
 turn out and form then he began to stroll
 as officers of the day do he turned out of
 the parade-ground crossed a street turned
  in back of officers row he passed behind
 the houses was out of our sight for a while
 then he appeared at the other end of the
 line and began to climb the hill toward us

    he found his journey difficult for the
  wind-currents beatand eddied around the
  boulders with the wickedness of an ocean
  surf he struggled up the hill however
  toward the telegraph office stopping fre-
  quently to look out over the parade-ground

    he sees the regiment forming i said to
  my companion who nodded

   presently thorm was between the dim
 trace of the telegraph office wall and the
 boulders a short way beyond which we were
 half-concealed he began to pace back and
 forth vexedly stopping each time at the end
 of his beat to look down into the quadran-
 gular parade he began to walk more rap-
 idly to look more sharply toward his vision
 of the confused troops and all the while
 he muttered

   the white faces of the onlookers back of
  us never wavered

    then for a full minute the captain gazed
  down below at the parade so full of life for
  him he turned back stooped as if peering
  into the window of the telegraph office-that
  had been gone for twenty years-and rais-
  ing glanced about in all directions

    that wail was premeditated quincy
 whispered excitedly

    no i said it is mad cunning his
 caution look now how excited he is

    thorm was glancing about quick in his

movements tensed once more he looked
down below he seemed to see the regi-
ment when the bugle brought the horses to
a standstill he raised up on his toes he
threw back his head and he gave voice to an
unhuman scream that sent our scalps
a-prickling as it droned away on the wind-
high and undulating and weird that scream
of mental agony

  he watched seeing again the panic he had
wrought once he said in a low agitated
and awed voice-

 whoa whoa

  then one of the tragedies of that old
night occurred again to him and in a sud-
den shock of awakening and remorse he
dropped to his knees in a praying-attitude
and groaned and cried out in repentance

  when quincy and i rose those faces be-
hind us rose also and turned and went
away we went until we could catch only
a wisp of his praying words now and then on
the waves of the gale and we waited until
he was silent when we stole back he was
going down the hill and we followed until
he reached the graves of the twenty-eight
snugged away in a cove of hospital canon

  he went to each mound and stood there a
moment sometimes speaking words as if in
benediction he kept on among them stroll-
ing pausing until daylight was abroad and
even then showed no signs of leaving that
he might not see us quincy and i returned
to the hotel

  there were embers still in the great fire-
place that some settler before my day had
built and we sat down to thaw some of the
chill from our bones as we stretched our
hands to the warmth i remembered the pa-
per that thorm had given me perhaps i
was premature but i passed it on to hodges

  he read it and passed it back with a curi-
ous expression upon his face when i
looked i saw that it was a deed properly
executed giving the herd-o-mustangs
ranch to quincy hodges it was thorms
greatest landholding

after that i dozed i must have
slept in that deep chair for i started
up at a confusion of sound it was
eight oclock there were voices and
trampings in the office and on the porch i
hurried out and i found that a dozen of our
townsmen-in truth all the men of the vil-
lage not urgently occupied-had come out to
bid laughing zach farewell


adventure

  will quincy take him i asked the first
words i spoke

  in answer one of them pointed across the
bare plaza to the garage and there i saw
quincy starting our way with his mail-
truck in a moment he roared up to the
hotel porch and stopped

  presently we saw thorm come from his
house we watched and speculated in low
voices among ourselves while the old man
came on garbed now in the ordinary garr
ments of a man ready to travel as he drew
nearer quincy shamefacedly busied himself
at dusting off the cushions i wondered if
the deed was burning a hole in his coat
pocket laughing zach set foot upon the
porch

  a pleasant journey i greeted

  he was calm now and he seemed to be en-
wrapped in a halo he regarded us then
raised an arm and pointed off toward the old
fort

  i spent the night out there-

  he dropped his arm he swailowed

  i have decided that i shall not go when
they must stay behind in their narrow beds
so i shall not be riding with you to the
railroad quincy but you are to keep the
deed

  he bowed to us and turned on his heel

  wait quincy cried hoyv about
washington aint you going to see the
capital zachary

  pooh thorm snapped his fingers de-
risively a childs dreaming who wants
to go to washington

  he threw back his head and laughed and
it was the same laugh we had heard a thou-
sand times but we knew it now for a make-
believe laugh that was trying courageously
to hide his fondest dreaming

  zachary said quincy to our surprize

whats tellin you to stay your col
science

  yes thorm answered simply

  hodges cranked his car thoughtfully then
he came up on the porch and he counted us
and himself

  fourteen he said zachary four-
teen consciences know better whats right
than one conscience

what do you mean thorm questioned
i mean fourteen of us say you have paid
long ago and ought to go on your journey
quincy faced us how about it men
our instantaneous answer was a growled
hearty yeah

  thorm thanked us with beaming eyes
he was grateful for that vote from his neigh-
bors but he stood flat and began to shake
his head 

  youve paid a hundred times quincy
urged and seeing that the captain was not
moved he spoke to us again

  men say good-by to zachary if you
want to well be going

  some of us took the hint and started it
we rushed up and began to shake hands
with laughing zach and crowd him toward
the roaring car we literally hand-shook
him into the seat beside quincy in fact
there wasnt anything left for him but to
take the word of the fourteen consciences
and go

  all right he said huskily at last all
right he was glad happily excited

  dont forget the trunk i shouted to
hodges

  hang the trunk bawled the chver
we got to hurry to catch the train in this

wind

  it had not occurred to me until then that
the wind was starting on its forty-first day
high and hard
itpatrick greene

author of no evidence the man who stayed etc

without doubt nyanga the
chief was greatly angered and
it was only by a mighty effort
that he could restrain the tor-
rent of invectives that rose to his lips
somewhat of the fierceness of his passion
showed in his scowling face his eyes were
almost hidden by the fatness of his cheeks
but from them shone a baleful light that
caused many of the warriors to think of
death his big hands opened and closed
convulsively on a small assegai the symbol
of his rank of his power of life and death

  intya if he noted these signs heeded not
the anger of the chief his upright sol-
dierly carriage showed no sign of fear no
hint of homage

  that is all my uncle he concluded at
length my story is told

  for a short space nyanga regarded him
silently his face working furiously sud-
denly he sprang to his feet with a lightness
that was surprizing considering his big
bulk his right hand trembling with rage
held aloft the toy assegai with which he
made a threatening gesture

  the captain of the bodyguard shouted a
brief order and intya was quickly sur-
rounded by warriors

  the atmosphere was charged with death
no man moved or spoke but all watched the
chiefs right hand the hand which held the
assegai-watching for the downward thrust

and the words take him away which
would be the signal for the assegais of the
warriors to be plunged in the body of intya

  slowly nyanga sank back on his seat and
let the assegai fall from his hand the cap-
tain of the bodyguard again grunted an or-
der and the warriors released intya return-
ing to their place behind the chief

  a gasp of relief came from the old men
the councilors as all awaited for word from
nyanga

  dog he panted for he was very fat and
the fierceness of his anger had brought him
to the verge of apoplexy dog i have
listened this long time to thee hoping to
find some signs of meekness some respect
for the traditions of my people but thou
hast none thou art altogether a thing with-
out shame aye i listened to thee in part
because thou art my brothers son because
thou art blood of my blood and no man-
child dwells in the shadow of my hut but
to what end have i listened to hear thee
sing the praises of the white men whom ye
foolishly seek to ape

  thou sayest that the white men have
won a great fight where then are the cat-
tle they captured do their warriors re-
joice because many captured maidens are
added to their huts

  nyanga paused for breath his bloodshot
eyes peering continually from side to side

  such is not the manner of the white men




adventure

-to take the women prisoners this was a
white mans war murmured intya

  a white mans war scoffed the chief
is it then the white mans way to take the
cattle and young men of their friends-aye
they called me a friendx-rbut to leave un-
touched the cattle of their enemies

  they paid thee for the cattle my uncle
and as for the warriors who went from this
kraal they went of their own accord and
they too were paid

  nyangas anger burst forth anew

  thou art overglib of tongue he snarled
a poor price they paid for the cattle
had they taken them as a gift i would have
been as well paid

they paid the price ye asked my uncle
they cheated me i tell thee they
paid the price i asked in truth but to
marka-may the spirits spit on his soul-
they gave double

  they paid him what he asked as they
paid thee

  aye therein i say they dealt unjustly
with me how was i to know that the
white men would pay whatever price i
asked being ignorant of this i say they
cheated me paying the smaller price is it
not so nyanga appealed to his coun-
cilors

  aye great chief they answered
without doubt they are men of double-
dealing there is no truth in them

  hear ye the words of my people con-
tinued nyanga complacently they are
all of one mind in this matter

  it is thy mind my uncle

  have a care thou nyanga picked up
the assegai and toyed with it once be-
fore this was raised on high and because
thou didst show no sign of fear it was cast
aside the next time thou wilt not so easily
escape he lapsed into a brief moody
silence

  where are my young bulls-the war-
riors who followed the spears of the white
men nyanga demanded suddenly their
women come every day asking for word of
their men-folk what can i answer them
many are in the land of the great spirits

o	chief

  nay it is not of them i ask of them
word has been brought and we have sung
their praises for they died in battle glorifying
my name but the others where are they
nay there is no need for thee to answer
they have become weaned from the cus-

toms of my people seeking in truth to be-
come white men forgetting their skins are
black and thou-uar and ingrate that
thou art-thou are one of them

  without doubt they will return anon my
uncle as for the rest i am no liar the
things i have told thee are true things
again do i call thee a mar are then
these white men gods nay i know them
to be of passions like unto ours yet thou
sayest that thou dost serve a white man who
can command the spirits that if he give
an order in this place it shall be heard a
days-nay a twenty days march away

  i know not how it is but it is a true
thing

  nyanga snorted

  they have bewitched thee heed well
just this one chance i give thee forgetting
the shame that i the chief should plead
with such a one as thou art wilt thou
forsake the service of the white men and re-
turn to thy kraal

  it can not be o chief i have sworn an
oath of allegiance twelve moons must 
yet serve

  then go thy way and trouble me not
further and thy name shall become a thing
of shame among the people

  and what of nada thy daughter

  she is not for thee save-see how merci-
ful i am-thou canst pay the lobelia the
marriage gift i ask

  that i will do gladly had ye asked all
that is mine i would gladly pay it

  and what is thine nyanga asked
mildly

  i am headman of the kraal that was my
fathers

  nay not so thou wert headman it
is true but not so now

  juffa

  the captain of the bodyguard came for-
ward

  inkosi

  thou hast ever been faithful to me
scorning the ways of the white men that
ye may learn how the chief rewards those
who are faithful do i make thee headman of
the kraal that was intyas and all that is in
it is thine unless so be intya can pay me the
lobelia i ask nyanga smiled grimly
what then do ye ask 

  restore to me my last dwelling-place-
that is all

  but what talk is this

  nay i speak not further now get ye
with the aid of the spirits	

gone before i order that ye be beaten from
the kraal

it is an order said intya wonderirigly
and walked slowly from the council-place

at the gate of the stockade that
encircled the kraal intya was
greeted by a slender graceful
maiden

o-he intya whither goest thou
to the place of the white men the sun
no longer shines for me in this place
how sayest thou nada cried in
aggrieved tones is not this the place of
my dwelling

  of a truth but thou art not for me
what meanest thou what said my
father the chief

  he will have none of me nor will he con-
sent to our wedding unless i pay him the
lobelia he demands

  what then thou art rich but per-
chance i have lost favor in thy sight

  he caught her fiercely to him

  thou knowest that is not so all my
wealth is as a thing of no moment compared
to thee

  then why

  he released her suddenly and his arms
dropped to his side dejectedly

  but i had forgotten i have no wealth
less than the dogs am i no longer am i
headman the chief thy father hath put
another in my place

  ah wo is us but why hath he done
thus

  who shall say because i am in the ser-
vice of the white men perchance tell me
nada why is he so embittered against
them

  did he not say

  some little he spoke of the cattle he had
sold to the white men receiving he said less
than did marka the chief of the land to the
south that angered him

  and that is all

  save that he scorned me and others from
this kraal who have entered the service of
the white men yet there was a time when
he held himself greatly honored that i flesh
of his flesh had found favor in the eyes of
the white men

  intya proudly fingered the sergeants
stripes which adorned his sleeve and the
medal on his chest

  then thou hast not heard of the great
shame

  

   nay what is the story

   look yonder and learn

   intya looked over the broad expanse of
veld that fronted the kraal it was level
as the palm of a mans hand thus by cut-
ting down the trees and destroying the
tangled forest growth had nyanga and by-
gone chiefs insured themselves from surprize
attacks intya turned to nada-

   i can not read thy riddle nada
canst see the ant-hills that were wont to
stand at the edge of the bush-land yonder
she pointed across the clearing to where
the jungle-growth began

   intya looked rubbed his eyes and looked
again

   nay he said at length they are not
there who hath defiled the burial-place of
the chiefs

   white men came to my fathers kraal o
intya white men with guns drawn by
many mules the voice of the guns was as
the mighty thunder and when they spoke
the ant-hills the burial-place of the chiefs
and the one that was to have been my fath-
ers place when he leaves us to go to the
spirits vanished in a cloud of dust

  now know i what meant the chief by
the words return to me my resting-place
and all shall be well that is the lobelia i
must pay for thee nada but what hope
of that alas we are indeed undone

   she clung tightly to him

   at least i will marry none other she
said hope still o mighty one per-
chance thou will yet find a way hast thou
not the ears of the white men

   it is well thought of maiden a new
hope filled intyas voice they destroyed
and they must repay now fare thee well
for i must go the camp of the white men
is seven days trek from here and already i
have dallied too long it would ill become
me sergeant intya of the bretis so afri-an
polis to be absen out leaf

   the last words were spoken in english
and nada looked at him with a wonder as if
he had uttered the wisdom of the universe

seven days later intya arrived at
zamba where a gigantic aerodrome
was in course of construction hun-
dreds of natives under the directions of
white men were busily at work clearing the
land of the stunted bushes that had been
overlooked when the bigger task was accom-
plished-the felling of mighty trees


adventure

   on the far side of the clearing was a group
of huts the headquarters of the white men
and to the left another and larger group the
quarters of the native police thitherward
intya directed his steps unheedful of the
toilers who shouted their greetings

  only once he stopped and that was to con-
verse briefly with a squad of men who were
rolling the ground in front of the aeroplane-
shed with a clumsy native-made roller they
were men of his own tribe and to them
he gave news of the kraal then running
quickly for it wanted but an hour to sunset
and he had much to do ere he reported for
duty he came to the hut which he shared
with three other sergeants entering he
doffed his uniform and busied himself with
removing the travel-stains burnishing until
they shone like gold the brass buttons and
buckles of his uniform

  the bugle sounding the call fatigue
parties-dismiss found him still at his
task but before the last notes had died away
intya presented himself at the door of the
hut before which floated a tattered flag
he saluted gravely then passed into the
hut

  sergeant intya he said returned from
leave of absence begs to report for duty sar

  captain moulter of the royal air force
nodded absently

  had scoff sergeant

  yes sar

  then stay here we may need you

  so you see moulter continued the in-
terrupted conversation with barry his lieu-
tenant theres nothing we can do but
change our plans and prepare a station at
markas kraal instead of nyangas

  barry groaned

  thatll be hell old chap the country
round there is as bad as or worse than it was
at ndola its thick with bloomin ant-hills
and- he groaned again and moulter
echoed the groan

  they had first-hand information of the
stupendous task the clearing of the ground
for an aerodrome at ndola had been a task
occupying nearly a thousand men seven
weary months seven months torture in the
reek of jungle heat totally devoid of the
comforts of civilization the work of remov-
ing myriads of ant-hills-ant-hills measuring
all of twenty-five feet high each containing
tons of earth

  and markas was evert worse barry said

  isnt there any way we can force

fatty- this was barrys name for ny-
anga-to come to terms

   not as i see it the old chap thinks that
he has been cheated somehow and wont
have anything to do with us he says that
we cant fly and if we can its because we are
in league with the devil and evil is sure to
come of it but theres some other reason
and i suspect if we could find out what he
meant by restore my last resting-place
everything in the garden ud be lovely but
not a word could i get out of him or any
one else as to what he was driving at
cant we go ahead without his consent
its an ideal place plenty of good water and
hardly any clearing to be done

  no chance of doing that where would
we get the labor in the first place besides
headquarters stated that we are not to an-
tagonize the natives and specially warned
me to keep in with nyanga-blast him
well its a good job marka hasnt any
grudge against us it ud mean clearing out
the forest if he had and id rather move ant-
hills any day i tell you what old man-
barry spoke excitedly struck by a sudden
idea-i believe the two old bounders are
playing a double game to see how much they
can get out of the government

  when we first made a survey marka
begged us to build at his kraal-offered us
free labor and the lord knows what then
as soon as he heard that nyanga wouldnt
have us he changed his tune and is charging
top price for labor and is asking a big indem-
nity for the land well use what do you
think cant we play one off against the
-other

  no use nyanga hates marka like
poison says hes a thief and a liar i
cant imagine him entering into a conspiracy
wifh marka no hes got a grievance real
or fancied if we could find out what it
was and make it square with him thered be
nothing more to it

  sar is it permitted that i speak
  the captain regarded intya closely
  well sergeant

  sar i am from nyangas kraal he is
my uncle and somewhat is known to me
that is hidden from thee

  canst tell what meant the chief by the
words restore my last resting-place
aye that i know and the reason
wherefore he hath no regard for the white

men thus it is-

  and intya told of his love for nada of
with the aid of the spirits



how the chief had made another headrqan in
his place refusing to countenance his mar-
riage until he had paid the strange lobelia

  then thou art tied by the same rope that
binds us said the captain

  aye inkosi but perchance i know of a
knife to cut the rope

  say on

  first i would ask a boon

  does sergeant intya barter with his cap-
tain there was the quality of steel in the
captains voice for all that he spoke quietly

  thy pardon inkosi but this matter is
dear to my heart

  what would ye ask

  that if all things happen according to
thy liking thou wilt give me an onorable
deescharge again that all things that ye
do shall be done in the eyes of my people
as if at my command

  it is no small thing that ye ask intya
but it shall be granted thee thou shalt be
given an honorable discharge and-save
that it touch our honor-all things shall be
as if at thy command

  that is good inkosi then know ye not
that when a chief of my tribe dies he is
buried in an ant-hill that he may the sooner
go to the land of the great spirits

  that i know what of it

  at the edge of the clearing which sur-
rounds my uncles kraal stood many ant-
hills in them all save one were the bones
of bygone chiefs that other one was to
have been the last restingplace of nyanga
when it came his time to die to the kraal
many moons ago came white soldiers men
of the artillry with the big guns the
guns opened their mouths and roared and lo
the ant-hills vanished in a cloud of dust
barry cursed fluently

  the- fools some half-baked sub-
altern trying to show off i suppose he said
to the captain i dont blame fatty for
being mad after seeing the family vault
blown sky-high

  but what then asked moulter

  thou must return the ant-hill that was
to have been my uncles that is all intya
replied simply

  how

  intya looked at the white man in aston-
ishment

  does the inkosi ask me how has he
not the machine which flies through the air
can he not then gather the pieces that were
scattered by the shell and rebuild the hill

 and if the hill be not until all is ready-
 what then the spirits move mysteriously
 and no man shall say how these things mav
 be

   ye speak in riddles intya

  somewhat hark ye inkosi it al-
ways seemed to me that my uncles resting-
place would have nought of comfort for
him his hill look you was but a small one
barely the height of a man and in thickness
less than that have ye not noticed that
there are many ant-hills hereabeuts of that
size and the road to nyangas kraal is of
easy passage for the machine that has many
feet intya meant the tractors that were
used in the work of clearing

   a gleam of understanding showed in the
 captains eyes as he turned to barry with
 do you get it

	pon my soul i believe i do but can
it be done wed have to move a hill bod-
ily no chance knocking one down and
then trying to build it up again fatty
couldnt be fooled that way

   i think we can do it

   but its got to be done properly with
 trimmings and all that

   well leave that to intya what is thy
 counsel further sergeant

seven days later a number of
native police all owing allegiance
to nyanga arrived at the kraal of
the chief affirming that they at the request
of intya had been granted permission to
visit their wives each bore a present to
the chief and spoke loudly in praise of intya
and the greatness of his wisdom

   hard on their arrival came many natives
 of another district and made their camp at
 the edge of the clearing which surrounded
 the kraal and near to where the ant-hills-
 the burial-places of the chiefs-had been

   these men were under the charge of intya
 and at his direction they erected a large can-
 vas tent this the people of the kraal
 noted was closely guarded at all times

   the returned soldiers noised it abroad
 that it was part of the white mens magic
 that they at the request of intya would at-
 tempt to restore the last resting-place of the
 chief when questioned how such things
 could be they lapsed into silence thus
 further arousing the curiosity of the people

   only nyanga the chief professed indif-
 ference though it was noted that he often-
 times chanced to walk that way


adventure

  anon in the darkness of the night came
two tractors coupled together and hauling a
low platform mounted on wheels the plat-
form was heavily laden but none stopped to
investigate for of a surety this ponderous
clanking monster had its being in the place
of the wicked ones its single eye was
blinding and winked not so much for the
search-light mounted on the first tractor

  soon the tent hid the platform from the
eyes of any curious ones who might have
conquered their fear of the clanking monster
and then arose wild songs and the furious
beating of tom-toms drowning completely
the shouted orders of white men the rattling
of chains and the blows of hammers

  with the rising of the morning sun the
people of the kraal went out to view what
new wonders had been performed and lo
the swarm of laborers had vanished the
tent too had gone but in its place stood a
high pile of brushwood and by it-hands up-
lifted as if invoking the great spirits-stood
intya

  what means this some asked of the
soldiers

  intya prays the great ones to aid the
white men restore the resting-place of the
chief

  a low droning filled the air and all faces
were turned upward an aeroplane swiftly
came into their field of vision

  what is that they cried in terror

  the white man goes to the home of the
spirits seeking the place of the chief
certain of the old men councilors hast-
ened to bear the news to nyanga

ye are bewitched fools he cried in tones
of contempt my resting-place hath been
scattered to the four winds can intya by
words restore it and for this other-this
story of men flying-bah it is childs talk
yet come and see for thyself great chief
aye i will come but to see i will not
coming to the open ground about the
kraal they pointed in the direction of the
aeroplane now fast going out of sight

  see ye they said excitedly yonder
against the rising sun it is like unto a giant
bird hear ye not the droning as if of
man bees

  without doubt it is a bird ye see the
bees ye hear answered the chief but
who is this nyanga pointed to intya
who was running swiftly toward them
ay e i see now it is that thing of folly-
that nephew of mine

  is it permitted that i speak o chief
intya cried

  aye say on

  word hath come to me o chief from
the spirits that thy request shall be granted
this night after the setting of the sun when
darkness covers the land will i light the fire
yonder- he pointed to the pile of brush-
wood-that the spirits may see to perform
their tasks and restore thy resting-place to
thee

   art so sure then that the spirits will heed
thy petition

  without doubt o chief but first i
would know thy intentions concerning two
things

  speak

  thou wilt restore to me the headship of
the kraal and give the maiden nada to me
such was thy promise to me and thy
promise to the white men thou wilt also
abide by that

  my word given have i ever denied it
  nay great one

  then see that thou canst accomplish all
that thou hast boasted if ye fail thy friend-
ship with the white men shall not save thee
i shall not fail but thou wilt be here
thou and all the people this night to witness
the wonders

  aye

  then until that time let it be thy pleas-
ure that none shall come near to the place
yonder it is sacred to the spirits

  at the command of the chief the people
fled with one accord to their huts there to
wait the time appointed for the wonder-
working to begin

  only the maiden nada stayed for a brief
moment to speak with intya

  canst thou indeed do this thing o bull
of might an ye doubt let us flee together
from this place and seek safety from the
wrath of my father among the white men
fear not nada i shall not fail all
shall be as i have said

  somewhat am i afraid of thee o power-
ful one thou dost talk with the spirits
yet seek my love thou canst perform
wonder-workings yet ask for-this

  she kissed him then sped quickly away

the sun had set and the land was
covered with darkness - tropical
darkness

  out on the edge of the clearing came the
people of the kraal cattle disturbed by the
with the aid of the spirits



strange exodus lowed mournfully the half-
starved dogs of the village set up a noisy
clamor yelping with pain as they were
driven off by well-aimed stones

  anon all was still save for the whimpering
of a frightened child and the people of the
kraal waited in silence for the wonders to be-
gin to them came the voice of intya-
are ye all here o people of nyanga
aye none are left in the huts an-
swered the voice of the chief

  then move not from the places ye now
hold wait in patience and pray that the
great spirits deal kindly with us

  there was a sharp hiss and a shower of
sparks then a bright light shot up into the
air

  up and up it went until it seemed as if it
would of surety enter the land of the
spirits

  it is intyas messenger murmured one
as they watched it broke into other lights
many-colored and then to their ears came
the sound of a sharp report

  the spirits are angry

  nay watch-listen comforted intya
a low droning filled the air louder and
louder it came anon it seemed to be di-
rectly overhead and then ghostly red flames
appeared to be dancing in the darkness
flames which twisted and twirled into many
fantastic figures

  have mercy on us o intya cried
nyanga the evil spirits are about us
nay they are the spirits of the great
great watch

  the command was needless for the people
could not take their eyes away from the
strange things that were happening in the
darkness	

   tis as if some mighty bird were all afire
and seeks to escape his death-agony said
one

  gradually the flames died away and all
was still save for the droning noise which
became ever fainter

  then from a great height or so it seemed
in the darkness came a blinding ray of light
straight down it came as a stone dropped
from the hand

  and then intya applied a torch to the pile
of brush quickly it caught a-light and as
it burned the voicfe of intya was heard or-
dering them to come nearer with fear in
their hearts the people obeyed him

  watch the fire of sacrifice cried intya
the spirits have heard our plea and have

granted the desire of the chief watch the
fire of sacrifice

  as the light of the fire died down the light
from above was played directly on it

  then seen dimly at first through the
thick haze of smoke the people could discern
the shadowy outlines of an ant-hill clearer
and more distinct it became as the smoke
died away and the people saw that this was
no shadowy figment of the imagination but
that it was indeed an ant-hill-the resting-
place of the chief as this became plainly
evident to them they all fell to their knees
hiding their faces in their hands crying
loudly

  merciful are the spirits great is intya
their mouthpiece and the white men their
messengers

of the chain of aerodromes
which make the cape to cairo air-
flight possible the one of nyanga
is generally acknowledged to be the best
no others can compete with its vast level
landing-field no others have such well-
built comfortable quarters for the pilots
the whole-hearted manner in which the la-
borers perform their task of caring for the
place is the admiration of the officers in
charge of other aerodromes whose daily por-
tion it is to deal with laziness and thievery
with desertion and mutiny

  perhaps the reason for all this is that
intya the chief-nyanga having abdi-
cated in his nephews favor-was once a ser-
geant of the native police perhaps because
the people had seen at first hand the wonder-
working of the white men having a lively
remembrance of the fact that the white men
could command the spirits to come to their
aid

  and of a surety no other station boasts a
chief one of royal blood as a lookout

  proud is nyanga of his position-happily
ignorant of the fact that it was specially
created for him-as at the first signs of an
approaching aeroplane he tolls a large bell
warning all to clear the field

  he firmly believes that a landing could
not be safely made unless he tolled his bell
and-for they are a superstitious crowd-
the pilots have adopted him as their mascot
nor will one ascend until nyanga has tolled
the bell commending them to the care of the
great spirits

  near to the bell stands a solitary ant-hill
it is destined to be the last resting-place of


adventure

nyanga tl was his wish that the bell should
be hung t ear the ant-hill for he said

  when my time comes to go to the land of
the spirits this siall be my resting-place
at the bottom of the hill ye shall leave a

hole so that my snake that soul of mine
may be free to come and go as it pleases
thus may i come out and toll the bell when
those worthy ones those men of keen eyes
go forth to greet the spirits of the air

author of blackmail llvild blood etc

rant douglas left the girl in
the midst of other admirers and
came into his fathers darkened
library to think about her

 he had known frances wvck for about a
month behind her almost flirtatious man-
ner he had seen that she was warily alert
and her blue eyes at times had anabrupt
chilliness that was not explainable by any-
thing he knew of other women

 grant felt that it wras very bad to have
his father and brother think him a thief
but to have the woman that he suddenly
loved think so too-and not care that
was what really bewildered him and he sat
in the dark and brooded

 no doubt it was his brother who had told
her but no doubt brother john-it was
in irony that grant called him brother
john-would have been as surprized as
shocked had he known how miss wvck felt
about it

 most people approved of john though he
was preternaturally suave as perhaps a
rising young lawyer should be and so grant
felt was always making people around
him painfully aware of his attentiveness to
business tall noiseless soft-spoken dark-
eyed pleasant with a quick brain and an
exasperatingly modest air john had be-

come the pride of his fathers eye and very
nearly the most distinguished member of
douglas douglas  douglas attorneys-at-
law

  john loved the law and grant hated it
john was up to all the curlicues wrinkles
and tricks that a legal gamester can play-
that was business but grant had never won
a case in which he did not believe that his
client was right-that was quixotic

  john could win anything he might get
even miss wyck

  that night he was staying late in the
city-to attend to business he said
always business came first

  the house was packed with week-enders
his father enjoyed company by the herds
and john in a sly calculating way thought
it was a good thing to entertain-good for
business

  that evening a group of people had
chatted for a moment or two about a
police raid on-an exclusive gambling-place

  you have flirted with chance miss
wyck had asked

  i am a lawyer said grant who also
owed some pressing debts at cards

  risky things are most delightful she
added slowly arent they

  under her blonde fluffiness there was an
trapped



almost mysterious reserve a sort of watch-
ful purpose a steely glinj that puzzled
him other people had not seemed to
notice it in fact she did not seem to show
much of that manner when talking with
other people

  i love to gamble she dropped her
voice i can understand-i really can-
why people do crime the excitement-
it is the same as gambling

  nothing so romantic he said i
never knew anybody to gamble to lose
a man takes any chance to win

  even turn burglar the question
slipped smoothly from her lips but with
such a significant glance and intonation
that grant flushed

  the office safe to which only members of
the firm had access just about a month
before had been opened some money taken
and the safe carefully relocked almost
unfortunately grant whose weakness was
gambling had made a winning that same
evening and paid some of the debts of
which his father was angrily aware no
denial of his could make either his father or
brother believe that he had not borrowed
the money

  his father was an impulsive high-tem-
pered generous man who had been in a
rage for several days over the matter then
had seemed to forget it

  grant knew by the manner of miss wyck
that she had heard the story and he was
astounded when she reached over and
patted his hand quickly saying

  there are worse things ive broken
into locks myself

  she seemed inviting intimacy almost
asking for confidences it bewildered him

  he really did not know much about
frances wyck his father knew her-
a daughter of an old friend he had
said and grants sister liked her frances
was a pretty young woman with something
fascinatingly dangerous about her and in
spite of her nearly flirtatious gaiety he
felt that she was far-sighted and he knew
that she was watchful but he loved her-
and had told her so in answer he got
laughter that gave no decision but did not
discourage him

the library door opened and shut
quietly

  that you dad grant called
  no answer he waited a moment-

 waited for the light to be turned on but
 there was only silence

 who is it

 silence

come on whats the joke

 no reply

grant arose reached to the table and
jerked the cord of the reading-lamp at the
same time looking over his shoulder and
into the muzzle of an ivory-handled revolver
behind which crouched a man in evening
dress his hair had been hastily rumpled and
a white handkerchief was tied around his
face clear to the eyes

i say- grant began

shut up the voice was low hoarse
disguised

 the light was indistinct outside of the
 brilliant glow immediately under the lamp
 most men look alike in dress suits the
 house was full of men in them so it was not
 easy even to guess who the figure might be

 at a gesture grant lifted his hands

the man obviously had not expected to
find any one there but hurriedly made
what disguise he could by pulling his hair
down over his eyes tying the handkerchief
about his face and crouching as he did so
that it was impossible to judge his height
a hoarse whisper will hide almost anybodys
natural voice

 open that safe said the man

 cant

open that-

combinations been changed said
grant

lie the hoarse voice appeared a
little shocked

 only yesterday grant insisted com-
 bination changed

it had not been but he was taking a
chance that the burglar would not know
better

the burglar did he said-

 go over there

 grant went

the masked man followed him warily
when grant had kneeled before the safe
door a flash-light streamed across his shoul-
der on to the circular metal about the
knob

 open it

 i tell you i cant grant protested

 the man began calling off the combina-
 tion forcing grant to follow it the rob-
 ber had come expecting to open the safe
 quietly but finding grant there perhaps

m


adventure

 thought it easier to make him help than to
 tie and gag him

  grant had no great wonder as tohow the
fellow knew the combination the safe
was really more of a fire-proof box than any-
thing else and at least three or four of the
douglas clerks had been given the combi-
nation when sent to the house after forgot-
ten papers

  when the door swung open the fellow
said-

  hand me that yellow envelop

  it was the first thing in sight-and con-
tained money grant knew there were ten
thousand-dollar bills in it

  he felt the muzzle of the gun against his
spine as he held the envelop over his shoul-
der it was roughly jerked away

  stay where you are on your knees if
you look toward me ill kill you

  as the man said that the flashlight went
out

  grant knew without looking around that
the fellow was slowly backing across the
room-not toward the door through which
he had come but toward the door of a
little stairway that led to his fathers den
the fellow seemed to have made himself
familiar with the house

  grant began slowly to turn his head but
the vague light of the reading-lamp revealed
the movement

  keep your head still said the voice

  a moment later there was a resounding
smash then the door shut there was a
clatter of feet on the stairs the man was
gone

  grant felt that he must have backed into
the short pedestal of the tall vase for it
overturned with a terrific crash

he leaped up and ran to the
door through which the fellow had
gone it was locked

  he turned already people were beating
on the other door that opened from the hall
into the library the fellow had locked
that as he came in the fall of the vase
had been heard

  grant opened the door-

  quick-a robber-he went that way
grant cried and pointed

  there was a start for thedoor but he
said that it was locked some stopped but
others went and tried the door

  among those who stood near grant lis-
tening closely to him were frances wyck

and his father there was the usual bab-
ble and flurry of excitement some women
felt it was a good chance to get special
attention by being hysterical men talked
excitedly and a few hurried out as if in
search of the robber but more likely to be
the first to carry the news

  as grant was rapidly telling what hap-
pened he looked into miss wycks face
she was watching him closely with some-
thing more than the interest of the curious
excited women about him in fact she
did not appear excited at all but her tense-
ness was inescapable and her eyes scrutiniz-
ing

  in turning from her he looked toward his
father and was very nearly unable to
go on

  judge douglas as he was called out of
deference to past honors and continued
success was a robust man of the southern
type his face was inclined to be red but
at that moment it was nearly pale his
features were prominent and strong and
the graying long hair was brushed back
over his head

  to those around him judge douglas pre-
sented the air of one more sorry to have
guests disturbed than to lose whatever rob-
bers might take

  there was chattering speculation about
the robber and all were soon of the opinion
that the fellow had been frightened into
haste by the noise he made in overturning
the vase and they were convinced that
the robber was one of themselves-a guest
in the house

  the people began to withdraw still in
agitated wonder but as grant started out
his father called to him for a private word
judge douglas turned and talked to miss
wyck until every one else had left the
library then he accompanied her to the
door closed it and turned toward grant

  you-you- he began very angry
you scoundrel

  i dont understand

  you lie sir judse douglas cried

  i lie

  and steal

  father what do vou dare mean by
that

  that you opened this safe and imagined
a masked bandit when you tumbled against
the vase you didnt know the door to my
den was locked-till you tried to leave
you had this one locked to keep people out
trapped



you were trapped and lied-but not even
cleverly

  father

  never use that word to me again sir
never again the father of a thief-no
you gambler cheat thief

  i do gamble i do not cheat i am no
thief 

  you robbed the office safe too i
couldnt believe it of you but here-
here-it is proved i trapped you

  you trapped me you-stoop to that
contemptible grant was angry

  contemptible eh contemptible-to
get caught your brother begged me not
to do it john has defended you-blamed
our clerks-anybody-everybody-to pro-
tect you all in spite of your disrespect to
and hatred for him he said that one way
to catch a thief was to set a trap-but that
you werent a thief  you are

  john suggested it said grant

  john had defended you first last and all
the time if he suggested the trap it was
because he believed in you wanted to
prove to me that you would not steal
youve got your inheritance all of it
take it and be out of this house by morn-
ing

  but fa- judge douglas i did not--
what were you doing in here-door
locked-low light- a detective has watched
you

detective who is he-what-father
i had to be sure i wanted to know
what debts you had i didnt want to
tempt you to lie by questioning you i
wanted to know

  john too-the detective he suggested
it

  john has been your best friend why
did you sneak away and come in here
alone

 i came-

  yes you came why

  to think said grant

  to think-about your debts and this
safe the temptation was too strong you
thought you could invent the story of the
masked robber you are no longer my
son i rewrite my will-tonight-now
get out

  father

  i am no father of yours you thief
as grant went toward the door it opened
and john came hurrying in closing the door
softly behind him

john was rather slender and a
little stooped with dark watchful
eyes and the fixed smile of one who
wishes to appear agreeable to all people
he had an almost kindly expression though
grant knew him for as cold-blooded a law-
yer as ever bamboozled a jury his voice
was trained smooth the words carefully
chosen and pronounced

  he was about as excitable as a piece of
iron but as he came hurrying into the
library carrying his hat and wearing his
topcoat john showed a great deal of agita-
tion

  grant-grant tell me-it isnt so
it was a robber-wasnt it i just this

minute got here and heard it was-

  he gripped grants arm looking at him
earnestly

  judge douglas pushed him aside with
no john not this time-you cant
defend him there is no doubt and not the
trace of a robber imagine a burglar tell-
ing grant the combination to the safe it
is not even a clever story

  grant john exclaimed i dont be-
lieve it father he couldnt-he simply
couldnt and yet-oh grant

  grant felt like a brute for not feeling
that john was sincere but it was expecting
the unnatural for a man of johns money-
loving nature not to be pleasantly aware
that his inheritance was being doubled
though the family honor was being smirched

  grant turned to the door and as he went
out he heard his father saying that right
then and there a new will must be made

  but you will surely destroy it tomor-
row john replied he knew the impul-
siveness of his father perhaps even better
than grant

  never my boy never gambler-
liar-thief stranger

  it was nearing eleven oclock as grant
went out and he turned up the stairs hur-
riedly anxious to avoid every one and be
by himself but at the top of the stairs he
met frances wyck

  he spoke and started by but she caught
his arm saying-

  i have waited for you grant

  you too want the truth he said bit-
terly well then i am a thief i turned
the vase over by accident and imagined the
masked man

  you imagine badly if you think i be-
lieve that she replied with arresting


adventure

 calmness the more surprizing because of her
 ruffles and fluffiness

 what you dont think--

 hope came to him suddenly

 no i do not think

 her gesture was mothering he never
 would be able to understancj her it was
 the last sort of gesture and tone that he
 would have expected from her more sur-
 prizingly she said-

 and i would not have blamed you if
 you were guilty

 frances

 oh i can say that knowing you are not
 guilty

 grant impulsively took her hand she
 drew it away

 but- he began protestingly

 she read his thought and answered-

 i do not draw back from you and i
 believe you innocent

 you know i love you

 she replied-

 i know that you are grateful

 you know frances this is not the first
 time i have been thought a thief

 she nodded

 john told you grant went on yes
 john would tell you

 shh-sh- you will be angry if you keep
 on talking john said that he deeply
 regretted that your father suspected you
 he told me himself that he was sure you
 would neyer do such a thing

 but in telling you that he could tell you
 that i was suspected grant cried oh
 he is a born lawyer

 shh-hh she repeated just now you
 should avoid hasty judgment-it has made
 you a thief

 i know i know he replied humbly
 it must be some man in the house there
 are a dozen who-a detective too

 a detective

 yes i wish that he had kept better
 watch on me

 both were silent for a time then he
 extended his hand

 i am going before sunrise-my father
 said i could have the money that was
 stolen that is to be my inheritance
 good-by

 no-no not before sunrise please
 grant promise me dont be stubborn
 dont rush off like that

 i was told to go

 i am telling you not to go please

  and have people come up to me saying
how sorry they are yet with the joy of
scandal on their faces no thank you
ill clear out a thief has no right to love

a respectable woman so miss wyck i-

  you dont know that i am respectable
she said quickly smiling speaking so easily
that he was astonished

  but- he was showing astonishment

  you are ready to doubt she flashed
and laughed softly not merrily

  no i love you he protested

  and you are so sure that you wouldnt
love a woman who wasnt respectable no
grant it isnt love with you it is grati-
tude-and curiosity and if you wont
leave the house at sunrise ill make a con-
fession

  confession

  confession

  what-tell me-i dont understand
he protested

  no and you wouldnt if i told you-
now good-by grant

   he tried to question her to talk but she
was evasive and cryptic and at last he
strode off bitter

frances watched him go she
was thoughtful and the steely qual-
ity that had glittered under her
fluff and laces appeared in her pretty face

   if i could get in his room she said to
herself i am sure that i could find that
money i simply must get it away from
him without his knowing

   she stood for a long time in the upstairs
hall while the music for dancing and voices
of people floated up at last resolutely she
went looking for a servant and having
found one followed him back up the stairs
turning into her room as he went on to
grants door

   who is it grant called replying to the
knock

   your father sir wishes to speak to you
he would like for you to wait in his den sir
no answer the servant went away and
presently grant came out he had no
sooner disappeared down the hall than
frances darted from concealment and ran
into his room

   she began hastily deftly with the man-
ner of one accustomed to going through
other people belongings without disturb-
ing anything to search the drawers of his
room
trapped



  footsteps were outside of the door
grant had returned sooner than she ex-
pected she had thought that he might
wait indefinitely but judge douglas and
john had been in the den and grant learned
at once that no one wished to see him

  frances caught without means of get-
ting out unseen looked quickly around her
and darted behind the open door of a closet

  grant was angry and hopeless he
thought of hunting out the servant and
demanding who had given that false mes-
sage but instead he sat down on a chair to
think and brooded

  it was very cramped and close quarters
behind the closet door but as she had
no one to blame but herself frances en-
dured it with good grace and kept her eyes
fastened on his face when he finally
arose took out a revolver and examined
it meditatively she was startled into a
movement that made a slight sound

  grant wheeled and stood listening but
at that moment some people passed with
much talk through the hall and he either
forgot the noise that had attracted his
attention or thought it had been made by
those in the hall he threw the gun
dejectedly back into the drawer and
slumped miserably into a chair-and there
he sat on and on

  frances began to be alarmed then weary
her body ached from standing tense in a
position that permitted little change and no
rest he would sit as if frozen for a half-
hour then stir slightly and again become
immobile

  there was no way for her to escape unless
he left the room or went to sleep and luck
was not with her he did neither she
blamed herself for having been careless
enough to get caught in a situation of the
kind but self-blame could not help grant
did not leave his chair she leaned against
the wall to get what- rest she could and
smiled painfully

  hours went by she was nearly ex-
hausted but her fluffiness was only on
the surface she did not faint or sink to the
floor

  the house had become quiet after the
bustle and tramp the laughter and calling
of partings in the hall and at the doors

  then out of the silence hurried slippered
feet went pattering through the hall there
was a sharp knock on a door not far away-
an excited voice rose indistinctly-other

excited voices joined it and there was in-
creasing excitement and babbling with
people scurrying about

  grant went to the door listening some
one knocked he opened it quickly

  your father-he has been murdered

  grant turned weakly and tried to ask
questions

  he was heard moaning-beaten on the
head and stabbed

  grant half reeling went into the hall
and started for his fathers room

  frances waited it was not going to be
easy to get out of that room unseen with
the hall full of people running to and fro
though judge douglass room was at the
other end of the house

  when it seemed quiet for a moment she
slipped from behind the door but at once
moved back some one was coming noise-
lessly

  she could not see the face but a figure in
a bathrobe came into the room swiftly
opened the top dressing-table drawer
threw something into it and hurriedly
shuffled out without looking around

  frances thought that she knew who it
was and darting across the room opened
the drawer and looked at what had been
left

  i guess right she said to herself and a
moment later she darted furtively into the
hall and to her own room where quickly
as possible she gave herself the appearance
of hasty dressing and hurried to join the
group in and about the room of judge
douglas

  he lay on a broad bed of the old-fashioned
southern kind with a high carved head-
board and dark red splotches were over
the pillows and stained the soft fresh linen
the assault had been more thn murderous
it had been particularly brutal the scalp
was torn from the blow of some blunt in-
strument evidently intended to make the
sleeping man unconscious and that there
might be no possibility of recovery he had
been stabbed he moaned unconscious
and seemed to be dying

  john was on his knees beside the bed
praying aloud behind him grant stood
gazing down sorrowfully other people
disheveled and awed stood about dumbly
staring

  judge grant was greatly admired as men
are likely to be when they overcome the
fault of temper by frank apology and great


adventure

generosity his daughter had fainted and
was being supported by friends who scarcely
knew what to do

  after the first glance about the room
particularly at the two sons frances asked
if the doctor had been called he had
the police they too

  the doctor arrived first and at once
cleared the room of all who were not rela-
tives

i i when the two plain-clothes men
pijg arrived john was senf for he
pj took them into the library closing
the door he was ever neat in his appear-
ance and had found time to slip into his
clothes

  frances ran upstairs entered judge
douglass den and softly descending the
stairs from there listened at the door

  john was saying

  you understand gentlemen how re-
luctant i am to accuse or even suspect any
one of this monstrous crime and i shall
accuse no one i shall state the facts and
you may judge of the evidence

  he then related the story of the masked
robber which had not been believed by his
father

  my father and my brother quarreled
their voices were loud many heard them
i had been detained in the city by business
and as soon as i arrived home i heard of
the supposed robber and came into the
library where my father was just announc-
ing his intention of making a new will at
once and had ordered my brother to leave
the house by morning

  the detectives were beginning to see light

  i endeavored john went on earnestly
to dissuade my father from his intention
gentlemen i love my brother though we
have never been friends that is close
friends but my father was determined
the will was made out and placed in this
safe you see gentlemen the safe is open
the will is not there my father has been
murdered

  the detectives looked at each other un-
derstandingly the motive was clear

  but gentlemen john declared pas-
sionately i can not even now believe my
brother guilty-that he would do sucha
thing i can only suggest that you search
the room of the only person who would
have any interest in taking the will to
destroy it and in murdering my father so

that he could not makeanew one oh
it is terrible and it was foolish-foolish as
well as horrible tomorrow within a week
a month at most my father would have
forgiven him

so gentlemen i suggest that you
search the room and if you there find any-
thing to warrant the action you must im-
mediately bring him here i shall wait for
you to return

the detectives went out with long satis-
fied strides

frances remained at the door which she
had barely opened it had a catch lock
john sat in a deep chair with his back
toward her

the detectives bringing grant with
them soon re-entered and placed two large
envelopes on the table

oh grant grant john cried rising
and reaching toward him at the sight of the
objects the officers laid down how could
you

grant looked about helplessly bewil-
dered he could scarcely speak-

you believe that of me

but grant-this money-this will-in
your room

grant shook his head he could not
explain he could not speak he knew
that he was innocent but he was too bewil-
dered to protest

grant you know you know very well
that no matter what the terms of the will
were i would have shared equally with
you you knew that-and yet you mur-
dered our father

grant cried out he was aghast he
had not expected that

officers arrest him john said

the detectives laid hands on him then
all turned at the sound of light footsteps
and a clear pleasant voice

ya please please just a mo-

sml ment

ah miss wyck said john

turning toward her then to the officers

the private detective gentlemen whom

my father employed to watch grant

grant looked at her with weary tired

eyes he felt betrayed lost shattered

then he heard her say-

but grant is innocent

alas no miss wyck john began

you are not familiar with the evidence

that robber was imagined-
trapped



not by me she said quickly i
heard him

heard him johns voice was in-
credulous

yes i was eavesdropping i would
have come into the library but the door was
locked i am sure too that the robber
turned over the vase intentionally

 intentionally john cried and the two
 detectives echoed him grant was like a
 man returning to life

 yes it would have been such a stupid
 thing to do by accident but such a brilliant
 thing if intentionally it brought people
 running-and grants father found him in
 a compromising position the robber was
 clever it kept judge douglas from sus-
 pecting-say any of the guests

but miss wyck-the stolen will-my

 father-where else is the motive except-

 he indicated grant

thats true perhaps said frances
but grant did not leave his room i was
there with him

you-in grants room john was
shocked miss wyck though you are a
detective-it-you are a woman

 yes for that reason i did not let him
 know i was there

he didnt know-really miss wyck-

 yes really mr douglas i was behind
 a closet door i had to stay there i am
 a woman you know

why were you there john demanded
almost unpleasantly

i thought the robber would try to
clinch the suspicions against grant by put-
ting the money in his room

and-miss wyck and then john
asked quickly

some one knocked and told grant his
father had been killed

had been killed yes then-then
you got out without being seen john
cisked

 yes mr douglas

how fortunate miss wyck had peo-
ple seen-

yes mr douglas-for had the man
seen who immediately entered grants

room-

what-somebody-you saw

 i saw but not his face

 oh said john

 i saw what he did he put those things
 in the top dresser drawer

then miss wyck then

  he went out quickly

  and you did not see-

  i did not see his face no but i saw
the money and document

  the detectives made surprized sounds
and stared at each other john put his
hands to his head as if to collect whirl-
ing thoughts and grant almost collapsed
but caught himself at the edge of the table
miss wyck was undisturbed her blonde
fluffy hair gave her an almost frivolous
appearance if one did not notice her eyes
so coldly blue just then

  who-who- said john with trem-
bling voice and indignation could have
done that-and-why

  i thought she replied it possible that
this mysterious person had been plotting
with grant to steal the money and then the
will

  a hopeless groan came from grant

  the detectives looked wisely at each
other this woman was saving them the
trouble of thinking

  john turned on his brother furiously-
  so that-that-is what you did

there seemed no reason in the
world said frances why any-
body but grant would be interested
in destroying his fathers will

  none said john his eyes accusingly
on grant

  none said one detective

  yes none said the other

  but frances continued there must
be some other reason some place the
man who brought those things to grant
was not his friend

  you did not see him john cried

you said-

  no-t saw only his dressing gown i
am a woman-a woman never forgets
details of a garment colors are indicative
of character this one was covertd with
black dots i saw it again in judge
douglas room-and there i saw the mans
face too though he was kneeling

  who who for gods sake who
grant cried

  the two detectives leaned forward breath-
lessly

  john was standing tense watchful

  it was worn by the only person in the
world who would have an object in seeing
judge douglas dead so that he might imme-
diately enter upon his large inheritance


adventure

while some one else was suspected of mur-
der

you lie john screamed at her this
is a plot-dastardly you lie-i tell you
i do such a thing

frances was unruffled she faced him
steadily

why not you slipped into the library
and unexpectedly found grant here and
made him open the safe-then overturned
the vase you wanted to make his father
think him a thief- oh yes i saw you
i know you were supposed to be in the
city

officers john cried they have plotted
to ruin me arrest him-arrest her too

you are clever mr douglas but-

you can prove nothing john cried

you were in his room you are-

grant jumped forward with upraised fist

before john could move or the officers raise
a hand frances had caught his wrist

  be quiet grant dont you see that
he is confessing in every word that he

says

  then the door opened and the doctor
came in slowly he was a big man with a
deep voice and a slow emphatic manner
he looked from one to the other and ad-
dressing john said

  judge douglas is in a very serious con-
dition he may not die but i fear for
him as he is using up what little strength
he has to make a statement he recognized

his assailant and-

  the doctor did not finish he sprang
forward but not soon enough to prevent the
report of a revolver and john fell dead
in his hand was a pearl-handled revolver
and with that he had made a full confession

chapter i

tiie horse-thief

it was a warm summer morning in the
town of farewell save for a dozen
horses tied to the hitching-rail in front
of various saloons and the blue pigeon
store and bill lainey the fat landlord of
the hotel who sat snoring in a reenforced
telegraph chair on the sidewalk in the
shade of his wooden awning main street
was a howling wilderness

  dust overlay everything it had not
rained in weeks in the blacksmith shop
diagonally across the street from the hotel
piney jackson was shoeing a mule the
mule was invisible but one knew it was a
mule because piney jackson had just come
out and taken a two-by-four from the wood-
pile behind the shop and it was a well-
known fact that piney never used a two-by-
four on any animal other than a mule
but this by the way

 in the barroom of the happy heart
saloon there were only two customers and
the bartender one of the former a
brown-haired sunburnt young man with
ingenuous blue eyes was singing

   jog on jog on the footpath way

an merrily jump the stile o

yore cheerful heart goes all the day

yore sad tires in a mile o

  mr racey dawson having successfully
sung the first verse rested both elbows on

the bar and grinned at the bartender
that worthy grinned back and knowing
mr dawson slid the bottle along the bar

  have one yoreself bill mr dawson
nodded to the bartender whu-wheres
swing oh yeah

  mr dawson head up chest out stepping
high and walking very stiffly as befitted a
gentleman somewhat overserved with li-
quor crossed the barroom to where bristle-
haired swing tunstall sat on a chair and
slumbered his head on his arms and his
arms on a table

  mr dawson stooped and blew into mr
tunstalls right ear mr tunstall began to
snore gently growing irritated by this
continued indifference on the part of mr
tunstall mr dawson seized the chair by
rung and back and incontinently dumped
mr tunstall all abroad on the saloon floor

  mr tunstall promptly hitched himself
into a corner and drifted deeper into slum-
ber mr dawson turned a perplexed face
on the bartender

  now what yuh gonna do with a feller
like that mr dawson asked plaintively

  mr jack richie manager of thecross-in-
a-box ranch entering at the moment
temporarily diverted mr dawsons atten-
tion for mr dawson had once ridden for
the cross-in-a-box outfit hence he was
moved literally to fall upon the neck of
mr richie

  lean on yore own breakfast urged
mr richie studiously dissembling his joy


o

adventure

at sight of his old friend and carefully
steering mr dawson against the bar
here i know what you need drink
hearty racey

   son me declared mr dawson
everythins on me i gug-got money i
have an i aim to spend it free an plenty
cause theres more where im goin an

i aint gonna earn it punchin cows neither
dont do nothin rash mr richie
advised and took advantage of a friends
privilege to be insulting i helped lynch a
road-agent only last month

  which the kuh-hold-up business is too
easy for a live man opined mr dawson
we want somethin mum-more diff-diff-
difficult me an swing do so were goin
to arizona where the gold grows no more
wrastlin cows no more hard work for us
were gonna get rich quick we are what
you laughin at

  i never laugh denied mr richie
when yore stakin out claims dont forget
me

  we wont averred mr dawson sol-
emnly les have another

  they had another-several others

  the upshot was that when mr richie-
who was the lucky possessor of a head that
liquor did not easily affect-departed home-
ward at four pm he left behind him a
sadly plastered mr dawson

  mr tunstall of course was still sleeping
deeply and noisily but mr dawson had
long since lost interest in mr tunstall
it is doubtful whether he remembered that
mr tunstall existed the two had begun
their party immediately after breakfast
mr tunstall had succumbed early but
mr dawson had not once halted his efforts
to make the celebration a huge success
so it is not a subject for surprize that mr
dawson some thirty minutes after bidding
mr richie an affectionate farewell should
stagger out into the street and ride away on
the horse of some one else

  the ensuing hours of the evening and the
night were a merciful blank to mr dawson
his first conscious thought was when he
awoke at dawn on a side-hill a sharp rock
prodding him in the small of the back and
the bridle-reins of his dozing horse wound
round one arm only it was not his horse
his horse was a red roan this horse was a
bay it wasnt his saddle either

  wheres my hoss he demanded of the
world at large and sat up suddenly

  the sharp movement wrung a groan from
the depths of his being the loss of his
horse was drowned in the pains of his aching
head never was such an all-pervading
ache he knew the top was coming off
he knew it he could feel it and then did
-with his fingers he groaned again

  his tongue was dry as cotton and it hurt
him to swallow he stood up but as
promptly sat down in a whisper-for
speech was torture-he began to revile
himself for a fool

  i might a knowed it was his plaint
i had a feelin when i took that last glass it
was one too many i never did know when
to stop id like to know how i got here an
where my hoss is an who belongs to this
one

  he eyed the mount with disfavor he
had never cared for bays

  an that aint much of a saddle neither
he went on with his soliloquy cheap
saddle-looks like a boys saddle-an a old
saddle-bet noah used one just like it
try to rope with that saddle an yuhd pull

the horn to -engone wonder whats

in that saddle-pocket

  he pulled himself erect slowly and ten-
derly his knees were very shaky his
head throbbed like a squeezed boil but-
he wanted to learn what was in that
saddle-pocket possibly he might obtain
therein a clue to the horses owner

  he slipped the strap of the pocket-flap
flipped it open inserted his fingers and
drew forth a small package wrapped in
newspaper and tied with the blue string
affected by the blue pigeon store in fare-
well

  mr dawson balanced the package on two
fingers for a reflective instant then he
snapped the string and opened the package

  socks an a undershirt he said dis-
gustedly and started to say more but
paused for there was something queer about
that undershirt his head was still spin-
ning and his eyes were sandy but he per-
ceived quite plainly that there were narrow
blue ribbons running round the neck of that
undershirt he unrolled the socks and
found them much longer in the leg than the
kind habitually worn by men

  mr dawson agitatedly dived his hand
once more into the saddle-pocket and
this time he pulled out a tortoise-sjiell
shuttle round which was wrapped several
inches of lingerie edging but mr dawson
the heart of the range



  did not call it lingerie edging he called
  it tatting and swore again

    that settles it he said cheerlessly
  ive stole some womans cayuse

chapter ii

the yellow dogs

 it was a chastened racey dawson
 who returned to farewell he went
 directly to the blacksmith shop

     lo hoss-thief was piney jacksons
  cheerful greeting

  more when she seen she had to ride home

  accordeen of yores you left behind

    racey dawson was too reduced in spirit
  properly to take umbrage at this insult to
  his horse he could only repeat his request
  that piney make not of himself a bigger
  fool than usual and when piney did
  nothing but laugh immoderately racey
  grinned foolishly

    if my head didnt ache so hard he
  assured the chortling blacksmith id

batted his eyes and gingerly patted his head

  head ache queried kansas i ex-
pect it might after last night you go give
that hoss back like a good boy

  so saying kansas casey turned his back
and retreated rapidly in the direction of the
starlight saloon

  racey dawson glared vindictively after
the departing deputy then he switched
his angry blue eyes to the blacksmiths
smiling countenance

  you can all said racey dawson dis-
tinctly go plumb to-

he turned the purloined pony
on a dime and loped up the street
followed by the ribald laughter of
piney jackson

  they think theyre so terrible funny


adventure

racey muttered mournfully as he dis-
mounted and tied at the hitch-rail in front
of the happy heart now if i can only
find swing-

  but swing tunstall it appeared on
consulting the bartender had gone off
hunting him-racey the latter did not
appeal to the bartender to divulge the name
of the horses owner he had he believed
furnished the local populace sufficient
amusement for one day he had a small
drink for he felt that he needed a bracer
and with the liquor he imbibed inspiration

  miss blythe mike flynns partner in the
blue pigeon store she would know whose
horse it was for certainly the horses
owner had bought the undershirt and the
stockings at the blue pigeon furthermore
miss blythe looked like a right-minded
individual she would take no pleasure in
deviling a man not she

  racey dawson set down his glass and
hurried to the blue pigeon store miss
blythe at his entrance ceased checking
tomato-cans and came forward

  maam said racey will you come to
the door a minute no no dont be
scared he added as the lady drew back a
step im kind of in trouble an i want
you to help me out im-my names
racey dawson an i used to ride for the
cross-in-a-box before i got a job up at the
bend jack richie knows me i aint
crazy-honest

ful

  i- she began

  lookit he interrupted yesterday i
got a heap drunk an i rode off on some-
bodys hoss without meanin to i mean i
thought it was my hoss an it wasnt an i
thought maybe youd tell me who the hoss

hastily

  pretty miss blythe smiled suddenly

drawing back from the doorway it

fidently he had been at the dales precisely

ter puzzled racey thinking of what

a old maid

straight-faced reply

  shucks i might a knowed it grum-
bled racey middle-aged old maid i

a school-teacher i can feel her lickins yet
she was the contrariest female i ever met
shucks i- well if i gotta i gotta
mights well get it over with now as later
thanks maam for helpin me out

  racey dawson shambled dejectedly forth
to effect the feeding of miss molly dales
horse at the hotel corral for his own
breakfast he went to sing lueys canton
restaurant because while bill lainey
offered no objections to feeding the horse
mrs lainey utterly refused to provide
snacks at odd hours for good-for-nothing
stick-a-bed punchers who were too lazy to
eat at the regular meal-time so there now

  but i aint gonna shave he told him-
self as he disposed of fried steak and pota-
toes sloshed down by several cups of coffee
if shes a old maid like they say it dont
matter how tough i look

he was reflectively stirring the
grounds in the bottom of his sixth
cup when a small and frightened
yellow dog dashed into the restaurant and
fled underneath raceys table where he
cowered next to raceys boots and cuddled
a lop-eared head against raceys knee


the heart of the range



  racey had barely time to glance down
and discover that the yellow nondescript
was no more than a pup when a burly
youth charged into the restaurant and de-
manded in no uncertain tones to know
where that adjective dog had hidden him-
self

  racey took an instant dislike to the burly
youth stilj it was his dog and it is a
custom of the country to let every man as
the saying is skin his own deer he who
takes exception to this custom and horns in
on what can not rightfully be termed his
particular business will find public opinion
dead against him and his journey unsea-
sonably full of incident

  racey moved a leg this him stranger

  the burly youth-it was evident that he
was not wholly sober-glared at racey
dawson

  shore its him he declared what

--you hidin him for get outa the

way

  whereupon the burly youth advanced
upon racey

  this was different oh quite the
burly youth had by his brusk manner and
rude remarks included racey in his-the
burly youths-business

  racey met the burly youth rather more
than half-way he hit him so hard on the
nose that the other flipped backward
through the doorway and landed on his ear
on the sidewalk

  racey followed him out the burly
youth bleeding copiously from the nose
sat up and fumbled uncertainly for his gun

  no said racey with decision aiming
his six-shooter at the word you leave
that gun alone an lemme tell you stranger
while were together that i want to buy that
pup of yores a gent like you aint fit
company for a self-respectin dog to associ-
ate with nawsir

  you got the drop grumbled the burly
youth

  which is one on you racey observed
good-humoredly

  maybe ill be seein you again sug-
gested the other

  dont lemme see you first advised
racey nevermind gettinup just sit
nice an quiet like a good boy ah keep the
lil hands spread out all so pretty with the
thumbs locked over yore head ats the
boy how much for yore dog feller

  what you done to my dog a wo-

mans voice broke on raceys ears but
he did not remove his slightly narrowed
eyes from the face of the burly youth

  what you done to my dog

  the question was repeated and the
speaker came close to the burly youth and
looked down at him now that the woman
was within his range of vision racey per-
ceived that she was the happy heart
lookout a good-looking creature with
brown hair and a lithe figure

  the girls fists were clenched so tightly
that her knuckles showed white against
the pink two red spots flared on the
white skin of her cheeks

  - yore soul swore the lady i

want my dog how many times i gotta
ask yuh huh where is he say some-
thin you dumb lump of slumgullion

  he aint yore dog denied the burly
youth he never was yores hes mine

you-

  which last was putting it pretty strongly
even for the time the place and the girl
she promptly swung a brisk right toe
kicked the burly youth under the chin and
flattened him out

  thatll learn you to call me names she
snarled so long as i act like a lady im
a-gonna be treated like one an ill break
the neck of the man who acts different an
you can stick a pin in that you dirty-
mouthed beast

  muttering profanely true to form the
aforementioned beast essayed to rise but
here again racey and his ready gun held
him to the ground in a sitting position

  you leave her alone commanded
racey you got what was cornin to
yuh let it go at that the lady says its
her dog anyway

  its my dog i tell yuh i-

  yore a liar averred the girl you
kicked the dog out when he was sick an i
took him in an tended him an got him well
if that dont make him my dog what
does

  correct said racey call him
the girl put two fingers in her mouth and
whistled shrilly forth from the canton
came the dog on thejump and bounced into
the girls arms and began to lick her ear
with dispatch and enthusiasm

  you see how it is racey indicated to
the man on the ground its the ladys
dog you can go now

  	the burly youth stared stupidly


adventure

  you heard what i said racey told
him impatiently gon go someers else
get outa here

  say remarked the burly youth in
what was intended to be a menacing growl
this party aint over yet

  aint you been enough of a fool already
today interrupted racey you aint
asking for it are you

  you cant run no blazer on me denied
the other furiously

  racey promptly holstered his six-shooter
nows yore best time he said quietly

when the smoke cleared away
there was a rent in the sleeve of
raceys shirt and the burly youth
sat rocking his body to and fro and groaning
through gritted teeth for there was a red-
hot hole in his right shoulder which hurt
him cansiderably

  racey dawson gazed dumbly down at the
muzzle of his six-shooter from which a slim
curl of gray smoke spiraled lazily upward
then his eyes veered to the man he had
shot and to the mans six-shooter lying on
the edge of the sidewalk it too like his
own gun was thinly smoking at the muzzle
the burly youth put a hand to his shoulder
the fingers came away red racey was
glad he had not killed him he had not
intended to but accidents will happen

  he stepped forward and kicked the burly
youths discarded six-shooter into the mid-
dle of the stfeet he looked about him
the girl and her dog had vanished

  kansas casey had taken her place ap-
parently from windows and doorways
along the street peered interested faces
one knew that they were interested despite
their careful lack of all expression it is
never well openly to express approval of a
shooting the shootee undoubtedly has
friends and little breaches of etiquette are
always remembered

  racey dawson looked at kansas casey
and sbved his six-shooter down into its
holster

  it was a even break announced racey

  shore kansas nodded i seen it
therell be no trouble-from us he added
significantly

  the deputy sheriff knelt beside the
wounded man racey dawson went into
the happy heart he felt that he needed
a drink when he came out five minutes
later the burly youth had been carried

away remained a stain of dark red on the
sidewalk where he had been sitting

  piggy wadsworth the plump owner of
the dance-hall legs wide-spread and arms
akimbo was inspecting the red stain
thoughtfully he was joined by the store-
keeper calloway and two other men
none of them was aware of racey dawson
standing in front of the happy heart

  was it there inquired calloway

  yeah said piggy right there i
seen the whole fraycas racey stood here
an-

  at this point racey dawson went else-
where

chapter iii

a warning

youll have to manage it yoreself
lanpher the manager of the  ranch
was speaking and there was finality in his
tone

  you mean you dont wanna appear in
the deal a-tall sneered his companion

  racey dawson who had been kneeling
on the ground engaged in bandaging a cut
from a kick on the near fore-leg of the dale
pony when the two men led their horses
into the corral craned his neck past the
ponys chest and glanced at lanphers
companion for the latters words pro-
voked curiosity what species of deal
was toward having ridden for lanpher
in the days preceding his employment by
the cross-in-a-box and consequently pro-
vided with many opportunities for studying
the gentleman at arms-length racey
naturally assumed that the deal was a
shady one

  personally he believed lanpher capable
of anything which of course was unjust
to the manager his courage was not quite
sufficient to hold him abreast of the masters
in wickedness but he was mean and cruel
in a slimy way and if left alone was prone
to make life miserable for some one in-
variably the some one was incapable of
proper defense from farewell to marys-
ville throughout the length and breadth
of the great lazy river country lanpher
was known unfavorably and disliked ac-
cordingly

  to his companions sneering remark
lanpher made no intelligible reply he
merely grunted as he reached for the gate
the heart of the range



                                                 

to pull it shut his companion half-
turned-his back had from the first been
toward racey dawson-and racey per-
ceived the cold and roman profile of a
long-jawed head then the man turned
full in his direction and behold the hard
features vanished and the man displayed
a good-looking countenance of singular
charm the chin was a thought too wide
and heavy a trait it shared in common with
the mouth but otherwise the strangers full
face would have found favor in the eyes of
almost any woman however critical

  racey dawson at first minded to reveal
his presence in the corral thought better
of it almost immediately while not by
habit an eavesdropper he felt no shame in
fortuitously overhearing anything lanpher
or the stranger might be moved to say
lanpher merited no consideration under
any circumstances and the stranger in
appearance a similar breed of dog as far
as morals went certainly deserved no better
treatment so racey remained quietly
where he was and was glad that besides
the pony to which he was ministering there
were several others between him and the
men at the gate

  why dont yuh wanna appear in this
business persisted the stranger pivoting
on one heel in order to keep face to face with
lanpher

  i gotta live here was the lanpher
reply

  well aint i gotta live here too an
i dont see anythin round here to worry
me spose old chin whisker does go on
the prod what can he do

   tsall right mumbled lanpher shut-
ting the gate and shoving home the bar
you dont know this country as well as
i do i got trouble enough runnin the
 without borrowin any more

  now i told yuh i was gonna get his
lil ranch peaceable if i could i got it
all planned out i dont do anythin rough
unless i gotta but im gonna get old chin
whisker out o there an you can stick a
pin in that	

  tsall right tsall right you wanna
remember ol chin whisker aint the only
hoss yore trvin to ride if you think that
other outfit is gonna watch you pick daisies
in their front yard without doin anythin
you got another guess but ill do what i
said an no more

  i spose you think that by stickin away

off yonder where the grass is long nobody
will suspicion you if you do yore crazy
folks aint so cross-brained as all that
yore in it from soda to hock an dont
you forget it

  not so - loud lanpher cautioned

excitedly

  say whatsa matter with you de-
manded the stranger leaning back against
the gate and spreading his long arms along
the top bar which yore the most
nervous gent i ever did see the hotel
aint close enough for anybody to hear a
word an theres only hosses in the corral
get a-hold of yoreself dont be so skit-
tish

  i aint skittish im sensible i know-
lanpher broke off abruptly

  whadda you know

  what yore due to find out

  now lookit here mr lanpher said
the stranger in a low cold tone you said
them last words a leetle too gayful to suit
me if yore plannin any deviltry-
dont

  i aint not a bit of it but i got my
duty to my company i cant get mixed
up in no fraycas on yore account because if
i do my ranch will lose money thats
the flat of it

  oh it is huh yore ranch will lose
money if you back me up hey an you
aint thinkin nothin of yore precious skin
are yuh oh no not q-tall i wonder
what yore company would say to the lil
deal between you an me that started this
business i wonder what theyd think o
mr lanpher an his sense o duty yeah
i would wonder a whole lot

  well- began lanpher lamely

  - snarled the stranger you

make me sick now you listen to me
yore in this as deep as i am if you think
you aint try to pull yore wagon out just
try thassall

  i aint doin none of the work thats
flat lanpher denied doggedly

  you gotta back me up alia same de-
clared the stranger

  that wasnt in the bargain fenced
lanpher

  it is now chuckled the stranger if
i lose you lose too lookit he added in
a more conciliatory tone cant you see
how it is i need you an you need me
all im askin of you is to back me up when
i want yuh to outside o that yuh can


adventure

sit on yore shoulder-blades an enjoy life
wc didnt bargain on that barked back
lanpher

  but that was then an this is now
which may not be logic but it is necessity
an necessity mr lanpher is the mother
of all kinds of funny things so you an i
we got to ride together

  lanpher pushed back his hat and looked
over the hills and far away the well-
known carking care was written large upon
his countenance slowly his eyes slid
round to meet for a brief moment the eyes
of his companion

  i cant answer for my men said lan-
pher shortly

  can you answer for yoreself inquired
the stranger quickly

  ill back you up grudgingly

  then thats all right you can keep
the men from throwin in with the other
side anyway cant yuh

  i can do that much

  which is quite a lot for a ranch manager
to be able to do was the strangers blandly
sarcastic observation cmon weve

fassed so much im dry as a covered bridge
-what does thompson want now lo
punch

   lo jack howdy lanpher racey
could not see the newcomer but he recog-
nized the voice it was that of punch-the-
breeze thompson a gentleman well known
to make his living by the ingenious capitali-
zation of an utter lack of moral virtue
say jack continued thompson ne-
braska has been plugged

  plugged great amazement on the
part of the stranger

  plugged

  who done it

  feller by the name of dawson
  racev dawson nipped in lanpher
  yeah him

  lanpher chuckled slightly

  why the laugh asked jack harpe
id always thought nebraska could
shoot

  nebraska is supposed to be some swift
admitted the stranger howd it happen
punch

  thampson told him and on the whole
gave a truthful account

what kind o feller is this dawson
the stranger inquired after a moments
silence following the close of the story
a skipjack of a no-account cow-wrast-

ler promptly replied lanpher he thinks

hes-on the wabash

  allasame he must be old pie to put the
kibosh on nebraska thataway

luck sneered lanpher just luck
is he square probed the stranger
square as a billiard-ball said lanpher
why jack hes so crooked he cant lay
in bed straight

  at which racey dawson was moved to
rise and declare himself then the humor
of it struck him he grinned and hunkered
down his ears on the stretch

  well said the stranger refraining
from comment on lanphers estimate of the
dawson qualities well have to get some-
body in nebraskas place

  im as good as nebraska punch-the-
breeze thompson stated modestly

  no the stranger said decidedly yore
all right punch but even if we can get
old chin whisker drunk the hand has
gotta be quicker than the eye y under-
stand

  thompson it appeared did understand
he grunted sulkily

  well have to give peaches austin a
show resumed the stranger nev mine
givin me a argument punch i said id
use austin cmon les go get a drink

     the three men moved away
riilll racey dawson cautiously eased
his long body up from behind the
pony with slightly narrowed eyes he
stared at the gate behind which jack
harpe and his two friends had been stand-
ing

  now i wonder mused racey dawson
i shore am wonderin what kind of skul-
duggery lil mr lanpher of the  is a-
tryin to crawl out of an what mr stranger
is a-tryin to drag him into nebraska
too huh i was wonderin what that fel-
lers name was

  he knelt down again and swiftly com-
pleted the bandaging of the cut on the
ponys near fore-leg as he rode round
the corner of the hotel to reach main
street he saw luke tweezy single-footing
into town from the south the powdery
dust of the trail filled in and overlaid the
lines and creases of luke tweezys foxy-
nosed and leathery visage layers of dust
almost completely concealed the original
color of the caked and matted hide of luke
tweezys well-conditioned horse it was
the heart of the range



evident that luke tweezy had come from
afar

  in common with most range-riders racey
dawson possessed an automatic eye to
detail quite without conscious effort his
brain registered and filed away in the card-
index of his subconscious mind the picture
presented by the passing of luke tweezy
the impression made thereby and the in-
ference drawn therefrom

  the inference was almost trivial-merely
that luke tweezy had come from marys-
ville the town where he lived and had his
being but triviality is frequently para-
doxical and always relative if dundee
had not raised an arm to urge his troopers
on at killiekrankie the world would know
a different england a single thread it was
that solved for theseus the mystery of the
cretan labyrinth

  racey dawson did not like luke tweezy
from the sparse and sandy strands of the
tweezy hair to the long and varied lines of
the tweezy business there was nothing
about mr tweezy that he did like for
luke tweezys business was ready money
and its possibilities he drove hard bar-
gains with his neighbors and harder ones
with strangers he bought county scrip
at a liberal discount and lent his profits
to the needy at the highest rate allowed by
law

  luk tweezys knowledge of what was
allowed by territorial law was not limited
to money-lending he had been admitted
to the bar and no case was too small too
large or too filthy for him to handle

  in his dislike of luke tweezy racey
dawson was not solitary luke tweezy
was as generally unpopular as lanpher of
the  but there was a difference where
lanphers list of acquaintances nodding
and otherwise was necessarily confined to
the lazy river country luke tweezy
knew almost every man woman and child
in the territory it was his business to
know everybody and luke tweezy was
always attending to his business

  he had nodded and spoken to racey
dawson as they two passed and racey
had returned the greeting gravely

  slimy ol he-buzzard racey dawson
observed to himself and reached for his
tobacco

  but there was no tobacco the sack
that he knew he had put in his vest pocket
after breakfast had vanished lack of

tobacco is a serious matter racey wheeled
his mount and spurred to the blue rigeon
store

  five minutes later smoking a grateful
cigaret he again started to ride out of town
as he curved his horse round a freight-
wagon in front of the blue pigeon he saw
three men issue from the doorway of the
happy heart saloon two of the men were
lanpher and the stranger the third was
luke tweezy the latter stopped at the
saloon hitching-rail to untie his horse

  see yuh later luke the stranger
flung over his shoulder to luke tweezy as
he passed on he and lanpher headed
diagonally across the street toward the
hotel it seemed odd to racey dawson
that luke tweezy by no word or sign made
acknowledgment of the strangers remark

  racey tickled his mount with the rowels
of one spur and stirred him into a trot
have to be moving along if he wanted to
get there some time that day he wished
he didnt have to go alone so he did the
old lady would surely lay him out and he
wished for company to share his misery

  why couldnt swing tunstall have stayed
reasonably in farewell instead of traips-
ing off over the range like a tomfool might
not be back for a week swing mightnt
idiotic caper-with other adjectives-of
swings anyway why hadnt he used his
head oh racey dawson was an exceed-
ingly irritable young man as he rode out of
farewell the aches and pains were still
throbbingly alive in his own particular
head the immediate future was not al-
luring it was a hard world

  when he and his mount were breasting
the first slight rise of the northern slope of
indian ridge-which ridge marks with its
long broad-backed bulk the southern bound-
ary of the flats south of farewell and forces
the marysville trail totravel five miles to
go two-a rider emerged from a small
boulder-strewn draw wherein tamajacks
grew thinly

  racey stared-and forgot his irritation
and his headache the draw was not more
than a quarter-mile distant and he per-
ceived without difficulty that the rider was
a woman she quirted her mount into a
gallop and then seesawed her right arm
vigorously above the pattering drum of
her horses hoofs a shout came faintly to
his ears he pulled up and waited

  when the woman was close to him he


adventure

saw that it was the good-looking brown-
haired happy heart lookout the girl
whose dog he had protected she dragged
her horse to a halt at his side and smiled
and oddly enough it was an amazingly
sweet smile it had nothing in common
with the hard smile of her profession

  im sorry i had to leave without thank-
in yuh for what yuh done for me back
there said she with a jerk of her head to-
ward distant farewell

  why thats all right racey told her
awkwardly

  it meant a lot to me she went on her
smile fading you wouldnt let that feller
hurt me or my dog an i think the world
of that dog

  yeah thus racey very much em-
barrassed by her gratitude and quite at a
loss as to the proper thing to say

  yes an im shore grateful stranger
i-i wont forget it that dog he likes
me he does an im teachin him tricks
hes awful cunnin an company say
when im feelin rotten that there dog
knows an he climbs up in my lap an licks
my ear an tries his best to be a comfort
i tell yuh that dog likes me an that means
a whole lot-to me i-i aint forgettin
it

  her face was dark red she dropped her
head and began to fumble with her reins
you neednt a come ridin alia way
out here just for this chided racey feel-
ing that he must say something to relieve
the situation

  it wasnt only this she denied tiredly
they was somethin else an i couldnt
talk to yuh in farewell without him an
his friends findin it out thats why i
borrowed one o mike flynns hosses an
followed yuh thisaway-sos we could be
private les ride along i expect you
was goin somewhere

they rode southward side by side
a space of time in silence racey
had nothing to say he was too
busy speculating as to the true significance
of the girls presence what did she want-
money

  these saloon floozies always did he
hoped she wouldnt want much for he
ruefully knew himself to be a soft-hearted
fool that was never able to resist a womans
appeal he glanced at her covertly her
little chin was trembling poor kid that

was all she was just a kid fierce life for a
kid shucks

  lookit here said racey suddenly
you in hard luck huh dont yuh worry
yore luck is bound to turn it always
does how much yuh want

  so saying he slid a hand into a side
pocket of his trousers the girl shook her
head without looking at him

  it aint money she said dully i
make enough to keep me goin then
with a curious flash of temper she con-
tinued

  thats always the way with a man
aint it if he thinks yore in trouble-
give her some money if yore sick-
give her money if yore dyin-give her
money money money money im
so sick o money i- dont mind me
stranger i dont mean nothin im a-a
lil upset today i- its hard for me to
begin

  begin what was the girl driving at
yes said she begin its hard i
aint no snitch i never was even when i
hadnt no use for a man-like now but-
but you stuck up for me an my dog an
i gotta pay you back i gotta listen
she pursued swiftly do you know who
that feller was you shot

  no racey shook his head but you
dont owe me nothin forget it i dunno
what yore drivin at an i dont wanna
know if it bothers yuh to tell me but if
i can do anythin-anythin a-tall to help
yuh why then tell me

  i know she nodded youd always
help a feller yore that kind but im
all right that jigger you plugged is tom
jones

  the girl looked at racey dawson as
though the name of tom jones should be
informative of much but fieldings ex-
cluded there are many tom joneses
racey did not react

  dunno him said racey dawson i
heard his name was nebraska

  nebraska the boys called him she
amplified he used to be foreman of the
currycomb outfit south of fort seymour
ive heard o nebraska jones an the
currycomb bunch all right he admitted
soberly an id shore like to know
what was the matter with nebraska today
so would i you was lucky

  racey nodded absently the curry-
comb outfit that charming aggregation
the heart of the range



of gunfighters had borne the hardest repu-
tation extant in a neighboring territory
regarding the currycomb men had been
accustomed to speak behind their hands
and under their breaths for the curry-
comb politically had been a power which
perhaps was the reason why although the
rustling of many and many a cow and the
killing of more than one man were laid at
their unfriendly door nothing had ever
been proved against them

  they had prospered exceedingly these
currycomb boys till the election of an
opposition sheriff which election had put
heart into the more decent set and a crimp
in the currycomb it did not matter that
legally the currycomb possessed a clean
bill of health the community had decided
that the currycomb must be abolished it
was-cow cayuse and cowboy

  while some had remained on the prem-
ises at an approximate depth beneath the
grass of two feet-for the ground was hard-
the other currycombers had scattered wide
and far and their accustomed places knew
them no more

  now it seemed that at least one of the
currycomb boys and that one the most
notorious character of the lot had scattered
as far as farewell and obtruded his per-
sonality upon that of racey dawson ne-
braska jones a cold smile stretched the
corners of raceys mouth as he thought
on what he had done he had beaten to
the draw the foreman of the currycomb
which undoubtedly must have been the
first time nebraska had ever been shaded

  the girl was watching his face dont
begin to get the notion you beat him to it
she advised divining his thought lie
was stunned sort of that first time an the
second time his gun caught a little ne-
braska is slow lightnin on the pull keep
thinkin you was lucky like you doneat first

  racey laughed shamefacedly yore
too much of a mind-reader for me but
what you tellin all this to me for i aint
the sheriff with a warrant for nebraska
jones

  im tellin yuh so yuhll know what to
expect so yuhll get out of town an stay
out cause shore as yore a foot high
you wont live a minute longer than is
plumb necessary if you dont

  i beat nebraska once an he wont
get well o that lead in the shoulder so
jo-awful soon

  can you beat a shot in the dark can
you locate a knife in the night it aint
a question of nebraska jones himself its
the gang hes managed to pick up in this
town they are meaner than a nest of
cross rattlesnakes i know em i know
what theyll do right this minute theyre
fixin up some way to give yuh yore come-
uppance

  think so

  think so say would i come traipsin
out here just for my health or yores figure
it out

  seems like you know a lot about
nebraska an his gang he said at a ven-
ture glancing at her sharply

  i lived with nebraska-for a while she
said matter-of-factly giving him a calm
stare lil marie knows all they is to
know about nebraska jones-an a little
bit more which goes double for his
gang

  shucks racey grunted contemptu-
ously does he an his gang run farewell
id always thought farewell was a mans
size town

  theyre careful explained the girl
they got sense enough not to run any
blazers they cant back to the limit yeah
theyre careful-now

  now huh later when theyve filled
their hands an theres more of em playin
they might not be so careful huh marie
unless yore a heap careful right now
you wont have a thing to do with later 
she parried you do like i say mister
man i aint a bit anxious to see you wiped
out

  wipin me out would shore cramp my

style he admitted i-

  at this juncture hoof-beats sounded
sharply on the trail behind them racey
turned in a flash his right hand dropping
but it was only lanpher and the stranger
riding out of a belt of pines whose deep and
lusty soughing had drowned the noise of
their approach

bbh lanpher and his comrade rode
by at a trot the former mumbled
a greeting to racey but barely
glanced at the girl women did not inter-
est lanpher he was too selfishly stingy
the stranger was more appreciative he
gave the girl a stare of frank admiration
before he looked at racey dawson the
latter perceived that the strangers eyes


adventure

were remarkably black and keen perceived
too that the man as he rode past
half-turned in the saddle for a second look
at the girl

  whos yore friend asked marie an
insolent lift to her upper lip and a slightly
puzzled look in her brown eyes as her gaze
followed the stranger and lanpher

  friend said racey speakin per-
sonal now i aint lost either of em

  i know who lanpher is she told him
impatiently i meant the other

  ill never tell yuh i dunno him

  i think ive seen him somewhere-
some time i cant remember where or
how-i see so many men- there i al-
most had it gone again now dont it
make yuh sick when things get away from
you like that makes yuh think yore
a-losin yore mind almost

  he looked at you almighty strong
proffered racey maybe hell remember
why dont yuh ask him

  maybe i will at that said she

  didja know he was a friend of nebras-
kas he asked watching her face keenly
she shook her head

  nebraska knows a lot of folks she
said indifferently

  he knows punch-the-breeze thompson
too

  likely he would knowin nebraska he
belongs to nebraskas bunch

  what does nebraska do for a livin
everbody an anythin mostly he
deals a game in the starlight

  what does peaches austin work at
he pursued thinking that it might be well
to learn what he could of the enemys
habits

  he deals another game in the happy
heart

   the hand is quicker than the eye 
he quoted cynically recalling what the
stranger had said to punch-the-breeze
thompson

  oh peaches is slick enough said she
comprehending instantly but nebraska
is slicker dont never sit into no game
with nebraska jones lookit here she
added her expression turning suddenly
anxious did i take my ride for nothin
huh oh that shore not im obliged
to yuh you bet yuh an i hope i can do as
much for you some day but i wasnt
figurin on stayin here any length of time
swing-hes my friend-an me are goin

down to try arizona a spell well be
pullin out tomorrow i expect

  then all you got to look out for is to-
night but im tellin yuh yuh better drag

  racey smiled slowly if it wasnt i
got business down south id admire to stay
i aint leavin a place just cause i aint
popular not nohow im over twenty-one
i got my growth

  it dont matter why yuh go yore
a-goin thats enough its a good thing
for you you got business an you can stick
a pin in that

  ill have to do somethin about them
friends of his alia same before i go
racey said thoughtfully

  huh perplexedly

  yeah if theyre a-hornin to bush-
whack me for what i done to nebraska it
aint fair for me to go siftin off thisaway an
not give em some kind of a run for their
alley look at it close you can see it
aint

  i dont see nothin

  shore yuh do it would give em too
much of a chance to talk they might even
get to sayin they run me out o town an
the more i think of it the more im shore
theyll be sayin just that

  but you said you was goin away you
said you had business in arizona

shore i have an shore im goin but
first i gotta give nebraskas friends a chance
to draw cards a chance y understand

lipped

  why no said he not never a-tall
drawin cards is one thing an playin the
hand out is a cat with another kind of tail
i got hopes they wont get too rough with

me

  well of all the stubborn fools i ever
see- began the girl angrily

  at which racey dawson laughed aloud
thats all right she snapped you
can laugh might a knowed you would
a man is such a plumb idjit a feller does
all she can to show him the right trail out
an does he take it he does not he
laughs thats what he does he laughs
he thinks its funny you gimme a pain
you do

  on the instant she jerked her pony
round whirled her quirt cross-handed and
tore down the back-trail at full gallop

  aw - said racey looking after
the heart of the range



the fleeing damsel regretfully i clean
forgot to ask her about the rest of nebras-
kas friends

chapter iv

the old lady

iltope old man dale is home said
l l racey to himself when he saw ahead
of him the grove of cottonwoods marking
the location of moccasin spring but
he wont be he added lugubriously i
never did have no luck

   he passed the grove of trees and opened
up the prospect of house and stable and
corral with cottonwood and willow-bordered
soogan creek in the background

   changed some since i was here last
he muttered in wonder for nesters as a
rule do not go in for flowers and shrubs
and here besides a small truck-garden
were both-all giving evidence of much care
and attention

   racey dismounted at the corral and ap-
proached the kitchen door a fresh young
voice in the kitchen was singing a song to
the brave accompaniment of a twanging
banjo

    when i was a-goin down the road
    with a tired team an a heavy load

    i cracked my whip an the leader sprung

   an he almost busted the wagon-tongue
   turkey in the straw ha ha ha

  turkey in-

   the singing stopped in the middle of a
line the banjo went silent in the middle
of a bar racey looked in at the kitchen
door and saw sitting on a corner of the
kitchen table a very pretty girl one
knee was crossed over the other in her lap
was the mute banjo and she was looking
straight at him

   racey heartily and internally cursing
himself for having neglected to shave
pulled off his hat and achieved a head-
bob

   good morning said the pretty girl
putting up a slim tanned hand and tucking
in behind a well-set ear a strayed lock of
black hair

   mornin said racey and decided
then and there that he had never before
seen eyes of such a deep deep blue or a
mouth so alluringly red

   what said the pretty girl laying the
banjo on the table and sliding down till

her feet touched the floor what can i do

for you

  nun-nothin stuttered the rattled
racey clasping his hat to his bosom so
that he could button unseen the top button
of his shirt except cuc-can yuh find miss
dale for me is she home

  mothers out sos father im the
only one home

  its yore sister i want miss dale-
yore oldest sister

  you must mean mrs morgan she
lives-

  no i dont mean her yore oldest
sister-miss her whose hoss was took by
mistake in farewell yesterday

  that was my horse

  yores but they said it was a old ladys

hoss are you shore it-

  of course im sure did you bring
him back where the corral

  the girl walked swiftly to the window
took one glance at the bay horse tied to the
corral gate and returned to the table

  certainly thats my horse she reiter-
ated with the slightest of smiles

  racey dawson stared at her in horror
her horse he had actually run off with
the horse of this beautiful being he had
thereby caused inconvenience to this angel
if he could only crawl off somewhere and
pass away quietly at the moment by
his own valuation any one buying him
for a nickel would have been liberally over-
charged her horse

  i-i took yore hoss he spoke up
desperately im racey dawson

  so youre the man- she began and
stopped

  he nodded miserably his contrite eyes
on the toes of her shoes small shoes they
were cheerfully would he have lain down
right there on the floor and let her wipe
those self-same shoes upon him it would
have been a positive pleasure he felt so
worm-like he almost wriggled slowly oh
very slowly he lifted his eyes to her face

  i-i was drunk he confessed hoping
that an honest confession would restrain
her from casting him into outer darkness

  i heard you were she admitted

  i thought it was yore oldest sisters
pony he fumbled on feeling it incunfibent
upon him to say something they told
me somethin about a old lady

  jane morgans the only older sister i
have who told you this wild tale


adventure

  them was his vague reply he was
not the man to give away the jokers of
farewell old lady indeed miss blythe
to the contrary notwithstanding this girl
was not within sight of middle-age

  yeah he went on they shore fooled
me told me id took a old maids hoss

  oh as far as that goes said the girl
hr long eyelashes demurely drooping they
told you the truth im an old maid
you shucks hugely contemptuous
oh but i am she insisted raising her
eyes and tilting sidewise her charming head
im not married

  thank- he began impulsively but
choked on the second word and gulped hard
i mean he resumed hastily i dont
understand why i never seen you before
i was here once but you wasnt around
when were you here why that was
two years ago i was only a kid then-all
legs like a calf no wonder you didnt
notice me

  she laughed at him frankly with a be-
wildering flash of white teeth

  i shore must a been blind he said
truthfully they aint no two ways about
that

  under his admiring gaze a slow blush
overspread her smooth cheeks she laughed
again-uncertainly and burst into swift
speech

  my manners what have i been think-
ing of mr dawson please sit down do
i know you must be tired after your long
ride take that chair under the mirror
its the strongest you can tip it back
against the wall if you like ill get you
a cup of coffee i know youre thirsty
im sorry mother and father arent home
but mother drove over to the bar s on
business and i dont know where father
went

  i aint fit to stay hesitated racey
rasping the back of his hand across his stub-
bly chin

  nonsense you sit right down while i
grind the coffee ill have you a potful
in no time i make pretty good coffee if
i do say it myself

  ill bet you do

  but my sister jane makes better
youll get some of hers at dinner
dinner he stared blankly

  of course dinner when mother and
father are away i always go down there

for my meals its only a quarter-mile
down-stream shorter if you climb that
ridge but its so stony i generally go
along the creek-bank where i can gallop-
what why of course youre going with
me jane would never forgive me if i
didnt bring you

  and what would chuck say if you came
this far and then didnt go on down to his
house dont you suppose he enjoys see-
ing his old friends it was only last week
i heard him wonder to father if you were
ever coming back to this country how
did you like it up at the bend

  right fine he told her settling him-
self comfortably in the chair she had in-
dicated but a feller gets tired of one
place after a while i thought maybe id
come back to the lazy river an get a job
ridin the range again

  arent there any ranches round the
bend she asked poking up the fire and
setting on the coffee-pot

  plenty but i-i like the lazy river
country he told her fort creek county
for yores truly now an hereafter

  in this fashion did the proposed journey
to arizona go glimmering his eye lingered
on the banjo where it lay on the table

  can you play it she asked her eye
following his

  some said he wanna hear a camp-
meetin song

  she nodded he rose and picked up the
banjo he placed a foot on the chair
seat slid the banjo to rest on his thigh
swept the strings and broke into inchin
along which ditty made her laugh
for it is a funny song and he sang it well

  that was fine she told him when he
had sung it through your voice sounds
a lot like that of a man i heard singing in
farewell yesterday he was in the happy
heart when i was going by and he sang
jog on jog on the footpath way if it
hadnt been a saloon id have gone in i
just love the old songs

  you do said he delightedly with
shining sves well miss dale that feller
in he saloon was me an old songs is where

i	live i cut my teeth on the barley
mow an grew up with barbara allen
my mother she used to sing em all she
was a great hand to sing an she taught me
know the keel row

  she didnt so he sang it for her and
others he sang too the merry cuckoo
the heart of the range



and the bailiffs daughter the last
she liked so well that he sang it three times
over and they quite forgot the coffee

      racey dawson was starting
  j the second verse of sourwood
 mountain when some one without
coughed apologetically racey stopped sing-
ing and looked toward the doorway stand-
ing on the sunken half-round log that served
as a door-step was the stranger he had seen
with lanpher

  there was more than a hint of amuse-
ment in the black eyes with which the
stranger was regarding racey the latter
felt that the stranger was enjoying a hearty
internal laugh at his expense as probably
he was racey looked at him from be-
neath level brows

  the lid of the strangers right eye dropped
ever so little it was the merest of winks
yet it was unmistakable it recalled their
mornings meeting more it was the toler-
ant wink of a superior to an inferior a
wink that merited a kick quite so

  the keen black eyes veered from racey
to the girl the man removed his hat and
bowed with it must be said not a little
grace miss dale nodded coldly the
stranger smiled it was marvelous how
the magic of that smile augmented the at-
tractive good looks of the strangers full
face it was equally singular how that self-
same smile rendered more hawk-like than
ever the hard and roman profile of the
fellow it was precisely as if he were two
different men at one and the same time

  does mr dale live here inquired the
stranger

  he does a breath from the boreal
pole was in the two words uttered by miss
dale

  the strangers smile widened the keen
black eyes began to twinkle he made as
if to enter but went no farther than the
placing of one foot on the door-sill

  is he home

  he isnt clear and colder

  im shore serry grieved the stranger
the smile waning a trifle i wanted to
see him

  i supposed as much sniffed miss dale
uncordiafly

  yes miss said the stranger undis-
turbed when will he be back if i might
ask

  tonight-tomorrow im not sure

  so i see nodded the stranger would
it be worth while my waitin

  that depends on what you call worth
while

  yore right it does standards aint
always alike are they

  he laughed silently and pulled on his
hat

  an its a good thing standards aint
all alike he resumed chattily wouldnt
it be a funny old world if they were

  the smile of him recognized racey
briefly but it rested upon and caressed the
girl she shook her shoulders as if she were
ridding herself of the touch of hands

  the stranger continued to smile and to
look as if he expected a reply but he did
not get it miss dale stared calmly at him
through him

  slowly the stranger slid his foot from
the door-sill to the door-step slowly very
slowly his keenly twinkling black gaze
traveled over the girl from her face to her
feet and up again finally to fasten upon and
hold as with a tangible grip her angry blue
eyes

  im sorry yore pa aint here said he in
a drawl i had some business it can
wait ill be back so long

  the stranger turned and left them
from the kitchen window they watched
him mount his horse and ford the creek and
ride away westward

i dont like that man declared miss
dale and caught her lower lip between her
white teeth i wonder what he wanted
youll find out when he comes back
dryly

  i hope he never comes back i never
want to see him again do you know him
not me first time i ever saw him was
this mornin in farewell he was with
lanpher when i was cornin out here him
an lanpher caught up with me an passed
me

  he didnt bring lanpher here with him
anyhow

  he didnt for a fact assented racey
dawson his eyes following the dwindling
figures of the rider and his horse i
wonder why

  i wonder too thus miss dale with
a gurgling chuckle

both laughed for raceys sole visit to
the dale place had been made in company
with lanpher the cause of said visit had
been the rustling and butchering of an 
-

adventure

cow which lanpher had ill-advisedly
essayed to fasten upon mr dale but
due to the interference of chuck morgan a
bar s rider who later married jane dale
lanphers attempt had ben unavailing it
may be said in passing that lanpher had
suffered both physically and mentally be-
cause of that visit of course he had
neither forgiven chuck morgan nor the
bar s for backing up its puncher which it
had done to the limit

  i quit the  that day racey dawson
told the girl

  i know you did chuck told me look
at the time will you get your jiat we
mustnt keep jane waiting

  no he said thoughtfully his brows
puckered we mustnt keep jane waitin
lookit miss dale as i remember yore pa
he had a mustache has he still got it

  miss dale puzzled paused in the door-
way

  why no she told him he wears a
horrid chin whisker now

  he does huh a chin whisker lets
be movin right along i think i got some-
thin interestin to tell you an yore sister
an chuck

but they didnot move along they
halted in the doorway or rather
the girl halted in the doorway and
racey looked over her shoulder what
stopped them short in their tracks was a
spectacle-the spectacle of an elderly chin-
whiskered man very drunk and disorderly
riding in on a paint pony

  father breathed miss dale in a horror-
stricken whisper

  and as she spoke father uttered a string
of cheerful whoops and topped off with a
long pull at a bottle he had been brandishing
in his right hand

  please go said miss dale to racey
dawson

  he hesitated he was in a quandary
he did not relish leaving her with- at
that instant mr dale decided raceys
course for him mr dale pulled a gun and
still whooping cheerily shook five shots into
the atmosphere then mr dale fuipblingly
threw out his cylinder and began to reload

  i better get his gun away from him
racey said apologetically over his shoulder
as he ran forward

  but the old man would have none of him
he cunningly discerned an enemy in racey

  and tried to shoot him it was luck for
racey that the old fellow was as drunk as a
fiddle or certainly racey would have been
buried the next day as it was the first
bullet went wide by a yard the second
went straight up into the blue for by then
racey had the old mans wrist

  there there soothed racey you
dont want that gun nawsir not you
les have it thats a good feller

  so speaking he twisted the six-shooter
from the old mans grasp and jammed it
into the waistband of his own trousers

  the old man burst into frank tears in-
continently he slid sidewise from the saddle
and clasped racey round the neck

im wild an woolly an full o fleas

im hard to curry below the knees

  thus he caroled loudly two lines of the
justly popular song

  luke he bawled switching from verse
to prose why didja leave me luke
strangely enough he did not stutter
without the slightest difficulty he leaped
that pitfall of the drunken the letter l

  luke repeated racey dawson struck
by a sudden thought whats this about
luke you mean luke tweezy

  the ojfl man rubbed his shaving-brush
a-down raceys neck-muscles i mean
luke tweezy he said lots o folks
dont like luke they say hes mean but
they aint nothin mean about luke hes
frien o mine luke is

  mr dawson said molly dale at
raceys elbow please go i can get him
into the house you can do no good here
i can do lots o good here declared
racey who felt sure that he was on the
verge of a discovery somebody is a-
tryin to jump yore ranch an if youll
lemme talk to him i can find out who
it is

  who--how- said miss dale stupidly
for what with the fright and embarrass-
ment engendered by her fathers condition
the true significance of raceys remark was
not immediately apparent

  yore ranch repeated racey sharply
theyre a-tryin to steal it from you you
lemme talk to him maam look out
grab his bridle

  miss dale seized the bridle of her fathers
horse in time to prevent a runaway she
was not aware that the horses attempt to
run away had been inspired by racey
the heart of the range



surreptitiously and severely kicking it on the
fetlock this he had done that miss dales
thoughts might be temporarily diverted
from her father anything to keep her
from shooing him away as she so plainly
wished to do

  racey began to assist the now crumpling
mr dale toward the house

  whats this about luke tweezy prod-
ded racey did yuh see him today

  shore i seen him today burbled the
drunken one he left me at mcflukes
after buyin me the bottle an asked me to
stay there till he got back but i got tired
waitin so i come along i-hie-come
along

  limply the mans whole weight sagged
down against raceys supporting arm and
he began to snore

  shucks muttered racey

  then stooping he picked up the limp
body in his arms and carried it to the
house

  hes asleep he called to miss dale
wherell i put him

  ill show you she said with a break
in her voice

  she hastily tied the now quiet pony to
a young cottonwood growing at the corner
of the house and preceded racey into the
kitchen

  here she said her eyes meeting his
a fleeting instant as she threw open a door
giving into an inner room on the bed

  she turned back the counterpane and
racey laid her snoring parent on the blanket
expertly he pulled off the mans boots and
stood them side by side against the wall

  hadda take em off now or his feet
would swell so after youd never get em
off he said in justification of his conduct

  she held the door open for him to leave
the room she did not look at him nor
did she speak

   im goin now he said standing in the
middle of the kitchen but i wish you
wouldnt shut that door just yet

  i-oh cant you see youre not wanted
here her voice was shaking the door
was open but a crack he could not see her

  i know he said gently but you
dont understand how serious this business
is i had good reason for believin that
somebody is tryin to steal yore ranch
from several things yore dad said im
shorer than ever if i could only talk to
yuh a lil while

  at this she came forth her eyes were
downcast her cheeks were red with
shamed blood she leaned against the
table one closed fist rested on the top
of the table the knuckles showed white
she was trembling a little

  where an what is mcflukes he
asked

  oh thats where he got it she ex-
claimed bitterly

  i guess if you wouldnt mind tellin
me where mcflukes is maam

  its a little saloon an store on the
marysville road at the lazy river ford
its new since my time then

   its been in operation maybe a year and
a half what makes you think some one
is trying to steal our ranch

  lots o things he told her briskly
but they aint gonna do it if i can help
it dont you fret it will all come out
right shore it will cant help it

  but tell me how-what you know she
demanded

   i havent time now unless yore cornin
with me to see chuck

  i cant-now

then you ask chuck later ill tell
him all about it you ask him so long
racey hurried out to where he had left
his horse he swung into the saddle and
spurred away down-stream

chapter v

mcflukes

hphey been after him to sell a long
time said chuck morgan rolling
him a cigaret as he and racey dawson
jogged along toward mcflukes at the ford
of the lazy

  who asked racey

  i dunno cant find out luke tweezy
is the agent an he wont give the partys
name

   has old salt tried to buy him out
not as i know of why should he
he knows he wont sell to anybody

  have they been after you too

  not yet dad dales the lad they want
special my ranch would be a good thing
but it aint noways necessary like dales
is to anybody startin a big brand lookit
the way dales lays right across the valley
between them two ridges like a cork in a
bottle a mile wide here twenty mile away
g

adventure

between funeral slue an cabin hill shes
a good thirty mile wide-one crackin big
triangle of the best grass in the territory
all free range but without dales section
an his water-rights to begin with what
good is it

  not much conceded racey

  an nobody would dast to start a brand
between funeral slue an cabin hill
pursued chuck free range or not it as
good as belongs to the bar s

  old salt used to run quite a bunch
round cabin hill an another north near
the slue

  he does yet-one or two thousand head
in all maybe oh these fellers aint foolish
enough to crowd old salt that close they
know dales is their best chance

  raceys eyes traveled from one ridge to
the other

  how come they allowed dale to take
up a six-forty he inquired

  they didnt was the answer the
section is made up of four claims hisn
janes mollys an mis dales but theyre
proved up now an made over to him all
regular thats how come

  aint silvertip ransom an long oscar
got a claim someers over yonder on dales
land inquired racey looking toward the
northerly ridge

  they had but they got discouraged an
sold out to dale the same time slippery
wilson an his wife traded in their claims
on the other side of the ridge to old salt
an tom loudon none of ems worth
nothin though

  racey nodded dale ever drink much
was his next question

  he used to before he come here but
he took the cure an quit todays the
first bust-up hes had since he hit this
country

  thats it then luke gave him the
red-eye sos hed be easy meat for the
butcher does he ever gamble any
shore-before he came west jane done
told me how back east in mcpherson
kansas he used to go the limit forty ways-

liquor cards the whole layout o -

raisin but his habits rode him to a frazzle
final an he knuckled under to tooberclosis
an they only saved his life by fetchin him
west all of us thought he was cured for
good

  now luke tweezy has started him off
sos nebraska-peaches austin i mean

can get in his fine work its plain enough
shore assented chuck morgan yon-
ders mcflukes he added nodding to-
ward two gray-brown log and shake shacks
anda stockaded corral roosting on the high
ground beyond the belt of cottonwoods and
willows marking the course of the lazy
thems his stables and corral went on
chuck the house shes down near the
river cant see her on account of the
cottonwoods

  an they cant see us on account of the

cottonwoods so-

   unless hes at the corral

  illtake the chance chuck you stay
here down that draws a good place ill
go on alone mcfluke dont know me
maybe i can find out somethin see bime-
by you come along-half-hour maybe you
dont know me either ill get into con-
versation with yuh you follow my lead
well pull mcfluke in if we can between
the two of us-well anyhow well see what
he says

  chuck morgan nodded and turned his
horse aside toward the draw

  ten minutes later the water of the lazy
river was sluicing the dust from the legs
and belly of racey dawsons horse racey
spurred up the bank and rode toward the
long low building that was mcflukes store
and saloon

there were no ponies standing at
the hitching-rail in front of the place
for this racey was devoutly thank-
ful if he could only catch mcfluke by
himself

  as racey dismounted at the rail a man
came to the open doorway of the house and
looked at him he was a heavy-set man
developed like a bloodhound and his hard
blue eyes were close-coupled the reptilian
forehead did not signify a superior mentality
even as the slack retreating chin denoted a
minimum of courage it was a most con-
tradictory face the features did not bal-
ance racey rdawson was not a student of
physiognomy but he recognized a weak chin
when he saw it if this man were indeed
mcfluke then he racey dawson was in
luck

  without a word the man turned from
the doorway racey heard him walking
across the floor and for so heavy a man
his step was amazingly light racey went
into the house the room he entered was
the heart of the range



a large one in front of a side wall tiered to
the low ceiling with shelves bearing a sorry
assortment of ranch-supplies was the store
counter across the back of the room ran
the long bar behind the bar flanking the
door giving into another room were two
shelves heavily stocked with rows of bottles

  the man who had come to the door was
behind the bar his hands were resting on
top of it and he was staring fixedly and
fishily at racey dawson there was no
welcome in his face nor was there any
unfriendliness it was simply exceedingly
expressionless

  racey draped himself against the bar

  liquor said he

  having absorbed a short one he poured
himself a second

  have one with me he nodded to the
man

  all right the mans tone was as

expressionless as his face heres -

he filled and drank

  racey looked about the room

  wheres old man dale he asked
casually

  he got away on me replied the man
he-say-with sudden suspicion-who
are you

  are you mcfluke shot back racey

  the man nodded slowly suspicion con-
tinuing to brighten his hard blue eyes

  then what didja let him get away for
persisted racey luke tweezy said he
left him here an he said hed stay here
that was yore job-to see he stayed here

  who are- persisted the suspicious mc-
fluke

  ner mine who i am rapped out racey
who believed he had formed a correct esti-
mate of mcfluke im somebody who
knows more about this deal than you do
an thats enough for you to know why
didnt you hold old man dale

  i-he got away on me knuckled down
mcfluke i was in the kitchen getting
me some coffee an when i come back he
had dragged it

  luke tweezy will be tickled to death
with you said racey dawson what
do you spose he went to all that trouble
for

  i couldnt help it could i i aint got
eyes in the back of my head sos i can see
round corners an through doors howd
i know old man dale was gonna slide off
when i left him he was all so happy with

his bottle youd a thought hed took root
for life anyway peaches austin oughta
come before the old man left he was sup-
posed to come an he didnt if anythin
slips up account o this its gotta be blamed
on peaches

  yeah i guess so an peaches aint
been here yet

  not yet an i wish to-he was never

cornin

  the mans tone was so earnest that racey
looked at him startled

  why not he asked coldly

  because i dont wanna get my head
blowed off thats why

  aw maybe it wont come to that may-
be luke will win out

  it aint only luke tweezy whos gotta
win out an you know it an theys an
if the size of pikes peak between us an
winnin out i tell yuh i dont like it

its too-dangerous

  shore its dangerous assented racey
slowly revolving his glass between his thumb
and fingers and wondering how far he dared
go with this mcfluke person but a gents
gotta live

  he dont have to get himself killed doin
it snarled mcfluke swabbing down the
bar whos that a-comin

  he went to the doorway to see for him-
self who it was that rode so briskly on the
marysville trail

  peaches austin he sneered hes
only about three hours late

  it was now or never racey risked all
on a single cast

  what did the boss say when him an
lanpher got here an found old dale gone
he asked carelessly

  he raised- replied mcfluke but

lanpher wasnt with him yuh know old
dale hates lanpher like poison well i
told jack like i tell you that if anythin
slips up account o this peaches austin can
take the blame

  racey nodded indifferently and slouched
sidewise so that he could watch the door-
way without dislocating his neck mc-
fluke his back turned still stood in the
doorway racey lowered a cautious hand
and loosened his six-shooter in its holster
he wished that he had taken the precaution
to tie it down it was impossible to foresee
what the next few minutes might bring
forth certainly the coming of peaches
austin was most inopportune


adventure

  peaches austin galloped up he dis-
mounted he tied his horse he greeted
cheerily the glowering mcfluke the latter
did not reply in kind

  this is a fine time for you to get here
he growled a fi-ine time

  shut up you fool cautioned peaches
in a low voice aint you got no better
sense with the old man-

  dont let the old man worry you
yapped mcfluke the old man has done
flitted an jacks been here an hes done
flitted

  whose hoss is that demanded peaches
evidently referring to raceys mount

  one of the boys replied mcfulke
one o jacks friends cmon in

entered then peaches austin a
lithe muscular person with pale eyes
and a face the color of a dead fishs
belly he stared noncommitally at racey
dawson it was evident that peaches aus-
tin was taking no one on trust he nodded
briefly to racey and strode to the bar
mcfluke went behind the bar

  aint i seen you in farewell stranger
peaches austin asked shortly

  you might have returned racey im
mighty careless where i travel

  known jack long peaches was be-
coming nothing if not personal

  long enough smiled racey

  lookit here who are you

  thats whats worryin mcfluke dodg-
ed racey wishing that he could see just
what it was mcfluke was doing with his
hands

  but mcfluke was employing his hands
in nothing more dangerous than the fetch-
ing of a bottle from some recess under and
behind the bar now he laughed

  he aint tellin all he knows he said to
peaches austin dont be so -- sus-
spiciony peaches hes a friend o jacks
i tell yuh he knows all about the deal

  that dont make him no friend of
jacks declared peaches stubbornly
i-

  at which juncture peaches flow of lan-
guage was interrupted by the sudden en-
trance of chuck morgan chuck after a
sweeping glance round the room headed
straight for the bar

  mcfluke said chuck halting a yard
from the bar did you sell any red-eye to
old man dale today

  whats that to you demanded mc-
fluke truculently

  why this replied chuck producing
a six-shooter so swiftly that mcfluke
blinked you listen to me he resumed
harshly it dont matter whether you sold
it to him or not he got it here an thats
the main thing im telling you if he gets
any more im gonna make you hard to find
is that a threat or a promise inquired
mcfluke

  dont do that racey said suddenly
as his hand shot out and pinned fast the
right wrist of peaches austin cmon out-
side now where we can talk right through
the door to yore left aw right mow they
cant hear us lookit they aint no call for
a gun-play none whatever this gent is
only layin down the law to mac an here
you gotta get serious right away see how
easy mac takes it he aint doin a thing
not a thing good as gold mac is cant
you see how a killin thisaway an a fellah
like morgan too would maybe put a crimp
in this place for good have some sense
man we need mcflukes

  he hadnt oughta drawed on mac said
peaches his pale eyes shifty as a cats
darting incessantly between racey and the
doorway

well in the mean time ill see jack an

  peaches austin looked this way and that
before replying

  i shore dont like to tell how it hap-
pened he said sounds so babyish-like
but my hat blowed off over this side of
injun ridge a ways an when i leaned down
to pick it up my hoss started my hand
slipped an i went off on my head ker-blam
an do yuh know ill bet i was three hours

a-runnin from - to breakfast before i

caught that hoss where he was feedin in a
narrow draw im all tired out yet they
aint no strength in my legs

  ill fix it up with jack racey lied with
a wonderfully straight face dont you
worry

  i aint worryin peaches denied irrita-
bly i aint afraid of jack i tell yuh
shore soothed racey who having
formed an estimate of peaches ranked him
scarcely higher than mcfluke and treated
him accordingly shore i know you aint
but alia same you need considerable of a
coolin off yoreself just you stay out here
now an watch me get morgan away
racey nodded blithely to peaches austin
and turned to go into the house he saw
that chuck morgan had come outside that
he had brought mcfluke with him and was
observing events with a cold and calculating
eye

  i tell yuh i couldnt help his gettin the
whisky mcfluke was whining it aint
my fault if somebody gives it to him is it
of course not chimed in racey briskly
mac means all right he didnt know
there was any law against providin old
dale with whisky

  they is a law insisted chuck morgan
belligerently his gun trained unswervingly
on mcflukes broad stomach they is a
law i made it an it goes peaches
he added raising his voice dont you slide
round the house now if you move so much
as a yard from where yore standin i
ventilate mcfluke immediate

  i wouldnt do that said racey mildly
i got my eye on you too declared
chuck what i said to peaches goes for
you an dont forget it

  i aint likely to not me  want you

to do is go someers else peaceful you
aint figurin on livin here are yuh

  chuck uttered a short hard laugh mc-
flukes back was toward racey peaches
austin was behind him thirty feet away
raceys left eyelid drooped his head
moved almost imperceptibly toward his
horse

im goin now said chuck
ill go with yuh just to see yuh
on yore way sort of said racey

  you was goin with me anyway sort of
chuck told him yore the only man
round here so fars i can see an i aint
takin any chances on you not a chance
yore goin down the trail a spell with me
later you can come back keep yore
hands where they are

  quickly chuck shoved mcfluke to one
side rushed forward and possessed himself
of raceys gun crawl yore hoss he com-
manded

  racey obeyed without a word chuck
climbed into his own saddle without losing
the magic of the drop and without losing
sight for an instant of mcfluke and peaches
austin

  take the trail south said chuck mor-
gan and backed his horse in a wide half-
circle

  racey did as he was ordered three
minutes later he was joined by his friend
until the trail took them down into a draw
grown up in spruce chucks gun remained
very much in evidence any unbiased spec-
tator without a knowledge of the facts
would have said that he was keeping a close
watch on racey dawson

  once out of sight of the house of mcfluke
chuck sheathed his six-shooter with a jerk
and returned raceys gun

  you done fine at the last racey said
admiringly as he holstered his weapon
but what did yuh jump mcfluke for that-
away at first that come almighty near
kickin the kettle over that play did

  i know said chuck shamefacedly an
when i rode up to the shack i hadnt in-
tended nothin like that but when i saw
that slickery juniper mcfluke standin
there behind the bar so fat an sassy it come
over me all of a sudden what hed done to
the dale family by lettin old dale have

whisky that i couldnt help myself -

i wanted to knock him down an tromp his
face as flat as a floor it aint as if mcfluke

der them sacks its a wonder you didnt

placidly constructing a cigaret too big
besides all the buttons was off an if theys
anythin i despise its a undershirt without
any buttons sort of wanderin off the
main trail though aint we racey we

zona

an take a good long pull of cold water
youll feel better in the mornin

  soll i feel better in the mornin if you
jiggers will close yore traps an lemme

room on the main street side

  as i live said racey in a tone of vast
surprize theres somebody in the next
room

  sounds like the owner of the starlight
hazarded swing tunstall

  it is the owner of the starlight corrob-
orated the voice an i wanna sleep an i
wanna sleep now

  we aint got no objections racey told
him shes a fine free country an
every gent is entitled to life liberty an the
pursuit of happiness three things no home
should be without

  shut up will yuh squalled the goaded
proprietor of the starlight saloon if you
wanna make a speech go out to the corral

twiddled his bare toes delightedly gent-
mansays you gotta shut up says hes reg-
ular folks too you be good boy now an go
by-by

  shut up

  here here swing cried racey struck
by a brilliant idea what yuh doin with
that gun

  i- began the bewildered swing who
had not even thought of his gun but was
peacefully sitting on his cot pulling off his
boots

  leave it alone racey interrupted in a
hearty bawl dont yuh go holdin it at
the wall even in fun it might go off yuh
cant tell yore so all-fired careless with a
six-shooter swing like enough yore
aimin right where the fellers bed is too
he added craftily

  ensued then sounds of rapid departure
from the bed next door a door flew open

and slammed one padded down the
stairs in his socks invoking his maker as he
went

  an thats the last of him chuckled
racey

  oh you neednt think im forgettin
grumbled swing tunstall sliding out of his
trousers and folding them tidily beside his
boots you soft-headed yap have you
gotta let a woman spoil everythin

  spoil everythin

  you dont think im goin alia way to
arizona by myself nobody to talk to nor
nothin do yuh well i aint you can
stick a pin in that

  racey immediately sprang up seized his
friends limp hand and pumped it vigorously

  bless you for them words he said i
knowed youd stick by me i knowed i
could depend on ol swing to do the right
thing tomorrow you an me will traipse
out an locate us a couple of jobs

  swing doubled a leg flattened one bare
foot against raceys chest straightened the
leg and deposited racey upon his own
proper cot with force and precision

  dont you come honey-fuglin round
me warned swing an i didnt say
nothin about stickin by you neither an
when it comes to the right thing you an me

dont think alike a-tall i-

  i wish youd pull yore kicks a few in-
terrupted racey rubbing his chest you
like to busted a rib

  not the way you landed countered the
unfeeling swing yore tryin to get off
the trail again here you an me plan her

all out to go to-

  you bet burst in racey enthusiasti-
cally we planned to go to either the
bar s or the cross-in-a-box an get that job
shore we did you got a memory like all
outdoors swing it plumb amazes me how
clear an straight you keep everythin in
that head of yores yep it shore does
hereupon in the most unconcerned man-
ner racey dawson began to blow smoke-
rings toward the ceiling

  swing tunstall sank sulkily down upon an
elbow whatsa use said swing tun-
stll whatsa use

  it was then that some one knocked upon
their chamber door

  come in said racey dawson

  the door opened and lanphers comrade
of the attractive smile and the ruthless pro-
file walked into the room he closed the


adventure

door without noise spread his legs and
looked upon the two friends silently

  i heard you talkin through the wall he
said in a studied low tone a tone that
heard through a partition would have been
but an indistinguishable murmur

  hearin us talk through walls seems to
be a habit in this hotel commented racey
tactfully following the others lead in low-
ness of tone

  i couldnt help hearin apologized the
stranger who was vestless and bootless
evidently he had been on the point of re-
tiring when the spirit moved him to visit his
fellow guests id like to talk to yuh

  yore welcome said racey hospitably
yanking his trousers from the only chair the
room possessed si down

  the stranger sat raoey dawson sitting
on the bed his knees on a level with his chin
clasped his hands round his bare ankles and
accorded the stranger his closest attention
to the casual observer however racey
looked uncommonly dull and sleepy even
stupid but not too stupid racey pos-
sessed too much native finesse to overdo it

it was apparent that the stranger
did not recognize him which was
not surprizing for at the dale
ranch racey had been wearing all his
clothes and a beard of weeks now he was
clean-shaven and attired in nothing but a
flannel shirt true the stranger must have
heard him singing to miss dale but a
singing voice is far different from a speaking
voice and racey had not uttered a single
conversational word in the strangers pres-
ence now he had occasion to bless this
happy chance

  swing tunstall slow to take a cue and
still suffering with the sulks continued to he
quietly and smoke his head supported on a
bent arm but he watched the stranger
narrowly

  the stranger tilted back his chair and
levering with his toes teetered to and fro in
silence

  i heard you say you were lookin for a
job in the momin the stranger said sud-
denly to racey

  you heard right nodded racey

  are you dead set on workin for the bar s
or the cross-in-a-box

  i aint dead set on workin for anybody
work aint a habit with either of us but
so long as we got to work the ranches with

good cooks have the call an the bar s an
richies outfit have special good cooks

  the stranger nodded and began to smooth
down hand over hand his tousled hair it
was very thick hair oily and coarse when
sufficiently smoothed it presented that shiny
slick appearance so much admired in the
copper-toed black-walnut era

  not till each and every lock lay in per-
fect adjustment with its neighbor did the
stranger speak

  cooks mean a whole lot was his open-
ing remark a good one can come
mighty nigh holdin a outfit together
money aint to be sneezed at neither
good wages paid on the nail run the cook a
close second how would you boys like to
work for me

  the stranger as he asked the question
fixed racey with his black eyes the
puncher felt as if a steel drill were boring
into his brain but he returned the stare
without appreciable effort racey dawson
was not of those that lower their eyes to any
man

  i take it drawled racey that yore
fixin to iastall all them comforts of home
you was just now talkin about-a good
cook an better wages for the honest workin
man

  naturally i am the strangers eyes
shifted to swing tunstalls face

  yeah-naturally thus racey daw-
son

  the strangers eyes returned quickly to
racey there had been a barely percepti-
ble pause between the two words uttered by
racey dawson pauses signify a great deal
at times this might be one of those times
and it might not the stranger couldnt
be sure from that moment the stranger
watched racey dawson even as the pro-
verbial cat watches the mouse-hole

  racey knew that the stranger was watch-
ing him and he knew why so he smiled
with bland stupidity and nodded a foolish
head

  what wages he inquired

  fifty per was the reply

  where

  southeast of dogville-the rafter h
ranch

  the rafter h huh i thought that
was haleys outfit it was swing tun-
stall speaking

  i expect to buy out haley explained
the stranger smoothly my names
the heart of the range



harpe jack harpe what may i call you
gents    dawson an tunstall eh
i-

  haley aint much better than a nester
interrupted racey he dont own moren
forty cows at one time what you want
with two punchers for a small bunch like
that-an at fifty per

  i know she aint much of a ranch now
admitted jack harpe but everythin has
to have a beginnin im figurin on a right
smart growth for the rafter h within the
next year or two

  figurin on opposition maybe probed
racey dawson

  you never can tell

  you can if you go to cuttin any of bill
barbees corners haleys little bunch
never bothers bill none but a man-size out-
fit so close to the south thataway would
shore give him somethin to think about
then theres the anvil ranch east of the b
bar b theyll begin to scratch theicjieads
you bet hall too maybe although he is a
good ways to the east

  shes all free range said jack harpe
i guess i got as good a right here as the
next gent

  providin you can make the next gent
see yore side of the ease suggested racey

  most folks are willin to listen to reason
stated jack harpe

  i aint so shore doubted racey you
aint looked at the whole of the layout yet
how about the  ranch

  the  repeated jack harpe in a tone
of surprize whatll i have to do with the
 id like to know

i dunno said racey his eyes more
stupid than ever i was just a-wonderin
jack harpe laughed without a sound it
seemed to be a habit of his to laugh silently

  you musta seen me with lanpher i
guess well lanpher an i are just friends
thassall my cattle wont graze far enough
south to overlap on the  anywheres
nor the bar s suggested racey

  nor the bar s

  thats sensible thus racey watch-
ing closely jack harpe from under lowered
lids

  did his last remark strike a glint from
the other mans eyes he thought it did
certainly jack harpes eyes had narrowed
suddenly and slightly

 yeah jack harpe said i aint
countin on doin no fussin with either the
 or the bar s of course bill barbee an
the anvil are different dunno how theyll
take it dunno that i care-much
which is why yore payin fifty per
jak harpe nodded

  yep gotta be prepared for them fel-
lers-bill barbee an the anvil outfit
yore right assented racey dawson
mustnt let em catch yuh nappin you
would look foolish then wouldnt yuh

  he broke off with a sounding laugh and
slapped a silly leg

  how about it gents inquired jack
harpe are you ridin for me or not
you wantin to know right now this
minute

  i dont have to know right now because
i wont be ready for yuh to begin for two or
three weeks but knowin would help my
plans a few i gotta figure things out
ahead

  shore shore let yuh know day after
tomorrow r sooner maybe hows
that

 good enough remember yore wages
start the day yuh say when even if you dont
begin work for a month yet all id ask is
for you to stay round town where i can get
hold of yuh easy gnight

  with this the stranger slid from the chair
opened the door part way and oozed into the
hallway he closed the door without a
sound he regained his own room in equal
silence racey did not hear the shutting of
the others door but he heard the springs of
the cot squeak under jack harpes weight
as he lay down

  swing tunstall framed a remark with his
lips only racey dawson shook his head
the partition was too thin and jack harpes
ears were too long and sharp for him to risk
even the tiniest of whispers with his
hand he made the indian sign for to-
morrow stretched out his long legs
yawned-and fell almost instantly asleep

brown bess vs old kaintuck

by lewis appleton barker

  as late as  when king williams
war commenced england was still
using matchlock muskets in her
armies king william familiar himself
with war on the continent adopted as
the regulation british military arm the
flint musket in  the name brown
bess dates back to  when queen
elizabeth whose soldiery were armed prin-
cipally with long bows and cross-bows had
one regiment equipped with matchlock guns
with browned barrels and fittings which
took their name from their donor but
although matchlocks wheel-locks and snap-
hances in the shape of british army muskets
were known in their day by that name
after  the title was applied only to the
flintlock of that name

  it was easily recognizable from other
muskets of the flint type by these differ-
ences the barrel was fastened to the stock
by pins not bands the arm was mounted
with brass and was marked by the british
government

  the weapon was very unreliable owing
to its total inability to shoot accurately
this was due to the fact that the interior
of the barrel even after boring was far
from true also the bullet itself wabbling
loosely in the barrel and rolling along the
bore as it was discharged rarely went where
it was desired to go

  in addition the soldier was not taught
to exercise any individual shooting he
merely held his gun in a horizontal position
pointed-not sighted-it and fired it was
all volley shooting at not over one hundred
yards

the american flintlock rifle called
kentucky or in dialect kain-
tuck had reached its full develop-
ment about  and was to a great
extent responsible for the gaining of inde-
pendence used by such men as morgan
george rogers clark kenton boone john
sevier and other of the early pioneers the
rifle of that day was nearly as accurate at
short range as the best of modern weapons
it was long slender and graceful and did
not weigh nearly as much as brown bess

  the latter too had the great disad-
vantage of so fouling after being fired five
or six times as to require a half-hours labor
to make it sufficiently clean to be fit to be
again discharged the american beside
rifling or grooving the inside of the barrel
and having the bullet fit the same so that
with adjusted sights the rifle would hit the
bulls-eye at a measured distance had
learned to use a greased patch

  in the stock of the gun was a little box
with a hinged cover in this was kept a lot
of circular pieces of greased linen or leather
of a size and cut with a die after the
powder was poured into the barrel it was held
butt on the ground and one of these patches
was laid on the muzzle the ball was placed
on it and pressed into the bore with the
thumb then it was rammed home

  a blow with the ramrod flattened the
ball a little so that it held its position then
when the rifle was fired the ball expanded
circumferentially and with its cover filled
the grooves preventing the escape of gas
and gaining rotation the patch following
the ball closely as it left the barrel cleaned
away the culch left by the passage of the
lead and having accomplished its office
dropped to the earth the ball speeding on
to its mark the patch also aided and
facilitated loading and made a gas-tight
fit of the missile to the bore

  for the first time in history a weapon
of precision came into use and one
also capable of repeating many times
its first performance and these weapons
were almost entirely used by americans
in the entire british army in america dur-
ing the revolution there was but one com-
pany of riflemen and that made up of
hessians german gamekeepers

  in all the colonial wars the rifles of the
colonists did real service at poor brad-
docks fatal defeat at the monongahela
only about four hundred of the thirteen
hundred english troops escaped nor would
they have but for the rifles of washingtons
backwoodsmen

  at the battle on the plains of abraham
where the gallant wolfe lost his life the
colonial riflemen were placed in front of his
brown bess vs old kaintuck



army well was his trust rewarded down
went the french ranks as if plowed by
cannon marking the close of french power
in the western world but great britain
let the lesson go unheeded while america
kept turning out rifles

  it was not alone american superior
strategy that won that great struggle for
liberty known as the revolution there
were conjoining causes but first among
them was the influence and work of the
american rifleman and to him may be
traced french intervention since he won
the battle of saratoga up to which time
france had turned a deaf ear to our en-
treaties

  in the fighting from  to  en-
glands loss in battle had been five to our
three when the news of concord and
bunker hill spread through the land vir-
ginia and other western riflemen were sent
for a british soldier was shot at  yards
with only half his head in sight ten men
and three officers were killed in one day
reconnoitering a rifleman sighting some
british on a scow half a mile distant finally
potted the entire company

  to say nothing of tim murphys feat
at saratoga known to every american
schoolboy general fraser was directing
the british line as he supposed out of
shooting distance general morgan ordered
murphy to climb a tree and get him
fraser was three hundred yards distant
the first shot cut his bridle-rein the second
killed the man behind him and the third

gave him a mortal wound thus forever
cutting short that gallant officers kope of
retrieving the family estates forfeited by
his father the notorious simon fraser lord
lovat

  and so on until general howe offered
a reward for the capture alive of one of these
ogres and his shooting-gear when howe
finally got him the prisoner was sent to
england to exhibit his marksmanship and
give some idea to the british public of the
difficulties their troops were encountering

  during the years of  and  rifle-
men were sought and organized everywhere
regiment after regiment was formed and
to them may be given the credit for the
success of the southern and last campaign
of the war

  kentucky was rendered habitable by the
same deadly weapon it was the only effec-
tive agent against englands savage allies
george rogers clarke at the head of only
two or three hundred riflemen in -
captured the french-british posts of kas-
kaskia cahokia and vincennes and added
a territory to the new nation of far greater
extent than had been dreamed of

  the influence of the american rifle can
not be overestimated and while brown bess
has added to the possessions of the british
empire and will ever find a soft spot in
mens hearts as the upholder of british liber-
ties yet we must yield the palm in every way
to the greatest single factor in our struggle
for freedom the early bulwark of american
independence old kaintuck

author of el capitii arrnie not for a thousand

to those who go down to the sea
in dreams a water-front is a sum-
mer-sweet spot of wriggling shiny
shingle fashioned like a gorgeous
horse-collar quite as brilliantly varnished
quite as oerlapped with a flowing main if
the spelling be not too closely scrutinized
adjacent sand-hills billowing higher and
higher toward green hills-or perhaps blue-
are careless burial-ground for eloquent memo-
rials of the sea here a quaint dilapidated
dory rotting in the spicy breeze carrying
from those picturesque hillocks a faint aroma
of sea-pinks a rusted broad-fluked anchor
thrusting upward indomitable strength in-
controvertible poesy

  among those retired and modest green
hills-or perhaps blue-nestles a village like
no other village in the world the product of
endless cycles of self-sufficiency mild-man-
nered in architecture and speech white-
washed garden-fringed full of a flavor of
philosophy a hint of the south sea-a
ship-load of romance borne back by hardy
whalers-graces every cottage interior in
the shapes of huge shells intricately pat-
terned corals a variety of sponges and other
miscellany

  a white-brick light-house stands upon the
farthest point of land down its storm-
beaten side a great seam goes-like a petri-
fied lightning-flash it possesses an odor of
mustiness utterly dissimilar to that of other
land structures indeed it is not of the

land it is of the sea the lacy-sparred
ships riding in the cove know this and seem
to nod to it from the restless bosom of the
surf that is the voice men listen to beyond
all other sounds the frame for this picture
is a wondrous gilding of sunlight and the
wall upon which it hangs has been papered
by providence a deep benign blue

  to those who go down to the sea in ships
a water-front presents little of this glamour
sight smell sound-they are all of a dif-
ferent order poesy has been abandoned
for practicability the billowing sands are
hidden by dingy warehouses the shiny
shingle by wharves the green hills-or per-
haps blue-by such a growth of stone and
mortar that they have become pressed down
to a common flatness while the village lost
to its maidenly coyness shows itself a bulg-
ing strapping thing of rank maturity un-
shapely smut-frocked big-featured-a great
city

  the odors most prevalent suggest a reek-
ing caldron of strange dumpings-tar and
stale brews and too long-trusted fish and
thick grease and wet clothing with sweating
men inside them and animals and harness
and iron in the matter of sound the voice
of the sea has been quite outdone and is no
longer heard instead there comes a cough-
ing and a sputter of mechanical lungs a
clang and jangle of dropping or clashing
metal a rattle of steel-rimmed wheels a
discordance of hoarse human bawling often

vile-tongued snorts and clatter and the
groaning of timbers

  the light-house speaking the uncharted
seas-one sees nothing of it there are no
uncharted seas although ships and men still
lose themselves in blind alleys of tossing
waters and the frame for this picture is of
no settled hue at all but dim and smudged
and finger-marked by tentacles of smoke-
just like the wall behind it

  much of all this was summed up on the
water-front of san francisco for arnie sond-
heim to walk through on his errand from
ship office to ship office but he had been
too long of it to notice too long inured to
these and grimmer sights to these and more
deadly smells to these and harsher sounds
to wonder about them

  fog stole in from the sea so little seen
and drizzled miserably over everything
sliming the pavements chilling the flesh
saturating garments clouds of it blocks of
it blocks of it walls of it everywhere shut
out the sim and tested human affection for
salt water

  arnie issuing from a doorway stood star-
ing about in mild disgust and proceeded to
affirm once more in strong language and a
soft voice how utterly he detested all water
and especially that with brine in it and
those who ruled the latter kind

  they dont want me huh well i dont
want them either theres places ashore
where a man can live like hes supposed to
live

  his hand hard in the palm as the scales
of a fish went down into his trousers pocket
and came up gripping a bulky roll of yellow
banknotes his features relaxed as he con-
templated it-four thousand dollars un-
questioned in value anywhere in the
world

  the little man at his elbow-he stood no
taller than amies armpit-put a cheerful
face upon the matter he had remained at
amies elbow throughout they had
brought in the sinking snowbird together
they had received their due of salvage to-
gether the little man hoped they would take
out a tight bark together arnie in the cabin
as he should be and he in the galley-quite
as he should be too he preferred down in
his heart that it be a whaler for whaling was
a mans job just as cooking for whaling men
was a mans job beyond all else in life arnie
would make a wondrous whaling skipper he
knew whether he had ever whaled before or

not-which represented the highest tribute
one could pay

  it amazed him thoroughly that arnie was
not snapped up at once by every owner and
agent nevertheless he put a cheerful face
upon the situation because he knew no other
face to put upon it and because he read his
bible and once in a while swore a little to
prove that god watched over men and spar-
rows even when arnie said he was through
with the sea yankee cheerfulness was in no
wise impaired they were sailing men to-
gether they would always be sailing men
together it was a noble career

  doos beat all he said how mighty
sot-up a landlubberll git caint see ez any
on em cud box a compass theyself nary a
thing yuh couldnt do to a ship jes chills
play to yuh i sense it pride made the
little cook beam

  arnie shook his head and attempted no
reply he recognized as the cook did not
just what stood between him and a masters
berth notwithstanding that every owner
murmured something anent qualifications
it was not the lack of qualifications that en-
tered the matter it was drink drink meant
unsteadiness

  arnie scorned to tell them that in two
months not a drop of liquor had he
taken just as they scorned to come out
openly and tell him why they did not want
him he had a reputation the considera-
tion ended there the misfortune lay in the
fact that given any sort of basis for pride
and development the distasteful whisky
substitute with its momentary exaltation
its fool witchery would never have entered
into consideration

  ill try one more japes he relented

stuffing the money away but by-i

wont ship before the mast come on but-
ton up man your vests wet

  gorry ejaculated the cook and
wrapped his skimpy jacket tight about his
skimpy chest enclosing his beloved flowered
waistcoat in a jealous embrace

  they made in out of the dreary weather
and stood before a railing behind which a
pair of hard eyes gaged them all the while
that arnie talked

  heres four thousand dollars to buy in on
any vessel youve got arnie told him
and myself to sign as master of er-coast-
wise trading

  near by at the same railing a swarthy-
faced individual looked up prosperity
io

  adventure



exuded from him likewise an air of being an
ardent hunter after more

  an half-again on my account sir
spoke up japes

  with true yankee shrewdness he added
we be a mind tuh take a chance how-be
shippins downright poor fer a spell set me
down at cook sir an all agreeable

  hml remarked the man behind the
hard pair of eyes a good deal of money-
out of a job is it pearl-fishing

  deep sea more like was arnies wry an-
swer name arnie sondheim

  brumg in the snowbird abandoned at
sea the cook announced

  oh yes-yes you have a masters cer-
tificate mr sondheim

say the word and ill go get examined
despite him an eagerness crept into his
voice he scarcely knew what it was first
and last he wanted no more of the sea yet
here he was growing excited

  no question of passing be sure of
that

  his anticipation pulling him on he con-
tinued south american ports-valpa-
raiso callao san carlos--

  of course san carlos was the end and aim
of it all he admitted to himself it was to
reach lelona and to reach her in the right
status-a captain as she had desired him
to be-that he bent his pride to these land-
cruising men in office buildings and men-
tioned the four thousand dollars by right
they should be glad to take him for himself
and no questions asked

  the man behind the hard eyes was say-
ing

  i couldnt promise anything at this time
the big vessels hog the trade weve had to

lay up two wind-boats-

  arnie left the cook replying to this japes
was a yankee and took no insult silently
as for arnie-what did he care for the mans
opinion it was simply a question of know-
ing an end of all this drifting and that
meant lelona the chilean maid and that
meant being a ships master for she would
not take him otherwise the sixth well-
found successful man of ship affairs had
turned him down-and arnie smiled at the
thought that he knew more about the busi-
ness than the man

  well he would head for jakes place and
down some of the hot bitter stuff that made
him as favored and fine a man as any
there were ways of getting to heaven be-

sides loosing a skysail boom that has got
jammed the jangling music-kox soon be-
came a harp a poor enough heaven he
called it to sit and strum a harp arnie
sondheim took his keenest joy in genuine
activity activity such as must have killd
many another man or at least have pro-
duced heart-leakage rupture tuberculosis
but what heaven kept a man forever yearn-
ing for that which he could not understand-
just as a pregnant woman yearns for an arti-
cle of diet she has never tasted and if one
must enter this heaven through the portals
of raw liquor-why then one must

       out in the corridor he halted wait-
ing for japes and there a hand fell
upon his shoulder he squared
about the swarthy-faced man of prosper-
ity stood nodding to him dressed in the
height of fashion a huge diamond winking
from his necktie

  well mr sondheim well im pleased to
know you my names zeesman-gabriel
zeesman happened in on culp very nicely
very nicely for you mr sondheim culps
not your kind too conservative not the
way with me when i see a good man i
dont ask what his last job was face-value
-thats the coin my friend

  arnie grinned in return mumbled some-
thing and waited the man possessed a
radiant personality and spoke to him out of
a great void in the tone of equality

  fact is he declared im a ship-owner
myself-in a small way you appeal to me
my friend theres a brig of mine anchored
in the bay ready to clear and no captain to
take her out these high-priced masters
are too much for me to be frank my funds
are limited fitting her out and provision-
ing her has drained me

  its no time for making fortunes on the
trade arnie agreed sympathetically im
willing to help out

  he pulled out the big roll of bills a boy-
ish exuberance flamed swiftly money
meant nothing to him

  if its valparaiso-san carlos im your
man the vision of lelona grew strong

if shes ready now-

  slowly sondheim slowly i how about
your papers

  they could examine me right off sug-
gested this enigmatical sailor who was so
tired of the sea wages wouldnt hinder
any profits are small i know
southward



  as to that its all a question of manage-
ment zeesman beamed leave that to
me-not a bad boat as boats go-a two-
sticker-much better than she looks stanch
life-boats and the right time of the year-

  amie could not be sure whether it was
zeesman himself that winked or the dia-
mond he did not care

  japes came out then he wore a rather
red face from the exertion of regaling culp
with a true example of yankee indepen-
dence the situation was explained for his
benefit he exhibited no such eagerness as
had arnie but he had the natural seamans
ease of adaptation wherever arnie went
he went only in his case his money stayed
with him-or rather in the bank where he
had put it

  they sallied out to zeesmans office a far
from agreeable place on a far from agreeable
street the air of the room was out of keep-
ing with zeesman there an arrangement
was made-tentatively thence arnie and
japes struck out for the examiners and
after that for a booksellers-just to be on
the safe side the examination was sched-
uled for the next day

  amie bought three books on the subject
of navigation and by the following morning
had entirely digested them even to the
punctuation marks which to one who has
had no schooling past the fifth grade be-
came the part of discretion precious little
the volumes did for him he had not ob-
served ship-handling for seventeen years to
no avail-and he knew his huntley back-
ward

  the examiners grumblingly undertook to
set down this mild blue-eyed fellow gave
him one after another the full category
scowled over his penmanship stared hard
at the astounding accuracy of his answers
gloomed at his unfamiliar but precise han-
dling of sextant and chronometer-and found
nothing to disqualify him

  it was usual for applicants appearing be-
fore them to be nervous and bothered and
so unduly prone to error and confusion
arnie showed no nervousness at all-where-
by one might read his unassailable confi-
dence in himself which was not strictly self-
confidence at all but a queer underrating of
all human knowledge neither he nor any-
body else had acquired sufficient learning to
be worth recounting was his view of things
hence that endless yearning that he knew no
means of satisfying

 he was an idealist and yet he knew no
ideal by which to guide himself hence tke
habit-when the yeanung was strong within
him-to drink burning liquor that somehow
lifted him off the low plane of mortal intelli-
gence he was abnormal but he did not
know it and his abnormality resulted only
in making him appear a very low type of
animal indeed

  the examiners made nothing of him aad
gave him a masters certificate because they
could do nothing else then and there they
determined to revise standards

   outside he was met by japes who asked
nothing about the examination remarked
it was a fair morning and he had been down
having a look at the jessica

   a weazly bottom she is an none o the
likes o your sort whereto in a tone of em-
phasis he added sir

   his magpie eyes sparkled at this thought
but since arnie appeared to take no notice
he grew owlishly earnest again

   i had the smell of er-from the water
yuh mind-an shes-shes a wee mite over-
ripe

   well wash er down and give er a coat
arnie told him shell get us to san car-
los to the yellow and green buoy wed be
seen there from the hotel

   immediately he was lost in quite another
picture than that of a ship

   japes blinked professionally shaken by
this speech

   but theres the bringin of er back an
the printin of er in the papers an yer name
ez master-sos a better vessel  be wishful
of a skipper

   aye the bringing of er back and her
name-thatd be sondheim mused arnie
thatd be sondheim but you never cast
eyes on er japes-no

   wasnt i jes glimpsin er puzzled

japes sondheim ye mought name-

  come along its a busy day thus
did amie cut him off

  and truly it was a busy day notwith-
standing that the ship was already loaded
and the hatches battened down as japes
jabbering informed him and the bill of
goods signed zeesman had even made some
start at collecting a crew with the help of
the mate-an unclassifiable person with a
huge buckled nose swung a point or more to
larboard a wide bony frame on which his
sour-scented clothes hung straight and flap-
ping a pair of blear eyes and a voice that
no

adventure

sang wearily through his nose whose curves
encouraged a startling variety of sounds
the mates name was rose

  i gadder some more men an be wid you
quick he assured arnie a cook you got
odders iss easy you got luck mr zees-
man wherewith he departed

  arnie had scant time to consider what
companionship he was acquiring so briskly
did zeesman take him in hand and confront
him with papers galore papers in regard to
the jessicas clearance papers establishing
arnies proprietary interest in the vessel
papers-papers-papers and as yet he
had not so much as seen the ship

  but to the shrewd yankee cooks dismay
arnie treated all this as essential inconse-
quence to be got over as expeditiously as
possible he was embarking for san carlos
as captain and had it been necessary and
feasible he would have sailed a plank as
readily as a liner just so his arrival as master
of it before the white-walled san carlos
hotel was regularly attested

  zeesman appeared in fine humor and sev-
eral times clapped arnie on the back

   i can tell a man first off he kept insist-
ing youre the one for the job sondheim
ive put all i have in this voyage our in-
terests are linked-and well covered a
pretty sum i paid the underwriters every
cent of our money absolutely protected

  he rubbed his hands and now arnie ob-
served for certain that not the huge diamond
alone but one of zeesmans coal-black orbs
winked solemnly

  im obliged to you sir for the chance
arnie replied frankly out went his cupped
seamans hand ill bring er in if i have to
tow er myself

  zeesman quickly intruded

  yourself-yes yourself-but nobody
else his tone became that of complaint
we cant afford to pay salvage remember
that do what you can-within reason
we cant fight every misfortune the in-
surance is-

  but arnie understood little of the subject
of insurance honesty looked out of his
blue eyes as he said

  it wont come to that you can trust
me

  oh i trust you i trust you once
again that eye of zeesmans winked the
men first sondheim-and yourself im a
humane man the ship is secondary

  all the way to the wharf and over the

gently rumpled waters of the bay japes
meditated in profound silence over this con-
versation but he said nothing to arnie
and arnie sat in the stemsheets of the little
gig and grinned at the sunny world even
when the jessica came fairly into view from
behind a huge steam vessel the shrunken
size of her the pitiable elderliness of her
the lack of paint the dejection of deck-
houses and spars-these and other mute
signs failed utterly to bother him he was
captain-captain sondheim-el capitdn
arrrnie

  the purring of that name in the castilian
softness of lelonas tongue made music in
his ears music of the spheres such as no
music-box could ever produce life meant
something there was no room any more for
loneliness for dismal survey of the aim of
existence japes saw the rich flush on his
face and was the gay-hearted lord of the
galley once more he broke forth into song

now tail on ye whalers ye hard-fightin sailors

  an well sing us a chantey of jo-nah-

  arrived at the jessicas side he was up
the main chains in a jiffy and into the grimy
box of a galley where his beloved vest
wrapped in paper and tucked out of harms
way the dust began to fly and the sweat to
roll as he roared in all the might of his thin
chest the song of the bering sea fishers

  by the time he had brought his domain to
order and come forth to draw some water
arnie had taken full stock of his new com-
mand save for that deeply-stowed portion
below hatches had set those of the crew
that had come aboard to slushing and house-
cleaning and having unfolded and perused
the long list of the cargo-which thereafter
he would never forget in any detail-was
engaged in the most meticulous inspection
of the ships stores of the extra canvas and
spars in the loft of testing and sorting and
waiting for the mate to bring the rest of the
crew

  japes watched him go by and marveled
at the troubled air he wore it was an un-
common thing for arnie to be troubled it
was the assumption of absolute responsibil-
ity the little cook thought and thereupon
that shrill voice bawled right sturdily the
optimistic twenty-second stanza of jonah
so that arnie might hear

  but responsibility alone could not have
troubled arnie rather it woulj have lifted
him clear-browed into a mood of unshackled
southward

hi

ease no it was simply that the jessica
lacked her complement of many sorts car-
ried sails that were thin and rotted must em-
ploy ropes bewhiskered by time had sadly
warped decks and bitts budding out of them
that shook loosely when one kicked them-
these and other matters

  he felt himself already facing difficulties
that zeesman should know about and yet
zeesman had said there was no more money
his explanation that amies four thousand
dollars had gone into insurance and provis-
ions and advances to the crew and an end-
less catalog of other things was quite un-
derstandable

  rose came aboard bringing four more
hands of four sizes and colors and degrees of
ignorance he had a large way had rose
and he laughed as if he were sneezing when
arnie called to his attention one need after
another

  never you should fear sir the mate
said come a heavy vind ve clew up an
get pushed free of charge dey hold dey
hold good dose boats-sure dey is fine
boats look see em how you like dat
now so good-sure

  arnie watched him with a hint of his old
forecastle indifference at the intimation of
this speech he thought it nothing less than
funny when this crude fellow suggested that
he was afraid for himself he laughed sud-
denly-and he was the old arnie that officers
found so difficult to comprehend he
showed the lists

  id ought to have a look at the hold
open up the hatches

  at this rose began to use his hands to
emphasize his objection the hatches were
battened down-it was a tough job-as
mate he had done his work well

  it ended in amies call for jib and top-
sails to be shaken out and the anchor catted
the response of the little vessel pleased him
in short order they were in movement and
on the full swell of the mighty pacific such
a summer breeze rufiled them along as
might cool the brow of one who goes down
to the sea in dreams the course was set
the quartet of the starboard watch sent be-
low and the jessica slipped through a spark-
ling atmosphere on her way south talking
to herself merrily her smeary sails scorn-
fully repudiating their age japes sweltering
quite naturally again in his savory steam
and howling the anthem of the huskies in
mammoth content

southward-southward-arnie
paced beside the windward rail
and breathed the satisfaction of it
all deep into his lungs they called him
capn they answered him aye sir
and so she be sir as a sweet undertone
in a majestic oratorio these sounds reached
him

  southward-that was the theme of the
piece he felt an intense desire to stand all
day at the taffrail and cast the log in a
while the broad strip of land had entirely
erased itself in its place no angry clouds
gathered the barometer held steady the
waves slapped the vessels side open-
palmed as a horseman slaps the flank of
his mount southward-

  how wonderful a sensation anticipation
was days of figuring out just what would
happen how he should land where lelona
would be-days of getting familiar with his
new position growing into it contrasting it
with the hard days that had gone by
seventeen years and more with nothing to
show for them-and a voice that whispered
how different it might be and here he wasl
whisky-bah-the music-box in jakes
place-music-

  the mate recalled him to a practical out-
look by singing out eight bells the jes-
sica had no ships bell the helmsman monot-
onously chanted the half-hours and the
mate roared them after him this termina-
tion of the watch he roared with especial
vehemence straight at arnie therefore
arnie not wishing to interfere with roses
four hours of authority on deck took the
hint and went below

  he spent some time getting his bit of a
cabin into shape so dirty and vile it was
arnie had smelt smells of every wretched
kind most of his life he thought this one by
a slight margin the worst but what was a
smell what was a bad dream it was just
a dream he was in the midst of reality
now

  at the foot of the companionwav near
the table he saw as he came out a card-
board box of fair size it had not been there
when he inspected the ship before conse-
quently he unknotted the strings and
turned up a flap the thing contained bot-
tles short and thick amber-hued ruby
tawny with the liquor in them a few almost
black and all plainly marked the mate
had brought them then when he brought
the last of the crew a considerable outlay


 adventure

he adjudged and more than one man could
conveniently down between san francisco
and san carlos he spoke of it to the mate
later

 mr zeesmans good vishes rose
bobbed again that sneezing sound mr
zeesman hear you like dat to drink veil-
he do right he good man sure

  amie said mildly

 somebody told him a - lie well

dole it out in tots to the crew-with water
he gave the mate no chance to reply he
had been reflecting over something else

  kind of queer rose the jessica clearing
for san carlos san carlos i says to zees-
man  i dont remember his saying any-
thing to that but san carlos was the port
on the paper i never saw much shipping
there either

  the mate hastened to assure him that
this was no coincidence he said

  all dem ports iss de same down dere
want de same tings-all of em

  amie nodded disinclined toward argu-
ment it was of no matter aayway what
did strike him as peculiar was coming on
deck that night to find the mate working
over the forecastle hatch cover to get it in
place again and hammering away at the
battens for all he was worth arnie went
forward and asked what it meant

  veil sir- bang bang bang and the
hatch nearly sea-tight again-veil sir-i
vouldnt have voke you only when i go

lookin fer de soundin lead-

  a stupid-faced grinning masthand heard
him and pointed and said

  shes a-hangin on the mast sir tuh dry

i never hear of a soundin-lead as was-

  douse my lights im a unfortunate
man wailed the mate there now

  at once amie began to have doubts as to
the man zeesman had given him for mate
odd enough he had seemed at the first and
now-searching in the hold for the lead a
poor ship with a poor mate no getting
ones satisfactions lightly

  but these doubts rested easily while the
weather continued fair and the wind strong
and steady off the quarter nine knots he
reckoned the hourly speed and even ten
old sails groaning stays strained audibly
but forgot none of their early pride

 two days-three-four-and the most
select conditions a sailor man knows a
gently running sea an even wind in which
the braces were hardly ever touched a

speckled sky and not too harsh a sun be-
sides rose to all appearance understood his
business could chart the course and hold it
and kept the vessel tidy and trim arnie
lived through the hours as he had been wont
to five through the moments when the
whisky had him-with an almost foolish
smile on his face for no such thing as this
could last he would soon be waking up in
grim earnest

  japes joyed in the return to his killing
duties also in the increasing tropical heat
he sweated and bellowed sea-songs with
equal lustiness-until the fourth day the
watches in turn and all of a group in the dog-
watches gathered before the bit of a galley
to observe him and to hear him cutting off
the due of air grinning delightedly as at the
finest show they had ever been permitted to
witness-until the fourth day the very
ship sang too in all her parts for sheer glad-
ness of the adventure-until the fourth day

on the fourth day at noon while
amie aimed his sextant to make
eight bells a tiny film of smoke came
out of a seam in the deck curled upward and
was gone

 amie blinked his eyes and addressed him-
self to his reading close beside the main
hatch another bluish haze showed itself
the wind destroyed it

  eight bells arnie roared lowered the
instrument and rubbed his eyes then with
all his might he stared at the boards
frowned shaded his gaze started suddenly
as the phenomenon was repeated and went
and brought the mate

  funny ting muttered rose once i
see de wapor look like dat

  despite the mans obvious effort to appear
unmoved into the skin of his face crept a
pastiness

  the crew were beginning to gape amie
sprang into action

  rip off the hatch cover he bawled
but roses steel grip clutched him

  dont do dat he jabbered seal im
up keep de air out

  arnie hesitated and made his mistake
the mates advice seemed sound he called
for tarpaulins extra sails and had them
spread everywhere over the decks with
that all trace of the haze disappeared sen-
tiently eager prattling joyously the jessica

ran on southward-southward-

  the next morning the edges of the laid
southward



canvas gave off a gray-blue mist arnie
watched it as in a daze from his counte-
nance vanished the foolish boyish smile in
its place came a hardness a calculation
swiftly without mental scratching he com-
puted his position settled the port of san
francisco nearly a round thousand miles
astern and ordered the hatch uncovered

  when it came off it brought with it a
cloud of dark smoke that rose into the air
and did not thin but fetched after it more
and more and more the crew became artic-
ulate the mate swore in a foreign tongue
japes drew out of the galley banging his
shins and apologizing to himself-and for
the first time went unnoticed

  arnie had ripped off his jacket flung away
his cap he was engaged in tying his hand-
kerchief over his mouth and nose he called
for a rope and thrust the noose under his
arms he mouthed a word to rose and
dropped down into the hold with his going
a vast hush spread over the ship

 minutes he remained below then a
sharp tug came at the rope they pulled
him up a coughing limp-legged figure
when he could find his breath

  the pumps he cried to them hitch
em up water-give it to er

  his streaming eyes stared all about at the
sea at the sky they danced-the sea and
the sky-golden-visaged in a swath of blue
and green they mocked him he dropped
down weakly but his voice possessed spirit
confidence

  shes not in danger-well have it out-
call the watch mr rose four men to the
pumps bend on skysl booms stinsail

booms-

  and as the vessels head yawed hold er
steady

  steady it is sir drifted from the wheel
the watch tumbled out of the scuttle
gaped momentarily and were hustled into
the rigging the pumps began to clank
upon the crew the effect was much the same
as upon children astonishment dismay
clipped the wings of their mentality ques-
tioning was for undisturbed times in this
emergency they did not profess to think
robbed of thought they depended utterly
on the ships master arnie recognized this
knew at once the fulness of his responsibil-
ity nor did it frighten him

  a great calm settled down upon him
robed him in strength he had no nerves
that were not his absolutely to command

the ship was on fire and burning stoutly
these people were in his keeping their lives
their hopes their expectations this ship
was in his keeping zeesmans ship zees-
mans all zeesmans trust and zeesman
had been the one man to reach out a hand
of understanding and friendship there

was himself there was lelona-waiting-

  clink-clank spoke the pumps the hose
squirmed like a serpent rousing from a long
nap-a very long nap indeed salt water
began to spit out of its mouth and run down
into the hatch no sound stole upward
from the belching depths aloft a cry rang
out bits of canvas took the breeze the jes-
sica gained headway and raced the laugh-
ing dancing waves southward-southwardl
bring it up lads bend your backs
shouted arnie give me a hold and ill
show you

  elbow to elbow with them he thrust down
and pulled up the flow increased a hiss-
ing told them how well they did as quickly
as one man let go the handle and reeled
away another sprang to spell him it must
be back-breaking labor arnie gave room
and came to the mate stooping over the
hatch

  oy vould yuh see dat rose howled at
him black-my my its vurse vile i see
it ve couldnt never do it vere doomed
men capn sondheim

  arnie measured him wrathfully his mild
eyes seeing the quick-stealing fear in this
person who next to him held in his hands
the safety of so many the preservation of
so much then men could be frightened
even by smoke

  shut up take your turn at the pumps
he thrust him away sternly

  clink-clank clink-clankl
a new voice of the jessica a grating
wheezing tired voice for four days it had
been a happy piping ardent voice and
serene auriferous peace in the tinseled light
of heaven serene auriferous peace to fool
them while all the time this monster ate at
the jessicas vitals and if one could turn
his eyes stop his nose clog his ears that
same peace surrounded them now

  the sea had not risen the sky had not
darkened the wind had not freshened it
was unbelievable arnie felt ready to doubt
his sense to put this strange happening
down as a mad hallucination such as the sea
sometimes provokes a nightmare of no sub-
stance presently he would wake from it

southward - and lelona waiting there

   all that day the voice of the pumps cried
out men came off to the galley and had the
fuel of life thrust at them by the chirping
spider of a cook who assured them it was a
fine day for the worst business and he
couldnt object they fell to scowling at
him when he talked so from doing that they
fell to cursing him

  sho he remonstrated such a catouse
i never did meet up with a mite o fire-
well now the victuals  be better done
fer it lads- sakes alive thet ere door an
me we dont conjingle

  he rubbed the bruised spot on his cheek
and smiled paternally

  aint we shd know not a sparrow fall-
eth-

  tuh-ith sparruhs he was roughly

interrupted grog i says

   late in the still night arnie lay on his
back on the deck gasping and watching the
stars showering blessings of peace peace
peace he had flung back for a needed rest
from the terror of the pumps save only
 that rasping horrid screech stillness unut-
j terable lay upon the bosom of the deep
then out of that stillness quavered a thin
labored broken sound

  some focsles i know says jonah i low
 stunk wus than the guts o this critter

   but the set o the gaff in this ere bloomin craft
   it dont make my stomick tuh fit er- 

  japes-he knew by this-had surrendered
his sleep to pump with the others and to
what end with every retch of the hose a
stream of salt-water rushed into the bowels
of the vessel where with or without the aid of
the fire the heart of the enterprise the valu-
able cases of cargo must in a short time be
ruined and that meant that zeesman
must be ruined-san carlos lay as far out
of reach now as a dream and this dream

of his that- port lights of- what right

had a fellow like him to be dreaming he
was here to safeguard zeesmans ship and
zeesmans cargo he struggled up aching
-aching with japes toiling and singing

that way-

  he fell to upon the pump-handle having
pushed some one blindly from that sweat-
smeared imstrument of agony it was not
japes for japes grinned cheerfully right
next his cheek and abandoned jonah to
mumble for his private ear

  thet ere mate  bear a sight o
watchin i callate keeps too nigh the

boats-drinks outlandish dunno ez hes
tuh be trusted a-tall

  the mite of a fellow refusing to give up
collapsed in a while and had to be thrust
aside as if he were a sack of meal arnie
pumped through two shifts and then could
stand up no longer and the stars paled
and the day dawned about them

  the jessica had not her true buoyancy
now low she rode in the water all too slug-
gish to act right even in this light sea yet
gorged with brilne though she was the fire
had not been conquered smoke curled out
of her continually the worried grumbling
of the men too demanded some heartening
change therefore arnie ordered a rever-
sal of the activity and a deal of the water
that had been pumped in was pumped out
again	i

  by this time another day had dragged
past the volume of smoke neither more
nor less issued forth every minute rose
trod the deck like a captive beast muttered
to himself and at length came out plainly
for abandonment

  aint she covered hull an cargo he
reasoned is it ve risk our life

 maybe arnie answered him lacon-
ically whereat rose started go batten
down and tar the seams make er air-
tight a light that rose had not yet
learned to know gleamed in arnies eyes
were sailing this vessel south you and

    yy

me

  another night amid such hushed start-
ling beauty as the tropics know-unsavory
incense wafted skyward-eight knots-nine
knots-and the tarred deck-boards grew
warm to the touch the gray-blue haze kept
them gaunt company

 night and morning-noon and night
the weather showed no sign of coming on
foul its uninterrupted peacefulness began
to be uncanny the sunlight danced upon
the skipping waves the easy swell breathed
regularly the parting foam tittered at the
ships bows the slapping counter sounded a
satisfied chuckle

  it was not soothing to the nerves this
frivolous merry-making of a gambling ocean
it was anything but that it got under the
skin and back of the eyes it worked evilly
upon the most hardened and unimaginative
of the ships crew arnie it victimized among
the first he thought the elements laughed
at him knowing better than he what was
going on deep down in the vessels bowels
southward



 he had known the sea to laugh and sing and
 beckon and wait until its patience was re-
 warded

   the days were hot hot the decks were
 hotter he watched the masts fascinated
 expecting confidently that they would sud-
 denly lean over burned through at the butt
 and bury them all in a hissing caldron

   if only he had feared as these others
 feared the mate became a fidgetting autom-
 aton striding forward and aft his feet stick-
 ing to the warm tar and smacking as he
 went it was from him that the crew took
 their cue and let their doubts smolder to
 terror

   for arnie there was but anger at the
 destiny he could not solve impotent hunger
 searching his spiritual vitals with the means
 of satisfying his want growing every day
 more remote the clamorous perfidious
 voice of the rigging soughed in a dulcet tone

   mio arrmie-capitan arrrnie-i loook
 fair you sheep-

   maddened he stared at the smoke and
 when he could no longer stand it thus he
 tore off the forecastle hatch cover bawled
 for a rope and charged this buried enemy
 once again when they had dragged him
 up and doused him with buckets of cold
 water they did not understand the extra-
 ordinary look in his red-ringed eyes
 neither did he understand a trembling had
 seized him he gaped down into that vomit-

	ing hole

   boat-hooks rope and tackle get
 those cases up he astonished them

   they made a wide berth for him begin-
 ning to fear his mind touched they rigged
 a sort of shears nevertheless and grappled
 for a hold the mate came and thrust out
 his under lip and threshed his arms and
 cursed them and told them to belay he
 was watery-eyed with drink dangerous in
 his swinging arms he swung at them when
 they persisted in obeying arnie and
 drunk or not he was cunning

   vhat for he bellowed lean vicious
 vhat for vould you stir it up

   they paused then undecided amie or-
 dered him aside and he shook his head but
 one course remained and arnie lost not a
 moment in taking it he leaped forward
 the mate crouched in a twinkling the con-
 test for mastery was on

   the man rose could fight his lunges
 were terrible his reach appalling from out
 his buckled larboard-swung nose his breath

whistled frightfully a throaty language he
garbled as he fought for ten minutes the
gutting fire was almost forgotten almost of
no account amie bled at jaw and temple
and kept advancing one cheek stood out
puffed and growing swiftly blackish blue
in the end it was this unceasing advance
that told rose went down sought to
scramble backward as he got up flung out
a hand for support caught amies fist under
his chin and wallowed in the scuppers

  i snum said japes thets whaler
fightin in proper shape and went to see the
first case swung up on to the deck

  the hoisting hands seemed not to exert
themselves at all another followed-and
another amie stood watching out of his
one undamaged eye while they were opened
one held huge pieces of bent and rusted iron
one contained bits of plaster and broken
lathing out of the third poured a stream of
yellow sand the crew easily absorbed the
completeness of the hoax and jabbered and
laughed and hauled up more amie was si-
lent gray as chalk grew his visage still
mute he turned about and stared at the sea
comprehension made him sick the sweat
started out on him for a long time he
stood motionless except for a strange trem-
bling in his legs and arms the little yankee
cook stole to him presently

there be a ship on the staboard
bow he said in his patient sym-
pathetic fashion want i should sig-
nal er of them all he remained unaffected

  no said amie hard as flint rang his
voice clap on the hatch he commanded

  they commenced a rumbling protest
he stood over them until the passing ship
vanished still hull-down

  pumps he cried

  fingers of flame shot up in full sight
through the rakishly deposited hatch cover

  off with it pump for your lives turn
to or youre dead men

  a wild figure he was then at bay before
the world he stood zeesman had done this
-zeesman had betrayed him-and he was
tired-tired-tired in the attempt to save
zeesmans cargo zeesman and rose
what a fool he had been but not such a
fool as zeesman had hoped he would take
the ship in-aye if only three sticks of her
held together he would take her in burn-
ing in flames every board crackling under
him he was captain-el capitdn arrrnie

adventure

 his money was lost-every cent he
would see that it was lost the jessica would
make port and the little parchment-faced
official of san carlos with the greasy hair
would come out at his signal aad witness the
truth and send back word-aye he saw it
mow another man had been smarter than
he but that was nothing for he had been a
fool but fool or not it did not occur to
him to be a knave-

  fingers and tongue of flame where before
had been leisurely drifting smoke-the tar
bubbling and defiling the air-ignorant
cowed men crowding back-back-the sear-
ing stupefying blow of his discovery passed
slowly was beaten down and conquered
just as it had beaten down and conquered
the crying exhaustion of the last three days
in among them he strode grinning in his
bitterness of spirit

  weve found it now mates that was
his word to them forard the whole

-of it forard of the bulkhead pump

what are yuh fraid of strike up a tune
joe-thats the jack right under your fists
hark to it hiss will you

  he set the fashion by stripping to the
waist a crew were no better than their
captain he had always maintained and
the fighting desire gripped him now as it in-
variably did when the odds became too
great to measure hitherto he had fought
the elements alone against him in this hour
ranged the most terrible of all elements and
human cunning-terrific odds

  and the stakes was life not life as the
cowering crew saw it not the grinding out
of the days lelona he was bidding for
her at four thousand dollars he minded
not a bit paying such a price his bitternesss
came of quite another matter amies
idealism had received a jolt cause enough
for bitterness it rankled in his heart and
whipped him along-but there was lelona
grimly he pitted his resources physical and
mental against that devouring flame with
the ship under him lelona was his without
it the old story

  the little handful of men caught and re-
flected the intensity of his purpose fear-
stricken they were and for a time easy
marionettes naked arms and backs glis-
tened and ran the sound of panting vied
with the hissing and the roaring in the hold

  japes who scorned to announce how well
he had foreseen this disaster scurried from
galley to pumps and dragged himself too

weary to sing back to the galley again it
was his doing after all that these shaken
men kept to their stern unequal task
arnie felt the little mans nobleness like a
magnetic invigorating handshake

  and the night that rose deserted making
away in the starboard boat while the crew
strained at their labor and watched arnie
could never have held them but this bob-
bing homunculous with the emaciated face
gripped the pump-handle and panted of the
whalers grit and of husky arms that saw it
through and soon they were bawling

who guv us the art o the bold whalers heart
wy jonah-ol son-of-a-sea-cook-

  but after that night arnie knew he could
not trust them with the mates astound-
ing example glaringly vivid in their minds
he hardly dared close his eyes for fear they
had snatched the moment to steal the port
boat-for the fire did not die as he had
promised it would it leaped up higher and
higher it licked at the mast and set it
blazing it bounded incredibly and snipped
stays in two

  the worst sight was the conflagration of
the staysail in a terrible roar

  fighting fatigue became a grimmer enter-
prise than fighting the fire and when arnie
would take a turn below to work out his
reckonings there before him stood what
was left of zeesmans shrewdly conceived
gift-the red and amber and tawny bottles
he found himself reaching for them some-
times to take his tot of grog along with the
men who could not have continued without
stimulant to keep awake-to keep awake

  came a time when in his anguish the hot
tears fell when that was over he carried the
bottles on deck and mumbled through his
dry caked lips that they were prizes to be
worked for-the best man on the pumps-
a heart-tearing relief shook him then he
peered half-blinded with grime and smoke
at his wretched hands and arms and heard
the drumming top-hamper coo nex tam
when you come-

  and at length when the burden of water
in the hold dragged down the vessels head
and she would not steer and the laughing
sea seemed very sure it had won and the
forward deck lay charred and ready to
crumble the fire began to lose way to show
more and more smoke and blistered feet
could stand with less pain the feel of the
boards two days more and the reek of salt
southward



ashes turning cold came stronger than the
nauseating tar scent yawing plunging
rolling the jessica stumbled to port

it seemed to arnie he had never
looked upon so wondrous a sight be-
fore as this white and green hillside
above the roadstead of san carlos harbor
the crew gloomed from the rail like black-
birds on a fence surveying a harvested field
what could it mean to them but arnie
flung away his crying need of sleep dis-
carded the last remnant of bitterness
toward zeesman and fumbled blunderingly
at his jacket buttons his voice that called
for the boat to be lowered he did not recog-
nize the foolish boyish smile lit his hag-
gard face he had forgotten how to be
calm

  ashore on the disreputable street of the
town he found the port official and sent him
out to the ship his duty was done his
pulses thumped as he made up the ascent
to the broad-rambling hotel the purple
bougainvillea lifted its bloom for him to see
over gnarled tree-trunks streamed the love-
vine

  in at the kitchen door he looked a bit
tremulously lelona was not of those he
saw although they fetched him snapping
glances and seemed to recall him he went
around to the front and into the cool spa-
cious lobby he started so suddenly did she
appear in the center of his gaze his cheeks
burned all in an instant behind the desk
she sat her hands to her hair a solitary
stirring picture

  he went toward her the old-time grin
lighting his face the dare-devil arnie en-
deavoring to show through the hard-used
eyes the smoke-chapped mouth she per-
ceived him advancing and bent an apprais-
ing gaze upon him her dusky impelling
eyes recognized him her eyelids went up
she nodded smiling faintly

  a long time lelona he said got
tired of looking for me maybe i made it
though you knew i would eh captain
sondheim of the ship jessica

  so she answered politely his grin
grew less assured ah diablo-how you
look ugh you haf faunee smell

  she wrinkled her nose and laughed in the
music of a bell she said more while he
stood mute and bewildered by the manners
she had acquired the impersonal coolness
of her voice

  i rrremembair now-you nam eet-eet
ees-arrrnie-

  she seemed proud of her ability to recall
him

  he scarcely knew what to say he seemed
bereft of words dazed he blurted come
outside lelona and see my ship no kid-
ding lelona im captain

  she went with him rather reluctantly as
if ships were a very common sight-as in-
deed they were and the sailors from them
and captains too he waited for her to
speak when he had pointed out the jessica
lying visible below them but she did not
speak at first she laughed-and the laugh
was new to his ears it jarred his sensibili-
ties brought his face flaming

  you sheep she exclaimed then ah
no not a sheep a-wat you say-a lug-
gair

  and she laughed again he laughed with
her as best he could his heart felt con-
tracted he began to know how tired-
tired he was

  still he conquered the tiredness wrestled
with it and won he seized her hand and
patted it he would have kissed her then
and there but she modestly avoided him
and he understood how womanly she had
grown

  they talked for a while she so much more
the lady than he could comprehend but he
perceived with a fair mind that she was
right that there were captains and captains
depending upon their ships had he not
himself had doubts of zeesmans diminutive
antiquated craft yet somehow he felt
crushed and vaguely ashamed she had
expected more of him than he had accom-
plished and where on all the coast could he
find the vessel that she and he might glory
in

  stunned by this latest whim of fate he
wandered out on to the hillside where the
deep gloomy shade of the shaddock bent
above him dripping the heavy languorous
scent of the tropics somewhere in a remote
dell he dropped down and tried to think
there like a child that has played himself
out he fell asleep

  when he woke the day was almost spent
picking up his cap he trudged back to the
shore they saw him and sent a boat
japes welcomed him on deck like a jack-in-
the-box his thin face was one huge weary
beam of pride

  shes yers he cried zeesman aint

japes blinked monkey fashion he by no

                   o	hr

author of high trail and home trail what the old horse died of etc

tut we buried somebody gasped
 i mollie i went to the funeral
 myself if it wasnt archie
then who was it
f smith responded colonel t sambola
tunk imperturbably a person named
henry perkins smith i have discovered
reposes in the family vault where the tunks
seh of six generations sleep in peace

  oh lawdy murmured captain archi-
bald stretching out his legs luxuriously to
the sunshine smith can have it cunnel
with all due respect to the family tradi-
tions and all dont save any hole up there
for me mollie and i-after she got over
the fright of having me walk in the house
alive and kickin-went up and inspected
the last resting-place of the tunks and
leave it to me if i ever start any family
buryin-vault i want a few jazz accompani-
ments only cheerful thing we saw were
two little chameleons doin a shimmy right
on top the stone slab where you put this-
er-smith

  they seemed just glad that it wasnt
archie said mollie with a glance at the
tall cousin racing around intoxicated
with joy

  maam inquired colonel tunk oh
yes-lizards nobody minds em up there
say broke in captain archibald sud-
denly when you shipped this smith
person home from the baltimore hospital
and pulled off this bang-up funeral thinking
it was me what did the preacher say in his
sermon anyhow

  it was seh a most worthy and beautiful
tribute to you he alluded to you seh as a
bright and  shinin example of virtue
and-

  didnt allude to your last year in col-
lege giggled mollie or the time you and

bill calloway-

  soft pedal-soft pedal mollie pro-
tested the captain i reckon i should have
stayed in armenia with the relief com-
mission or been buried at home with all
these here beautiful tributes instead of-
half-pint smith



turnin up for this unholy resurrection it
was bill calloway who cabled home in the
first place that i had passed on but i cabled
a denial

  we never got it cried mollie did we
colonel

  never seh responded colonel tunk
detachedly sutiny not

  its been a dreadful year for funerals in
the family continued mollie first
granduncle eli tunk passed away at hot
springs and the colonel had to go and ar-
range for bringin him back then cousin
murray died way out in oregon and
colonel tunk had his remains shipped all
the way home then he heard you had
been invalided back from armenia and died
in baltimore and he gave you the most
touching burial ever held in mississippi
city--

  smith corrected captain archie
solemnly and he picked up a four-dollar
fiddle which uncle jasper had left on the
steps and sawed out a doleful dirge

  aint i some ghost though wait till
i breeze around town and see these folks
that wept at the touchin tribute but
smith-whatll all the old grannies say
about smith

  i seh answered colonel tunk grandly
have already anticipated that i thought
it best to make the explanations i went to
editor caswell of the bugle and furnished
him a brief summary of the-er-facts as
to smith i am already trying to trace the
mistake of the baltimore hospital people
through govement channels

  they mix up some guys something aw-
ful was smith in the service

  a civilian employe on war work seh
  get any trace of his folks

  not yet seh colonel tunk waved
his hand again with grandeur to indicate
that he alone was entirely equal to the
affair and that the word of a tunk sufficed
against a world of meddlers

  all right murmured the captain i
aint earin so long as it isnt me gosh
no

  and he proceeded to saw off on the fiddle
and sing something that old mandy in the
kitchen recognized with reassuring delight
as of old plantation days

     snakes in his whisky frawgs in his beer-

     the old man died with a rag in his ear

     the rag fell out an the breeze blew in

     an the old man took to drink agin

  mollie shook out her skirts and departed
vigorously

  well you can drive around to the cole-
mans and pick me up archie she called
im just crazy to see what people say about
it you never did turn up in this com-
munity since your freshman days without
raisin some kihd of rumpus but this is the
limit after all that hero stuff you ought
to have seen the floral anchor that the
coleman girls sent you

  anchor nothin retorted archie why
didnt they make it a corkscrew i never
could stand sea travel-sick as a pup all the
way from bordeaux

  and when miss mollie had gone archie
continued to sit on the step gaze up the
hill at the ancient burying-vault of the tunk
family and draw most awful yowls and
groans out of the four-dollar fiddle

  colonel tunk looked at his nephew
cryptically archie went on with his
fiddling as far as captain archibald
tunk recently of the armenian relief
commission was concerned the incident
was closed he ought to be satisfied
never alive and fiddling could archie hope
to win the encomiums that were lavished
on him supposedly sealed up fine and tight
in a lead casket and as for smith an ordi-
nary person like smith could never aspire to
enter the first families of mississippi city
mississippi save as he had done feet first
via the tunk mausoleum

  mollies going to get the bugle account
of my buryin mused archie she says
now i got to live up to what reverend t a
bascom said about me in his sermon

  he was eloquent seh over your

remains-

  ree-mains go easy on this ree-mains
stuff any time cunnel i aint able to turn
up and lug along my own ree-mains why
ill go up the hill and tell smith to move
over and quit pullin the kivers and what
you goin to do about henry perkins smith
suppose they have you pinched for kid-
nappin

  who seh

  the smith family

  the world seh is full of smiths that
is why seh i chose- colonel tunk
checked himself slowly and pulled at his
white mustache well i suppose archi-
bald seh-i should make a little dis-
closure

  hey


adventure

  archibald ceased fiddling and sat up
colonel t sambola tunk rarely made dis-
closures what a tunk of mississippi
city mississippi deigned to impart to the
world never came as a confidence but as a
fiat

  i feel seh that the mystery of henry
perkins smith can never be fully cleared
up already it seems enmeshed in gove-
mental red tape by certain officious officials
at washington seh and it is beneath the
dignity of a tunk seh to enter into con-
troversy over such an unfortunate matter
yes but there are a million smiths in
the united states and suppose somebody
turns up and claims henry perkins
and-

  colonel tunk cleared his throat and
straightened his string tie one might say
that gobs oodles of disaster were yanked
out of the abyss into which he had con-
signed smith by this young man and
dumped down upon the serene path which a
tunk should travel

  i might say archibald in passin to
relieve your mind that nobody ever will
claim this h p smith and as i state in
my communication to the bugle the tunks
will extend to this po unfortunate un-
claimed stranger the utmost hospitality
that the family buryin-vault affords the

tunks-

  oh my aunt jerusha murmured
archie nobody gives a whoop the
point is that this poor devil-and anyhow
how do you know that no onell ever claim
his ree-mains

  because seh-by january first there
wont be any

  be any what are you drivin at
kunnel

  smith seh isa myth

  what

- smith seh is a subterfuge i confess i
invented picture seh a mind perturbed
and desperate a soul eaten out with sorreh
and despair confronted when you came
back suddenly with the necessity of de-
ceit

  great guns kunnel archie arose
suddenly laying down the four dollar fiddle
to gaze at his uncle as at one demented
what do you mean no smith who
the mischief did you bury then seein it
wasnt me

  you seh also were a-a pretext you
seh seemed perfectly safe and secure bein

as the report had come of your demise
months ago and i merely had to make a
sorrehful pilgrimage noth to bring back
your-remains you seh invalided home
and passin away in baltimore when as a
matter of fact you had returned to armenia
or babylon or somewhere without com-
municating with us seh

  blessed if i knew they still thought i was
dead i was ordered back abroad on short
notice and mollie never got my wire

  yes seh you seemed perfectly safe and
reliable i seh it must be admitted
neve journeyed to baltimore on that sad
mission i was in frankfort kentucky
with my old friend judge bleeker seh on a
matter of business a situation seh-i
might say a dilemma-confronted us both

suddenly-

 bleeker archie sat down and
whistled old judge bleeker and you
well i guess-just grabbin around at
clues and suspicions and surmises-that
somehow it has to do with liquor

  seh colonel tunk extended an arm
loftily in the present fanatical and ex-
cited state o public feelin in this county
and with miss mollie president of the local
anti-liquor league- hush

  old bob bleeker mused archie

well im a son-av-a-

  your remains seh continued colonel
tunk placidly but with a keen look around
came back in half-pint bottles your
hermetically sealed casket i can relate with
satisfaction held just two barls of half-pint
bottles packed in excelsior and they came
over the state-line and into this county
where the vandals watch every automobile
road and express-office with fiendish assi-
duity with perfect safety and dispatch
me yelped the ghost feebly two
barls of half-pint bottles

  twelve-year-old bourbon seh it may
be a source of pride to you archibald to be
the best whisky that i eve was able to im-
port since this glorious but fanatical re-
public made it a crime fo a gentleman to
take his little jigger every mawnin your
granduncle eh tunk seh who passed
away a decade ago at hot springs was
brought back to the family plot last may
but the best he afforded was seven-year-old
stuff and as for your cousin murray he
came back to repose among his forebears
with no moen sixteen gallons of mountain-
corn liquor to assuage and soften the
half-pint smith



sorrehs of the last remainin membeh of the
tunk family

  cunnel gasped archie you mean
to say you got away with it

  slowly and with reverent hands seh
i been lookin up the family mortuary
records and bringing each prodigal son
home to rest where hell do mo good than
merely run up bills from the undertakers
as to you archie you seemed perfectly
safe-perfectly mournin fo you as i did
i didnt see why you should rest far away
and alone in a govement cemetery and
when you turned up seh joyful as i was to
greet you i was beset with the knowledge
that i had to have somebody in that family-
vault to avert curiosity seh that explains
smith and allows me to give out what info-
mation i wish to the world concernin
him

 smith-smith murmured captain
archie seems like i heard that name
before-h p smith poor old smith-
henry p smith no wonder mollie and i
saw those two little chameleons doin
hootchy-kootchies over his slab maybe
they each had a nip-communing with
the spirits as it were and realizing what i
do about the tunks its my opinion cunnel
that instead of dust to dust as the scrip-
tures have it our ancestors are more apt to
turn to sour mash

  seh said colonel tunk loftily as the
last remainin male descendent of the family
you should speak with mo respect for yo
ancestors

  i respect them as connoisseurs of hard
liquor all right even if the service did
teach me to be a total abstainer but
think of old dr bascom preaching that
touchin sermon over a pine box full of
bourbon and cousin mollie president of
the county -anti-liquor league say
cunnel

  seh

  suppose smith turns up

  impossible seh

  the worlds full of em suppose the
government bureau claims these here ree-
mains you better step careful old plot-
ter im going to get the car out and run
out to the coleman place for tea and fill up
these ree-mains of mine on beaten biscuit
and cold ham southern style think of
that blamed musty old buryin-vault
ow it makes a hole in my stomach when
i reflect on it u

hthe ghost uprose and dusted his
trousers colonel tunk watched
him crank up the car and depart
down the county-pike then he sighed
and went to mix himself a toddy on the
back-stairs after which he dropped an
empty half-pint bottle behind the wainscot
when he passed out mandy winked wisely
as she went about the dinner preparations
she didnt know where colonel tunk got it
but his little jigger turned up every morn-
ing and twice thereafter during the day
even the suspicious miss mollie now and
then knew that spirits pervaded the back
regions of the ancestral house but that it
was henry perkins smith taking a little
resurrection each day under the colonels
chaperonage never crossed her mind
mollie merely winked to herself also

  needless to say the advent of captain
archibald belden tunk late of the ar-
menian relief work and before that of the
argonne trenches into the countryside
homes of all the nice girls he knew excited
a sensation as a ghost archibald was an
instant success when the bugle appeared
with its congratulatory column containing
a dignified interview with colonel t sam-
bola tunk himself which set forth briefly
how the unfortunate mistake was made in
baltimore and a total stranger was interred
in the private family-vault archie backed
into a corner and threw up his hands
blessed if i know dont ask me i
was the dead one wasnt i as for this
smith-poor devil-never heard of him
before anybody mind if i take a little
more of that shrimp salad since i came
back from the great beyond i got an
appetite like a whale

  anyhow youre much nicer com-
mented edith coleman you and bill
were the village cutups before the war
youre rather mellowed now

  aged in wood retorted captain tunk
darkly five months in the family-
tombll sober anybody er-come to think
of it maybe it wouldnt in our family

  and the tunk ghost grinned wisely and
took a partner for a dance

  it was on the way home that cousin
mollie burst out with a confidence

  archie what do you think we did
edith and i we thought it was awful
about smith perhaps somewhere theres
a family waiting and watching in vain for
news of him i can appreciate it after those


adventure

dreadful months when we thought you had
been killed edith has a friend whos con-
nected with the war department at wash-
ington so we wrote him a letter all about
smith and couldnt they trace his people
what gurgled archie oh no let
smith rest in peace

  but his family even the worst news is
better than-suspense

  family why he-his family-its con-
traband-outlawed-impossible

  what on earth is the matter with you
i- archie felt of his adams apple and
swallowed it hurriedly see here mollie
for the honor of the tunks-for decencys
sake and everything-you cut this out
now i tell you cut it out that fool
bugle editor wired this yam out everywhere
it seems and it-its a nation-wide sensa-
tion there may be a million dog-gone
smiths who left home and never came back
and maybe about forty relations will claim
these ree-mains

  well suppose they do theyre en-
titled to em arent they

  gosh no you-youll start a riot
faltered the captain you and the cole-
man girls let this smith business alone
he-he and me-our ree-mains as it were-
kind o mixed up by that fool govement
red-tape but were both happy smith
hes gone to his reward and me im full of
sandwiches and things but dont stir those
bureaucrats in washington up to digging
into our mortuary records the cunnel
poor old codger  be pained and grieved
hes been going up there every day putting
flowers on my grave with reverent hands
and smith cant kick nor any of his family
you girls let the cunnel settle this business
but he cant now because edith cole-
man got a letter right back from her to-
day and she wrote the sweetest dearest
letter thanking everybody seems that
they located her the very first thing
who what

 his widow mrs henry perkins
smith

  help yelled the captain dodging a
mud-hole dizzily widow oh no

  she did said she had heard of colonel
tunks beautiful care for her dear husbands
remains and what a grand man he was and
everything and shes coming here to thank
him personally and everything

  captain archibald belden tunk stopped
the car just as it turned in the avenue

among the ancestral oaks the big house
was dark but his headlight cast a ray of
light far up the hill under the magnolias
upon the ancient tomb of the tunks of
mississippi city mississippi

  mollie you didnt youre crazy and
sos mrs smith this guy you buried he-
well she-mrs smith is a-mistaken
thats all we dont want any widda
snoopin around here after him shed be

a-nuisance and the cunnel he-hes

got kind o attached to smith now puttin
flowers on his slab and everything the
poor old cunnel has kind o run out of an-
cestors now and hed like to hang onto this
h p smith a while did she say she
wanted to remove these-ree-mains

  of course she wants to their family
home is in cincinnati

  archie helped her out by the garage
cincinnati me eye shes mistaken
thats all i wish that i had stayed in ar-
menia or hades or somewhere out o sight
archie what in the world is the matter
with you its perfectly plausible but
you talk like a lunatic if you hadnt
sworn off in the army id think youd been
drinking

  its smith gulped archie dismally
and this widda-ill bet shes some old
battle-ax thatll worry the cunnel into his
grave

and it was the following morning
that mandy coming in from the
r f d box on the county road
laid by colonel tunks breakfast plate a
square black-margined envelope mollie
and captain archibald saw it simultane-
ously cousin mollie had just seated her-
self and no opportunity had presented itself
yet to tell colonel tunk the news

  now she rested her dimpled chin on her
white hands and watched expectantly
across from her the ghost from armenia
dug widly down in his egg-cup it wasnt
until watching covertly he saw colonel
tunks hand tremble as he read the missive
that archibald glanced up guiltily

  then abruptly colonel t sambola tunk
arose and strode they saw him disappear
wordlessly behind the back stairs pres-
ently came a curious gurgle a gentle fall
behind the wainscot after that it was so
still one could have heard a cork drop

  there goes a half-pint murmured
archie absently
half-pint smith



  a-what said mollie staring after
the colonels retreat

  er-smith its that widda my dear
coz got the cunnel all upset here she
comes hornin into this business tryin to
separate the cunnel from his good departed
friend smith

  well why in the name of all thats silly
shouldnt she mollie was round-eyed
with indignant interest why should the
colonel feel upset over the removal of the
remains of a man he never saw or heard of
until five months after he buried him by
mistake in the family-tomb

  thats it

  what

  movin smith he might-jingk
whats the matter with you anyway
archie jingle

  archie uprose and waved his napkin
feebly

  never mind poor old cunnel and he
too went out the back way

  he found colonel tunk reading again the
widow smiths daintily written and feel-
ingly worded note of gratitude if a pint-
size ghost of henry perkins smith had sud-
denly appeared and blown up suddenly
until he was the size of the tunk back
pasture lot colonel tunk could not have
looked more abysmally flabbergasted

  seh he whispered and extended the
letter silently

  never mind said archie reassuringly
there aint no such animal as the widda
smith so why be scared of her

  she says so seh

  thats all right take her in cunnel
entertain her lad the old girl along until
we see some way out says she must at
least lay a wreath of immortelles on his
grave say what she ought to bring is a
basket of mint ill hook some sugar
cunnel and well hold a service for smith
thatll bring five generations of tunks out
of their tombs upstanding

  seh this woman must not be allowed on
the place

  you try to stop her and shell raise a
row and only attract more notoriety to this
mixup and you know what the penalty
is in this state for shippin in booze to say
nothing of the federal amendment no
you got to soothe the widdas feelins and
assuage her grief

  if shes got a missin husband named
henry perkins smith why you cant go

ahead and deny it now any more pub-
licity about it and the coroner or some-
bodyll want to open up that casket old
omar khayyam said he wanted to be buried
so that every unbeliever passin by would
lick his chops but he couldnt do it in these
states under the dry amendment cun-
nel

  never mind omar seh this smith
woman arrives tomorrow but as a matter
of fact she writes like a lady

  you better go meet her at the train and
keep her away from the hotel the one
best bet for you cunnel is to avoid people
talkin some fool coroner or health officer
or somebody may go to buttin in if the
widda smith is allowed to tell her troubles
around town you got to persuade her to
let friend smith stay right where he is
you got to be her sympathetic friend
cunnel with a heart that bleeds every time
you think of her bereavement

  tell her that her h p smith does honor
to the tunks lyin there so still among em
ill loan you my funeral sermon cunnel and
you can read it to her and ill join in and
well all weep together why if that missin
husband of hers who was shipped some-
where from a baltimore hospital accordin
to her letter never turns up were all fine
and happy buck up cunnel

  colonel tunk sighed heavily and went into
the house he refused to be heartened and
besides he reflected if this nephew of his
had only stayed in armenia this widow
smith nemesis wouldnt be camping on his
trail colonel tunk feared all widows
and one who wrote him with the gratitude
that mrs henry perkins smith voiced in
her letter was doubly dangerous shed
hang on his shoulder perhaps at the tomb
and weep through his linen coat and sob
out the virtues and endearments of henry
the departed

  i must he seh like a gentleman and a
bootlegger he reflected

  and it was with all his lofty equanimity-
on the outside at least-that colonel tunk
set forth on the delicate mission of meeting
mrs henry perkins smith the colonel
abhorred gas-wagons so arrayed in his best
linen trousers and black mohair coat he set
forth in the surrey which he had purchased
the year of the cotton exposition with
hogjaw his best-mannered field-hand
driving from the rear seat colonel tunk
waved to mollie and the captain who were
i

adventure

setting off for a round of golf at thfe counl
club grounds

  arckie said miss mollie determinedly
lets dine at the club itll be awful to hear
the colonel and the widow sit there and dis-
cuss smith

  youre on i guess ill let the old boy
handle her hell give her all the old
family history and show her all the oil-
painted tunks stuck around the dinin-
room and she can descant on the late henry
perkins and his virtues

  they whizzed past the colonel with frolic-
some greeting a mile down the pike
archie had to dodge to the ditch to avoid a
big green touring-car that roared on past
the country club corner looking back
they saw colonel tunks pair of bays rear
up wildly when the monster honked on its
way

  the colonel jammed his panama over his
eyes and turned indignantly while hogjaw
was quieting the span and he saw the
big green car rush a corner and up intothe
quiet poplar avenue leading to his afllestral
home

  hogjaw seh said the colonel sternly
who were those persons

  those pussons am a lady cunnel-and
shes done gittin out at de big house
colonel tunk started apprehensively and
frowned then round about he sent his
ancient equipage the big green car stood
untenanted before his porticoed mansion
no one was on the veranda no one in the
double parlors in the kitchen he found
black mandy staring out frightenedly

  missus smif ejaculated mandy and
she done gone up dyah

  ahem said the colonel and straighten-
ing his tie and buttoning his coat he strode
up the gravel toward the family vault on
the hill with a nervous trepidation he re-
called nephew archies last warning-
now dont let this old girl beat you to the
first punch cunnel

hbijt when the colonel rounded the
stone mausoleum he felt palpitat-
ingly that she had she stood there
before the grated door peering in-a slen-
der black-robed figure relieved by just one
burst of color and that was the armful of
roses that she carried and she was curi-
ously inspecting something she had picked
up at her feet

  it was a cork a half-pint cork and

colonel tunk stood rubbing his chin with
more dire apprehension how did that
fool cork come there

  the widow sighed and put her handker-
chief to her mouth patting it resignedly
then she turned seeing him colonel
tunk bowed grandly

  mrs smith i presume

  she was watching him with great dark
sorrowful eyes and the colonel palpitated
within never had the tunk plantation
given refuge to such a vision in her
mourning she had the mode the grace the
smoothness of the woman who knows how
to wear things best she wasnt young the
colonel hastily decided and yet she wasnt
old if her hair had a touch of silver above
her small ears it but enhanced her petiteness

  ah-hem murmured colonel tunk and
took a determined glance into her eyes
they were soft dark eyes looking up at him
sympathetically now

  yes she said appealingly did you
mind me coming here you were not at
the house and the servant told me to wait
but i wanted to see-dear henry how
you have cared for him-the flowers and
everything

 seh-maam-i-he-wods fail me
maam we appreciate-we-maam were
glad to have him no seh-not that

exactly but-

  i know you are a dear kind gentle-
man i know all about it colonel and i-
we-the family can never forget your solici-
tude for-henry

  what tenderness in that glance she gave
him it had been years since colonel
tunks chivalry had felt such appeal

  he waved a courtly hand to the flower-
covered slab within the iron grating

  our po feeble efforts seh-maam fo
your revered husband who i understand
gave his life fo his country as gallantly as

any hero on the field of battle-

  he was a mutton inspector in a purchas-
ing department

  yes yes i know maam colonel
tunk didnt know but he was glad for even
this irrelevant clue to henry perkins

  your dear gallant nephew captain
tunk was restored to you as by a miracle
i hear

  yes maam-walked in on us as a ghost
from the grave searin my house-servants
into conniption fits maam and with an
appetite like a horse with our joy maam
half-pint smith



came our utter sadness to learn of-of mr
smith

  she dabbled the handkerchief to her nose
and when the colonel unlocked the family-
vault she silently laid her offering on
henrys tomb with a cautious sniff
colonel tunk looked at the iron plate on
the stone slab that held henry secure
with her back to him the widow gave a
poignant little sob reverently the colonel
waited and presently touched her arm

  our home maam is at your service
while here we feel mrs smith that as
time heals your grief you will feel differently
about removing er-mr smith

  oh i couldnt i must take him back
to cincinnati

  she spoke with distinct eagerness
colonel tunk bowed on the way to the
house he alluded to the honor he felt in hav-
ing henry perkins smith in the tomb of his
ancestors and delicately she thanked him
but demurred

  and when mollie and the captain came
rolling in at dusk the latter gave one incred-
ulous stare up on the front veranda

oh mollie-oh whos the chicken
hush up whispered mollie but when
these two came on and met colonel tunks
grave introduction she also gasped in-
credulously

  mrs henry perkins smith was all sweet-
ly reservedly animated in an hour archi-
bald was eating from her hand and mollie
unbending despite herself to the charm and
graciousness of smiths widow with the
utmost delicacy she related her six months
search through government channels for
inspector smith after his sad demise in the
baltimore hospital and how but for cap-
tain archies turning-up she never would
have found him

  he had been a devoted husband a dear
rare fellow she concluded with poignant
resignation that made colonel tunk blink
in the dusk

  at twenty dollars a quart mused
archie henry is dear all right

  and the next day it rained nobody
could go out the widow played sad sweet
old things with colonel tunk leaning over
the piano after a too too sympathetic
glance at her appealing eyes colonel tunk
would retire behind the back-stairs and mix
a melancholy toddy

  archie seh he sighed if it quits
rainin i am goin to drive mrs smith over

to judge brandegees fo a call we must
take her mind off this-bereavement
you better first get it off your breath
cunnel you told me your limit was a half-
pint a day but you been hit tin em highern
that if i was you id go make a dean
breast of it to this poor lady

  and consign her seh to further fruit-
less wanderins and searchins fo her de-
parted husband no seh i hope to per-
suade her to-to prolong her visit seh to
allow henry perkins smith to rest as he is
hey said archie interestedly you
-colonel all spruced up today

  colonel tunk dusted his panama and
took mrs smith to drive sunday night
he took her to tea at the colemans tues-
day he induced her to golf a bit and mollie
gasped to find her on the club veranda with
half the benign old gentlemen of the coun-
tryside about her chair young sprigs
tried to worm in on the charming widow
also but she seemed distinctly to prefer the
old boys with cloves on their breaths

all that rainy week mrs henry
perkins smith was a house-guest
not only of colonel tunk but of
other first families the widow relented a
bit from her melancholy detachment it
was rumored that she had mixed a julep for
old judge brandegee and had been admit-
ted to the gilfishes private wine-cellar and
everywhere colonel sambola tunk followed
her with holy devotion pride and humility

  archie gasped mollie what do you
think of that the colonel hasnt cared a
rap about society in twenty years and look
what that widows doin to him despite her
mournin

  got both judge brandegee and senator
casewell callin on her sunday night offerin
condolences i reckon and between you
and me the widdassittin up takin notice
it-its almost scandalous the way shes
wormed her way into all these old county
families through these old geezers who aint
used to a woman takin notice of em ill
bet she isnt more than forty

  well if you girls had half her stuff
mollie youd be wonders sympathy-
sym-path-ee thats where she gets eml
its enough to make poor old henry p
turn over in his bottle

  his what

  oh neve mind there she goes up the
hill now on her daily pilgrimage to henrys


adventure

grave look at the colonel all diked out in
new pongee pants wonderin if he dare
follow and intrude on her grief

  its awful burst out mollie the way
he moons around every time she goes up
there he goes up there

  she darted a vigorous irreverent finger
toward the family burying-plot

  hed better said the captain darkly
a little widda is a dangerous thing hes
trying to distract her mind from henry
perkins i reckon

  whats she so interested in our family
for yesterday i was waiting for edith
in the ladies parlor of the maddox house
when mrs smith came in and wrote a tele-
gram bell-hop came for it and then he
brought it back because there was some
bother about the address the widow was
in the telephone booth and the boy laid the
telegram down just where i couldnt help
glancing at it and what do you think it
said

  send more flowers for henry sug-
gested archie hopefully

  no it was just mysterious it read
see file no -tunk file no -
gilfish file no -tunk archie
what in the world do you think

  must be something official about this
mix-up me and henry gettin our ree-
mains all balled up in the government hos-
pital said archie gosh i hope they
dont finally decide that im the dead one
and what do you think then

  me i dont think the cunnels got
to do the thinkin

 but she left her hand-bag lying near me
when she telephoned and sticking out of it
by accident i saw a-a-monkey-wrench
a what

  a teeny brand-new little monkey-
wrench

  captain tunk looked puzzled he
whistled and crossed his legs

  maybe he opined solemnly after some
thought that shes got a spirit message
from the other world maybe henrys
stuck outside the pearly gates and hes
plottin to take em off their hinges some
time when the guardian angels aint lookin
and sneak in

  oh my goodness me arent you get-
tin afraid of her

  i aint had a chance mollie-with all
these old bald-headed boobs hangin around
her all the time i just want her to stop

buzzin around about henry those
blamed government bureau chaps have al-
ready had me dead on the records and may
be theyd rather insist on it than try to
untangle all the red-tape mess

  youre the livest thing around here this
season

  except smith give henry half a
chance and hed be the real speed-demon in
these parts on judgment day when
smith- and then archie sat up straightly
stared at the widow smith in the afternoon
sunlight there alone before the resting-
place of tunks dead and gone and then at
colonel t sambola tunk all youthfully
tricked out sitting on the fence back of the
house lot

  resurrection whispered archie mon-
key-wrench--oh my prophetic reemains
cunnel

  and leaving mollie staring and amazed at
his mystery archie disappeared he im-
mediately reappeared through the kitchen
past the astounded mandy elbowing her
aside and reached colonel tunk who was
still gazing after the widow wistfully

  cunnel repeated archie is that
vault door opened

  opened sutiny seh mrs smith
has the keys seh now always she is up
there layin flowers as usual on the slab seh
and at-her customary hour of devotion
dabbin her eye with a lavender-bor-
dered handkerchief i suppose and reflectin
on the virtues and achievements of mutton
inspector smith oh cunnel

  seh

  look out

  seh

  this here sacred hour of the widdas
how have you been accustomed to bustin
in on smith every mornin for your little
jigger of hooch

how i merely remove seh the little
iron plate by unscrewing the bolts and take
out my little half-pint jigger each mawnin
and a couple of times you dropped a
cork and-hold on shes lookin

  archie dropped behind the hedge and
wigwagged colonel tunk the latter up-
rose with dignity and grasped his cane
firmly

  mrs smith seh is not lookin she has
gone in fo her accustomed reflective hour
with what she believes is her dear departed

at such a time seh-

  youre lost whispered archie go
half-pint smith



head her off-quick confront her cunnel
and remember that from the walls of our
old vault forty tunks look down upon you
archibald seh i but yesterday per-
suaded the dear lady to leave smith re-
main where he is a matter of sentiment

seh which as a kindred soul-

  that doesnt help youll get pinched
for blockade-runnin thats what with
uncle eli and cousin murray tunk and all
the bunch you never brought their re-
mains back home at all and when the

sheriff looks em up-

  colonel tunk arose grandly far be it
from him to listen to calumnies

  come with me seh indelicate as it is
to intrude on this sacred hour i wish you to
see the depths of her grief i can swear to
it seh

  archie gave him one curious glance and
followed they crossed the soft turf back
of the ancient vault and colonel tunk was
about to place a firm foot on the graveled
walk when his nephew stopped him

  listen breathed the latter did you
ever hear a ghost gurgle its smith

  on the evening air there did come a
curious sound a tinkle a sobbing trickle
and yet a sort of joyous note it made
colonel tunks mouth water despite a sud-
den perturbation at his heart archibald
listened again and then he backed away
with a whisper

  this isnt none of my funeral not this
time cunnel

colonel tunk watched his de-
parture back to the house-hedge
with composure apparently at
least if there was a crisis he was the tunk
equal to it squaring his shoulders he
stepped around and looked within his an-
cestral tomb mrs henry perkins smith
was there and she was bending over henrys
slab

  she was deftly removing an article or
two then she held a half-pint bottle to
the light inspected it with a nonchalant
eye and poured it as a libation before uncle
elis marble niche then she laughed de-
murely and with the little monkey-wrench
began tightening the bolts on the oblong
iron plate that marked the end-at least
one end- of henry perkins smith

  the colonel watched her slim little hand
strain at the wrench-handle tightening
henry up so that the casual observer would

not notice that he had been tampered with
was no easy task the colonel felt almost
constrained to assist her but he waited
without

  a high resolve had come to colonel tunk
one mighty beam of light through the abys-
mal depths into which smith had con-
signed him a napoleonic coup was needed
or he was undone forever

  when he heard the rustle of her black
silken gown he made an apologetic cough
to let the widow know he was at his cus-
tomary vigil outside they were wont to
stroll on up the wooded hill of evenings
after mrs smiths devotional hour now
when she came out closing her litde beaded
bag with a satisfied smile the colonel even
heard the monkey-wrench clink gently
against a half-pint of smith in that bag
but he raised his hat with more than his
usual suavity

  evenin maam

  good evening colonel

  clearin weather

  isnt it grand just to be alive there
was brimming come-hitherness in her voice
her eye shot a merry little twinkle up at the
colonels

  alive oh undoubtedly as my nephew
frequently remarks

  i should think he would murmured the
widow pensive now and that makes me
remember dont you realize it is time we
made the final arrangements for the re-
moval of my dear departed husbands re-
mains to cincinnati ive been here two
weeks-your guest colonel tunk

  why cincinnati ohio mr smith
maam i feel he belongs here now and
you-youve brought two weeks of-of-
well seh maam couldnt you make it a
little longer

  she was looking at her trim feet as she sat
on the ancient iron seat on the pathway

  longer you have been so good as it
is so delicately good in my-sorrow i
feel somehow i have abused your hos-
pitality

  colonel tunk was seated now his hand
touched her shoulder as he turned to look at
her averted face

  sorreh maam is the bond between us
i feel grief i might say has sealed a-
ah it has endeared you to us maam and

cincinnati ohio-

  it will be lonely there she sighed

  the colonel could have sworn that tears


adventure

were in her dark eyes at least she patted
them with a handkerchief and then had to
cease for the colonel took her hand away

  lonely as my house maam with you
departed mrs smith seh-maam-i am
askin you to stay-its mistress

  he felt her start then she was staring
at him and laughed almost wildly he
wouldnt let her withdraw her fingers from
his own

  colonel

  and marry me maam

  colonel

  are you thinkin of smith laid in this
untimely grave

smith she suddenly turned on him
her eyes filled with tears but laughter strug-
gling through them smith-is a myth
you astound me said the colonel
solemnly

  listen you dear unsuspecting charm-
ing man there isnt any smith im not
his widow my name is preston-mrs
laura preston and ive been a widow nine
years and i-colonel-am an agent of
the united states prohibition enforcement
branch of the secret service sent into this
county to get acquainted with-with cer-
tain persons who are breaking the law
and i used you to-oh forgive me

  and then a strange thing happened she
seemed about to cry and colonel tunk up-
rose and clasped mrs henry perkins smith
in his arms to stop it and she let him do
it she didnt say a word for a moment
and then she began to murmur brokenly
against his new alpaca coat

  i just hate myself for this i just hate
that work i wish i had never seen you or
any one here where youve been so good it
was all my work but i thought you were a

blockade-runner in this county

  me maam-a bootleggers agent

  i know better now it was all for your
own seh but these family funerals-
cousin murray and uncle eli

  they have all gone murmured colonel
tunk lugubriously to the last pint maam
all but about seven gallons of-smith
oh i know ive just investigated and
my suspicions were right-and it was smith
did it in the first place when he was archie
seh-maam

  in the atlanta baggage-room where he
he was transferred-smith jingled i just
happened to be passing and i had a-
hunch colonel

  cornin to think of it now maam he
was just one pint short to the barl

  but we couldnt interfere when we
thought it was poor archibald it was the
unknown smith that gave me my chance to
track you down oh colonel

  colonel tunk was majestically silent but
he still held smiths widow to his heart even
if in her hand-bag he did hear smith jingle
against the monkey-wrench

  well dear mrs laura preston if i may
say so seh-maam-what are you goin to
do now i-confess to-henry perkins
smith maam and what-as a federal
agent are you goin to do now

my report on this case to the chief and
mark it closed theyll take my word
for it then ill resign

  and then-please maam

  ill marry you old dear

back to the blue wall

we reached the ohio and i
soon found a canoe the trip
down the scioto had its danger
thrills and twice we narrowly
escaped meeting bands of warriors on the
main trace i stuck to the path because of
its advantages none below us knew we
had left the upper town and would not be
looking for us in the beaten path there
was much less chance of leaving signs for
some scout to pick up and follow i knew
warriors would be scouring the country in
all directions once the news of our escape
was carried to chillicothe but the scioto
path was the last one they would expect
us to take

  i had remembered lost sisters warning
and planned to follow the big sandy until
its headwaters interlocked with those of the
clinch and holston it was nerve-wearing
work that crossing of the ohio with each
dip of the paddle i expected rifles to crack
behind me and canoes to poke their noses
through the overhanging foliage and make
after us i could not see that the girl
breathed during the crossing and i kept
her in front of me as her face was  mirror

to reflect instantly any danger on the indian
shore

  we landed at the mouth of four-mile
creelt without any disturbing incidents i
told her we were four miles above the mouth
of the scioto and she was for placing more
distance between us and that river at once
but it was impossible to travel all the time
now we were foot-free and as i had my
rifle the shawnees would pay high before
catching up with us i assured her i had
been at four-mile creek the year before to
survey five hundred acres of good bottom-
land for patrick henry and was of course
familiar with the locality

  five hundred yards back from the ohio
was an old fort i took the girl there to rest
while i patched our moccasins the indians
said this structure was so ancient that no one
knew who built it as a matter of fact it
was the remains of george croghans stone
trading-house traces of an indian town
antedating the fort were also to be observed
very possibly it was occupied by the shaw-
nees before they built their first town at the
mouth of the scioto on the west bank it
was from this scioto town that mary ingles
escaped in  and the history of her dar-
ing and hardships rather belittled my feat
in bringing patricia from the upper
town




adventure

  the poor girl continued extremely ner-
vous and i feared she would collapse now
that she had tasted freedom she feared the
indians were hot on our trail her gaze was
constantly roving to the ohio she was
fearing to behold the shawnees paddling
across to recapture us the moccasins had
to be mended however as the night travel
down the scioto path had sadly damaged
them

  as i sewed the whangs through the rips
and hastily patched the holes i could see her
worriment was increasing that period of
delay was more trying to her fortitude than
when we were making the detour around
chillicothe and our very lives hung on luck
or the mercy of her manito

  there is something in the river she
whispered her slight figure growing rigid

  only a log i told her

  look isnt there something moving in
the bushes and she clutched my arm

  only the wind ruffling the tops i
soothed

  she was silent for a few minutes and then
confessed

  i dread and hate the river basdel i
wish we could get out of sight of it

  its a short trip in the canoe to the big
sandy

  and with the possibility of an indian
hiding behind every stump and log along
the shore

  then we will hide the canoe and strike
across the bend a few creeks to cross and
inside of two days we should reach the big
sandy its about thirty-five miles and
there is the blaze left by the surveyors do
you wish that it will be harder for your
feet than riding in the canoe it may be
easier on your nerves

  anything basdel to get away from the
river and cant we start now i know we
shall see the indians coming across to catch
us if we stay here much longer

  i tossed her her moccasins and quickly
mended mine and put them on leaving
her to wait until i could draw up the canoe
and hide it i proceeded to conceal all traces
of our landing as best i could and then told
her i was ready

  the bottoms on this side of the river are
narrower than on the indian shore and the
old surveyors blaze proved to be a wet path
the small creeks were bordered with cane
and when we encountered them it was hard
on the girl but she minded hardships none

and once we were out of sight of the river
she regained some of her spirits but a
glimpse of the blue river brought back her
old fears as though the ohio were some
monster able to reach out and seize her

  before night i proved the river could be
good to us against her will i had swung
down to the shore and was leading her along
a narrow beach in order to escape a bad
tangle of briers when i had the good fortune
to discover a bateau lodged against the bank
the girl begged me not to go near it al-
though it was obviously empty i insisted
and was rewarded with a bag containing a
bushel of corn now we could have cooked
it in our kettle had we been provided with
that indispensable article as it was there
was life in munching the corn

  the undergrowth was a nuisance being
composed of pea-vines clover nettles cane
and briery berry bushes the nettles too
constituted a grave menace because of the
ease with which they broke down wher-
ever the foot was placed a print was left
even the tracks of wild turkeys were
discernible

  i would not stop to camp until i could
reach a tract free from the stuff as a
result it was nearly sunset by the time we
halted in a mixed growth of hickory iron-
wood and ash on the banks of a tiny creek
here we could pick a path that left no signs
we rested a bit and then followed the creek
toward its outlet for half a mile and came
to a log cabin

  the girl dropped to the ground glaring
as if we were beholding the painted head of
a shawnee i assured her it was a white
mans cabin and probably empty leaving
her behind an elm i scouted the place and
satisfied myself there had been no recent
visitors there i called for her to join me
and proudly displayed an iron kettle i had
found by the door but when i would have
left her to make the kettle boil while i
looked for a turkey she refused to stay and
insisted on accompanying me

  fortunately i perched a turkey within
two hundred feet of the cabin i hung the
kettle in the fireplace and built a good fire
under it and then dressed the turkey for
some reason the girl preferred the open to
the cabin and remained outside the doori
as i finished my task she called to me
excitedly grabbing my rifle i ran out she
was pointing dramatically at a big blaze on
a mulberry-tree the scar was fresh and
a scout for virginia



on it some one had written with a charred
stick

  found some people killed here we are gone
down this way	douglass

  what does it mean she whispered her
eyes very big as she stared at the dusky
forest wall

 that would be james douglass i
mused he came down here with floyds
surveying-party last spring i wonder who
was killed

  enough to know the indians have been
here she said drawing closer to me
cant we go the way they did and be safe
we might make it but gone down this
way means they started for new orleans
a longroundabout journey to williamsburg 
oh never that i didnt understand
she cried i will be braver but if the
nearest way home was by the ohio i would
go by land anything but the river re-
member your promise that we are rjot to be
taken alive now lets push on

  and leave this excellent shelter i pro-
tested

  men have been killed here i cant
abide it a few miles more-please

  of course she had her own way but i
made her wait until we had cooked some
com to a mush and i had broiled the turkey
i could have told her it would be difficult
for us to select any spot along the river
which had not been the scene of a killing
so we took the kettle and left a stout snug
cabin and pushed on through the darkness
to the top of a low ridge where i insisted
we must camp we made no fire

  i estimated the days travel to have been
twelve miles at the least which was a good
stint for a man let alone a girl unused to
the forest nor had the work wearied her
unduly at least she had gained something
from her captivity-a strength to endure
physical hardships which she had never
known before with good luck and half-
way decent footing i believed another sun-
set would find us at the big sandy that
night was cold and i sorely regretted our
lack of blankets

before sunrise i had a fire burn-
ing and the kettle of mush slung on
a green sapling for further cooking
patricia was curled up like a kitten and i
recovered my hunting-shirt and slipped it
on without her knowing i had loaned it to
her for a covering she opened her eyes and

watched me a few moments without com-
prehending where she was with a little
cry she jumped to her feet and roundly
upbraided me for not calling her to hip
in the work

  i pointed out a spring and by the time
she was ready to eat the hot mush and cold
turkey the fire was out and we were ready
to march our lack of salt was all that
prevented the meal from being very appetiz-
ing we were not inclined to quarrel with
our good fortune however but ate enough to
last us the day as the first rays touched
the tops of the trees we resumed the journey

  we covered a good ten miles when we
had our first serious mishap since leaving
the indian village patricia had insisted
she be allowed to take the lead where the
blazed trees made the trace easy to follow
i humored her for she kept within a rod of
me we struck into a bottom and had to
pick our way through a stretch of cane

  afraid she might stumble on to a bear and
be sadly frightened i called on her to wait
for me but she discovered a blaze on a
sycamore beyond the cane and hurried for-
ward half-way through the cane she
slipped on a wet root and fell on her side
ordinarily the accident would not have been
serious but the moment i saw the expres-
sion of pain driving her face white i knew
she was hurt i dropped the kettle and
picked her up she winced and groaned
and said it was her arm i carried her to
the high ground and made her sit while i
examined her hurt i expected to find the
bone broken i was happily disappointed
and yet she was hurt grievously enough
a section of cane had penetrated the upper
arm near the shoulder making a nasty
wound as the cane had broken off in the
flesh it was necessary for me to play the
surgeon using a pair of bullet-molds i
managed to secure a grip on the ugly splinter
and pull it out she gave a little yelp but
did not move

  the worst is over i told her now
we must dress it

  returning and securing the kettle i
dipped water from a spring and lighted a
fire and hung the kettle to boil then i
hunted for indian medicine i soon found
it the bark of a linn or bee-tree root this
i pounded and bruised with the butt of
my rifle and threw it into the kettle to boil
patricia remained very patient and quiet
her eyes following my every move


adventure

  youre as useful as a housewife basdel
she remarked more useful than most
women could be

  only a trick learned from the environ-
ment i lightly replied dots it hurt
much this was rhetorical for i knew a
stab wound from the cane smarted and
ached most disagreeably

  not much she bravely replied im
sorry to bother you though

  youll soon be as fit as a fiddle i
assured her border men are continually
helping each other in this fashion

  as soon as the kettle boiled i washed the
wound in the liquid and made sure all of
the cane had been removed this additional
probing caused her pain but she showed no
signs not even by flinching the applica-
tion at once had a soothing effect we
waited until the medicine had cooked down
to a jelly-like consistency when i applied
it as a salve working it into and thoroughly
covering uie wound then i tied it up
with a strip tom from her skirt rather
rough surgery but i knew it would be
effective

  she bitterly lamented over the time we
were losing and blamed herself so severely
that i finally consented to go on providing
she would keep behind me had the hurt
been in her foot we would have been forced
to camp for several days

  toward night the country grew more
broken and much rougher and i knew we
were nearing the sandy i feared she might
trip over some obstacle and we camped
before the light deserted us i told her we
were within a few miles of the river and that
we ought to strike it at the mouth of savage
creek some four or five miles from the
ohio after starting a fire she volunteered
to remain and feed it while i looked for
game this in the way of doing penance
perhaps i had the good luck to shoot a
deer and we dined on venison

  after we had eaten she sat close by the
fire and was silent for many minutes that
she was meditating deeply was shown by
her indifference to the night sounds which
usually perturbed her the howling of the
wolves and the scream of a panther leaping
to make a kill passed unheard suddenly
she declared-

  you were right basdel

  about what patsy

  about my not fitting in west of the
mountains

  that was said before you were tried
no woman even border-born could be
more brave than you have been

  and i was so wofully wrong when i
made fun of your long rifle i want you to
forgive me

patsy dont you are wonderful
still being good to me basdel but i
know the truth now back over the moun-
tains i was wicked enough to feel a little
superior to frontier folks no dont wave
your hands at me i must say it i even
felt a little bit of contempt for those brave
women who went barefooted god forgive
me i was a cat basdel a vicious cat
good heavens patsy say it all and
have done with it call yourself a pirate
she would not respond to my banter but
fell to staring into the handful of coals
then the tears began streaming down her
face and at last she sobbed

  poor girl poor girl she was a won-
derful friend to me she never had any
chance and you can never know how hard
she tried to keep my spirits up how ready
she was to stand between me and harm-
me who has had every chance and to end
like that and yet it was far worse to five
like that its best as it is but god must
be very good to her to make up for what
she lost tell me basdel did she suffer
much when she died

  she could be talking only of cousins
sister i declared

  she suffered none its best for her as
it is

  she fell asleep with her back against a
black walnut and i spread my hunting-
shirt over her for the air was shrewdly cool
in the dying coals i saw pictures wherein
kirst dale and lost sister paraded in turn
the fate of each the result of race-hatred
and a race-avidity to possess the land and
a great fear came over me that the girl
leaning against the walnut the mass of
blue-black hair seeming to bow down the
proud head was destined to be added to the
purchase-price the frontier was ever paying

  it was her talk and tears that induced
this mood for i knew the shawnees would
have overtaken us by this time had they
found our trail on the kentucky shore
common sense told me that for the re-
mainder of our journey we would at worst
be compelled to avoid small scouting-parties
that had no intimation of our presence on
the big sandy
a scout for virginia



  but so many gruesome pranks had been
played by fate that i was growing super-
stitious and i feared lest the girl should
be snatched from me at the last moment
just as safety was almost within sight i
slept poorly that night and what little rest
i did obtain was along toward morning

      the girl awoke me and i felt my
wk face burning as i beheld her standing
there staring down accusingly the
lunting-shirt spread across my chest i
sprang to my feet and slipped into the shirt
which was made like a coat and waited for
her to speak

  so youve been sleeping cold she said
nay very warm i replied becoming
busy with my moccasins

  after this i will keep awake nights

  i did not need it i always take it off
at night it makes me too warm

  you he most beautifully basdel

  how is the arm this morning

  much better but you must be more
honest with me you must not lie any
more

  youre making a mountain out of a
hunting-shirt it is too warm to wear at
night in this mild weather

  youre hopeless of course it is not too
warm in the warm sunshine

  i was glad to let it go at that and there
was no warm sunshine this morning the
heavens were overcast with gray cold clouds
that rode high and brought wind rather
than rain we missed the sun town-
dwellers can never know the degree of de-
pendence the forest wanderer places on the
sunlight for his comfort and good cheer
despair becomes gaiety under the genial
rays it is not surprizing the sun should be
the greatest of all mysteries to the indians
and therefore their greatest medicine or
god

 we ate of the venison and mush and
started for the river the distance was not
great but the way was very rough and
there were no more blazed trees to guide
us the surveyors trace passing below us
and closer to the shore but i was familiar
with the lay of the land and it was impos-
sible for me to go far wrong so long as all
streams flowed into the ohio and were
crossed at right angles with their general
course

  i carried the kettle slung on my rifle and
with my right hand gave the girl aid when

the path became unusually difficult a
wrenched ankle would leave us as helpless
as a broken leg it required three hours of
painful efforts to bring us to the sandy

  i found a fording and carried her across
to the east shore and soon located a traders
trace she never dreamed that her father
often had traveled along this faint path in
his visits to the ohio indians now that
the footing was easier she had time to gaze
about and the aspect depressed her

  the immense hills of sandrock were worn
into deep and gloomy ravines by the streams

in the walls of the ravines black holes
gaped for caves were almost as numerous
as springs to encourage a lighter mood i
explained that these very caves made the
country an ideal place for hiding from the
indians

  she broke into my talk by moaning

  may the good god help us see that

  she was pointing to a dark opening across
the river this framed the face of the devil
for a moment i was sadly startled then
laughed hysterically in relief

  its a bear with a white or gray marking
on his face i explained he is harmless
see hes finished looking us over and goes
back into his den

  but the effect of the shock to her nerves
did not wear off for some time to prepare
her against more glimpses of bruin i told
her how the broken nature of the country
made it a favorite region for bears and that
it had been long known along the border
as a famous hunting-ground for the big
creatures

  i feel just as if it was the guardian spirit 
of an evil place that it is spying on us and
plotting to harm us she confessed

  whenever the trace permitted i swung
aside from the river and took to the ridges
the tops of these were covered with chest-
nuts and their sides with oaks more than
once on such detours i sighted furtive furry
forms slipping away from their feast on the
fallen nuts but patricias gaze was not suf-
ficiently trained to detect them and she
wandered through the groves without know-
ing we were literally surrounded by bears

  while a wild country it was relieved by
many beautiful touches such were the
tulip-trees or yellow poplar many f them
towered a hundred feet with scarcely a limb
to mar the wand-like symmetry of the
six-foot boles scarcely less inspiring were
the cucumber-trees or mountain magnolias


adventure

which here reached the perfection of growth

  scattered among these tall ones were
white and yellow oaks and they would be
considered giants if standing alone these
were the serene gods of the forest and they
had a quieting influence on my companion
it was with regret that i led her back along
the rough shore of the river

  i shot a young bear but patricia dis-
played a foolish repugnance and would eat
none of it later in the day i killed a deer
with such a minute charge of powder as to
emphatically establish my excellence as a
marksman for that one shot at least we
were nearly three days in making the tug
fork of the sandy

the girl bore the hardships well
the wound on her arm healed rapid-
ly and whatever she actually suf-
fered was mental rather than physical our
kettle proved second only to my rifle in
importance and if the fare lacked the savor
of salt our appetites made up for the deficit
when we reached the tug we were in the
region celebrated for colonel andrew lewis
sandy creek voyage of fifty-six as it
was styled with grim facetiousness

  it was one instance when colonel lewis
failed of carrying out an enterprise against
the indians it was a retaliatory raid
against the shawnees and his force was com-
posed of whites and cherokees and his lack
of success was due largely to the inefficiency
of the guides who undertook to pilot him
to the mouth of the sandy i told the girl
of the expedition as it was lacking in horrible
details and with other carefully selected
narratives tried to keep her from brood-
ing

  she seldom mentioned her father and
when she did it was usually connected with
some phase of life over the mountains i
believe that she was so thankful to know
he escaped the torture that his death lost
much of poignancy only once did she
revert to his taking off and then to ask-

  was there a single chance for him to
escape and i emphatically declared he
never had the ghost of a chance from the
moment he fell into black hoofs hands

  another ruse to keep her mind engaged
was to trace out our course with a stick on a
patch of bare earth i showed how we
should travel to the north fork of the sandy
and then strike to the head of bluestone
and follow it nearly to the mouth before

leaving it to cross new river then a short
journey to the greenbriar and howards
creek

  had i had any choice i should have pre-
ferred to take her over the mountains to
salem but my time was not my own and it
was imperative that i leave her at the first
place of safety and be about governor dun-
mores business my decision to make
howards creek was strengthened by an
adventure which befell us near the end of
our first day on the tug we were casting
about for a place to camp when we came
upon five indians three squaws and two
hunters

  patricia was greatly frightened on be-
holding them and it was some time before
i could make her understand that they were
friendly delawares accompanied by their
women and not painted nor equipped for
war after calming her i addressed them
and learned they were from white eyes
village they were afraid to go near the
settlements

  many long knives as they called the
virginia militia were flocking to the great
levels of the greenbriar and a forward
movement of a whole army was shortly to
be expected as the presence of a large
force of our riflemen so near howards creek
would insure the safety of that settlement
i knew it to be the proper ending of our
journey

  i induced patricia to remain in camp
with the indians while i went out and shot
a bear the bear was very fat and i gave
all the meat to the natives for which they
were very grateful one of them had a
smooth-bore but no powder i could spare
him none

  patricia was now convinced the indians
would not harm us but she would not con-
sent to making camp near them we walked
several more miles before she was willing
to stop and cook the kettle

my tally-stick gave the thir-
teenth of september as the date of
our arrival at howards creek the
settlers informed me i had lost a day some-
where on the long journey and that it was
the fourteenth nearly all the young and
unmarried men were off to fight in colonel
lewis army and many of the heads of
families including davis and moulton

  those who were left behind gave us a
royal welcome uncle dick the aged one
a scout for virginia



fell to sharpening his long knife with re-
newed vigor patricia and i had been
counted as dead dales death had been
reported by young cousin and it caused
no great amount of sorrow the girl was
never allowed to suspect this indifference
in reply to my eager inquiries i was told
that shelby cousin was at the great levels
serving as a scout

  for once howards creek felt safe with
nothing to worry about the men and women
became garrulous as crows the children
played lewis army from sunrise to sun-
set the widow mccabe swore she would
put on a hunting-shirt and breeches and go
to war the passing of men between the
levels and the creek resulted in some news
and many rumors the meeting-place at
the levels was called camp union colonel
lewis pursuant to orders from governor
dunmore had commenced assembling the
augusta botetourt and fincastle county
troops at the levels on august twenty-
seven cornstalks spies had served him
well

  his lordship was to lead an army raised
from the northwest counties and from the
vicinity of fort pitt down the ohio and
unite with colonel lewis at the mouth of
the great kanawha colonel charles
lewis with some augusta and botetourt
troops had left camp union on september
sixth to drive the cattle and four hundred
pack-animals to the mouth of the elk where
he was to make canoes for transporting
provisions to the ohio

  the main army had marched from camp
union on the twelfth although colonel
lewis had received a letter from dunmore
urging that the rendezvous be changed to
the mouth of the little kanawha colonel
lewis had replied it was impossible to alter
his line of march

  from a fellow sent out to round up stray
bullocks i learned the army would avoid
the deep gorge and falls in the river by
marching ten miles inland and parallel to
the east bank joining colonel charles lewis
at the elk

  by another man i was told how the
militiamen were given to shooting away
their precious ammunition and how the
colonel had warned that unless the practise
ceased no more powder would be given out
that the indians were active and not afraid
of the troops was evidenced by an attack
on stewarts fort only four miles from

camp union and this before the troops
marched

  colonel william christian was in com-
mand of the rear-guard and his men were
much disgruntled at the thought of not
being in the forefront of the fighting what
was most significant to me although only
an incident in the estimation of the men left
at howards creek was the attack made by
two indians on two of lewis scouts clay
and coward by name

  the scouts had separated and one of the
indians fired on and killed clay thinking
him to be alone the indians ran to get his
scalp and coward at a distance of a hun-
dred yards shot him dead coward then ran
back toward the line of march and the
surviving indian fled down the great
kanawha to inform the shawnee towns
that the long knives were coming

  i lost no time in securing a horse and a
supply of powder and in hurrying to say
good-by to patricia she was very sober
when i told her i was off to overtake the
army placing both hands on my shoulders
she said

  basdel i know youve forgiven all the
disagreeable things iye said to you i will
wait here until i hear from you i will pray
that you have an equal chance with the
other brave men

  i will come back and take you over the
mountains

  if you will only come back you may take
me where you will dear lad even if it be
deeper into the wilderness she softly
promised

  and mrs davis bustled out of the cabin
and energetically shooed the curious young-
sters away

  and now i was riding away to battle
riding right joyously over the chestnut
ridges and through the thick laurel through
stretches of pawpaw beech and flowering
poplar with the pea-vine and buffalo grass
soft underfoot and my heart was as
blithe as the mocking-birds and there was
no shadow of tomahawk or scalping-knife
across my path

  i knew the destiny of the border was soon
to be settled that it hinged on the lean
leather-faced riflemen ahead but there was
nothing but sunshine and glory for me in
that september day as i hastened to over-
take the grim-faced man who believed his
lordship john murray fourth earl of dun-
more viscount fincastle baron of blair

chapter xii

the shadows vanish

t followed the river the cord of the
bow and made good time where the
army would have had difficulty to get
through a dozen miles below the falls
and near the mouth of kellys creek where
walter kelly was killed by the indians
early in august  came upon a scout named
nooney we were on the west bank and
the river was two hundred yards wide
at that point nooney begged some to-
bacco and pointed out a fording-place and
gave me the parole this very fittingly
was kanawha he said i would speedily
make the camp and that colonel lewis
was with the first troops

   i lost no time in crossing and had barely
cleared the river-bank before i was held
up by an outpost this fellow knew noth-
ing of military red-tape he was plain
militia a good man in a fight but inclined
to resent discipline he grinned affably as
i broke through the woods and lowered
his rifle

  gimme some tobacker he demanded
good-naturedly

  i supposed youd want the parole
i replied fishing out a twist of virginia
leaf

  - i got that its kanawha

what i want is tobacker dont hurry
les talk im lonesome as one bug all
alone in a buffler robe see any footin
over cross im gittin tired o this out-
post business all foolishness well know
when we strike th red devils no need o
havin some one tell us your hoss looks
sorter peaked spose well have a mess of
a fight soon we boys come along to fight
not to stand like stockade-timbers out here
 alone

  i told him i had important news for
colonel i ewis and must not tarry he took
it rather ill because i would not tell him
my news then tried to make me promise
i would come back and impart it i equivo-
cated and led my horse on toward the camp
concealed from view of the river-bank by a
ribbon of woods the first man i met was
davis and the honest fellow was so rejoiced
to see me that he dropped his gun and took

                  

both my hands and stood there with his
mouth working but unable to say a word
big tears streamed down his face

  i hurriedly related my adventures and
his joy was trebled when he heard that
patricia was safe at howards creek

  shelby cousin shot and kilt dale he
told us bout that ericus thought he
knew it all wal them that lives longest
larns th most he philosophically ob-
served powerful glad to see you well
be seein more of each other i take it
hows my woman good shes a right
forward capable woman if i do say it
moultons out on a scout silent sort of a
cuss these days from thinkin bout his
woman an th children but a rare hand
in a mess

  and cousin

  say morris that feller acts like he was
reglar happy laughs a lot only it dont
sound natral hes a hellion at scoutin
poor baby kirst i must low its best
for him to be wiped out but its too bad he
couldnt a made his last fight along with
us theres th colonel in his shirt sleeves
smokin his pipe

  i passed on to where lewis was sitting
on a log it was fearfully hot as the high
hills on each side of the river shut out the
free air and made the camp an oven on
recognizing me the colonels eyes flickered
with surprize as the report of my capture
had spread far he rose and took my hand
and quietly said

  i knew they couldnt hold you unless
they killed you on the spot what about
miss dale

  i informed him of her safety and his face
lighted wonderfully

  thats good he softly exclaimed a
beautiful young woman the kind that
virginia is always proud of ericus dale
was lucky to die without being tortured
now for your news for you must be bring-
ing some

  i told him of the mighty gathering at
chillicothe and of the influx of the fierce
ottawas lost sisters warning to me to
keep clear of the great kanawha impressed
him deeply it convinced him i think that
the astute cornstalk had planned to attack
the army before it could cross the ohio and
that the shawnees on learning of the as-
sembling at the levels knew the advance
must be down the kanawha the indian
who escaped after clay was killed was back
a scout for virginia



on the scioto by this time after musing
over it for a bit he insisted that it did not
necessarily follow the attack would be in
force

  that was cornstalks first plan but
now he knows governor dunmore has an
army at the mouth of the little kanawha
he may chose to attack him instead of me
i hope not but theres a strong chance hell
do that while making a feint to fool me and
then float down the river and give me a real
battle

  he kindly offered to attach me to one of
the companies as sergeant with the pos-
sibility of appointing me an ensign but i
preferred to act as scout and enjoy more in-
dependence of action

  thats the - of it he remarked

all these fellows want to be scouts and
range the woods free of discipline they
want to whip the indians but they want
to do it their own way they persist in
wasting ammunition and it now looks as
if we would go into battle with less than one-
fourth of a pound ofpowder per man

  if any man speaks up and says he is the
best marksman in virginia then every man
withinuhearing challenges him to prove it
and theyll step one side and have a shoot-
ing-match even if they know cornstalks
army is within a couple of miles of us
theyre used to bear and deer-meat
they dont want to eat bullock-meat ill
admit the beef is a bit tough and every
morning some of then break the rules by
stealing out early to kill game this not
only wastes powder but it keeps the out-
posts alarmed

  before i was dismissed i asked about
cousin the colonels face became ani-
mated

  oh the young man with the sad history
hes out on a scout that fellow is ab-
solutely fearless i am surprized every
time he lives to return to make a report
its useless to lay down a route for him to
scout he prowls where he will but hes
valuable and we let him have his own way

  on the next day we marched to the mouth
of the elk where colonel charles lewis
was completing arrangements for trans-
porting the supplies down the river while
at that camp i went on my first scout and
found indian tracks one set of them
measured fourteen inches in length the
men went and looked at the signs before
they would accept my measurements

  the camp was extremely busy for we all
knew the crisis was drawing close our
armorer worked early and late unbreeching
the guns having wet charges three bri-
gades of horses were sent back to camp
union for more flour i went with mooney
on a scout up coal river and we found
indian signs four miles from the camp
other scouts were sent down the kanawha
and up the elk

  on returning i found cousin impatiently
waiting for me to come in he had
changed and his bearing puzzled me he
was given to laughing loudly at the horse-
play of the men yet his eyes never laughed
i took him outside the camp and without
any circumlocution related the facts con-
cerning his sister and kirst

  tell me again that part bout how she
died he quietly requested when i had
finished i did so he commented

  for killing that redskin i owe you
moren i would if youd saved my life a
thousand times so little sister is dead
no not that now that woman is dead i
have my little sister back again i took
on with this army sos i could reach the
scioto towns to think that kirst got
way up there i low he had a mans fight
to die in thats the way morris im
obleeged to you ill always remember her
words bout sendin a little sister to me
now ive got two of em we wont talk
no more bout it

  with that he turned and hurried into the
woods

the men continued firing their
guns without having obtained per-
mission and colonel lewis was
thoroughly aroused to stop the practise
he directed that his orders of the fifteenth
be read at the head of each company with
orders for the captains to inspect their
mens stock of ammunition and report
those lacking powder this reduced the
waste but there was no stopping the rifle-
men from popping away at bear or deer
once they were out of sight of their offi-
cers

  i had hoped cousin would return and be
my companion on the next scout but as he
failed to show up i set off with mooney for
a second trip up the coal this time we
discovered signs of fifteen indians making
toward the kanawha below the camp
we returned with the news and found a


adventure

wave of drunkenness had swept the camp
during our absence

  the sutlers were ordered to bring no
more liquor into camp and to sell from the
supply on hand only on a captains written
order this served to sober the offenders
speedily the scouts sent down the kana-
wha returned and reported two fires and
five indians within fifteen miles of the ohio
it was plain that the indians were dogging
our steps day and night and the men were
warned not to straggle

  we were at the elk camp from the
twenty-fourth to the thirtieth and on the
latter date the canoemen loaded their
craft and the pack-horse men and bullock-
drivers drew two days rations and started
down-river it rained for three days and
on october second we were camped neix
the mouth of the coal it was there that
cousin appeared a mingo scalp hanging
at his belt he informed colonel lewis
he had been to the mouth of the river
making the down-trip in a canoe and that
as yet no indians had crossed except small
bands of scouts

  breaking camp we encountered rich
bottom-lands difficult to traverse because
of the rain every mile or two there were
muddy creeks and the pack-horses were
nearly worn out several desertions were
now reported from the troops a hos-
tility to discipline rather than cowardice
being the incentive another trouble was
the theft of supplies

  as we advanced down the river signs of
small bands of indians became numerous
scarcely a scout returned without reporting
some i saw nothing of cousin until the
sixth of october and as we were finishing
an eight-mile march through long defiles
and across small runs and were entering
the bottom which extends for four miles
to the ohio the first that i knew he was
with us when he walked at my side and
greeted-

  theres goin to be a screamin big
fight

  he offered no explanation of his absence
and i asked him nothing it had required
five weeks to march eleven hundred men
one hundred and sixty miles and to convey
the necessary supplies the same distance

  as we scouts in the lead entered the bot-
tom cousin called my attention to the high-
water marks on the trees some of these
measured ten feet the point itself is

high from it we had a wide view of the
ohio and kanawha up and down-stream
it was cousin who discovered a writing
made fast to a tree calling attention to a
paper concealed in the hollow at the base of
the tree we fished it out and found it
was addressed to colonel lewis cousin
and i took it to him before opening it he
gave cousin a shrewd glance and remarked

  i am glad to see you back young man

  if ive read the signs right i low im
glad to git back was the grave reply

  the letter was from governor dunmore
and he wrote to complain because our
colonel had not joined him at the little
kanawha he now informed our comman-
der he had dropped down to the mouth of
the big hockhocking and we were expected
to join him there after frowning over the
communication colonel lewis read it aloud
to some of his officers and expressed himself
very forcefully it was soon camp gossip
and every man was free to discuss it

  much anger was expressed against gov-
ernor dunmore and ijlid seem absurd to
ask our army to move up the ohio some
sixty miles when such a tedious maneuver
would leave us farther from the indian
towns than we were while at the point
had the order been given for the army
to go to the hockhocking there would have
been many desertions

  i learned later that the letter was brought
to thp point by simon kenton and simon
girty who with michael cresap were
serving as scouts with dunmore while
the camp was busily criticizing the governor
our scouts from the elk came in and re-
ported seeing indians hunting buffalo
when within six miles of the point they
found a plowshare some surveying-in-
struments a shirt a light blue coat and a
human under jaw-bone	

  shelby cousin said the dead man was
thomas hogg who with two or three of
his men were reported killed by the indians
in the preceding april while making im-
provements cousin insisted his death had
been due to wild animals or an accident
after which the animals had dragged his
remains into the woods he argued that
an indian would never have left the coat
or the instruments

  we passed the seventh and eighth of the
month in making the camp sanitary and in
building a shelter for the supplies yet to
arrive down the river preparations also
a scout for virginia



went ahead for moving the army across the
ohio most of the scouts were sent out to
hunt up lost beeves while a sergeant and
squad were dispatched with canoes to the
elk after flour

  three men came in from the elk and
reported that colonel christian was camped
there with two hundred and twenty men
that he had only sixteen kettles and was
fearing his men would be ill from eating
too much roast meat without broth
on the eighth there arrived more letters
from governor punmore in which his lord-
ship expressed his surprize and annoyance
because of our failure to appear at the
hockhocking

  this time colonel lewis was quite open
in expressing his disgust at the governors
lack of strategy the kanawha was the
gate to augusta botetourt and fincastle
counties to leave it and move up-river
would leave the way open for the red army
to stream into virginia and work its sav-
agery while the colonials were cooped up
on the ohio or hunting indian wigwams in
the wilderness

  in the package was a letter to our colonel
from colonel adam stephens second in
command to his excellency which was
given wide publicity colonel stephens
reported very disagreeable news from bos-
ton it was to the effect that general
gage had fired on the people at cambridge
later we learned that while some gun-
powder and two cannon had been seized
by his majestys troops there had been
no massacre of the provincials but while
the rumor remained uncontradicted it
caused high excitement and great rage

on the evening of the ninth
cousin and i were ordered out to
scout up the river beyond old
town creek our camp was near the junc-
tion of the kanawha and the ohio almost
at the tip of the point about a fourth of a
mile to the east is crooked creek a very
narrow stream at that season of the year
with banks steep and muddy it skirts the
base of some low hills and flows nearly
south in emptying into the kanawha
half-way between our camp and old town
creek which empties into the ohio is a
small stretch of marsh-land extending north
and south with high bottom-lands on each
side

  cousin and i planned to keep along the

ohio shore until a few miles above old town
creek when we would separate one return-
ing along our course to keep an eye on the
river the other circling to the east and
swinging back through the low hills drained
by crooked creek this double reconnais-
sance should reveal any spies

  the men were very anxious tofcross the
river and come in contact with the indians
they believed they would have the allied
tribes within their grasp once they reached
the scioto they were cheered by the
report that the army would cross on the
morrow one tall watauga boy boastfully
proclaimed that all the shawnees and
mingos beyond the ohio wouldnt make
moren a breakfast for us davis be-
cause a man of family and more conserva-
tive insisted it would be a pretty tough
chunk of a fight

   this was the optimistic spirit cousin and
i left behind us when we set out at sunset
cousin was in a new mood there was
a certain wild gaiety rather a ferocious
gaiety in his bearing his drawn face
had lost some of the hard lines and looked
almost boyish and his eyes were feverishly
alight he seemed possessed of supera-
bundant physical strength and in pure
muscular wantonness went out of his way
to leap the fallen timbers which uttered
the shore

   as darkness increased he ceased his wild
play and became the prince of scouts we
advanced most leisurely for we had all
night if we cared to stay out we halted
when abreast of the marsh-land and seated
ourselves on the banks of the ohio and
watched the starlight find a mirror in the
waters after a protracted silence he
abruptly asked-

   my sister said she was sendin me a new
sister you say

  those were her words

  i wish she could know tonight i aint
needin any new sister wish she could
know right now that shes always been my
sister when i reckoned id lost her i
was just mistook she was just gone away
for a little while she found a mighty
hard an rough trace to travel i low i
low the almighty will have to give her
many belts afofe he smooths out the path
in her mind i low itll take a heap o
presents to make up for the burrs an
briars an sharp stones she had to foot it
over thank god she died white


adventure

   amen to that

   after another silence he asked-

   you low shes with daddy an mammy
   i do	

   thats mighty comfortin to figger on
he slowly mused much like a younker
gittin mighty tired an goin back home to
rest daddy an mammy will do a heap to
make it up to her forwhat she had to go
through yes i can count on em even
if the almighty happened to be too busy to
notice her when she first crossed the border
dear lad he meant no irreverence

   the night was calm and sounds carried
easily we had passed beyond where we
could hear the men singing and merry-
making in camp but the uneasy movements
of a turkey and the stealthy retreat of a deer
seemed very close at hand the soft pad-
pad of a woods cat approached within a few
feet before the creature caught the scent
and the retreat was marked by a series of
crashings through the undergrowth

   after a while we rose and continued up
the river

  no injuns along here murmured
cousin

   we reached old town creek and crossed
it without discovering any signs of the ene-
my nor were we looking for anything more
serious than a stray scout or two we
went nearly two miles above the creek and
turned back after deciding we would sepa-
rate at the creek he taking the hills route
and i following the river we reached the
creek and he was about to leave me when
we both heard a new note a splashing noise
very faint our hands met in a mutual
desire to grab an arm and enforce attention
no fish made it i whispered

   no fish he agreed there

   the splashing came from across the sev-
eral hundred yards of the ohios deep and
silent current it was repeated until it
became almost continuous and it gradually
grew louder

   rafts shrilly whispered cousin

   they are paddling fast

  no but there are many rafts he
corrected

   we retreated up-stream a short distance
and concealed ourselves in a deep growth
to the sound of poles and paddles was added
the murmuring of guttural voices then
for a climax a raft struck against the bank
 and a low voice speaking shawnee gave
i some sharp orders

  one counted cousin

  as he spoke another raft took the shore
and then they grounded so rapidly that it
was impossible to count them orders
were given and the indians worked back
from the river and proceeded to make a
night-camp the landing had been made
at the mouth of the creek but the savages
had spread out and some of them were
due east from us

  theres a heap of em whispered
cousin lucky for us they didnt fetch
any dawgs along or wed be smelled out
an have to leg it

  i hear squaws talking

  kiss the devil if you dont theres
boys voices too theyve fetched their
squaws an boys along to knock the wounded
an dyin in the head

  then that means they feel sure of win-
ning

  and my heart began thumping until i
feared its beating would be audible at a
distance and before my inner gaze ap-
peared a picture of lewis army defeated
and many victims being given over to the
stake

  keep shet cautioned cousin there
it is again a mingo talkin a seneca id
say-hear that jabber delaware-wy-
andot-taway ottawa with a blanket
o shawnee pow-wow by heavens morris
this is cornstalks whole force theyve
larned that dunmore is at the hockhockin
an will be jinin up with lewis any day
an old cornstalk thinks to lick lewis afore
dunmores men can git along

it was now after midnight and i
knew we should be back at camp
and warning colonel lewis of his
peril i knew from my last talk with him
that he did  expect to meet the indians
in any numbers uhtil we had crossed the
ohio our failure to find any indians at
the point and our prospects for an immedi-
ate crossing conduced to this belief

  the day before all the scouts had been
instructed as to our maneuvers once we
crossed the river and were searching for
ambushes it was terrible to think of our
army asleep only three miles away i
urged an immediate return but cousin
coolly refused to go until he had reconnoit-
ered further

  you stay here till ive sneaked down
to the mouth o the creek he whispered
a scout for virginia



 twont do for both of us to git killed an
leave no one to take the word to lewis
but why run any risk i anxiously de-
manded for i feared he had some mad
prank in mind which would betray our
presence and perhaps stop our warning to
the army

  we must larn somethin as to how many
o the red skunks there be he replied

  to venture near their camp will mean
discovery theyre very wide-awake

  i aint goin near their camp he growled
in irritation i want to look over them
rafts i can tell from them how many war-
riors come over or pretty close to it

  he slipped away and left me to do the
hardest of the work-the work of waiting
it seemed a very long time before i heard
the bushes rustle i drew my ax but a
voice whispering richmond the parole
for the night composed me feeling his
way to my side he gravely informed me
theres seventy-eight or nine rafts an
a few canoes its goin to be a fine piece
o fightin at least theres a thousand war-
riors on this side an a lot o squaws an
boys i estimated our army at eleven
hundred and i thanked god they were all
frontiersmen

  cousin now was as eager to go as i
and leaving our hiding-place we worked
north until we felt safe to make a detour to
the east our progress was slow as there
was no knowing how far the indian scouts
were ranging once we were forced to re-
main flat on our stomachs while a group of
warriors passed within a dozen feet of us
driving to their camp some strayed beeves
from the high rolling bottom-lands to the
east when the last of them had passed
i observed with great alarm a thinning out
of the darkness along the eastern sky-line

  good god well be too late i
groaned lets fire our guns and give the
alarm

  not yet snarled my companion i
must be in the thick o that fight were
too far east to git to camp in a hustle we
must sneak atween the hills an that small
slash virginian for marsh foller me
we changed our course so as to avoid the
low hills drained by crooked creek and
made after the warriors about an hour
before sunrise we were at the head of the
marsh and in time to witness the first act
of the days great drama two men were
working out of the fallen timber and cou-

sin threw up his double-barrel rifle i
checked him saying-

  dont theyre white

  renegades

  john seviers younger brother valen-
tine tother is jim robertson

  then lewis knows he sent em to
scout the camp

  theyre after game james shelby is
sick with the fever yesterday morning he
asked them to perch a turkey for him
signal them they know nothing about
the indians

  cousin risked discovery by standing clear
of the bushes and waving his hat there
comes two more of em he exclaimed

  this couple was some distance behind
the watauga boys but i recognized them
one was james mooney my companion
on the coal river scout the other was
joseph hughey

  i jumped out and stood beside cousin
and waved my arms frantically one of
them caught the motion and said something
the four paused and stared at us we
made emphatic gestures for them to fall
back at first they were slow to under-
stand thinking as sevier told me after-
ward that i was pointing out some game
then they turned to run robertson and
sevier firing their rifles to the woods to the
north of us

  these were the first guns fired in the battle
of point pleasant from the woods came
the noise of a large body of men advancing
a ripple of shots was sent after the hunters
hughey and mooney halted and returned
the fire a streak of red some distance
ahead of the shawnees position and close
to the river bank dropped hughey dead
this shot was fired by tavenor ross a
white man who was captured by the in-
dians when a boy and who had grown up
among them

  mooney robertson and young sevier
were now running for the camp passing
between the ohio bank and the marsh
we raced after them just as a man named
hickey ran from the bushes and joined
them the indians kept up a scattering
fire and they made much noise as they
spread out through the woods in battle-line
they supposed we were the scouts of an
advancing army

  it is the only instance i know of where
insubordination saved any army from a
surprize attack and possibly from defeat


adventure

to escape detection while breaking the
orders against foraging the five men named
had stolen from the camp at an early hour

  by the time cousin and i passed the lower
end of the marsh small bodies of indians
were making for the hills along crooked
creek others were following down the
ohio inside the timber while their scouts
raced recklessly after us to locate our line
of battle the scouts soon discovered
that our army was nowhere to be seen
runners were instantly sent back to in-
form cornstalk he was missing a golden
opportunity by not attacking at once

  mooney was the first to reach colonel
lewis who was seated on a log in his
shirt sleeves smoking his pipe mooney
shouted-

  moren four acres covered with injuns
at old town creek

  rising but with no show of haste lewis
called to cousin and me-

  what about this

  an attack in force sir i believe i
panted

  he glanced at cousin who nodded and
then ducked away

  i think you are mistaken the colonel
coldly remarked it must be a big scout-
ing-party i tried to tell him what cousin
and i had seen and heard but he ig-
nored me and ordered the drums to beat
to arms but already the border men
were turning out and diving behind logs
and rocks even while the sleep still blurred
their eyes

colonel lewis ordered two
columns of one hundred and fifty
men each to march forward and
test the strength of the enemy the col-
onels brother charles led the augusta line
to the right colonel william fleming
commanded the left-botetourt men the
two columns were about two hundred
yards apart and their brisk and business-
like advance did the heart good to be-
hold

  no one as yet except the hunters and
cousin and i realized the three hundred
men were being sent against the full force
of the ohio indians colonel lewis re-
sumed his seat on the log and continued
smoking

  youre nervous morris it cant be
more than a large scouting-party or theyd
have chased you in

  they came over on seventy-eight rafts
i replied turning to race after colonel
charles lewis column

  the augusta men were now swinging in
close to crooked creek where it skirts the
foot of the low hills as i drew abreast
of the head of the column we were fired
upon by a large force of indians now snugly
ensconced behind trees and fallen timber
along the creek we were then not more
than a quarter of a mile from camp the
first fire was tremendously heavy and was
quickly followed by a second and third vol-
ley the augusta men reeled but quickly
began returning the fire the behavior of
the men being all that a commander could
desire they were forced to give ground
however as the odds were heavy

  on our left crashed a volley as the
botetourt men were fired on colonel lew-
is ordered his men to take cover then turned
to captain benjamin harrison and
cried

  this is no scouting-party but my
brother will soon be sending reinforce-
ments

  he had hardly spoken before he spun
half-way around a surprized expression on
his face

  im wounded he quietly said

  then handing his rifle to a soldier he
called out to his men-

  go on and be brave

  with that he began walking to the camp
i ran to help him but he motioned me back
saying-

  your place is there im all right

  so i left him a very brave soldier and a
christian gentleman to make his way
alone while his very minutes were num-
bered

  half a dozen of our men were down and
the rest were slowly giving ground up to
the time colonel lewis left us i had seen
very few indians and only mere glimpses
at that now they began showing them-
selves as they crowded forward through the
timber confident they were to slaughter us
above the noise of the guns the yells and
shouts of red and white combatants rose
a deep booming voice that of cornstalk
and he was shouting

  be strong be strong push them into
the river

we dragged back our dead and wounded
as with a reckless rush the indians advanced
over logs and rocks up to the very muzzles
a scout for virginia

x

of our guns but although the augusta
line gave ground the men were not suffer-
ing from panic and the smashing volley
poured into the enemy did great damage
and checked their mad onslaught

  never before did red men make such a
determined charge in an instant there
were a score of individual combats back-
woodsman and savage being clinched in a
death-struggle with ax and knife now
our line stiffened and the very shock of
their attack seemed to hurl the indians
back still we would have been forced
back to the camp and must have suffered
cruel losses if not for the timely reinforce-
ments brought up on the run by colonel
john field veteran of braddocks and pon-
tiacs wars

  he led augusta and botetourt men for
it was no longer possible to keep the two
lines under their respective commanders
nor did any captain for the rest of the day
command his own company as a unit
with the coming up of colonel field the
indians immediately gave ground then
charged irst viciously as our men pur-
sued this maneuver was one of corn-
stalks cunning tactics the alternate ad-
vance and retreat somewhat confusing our
men

  the second attack was repulsed and the
riflemen slowly gained more ground the
firing on our left was now very heavy and
colonel field directed me to learn how the
fight there was progressing some of our
fellows were screaming that flemings
column was being driven in and our colonel
had no intention of being cut off

  as i started toward the river i could hear
cornstalk exhorting

  shoot straight lie close fight and
be strong

  as i withdrew from the right column i
had a chance to get a better idea of the
battle the indians lined the base of the
hills bordered by crooked creek and were
posted on all the heights to shoot any whites
trying to swim either the ohio or the kana-
wha on the opposite side of the ohio and
as i later learned onthe south bank of the
kanawha red forces had been stationed in
anticipation of our army being routed

  as i neared the botetourt men i could
hear between volleys the indians shouting
in unison-

  drive the white dogs over meaning
across the river

   

   the botetourt men were well posted and
 considerably in advance of the right column
 as they had given but little ground while
 the right was retiring after lewis was shot
 at no time did either column fight at a
 range of more than twenty yards and when
 i crawled among flemings men the range
 was not more than six yards while here and
 there in the deeper growth were hand-to-
 hand struggles

   a big chunk of a fight screamed a
shrill voice and cousin was beside me
wearing a brilliant scarlet jacket as he
was crawling by me i caught him by the
heel and dragged him back

   you fool take that coat off i yelled
 for the vivid splotch of color made hie a
 tempting target for every indian gun and
 the shawnees were skilful marksmen even
 if less rapid than the whites because of their
 inability to clean their fouled weapons

   cousin drew up his leg to kick free then
 smiled sweetly and said

   its my big day morris dont go for
 to meddle with my medicine everythings
 all right at last ive found the long trace
 that leads to my little sister shes waitin
 to put her hand in mine as she used to do
 on keeneys knob

   with that he suddenly jerked his leg free
 and sprang to his feet and streaked toward
 the savages his blood-curdling panther-
 screech penetrating the heavier vibrations
 of the battle

   he was lost to view in the brush and i
 had my work to do i kept along the edge
 of the timber and answered many anxious
 queries as to the fate of the right column

 i	reassured them but did not deea it wise
 to tell of colonel lewis wound i found
 the column quite close to the river and by
 the stubborn resistance it was meeting i
 knew the indians were strongly posted

   why dont you whistle now they kept
 howling in concert and referring to our
 fifes which were still

   well kill you all and then go and speak
 to your big chief dunmore was one of
 their promises

   and there were other things shouted
foul epithets which i am ashamed to admit
could only have been learned from the
whites and repeatedly did they encour-
age each other and seek to intimidate us
by yelling

   drive the white dogs over the river
 drive them like cattle into the water


adventure

while i kept well covered and was
completing my reconnaissance i was
hoitified to see colonel fleming
walk into the clear ground he fired at
an indian who had showed himself for a
moment to make an insulting gesture
he got his man and the next second was
struck by three balls two passing through
his left arm and the third penetrating his
left breast

  he called out to his captains by name
and sharply ordered them to hold their
ground while he went to the rear to be
patched up he was answered by hearty
cheers but his absence was to be keenly
felt by his officers he started to work his
way to the point but the exertion of bend-
ing and dodging from tree to stump sorely
taxed him i ran to his aid just as davis
of howards creek sprang from behind a
log and seized his right arm between us
we soon had him back in camp and his
shirt off the lung tissue had been forced
through the wound a fingers length he
asked me to put it back i attempted it
and failed whereat he did it himself with-
out any fuss

  on returning to the right column to make
a belated report to colonel field i ran
across the body of mooney my partner
on several scouts he had been shot
through the head it may here be said
that nearly all the dead on both sides were
shot through the head or chest indicating
the accuracy of marksmanship on both sides

  i found the augusta men steadily pushing
the indians back but when they gave
ground quickly as if in a panic it was to
tempt the foolhardy into rushing forward
the riflemen had learned their lesson how-
ever and maintained their alignment
the advance was through nettles and briers
up steep muddy banks and over fallen
timber

  the warriors rushed repeatedly to the
very muzzles of our guns and thus displayed
a brand of courage never surpassed if ever
equaled by the north american indian
before it was cornstalk who was holding
them to the bloody work his voice at
times sounded very close but although we
all knew his death would count a greater
coup than the scalps of a hundred braves
we never could get him he was too shrewd
and evasive

  once i believed i had him for i had
located him behind a detached mound of

fallen timber he was loudly calling out
for his men to be brave and to lie close
when a warrior leaped up and started to
run to the rear then cornstalk flashed
into view long enough to sink his ax into
the cowards head it was all done so
quickly that he dropped to cover unharmed

  that was one of his ways of enforcing
obedience a mode of terrorization never
before practised by a war-chief to my knowl-
edge it was told afterward by the shaw-
nees that he killed more than that weak-
hearted one during the long day i saw
nothing of the other chiefs who attended
the conference in cornstalks town while
i was a prisoner and yet they were there
chiefs of mingos wyandots delawares and
ottawas

  theyre failin back theyre failin
back yelled a voice in advance of our
first line

  and the scream of a panther told us it was
cousin he had worked across from the
left column and we were soon beholding
his bright jacket in a tangle of logs and
stumps

  the men advanced more rapidly but did
not break their line and it was evident
the savages were giving ground in earnest
our men renewed their cheering and their
lusty shouts were answered by the column
on the river-bank still in advance of us

  as it seemed we were about to rush the
enemy into a panic we received our second
heavy loss of the day colonel field was
shot dead he was standing behind a big
tree reserving his fire for an indian who had
been shouting filthy abuse at him poor
colonel it was but a ruse to hold his at-
tention while savages up the slope and be-
hind fallen timber drew a bead on him
captain evan shelby assumed command
and ordered the men to keep up the ad-
vance

  the indians gave ground but with no
signs of confusion observing our left
column was in advance of the right corn-
stalk was attempting to straighten his
line by pulling in his left as we pressed
on we discovered the savages were scalping
their own dead to prevent their hair falling
into our hands from the rear of the red
men came the sound of many tomahawks
cousin who for a moment found himself at
my side exulted

  curse em their squaws an boys are
cuttin saplins for to carry off their
a scout for virginia



wounded theyll need a heap o stretchers
afore this day is over

  the sun was now noon-high and the heat
was beastly the battle was at its climax
the left column was near a little pond and
about fifty yards from the river or a fourth
of a mile beyond the spot where lewis was
shot we had evened up this lead and the
battle-line extended from the river and pond
to crooked creek and half-way down the
creek running from west to east and then
southwest

  cornstalks plan was to coop us up in the
point and drive us into the kanawha and
ohio there were times when our whole
line gave ground but only to surge ahead
again thus we seesawed back and forth
along a mile and a quarter of battle-line
with the firing equal in intensity from wing
to wing nor had the indians lost any of
their high spirits their retreat was merely
a maneuver they kept shouting-

  well show you how to shoot

  why dont you come along

  why dont you whistle now

  youll have two thousand to fight to-
morrow

  but the force that held them together
and impelled them to make the greatest
fight the american indian ever put up not
even excepting the battle of bushy run
was cornstalk truly he was a great
man measured even by the white mans
standards

  be strong be brave lie close shoot
well flowed almost uninterruptedly from
his lips

  davis of howards creek went by me
making for the rear with a shattered right
arm and a ghastly hole through his cheek
he tried to grin on recognizing me word
was passed on from our rear that runners
had been sent to hurry up colonel christian
and his two hundred men among the
captains killed by this time were john
murray and samuel wilson it was a few
minutes after the noon hour that cousin
emerged from the smoke on my right and
howled-

  theres old puck-i-shin-wa

  he darted forward clearing all obstacles
with the ease of a deer i saw the shawnee
chief father of tecumseh snap his piece at
the boy then i saw him go down with
cousins lead through his painted head
two savages sprang up and cousin killed
one with his remaining barrel the other

fired pointblank and by the way cousin fell
i knew his object in wearing the scarlet
jacket was attained he had wished to
die this day in the midst of battle

  william white killed cousins slayer
the boy was in advance of the line and
his coat made him conspicuous doubtless
the savages believed him to be an important
officer because of it

  five of them rushed in to secure his
scalp and each fell dead and their bodies
concealed the boy from view up to one
oclock the fighting raged with undimin-
ished fury with never any cessation of their
taunts and epithets and cornstalks sten-
torian encouragement

  now it is never in indian nature to pro-
long a conflict once it is obvious they must
suffer heavy losses they consider it the
better wisdom to run away and await an
opportunity when the advantage will be
with them cornstalk had been confident
that his early morning attack would drive
us into the rivers thus affording his forces
on the opposite banks much sport in picking
us off

  but so fiercely contested had been the
battle that none of our dead had been
scalped except hughey and two or three
men who fell at the first fire by all that
we had learned of indian nature they
should now after six hours of continuous
fighting be eager to withdraw they had
fought the most bitterly contested battle
ever participated in by their race

  nor had they as in braddocks defeat
been aided by white men there were to
be true several white men among them
such as tavenor ross john ward and
george collet but these counted no more
than ordinary warriors and collet was killed
before the fighting was half over accord-
ing to all precedents the battle should have
ended in an indian rout by the time the siua
crossed the meridian instead the savages
stiffened their resistance and held their
line

  our men cheered from parched throats
when word was passed that collets body
had been found and identified poor devil
perhaps it opened the long trace to him
where everything would be made right
he was captured when a child and had re-
sponded to the only environment he had
ever known

  the case of such as collet-yes and of
john ward and ross-is entirely different


adventure

from that of timothy dorman and others
of his kind who was captured when a grown
man and who turned renegade to revenge
himself for wrongs real or fancied on his
old neighbors

rjksi it was not until after seven hours of
kji fighting that we detected any falling
 off in the enemys resistance even
then the savages had the advantage of an
excellent position and to press them was
extremely hazardous business we con-
tinued to crowd them however until they
were lined up on a long ridge which extended
from the small marsh where cousin and i
first saw robertson and sevier for half
a mile to the east where it was cut by the
narrow bed of crooked creek

  none of us needed to be told that so long
as the enemy held this ridge our camp at
the point was in grave danger from the
riflemen along the ohio word came that the
indians were throwing their dead into the
river while squaws and boys were dragging
back their wounded

  this had a heartening effect on us for it
indicated a doubt was creeping into the
minds of the savages once they permitted
the possibility of defeat to possess them
their effectiveness would decrease com-
pany commanders called on their men to
take the ridge but to keep their line intact

  with wild cheers the men responded and
buckled down to the grueling task every
patch of fallen timber proved to be an in-
dian fort where the bravest of the tribes
fought until they were killed it was stub-
born traveling but our riflemen were not to
be denied

  from along the line would come cries of
  remember tygarts valley
  remember carrs creek

  remember the clendennins

  and always cornstalks voice answered
  be strong be brave fight hard

  so we struggled up the slope gaining a
yard at a time and counting it a triumph
if we passed a pile of dead timber and
gained another a few feet beyond

  when we were most encouraged the in-
dians began mocking us and shouting
exultingly and informing us that the war-
riors across the kanawha and ohio had
attacked our camp and were massacring the
small force retained there this statement
repeatedly hurled at us with every sem-
blance of savage gloating tended to weaken

the mens one purpose we could cap-
ture the ridge-but behind our determi-
nation crawled the fear that we might be
assailed in the rear at any moment

  captain shelby was quick to realize the
depressing influence of this kind of talk and
shouted for the word to be passed that it
was an indian trick that our troops were
guarding the kanawha for half a mile up
the stream and that the warriors on the
indian shore could not cross over without
the column on our left discovering the move

 this prompted our common sense to
return to us and we remembered that
andrew lewis was too cool and shrewd
to be caught napping the point was
sprinkled with huge trees and it would take
a big force to clear it of our reserves and
the bulk of the enemy was before us on the
ridge

  with renewed vigor we made greater
exertions and at last reached the top of the
ridge and cleared it but even then the
indians were not defeated they charged
us with ferocious energy time after time
and the best we could do was to cling to our
position and let them bring the fighting to
us so different was their behavior from
any we had been familiar with in previous
engagements we began to wonder if they
would violate other indian precedents and
continue the battle into the night

  it was not until three or four oclock that
we noticed any lessening in their efforts to
retake the ridge at the best this afford-
ed us only a short breathing-spell there
were many warriors still hidden along the
slopes drained by crooked creek our
line was so long there was always danger of
the indians concentrating and breaking
it

  so long as we stuck to the ridge on the
defensive the enemy had the advantage of
the initiative a runner brought up word
from colonel lewis to learn the strength
of the savages in the hills along the creek
and i was directed to reconnoiter

ca i made for the creek from the
south slope of the ridge sliding
down the muddy bank i ascended
the opposite slope and began making my
way toward the point where the creek cut
through the ridge i encountered no in-
dians although axes and knives on the
ground showed where they had been
stationed before retiring
a scout for virginia



  i passed through the cut and was sud-
denly confronted by what i thought at
first must be the devil the fellow was
wearing the head of a buffalo horns and
tangled forelock and all through the
eye-slits gleamed living eyes the shock
of his grotesque appearance threw me off
my guard for a moment he leaped upon
me and we went down the bank into the
bed of the creek

  he had his ax ready to use but i caught
his hand his hideous mask proved to be
his undoing for as we rolled about it became
twisted i was quick to see my advantage
relying on one hand to hold his wrist i
used all my quickness and strength and
succeeded in turning the mask half-way
around leaving him blind and half-smoth-
ered i killed him with his own ax before
he could remove his cumbersome headgear

  as none of his companions had come to
his rescue i knew this marked their most
advanced position in the hills having
learned all i could without sacrificing my
life i began my retreat down the creek and
narrowly escaped being shot by one of our
own men

  captain shelby ordered me to report to
colonel lewis which i did running at top
speed without attempting to keep under
cover i found the reserves had thrown
up a breastwork from the ohio to the kana-
wha thus inclosing the camp on the point
it lacked half an hour of sunset when i
reached the camp

  colonel lewis heard me then ordered
captains isaac shelby arbuckle mat-
thews and stuart to lead their companies
up crooked creek under cover of the bank
until they could secure a position behind
the indians and enfilade their main line
i scouted ahead of this force we circled
the end of the indian line but were at once
discovered

  instead of this being our undoing it
proved to be all in our favor cornstalks
spies had kept him informed of colonel
christians presence a few miles from the
point he took it for granted that this
force in the hills behind his line was rein-
forcements brought up by christian and this
belief caused him to order a general retire-
ment across old town creek at that time
christian was fifteen miles from the point
sunset found us in full possession of the
battle-field

  leaving strong outposts we retired to the

well-protected camp rejoicing loudly and
boasting of more than two-score scalps
we carried off all our dead and wounded
the exact indian loss was never definitely
settled but it must have equaled if not
exceeded ours more than a score were
found in the woods covered deep with brush
and many were thrown into the river

  this battle ended dunmores war also
known as cresaps war and the shawnee
war so far as actual fighting and losses
are considered it was a drawn battle but
as cornstalk could not induce his men to
renew the conflict and inasmuch as they
retreated before morning to the indian
shore the victory must be held to be with
the backwoodsmen

  and yet the tribes were not entirely
downcast for during the early evening they
continued to taunt us and to repeat their
threats of bringing an army of two thousand
on to the field in the morning in fact
many of our men believed the savages had
a shade the best of the fight and would
renew hostilities in the morning

that night we buried shelby
cousin on the bank of the kanawha
and built a fire over his grave to
conceal it colonel christian arrived at
midnight and there was some lurid pro-
fanity when his men learned they had ar-
rived too late for the fighting one week
after the battle eleven hundred troops
crossed the ohio to carry the war to the
indian towns for a final decision

  when thirteen miles  south of chilli-
cothe the town governor dunmore had
ordered us to attack and destroy a message
arrived from his lordship directing colonel
lewis to halt his advance for peace was about
to be made hostile bands had fired upon
us that very morning and the position
was not suitable for a camp colonel
lewis continued the march for a few miles
another messenger arrived with orders
for us to halt for the peace was about to be
consummated

  we went into camp on congo creek
about five miles from chillicothe the
men raged something marvelous they
insisted that no decisive battle had been
fought and that we had thrown away nearly
a hundred lives if the fighting were not
renewed the shawnees were in our power
what folly to let them escape

  dunmore and white eyes the friendly


adventure

delaware chief rode into camp and con-
ferred with colonel lewis and as a result
we started the next day for point pleasant
and virginia the men were all but out of
bounds so furious were they at not being
lood at the shawnees

 then began the talk that dunmore
brought on the war to keep our backwoods-
men busy in event the colonies rebelled
against england also that he closed it
prematurely so that the indians might con-
tinue a menace to the border and thus keep
the frontier men at home

  i was as hot as any against his lordship
for the way the campaign ended we de-
manded blood for blood in those days and
never had the virginia riflemen a better
chance for inflicting lasting punishment on
their ancient foes and we were quick to
blame his lordship for a variety of unwhole-
some motives

  but with political rancor long since
buried we can survey that campaign more
calmly and realize that as a result of the
battle the northwest indians kept quiet
for the first two years of the revolution-
ary war arid that during this period ken-
tucky was settled and the vast continent
west of the alleghanies was saved to the
union

  if the battle of bushy run took the heart
out of the tribes confederated under
pontiacs masterly leadership then dun-
mores war permitted us to begin life as a
republic without having the alleghanies
for our western boundary nor can i hold
in these latter days that his lordship was
insincere in waging the war for england
was against it from the first

  i believe he pushed the war as vigor-
ously and shrewdly as he knew how and i
believe his was the better judgment in
securing the best peace-terms possible
instead of heaping defeat on defeat until the
allied tribes had nothing left to bargain for
so i give his lordship credit for making
a good bargain with the indians and a
bargain which aided the colonists during
the struggle almost upon them but i
was very happy when colonel andrew
lewis drove him from virginia

chapter xiii

peace comes to the clearing

early winter and the wind was crisp
and cold as i rode into howards
creek smoke rose from the cabins i
limped toward the davis cabin a strange
shyness holding me back some one inside
was singfeig

  ye daughters and sons of virginia incline
    your ears to a story of wo

  i sing of a time when your fathers and mine
    fought for us on the ohio

  in seventeen hundred and seventy-four

    the month of october we know

  an army of indians two thousand or more
    encamped on the ohio

  there was a whirl of linsey petticoats
behind me and two plump arms were about
my neck and her dear voice was sobbing
they didnt know i feared you were
dead beyond the ohio

  but i sent you a message i protested
patting her bowed head i sent word by
moulton that it was only an arrow-wound
in the leg and that i must wait

 and he never came nor brought your
word he stopped in tygarts valley and
sent his brother to bring mrs moulton and
the children one man said he heard you
had been hurt i wrote to colonel lewis but
he was not at richfield so i never knew
we walked aside and i petted her and
listened to her dear voice and forgot the
cold wind biting into my thin blood forgot
i would always walk with a slight limp
when we did awake because the early
dusk was filling the clearing the singer was
finishing his seventeen-stanza song-

as israel did mourn and her daughters did wcep
  for saul and his host on gilbow

well morn colonel field and the heroes who sleep
  on the banks of the ohio

  and i thought of shelby cousin and the
others who gave their lives that we might
meet thus without the war-whoop inter-
rupting our wooing and i wondered if our
childrens children would ever realize that
the deaths died at point pleasant made life
and happiness possible for them i prayed
it might be so for lonely graves are not so
lonely if they are not forgotten

in his prime

    ty-lpcerddniels

-i

the beginning was back in the days
when taking cargoes up and down
the great lakes was no childs
play donovan had reveled in it
coming down from duluth just a village
then a scattered place on the side of a hill
before winds that had sprung into being
not nearer than the rockies gaining
strength as they came tearing past less
skilful skippers getting bonus money for
record trips that was life

  then gradually had come the marvels
of ore-loading huge derricks and endltjss
streams of carriers that made time fly great
steel ore-boats that numbered hatches well
up in the twenties clumsy-looking whale-
backs that wallowed awash whenever the
wind cut capers the poe lock that made the
engineering-feat of the old one a mere step-
ping-stone to real achievement the cana-
dian lock that could put through a ship in
seven minutes all these had warned dono-
van of the changing order the days gained
were those in port running up and down
the lakes had become a scheduled thing
in these later years the record bonuses were
won by the loading and unloading crews

  donovan had turned to tugs the old
adventure still clung to the little fellows
theirs was still the catch-as-catch-can life
a grim fight for the survival of the fittest
in all this scheduled business of ore from
duluth and coal and what-not back-some-
times ballast-the tugs stood aloof fought
for tows vied in the skill of handling log-
rafts down the lakes

  from as far back as he could remember
from the time he had planned to have the

little house on the hill a friendly place
where a crony could yarn away the night
a place with a bit of garden in summer and
a well-stocked wood-pile in winter captain
donovan had dreamed of this day when he
would retire

  he had sensed something queer the day
before when mr warrington owner of the
tugboat company had asked him to come
down to the office in the morning every
day donovans tug the fannie l was at
the soo he reported to the company
office why in the world he should be re-
quested specially to come when they knew
he would come anyway was no small mys-
tery he had worried away the night over
it the first spirit of unrest in a whole un-
troubled life

  promptly at the designated hour dono-
van made his appearance at the companys
office

  we have decided to put you on the re-
tired list captain donovan warrington
had said it is high time you had the rest
you deserve young sparks will take over
the fannie l in the spring

  donovan might have been standing be-
fore a judge in black cap pronouncing the
death-sentence the word struck him numb
and cold somehow he managed to make
reply and had found his way out to the dock

  now he stood there bewildered to look
at him one might have judged he was a
modern atlas with the world on his shoul-
ders slowly he picked his way along the
dock all unmindful of salutations and after
the longest walk of his life came to the snug
little house on gore street on the top of the


adventure

hill that overlooks the town from where
one can see the lower reaches of superior or
the channel lose itself around sugar island
down-river

  it was his custom on reaching the sum-
mit to pause a moment and with his eye
sweep the river west and east as a fond
father might watch his children at play
never had he missed the opportunity the
hill offered now he trudged up the walk
into the house with never a backward glance

  he buried himself in the red-plush rocker
that faced the built-in fireplace the mantel
of which was adorned with trimmings from
half-forgotten tugboats he gazed absently
at the brass clock centrally placed among
the relics quarter past eight it was
barely an hour since he had gone down to
the companys office it seemed like a life-
time for the better part of fifty years he
had lived for this hour

  times without number before this very
fireplace or down at the genial algoma he
had told his friends of the things he would
do when he retired through that inward
eye of the mind he had seen himself lording
it over the younger men and telling of the
feats he had performed they would laugh
at him if he dared tell of them now the
pretty picture was smashed to atoms and
by that insignificant warrington the
shame of it the irony the bitterness he
had been laid on the shelf in his prime his
life of usefulness was outlived he had been
fired

  yet he could not and would not believe
it mr warrington had make a mistake
but the little clock on the mantel sadly
ticked back to him that he was wrong it
was true and it cut deeper than any knife

  the fannie l was hauled up for minor
repairs that morning so there was nothing
for him to do but sit in front of the fireplace
gaze at its rusty irons and rake over the
ashes of his vanished dreams only the
week before he had looked to his guns and
put them in order not that they needed at-
tention but rather with a fatherly fondness

  if he knew the great lakes from duluth
to buffalo and every inch between so also
he knew every twist and turn the upper
goulais made he had whipped trout from
one end of it to the other when snow came
he knew where the moose-runs crossed its
banks the upper goulais was to have
been the land of his retirement

  as he loved the life of the lakes so too

he loved the great open stretches of the
height of land the sheer falls of granite
over which white water tumbled the un-
beaten paths through the great bush that
lay north of superior

  every yearning hope had been put away
carefully against the day when he would
lord it over those hills in season and out
now all that was gone

      summer had been hot stifling
c-qj so when the season changed to the
  more pleasant indian summer the
soo felt relief and was glad but none
of its smiles touched the heart of donovan
he coveted each day as man covets fife
itself

  in anticipation of its five months rest
shipping grew heavier donovan like a
man in a dream bent himself in the stream
of lake-traffic late and early striving as he
never had before in the feeble hope that
mr warrington might see his error and
retrieve the awful blunder but no such
reconsideration appeared to be forthcoming
the only ray of hope he had was that mr
warrington had told no one else of his re-
tirement neither had young sparks been
told that he was to have the fannie l in the
spring donovan prayed with all his heart
and soul that some chance might come to
redeem all that had been lost

  the warm days lingered the schedule
of the lakes clung on donovan robbed
each hour of each day of the wealth that
suddenly had come to mean so much to him
then to put hurried halt to such unprec-
edented liberties came winter in one
night morning found st marys river
filled with ice brought down through the
rapids from lake superior abruptly all
shipping ceased

  during the next few days belated freight-
ers were caught in the floes and limped into
improvised winter moorings storm-bat-
tered and shrouded with ice donovan took
the fannie l to her berth with the air of a
man going to his own funeral still he was
loathe to leave he was resolute in his
determination to stay aboard until the tug
was ice-bound he would remain to the
bitter end

  there was no comfort for him in the
preparations- of the river-front laying up
for the winter what if the whole little
world of the lakes had stopped short for
the time being with its mind turned toward
in his prime



spring anticipating five months rest and
then the new season donovan had come
to the end of the tether he had moored
the fannie l for the last time

  the winter now coming on already here
in fact held nothing for him spring was a
hideous nightmare he tried to argue with
himself that he should not take it so hard
but the argument proved futile when a
man has lived his life toward a certain goal
whether that goal be fame fortune or sec-
ond youth it breaks his heart to see his goal
vanish as completely as a bubble bursts
donovans goal had done just that try
as he might he could not bring himself to
see it in any other light

  his only hope lay in mr warrington and
now that lake-traffic had virtually ended
even that hope had vanished still he re-
fused to leave the fannie l until the last
vestige of life on the lakes was frozen in
still he kept up steam and waited for the
undreamed whatever it might be wherever
it might lead to save him

  and even as he waited there came tid-
ings that swept over the soo like the
knell of calamity the last boat to come
struggling down superior brought the story
that the keepers of whitefish light had had
their boat crushed in the ice trying to get
off the tale spread from home to home all
over the soo

  every living soul in the town knew within
the hour that the men were nearly out of
provisions and that it would be weeks be-
fore the ice was frozen solid enough to bear
them to mainland tragedy was so close
it seemed just the other side of the soos
backyard fence something must be done
the lighthouse tender had been forced to
tie up somewhere below mackinac in its
stead the government revenue cutter ottawa
went to rescue the imprisoned men

  donovan standing in the pilot-house of
the fannie l watched the ottawa go the
cutter was a smart something too smart
too bedecked in brass and fittings mused
donovan as he watched her he knew the
job ahead it was a rough-and-ready job
the kind of work the fannie l was built for
he was on the point of putting the thought
into action when another brain-musing told
him to bide his time the ottawa would
fail

  he was not moved to deep pity for the
men at the light ordinarily his heart would
have gone out to them now it was far too

heavy to respond to any call but one and
as he thought of the light-keepers donovan
was very sure that the call was coming
what if it should spell failure for him as
well as for the ottawa if it did he would
not come back to tell of it there was not
the remotest fear in the thought

  even as he stood in the pilot-house of his
tug he was as much cut off from the world
he had lived for as were the men at the
light he knew ice could tear wicked gashes
in the best of hulls but old superior was
kind and let sleeping things lie her dead
never came back patiently he bided his
time and waited for the ottawa to return

it was late in the afternoon of the
following day that the government
cutter reappeared above st marys
rapids steaming slowly down toward the
locks an eager expectant crowd had gath-
ered by the lime she came in they had
gathered fearfully and half-expected the
news that soon swept wraith-like up and
down the locks and out beyond into the
town the light-keepers were not on the
ottawa she had tried to reach them again
and again only to be pushed roughly aside
by the grinding merciless ice if the story
spread gloom over the whole town it fired
the heart of donovan

  barely had the ottawa reached her moor-
ing when the fannie l rasped away from
hers backwatered into the channel and blew
for the lock the strident challenge of it
settled down over river and town like a bat-
tle-cry mr warrington in the tugboat
office going over the seasons record of profit
and loss heard it he went to the window
to make sure and then grabbed madly for
his hat and coat

  fifteen minutes later he was bobbing up
and down the lock wall like a loose-jointed
jumping-jack a screaming fury who hurled
anathema at the imperturbable donovan
the truth of the matter was that for all his
haste mr warrington had arrived at the
lock a trifle too late to stop either donovan
or the fannie l the upper gate had swung
open the fannie l had flung off both bow
and stern lines

  the only answer mr warrington had for
all his racket was a mocking swush-swush
that bubbled fiendishly under the tugs
stern as she got away but the little owner
stuck to his task manfully he ran along
the lock wall for half a mile cursing and


adventure

praying by turn and stopped finally only
from sheer despair

  see what comes of trusting a first-class
tug to a doddering old numbskull he
wailed donovan should have been re-
tired years ago

  as his mind went back to the profit and
loss figures he had another fit of sorrow
the fannie l was gone that was certain
mr warrington never expected to see the
tug again

  when donovan swung clear of the ship
canal and veered the tug around until she
butted her stubborn nose against the cur-
rent and the teeth of the wind he knew well
that there was a real nights work to be done
the tug was lashed down ready for it he
held her so she skirted the larger floes and
made her cut viciously into the smaller
ones there would come a dull thud as he
put her head on into a heavy mass of ice
wormed her bow shrough it and then eased
away to send the great lumps a-thumping
along her beam she was built for rough
work and held to her task grimly

  they had laid him on the shelf in his
prime he would show them point aux
pines slipped past a purple-black smudge
against the northern horizon up beyond
its dark shadow was to have been the land
of his retirement all that was gone now the
most he could hope for was to save his pride

  it was nearly midnight when intermittent
flashes of light cut through the black night
directly ahead the men were still at
whitefish donovan leaned into his work
the wheel could spin like a saucer in oil but
he held it in a grip of iron and put his weight
to the turn as if he were taking the tug to
port or starboard through the ice-field by
sheer strength

  the fannie l as if part of him dodged
this way and that getting her blunt nose
down every now and then to butt a recalci-
trant floe and send it swirling and groaning
along her flank out of the course

  another hour passed before donovan
brought the tug to half-speed far above
the light winked feebly its lenses fashioned
to save the whiter gleam fpr the distant
channel the flash of it cutting a wide arc
through the inky blackness overhead he
saw three waving figures outlined against
the base of the lights towering shaft and
thought he caught a faint hallo there was
no time to waste with mere signals rather
donovan was busy with the lay of things

cautiously as a cat picks its way up a
strange alley he felt a course through the
slush ice between the menacing floes slowly
circling the light

  he saw that the floes coming down the
lake had piled an ever changing barrier of
ice around the rocks on which the light
stood it was evident that in attempting
to launch their boat through this grinding
barrier the light-keepers had met disaster
the tug might easily have plowed her
way through it but the water there was shal-
low and kept her off it would be folly for
the men to attempt to sm through the
freezing water to the tug some way must
be found to reach them the task looked
impossible little wonder it had baffled the
ottawa

  twice donovan sent the tug creeping
around this wicked strip of rock and ice as
he tried to find aay to the imprisoned
men then the gong in the engine-room
clanged a staccato order the tug swung
suddenly into the wind donovan had
found his element they had shelved him
in his prime he who could handle a raft
with the best of them the ottawa had
known nothing of rafts

  some two hundred yards up the lake a
huge floe loomed up through the darkness
bearing down past the light there was a
raft to handle an ice-raft that weighed
tons a battering-ram that could laugh at
shallow water and jagged rocks and crash
through the barrier of ice surrounding the
light as a thrown brick shatters glass

  the job was to put it to work with a
full head of steam donovan sent the tug
quivering into it fought for warping-room
gained an inch slowly forced the sullen
mass to a halt then began the struggle for
dear fife

  the steam-exhaust from the tug roared
like some beast of prey as she flung the ice-
raft back against the current then dono-
van swung her clear again and went hard to
port circling the ice-floe until the tug could
poke her nose into the up-lake end of it
then the exhaust chanted a double fury
against the wind as the fannie l almost
lifting her bow out of the water sent the
huge mass to bore down on the barrier that
had made the ottawas attempt futile

  the men at the light grasped what was hap-
pening and in another moment as the huge
ice-raft smashed through donovan bellowed
and they ran for it making a wild scramble
in his prime



over the bridge of ice to the tug they tum-
bled over the side of the tug just before the
whole mass of ice heaved hung motionless
for a second and then crumbled into a thou-
sand pieces with the black water surging up
through the ever widening crevices snort-
ing triumph the fannie l churned back
from the rocks to safety

it was dawn when donovan
brought her bruised and weary
down through the locks he had
run up every sign of a flag the tugs locker
possessed and it was with gaily floating pen-
nons that she made her triumphal return
news of her coming brought half the soo
to her dock by the time she had locked
through little mr warrington hoped the
town was there in its entirety as he bounded
over the tugs side and burst into captain
donovans arms

  hurrah for donovan he cried i knew
you could do it i knew you could do it
every whistle along the river shrieked
bedlam there were other praises and rous-
ing cheers hosts of them words of heart-
felt thanks were mingled with the tears of
joy from relatives and friends of the rescued
light-keepers but donovan hardly heard
his ear was tense for something else from
mr warringtons lips it came when the
first fluster was over donovan was gra-
ciously asked to come to the tugboat
office

  we have made a grave error captain
donovan said mr warrington rather
pompously young sparks fortunately
has not been told so there is no difficulty
about it of course you will take over the
fannie l in the spring

  if on the former occasion the tugboat

office had yawned suddenly abysmal to him
now with equal suddenness it crowded down
upon and cramped donovan he wanted
to take a full breath the first for weeks
the dingy little place was entirely too small
to hold him he burst forth into the freer
air

  as he hurried down the dock he smiled
right and left to all who passed yet for
all his haste he gained the summit of gore
street some ten minutes later with barely
heaving lungs arrived there he fingered
as was his custom while his eye swept the
river west and east he saw that the lower
reaches of superior were gray a white bar
blocked the channel around sugar island
then he entered the house

  he might have been an hour perhaps two
in his labor of putting everything shipshape
at last the smallest relic on the mantel was
in order the brass clock ticked peacefully
the iron kettle sang merrily on the crooked
hook over the fire the tiniest speck had
vanished from his resplendent guns his
shoe-packs were newly greased then and
not until then did he pause in his work of
putting everything ready for the new day
satisfied with his efforts he searched for
pen and paper and drew himself up to his
table

whs well would you look at that
imni saspec- the astonished mr warring-
ton the next morning over his mail

  donovan climbing down from the jerky
lumber train of the algoma central at the
goulais river crossing winked knowingly
at the snow-capped hills and wondered how
much consternation his resignation had
caused truly his day had come and the
way he had planned it
arthur ofriel

author of the tapir the vampire etc

i believe that story of yours senhor
you tell me that while you two north
americans were far out on the great
ocean steaming southward on your
way to explore our amazon headwaters a
vulture came speeding from nowhere and
settled in the rigging of another boat near
you and that soon afterward a terrible
storm swept that vessel to her doom

  yes i believe it for i know as all
brazilians know the fiendish power those
ugly birds have of scenting death even be-
fore death strikes and we rubber-workers
of the wild javary region who see much of
death see much also of those vile things
which live on death

  sometimes senhores we see vultures
without wings which walk about in the
shape of men yes human vultures who
scent human weakness as do their foul
brothers of the air and come from afar to
prey on that weakness until they have
stripped their victims to the bare bones
and now while we stream on down the
amazon i can tell you the tale of one of
those creatures-a tale of the bush but yet
not of the bush for these things came about
not in the depths of the unknown jungle but
in a jungle town on the banks of the javary

  that town is remate de males in your
language remate de males means culmina-
tion of evils yet it is not a bad town as
these upper amazon towns go it got its

name i have heard from the sufferings of
the first people who settled there-fever
and famine and other misfortunes which
attacked them until out of twenty settlers
only four survived even now it is no real
town like manaos and other places on this
great river

  but to us seringueiros who toil for months
among the dangers and diseases of the
swamp-lands it is a place where we can go
and amuse ourselves when the floods drive
us from our work and when men have
labored long in the wilderness with death
always lurking at their backs any town
where they can play is not a bad town at all

  at the time of high water i came into
remate de males with a young comrade
pedro andrada who like myself worked on
the big seringal of coronel nunes we
were more than fellow workers we were
comrades recently we had been out on a
long roving trip along the brazilian-peru-
vian frontier and had come back so gaunt
and tired that we were glad to rest for a
time at the headquarters of the coronel

  but after a few days of ease we found this
very dull since most of the other men had
gone out to spend their time and money at
their homes or if their homes were too far
away at remate de males so after
drawing some money from the coronel we
paddled down the river for several days
until we reached the town


the vulture



  there we hitched cur dugout to one of the
posts before the door of a trader named joa-
quim whom we knew well and went inside
several friends of ours were loafing there
and for a time they kept us busy telling of
our adventures on that rambling trip then
we asked what we could do to enjoy our-
selves they grinned

  if you have a pocketful of money you
can do anything you like at the house of
urubu answered one

  the house of the vulture i do not
understand i said

  you are behind the times lourenfo
another man laughed you have not been
here since the last flood is it not so we
now have a real urubu and he will give
you any game you like and pick you
clean

  this sounds interesting said my com-
rade pedro his brown eyes twinkling
remate de males is becoming quite a city
what sort of thing is this urubu of which
you speak

  then spoke joaquim the trader and his
tone was sour

  he is a remate de males in himself if
there is anything worse than he i have not
yet seen it he takes the life from honest
men and devours their bodies afterward
the men looked at one another then
one said

  that is a hard thing to say joaquim i
think you are jealous because we spend
money there instead of here urubu is no
cannibal

  where are ricardo bautista and alberto
alencar demanded joaquim each was
drunk at his place and the next morning
each was gone gone where no man has
seen them since

  nobody spoke joaquim went on

  i would not say that he actually ate
them but there is a jacare-assu-a huge
alligator-living under his house and per-
haps that reptile could tell things if he
would a jacare does not live where it finds
no food

  again there was silence then helio
alves said slowly

  i have been wondering what became of
that girl januaria you remember her
friends-the big girl with the very red
mouth i liked her the last time i saw
her she said she was going to quit him
that was nearly a week ago has any one
seen her lately

  the others shook their heads a fellow
named miguel said

  there has been no boat this week she
must be here still perhaps she is sick
ask that jacare under the house where
she is sneered joaquim

  i will ask urubu to his face where she
is growled helio

  and i will ask maria my own sweet-
heart what has become of her added
miguel

i broke in then and told them we
were still waiting to learn who and
what this urubu might be miguel
told me

  his name is aracu but some man who
was half-drunk in his place so that his tongue
got twisted called him urubu and the name
fitted him so well that he has been urubu
here ever since he looks like a king vulture

  he came first they tell me to nazareth
across the river there in peru he wanted a
house here in remate de males where more
people come but he could not find one
empty and he would not build one instead
he got domicio malaguetta to drinking and
gambling in his place in nazareth domi-
cio owned the finest house here except the
hotel before long that house and every-
thing in it belonged to urubu

  domicio and his family had to go and
live in a mean little barracdo where he and
his wife died of fever the place that used
to be domicios home is now a house of
entertainment rim by urubu perhaps you
remember domicio

  i did remember domicio he had been
quite a prosperous trader and a steady sort
of man though fond of his drink i was
sorry to hear of his miserable end as i
thought of it i remembered something else

  domicio had a pretty young daughter
i said what has become of her

  she is in the house of urubu she had
no money and a girl must live she is not
so pretty now

  at this we scowled the daughter of
domicio was nothing to us but this thing
displeased us miguel went on

  there are other girls where they come
from i do not know but they come here
with domengos peixoto domengos is a
great friend of urubu and he seems quite
prosperous now he wears a gold watch
and chain travels up and down the big
river and does not drink so hard as he did


adventure

  this was surprizing news to us when we
had last been here this domengos peixoto
had been a low ragged drunkard whom no-
body liked and nobody would trust-a
hanger-on at places where card-games were
played and always thirsting for a drink
it was hard to imagine him sober well
dressed and traveling about like a gentle-
man

  i see said pedro his voice hard do-
mengos travels on the river-and brings
girls here i see i think i will go and look
at domengos i am curious to know how
he looks with his face washed

  he is not here now said some one
he has been away for a time

  then i will look at this urubu who owns
domengos i suppose i shall not offend
you by offering to buy you all a drink

  every one sat up as if he had suddenly
heard a voice calling him

  to show you how much offended i am
miguel laughed i will allow you to buy me
two drinks

  we trooped out leaving joaquim looking
after us sourly but wistfully too after
what he had said he could not well go to the
house of urubu and drink perhaps he
consoled himself with some of his own
cachassa when we were gone

  in our dugouts and montarias we paddled
up the street where the water was several
feet deep to the house of urubu pedro
and i had never been in it before for domi-
cio malagueita had not invited seringueiros
to be his guests now we found it fitted
with the furnishings of a comfortable home
but with some partitions taken out to make
a long room across the front

  in this room around several small tables
sat a few men and girls quietly playing
cards another girl lolling in a richly
colored hammock at one end was picking
idly at a wire guitar a sort of bar ran
half-way across the room beside the farther
wall and on it were a liquor-jar and a few
 cups

  wake up shouted miguel here are
lourengo moraes and pedro andrada with
a six-months thirst and pockets full of
money where is that urubu we want
drinks

  they woke up the men most of whom
knew us shouted greetings the women
swiftly looked us over and then smiled and
called to us the one in the hammock sat
up and i saw that she was the malagueita

girl she had been rather proud and shy
but now she was as bold as any of them
she made eyes at my handsome partner
and asked if he would buy her a drink too

  i buy for all little one said pedro as if
he did not remember her my thirst is
long and my pocket strong boys and
girls let us see who can empty his cup
quickest who fills the cups

  i said a deep voice behind the bar a
door had opened there and beside the jar
and cups stood urubu

rfsj- as miguel had said the man
looked like a king vulture-that
	bird which drives the common buz-

zards from their feasts to gorge himself
bulky and squat with humped shoulders
he had also the vultures head and face
his head blunt as a bullet was red and bare
except for a little short black hair his nose
was a hooked beak his eyes were cold as
those of the bird of death his mouth
was a hard slit his hands curled around
cups on the bar looked like claws looking
at him and remembering what i had just
been told i felt that the drunken man who
named him urubu had been only drunk
enough to speak truth

  he watched us with a cold stare his
mouth stretched into a smirk

  what is your pleasure senhores he
asked

  what have you pedro wanted to know
anything you like cachassa of course
and he pointed a thumb at the jar or
aguardiente cauim-all those things there
is also fine liquor from europe and north
america-cognac whisky gin cordials-
whatever you wish senhores

  i have drunk no liquor but cachassa for
months said pedro i want something
fancy make me a tail of the cock

  urubu stared so did the rest of us

  a what demanded urubu

  a tail of the cock an american whom
i knew in santarem used to make them for
himself and they are very fine they are
made by mixing several things together
can you make one

certainly i can make you a cocktail
senhor i did not quite understand you
he reached under the bar produced
several bottles mixed up the liquors and
asked-

  what will your broad-shouldered friend

have
the vulture



  i said i would have a cocktail also the
others ordered their drinks and we quickly
emptied our cups

  pedro and i burst out coughing that
drink was the worst i had ever swallowed
every one laughed at us except urubu
whose face was like wood

  what do you call that demanded
pedro angrily that is no tail of the
cock

  perhaps you have forgotten the taste of
a real cocktail answered urubu a slight
sneer in his tone or perhaps you are
accustomed to such drinks as are made for
girls

  perhaps you are accustomed to mixing
drinks only for ignorant indians-the kind
of indians who eat rotten turtle retorted
pedro and if you think me a girl step
out here and i will show you how girlish
i am

  for a moment it was very quiet un-
winking expressionless the vulture eyes of
urubu stared into the hot brown eyes of my
comrade then his slit of a mouth stretched
again and he shrugged his humpy shoulders

  do not be so hasty senhor he said
that was only my little joke perhaps
the american senhor made his cocktails
differently-there are several ways of mix-
ing those drinks will you have some of
the north american whisky

  i will drink anything to take this taste
out of my mouth

  then here is something very fine

  the beak-nosed man set a bottle on the
bar

  you see it is a new bottle and the cork
has not been drawn

  yes and i see that i do not want it
refused pedro i have seen that label
before the american senhor had a bottle
like that one he said that the stuff in it
looked like whisky and tasted like whisky
but it was really old crow i do not want
anything made from old crows give me
some cachassa

  urubu said nothing more i had some
cachassa also and the familiar taste soothed
my tongue the vulture-man glanced at
the malagueita girl who stood beside pedro
and drank with him at once she invited
pedro to sit in her hammock and let her
play to him

  gladly my lady he accepted i have
not heard a guitar for a long time and
they turned away

   i too turned and took a few steps toward
 one of the card-tables then i whirled on
 my heel as i expected the eyes of urubu
 were on my partners back and there was a
 threat in them-a threat of evil that put
 me on my guard i strode to the bar

   more meat for the jacare i said in a
 low tone was that what you were
 thinking

    for the first time his eyelids flickered
 his unpleasant gaze centered on my face
 after a minute he answered-

   ldo not get your meaning senhor

   i think you do i shot back and
 make no mistake we are men of the
 bush he and i and we are accustomed to
 jacares-and to urubus also

   with another shrug he said he did not
 quite grasp my little joke i said no more
 for no more was necessary but helio
 who had been standing near now spoke
 up

   i do not see januaria here he said
 where is she

   she has fever urubu answered
 promptly i sent her down to the soli-
 moes where the air is better

   when how to what place on the
 solimoes

   when when she was taken sick the
 fever came on her late at night and i saw
 it would be bad so i sent her out at once
 to tabatinga

   how insisted helio who took

	her

   by canoe ricardo bautista and al-
 berto alencar were here and they paddled
 away with her

   ricardo and alberto they disappeared
 weeks ago

   i know they had no money left so
 they went down-river to earn some they
 came back together late that night and i
 coaxed them to take her away until she
 should be well ricardo was a friend of
 januaria you remember

    helio nodded slowly as if that were true
 but he could not believe the rest of it
 without saying anything further he took
 another drink and then sat down at a table
 the rest of us also drifted to the tables and
 i sat for a time smoking drinking and
 talking to a couple of men who like myself
 were not in the mood for cards one of the
 women bothered me at first with her atten-
 tions but after i succeeded in discouraging
 her i was left in peace
io

adventure

the malagueita girl i noticed was
  softly singing love-songs to pedro
  but he did not seem much interested
  after a time he looked at me moved his
  head toward the door and arose urubu
  who had been standing quiet and waiting
  looked sharply at our rolls of milreis as we
  paid for all the drinks then he asked why
  we left so soon

    we told him the truth-that we must find
  a place to live in he urged us to stay
  there saying he could make room for us and
  would make us very comfortable the
  irls of course said the same but we
  refused and went out

    a cold rascal said my partner as we
  paddled away he spoiled my thirst and
  i dislike him much but i intend to see
  more of him he interests me

    back to the store of joaquim we went
  and there we tied our canoe as before

    we have seen your urubu and we do not
  like him i told him he grinned in a
  satisfied way

    i knew you would not he answered
  you two are not blind spendthrifts and
  you have heads on your shoulders yet if
  you would buy supplies here you had best
  buy them now for urubu will get your
  money as he gets that of others

   how

    by drink gambling women--or in
  other ways i know you are not easily
  made drunk and are not passionate gamb-
  lers or lovers of women but he will get you
  in some way i am surprized that he did
  not ask you to stay there until your money
  was gone

    we answered that urubu had done so
  but that we preferred to live elsewhere and
  had come to ask if he knew of a place we
  added that if we could find a house where
  we could live by ourselves we should want
  to buy a number of things in his store it
  did not take him long to think of the place
  we wanted and soon we were settled in a
  small barracdo facing the river tecuahy

    before long a mantaria came up to our
  door and in it was helio looking both
  doubtful and grim

    i do not believe urubus story of janua-
  ria he growled she showed no sign of
  sickness when i last saw her and the prt
  about ricardo and alberto sounds queer to

	me they did not disappear at the same
  time and they were not comrades as you
  two are so why should they work together

and return together and they were
rough hard men who thought only of
themselves and if they came back with
money they would not let a girls sickness
interfere with their staying here and drink-
ing

  what is more they have had plenty of
time to return from tabatinga but they
have not come back the tale does not
sound good to me at all and what joa-
quim said about the jacare disturbs me
it is true that a jacare-assu lives under the
house of urubu-i have seen the beast
myself

  miguel was to talk to his sweetheart
i reminded him perhaps he will learn
something

  he has talked to her and has learned
nothing helio replied i have just seen
miguel maria said she knew nothing
about januarias sickness or her going
away she would not talk about it and
she seemed afraid urubu might overhear
what miguel said

  that does not look very good either
said pedro the story of urubu may be
true and we can not prove it is not but
there is one thing you can do helio if you
are really interested in this matter say
nothing to any one but start at dawn to-
morrow and go to tabatinga it is only
about thirty miles and you can soon learn
whether your girl is there

  i will do it vowed helio i will go
before any one else is awake when i come
back i will tell you what i find out

  he left us putting a vicious punch into
his strokes as he pulled away

  i think said pedro watching him
that before long helio and urubu are
going to have trouble

  and i think i added that if any one
else here disappears i should like to kill that
jacare and see what is inside him

  i had the same thought he nodded
but i hardly believe there will be anything
new before helio returns

  he was not quite right before helio
came back to us something new did come
about and as the result of it my comrade
forced himself into the affairs of the vulture

in the next two or three days we
went several times to the house of
urubu we lost a little money at
cards but not enough to hurt us much we
drank as much as we liked but that was
the vulture



only enough to make us merry and
though the girls did their best to charm us
we paid no more attention to them than to
the men-joking with them playing cards
with them and buying drinks but not allow-
ing any foolishness

  we knew that this was not at all what
urubu wanted but he gave no sign of impa-
tience the flood waters were high we
could do no work and he had no reason to
suppose we should go elsewhere before the
dry season so he watched and waited as
a true vulture watches and waits for its
victim to fall into its power

  then came a boat on the boat came
domengos peixoto with domengos came
a girl and then pedro woke up

  the boat was one of these fine english
steamers of the amazon which call at
remate de males to leave passengers and
mail we were loafing in joaquims place
when she came in and for a minute we
thought a fight had started down the
street for we heard yells and the explosions
of rifles but then came the hoarse roar of
the whistle and we knew the shouting and
shooting were only the celebration that
always welcomes the steamer

  like the other men in the store we
started for our canoe but in the confusion
some man got our craft and paddled off in it
before we could reach it we promptly
grabbed the next boat-a good-sized mon-
taria-and in that we pulled away to the
river

  only four people left the steamer two
traveling traders domengos and the girl
we gave no attention to the traders but we
were interested in the other two do-
mengos standing with his stomach stuck
out importantly looked for a boat to take
him to the house of urubu but found none
then he saw us and the roomy montaria
we had borrowed

  here he called come here to me
take us to urubus place and i will give you
a drink

  at his offensive tone we growled

  we can buy our own drinks retorted
pedro wte are not boatmen for such as
you you can swim ashore unless you
bathe more often than you used to it will do
you good

  domengos scowled and his face seemed to
swell but then he swallowed his rage and
changed his manner

  oh you are my old friends pedro and

lourenfo i have not seen you for months
and i did not know you will you not take
me and my niece to the house old friends
that tone sounds more familiar said
pedro contemptuously it is the same
one you used when you begged drinks from

us last year you can go- 

  he stopped with a queer sort of gulp
his eyes had shifted to the girl and sudden
surprize had shot into his face

  i had only glanced at her but now i
looked at her more closely she was rather
small but she appeared healthy and strong
of body and pretty of face these things
were to be expected of a girl going to the
house of the vulture but it was something
else that interested me-she seemed shy
and she was looking at domengos as if
pedros scorn had stirred up doubt of her
companion then pedro spoke again and
like domengos he had changed his manner

  you can come with us we have room
for you

  puzzled i helped him move the montaria
into position domengos started to get in
but pedro blocked him

  hand the lady in first he told him
have you no politeness

  domengos showed his teeth but handed
the girl down into the montaria pedro
helped her to seat herself then before
domengos could get in he shoved the boat
away

  domengos teetered on his toes and nar-
rowly escaped stepping off into the river
other men in boats around us laughed

  what is this demanded domengos
one of your jokes come back and take
me in

  i have changed my mind grinned
pedro you can swim loureno pad-
dle hard straight to our barracao

much astonished i heaved on my
paddle and we surged away pedro
also stroked hard a few times then
he turned faced the girl and asked
sharply-

  angela what are you doing here

  a little cry of surprize came from her
pedro pedro andrada i did not
know you how big you have grown
three years makes a difference in a man
in this javary country he said here a
man must either be strong or die but
how come you here do you know that
man peixoto


adventure

  before she could answer yells from do-
mengos broke in

  step them he bellowed they are
stealing her capitao they steal my niece
they are kidnapers of the bush they will
hold her for ransom or worse will you let
a woman passenger be stolen under your
nose stop them

  halt there barked an english voice
behind us

  pedro only shoved his paddle in deep
we almost lifted the boat with our strokes

  halt roared the voice again a mo-
ment later a bullet smacked on the water
beside us followed instantly by the crack of
a rifle

  pedro tossed his paddle in the air and
held it there i lifted mine too the
montaria kept on going of itself but as we
took no more strokes no more bullets came
the same voice barked orders on the
steamer and a ships boat of men took the
water and spurted after us

  while they came pedro turned again to
the girl

  angela he said when i knew you in
santarem you were a good girl

  and i am now she cried her head high

  i believe you that is why i am doing
what i do peixoto is not your uncle you
must not go with him he is a lying dog
and he takes you to a place where no girl
can go and remain good

  then up swept the ships boat backed
oars and stopped a gray-mustached
grim-faced officer with rifle in hand snapped

  hand over the lady and be quick
what do you mean by this

  i mean to see that she is protected
pedro explained with dignity you do
not understand the matter that peixoto
is a liar and worse-much worse he
brings an innocent girl here to put her in the
house of the vulture perhaps you can
judge what sort of house that is by the
name of it

  i know this girl-we grew up in the
same town santarem she can tell you
whether i am a woman-stealer or an honest
man

  the keen eyes of the officer went to her
and though she was much disturbed she
nodded quickly

  it is true she said i know pedro and
he is to be trusted and i-i do not know
that other man well he told me he would
get me a fine place to work in the house of

an english gentleman where i could care
for the children and live very well he told
me to say i was his niece so that we could
travel without questions i-i- oh
what shall i do now

  do not trouble yourself about that
angela mea pedro soothed her you
shall be well cared for until you can go
home you see senkor it is as i said

  the officer gazed shrewdly at him at me
at angela and at other men in the boats
around us snapping down a finger at one
of those men and holding it like a revolver
he barked-

  you what sort of a man is peixoto
the man laughed harshly and told him
just what sort of man peixoto was the
officer nodded

  i have wondered about him before this
he said he will not travel on our ship
again give way

  the oars dipped the boat moved
turned went back to the steamer we saw
domengos being taken off and not very
gently

  i think pedro i said as we watched
this that you have pushed domengos off
his perch the officer said he would travel
no more on the english boats if he can
not bring women here he will be useless to
urubu he will soon be ragged and dirty
again and whining for drinks as he used to
are you not ashamed to have ruined so
worthy a citizen

  pedro grinned and made some answer but
i lost it because the other men around us
laughed and drowned his words and the
thing i had predicted came true senhores-
domengos did become once more a hanger-
on and beggar but it was not because
urubu dismissed him the big boats do
not call often at that town and before the
next one came several things had happened
which stopped any attempt he might have
made to travel again

now we pushed on toward our bar-
racao and there we heard more of
the story of angela domengos
had found her she said not at santarem but
at ega a town much nearer to us and on the
river teffe in the years since pedro had
left santarem her mother had died and her
father had moved to ega taking angela
with him then he too died and she had
to work in the house of an italian settler
whose wife was ill-tempered and treated
the vulture

her badly this was very disagreeable
for the girl but she could not leave because
she had no other home and never was given
any money

  then domengos came looking important
and telling the people of ega he was an up-
river trader he visited the white people of
the town who were glad to learn from him
the latest news of affairs along the big river
and in this way he came into the house
where she lived

  soon after that he managed to talk with
her alone and ask her questions and she told
him her whole story then he told her his
he about the english gentleman he knew
whose wife wanted a girl to help her with
the children and would give her money and
pretty things to wear so believing all he
said and thinking him very kind she took
her few belongings and ran away from her
bad-tempered mistress

  on the way up the river he treated her
well she said and it was not until she heard
pedros contemptuous answers that she be-
gan to suspect he was not the respectable
trader he claimed to be even now she
found it hard to realize that he was so bad
and asked if we were sure it was true we
left no doubt in her mind about that we
pointed out that he would not dare treat her
ill on the steamer because there she could
appeal to the captain and make trouble for
him but after he got her into the house of
urubu she would have found him a low dog

  we told her little about the vulture and
nothing at all about the diasppearance of a
girl and two men at his house but she had
heard enough to know it was far fron being
the sort of place she had expected and now
she looked very forlorn

  a poor little girl homeless and penniless
and deceived with only us two hardened
bushmen for friends and her dream of a
happy life with kind people broken she
found it hard to hold back the tears and
when she stepped to the doorway and looked
at the flooded town she could keep them
back no longer

  even the town is dirty and dismal she
cried santarem and ega are clean green
towns with fine sandy beaches but this is
nothing but a drowned mud-hole and the
air-the air is so damp it chokes me

  have courage angela pedro said
you shall leave it on the next boat that
goes down we would put you on that
steamer which brought you but it is up-

bound and must go many miles westward
before turning down again this is a
dreary place as you say but no harm shall
come to you here

  but where can i go from here i have
no money and one can not travel free on the
steamer i have nothing at all-that
peixoto must have my bundle with my
other dress and my beads and all

  do not trouble about the money he
urged her we will see to that and if
domengos has anything of yours he will not
keep it long i will go and get it now
taking his rifle he stepped toward the
door i too picked up my gun but he told
me to stay there and see that nobody both-
ered angela i hesitated and then sug-
gested that we take her with us and leave
her for a time with joaquim and his wife
this little barracdo i said was no fit place
for her though it was good enough for
him and me and she would be more com-
fortable and fully as safe at joaquims place
he agreed that this was so

  come angela he said you will like
paula the wife of joaquim for she has a
very good heart and it will be better for
you to stay there than here for one never
knows what may happen and later on in
your life some spiteful person might say you
lived with two men here and it might do
you much harm

  so we took her to joaquims home as
we expected he had already heard of the
matter from other men and after one look
into angelas innocent face he consented
to her staying with his family paula a
motherly woman also was glad to have her
there and the girl herself seemed to feel
better for their hearty welcome

  now she will be safe pedro said as we
paddled away

  if she does not get fever i added

  he nodded grudgingly and i knew he
thought of her words about the air choking
her the air of the javary is heavy and it
is loaded with disease as you senhores
know well and it is an odd thing but true
that people accustomed to the air of the
amazon often sicken and die soon after
leaving it for one of the branch rivers even
though they go only a few miles from the
main stream i wished now that i had not
said that but it was said and i could not
call it back neither of us spoke again un-
til we reached the house of the vulture
domengos had arrived there before us


adventure

but neither he nor urubu was in the big
room the men and girls loitering there
sat up with a jerk as we strode in with our
guns we saw that they had heard the
news nobody spoke and all watched us
in tense silence

  where is that cachorro growled pedro
looking about him

  that dog what dog some one
replied

  that dog peixoto he has a bundle
which is not his

  he is inside talking with urubu a man
answered the bundle he brought is there
on the bar

  in six strides pedro was at the bar and
had seized a small package i stood back
and watched every one as my partner
turned away the door behind the bar
opened and through it came domengos and
urubu

  behind you pedro i said

  he whirled and faced them but they
made no threatening move i do not think
they had known we were there for we had
spoken quietly and urubu looked slightly
surprized domengos seemed much dis-
tressed  his face glistened with sweat and he
cringed like a kicked cur urubu i
judged had been saying unpleasant things
to him

  i thank you domengos for leaving this
bundle where i could get it so easily pedro
mocked it will go straight back to its
owner if either or both of you wish to
do anything about this matter now is the
time

  you will pay me the passage money
spent on your woman sputtered do-
mengos

  are you sure come here to me and
collect it

domengos opened his mouth and
let it stay open but no words came
he looked sidewise at urubu whose
harsh face remained expressionless we
knew well that the money spent on bringing
angela here had come from the pocket of
the vulture not from that of domengos
but he said no word

  then pedro cursed them both he
cursed them thoroughly and well he
called them such names as no real man
would have swallowed yet he said noth-
ing of the jacare under the house or of the
two men and the girl who had disappeared

he used fighting talk meant to goad them
into fight then and there

  but he had forgotten the nature of vul-
tures a vulture does not attack anything
dangerous nor did urubu show fight now
and domengos looking at our faces and
our guns not only cringed still more-
he cowered behind the bar

  when pedro stopped urubu spoke coldly
your talk is for domengos not for me
if he deceived any girl that is his mistake
i want no girl here who does not come of her
own wish when you have grown cooler
you will realize that this is not such a place
as you say our girls are well treated as
they will tell you and no girl need stay here
unless she wants to and if domengos has
brought you a friend who does not know
men that is your good fortune-if you care
for green fruit every man to his taste
bah snorted pedro i will waste no
more words on you except to tell you again
that you are a foul liar

  he spat and turned to the door i
backed out keeping my eyes on the pair
behind the bar we paddled away

  as we cruised down the street an odd
thing happened up in the air two birds
got to fighting and one of them came tum-
bling down into the water stunned and bleed-
ing from a beak-blow on the head we
swung toward it but before we reached it
the water around it seethed and it was drag-
ged under several fish showed for an
instant on the surface we knew them for
piranhas those strong-jawed fish which
maddened by blood will chop to frag-
ments any wounded creature they find

  piranhasl muttered pedro here in
the street perhaps they and not the
jacare-assu could tell us what became of
ricardo and alberto

  if so we shall know when the waters go
down i said there will be bones the
jacare would leave no bones but would
swallow all

  weeks must pass before this street will
be dry he answered unless i am mis-
taken we shall learn more before that
time and we did

  back at joaquims place we gave the
bundle to angela she had become more
cheerful now and with the return of her
little treasures she smiled again the
smile and the warm look of gratitude she
gave pedro made me realize for the first
time how pretty and appealing she was i
the vulture



thought too that this strong but gentle-
hearted comrade of mine was just such a
man as she should have to protect her
through life and i saw paula glance at
joaquim as if the same thought came to her

  but the young couple themselves seemed
to have no such idea angela only asked
whether he had had any trouble in getting
the bundle and he said no he had simply
picked it up and walked out with it

  then we settled down to await the return
of helio we did our waiting at joaquims
and there other men joined us-the quieter
and steadier who did not care for the attrac-
tions of the vultures house but who liked a
drink and a card-game when in the mood
joaquim of course was a trader and his
store was not built for a place of entertain-
ment  but pedro suggested that it would be
good business to make room for some gam-
ing-tables sell us our drinks and take some
payment for the use of his store when we
pointed out that this would draw some trade
away from urubu he consented at once and
it was done

   soon there were three sets of men in the
town those who would not go to the house
of the vulture those who did go there for
the women and those who went to either
joaquims or urubus as the whim took
them through these men who went back
and forth we kept well informed as to what
went on at the urubu house

   there was little news at first-a fight or
two caused by drink and jealousy over the
girls but nothing of personal interest to us
two then miguel told us that both his
girl maria and the malagueita girl were
asking about us

   i think friends that urubu has been ex-
pecting you to tire of staying away and
come back to have a lively time there he
said but now he is trying to learn
through the girls whether you intend to keep
on drawing away business to this store
and anna malagueita your little friend of
the hammock and guitar seems eager to
have you come and see her again pedro

   tell maria that urubu will be in a hotter
place than this before we spend any more
money in that house said pedro and i
hope anna will find a friend who will amuse
her in my place i stay here

  when we saw miguel again he grinned
and told us the malagueita girl had asked
him many questions about angela and
whether she and pedro were living together

he had said no that angela lived at joa-
quims and pedro saw no more of her than
any one else there then she had told him
to warn pedro to be careful lest some unex-
pected misfortune come to him

  she would not say what sort of mis-
fortune he went on perhaps she does
not know but she was very anxious that
i tell you and she was nervous lest urubu
know that she sent the message there is
something behind it i am sure

  thank her for me said my partner
and tell her i will keep my eyes open and
tell her if there is anything i can do to help
her in return she has only to send word to
me

   the truth was that miguel was wrong when
he said pedro saw little of angela he was
with her quite often going into the family
quarters behind the store and talking with
her and paula while i sat outside and told
stories with other men but miguel spent
more time at urubus place than with us
and he did not know this

the warning did not bother us but
it did make us keep our eyes open
and that same night when we
entered our barracao rather late after a
game at joaquims we nearly stepped on
a big snake

  it was a suruzuzu as you know the
bite of that snake means death swift and
sure even a small one will kill a strong
man and this one was more than six feet
long if we had not been a little more care-
ful than usual one of us would have died
that night

   it was our habit on returning late to find
our hammocks and sleep without making
any light but this time with the warning
fresh in our minds we thought it well to
light a candle and look about us and there
on the floor not far from us was that deadly
thing

   it had not yet coiled to strike but lay as
if about to do so i yelled jumped away
and threw my machete at it the knife
struck edge downward cutting the reptile
so that it was easily killed with a rifie-butt

   as miguel said there seems to be some-
thing behind that warning said pedro
this barracdo is surrounded by water so
is the whole town how did this beast come
here

  snakes sometimes come floating down
on drifting trees i reminded him it is
adventure

possible that some small driftwood lodged
against our door for a while and the suruzuzu
crawled off it but it is not at all likely

  no it will do no harm to look further
and see whether we have any other guests

  after throwing the snake outside we made
a thorough search but found nothing
then still suspicious we inspected our
rifles which had been left in the house while
we were away no harm had been done to
them nor to anything else in the place
there was no sign that any one had been
there so we said no more and went to
sleep

  the next night a more violent thing came
about a heavy solid blow struck the bar-
racdo and we sprang from our hammocks
to find the place shaking dangerously a
grinding crushing sound was passing slowly
along one side and when we got a light we
found the wall on that side caved in we
peered out in time to see a big tree go drift-
ing suddenly away down-stream

  we had been unpleasantly close to death
the barracdo you understand was built
high on poles just as all houses there must
be built to stand above the flood waters

  the floating tree had come very near
knocking it off its posts and crumpling it
into a wreck from which we would have little
chance of escape held in that sunken cage
carried away down the black waters among
alligators and piranhas and other evil things
-no we should not have had much chance
it was our luck that the house happened
to be firm and that the heavy tree had not
hit it squarely

  the night was dull but not black we
could see a short distance out across the
tecuahy but nothing strange was in sight
we listened but heard nothing as on the
night when we found the snake there was
no sign that it was not mere chance yet
we were quite sure it was not chance at all
for this reason there was little current
around our house and the drifting things
that came down usually passed by at quite
a distance out where the flow was stronger
it seemed almost impossible for such a thing
to happen unless a boat somewhere above
us had drawn that tree aside and guided it
to strike us and as i say the night was
not so dark but that men could do this

  it seems to me loureno said pedro
that before that thing hit us i heard voices
and paddles perhaps i was dreaming
perhaps i was not dreaming but was partly

awake and really heard it i am not sure
but things are becoming interesting in this
house

  quite so i agreed so interesting
that i am going to sit up a while and see if
anything else may come

  and i did sit up with my rifle across my
lap while my partner dozed with his own
gun close at hand but nothing at all hap-
pened before morning

  then after eating and loafing a while and
talking over the two narrow escapes we had
just had we decided to go to joaquims
place and ask some one in a casual way
about the movements of urubu last night
before we started though i suggested that
we finish up a small jug of cachassa which
we had bought from joaquim some days
before and which now needed refilling he
laughingly agreed that this was a happy
thought and with a mock bow to me he
lifted the vessel to his mouth

  an inch from his lips he stopped it for
an instant he held it there peering at it
then he lowered it stepped to the door
and again looked sharply at the clay

  have you been using white powder for
anything he asked

  no i have not had anything of that
sort

  neither have i yet there is white pow-
der on this jug

  it was so on the clay was a tiny smear
of white dust we scowled at it and at
each other

  i would not drink that cachassa i
advised

  i do not intend to when did you drink
last from it

  yesterday afternoon we both drank
you remember it was good then

  yes it was good then but this is an-
other day

  he drew back his arm to throw the jug
into the water but then he changed his
mind and held it

  on our way to joaquims place let us
stop and see meldo salles he said

  and when we got into our canoe he still
held the jug also we took our rifles with
us

meldos house was near by and
when we stopped there we found him
lazily smoking at the door

  meldo you said yesterday that you had
a pet monkey which was growing old and
the vulture



ugly and must be killed pedro reminded
him you also said he was a thief and
drank your cachassa have you killed him
yet

  ho-hum he yawned no not yet
i thought i would do it today

  then let me see him drink some cachassa
first we have a little left here bring him
out

  meldo yawned again got up sluggishly
went inside and brought out a heavy black
barrigudo monkey which showed its teeth
and seemed sullen when my partner lifted
the jug though the animal chattered and
reached toward it pedro handed it to him
and he drank greedily

  drink deep you thieving bicho meldo
said grimly it is the last drink you will
get before night i shall knock you in the
head

  perhaps you need not do that said
pedro

  then he began talking about something
else glancing now and then at the monkey
which still clutched the jug as if determined
to keep it after a time he broke off in the
middle of a sentence following his eye
meldo and i looked at the black barrigvdo

  the animal was swaying on his haunches
and seemed dazed soon he lost his hold on
the jug and slumped down on the floor
after lying there a minute he kicked a
couple of times and was still

  ha ha ha laughed meldo he is
dead drunk that rum of yours must be
strong

  without answering pedro pulled the
monkey to him and felt for its heart pres-
ently he took away his hand and replied

  you are partly right he is not drunk
but he is dead

  then he told meldo of the snake and the
tree meldo one of the quiet men who
often joined us at joaquims stopped yawn-
ing and became wide awake

  a little thing like a snake on my floor
does not disturb me much-i see plenty of
snakes when i am in the bush added
pedro and if people wish to amuse them-
selves by bumping trees against my bar-
racdo they can have their little joke but
any one who would spoil good liquor is a
vile brute and should be shot

  meldo grinned at his way of putting it
but quickly became serious again

  here is another thing he said helio
alves has not been seen for days he dis-

appeared overnight and he had been say-
ing ugly things about urubu because the
girl januaria was gone

  do not worry about helio i said i
think he is safe and will be back soon he
should have been here before now after
we see him we shall know more about what
to do

  meldo asked questions of course but we
told him no more then and got his promise
to say nothing until we were ready he
sank the poisoned jug where it would do no
harm threw the dead monkey out into the
current and went on to joaquims place

  meldo came with us and with a couple
of other men we got up a game at one of the
tables our careless questions about urubu
got us no information so we said nothing
further and gave our attention to the cards
we were still playing when helio arrived

  he came striding heavily in looking
gaunt and gloomy one glance at his face
told me what to expect briefly and bitterly
he spoke out

  januaria is not at tabatinga and has
never been there ricardo and alberto
have not been there either what is more
they never went down this river as urubu
said i have spent days on my way back
from tabatinga stopping and questioning
every one between there and here not one
person has seen or heard of them they

never left here and that--urubu

is their murderer i am going now to cut
out his foul heart

  wait called pedro

  then he told him what had happened
since he left to all except meldo and me
the story of the snake the tree and the
poison was news and they listened with
faces hardening while he talked two other
men came in and one of these was miguel

  but even yet we have no proof pedro
concluded urubu will say those three
must have been drowned and devoured on
their way to tabatinga and no man can
prove otherwise there is nothing at all
against him except suspicion

  then here is another suspicion for you
miguel broke in your little friend anna
malagueita is sick as januaria was

  she was not to be seen yesterday or last
night urubu said she was sick and at first
i thought nothing of it but late last night
i grew suspicious and this is why each of
the girls there has a little room to herself
as you perhaps know and the room of anna
i

adventure

is next to that of my girl maria i was with
maria last night for a while and on my way
out i went into annas room to ask how
she felt and see whether she wished to send
any further word to you the room was
empty

  maria had not come out yet and i
stepped back and asked her where anna
was maria is ajealous girl and she asked
what i cared about anna to tease her i
said i was much interested in anna and
a few other things of the sort she was

angered and cried out-

   you are too late miguel meo-you will
not see her again

  then she seemed suddenly scared be-
cause she had said this and i could not get
another word from her when we came out
into the big room and found that urubu was
busy gambling she seemed much relieved
that is afl

  that is enough growled pedro his
face black

   seizing his rifle he started for the door
what will you do pedro joaquim
called

  search that whole house and find anna
if i do not find her urubu will tell me where
she is-and i will make him tell truth
bah who could make that creature tell
truth snorted joaquim if you want
truth do as i told you before-ask that
jacare under the house

  pedro swung on his heel and stared at him
joaquim you speak sense he said
i will talk first to the jacare and then to the
vulture

  we talked and agreed what we should do
helio pedro and i stayed with joaquim
the others went and got guns and long poles
when all had returned pedro said grimly
helio do not kill him until we know
curse him as much as you like keep him
busy

  i will keep him busy helio promised
his voice harsh with hate

  we got into our boats and he paddled
straight to the house of urubu the rest
of us went there too but by roundabout
ways soon we had closed in around the
place on all sides

the posts holding up the house
were stout and high and the water
was not up to its floor a careful
look along the surface under that floor
showed that no alligator was floating there

inside the place we could hear helio cursing
urubu as a liar and other things far more
vile and demanding to know just what had
become of januaria we had no time to
listen for the low-spoken replies for we now
began prodding the mud with the poles we
had brought

  at first we got no results and after a
time we began to think the alligator was not
there now but then miguels pole moved
in his hand and he passed the word that he
had struck something alive more jabbing
followed then suddenly a rifle cracked

  it was joaquim who slew the beast the
thing had risen near him swimming slug-
gishly and the trader had put a bullet
squarely into one eye with a rolling surge
it turned belly upward

  men got their poles under it and held it
there pedro and i worked up beside it and
slashed open its bloated belly then we all
looked at one another with sick faces

  we knew what had become of anna mala-
gueita

  through the silence around us came the
voice of helio yelling another blast of oaths
at the vulture sudden fury seized us
hoarse curses broke from us we drove our
paddles into the water and threw our canoes
and ourselves around to the front of the
house

  in a snarling panting struggling knot we
leaped out on the platform and plunged
through the doorway of the people in that
big room we saw only two-helio and the
vulture they stood at the bar and that
bar was between them helio leaning across
it had his face almost in that of urubu and
he still spat burning curses the vultures
eyes were half-shut with an evil gleam in
them and both his hands were out of sight
below the wood

  even as we charged into the place helio
lost control of himself and seized urubu by
the throat the vulture heaved himself
backward and sidewise trying to escape
but helios hold was like an iron clamp
and he throttled him and shook him as a
dog would shake a rat

  then came a swift flash of steel helio
grunted and lost his hold urubu had
stabbed him in the shoulder

  with the knife still in his hand the vul-
ture turned to leap away from us into his
room but he never reached that room
we threw ourselves headlong over the bar
and fell on him some man cried out as the
the vulture

knife of urubu bit into him but after that
thrust the vulture stabbed no more the
weapon was knocked or wrested from him
and savage blows battered him to his knees

  some of those blows fell on us also
every man of us was like a maddened
jaguar thinking only of destroying him
and we struck in blind rage so that in our
struggles to get at him we got in the way
of our own attack some ones rifle-barrel
or butt hit me hard on the head dazing me
so that i staggered and had to grab the
bar to keep from falling

  while i leaned there i saw joaquim too
go stumbling back clutching an arm cut
by a jabbing machete miguel also was
out of the fight for he was the man who had
been stabbed after helio and now he was
limping away bending over with pain

  then i saw the vulture rise in the air
pedro had dragged him up and now he
threw him over the bar into the clear space
beyond there helio kicked him hard and
then fell on him his good hand pounding
him furiously pedro hurled himself across
the bar and jumped on him too the rest
of us stayed where we were for a few min-
utes for our first hot rage was partly satis-
fied and we were willing to let pedro and
helio settle their score

  pedro had dropped his rifle in the strug-
gle and some other man had pulled his
machete from his belt to kill urubu with
so that also was gone helio carried a knife
but he did not draw it now he wanted to
wring the vultures neck in his hands

  urubu fighting for his vicious life showed
desperate strength and the three of them
went rolling and tumbling about the floor
battering and clawing and tearing like fight-
ing jungle-cats and then came one of those
freaks of fight by which a loser sometimes
wins

  in a twisting plunging scramble pedro
and helio struck their heads together so
violently that the blow partly stunned
them they did not lose their senses but
for a few seconds they lay without moving
waiting for the numbness to pass and in
that time the vulture wrenched himself out
of their clutch and reeled up to his feet

  he was a frightful-looking thing now
his clothes hung in bloody tatters red
streams trickled from broken nose smashed
mouth and gashes on head and body one
hand hung as if broken and he breathed
in wheezing gasps as if ribs were crushed

tor an instant he stood there rocking on his
heels then as the men on the floor scram-
bled up and at him he sprang for the door

  shoot him yelled some one and a man
beside me snatched a fallen rifle up off the
floor and twitched back the hammer

  but he could not fire for pedro and helio
were bounding after urubu and a bullet
would have hit them we leaped over the
bar as we struck the floor we heard a
heavy splash outside

  we reached the door before the fugitive
came to the surface pedro and helio were
poised to leap in after him but they waited
until he reappeared so that he could not
trick them by turning underwater and
swimming away to one side

  but when he did break water again they
did not follow him instead they hung
there on their toes an instant then settled
back helio laughed harshly

  the vulture could not swim

  he came up splashing and fighting the
water with both hands his mouth opened
wide in a gulp for air before he got it he
strangled coughed and went down with a
bubbling gasp around him grew a red
stain as the water washed his open wounds

  again he came up his face now was
clay-white from his choked throat burst
a groaning cry as one hand came out of
water a gleaming thing fell from it other
things glinted around him on the surface
the water boiled

  por deosl shouted pedro piranhas

  yes senhores the piranhas had found the
vulture just as they had seized on that
hurt parrot a few days before they now
attacked the man who had thrown himself
among them before our eyes they chopped
him to death and no man moved until
the red waters had closed over his writhing
face for the last time and smothered his
cries forever

 g j then pedro and helio looked at
each other and helio said-

        let us have a drink

  i think we all felt the need of a drink
from the wreckage behind the bar we
pulled out bottles not broken in the struggle
there and from these we gulped stiff drinks
while we did so the room filled with men
who had seen or heard of the death of the
vulture and now came to learn all about it
we told them all we knew and soon we
learned other things


adventure

  who is in that room demanded a man
pointing at the door from which urubu used
to come

  i was nearest that door and for the first
time i noticed that since the fight it had
been pushed almost shut kicking it open
i found domengos peixoto beyond it he
was just hiding something inside his shirt

  jumping at him i forced his hand eut
and saw he held a huge roll of milreis i
wrenched this from him and shoved him
out to face the crowd

  old friends he whined cowering back
do not be harsh with me i have done you
no harm and i am only taking what is
mine that cursed urubu owes me much
money

  that is our money yelled a man the
money he got by cheating us with cards
and liquor

  no it is our money cried a woman
he robbed and cheated us girls and made
us slaves

  hold that money lourenfo called
pedro and he shouldered his way to me
then he told the rest

  before any one gets this money we want
the truth about ricardo alberto and
januaria we want to know how these
things were done domengos and you
girls too speak out you will profit by it

  so they spoke out and though no one
of them seemed to know all yet each knew
something and by putting these things to-
gether and searching the room of the vul-
ture afterward we got the whole truth

  all those who disappeared had died by
poison the poison was that same whitish
powder which we had found on our cachassa
jug it killed quickly but with so little
pain that the victim seemed only to fall into
sudden sleep thus there were no cries or
struggles from those who took it in their
liquor and nobody would be alarmed by
any noise before morning urubu could
quietly carry the body to his own room
where a part of his floor could be lifted out
and the murdered man or woman dropped
through to the big jacare waiting below

  ricardo and alberto though slain at dif-
ferent times had both been killed for the
same reason-their money each was a
shrewd gambler and a dangerous fighter
and the vulture finding them hard to cheat
and knowing he could not rob them alive
had robbed them dead

  the girl januaria had been put out of the

way because she knew far too much about
urubu and was likely to prove dangerous to
him-indeed she had openly threatened to
tell certain things she knew and anna
malagueita must have died because the
vulture knew she had warned us to be on
our guard

  urubu had been behind all the attempts
to kill us also but had not himself taken a
hand with the snake and the tree he had
worked through two worthless men of the
town who would do anything if well paid
and who became scared and went away after
the second attempt failed-we could not
find them when we went looking for them
and we never saw them again but the
poisoning -of our cachassa must have been
done by urubu himself while we were pass-
ing the evening at joaquims place

  if the floating tree should destroy us you
see no trace would be left of the poisoned
jug if the tree spared us and the poison
killed us there would still be no proof that
he had been concerned in it for men would
know we bought our cachassa from joaquim
and suspicion would be most likely to fall
on the man who had sold it to us to ruin
his enemy joaquim as well as to kill us
would be much to the taste of the vulture

  with these things settled in our minds
we settled the matter of the money pedro
pointed out that no man could prove how
much he had lost here that the losers had
had some pleasure in spending it that we
all could earn more money if we needed it
and that any attempt to divide it among us
would probably lead to trouble so he sug-
gested that we give it all in equal shares to
the girls of the house who had been pleasant
companions and who now had nothing the
men agreed and it was done

  when the girls had come up and taken
their money pedro still held one share

  this he explained goes to the little
girl who nearly came to this house but is
now at the house of joaquim she must
have money to take her home and i intend
to see that she has plenty

  after a minute of silence a whining voice
asked

  and do i get nothing at all you
promised me-

  be still domengos i cut in if we
gave you what you deserve you would get
only a good kicking yet since you have
told the truth we will give you something
worth your while it would do no good to
the vulture



give you money you would only drink it
up but there is much liquor left here
behind the bar and you may have as much
of it as you can carry away at one load
now bend your back and sweat

  he did sweat he got bags and crammed
them with the strongest liquors in the place
working fast for fear we might change our
minds he loaded himself down so that he
could scarcely walk and when he carried
his burden to the door he puffed and stag-
gered and splashed sweat on the floor

  outside he got into a montaria and went
away and it was a long time before any
one again saw him sober

  then after looking at miguel and finding
that his wound was painful but not mortal
and that his girl maria was taking good care
of him pedro and joaquim and i left the
house which no longer was that of the vul-
ture and paddled back to angela

  into her hands pedro put the money tell-
ing her that now she could return to ega or to
santarem as she pleased but after holding
it and staring at it-more money than she
had seenjn all her life-she passed it back
to him

  keep it for me she said i do not-i
do not know that i want to go i-i like
this place better than i did

  we stared at her she dropped her eyes
and looked at the floor glancing at paula
i saw a wise smile grow on her face

  but you must go angela pedro told
her this place is unhealthful in more
ways than one you have been here only a
short time but even now you do not look
so strong as when you came you will be
much more healthy and far more happy at
one of those towns on the great river

  still she gazed at the floor then she

looked shyly up at him and glanced quickly
aside

  santarem and ega are far from here
she said in a small voice i do not want to
travel so far-alone

  he put a hand under her chin and lifted
her face to his a hot blush flamed in her
cheeks but she met his eyes steadily
when he spoke again his voice was very
gentle

  i would go down the river with you
angela but i am not yet ready to leave the
javary i intend to work one more season
on the seringal of the coronet and then to
go out and stay out

  go back to santarem and find vincente
honorio my godfather say to him that
when the next great flood rises i come back
home and that in the meantime he is to
take very good care of you tell him that
i pedro andrada have said this now be
a good girl and do as i say and all will be
well

  she did as he said on the next down
boat she sailed away taking with her the
money he had brought her from the vulture
the memory of all he had done for her and
his promise that in another year he would
come home and with her going remate
de males settled back into his usual habit-
waiting

  our friends the rubber-workers waited
for the time when they could go back to
work in the swampy forests the townsmen
waited for the flood waters to ebb until they
could walk about on dry land and kick the
bones of the vulture out of the street and
pedro and i with a new jug of cachassa
which we knew would not be poisoned
yawned and waited for whatever might
happen next


the prodigal son

by ira south

t you call to mind the scriptural tale
of the roving prodigal son

how it fell he cried for his fathers house
and despaired the thing he had done

         and he rose and made the old dear streams
         which marked the boundary lines
         and a hillcrest broke by a thread of smoke
         all well-remembered signs

          t t is peace returned as he tended the flocks
          - and watching the sunlight gleam
          on the salt-white stones of the homestead walls
          he forgot his broken dream

and he had forgot when he went away

         or had never fully known
         how dear he held a girl who dwelled

          by the fields where the grain was grown

        t ut autumn wore on and winter came

and time was swiftly sped

till a wistful thought arose one day

          desire he believed was dead

         o mother dear say what was done
         with my old knotted staff

         was my patched cloak burned when i returned
         from off the wayside path

         i o hebron came another spring

- to the slopes of lebanon

          again a fathers heart aggrieved

          for again he yearned a son

         this time he took no heritage-

naught but his staff and cloak

         a bolt left drawn and he was gone
         with never a farewell spoke

          ttor he that hath in his restless blood
          some ancient wandering strain
          may dwell content for a season of peace

           but it will rise again

         when the camel-drivers curse and sing
         along the dusty trail

          the old-trod track will call him back
          and nothing may avail


heres the start of a camp-fire station
and club in winnipeg canada com-
rade peterson wants any of you in or near
there to get into touch with him

winnipeg manitoba canada

  mr a s mcnamee and the writer both situated
in winnipeg for how long only kismet knows-at
least anyhow until the call of the wild claims
us-would like to light a big camp-fire in this
northern metropolis but local advertising has not
revealed any adventurers or ttts so if you
would do us the favor to insert an invitation for
a rally around the camp-fire to be lit and kept
burning in winnipeg man in the camp-fire sec-
tion of the next possible adventure issued we would
be pleased to organize a camp-fire club here with
all refinements and accommodations possible this
winnipeg camp-fire open to active local and cor-
responding members membership fees only to
cover actual expense in upkeep any one interested
please address the undersigned-walter peter-
son  kennedy st

	i he station idea is taking hold slowly
but surely and it is better that way
once more here is the explanation of the
plan and a list-larger than last time-of
those who have definitely undertaken
stations

  a station may be in any shop home or other
reputable place the only requirements are that a
station shall display the regular station sign provide
a box or drawer for mail to be called for and provide
and preserve a sufficiently substantial register book
when there are enough stations to warrant even a
small order this office will furnish the books and signs

  no responsibility for mail is assumed by anybody
the station merely uses ordinary care entries in
register to be confined to name or serial number
route destination permanent address and such other
brief notes or remarks as desired each station can
impose its own limit on space to be used registers
become permanent property of station signs remain
property of this magazine so that if there is due
cause of complaint from members a station can be
discontinued by withdrawing sign

 station bulletin-board is strongly to be rec-
ommended as almost necessary on it travelers
can leave tips as to conditions of trails etc resident
members can post their names and addresses such
hospitality as they care to offer calls for any travel-
ers who are familiar with countries these residents
once knew calls for particular men if they happen
that way etc notices or tips about local facilities
and conditions letters to resident members can
be posted on this bulletin-board

  any one who wishes is a member of camp-fire
and therefore entitled to the above station privileges
question of requiring identification-cards or camp-
fire button to be decided later those offering
hospitality of any kind do so on their own respon-
sibility and at their own risk and can therefore
make any discriminations they see fit travel-
ing members will naturally be expected to re-
member that they arc merely guests and act ac-
cordingly

  a station may offer only the required register and
mail facilities or enlarge its scope to any degree it
pleases its possibilities as headquarters for a local
club of resident camp-fire members is excellent

weve made a point of keeping our
camp-fire discussions away from
religion but since one of our off-the-trail
stories brought up the subject not of creed
dogma or sectarianism but of elemental
religion lets have this letter from one of
our comrades

    personally im the more inclined to make
 this exception because i believe that most
 of the present world trouble is due to too
 much materialism and that most of us need
 to look at the other side of things more than
 weve been doing no im not a preacher
 any more than comrade merrill is-have

 been to church only once in ten or twelve
 years-but im not one of the bright little
 fellows who think they have brains enough
 to prove there is no god as a matter
 of fact i think brains have much less to do
 with solving the problem either way than
 we are likely to think they have-other-
 wise a fellows chance of finding god would
 be directly dependent upon the amount
 of brains he happened to have which is
 unfair and impossible my own experience
 has been similar to comrade merrills and
 i dare say lots more of you are in the same
 boat

  no were not going to let camp-fire fall
to squabbling about even elementary re-
ligion still less about any creeds or dogmas
but i believe that what comrade merrill
says should be said so that all of us can hear
it and each fellow do his own thinking

  as to calling edgar youngs the master
plotter an off-the-trail story we did so
because it differs from our usual stories in
that it brings up this very question of re-
ligion and because it is more psychological
in nature than are most of our stories

st albans vermont

  why do you asterisk the master plotter by
edgar young in august rd issue as off-the-trail
sure mr man its very much on the trail the
true trail of life experience reveals if you dont
know it you ought to and sure will some day good
luck to you ill gamble that edgar young has
stacked up against the vicissitudes of life and prof-
ited by the lessons taught more power to him

t bucked up against the master plotter nigh

   two score of years thought myself smarty en-
ough to outwit him at other times strenuously
endeavored to persuade myself there is no him but
always got beautifully licked thought once or
twice i was going to get by and deceive him but
no use-it was only a lull before a storm and i got
knocked out good and plenty came mighty near
going over the great divide to get what might be
coming to me there but he knew best and gave
me another chance

   about a score of years ago took a tumble to my
damfoolishness and weary of stacking up agin a
losing game was first neutral and passive then
turned to and fought with instead of against him
began to make good at once and have been climb-
ing up ever since

  he is a winner we can not deceive him the
master plotter gives us a square deal every time
and its up to us to play the hand he deals for all
its worth and believe me its some hand you
can use this anyway anywhere any time you wish

   i dont like notoriety but worit duck it if it will
do any one any good-f o merrill

   p s maybe this is an off-the-trail letter
but for the love of mike dont size me up for a
preacher usterbe called doc and other things
-f o m
the camp-fire



concerning his story in this issue a
word from arthur o friel and a news-
paper clipping mr friel didnt mention
the year of the clipping but his letter en-
closing it was dated april  

  this story gives lourenfo and pedro further
adventures after their return to the headquarters of
the coroncl the town of remate de males where
these experiences take place is a real town on the
javary about thirty miles up from the solimoes
amazon where the rubber-workers of the region
gather during the high floods

  although it really hasnt much to do with the
urubu of this tale im sending along a news story
in connection with it which is quite graphically told
and out of the usual run of news dispatches may-
be its worth a camp-fire note maybe not
anyway its interesting-arthur o friel

  here is the clipping an interesting story
on its own account quite apart from haunt-
ing vultures

  miami fla sept -many hours before the
storm which sunk the ward liner corydon in the
bahamas channel tuesday morning with a loss of
twenty-seven lives a vulture followed the ship and
perched on her spars while a panic-stricken crew
believing in the superstitions of the sea were con-
vinced that they were doomed

  such is the story brought here by eight of the crew
who were  hours adrift on an upturned boat
battered and bruised and without food or water

  all day sunday as the ship pursued her way in
calm seas and light winds the great bird hovered
overhead

  sunday night and monday the corydon staggered
through the smashing seas monday night every
member of the crew was engaged in a desperate
battle for life

  there was no food as the galley and  revision
rooms were flooded tuesday morning they lost
control of the ship the wireless apparatus was short-
circuited and no s o s calls could be sent out

  when the vessel went under the americans in the
crew kept their heads and saved the lives of some
others of the thirty-six

  i slid against a lifeboat and clung to it when the
corydon listed said one of the survivors the
lifeboat and i shot into the sea together luckily it
landed rightside up and i got in all the oars were
lashed to it

  nine other men got into the lifeboat and a few
moments afterward the corydon went down al-
most immediately the seas capsized the lifeboat
three times as fast as the men could dive from under
it and right it again they lashed themselves to
the seats with strips of clothing

  third mate mallowes told a graphic story of his
battle with john condron a greco-american sea-
man when he became crazed by privation and fear
i held him all of the first day and night said
mallowes

  he was raving crazy he got violent and tried
to draw a stiletto i tied him to the boat then
when i became so weak i could do nothing with him
and when he got a chance he threw himself over-
board and was drowned

  noticed a line from mr tuttle on a rabbit not
needing guts supported by an incident relating to
same had a similar experience with a jack on
the head of wind river wyoming in the spring of
 i have told it to many and been given the raz
in each instance shot a large jack with a  caliber
colt hitting him in the hind leg breaking same
and tearing the bottom of his stomach so that his
insides pretty nearly all came out it started off on
a slow lope and one of the fellows with me caught it
kicking it on the back of the head several times to
put it out of miseryr same seemed to revive it for
when laid down it jumped up and made os through
the brush at a tremendous rate squealing like a pig
at ringing-time it mounted a rise about a quarter
of a mile away and disappeared still going strong
never saw anything like it we followed it for some
distance but lost track of it in the brush and never
did find it some rabbit glad to hear a man whose
word carries some weight put forth a tale to more
than support mine-wm d leetch

when i received the following letter
from g l chester it sounded as if
lamona was likely to stir up quite a discus-
sion so i thought it might be well to start
things off with scientific dope from the best
authorities and their letters follow mr
chesters

  the members of the caucus have discussed nearly
everything under the sun and seem to know every-
thing so i ask them to inform me just what drug
is contained in the weed found all over california
and arizona and probably elsewhere known to the
spanish inhabitants as lamona and to the en-
glish speaking as dove-weed or turkey mullein
it is a low growing semi-running plant with foliage
of a peculiar gray color growing mostly in sandy
soil and bearing a very small black seed its medic-
inal peculiarity lies in its fly-repelling power a
few bunches hung near fresh meat will protect the
meat from blow-flies while a boiled tincture is
sure death to fly maggots in wounds on animals
besides being very cleansing and healing the vines
and leaves gathered in piles and then beaten to chaff
with poles and scattered in water with little or no
current will cause every fish in the water to come to
the top belly up so they may be taken by hand
and eaten without consequence this last was
about the most popular method of fishing pursued
by the indians in the central valleys of california

  replying to your letter i would state that the
weed described in the letter of mr g l chester
which you enclosed is eremocarpus sctigerus or
turkey mullein the facts as described by mr
chester are borne out in the testimony of various
writers in addition the plant is a dangerous one
in pastures as it has long hairs on its stems which


adventure

form hair-balls in the stomachs of stock just what
drug principle is contained i am unable to find out
but presume it is similar to that contained in the
castor-oil plant and croton to both of which it is
closely related-department of agriculture by

  the following account of this plant quoted from
contributions from the u s national her-
barium vol  no  pp -  will give
you the information desired

proton setigerus hook-shaunt pomo-a
very low gray weed native to california and
popularly known as turkey mullein some au-
thors give it the technical name eremocarpus setig-
erus it grows abundantly in black adobe soil
eveywhere throughout the open country from july
to november and is very conspicuous on account of
its dainty mat-like appearance its circular out-
lines are very prettily arranged in flat leafy rosettes
the white bristly hairs which cover the whole plant
in the greatest profusion are very characteristic
each bristle being a part of a compound hair
which radiates outward from the leaf in all direc-
tions both the flowers and the fruit are incon-
spicuous

  the shining bean-like seeds only a sixth of an
inch long are borne in great abundance and in the
summer and autumn constitute one of the favorite
foods of the wild mourning dove which flocks to
localities where the plant is particularly abundant
a circumstance which the indians take advantage
of in order to kill them in large numbers for food
turkeys feed on the seed also and on this account
and on account of the wooly mullein-like appear-
ance of the leaf the plant has been called turkey
mullein

  the indian name above given signifies fish soap-
root for as the name implies the bruised leaves
are used as a substitute for soaproot in the process
of catching fish by stupefying or poisoning them
it is hardly inferior to soaproot for catching fish
but this use has not been known to some of the
tribes especially the yokia and pomo for so long a
time having been taught to them in this instance by
more southern tribes the early spaniards were
well acquainted with the use of this plant and
therefore called it yerba del pescado the fishing
herb

  a recent popular name which suggests the intoxi-
cating action of the plant is fish locoweed

the plant is altogether too commonly used both
by the indians and whites for catching fish it
is used in precisely the same manner as is described
under chlorogalum pomeridianum the exact cause
of the stupefying or crazing effect is not known
some indians attribute it to the stellate hairs
which they say attach themselves to the eyes and
gills and make them frantic if these should be-
come thus attached they would undoubtedly cause
great distress but the chemical qualities of the plant
may easily account for the effect not only is the
odor very strong but the taste is exceedingly acrid
as it is in most of the members of the spurge family
to which it belongs a cursory examination of the
eyes and gills of fish caught by means of the

plant would probably settle the question for the
stellate hairs are exceedingly characteristic of the
plant

  the concow are particularly acquainted with the
plant and use it for medicinal purposes as well as
for catching fish the fresh leaves are bruised and
applied to the chest as a counter-irritant poultice for
internal pain a decoction of the plant or some of
the fresh leaves is put into warm water which is
used as a bath in typhoid and other fevers and a
weak decoction is taken internally as a cure for
chills and fever white people sometimes use it for
the latter purpose but so far as known it has not
yet been widely used in such a way the yuki

one of our old-timers pays a fine tribute
to calamity jane and tells us some in-
teresting things about her i know youll
join me in asking h w h to tell us still
more about those interesting times

  i read a letter in camp-fire about calamity jane
i want to say that a better-hearted woman never
lived than this same calamity jane true name
jane carey

t was carrying dispatches all through the sioux
war of - and i was deputy u s marshal
in the black hills country for years and i have sen
most of the old-timers of that period calamity jane
among the rest i have seen her dressed in mens
clothes and driving a ten-mule team on the freight
road from cheyenne to dead wood and i have seen
her dressed in silks in the dance halls of deadwood
she used to drink some at times and she was a
sporting woman and lived a life that was all wrong
but i dont believe she ever did a dishonest act in
her life

  i was in the old bellunion hall when wild bill
william hickok was shot and jane was the first
one to reach him and he died in her arms

tn the winter of  times were very hard for
the men that drifted into deadwood from the
hills and many a man whould have gone hungry if
it had not been for calamity jane she owned a
house in elizabethtown the lower end of main
st deadwood and furnished foodand bedding for
at least ten men all winter and i know at times
there were twice that number living there the men
had to rustle their own wood and do their own cook-
ing but jane furnished the house and paid the bills
she hardly ever went down to the house but she
saw that there was plenty of food for any one that
was broke and she worked all winter in the dance
halls to pay for it

  i know of a number of cases where she gave the
last cent she had to help out some one in hard luck
she never was a scout but as i said before i have
seen her driving an-mule team she used to stay
in the camps in the winter but liked to be out in
the open air in the summer time

  she died at tombstone arizona

  and my hat is off to the memory of the biggest-
hearted woman that ever followed the mining camps
in the early days-h w h

tt t most of us have a general idea

	of what that means but here comes
edgar young with pretty full data it is
a letter he wrote to one of you in his
ask adventure capacity

	brooklyn

  just when this expression originated would be
hard to say my knowledge of the american trop-
ics extends back some  years when as a young lad
i first crossed over into old mexico and the expres-
sion was current at that time men in the tropics
americans used the initials t t t in speaking of
certain types of men and only used the words
typical tropical tramp to explain to a newcomer
when he asked what t t t meant possibly
the expression could not be traced back to its
origin as is the case with the word boomer for
itinerant railroader which is in current use through-
out the west and has been for twenty years

  last winter a t t t whom i knew in mexico
ecuador panama and costa rica called on me and
we were talking about the origin of the expression
he is much older than i and was in guatemala
during the construction of the northern railroad
from puerto barrios to the capital according to
his explanation ed burke tried to organize the
roaming americans and english-speaking foreigners
who traveled from job to job into a society for mu-
tual aid this society was called the typical
tropical tramps a lot of secret works were
drawn up and a badge bearing the letters t t t
ordered from the u s later in a conversation
with a man who was in costa rica in  and who
has a couple of immense albums of photos taken at
that time he told me that the expression was in use
when he first landed in costa rica both stories
are possibly true burke may have used the
existing expression to draw up the society
whether it is a fact or not that hundreds of men
have been called t t ts before this time it is true
that hundreds have since been called that without
having gone through any initiation ceremony

gtrange as it may appear it is a compli-
mentary title it means that a man is an all-
around good fellow who has traveled over the
tropics from end to end and will share his last cent
with any white man he meets up with down there
about the first question a t t t asks a man when
he arrives is howre you fixed on receiving an
answer that the newcomer hasnt eaten lately or is
short of money the t t t proceeds to shell out
part or all of his roll his pie-card digs out his best
suit and gives it up or borrows one that will fit the
newcomer shares his room introduces the recien
llegado newly arrived to the bunch vouches for
him to the boss if he wants a job and if he doesnt
want one and wants to travel to the next camp where
white men work squares him with a railroad con-
ductor or buys him a ticket he may never have
seen the man before in his life and may never see him
again he does not expect a cent in return he
figures by the endless chain that some one will
do the same for him some time and the chances are
 to  that the man he has helped will get the
opportunity to return the favor at some future time

jt is unbelievable that such men exist in this
selfish world they exist by the hundreds and
it is only a case of going to any white camp in

central america mexico and the northern part of
s a and down the west coast into the copper and
gold camps of peru and chile to find them they
are not very frequent on the east coast of s a after
passing venezuela and although a rare t t t is to
be found in brazil and argentine the expression is
not often heard many of them were up the ama-
zon during the construction of the madeira-mamore
when wages were  and room per month for
either a locomotive engineer or a clerk in the office
the bunch who went were lured by the high prices
paid in all lines and the adventure a job of this kind
offered this was a very unhealthy place many
died with fever and beri-beri in  and 
among them ed burke who was acting as chief
dispatcher at the time

    ow it happens that a white man loses caste if he
labors in a low capacity in latin america he
is always employed as a boss of some kind if he is
employed as a machinist he is given a couple of
yellow indian or black west indian helpers and he
is supposed to oversee them and make them do the
work anything that can be done by these cheaper
laborers is done in this manner a man does not
lose caste for doing work they can not learn to do
such as running a locomotive or similar work but he
is not supposed to do work they can do this may
appear foolish but it is very sensible long before
the war a white american would not consider less
than  and free quarters he was a high-priced
man if this man did the work of a twenty-five
ccnts per day native he was appearing at a disad-
vantage on the job he lost the respect of his
fellows and also strange to say the respect of the
native people

tn connection with this it is well to state
that the better class in latin america of the
native people never work with their hands they
produce some fine artists great writers excellent
politicians many army officers a multitude of in-
spired poets no jest this but produce no mechani-
cal geniuses factory managers or other practical
men the entire bunch of latin american coun-
tries are forced to call in foreigners to run their
machinery railroads factories etc in brazil a
man capable of installing a small briquetting plant
cotton mill or similar work is known by the title of
doctor the brazilian thinks a man capable of
doing things of this kind is wonderful he is intro-
duced into the clubs and complimented in the daily
papers among all the foreigners who come to
brazil an american is the most popular just to let
it be known that a man is an american means to a
brazilian that they have a man capable of doing
everything

  they themselves are wonderful in their own lines
they can tell more about coffee in one minute by
pouring a teaspoonful of it on a saucer and watching
the stain it makes than any americacan find out in
a lifetime they know rubber through all its
grades they know many other things they
have the most wonderful country on the face of the
world and the most money to spend but a bra-
zilian couldnt begin to put a ribbon on a typewriter

  to a less extent this holds good through all the
countries from the rio grande to cape horn
mexico is possibly the exception many mexican
firemen have become engineers and many bra-
queros have become conductors also others have
i

adventure

learned until mexico can almost do her own work
but these have been peons who have learned the
higher caste have never tried to learn manual work
of any kind and look down on a man who does it
gradually an american begins to shun working
with his hands if he has begun it when he first ar-
rived he figures he is as good as the better class of

native people finally he decides he is a-sight

better than the better class and is really reckoned by
them as such it is possibly for this reason that he
feels called on to help any fellow countryman who
arrives broke no i wont say that either it
isnt that its just good fellowship its a sort of
ethics that has been assumed by t t ts its the
custom everybody does it and a man falls into the
habit i guess

  i arrived over the trail from mexico in guate-
mala city a pretty hard looking specimen that
night a man called me aside and gave me  his
name was shaunessy and he had arrived over the
same trail a few months before the master
mechanic gave me  a few nights later he want-
ed to give me all he had and we compromised on the
 ed burke wired me  i went to panama
and got a chance to stake two of them in return i
hired a hack and took the best meal down to the
quarantine station in colon that ever went in the
gate shaunessy did not arrive he died on the
trail between guatemala and honduras if he had
arrived in panama i would have gone broke on him
for he was a good guy thats the way it goes
they stake you and you stake them or some one
else and he stakes them further down the creek as
the expression goes

jyjost of them are high-class men they run
from men who have managed railroads down to
clerks and telegraph operators their feet are itchy
as a rule they do not remain very long but they
are competent and can handle the job while they do
work ed burke who has been general manager of
every railroad in central america used to blow up
hit the trail several hundred miles and blow in look-
ing like a vagabond on the next job he was a
wonderful man in more respects than one-could
possibly be called the king of the t t t
flood was another big man of the clan a man
gave him  when he passed through tehuantepec
walking to the zone i personally know that it
cost him over  to buy this same man out of
jail in panama for accidentally murdering a gambler
with a tap on the temple the gambler had a
paper or rotten skull

  abont all that is required to be a t t t is to
hit a few trails and arrive at some mine or railroad
job broke they will see that you are looked after
and then you will be doing the same thing yourself
if you cant help the one who helped you you will
help some one who will and it wifi finally get
back to him law of compensation some one
started doing it years ago i wish i knew who
he was id get the t t ts to build him a
monument

  incidentally some of the men who first come
down contract stiffs speak sneeringly of the
t t t many of them later hit the trail and
become among the best of the typical tropical
tramps heres to em best bunch in the
world if i wasnt sleepy id fan this type-

-edgar young

	i his will stir things up a bit t s miller
of our a a department asks us to -
settle this matter of the derivation of the
word gringo

                            monterey co cal

  can any reader of camp-fire furnish any in-
formation regarding the origin of the term gringo
perhaps edgar young whose intimacy with mexico
and central america one envies can add to the
many curious and wild explanations of this word
which is beginning to become a bugbear to me i
can not number the verbal and written queries i
have received as to the origin of this word per-
haps it is merely the fascination of mystery any-
way gringo seems to be one of those insolvable
mysteries

a bout a year ago a compiler of a latin-american
dictionary writing from lima sought informa-
tion on this word through the ask adventure ser-
vice i was unable to give him much satisfaction
he seemed to think gringo originated in africa
he wrote that though in south america generally
the word is gringo in venezuela they say gurun-
go which latter he traces to the african um--
ungo meaning the white man if that is so
um-l-ungo does not come from west africa at
least i never met it there but he speculates that
gur signifies red sil resulte que gur signifie
rouge complexion sanguine rubicund nous du-
rons lexplication du terme gringo signifie homme
rubicund he writes

   his view is novel to me but probably more plausi-
ble than the common belief of the southwest as to
the origin of gringo which so the story runs
originated through the fact that the englishmen
began to arrive in mexico about the time of the pojt
ularity of the song green grow the rushes o 
that the mexicans heard this song ever on the lip 
of the englishmen and took its two first words or a
they understood those words for gringo as th
name of the whites an old lexicon gives the wore
as a mexican term of contempt for whites but fur-
nishes no derivation of the word nor its relationship
to contempt-t s miller

another belated letter drawn at ran-

least he came through unscathed perhaps
if he sees this hell drop camp-fire a line by
way of report

  im going after these old letters in our
camp-fire cache some gain in interest
by delay but in other cases we lose by it
after this ill try not to let them he so long
though our camp-fire letters pile up so
that our space cant keep up with them

  though camp-fire is not a place for

in the following since naturally that offer

could not hold at this late day and in these
high-priced times

                            vancouver b c

   i have been taking adventure for three years now
through a newsdealer in st johns n f the near-
est large town to labrador where i have my home
but am now leaving for siberia

t noticed in st november issue  answer
by r s spears to question re kajacks
as the esquimaux in labrador still use kyacks
and i am somewhat familiar with them may i
offer a few details the kyacks of greenland
baffin land hudson bay and ungava bay and
labrador are all built on similar plan but differ in
the various localities mentioned such differences
however are so slight as to be apparent to experts
only bones are only used in the frames in those
places where wood is not procurable and the seal-
skin covering is put on in such a condition that it
shrinks tightly over the frame

  in labrador many natives now use canoe canvas
instead of sealskin for a covering owing to the fact
that seals are scarcer than formerly and the skin
necessary to cover a kyack will bring in the local
trading stores enough returns to buy sufficient
canvas and other articles as well sealskin how-
ever is considered better than canvas in southern
labrador the kyack is rarely seen in the north-
say from nain north-it is seen in increasing num-
bers as one gets away from civilization and means
of buying sailboats and motorboats contrary to
mr spearss statement a kyack can be used safely
by any white man used to canoes it is true they
are cranky boats but i have seen quite a few white
men tackle them with success though of course it
takes years to use them like the natives do

   if your correspondent who asks the questions re
kyacks wishes to buy one i could manage to sell
him a full-sized hunting model for  complete
with paddles harpoon float bladder etc delivered
in st johns n f-pte r white

there are quite a lot of us in the u s
n and i have no doubt some of you
are pretty sure to remember this scrap on

the chicago

                   the receiving station

                                 philadelphia pa
the last time i wrote you i had just got under
way on the chicago for the republica de colombia
which cruise never wound up until we hit cuba
barbadoes bahia brazil and last but not least the
place i often read of in adventure rio de janeiro
and i sure got mine going over the line i cant re-
member the name of the different writers who gave
us the dope on south america but i feel a special
interest in all of them now that i have been there
 particularly the fellow who faked and dropped the
bottle overboard en route from barbadoes to bahia
as i traveled that course coming back we stopped
in at port o spain trinidad and i had the oppor-
tunity of going through the leper settlement and
meeting the sisters who conduct it

t also read what some one wrote regarding the
fight that was staged on one of the old sailing
packets and particularly noticed what he said about
the way the cops would stop such a thing to-day i

wish you would let a little of this be published in
camp-fire and see if any of the old gang can re-
member the focsle fight that was staged by one
muckles reilly boatswains mate first-class 
the u s s chicago i wont say this battle lasted
all day but it was some scrap some of the crew
if they read it will remember the battle and i can
produce proof in the way of photographs which a
calm collected gob snapshotted while it was under
way i think if this gentleman had seen that battle
he would appreciate that the gobs of to-day have
not deteriorated or lost any of their battling
ability

  of course some doubters will say where were
the officers of the ship that is a mystery but the
photos show the men going at it stripped to the
waist with their bodies pretty well covered with
gore muckles reilly is still aboard the chicago

iiile the departments are excluded from the

for
democracy

ouppose that in your town such posters as the
following met the citizens eyes wherever they
turned during the days just preceding an election
thats what is done in grand rapids michigan by
the local americanization society  shepard
bldg frank l dykema secretary as you know
they actually teach practical american citizenship
in the schools of grand rapids

  the results of these posters and the campaign of
which they are a part richly proved the practical
value of the work so would it in any other
american city or town

  and isnt pretty good americanism being taught
there

  here are the posters the last sentence of the
first poster appeared also on all the others

mothers and fathers

make the children good citizens by setting them the
example of good citizenship you cant neglect
your duty and expect them to respect theirs any
more than you can be dishonest and expect them
to be honest

vote aug -am so

tell the aliens to go to the clerk of the superior
court or to the county clerk to take out their
citizenship papers

get this

if nobody voted there would be no government
thats what the anarchist wants if you
dont vote aug st you are playing the anarchists
game for him-am so

election day keep yours by voting aug -
am so

                vote early aug 

when you meet a man or woman look them in the
eye-theyll know what you mean if they have
not voted they will feel like a plugged nickel but
be right yourself vote early-am so

women

voting isnt a privilege-it is a duty that every
citizen owes to every other citizen it is your moral
obligation vote au -am so

stop thief

dont steal your childrens liberties by failing t
maintain your government when you fail to vo
you are robbing them be honest vote augu
st-am so

sure

you would fight for the united states if it were
necessary but your ballot is just as important in
fighting the enemies of self-government as bullets
were in war vote aug -am so

                the only difference

between a man or woman who does not vote and an
anarchist is that the non-voter destroys the govern-
ment more slowly than the anarchist dont be in
the anarchist class vote aug -am so

think

a mother

trains her children in honesty and fair dealing by
example a mother who fails in her duty as a
citizen is not setting a good example for her children
women vote aug st its a duty-am so

x honorable men

and women keep their engagements every
citizen has an engagement with his government on

what it would mean to you and your children if

a birds-eye view of central america

the spring that runs blood-where the sun rises out of the
pacific and sets in the atlantic

by edgar young

roughly speaking taking a birds-eye
view of the general outline of central
 america it is hard to describe it is
the lower extension of the north american
continent running in a southeasterly direc-
tion decreasing in width down to the re-
public of panama where it terminates in
the form of a horseshoe with the heels spread
wide apart and the toe of the shoe pointed
north

  a portion of the pacific ocean south of
panama is both east and west of the at-
lantic panama canal zone runs almost
north and south in fact panama city is
southeast of colon

  the republic of panama shown on a
map by itself bears a remarkable likeness
to a gigantic measuring-worm headed west
from a point near the middle of the atlantic
coast of the republic the rest of the land is
either south southeast or southwest from
there nothing could be more at variance
with the facts than the current belief in the
united states that this republic runs north
and south and the canal zone runs east and
west the sun rises out of the pacific and
sets in the atlantic to persons on the canal
zone

  central america is not a flat low-lying
stretch of land it is a mountainous coun-
try with rugged mountains some of which
are capped with eternal show the low
country consists of the coastal plains for
the most part on the atlantic side

  the height of land is nearer the pacific
side than the atlantic the slope dropping
more abruptly to the pacific and more grad-
ually to the atlantic this is very general
for there are off-shooting spur ranges in both
directions from the main backbone some of
which as in southern guatemala and north-
ern honduras extend all the way to the
atlantic and in salvador all the way to the
pacific

  this main backbone range is part of the
pan-american or rocky-andean chain that
extends from alaska to the extreme end of
south america finding their lowest height

in panama and their highest in certain
peaks in south america it is a fact that
the mountains of central america in pre-
historic times rose to an immense height

  the general topography of the country is
due to the heavier rainfall on the atlantic
than on the pacific side when these moun-
tains were too high to allow passage of rain-
laden clouds which is a prevailing condition
in certain portions of south america today

  from undeniable indications eastern hon-
duras and eastern nicaragua were formed
by the filling up of the sea with material
brought down from the mountains by ero-
sion panama was formed by the wearing
down of a chain of islands that connected
the continents of north and south america
and the other republics of costa rica sal-
vador and guatemala by a gradual wearing
down of the main backbone range and off-
shooting spurs

  examination of some of the highest hills
in the coastal plains shows them to be of vol-
canic origin these were islands before the
sea was filled in around them from the
soil of the surrounding plain fossils of ex-
tinct sea denizens have been-dug up such
as sharks teeth measuring several inches in
diameter skeletons etc

  the rivers as general rule empty into the
atlantic the number and size in so small
a territory is a source of surprize to a new-
comer along the coasts principally on the
atlantic among the deltas of these rivers
are to be found numerous lagoons some of
which are very extensive in size many
are barely separated from the sea and are
salt or brackish others are really lakes of
fresh water lying back several miles from the
sea and connected with it by a small outlet

  in the interior there are many high-lying
crater lakes of various sizes and at various
altitudes the principal lake of central
america however in point of size is lake
nicaragua or gran lago this lake lies in
the pacific half of nicaragua-an immense
body of water connected with the atlantic
by the largest and most important river of

adventure

central america the san juan and with
lake managua a much smaller lake lying
in front of the capital by a shallow creek
locally called tipitapi estero through which
boats of very light draft have passed the
surface of these two lakes is between a hun-
dred and twenty-five and a hundred and
thirty feet above sea-level

  in point of importance the artificial lake
of gatun made by the americans during
the construction of the panama canal far
excels any other this lake of some hun-
dred and seventy square miles in extent and
lying about eighty feet above sea-level was
formed by placing a dam between two
mountains and confining the waters of the
chagres and several other small rivers
over its surface passes an ever-increasing
portion of the worlds commerce finding its
way up from the sea and down again into
the sea by means of huge concrete locks
near both ends of the canal

  volcanos-there are more than eighty
volcanos in central america many of which
are active others in formation and others
extinct the principal ones are

  guatemala tucana tajumulco santa
maria san pedro atitlan agua fuego
acatenango pacaya suchitan

  salvador san vicente san salvador
san miguel santa ana izalco conchagua

  nicaragua cosiguina viejo telica
momotombo masaya mambacho ome-
tepe madera

  costa rica ravolo blanco turrialba
orosi irazu 

  panama chiriqui

  the other smaller ones are distributed
among guatemala salvador nicaragua and
costa rica honduras is free from vol-
canos and the volcanos of panama have
been extinct for untold centuries

  rivers-the principal rivers are as
follows

  emptying into the atlantic

  guatemala motagua polochic sars-
tun umacinla

  honduras chamelecon ulua lean
aguan tiato patuca

  nicaragua wanks grande bluefields
mico prinzapolka san juan

  costa rica san carlos sarapiqui

  emptying into the pacific

  nicaragua rio grande de tola

  panama tuyra

  between guatemala and salvador
paz

 between salvador and honduras
goascoran

  salvador lempa grande

  honduras choluteca

  lakes-the gran lago of nicaragua is
ninety-five miles long by thirty-five miles
wide lake managua is thirty miles long
by fifteen wide their altitude above sea-
level is variously stated at from one hundred
twenty-eight to one hundred thirty-five
both are navigable but the shallow creek
that connects them can be negotiated only
by light-draft vessels and with some
difficulty by them

  the san juan river the most important
river of central america connects lake
nicaragua with the atlantic a regular
freight and passenger service is in operation
from the atlantic to the city of granada on
the lake this city is connected with the
pacific by railroad which passes through the
capital managua and terminates at the
port of corinto

  other principal lakes of central america
are as follows

  guatemala izabal peten atitlan
amatitlan

  salvador ilopango

  honduras yojoa

  costa rica sierpe san carlos manati

 panama  gatun	

 between salvador and guatemala
guija	f

  springs-there is a multitude of medic-
inal and thermal springs in various parts f
the several countries which with a couple of
exceptions are unexploited they are es-
pecially numerous in the volcanic regions of
salvador guatemala and costa rica

 however the far-famed spring of
blood or fuente de sangre is located
in the department of gracias in honduras
a little to the south of the village of la
virtud this water very closely resembles
blood in color and formation it is said
to be eagerly devoured by dogs and
other animals as well as by bats and
vampires

  several americans and europeans have
tried to carry away samples to be analyzed
but on being confined the water decom-
poses and bursts the containers the wa-
ter is possibly formed by a combination of
vegetable and mineral substances formed
either before or after it seeps into the cavern
from which it issues the superstitious in-
habitants of la virtud accept the easier
a birds-eye view of central america



hypothesis that it is blood and human
blood at that

  seasons-it is rather hard when one first
arrives in central america to understand
the seasons the verano or summer begins
in november and ends in may may to
october the invierno or winter is the
rainy season and the coolest for that
reason

  it must not be understood by this that it
rains all the time rains fall during the
rainy season at frequent intervals for
several weeks they will fall in daytime lit-
eral downpours of almost clock-like regu-
larity and it will clear up at night and the
stars come out then it will change and
rain at night for several weeks and be clear
in daytime

  during this rainy season the roads be-
come quite muddy where they are unpaved
as they do in any other country um-
brellas rubber coats and ponchos are used
to keep dry when traveling

  a great deal has been said about the rainy
season in central america say what you
will it is much to be preferred to the cold
rain sleet ice and snow of this country
during winter especially along the north
atlantic coast

  the rainy and dry seasons are sharply
divided on the pacific slope but on the at-
lantic side it often rains during the dry sea-
son and in places the actual dry season as
in panama canal zone consists of the
months of january to april inclusive on
an average the rainfall is about double on
the atlantic side of what it is on the
pacific bearing a proportion of about one
hundred and twenty inches to sixty taking
both coasts on an average

  temperature-generally speaking the
temperature drops four degrees for every
one thousand feet of ascent into the high-
lands of all the central american countries
a man can actually suffer from cold in the
highlands of any of them

  the best climate for an american or
white european is to be found at an altitude
of from three thousand to four thousand
five hundred feet above that it becomes
steadily colder

  upon the beach of the atlantic coast a
heavy sea breeze blows constantly but in
the lowlands back in the jungle where this
breeze can not come it is very humid and
warm not so warm according to the ther-
mometer but warm to be felt and suffered

with however at night it drops until a
man will reach for his blanket

  the hottest time of the day has probably
been eighty-nine degrees and the coolest
part of the night fifty-five degrees accord-
ing to a thermometer the rainfall on a
low strip along the atlantic coast all the
way from mexico to colombia is the worst
thing to contend with on this side but it
makes ideal banana weather one can not
have everything

  the climate of the highlands is not unlike
northern californias but there is more vege-
tation to be seen the temperature rarely
climbs beyond eighty-four fahrenheit and
seldom drops below fifty fahrenheit unless
one is on top of some high mountain when
colder weather will be experienced

  at places strawberries may be had every
day in the year

  health-there is quite a lot of malaria
to be found along the atlantic coast and to a
less degree along the lowlands of the pacific
coast similar to that prevailing in the low
bottoms of the mississippi river the
swamps of louisiana eastern texas and
other states of this country other dis-
eases occur in about the same proportion as
they do in this country and the average
native fives under less sanitary conditions

  the malarial germ is carried by a certain
species of mosquito the anopheles a mos-
quito which has a couple of white spots on
each wing white bands on its legs and
stands on its head when it bites only the
female attacks man the bill of the male
being too flimsy to puncture the skin

  as soon as the female is hatched she im-
mediately smells out the nearest human
being or animal and starts to feed upon it
she must have blood before she can lay her
eggs

  the aedes calopus formerly called stego-
myiafascmta is a species of mosquito marked
upon the back with what appears to be the
diagram of a jews-harp and with certain
stripes upon its legs they can carry yellow
fever only when it exists in a district they
bite the patient and at the end of nine days
they have developed the fever then they
inject it into healthy persons whom they
bite there is very little if any yellow
fever this side of guayaquil ecuador at
present

  the culex a black mosquito was formerly
supposed to be harmless except for the usual
irritating effects of insect bites but now it is


adventure

accused of carrying the germ of elephan-
tiasis if not of other diseases

  there are many varieties of these three
general classes to be found in the lowlands
they have been mans enemy in the tropics
from time immemorial and many millions of
deaths may be laid at their doors

  it is a comparatively easy matter to be
rid of them and with small expense what
has been done in panama can be done along
the coasts of central america a book
written by le prince and orenstein and
published by g p putnams sons 
called mosquito control in panama tells
how it was done on the zone by the sanitary
squad of the united states government

  away from the coasts and up above an al-
titude of one thousand feet the mosquitoes
becomes rarer and rarer in places cover-
ing many thousand square miles they are
absolutely unknown

  other insect pests-the principal
other pests to be found in certain districts
are sand-fleas chiggers ticks lice bedbugs
and gnats all of which may be found in cer-
tain districts in the united states the
usual manner of combating sand-fleas is re-
sorted to the chigger will not bury under
the nails of ones feet if ordinary precaution
is taken to keep them clean ticks when
found upon the body are removed by press-
ing a ball of wax on them the others are
combated in the usual manner

  the itching caused by many tick-bites is
very aanoying there are places covered
by underbrush where many may be brushed
off in passing and find their way to the skin
when this land is cleared of underbrush
these ticks disappear ammonia will allay
the itching

   an occasional alacran or scorpion is to be
found its bite is very painful but not
fatal now and then a centipede or taran-
tula is encountered these are so rare as
to be almost negligible

  house-flies numerous other flies and
bugs insects and beetles most of which we
have a knowledge of in this country exist in
central america

  ordinary precautions-drinking-wa-
ter is pure in the highlands it should be
boiled when used from swamps and low
ground in mosquito country a net should
be used to sleep under at night in the ab-

sence of having a net take two grains of
quinin per day quinin is both a sure pre-
ventive and cure for malaria

  wines liquors and beers should be used
in moderation if used at all the low prices
at which alcoholic drinks are sold has been
the ruin of many a man who could not have
afforded them at higher prices moderation
in all other things is a good plan

  it is an old adage that a white man should
avoid work in the tropics during con-
struction of the panama canal white men
worked harder than they were accustomed
to in the united states and had better
health thereby

  how to dress-all down through cen-
tral america a medium weight of american
clothing is worn by americans who are
there the ordinary summer weights used
here are quite right for the summer season

  for winter no overcoat is required as a
general rule unless one is in a very high alti-
tude when a light overcoat is very comfort-
able for work there is nothing better
than khaki trousers and jacket of the nor-
folk pattern and in the mountains a light-
weight suit of corduroy is ideal

  some americans who have been for a
long time in the country wear duck and
linen clothing similar to that worn by the
better-class natives for dress upon the streets
and for social gatherings full dress of the
pattern worn here and in europe are the
prevailing clothes for state occasions

  hats vary all the way from sailor straws
and panamas to high silk ones many
americans of the younger generation wear a
broad-brimmed stetson similar to those
worn by the zone police on the panama
canal zone these hats are very cool in
fact they are more of a protection than a
straw or lighter hat

  americans wear their own styles of shoes
and a great many of the better-class natives
do also but some of them wear the peculiar
style of footgear used in france the la-
dies both american and foreign try to fol-
low the latest parisian fashions

  the lower-class men wear cotton shirt
white trousers straw hats and sandals
while their women wear calico waists cotton
skirts sandals and as a rule no hat but a
sort of shawl in the early morning and cool
of the evening

tiger-hunting

a ll you need to bag one of the big cats is
nerve and the right gun and nerve and a
good eye and nerve oh yes and a tiger

  question-will you kindly give me some in-
formation on tiger-hunting where is a good place
to go and what type of gun is best is it very
expensive

  i have heard that there are black and white
varieties of the tiger if there are kindly tell me
where they are found and their size compared with
the ordinary tiger-ralph robinson indianapo-
lis ind

  answer by mr mccreagh-when you ask what
kind of gun is best for tiger-hunting i am afraid to
answer you i have heard hunters of all sorts and
ages and colors argue and fight with each other over
just this question all i dare do is is give you some
general dope and let you pick your gun accordingly

  the tiger being a soft-skinned animal doesnt
require the tremendous penetrating quality in a bul-
let that some of the big ungulates do further be-
ing of a frightfully diabolic vitality they need some-
thing that will knock them endways right when they
are hit and not ten minutes after all this would
point to the choice of a big heavy bullet with a soft
nose which will mushroom without fear of passing
right through

  one of the best tiger-hunters i ever knew the
late rajah nipendra nath bhup of koocjoehar
carried a twelve-gage shot-and-ball gun a paradox
and he shot anything from pheasant to rhinoceros
with it

  on the other hand i have seen a well-known tiger-
hunter sit up and swear by a  with a soft-nose
bullet

  personally my experience has been with a ross
 carrying a copper tube expanding bullet of 
grains i am sorry to say that while i have spent
many weary hours trying to bag a tiger it has never
been my luck to get one but i have tried out this
armament on other soft-skinned game such as
leopard and can guarantee that if you hit your
beast it curls right up

  one point i would lay particular emphasis upon
and that is the necessity for a wide-open sight for
you will never need to take a long accurate shot at a
tiger you are more likely to get your chance at very
short range and shooting at snap speed there will
never be time for fine sighting or need-in the native
jungles of the beast-for distant sighting

  as to location the absolutely best place i know is
upper burma india is pretty well worked out i
dont mean for a moment that there arent any
more tigers there are heaps of them but india
has acquired the name for a tiger-hunting country
and the competition there is with the rich sport the
guest of some high official in burma the ordinary
poor man can go out with his rifle-and his nerve
dont by any means forget his nerve-and shoot
tiger for no more cost than the price of getting
there ive known a man to step out on to his
veranda one fine morning and then suddenly rush
back into the house for his gun and right from his
front porch pick off a tiger two hundred yards away
on the hillside just my luck again that he got up
first

ive seen myself and three other men come round

the bend of a mountain road in a tonga sort of fool-
proof coach and wake up a tiger sleeping in the dust
in the sunlight of course all our guns were tucked
under our feet so the darn conveyance wouldnt
jolt them over the cliffs and the tiger just woofed
and leaped away before anybody could get a shot

  all in upper burma

  i have never heard anything about black and
white tigers though i can quite willingly believe in
a freak specimen or two turning up every now and
then

  im nearly forgetting about cost a rifle such as
the ross costs about  though mind i am not
especially recommending this were i going out
again i would consider very carefully one or two
others for instance the savage and the westley-
richards

  for about four hundred dollars you can step off
the train right in the middle of tiger country in the
chindwin or the katha section of upper burma

  if you go i wish you luck and--dont let the
natives singe the whiskers or steal the claws of all
your trophies

quechua aymara and guarani

iooks as if theres a chance here for
- some lingo-hound to make a big name
for himself in a branch of philology that
doesnt seem to have been worked much yet

  question-i am interested in the south ameri-
can languages but as yet have had no way in which
to study them

  can you tell me where i can get books necessary
to study the lesser spoken languages of south
america or have they been put in printed form

  please give me some words in the different lan-
guages in your field so that i can contrast them i
understand spanish already the uncommon lan-
guages are the ones in which im interested-
emmett w baker paducah ky

  answer by mr goldsmith-as you are doubt-
less aware there are many indian languages in
south america the three that have been most
studied and written about are i think quechua
aymara and guarani efforts have been made to
study the grammar and construction of these
languages and some books have been published
upon them in lima quito buenos aires and asun-
cin

  i know of nothing in the way of grammar that
you can secure in this country doctor julio tellio
lima perti might secure for you some of the works
that have been published in lima on quechua and
aymara you would have to write to him and see
if he would undertake to make the purchase for you
and then send him the money

  the books on guarani could be secured in asun-
cin if you are interested in them you might
write to his excellency sr manuel gondra presi-
dent of paraguay gaboto  asundn all letters
to south america should bear a five-cent stamp
sr gondra is one of the greatest living authorities
on the guarani language

  i have before me a spanish-aymara dictionary and
a spanish-quechua dictionary unfortunately these
dictionaries were made up wrongly instead of
putting the qutchua and aymara words first and
ask adventure

then defining them in spanish terms the spanish
words have been put first and they have been de-
fined in quechua and aymara terms this is of
course wholly improper and renders the work of the
student very difficult

  i place below a few words

shanghai

here are some interesting facts about
chinas most american city-and
especially about its curious currency system

  question-can you tell me something of the
climate living conditions sports and currency of
shanghai with any other information that you
may think of value-harry s potter cum-
berland md

  answer by mr halton-shanghai climate
varies from a minimum in winter of  deg f to
 deg maximum in summer with an average of
 deg this record covers a period of ten years
the average rainfall per year is  inches

  with the gold dollar at depreciated value in
chinese currency the cost of living for household
necessities is slightly higher than it would be here
but taking into account the fact that labor is
cheaper it is safe to estimate the living costs at
shanghai at the present time at about equal to
those of this countiy

  good hunting and fishing can be had within easy
reach of shanghai you will find that the various
nationalities engage in the popular sports of their
own countries americans of course play base-
ball while the britishers indulge in cricket

  the currency question is quite a complicated
affair at the present time the actual currency in
circulation at shanghai is the mexican silver dollar
the shanghai tael however is the unit ot currency
in transactions for both native and foreign mer-
chants especially in the districts bordering shang-
hai because it is generally known among foreign
business men in china

  the value of taels in the different provinces
varies considerably in some cases even individual
towns have a currency of different value a tael
is a unit of weight-not a coin prior to the war
the shanghai tael was worth  in the same
ratio the mexican dollar was worth  as
this is written the mexican dollar exchanges for
 u s gold whereas four years ago it was only
worth  cents

  shanghai itself is governed by an international
council comprising nine members of various national-
ities elected annually by the rate-payers those
members are chosen from among the most promi-
nent business men of shanghai and give their ser-
vices free

  there are four american banko having branches
in shanghai we have an american chamber of
commerce at shanghai the american residents
number  europeans  the total popu-
lation of shanghai is 

  in all respects shanghai is a modern up-to-date
city with postal telegraph street-car water light
and other facilities

finding a ships position

nothing much thats new here per-
haps for us coast-dwellers but there
may be something of interest in it for the
fellow whose idea of a hurricane deck is the
back of a bronc

  question-i have read adventure for some time
and like the sea-stories very much but in some of
them some parts are hard for me to understand
so i am going to trouble you for some information

  i would like to get information as to finding your
position at sea-taking observations etc

  i would also like to get some information about
sailing vessels that is the way of sailing them i
never could understand how a ship could sail into
the wind when it is relying on the wind for propul-
sion-perry morrison oil city pa

  answer by mr brown-a ships position at sea
is found by observation for latitude and longitude
roughly as follows through a sextant the height of
the sun above the horizon is found at noon the
point when the sun is highest to the height as


adventure

shown by the instrument certain corrections are
made through which the true altitude is found
to this another correction that for declination the
suns distance north or south of the equator is
applied subtracting this final result from 
degrees gives the latitude at the time of the observa-
tion

  from another sextant observation of the suns
altitude taken earlier or later in the day when it is
nearer the horizon the exact local time is found by
medium of a simple equation the ships chro-
nometer gives the greenwich time the difference
between the local time as found by the observation
and greenwich time at the instant of observation
gives the time interval from which to determine the
longitude there are numerous other observations
of the sun moon and certain of the stars but these
are the simplest and those most generally used by
merchant-marine navigators

  a ship does not sail into the wind she simply
sails as close to the wind as she can and keep her
sails full and drawing this is approximately six
points from the wind by the compass or 
degrees after sailing a certain distance she
tacks and sails for a time a course  degrees the
other side of the wind by a series of tacks like this
she gradually works her way in the direction whence
the wind blows this is called beating to wind-
ward the course is a series of zigzags

smokeless for cap and ball

better use black powder in weapons
designed to burn black powder-a re-
mark which may not be so obvious as it
would appear at first seeming

  question-would like to know some time a
good and safe smokeless powder to use in cap-and-
ball revolver-e b darnielle gardena idaho

  answer by mr wiggins-i would like to know
what you wish to shoot the smokeless powder in
in the cap-and-ball line

  you know that black-powder primers or caps
will not ignite the smokeless powders as it takes a
very strong fulminate to do that and as the old
revolvers are made of very soft material you would
be running a big risk in doing any experimenting
with the modern powders i would advise you
to stick to the old black powder using a greased
wad between the powder and the bullet and you
will not be badly troubled with fouling

tips on the philippines

ohooting gators with a one-pounder
 hotchkiss shouldnt be such bad sport
at that

  question-i am taking the liberty of asking you
a few things about the philippines i expect
shortly to go as skipper of an ocean-going tug to the
philippines where the tug will be used to tow barges
of lumber from some place about  miles away to
manila will have short lay-offs at each end of run

  is there any hunting if so what would you
recommend for armament i have used a -
high-power rifle slightly but down in south ameri-

can jungle country found natives used carbine
mostly on account of not being able to get any long
shots anyway

  i will be the only white man aboard the ship-
native mates engineers and crew i dont ordi-
narily pack a gun but i have been advised that the
filipinos are treacherous i have dealt with kana-
kas and samoans and found them always trust-
worthy would you think it advisable to carry a
pistol

  the reason given by my prospective employers
for wanting a man is that the philippine government
has passed a law that all captains ot steamers run-
ning coastwise there must hold masters licenses
now that sounds like bull to me for if the islands are
part of the u s the usual rules of the steamboat
inspectors should have been in force right along and
even if it had been lax it would be up to the super-
vising steamboat inspector in washington to decide
when to tighten up on requirements and not any
local government can you give me any light on
this

  i have a few thousand dollars saved up can you
suggest any side line that would be profitable
trading with the natives i dont mean gun-
running or dope--- brooklyn n y

  answer by mr connor- relative to hunting
there is some hunting-deer of the puny specimens
some tropical birds and that about spells the list

  	your - rifle would be ample for all the
hunting you would get there-wild boars can be
killed with a six-shooter-they are the most common
game in samar island i have shot the golden-
backed alligators with the hotchkiss one-pounder
deck-meunt navy gun-sometimes we saw the
effects but mostly they just slipped down the bank
into the river and were carried away in the muddy
waters of the catubig river but i think your
- will be sufficient you will however have to
get permit to carry or have same in your possession
in the philippines

  	the filipinos are not so treacherous they
were at the time of our occupation but that was due
to the preceding reign of spanish terror throughout
the islands we have educated them and now
they are a thriving race that flaunts the miracle of
new colonization in the face of england who has
been centuries at the business of subjugating bar-
barous races to civilization

  	it is well to remember relative to your ques-
tion concerning the master and marine law that
most everything in the islands is fashioned after our
own laws which brings the latter part of your
question to par-they should have been in force
years ago excepting possibly when sillh as lorchas
a type of two-masted schooner of about  tons is
concerned suppose you inquire of the chief
inspector washington d c-he has the dope
on it

  	as to investments i am not sure if pina cloth-
a coconut fabric-would be profitable or not it is
light and does not require much space as a side line
like hemp or other philippine products would

  i would advise that you wait until you arrive at
manila before you plan on anything save getting
acclimated and acquainted with the country i do
think however that you will like the country espe-
cially when you compare it with south america i
would give my thoughts mostly to the southern
portion of the group-jolo of the sulu groups

anticosti and labrador

chill and bleak though it may be in the
cold months labrador is sure the good
word for summer seems funny though
the first time youre up there to be reading
the paper outdoors at nine oclock p m or
after and then maybe wake up at half-
past three in the morning to find its
broad day

  question-please send to me the most complete
information you can on the natural resources and
the opportunities for camping and fishing and modes
of travel on anticosti island and the north shore of
the st lawrence east of the saguenay river-
c b tavenner paeonian springs va

   answer by mr belford-anticosti is a privately
owned island the proprietor of which is meunier of
chocholate fame resident in paris modes of com-
munication on the island and along the eastern part

of the north shore are confined to water routes in
summer and dog-teams in the winter many
summer resorts are found on the north shore
reached by steamer from montreal or quebec

  the fishing is of the best and i should say the
best way to make the trip would be to secure a
guide with boat and supplies at tadousac-
reached by steamer-and then cruise the north
shore it would be difficult to cover the distance in
one season

  east of anticosti the canadian labrador will well
repay a visit salmon and trout swarm in the riv-
ers sea fish of most kinds are plentiful the scenery
is wild and bleak but magnificent the summer
climate cool the people in themselves are worth a
visit mode of travel either boat or dog-team ac-
cording to season if one has the time there is no
finer summer cruise

  the north shore will repay the traveler much
better than anticosti the labrador most of all

  as to natural resources pulp-wood fish furs
clarke city is a paper town reached only by water
on a cruise one can depend on fisk and game can be
had

  hunting and fishing permits are necessary and
are to be obtained from the inspector of fisheries
and game quebec city a copy of hunting and
fishing containing full information will be sent you
on application to mr e d t chambers govern-
