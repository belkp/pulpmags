    i-the blood of the dragon

 through the legend-dimmed
 mist of centuries we look back
 to the stony plain of mars where
 jason harnessed the fiery-breathed bulls

	of vulcan to the plow of eetes and in
 the furrows that he left behind him
 sowed the dragons teeth and straight-
 way there sprang up from the torn soil
 armed men ready for battle blinded by
 the dust that the hero threw into their
 faces they turned swiftly upon one an-
 other with unreasoning fury and slew
 and slew

    to-day across the seas the once smil-
  itig land of france has been turned
  again into the stony field of mars
  plowed by the howitzers of the huns
  harrowed by their machine guns in the
  ground thus prepared by the fiery-
  breathed bulls of a modern vulcan un-
  knowingly the teeth of the dragon were
  again sown and those of the dragons
  blood sprang up into armed men and
  slew and slew blinded not by the dust
  that humble labor cast into their eyes

   kan wong the sampan boatman sat
 in the bow of his tiny craft looking with
 dream-misted eyes upon the oily yellow
 flood of the yangtze river far across

  -l 

on the opposite shore blurred by the
mist that the alchemy of the setting sun
transmuted from miasmic vapor to a
veil of gold rose the purple-shadowed
stone-tumbled ruins of hang gow ruins
that had been a proud walled city in
the days before the taiping rebellion
swept with its fiery blight over the low-
lands of the rich yangtze valley with-
ering the rice fields drying the standing
tea in the bud of the leaf sweeping away
villages and even whole cities as the
leaves of the willow tree in die path of
the simoom are stripped and whirled off
upon its fierce breath in those fiery
days of the dragons wrath the gods
turned their faces from men and re-
turned to the fastnesses of the distant
hills leaving at the mercy of the hairy
rebels upward of a hundred million
souls of these a good tenth left their
flesh and bones to the later fertilizing
of the yangtze valley during the fifteen
years that it forgot the ways of peace
and the claws of the dragon harrowed
it in anger for those who had turned
from him and the worship of their an-
cestors even now seventy years after
the ever victorious army forced peace
again upon the land hang gow is but

one of the many gigantic monuments of
destruction that the dragons wrath left
behind

  viewing its slowly dimming towers as
they sank into the fading gold of the
mist that the coming night thickened and
darkened as it wiped out the light with
a damp hand kan wong dreamed over
the stories that his fathers father-now
revered dust somewhere off toward the
his that dimly met the melting skyline-
had told him of that ruined city wherein
he kan wong had not fate made men
mad would now be ruling a lordly
household even wearing the peacock
leather and embroidered jacket that were
his by right of the dragons blood that
blood now hidden under the sun-browned
sjcin of a river coolie kan wong
stuffed fine-cut into his brass-bowled pipe
and struck a spark from his tinder box
through his wide nostrils twin streamers
of smoke writhed out twisting fantas-
tically together and mixing slowly with
the rising river mist his pipe became
a wand of dreams summoning the genii
of glorious memory the blood  the
dragon in his veins quickened from the
lethargy to which drudgery had cooled it
and raced hotly as he thought of the
battle past of his forefathers

  the war of the rebellion of new
china had been fought far away to the
north and east only its backwash of
reform had welled up the yangtze slow-
ly and almost imperceptibly its tide
crept so insidiously into old china the
china to which kan wong belonged and
so little changed his condition that he
would never have known of it save for
the edict that had removed his cue thus
taking him from under tlie manchu yoke
without affecting the grooves of labor
upon his shoulders on which the new
yoke settled with the same weight of
burden new china meant nothing to
him the nohiiity of his forebears had
been inherited from the manchu and
it was lost when they cast their lot with
the taipings kan wong still looked

 back into the shadow of the dragon a
 shadow now removed but in which
 gleamed the glory of a past that should
 have given color to his future war
 that great leveler of the highborn to the
 soil and the raiser of the lowborn into
 exalted places had cast his fortune
 into the descending scale of fate
 when it had spilt his father onto
 the yangtze plain stripped of honor and
 weapons a wreck of revolution whose
 offspring like the chip of a blasted oak
 had fallen upon the oily bosom of the
 river the only heritage that the past
 had bequeathed to kan wong was the
 tales of glory before the taipings rose
 the fifteen years strife loot mounting
 to wealth then the scales tipped as
 the plow of war turned under the spoil
 of the vanquished and he rose from the 
 strife-torn soil a weed growth where a
 family tree had fallen in its flower

   he grunted and tapped his now dead
 pipe on the gunwale the ashes like
 those of his dreams fell upon the dark-
 ening waters of the slow flowing river
 he turned back under the arched mat-
 ting to blow the charcoal brazier for the
 evening rice for there was no woman
 with sprawling brood to make an effigy
 of home for him he was of the drag-
 ons blood and would rule a lordly house

	a was his right or none at all and so
 he remained a celibate looking with con-
 tempt upon the coolies who spawned
 upon the river like so many weak-fleshed
 fish what need had he of sons to wor-
 ship and perpetuate his memory if it
 were not worthy better let the line
 die out with him who burned punk and
 prayer papers to ancestors whose past
 was glorious than raise a coolie breed oi
 water beetles to skim the oily bosom of
 the yangtze picking up a miserable ex-
 istence from the cum of its refuse

   the mist turned a faint yellow with
 the rising of the round copper disk  
 the full moon kan wong sat again in
 the bow and dreamed in the golden light

length where it crawled slowly to the
sea lay the great coast cities the lazy
ripples light-tipped beckoned with lur-
ing fingers there was naught to stay
him his sampan was his home and mov-
able therefore the morrow would see him
turning its bow downstream to seek that
strange city where he had heard dwelt
many foreign devils who now and
then scattered wealth with a prodigal
hand if it had been in the old days
when he a son of the dragon might
borrow its claws there was the loot of
piracy to lure but now the blood of
the dragon was cold and sluggish even
in the veins where it still flowed his
brethren fawned for favor even as he
must but not to his own kind he
would go down the river even to shang-
hai and work since no other means
offered until he had enough to buy a
junk then with a few adventurous
spirits aboard there was still the fighting
gains of piracy along some of the river
stretches years before it had been his
fortune to serve a foreign devil and he
had since often met boys on whom he
could practice the pidgin english he
had acquired for just such an adventure
and so under the magic light of the
moon he curled up in a sleep that the
soft radiance warmed to a brood of
dreams that would be his freight down
the river till the gray hand of the dawn
tapped his eyelids and bade him open
them

  in that pale hour when the mist not
yet dissipated by the rising sun lay in
a cold silver veil upon the night-chilled
waters he pushed out from the shore
and pointed the sampans prow down-
stream days it took him to reach salt
water he loitered for light cargoes at
village edges or picked up the price of
his daily rice at odd tasks ashore but
always were it day or night for travel
his tiny craft bore surely seaward mile
after slow mile dropped behind him like
the praying beads of a lama s chain but
at last the river salted slightly and his

tiny craft was lifted by the slow swell
of the seas hand reaching far inland

  the river became more populous the
crowding sampans houseboats and junks
stretched far out into its oily oozy flow
making a floating city as he neared the
congested life of the coast where the
ever-increasing population failed to find
ground space in its maggoty swarming
as the stream widened until the farther
bank disappeared in the artificial mist
of rising smoke and man-stirred dust the
foreign devils fire junks appeared ma-
jestically steaming up and down-swift
swans that scorned the log lumbering
native craft the mat sails and toiling
sweeps of which made them appear mo-
tionless by comparison a day or two
of this and then die coast with shang-
hai sprawling upon the bank writhing
with life odoriferous noisy perpetually
awake

  kan wong slid into its waterfront tur-
moil an infinitesimal human atom added
to it his tiny craft fixed itself upon
the outer edge of the wriggling river life
like a coral cell attaching itself to a
slow growing atoll from there he
worked his way inshore crawling over
the craft that stretched out from the low
banks as a water beetle might move over
the flotsam and jetsam caught in the
backwater of a sluggish stream once
in the narrow crowded streets of the
city itself he roamed aimlessly open-
eyed to its wonders dreamily observant
out of the native quarter and into the
foreign section he moved accustoming
himself to these masters of mystery
whom he was about to serve calling slug-
gish memory to his aid as his ears strove
to reconstruct the meaning of the bar-
barous jargon

  into the quarter where the foreign
devils and the native population came
together to barter and to trade he
strayed one day a foreign devil in a
strangely unattractive uniform was ad-
dressing a crowd of coolies in their own
tongue kan wong attached himself to


studies in saffron

the outer edge of the impassively cari-
ous throng- his ears alert his features
as ever an imperturbable mask the
foreign officer for such he seemed to be
was making an otler to the assemblage
for contract labor one dollar a day with
rice fish and tea rations for work in a
foreign land kan wong translated the
money quickly into yens the sum
seemed incredible to him what service
would he not perform for such payment
why within a year or two at the very
most with careful frugality he might
return and buy himself a junk worthy of
his dragon dreams of the river and
ttien   

  the officer talked on persuading hold-
ing out the glittering lure of profit and
adventure kan wong listened eagerly
he had thought there was a ban on con-
tract labor but perhaps this new repub-
lican government so friendly to the
foreign devil had removed it surely
one who wore the uniform of a soldier
and an officer could not thus publicly
solicit coolies without the sanction of the
mandarins or escape their notice

  kan wong studied the crowd it con-
tained a few chinese soldiers who were
obviously keeping order he was satis-
fied and edged his way closer to the
speaker there already ranged to one
side was a line of his own kind jab-
bering to a celestial who put down their
names on slips of rice paper and ac-
cepted their marks which they made with
a bamboo brush that they bonded them-
selves to the adventure kan wong
gained the signing table picking lip the
brush he set his name the name of one
of the dragons blood to the contract
accepted a duplicate and stepped back
into the waiting line to what he had
committed himself he did not know lie
did not care so long as liis pay was forth-
coming that it would be he had no
doubt for tbe foreign devils especially
those who spoke the english tongue were
famed for their honesty they were not
like the portuguese whose tongue was

the father of lies strange they were
it is true but good masters to serve
having bound himself to them his way
lay with them across the sea that
stretdied out to the east away from the
river on whidi his life had been spent
so fruitlessly and to which he would not
return until lie could mount its tide with
the honor to whidi he felt tliat his blood
entitled him

  his pay and his rations he was told
would begin two days hence wiien he
was to report to the fire junk now lying
at the dock awaiting the human cargo of
which he was a part kan wong mem-
orized the directions as he turned away
from his instructing countryman of
the foreign devil he took no further
notice time enough for that when he
passed into service the god of luck
had smiled upon his boldness and re-
flecting upon it kan wong turned back
to the river and the sampan that had so
long been his floating home no senti-
mental memories however clung about
it for him its freight of dreams he had
lauded here in shanghai marketing them
for a realization the sampan now was
but the empty shell of a water beetle
that had crawled upon the bank into the
sun of fortune to spill forth a dragon
fly to try newly found wings of adven-
ture

  he found a customer and with much
haggling after the manner of his kind
disposed of his boat the last tie if tie
there were that bound him to his present
life waterman he had always been
and now had come to him the call of the
father of all waters the tang of the
salt in his nostrils conjured up dreams as
magical as those invoked by the wand
of the poppy god wrapped in their
rosy mantle he walked the streets for
the next two days and on the third he
took his way to the dock where lay the
fire junk that was to bear him forth into
the wonders of the foreign devils land
larger she loomed than any he had ever
seen larger oh much larger than those

which had steamed up the yangtze in
swanlike majesty but this huge bulk
was gray-gray and squat and power-
ful once aboard he found it crowded
with an army of chattering coolies
they swarmed in the hold like maggots
vefy inch of space was given over to
them an army it seemed to kan wong
in which he was all but lost an army
it proved to be as the anchor lifted and
the boat swung slowly down the river
and out into the deep swell of the lordly
pacific

  once clear of land the native boss
boysbetgan instructions in almost military
discipline everything was done by rote
and rule the rice and fish and tea were
served at stated time squads being told
off to act as kitchen police in squads
they took their exercise on deck now up
now down a given space at a walk or a
trot to keep them in condition and al-
ways under the eye of the uniformed
foreign devils yet they were kindly
treated and well fed attention was paid
to their welfare and they were allowed as
much liberty as the crowded vessel per-
mitted kan wong wondered at the
order and orderliness of it all of a
truth these foreign devils possessed
much magic and their junk smooth-rid-
ing even in storm was a thing that ex-
cited his wonder

  the display of his admiration his
ready seamanship when occasion offered
his quiet dignity and an indefinable
something that set him above the coolie
crowd with which he was surrounded
brought him to the notice of the for-
eign devil who had them in charge
discovering that kan wong had a smat-
tering of pidgin english he put him
in charge of a squad noting with keen
satisfaction the quiet and efficient au-
thority he immediately exerted over
them

   day after day across the waste of wa-
ter tfhe ship took its eastern way never
had kan wong dreamed there was so
much water in the world the broad

long river that had been his lifes path
seemed but a narrow trickle on the
earths face compared with this stretch
of sea that never ended though the days
ran into weeks the land coolies chafed
and found much sickness in the swell
but kan wong used ever to a moving
deck found the way none too long and
smiled softly to himself as lie counted
up the dollars they were paying him for
the keenest pleasure that had ever been
his

  at last land appeared the ship
swung into the dock disclosing to the
questioning eyes of kan wong and his
kind a new strange land in orderly
discipline they were marched off the ves-
sel and on to the dock but rest was
not theirs as yet nor was this their final
destination from the fire junk they
boarded the flying iron horse of the for-
eign devils  again they were on the move
swiftly across the land they went over
high mountains crowded with eternal
snow thence down upon brown rolling
plains as wide as the flat stretches of
the broad yangtze valley eastward ever
eastward through a land sparsely people-
for all its virgin fertility behind their
flying progress the days dropped-one
two three four at last five and then
they entered a more populous region
kan wong his nose flattened against the
glass that held the moving picture as in
a frame wondered much at the magic
that unrolled to his never-sated eyes
yet the journeys end was beyond his
questioning

  once more they came to a seaport
marching from the carriages once more
they beheld the sea but this time it
was different-more turbulent harsher
more sombre with the hint of waiting
storms was there then more than one
ocean kan wong asked himself he
found that it was indeed so when once
more a fire junk received them this
one was grayer than the first that they
had known upon her decks were guns
and at her side were other junks tew

menacing with a demon flurry of vicious
speed and short squat funnels that
belchcd dense smoke clouds within the
town were many foreign devils all
dressed alike in strange drab uniforms
on the docks anjl here and there at other
places they bore arms and other unmis-
takable equipment of fighting men which
even kan wong could not but notice

  verily these foreign devils were a
strange breed what use had they for
him and his coolie brethren where
were they taking them across this un-
known unsuspected sea how wide
was the world and what was the end
of it and then well it mattered not
a fatalist by birth and centuries of breed-
ing kan wong faced the sea again com-
mitted to the adventure of his bond as
were they all if they lived up to it
the foreign devils must live up to their
part of it as he was sure they would
his pay was mounting the food was
good and plentiful and he was in the
hands of fate it would be a tale to tell
his children some day when he returned
to the broad yangtze-children to whom
he could hand down the dragons blood
and a memory that they would revere
and worship now that he had the mak-
ing of a worthy one in sight at any
rate he had not stayed to rot as a coolie
in the land where he should have been-
what he meant to be before he would
return to it

  the gray ship moved out into a cold
gray fog with it were other ships as
gray and as crowded ships that crawled
with men strange foreign devils who
clanked with weapons as they walked
aboard again a waste of water through
which the ship seemed to crawl with a
caution that kan wong felt but did not
understand with it on either side
moved those other junks-squat men-
acing standing low on the horizon but
as haunting as dark ghosts where were
they bound ths strangely mixed fleet
often kan wong pondered this but gave
it no tongue to hic fellow-passengers

holding a bit aloof from them by virtue
of his caste and the newly vested au-
thority given him by the foreign devil
a trust that he kept to the strictest let-
ter though he saw not the purpose of
keeping the men under him to a rigid
and seemingly senseless routine he was
his masters servant for the time he
obeyed unreasoningly and commanded
obedience from the coolies under him

  again they neared the shore where
other boats low-built and bristling with
guns flew swiftly out to meet them like
fierce ocean birds of prey now they
skirted high bleak cliffs their feet hid in
a lather of white foam then they round-
ed the cliffs and passed into a storm-
struck stretch of sea through which they
rolled to a more level land off which
they cast anchor the long ocean jour-
ney was finished at last

  there was a frantic bustle at this port
increasing a hundredfold when once they
set foot upon the land men-men were
everywhere men in various uniforms
men who spoke various tongues in a con-
fusing babel yet they all seemed intent
upon one purpose the import of which
kan wong could but vaguely guess ah
about them was endless movement but
no confusion and once ashore their work
commenced immediately

  from the fleet of fire junks various
cargoes were to be unloaded with all
speed and at this the coolies toiled
numberless crates boxes and bags came
ashore to be stowed away in long low
buildings r loaded into long lines of
rough boxlike carriages that then went
scurrying off behind countless snorting
and puffing fire-horses to the east always
to the east and north strange engines
which the foreign devils saw to it that
they handled most tenderly were also
much in evidence and always at all
hours the uniformed men with their
bristling arms and clanking equipment
crowded into the carriages and were
whisked off to the east always to the
east and north they went with much
thomas grant springer



grange -homing and to kan wongs
frs discordant sounds that they mistook
for music yet now and then other
strings of carriages came back from the
t at and north with other men-men
broken woody lacking limbs groping in
blindness their faces twisted with pain
as they were loaded into the waiting fire
iunks to recross the rough sea

  then came the turn of the coolies to
be crowded into the boxlike carriages and
to be whisked off to the east with them
went tool-picks shovels and the like-
for further work upon the nature of
which kan wong unquestioning specu-
lated it was a stow broken journey
that they made every now and then
they stopped that other trafc might pass
them going either way mostly the
strange men in uniforms bristling with
guns hurrring to the east always to the
east and north

  at last they too turned north and as
they did so the country which had been
smiling low filled with soft fields and
pretty nestling houses little towns and
quiet orderly cities changed to bleak
elds cm and seared as by a simooms
angry breath still there were little
towns-or what had been little towns
now tumbled ruins-fire-smitten grit-
ted their windows gaping like blind eyes
in the -face of a twisted cripple off to
the east hung angry clouds from which
the thunder echoed distantly a thunder
low grumbling continual menacing and
through the clouds at night were light-
ning flashes of an angry red toward
this storm it seemed that all the men
were hurrying and so too were the
coolies of whom kan wong was one
often the chattered speculative of the
storm beyond what did it mean  why
did the men hurry toward instead of
away from it truly the ways of the
foreign devils were strange 

  a they dre nearer to the storm the
river dream of kan worg returned
this wa indeed the land of the dragons
wrath the tom and harrowed fiews

the empty broken towns the distant
grumbling storm and the armed men
hurrying always hurrying toward the
east and north where the clouds dark-
ened and spread-all this was in the tales
that his fathers father had told him of
those fifteen mad years when the yangtze
valley crouched trembling under the
fiery breath of the dragons wrath here
once more he saw the crumbling towers
and walls of hang govv in fresh ruin
here was the ruthless wreck that even
nature in her fiercest mood could never
make truly the lure of the dragons
blood in him was drawing rim magnet-
like to the glory of his ancestors

  at length they were set down just be-
hind the fury of the storm ahead
everywhere were the armed men going
coming in feverish haste those who
went were full of confidence and had a
son of fierce joy shining in their faces
those who cme hid faces distorted by
lines of pain their bodies were broken
bleeding maimed the air was full of
noisy sparks -  arid mels  
dust and ashes there were mam sweat-
ing horses dragging past the strange in-
struments of which the foreign devils
seemed so tenderly careful nd also
many other fast-moving carriages pro-
pelled by a strange magic at a high speed
these tore hither and thither and were
filled with men others slower moving
but still propelled by the same strange
magic rumbled past shaking the earth
with the burden of their loads above
high in the air flew swift strange birds
their wings humming noisily and as
kan wong learned bearing men to and
fro in and out of the storm clouds on
the low horizon

  brtt there was little time for ibcm
to observe all these wonders of the
foreign devils magic the one who had
them in charge and spoke their tongue
gave them their tools and bade them dig
narrow ditches head deep from them
they ran tunnels into deep caves hollowed
out far tnder the ground they bur-

rowed like moles cutting galleries here
and there reinforcing them with timbers
and lining them with a stone which they
made of dust and water many they cut
stretching far back behind the ever-
present storm in front of them while
from that stormcloud in swift and un-
seen lightning bolts that roared and burst
and destroyed their work often as fast
as it was completed fell death among
them who were only laborers not sol-
diers as kan wong now knew those
foreign devils in the strange and dirty
uniforms to be

  as the storm roared on never ceas-
ing it stirred the dragons blood in kan
wongs veins the pick and shovel irked
his hands as he swung them his palms
began to itch for the weapons that the
soldiers bore now and then he came
upon a gun where it had dropped from
its owners useless hands he studied its
mechanism even asking the foreign
devil overseer how it was worked and
being shown he remembered and prac-
ticed its use whenever opportunity of-
fered he took to talking with his fel-
low-workers some of whom had them-
selves fought with the rebels of new
china who with just such foreign dev-
ils tools had clipped the claws of the
manchu dragon freeing the celestial
kingdom forever from its crooked grip
he took much interest in these war im-
plements he became more intimate and
friendly with his fellows feeling them
now to be brothers in a danger that had
awakened the soldier soul beneath the
brown of his coolie skin

  little could he make of all the strife
about him all of which he was sure
was that this was the dragons field and
he a son of the dragon had been guided
to it to fufil a destiny his forefathers
had begun in the yangtze valley when
with the hairy rebels they had waged
such war as this the flying death all
about him that now and then claimed
toll of one of his own kind was but a
part of it but all the time he grew to

hate his humble work and long for a
part a real part in the fighting that
raged ahead where an unseen enemy of
whom he grew to think as his own
hurled destruction among them often
he spoke of this to the gang under him
imbuing them with the spirit of the
dragons blood that eager to fuiil its
destiny once more boiled within him

  then one day the storm grew more
furious the thunder was a continual
roll and both from the front and rear
flew the whining lightning bolts spew-
ing out death and destruction many a 
coolie fell his dust buried under the dust
of this fierce foreign land never to be
returned and mixed with that of his own
flowery kingdom now and then came
stink pots filling the air with such
foul vapors that men coughed out their
lives in the putrid fumes the breath of
the dragon fresh from his awful mouth
was wrapped about them in hot wrath

  past them the soldiers streamed foul
with fight their hot guns spitting vicious-
ly back into the rolling pungent gray fog
that followed them malignantly con-
fusion reigned and in that confusion a
perfect riot of death on all sides the
soldiers fell blighted by the dragons
breath the coolies crouched in the
heaped up ruins of their newly dug
ditches knowing not which way to turn
bereft of leadership since the foreign
devil who commanded them was gone
buried beneath a pile of earth where a
giant cracker had fallen

  suddenly kan w ong noticed that there
were no more soldiers save only those
rwho lay writhing or in still twisted
heaps upon the harrowed ground the
coolie crowd huddled here alone clutch-
ing their futile picks and shovels grov-
eling in helpless panic disaster had
overtaken them the dragon was upon
them and they were unprotected all
about them in scattered heaps lay dis-
carded equipment guns even the sharp-
barking death-spitting tiny instrument
that the soldiers handled so lovingly and
thomas grant springer



so gently when it was not in action but
those who manned the weapons had
passed on back through the thick curtain
of smoke that hung between them and
the comparative safety of the rear

  kan wongs eyes were ahead striv-
ing to pierce the pungent veil that hid the
enemy suddenly his keen eyes noted
them-the strange uniforms and stranger
faces ducking forward here and there
through the hell of their own making
the blood of the dragon within him
boiled up now that the enemy was really
near enough to feel the teeth and claws
of the dragons whelps this was the
hour for which he had lived this was
the taiping glory come again for him to
share reaching down he picked up the
rifle of a fallen soldier fondled its mech-
anism lovingly for a moment and then
cuddling it tenderly beneath his chin his
finger bade it spit death at the misty
gray figures crawling through the grayer
fog in front   

  when the magazine was exhausted he
filled it with fresh clips and turned with
the authority he had always wielded and
a new one that they instantly recognized
upon his shivering countrymen

  what are ye he yelled with with-
ering scorn sons of pigs who root in
the dung of this foreign devils land or
men of the dragons blood are ye
the scum of the yangtze river or honor-
able descendants of the hairy rebels
would ye avenge your brothers who have
choked to death in the breath of the
stink-pots that have been flung among
us will ye let escape this horde of
foreign devil enemies who have hurled
at us giant crackers that have spit death
now that they are near enough to feel
how the dragons blood  can strike 
here are the dragons claws he
waved his bayoneted gun aloft will
ye die like men or like slinking rats
stamped into the earth all who are not
cowards-come he waved the way
through the smoke to the gray figures
emerging from it

  the chinaman is no coward when once
aroused death he faces as he faces life
stoically imperturbably the coolies
reaching for the nearest weapons fol-
lowed the-man who showed the dragons
blood many of them understood the
use of arms having borne them for new
china death was upon them and they
went to meet it with death in their hands

  kan wong dragged up an uninjured
machine gun the crew of which lay dead
about it fitting the bands of cartridges
as he had seen the gunners do he turned
the crank and swung it round on its
revolving tripod before its vicious rain
he saw the gray figures fall and a great
joy welled up in his breast he sig-
naled for other belts and worked the gun
faster round him the coolies rallied
others beyond the sound of his  voice
joined in from pure instinct the gray
figures wavered hesitated melted back
into the smoke and then strove to work
around the fire of the death-spitting
group but the dragons blood was up
the voice of the dragons son cheered
and directed the snarling roused whelps
to whom war was an old old trade for-
gotten and now remembered in this
strange wild land the joy of slaughter
came savagely upon them the death
that they had received they now gave
back in the place the white men had
fled the yellow men now stood descend-
ants of the taipings as fierce and wild
as their once hairy brothers

  meanwhile behind them the retreating
line halted stiffened by hurried rein-
forcements the officers rallied their
men paused and looked back through the
smoke the line had given way and they
must meet the oncoming wave quick-
ly reforming they picked their ground
for a stand and waited the moments
passed but no sign of the victors

  what the hell is up snarled one of
the reinforcing officers i thought the
line had given way

  it has replied the panting battle-
torn comirtander my men are all back
may wind

here theres no one in front but the
enemy t

  whats that ahead then  the
sharp bark of rifles the rat-a-tat of ma-
chine guns the boom of bursting gren-
ades and the yells gvoans screams and
shouts of hand-to-hand conflict came
through the curtaining smoke in a mad
jumble of savage sound

  damned if i know wed better
find out they began moving their
now rallied men back into it

   suddenly they came upon it-a writh-
ing mass of jeans-clad coolies wild-eyed
their teeth bared in devilish savage
grins their hands busy with the imple-
ments of death standing doggedly at
bay before gray waves that broke upon
them as a sullen sea breaks and recedes
be forea jutting point of land

  with the reinforcements the tide
turned ebbing back in a struggling
writhing fury and soon the ground was
clear again of all save the wreck that
such a wave leaves behind it once the
line was reestablished and the soldiers
holding it steadily the coolies once more
the wielders of pick and shovel returned
to the work of trench repairing leaving
the fighting to those to whom it be-
longed

   the officers were puzzled what had
started them what had injected that
mad fighting spirit into their yellow
hides  what had caused them to make
that swift wild wonderful stand

  hey you john the commanding
officer addressed one of them when a lull
came and they were busy again at the

tumbled earth what you right for
hey 

  the coolie grained foolishly

  him say fight him heap big man
alle same have dlagons blood him say
light we fight sabcf and hr pointed
to kan w ong-kan wong his head
bleeding from a wound his eyes glow-
ing with a green fury from between
i heir narrow lids his long strong hands
red with blood other than his own still
clutching his rifle with a grip that had
a tenderly savage joy in it

  the officer approached him

  are you the man who rallied the
coolies and held the line he asked
shortly

  kan wong stiffened with a dignity to
which he now felt he had a right

  me fight he said quietly-me fight
coolie right too me belong dlagons
blood one time my people righting
men long time i wait

  youll wait no longer said the of-
ficer he unpinned the cross from his
tunic and fastened it to the torn bloody
blouse of kan wong off to the east
are men of your own race fightmg-men
from china cochin-china that is the
place for a man of the dragons blood
-and that is the tool that belongs in your
hand till were done with this -mess
he pointed to the rifle that kan wong
still held with a stiff loving lingering
grip

  and so on the other side of the world
the son of the dragon came to his own
and realized the dreams of a glory he
had missed	v 

you may say what you please about bolshevism but it certainly lias been a
     tremendous aid to conversation

  by ethel watts mumford

h tjt my dear good woman

j the little old maid primly
seated on the re-covered sofa
looked the reverend mr paul in the
face with eyes at once weary and stub-
born

im tired of being a good woman
she replied in a hushed sick-room voice

  dont dont he ejaculated you
of all women thank god you couldnt
be anything else but a good woman 
mr paul fairly bristled truculent ap-
proval of her maiden past

  yes she agreed sadly i am afraid
i am too old now

  the elderly adviser paled

  i can only account for your extraor-
dinary conduct he quavered on the
ground of demoniac possession i re-
fuse to believe that one so exemplary can
seriously speak as you are speaking or
contemplate such actions

  miss peck refolded her long hands
precisely almost as if invisible fingers
creased and turned them like putting old
lace carefully away

  im sorry she said meekly that i
told john anything about it i ought to
have gone over to the city and zvrit back
but somehow i felt as if john bein my
brother an the head of the family i shud
speak to him i might have known hed
go to you

  of course he came to me mr
pauls withered-apple visage wrinkled in
indignation have i not always been
the devoted friend of every member of
your family-your father your dear
mother those sainted women your
aunts he would have neglected his
duty if he had not come to me

  miss peck set her narrow lips

  thank you but there isnt the slight-
est use arguin youre not looking at
the rights of the case-leastways not at
my rights i took care of mother and
aunt sue and sister emma till the lord
took em an  dont believe the lord in-
tends me to take up johns cross for him
an nurse his wife and children sos he
can let martha go and only keep one
servant

  all my life ive been in somebody
elses groove-i aint never found my
own now i just want to do somethin
its a human pleasure to do ive wanted
what was live an pretty an all i ever
had was a cat i wanted young people
when i was young an i never cud have
em because there wuz always them as it
wuz my plain duty to do for an the
money i inherited from grandpa steele
i had to spend on keepin the household
goin because they said bein an unmar-
ried woman i hadnt but myself to spend
it on

  oh i know johns been countin on
gettin me to housekeep for eliza an my
incomell come in handy an mebbe with
me puttin in my money on the livin ex-
penses he cud spare enough of his for an
automobile well hes lookin to betted
himself an im lookin to better myself
an them two aint one

  your brother very properly and very
generously offers you the shelter of his
home mr paul looked with an ap-
praising eye at the spacious parlor and
its old-fashioned but once costly furni-
ture and you could rent this place to
summer folks for three or maybe four
hundred dollars




her groove

  she nodded acquiescence at that

  mr smith says six on account of
the shade trees an garden ive told him
to go ahead and rent for as i said to
john im thinkin of bein gone some
time i know theres a groove for me
somewhere an im goin to find it

  and your brother has a right to know
where you are going the family
friend was suddenly dragged back to the
consideration of the enormity of miss
pecks avowed intentions you an un-
married woman

  the ghost of a smile trembled on the
virgin lips

  im goin to jine a friend-a woman
friend-an mr smith is my lawyer an
if john wants to lind out about my health
or-or happiness or anythin brotherly
like that why elisha will be in touch
with me count of my rents an such
the bitterness and irony deepened in her
voice im leavin to night on the eight-
thirty an thank you for yer visit
good-by

  she rose and perforce he rose also

  it shall not be said that i allowed you
to stray unwarned he rumbled

  she glanced at him-was it coquet-
tishly mr paul could hardly believe
his eyes

  why if youre thinkin of cornin over
to providence with me itivud look better
to take the mornin train

  what exclaimed the outraged shep-
herd

  well i dont know whats to hinder
she appeared to consider the situation
judicially pm some over twenty-one
and i can pay my own way an if john
wants a guardeen appointed for me all i
says is let him try you forget an
john forgets that ive been put upon an
kept down in somebody elses groove an
shoved about all my life an now im
just bulgin so if you care to set in the
parlor why youre welcome to set but
youll have to excuse uta for im goin to
my own room to finish my packin a
faint flush had mantled her pale cheeks

her faded eyes snapped unwonted lire

  mr paul looked helplessly at the hall-
way and the shining newel post it was
obviously impossible for him to pursue
this recalcitrant maiden to her ledroom
yet to permit such a dismissal was to ac-
cept humiliation

  i hope-i pray he groaned that
you will not live to look back upon this
hour as the dark turning-point of your
life i have warned you

  tell martha-miss pecks voice
readied him from the upper landing-
that she neednt worry about thomas
ive bought a cat basket an im taking
him with me

  the liall door slammed

  miss elizabeth kiughed out loud the
sound shocked her instinctively she
shot a glance at the doors down the hall
-the doors that for so many weary years
had opened and closed to the tyrannical
orders of the two warped and vampirish
women who had drained her yonth and
sapped her life the silence was reassur-
ance she was free with no regrets and
no self-reproaches-free-to indulge
herself to be herself a neat new suit-
case lay on the bed over the walnut
footboard spread her best blue foulard
and her black straw hat with the butter-
cup clusters that had been universally
criticized as unsuitable-even before
custom had demanded respectful black
she hated black it might be a sin but
crape she abominated she was deter-
mined not to put on mourning the
town could call shame to her she would
be too far to hear sire meant to wear
gay colors and frequent cheerful places
the word appropriate should no longer
exist in her bright lexicon before the
mirror she fluffed her faded hair loosen-
ing it from its prim coil

  she would wear siik underwear she
decided she had seen it advertised and
she loved the caressing touch of silk
she meant in her orgy of extravagance
to put herself quite beyond the pale of
propriety wholesale sinful waste it
ethel watts mumford



was to be it included a bottle of mary
garden perfume all her practical
everyday belongings were neatly stored
in the attic the new suitcase would
contain only what necessaries could not
be dispensed with for her entire ward-
robe was to be new

  having completed her toilet closed the
bag made a tour of inspection of each
speckless chamber she picked up the
purring cat from its accustomed cushion
soothed its reluctant introduction into
the shining traveling basket secured all
windows and doors locked the kitchen
door on the outside and without a sigh
or a backward glance walked calmly
down the village street boldly flaunt-
ing the blue foulard in the place of ex-
pected weeds she deposited the keys in
the office of mr smith promised to
write as soon as settled committed what
appeared to be a major operation in con-
cealing the large roll of bills which her
lawyer counted out on the worn rose-
wood table and betook herself to the
commercial house for her last meal in
mayfield

  eight oclock found her installed in the
train answering with matter of fact gen-
tility the questions of the friends gath-
ered to see her off john had not ap-
peared and she began to hope against
hope that her departure was to be merci-
fully ignored by her indignant relative
but such an easy evasion was not to be
hers john peck had titned and planned
his appearance he blustered in just as
the cars shocked together with the first
jar of departure snatching up the new
suitcase he sent it flying through the
open window narrowly missing the
heads of the assembled villagers gath-
ered on the platform instinctively miss
peck snatched the cat-basket to her
breast as her brother seized her roughly
by the arm and jerked her from the seat
with the intention of rushing her down
the aisle and off the train

  but not for nothing had she foreseen
this day and assured herself a protected

escape as her resisting little body was
propelled toward the platform the con-
ductor and mr elisha smith attorney-
at-law arose to interfere and they were
not without a sympatlietic understanding
of miss peeks feelings

  upon what authority demanded the
lawyer

  john peck get off this train snarled
the conductor you aint got no call
to interfere with your sister shes free
white and twenty-one aint she he
reached up to the bell cord and the train
jarred to a stop put him off will ye
eli he growled this trains goin
somewhere and shes on her way

  protesting and furious john peck was
hustled to the ties the guard gave the
signal the train moved on

  flustered and red her neat bonnet
rakishly awry miss peck sank again into
the red velvet seat

  well thomas she laughed excited-
ly were off she laughed again the
words had such a sportive sound she
repeated them as she stroked the wild-
eyed cat were off

  with unabated relish she traveled
through the night changed at a musty
junction and eventually arrived at her
destination in the pale dawn hours she
sat in the station waiting-room wonder-
ing at its immensity at the people at the
number and speed of the trains at the
news depots the restaurants the cah
stand it was all new and of absorbing
interest at half past seven when she
judged it would be safe to assume that
the day was well started for everyone
she called a cab consulted a newspaper
clipping and directed that khe be driven
to the hotel arrived at its carven por-
tals she was dazed by its magnificence
a liveried doorman possessed himself of
thofhass basket and she entered the
halls of splendor she was quite self-
possessed however when she stepped up
to the desk and with assurance sharp-
ened by anxiety demanded to see miss
margot fontaine


her groove

  the red-eyed night clerk who was not
yet off duty looked at her and chuckled
as he glanced at a board covered with
mystic signs left word not to be
called till eleven-thirty

   is she sick  inquired the elderly in-
genue

  not sos you could notice it the
clerk replied stoppin here he in-
quired

  of course i am miss peck snapped
back

  sign there he whirled the register
at her front he called

   if you please she agreed with lofty
detachment

  please what inquired the mystified
clerk

  a front room she retorted in the
glow of her deliverance from bondage
she almost hoped a front room was ex-
tra-expensive

   the clerk stifled a laugh and tossed a
key to the grinning bellboy four
thirty-six he ordered any baggage
miss

  im going out to buy some this noon
she assured him with dignity

  a desk telephone rang he picked up
the receiver oh three sixty-one-yes
hold on a minute he called after the
new arrival its miss fontaine-
wants her coffee in her room all right
say tell miss fontaine that miss peck-
miss elizabeth peck of mayfield-is
here to see her    yes ill hold the
wire    tell her to come right up
all right    fror show the lady to
three sixty-one and tell the floor maid
to make up four thirty-six elevator to
the right miss

  both thomas and his owner suffered
from the sudden ascension had a stom-
ach been permissible in an unmarried
lady miss peck would have clutched
hers in squeamish terror

  she had hardly recovered from the
shock when the bellboy knocked on a
numbered door which was opened by a
negro maid a flutter of blue chiffon a

tousle of brown curls and a flash of lace
cap buried itself on miss pecks lean
bosom in her emotion thomas was for-
gotten and his basket bumped to the
floor while the old maids yearning arms
closed over the slim shoulders that
strained close to her

  mary allen well well mary al-
len she repeated over and over in a
voice grown suddenly husky and sweet

  the girl threw back her head tossing
aside the concealing frills and curls and
revealing a face the loveliness of which
the faint traces of the last nights make-
up seemed to enhance rather than mar

  how good of you to come how did
you find me  i-i thought of going over
to mayfield to surprise you but i
couldnt on account of the theatre
were here only three days and were
giving five performances the words
tumbled from her lips as she led miss
elizabeth into the room drew up a chintz
armchair and climbed back into bed
oh she continued her face growing
pink with earnestness im so glid you
did come i felt so mean that i hadnt
written you you dont know-it makes
all the difference in the world but tell
me all about yourself how did they let
you off

  they didnt said miss peck sud-
denly reverting to her defiant manner
john threw my bag out of the car win-
dow lucky it wasnt thomas-oh
where is thomas

  the broadly smiling maid laid the bas-
ket on the bed

thomas exclaimed mary allen
alias margot fontaine not old tom
no but the dead spit of him its his
great-grandson and very tame and affec-
tionate but just a mite nervous

  the girl dumped the offended feline
on the bed and exclaimed in admiration
oh mattie look

  heres yer coffee miss the serv-
ant set the tray on the bed this is
sorter early fer you-all yer better take
it while its hot
ethel watts mumford



  a frown darkened the girls bright
face

  i couldnt sleep she explained i
was worried and-and-restless oh
im so glad you came her eyes sought
the older womans face adoringly
tell me the worst she burst out
how short are you going to stay with
me  when do you have to go back-the
very last minute

  im never going back at all said
miss peck if you dont mind mary
ill travel with you awhile if i wont be
in the way i made up my mind when
i seen the paper sayin you was here in
the glory hallelujah company but i
didnt know how i could make it so i
didnt send no word

  what have you eloped for good
how wonderful miss fontaine
bounced with delight

  miss peck put away her hands again
with her lingering folding gesture
yes she said i sorter cleaned up on
what i seen was my duties we all got
our just burdens but theres them thats
unjust mr paul wrastled with me and
john tried to shanghai me but i seen no
reason to give up i told em i hadnt
ever found my real groove in life but i
meant to find it i dont see why it aint
possible to do right and what you want
to at the same time i notice the men
seems to manage it

  did they know you were coming to
me demanded mary allen

  sakes no mis peck shivered at
the thought that zittd have finished it
why my dear since youve been a play
actress your name aint mentioned cept
by the real bad boys miss peck
laughed an amused tolerant laugh

  but mary allens face flamed

  well i like that she exclaimed
then her eyes grew troubled whats be-
come of cousin hilda safford she in-
quired after a moments pause

  why after you went she married
lef taylor they live in the old taylor
mansion up ridge street

  has she ever asked for me said
mary her voice lowered

   no but youve got no call to keep
her on your feelins mary if ever a
woman nagged a girl into takin the bit
in her teeth your cousin hilda nagged
you it was just jealousy mary because
youre purty and mary-she paused
to feast her eyes on the tousled vision of
beauty before her-if she could see you
now shed up and dti miss peck
sighed a sigh of utter content it just
rests me to look at you i dont know
what the lord put into me to make me
love purty young things so but i do all
my life ive loved em-flowers an peo-
ple an cats an silks an satins an ba-
bies an pictures an gold frames why
mary dear its that strong in me that
ive passed the fish house at night-
that was before the town went dry-and
just seen the lights through the windows
shining on all that bar-glass an biue an
green an yellow bottles an heard that
big music-box gcin an ive just ton tied
to be a man an go in there an see it all
an hear it mary do you know in all
my life ive never had any fmt ive
never had a laugh that didnt have a bite

   mary put out a smooth beringed hand

  miss elizabeth i wonder- wonder
did you need me as much as i needed
you you-youve had the courage to
see straight to fight your way against
your environment because you saw you
were in wrong oh miss elizabeth
ive got to do that too i know you
dont understand but never mind that
not nowr at least if john threw your
wardrobe out of the window weve got to
go shopping havent we ill get right
up she was already kicking her slim
feet into the worn blue satin mules at the
foot of the bed

	in a daze of happiness miss peek
watched the erstwhile marv allen grow
in beauty under matties skilful fingers
such shining boots with white kid tops
and such a simple tailored suit of blue


her groove

with sudden sophisticated dashes of
color such artfully plain hair under its
tilted turban  it was all perfection-en-
hanced by the faint perfume of powder
and aromatic essences the toilet that
consumed an hoar and a half seemed to
complete itself with magical rapidity to
the fascinated eyes of miss peck thus
and so would she dress from patent
leather tip to feather tip from pink
crepe de chine to gray fox fur she
whose life had been buckramed in chal-
lies prints and astrakhan doth

  mary caught up a diamond wrist watch
from the dressing-table and absently
shook back her cuff then she changed
color and put down the trinket as the
telephone rang

  see who that is she ordered

  how very purty miss peck picked
up the watch with awe it was so small
and seemingly fragile eleven oclock
she exclaimed my mary you must
use shorter hours than we do down to
mayfield

  its mr robert wants to see you
miss mattie almost whispered the
message says he on his way up

  mary hesitated then shut her lips
firmly

  all right mattie carry those tilings
into the alcove and pull the curtains
she tossed a pair of pink satin corsets
into an open trunk and closed the lid
then she turned again to her visitor
its mr thomas-he wrote the play
hes been traveling with the company so
that he can make what changes he wants
before we strike a big town he-he-
wants me to have the lead in the new
piece hes working on

  there was a knock on the door fol-
lowed almost instantly by the entrance of
a tall well groomed man remotely
threatened by the forties his deeply
lined face was attractive but for a twist
of bitterness in his thin lips that was
belied by the shrewd gentleness of his
eyes he started as his glance noted the
newcomer

  i beg pardon he said as if conscious
and somewhat ashamed of the abruptness
of his entrance

  oh good morning robert miss
fontaines voice was thin and clear as
glass this is miss peck-my very dear
friend in fact my only friend in what
used to be my home town shes come
to me to be my companion

  oh he said noncommittally

  miss peeks heart warmed toward the
man who appreciated mary allen

  mary s sweet enough to say as i can
travel with her an not be in the way
she beamed im sorter huntin for my
groove you see ive never been out of
mayfield before and ive never been so
happy either

  miss peck-mary sought and found
her gloves-was good to me always
when i needed goodness when i ran
away she stood by me and helped me
and when i needed money she scrimped
herself and sent it to me shes my good
angel mr thomas her dark-lashed
eyes met his with a swift look of mean-
ing

  angels are very necessary sometimes
-in our business there was a touch
of irony in his voice and a quick re-
sponse to the challenge of her look then
he turned courteously i shall be de-
lighted to include you miss peck we
had planned miss fontaine and i to
take a little run into the country before
the matinee youll come of course

  of course said mary quickly miss
peck was puzzled at the ring of defiance
in the tone

  the authors keen eyes were traveling
covertly over every detail of the new
companions face and figure he looked
as if he wanted to sneer and yet the
kind tired eyes smiled reluctantly miss
peck felt flustered as if somehow she
needed to explain her presence

   ran away too she stated boldly

  indeed  when  he inquired politely

  why just now i dont know as id
have had the courage if i hadnt helped
ethel watts mumford



  mary when she run off but i remem-
  bered and i kept telling myself that
  mary was all right shed found her
  groove and why shouldnt i you see
  mr thomas you dont know what it is
  to be brought up a woman everythings
  your duty if youre a woman an lots
  of duties that wouldnt grind so hard if
  they was shared get laid onto some one
  woman in the family an after a while
  you only got courage enough to keep
  those crosses goin an then you cant
  believe how hard it is to step out with-
  out a burden an look for what right-
  fully youve hankered after im sure
  it aint wrong to do your duty and be
  happy too if you can find it to do

    miss peck stopped short her sud-
  den burst of confidence to a stranger ap-
  palled her but his sympathetic attentive
  silence drew her on

    i dont think mr thomas quite un-
  derstands women marys voice was
   again brittle and thin he-hes per-
  haps a little cynical he doesnt know
  how hard it is-to-to be a woman i
  think hes always thought that because
  i ran away from-yon wouldnt call it
  home miss elizabeth would you-
  that-that- oh well lets be going
  she turned away helplessly

    but miss peck was too startled at the
  last suggestion

    why she just couldnt stay in may-
  field why mr thomas mary allen
  always was a heart of gold it was just
  that she was pretty an so full of life that
  there was them who should have been
  her friends that werent why for
  meanness hilda safford hasnt got her
  like an hilda safford was marys guard-
  een oh mr thomas you mustnt think
  because she tuck to play actin that there
  was any bad in her why i know how
  hard she worked an starved she
  stopped again and looked puzzled at the
  man before her why she murmured
  i thought it was just us poor ignorant
  countries who held by them ideas i
  didnt think there was city folks so plum

foolish-but-well-i guess now as we
two run-aways can take care of each
other-that is if youre sure i wont be
in the way

  mary put a shaking arm about her
friends shoulders

  youre just a-a dear she whis-
pered

  mr thomas smiled whimsically

  well people lets get out dont
forget margot youve got to stop
at the theatre and see marslo theyre
changing the curtain in the second act
and the new costumes for the third act
interpolated song came last night

  she nodded absently as she preceded
them into the hall miss peck glowed
this was more exciting than pink silk
underwear the theatre in the morn-
ing when only theatre people were al-
lowed  it amazed her that mary allen
seemed rather bored

  as they walked down the dingy alley
to the stage door miss peck experienced
all the thrills of a conspirator fire es-
capes freckled scenery men in overalls
rushing stiff banks of artificial flowers
the chill of housed stale air-here was
adventure at last

  in the darkling depths of the stage a
piano sounded a loud voice cried an im-
perative now all together and a burst
of girlish voices rose in a swinging rag-
time tune

  thats a hummer that new number
the playwright nodded his satisfaction
and i had to fire cottlin almost to
make him rehearse it run along mar-
got and get it over with dont take all
day

  in a blind daze of happiness miss peck
followed in the wake of the star but
hung back shyly as with businesslike
directness miss fontaine buttonholed a
stout and protesting gentleman miss
peck glanced over her shoulder and gave
a little gasp of delight was this
heaven

  a long windowless room was illumi-
nated by a brilliance of electric bulbs
	her groove

that shone and glittered on spangles and
tulle satins and sequins reds blues
greens-all the colors of the rainbow in
prismatic showers in the far corner a
half-dressed girl stood before a kneeling
colored woman who deftly adjusted a
too voluminous costume to the contours
of the prospective wearer the girl was
pretty with a coarse picturesqueness that
fitted well with the parrot brilliance of
her surroundings

  miss peck sighed with delight here
at last was beauty light color youth all
the things she had worshiped from afar
with such longing the shine of the
artificial light on bare necks and arms
the gloss of rippled hair with its keen
high lights the contrast of the maids
brown profile against the lemon yellow of
a tinseled cape-it was romance

  you lookin for miss french the
colored attendant inquired she aint
here yet blamed if she hasnt got the
pip most of die time she grumbled
this showll ditch if they dont get a
wardrobe woman as sticks on the job

miss peck murmured

  the woman glanced at her surprised
nodded acceptance and turned to thread
a needle from an orange spool

  oh there you are it was marys
voice behind tyer i thought id lost
you what aie you doing in the chorus
dressing-room 

  oh gasped miss peck aint it
beautiful aint it beautifuli-i
cud just set here forever an see all them

all with my fingers

  mary allens face flickered with
amusement and sobered to sympathetic
earnestness

  why ldo believe you were born to
be a wardrobe woman why miss eliz-
abeth perhaps its your groove she
looked into her companions ecstatic face
and her own saddened with memories
 and what a friend youd be to them
miss elizabeth why youd be a god-

send you would you and your dear big
goodness i-well have to think about
that why you-youd mother them
all

  with a tramping of feet on the stairs
aud giggles at the door the released cho-
rus entered the dressing-room with a shy
greeting to miss fontaine-blondes bru-
nettes redheads pick ford curls and
dutch bobs tall and pony glittering
in their new feature costumes their
young stir and bustle was like the noisy
chittering of birds if a contented hen
could smile her expression would doubt-
less duplicate that on miss pecks face

  regretfully she turned threading her
way amid the maze of props to the
stage entrance with its mail rack and
the cubby of the guardian of wonderland
but even as she turned into the narrow
entry the door opened with a vicious
slam silhouetted against the light tall
gaunt and menacing stood john peck

 well his voice boomed in the
echoing hall so heres where you are
disgracin me disgracin yourself oh
it didnt take me long to find ye when
i heard that mary allen was here mas-
queradin as miss fontaine i come in
on the first train this mornin and the
hotel they sent me here and lemme

  mary allen pushed past her friend
and faced the intruder

  john peck she ordered sharply go

miss elizabeths coming with me and
youll not interfere with her-do you un-
derstand 

  i wont wont i he jeered let

  tylary fell back a few short paces

snap

to do with you john peck-never for
what ye dare to say against mary allen
neither me nor my friends nor my cat
nor my money is none of yours
thank you miss peck a calm
voice behind them spoke and robert
thomas stepped forward with a cour-
teous inclination he passed the two
women mr peck he drawled i
want to explain something and ill see
that that explanation is in every paper
to-morrow miss fontaine or miss al-
len-i dont in the least care which has
done me the honor to consent to become
my wife i think in view of your very
enlightening insults the sooner the bet-
ter

  mary with a sudden choking gasp
turned and buried her face on miss
pecks shoulder her whole body was
tense and the hands that clutched her
friends thin arms were shaking

  and now that thats understood mr
peck ill add that your sister will be our
very welcome guest and ill remark
that if you importune her in any way
it will be the worse for you

  john peck laughed

  ye can tell all that to the marines
he jeered but ill take that fool woman
outer your clutches if i hev to hev her
judged incompetent

  john peck john peck  miss eliza-
beths voice rang with menace if you

quiet over to boston an whats more
when some as i know of finds out about
that there boston account i guess youll

learn to pay yer honest dues an leave
them thats only askin to live honest in
their own groove alone

  a look of blank amazement settled on
john pecks face his clenched hands
relaxed and began to fumble nervously
at his pockets he moistened dry lips
cleared his throat and stepped back

  you can go to perdition  he croaked
yer no sister of mine

  he heaved his broad shoulders through
the narrow doorway and the clack of his
retreating steps sounded in the alley

  robert thomas turned the hand
that he laid on marys heaving shcalder
was very gentle

  i guess you were right lie said soft-
ly ive-my vision has been wrong-
about women

  the girl turned to him with a sob

  miss peck smiled benignly on them
both with the sweetness of one who
knows no guile then her lips twitched 
her rusty laugh broke out

  my she ejaculated werent it just
providcnce that i guessed right ive
always been certain he was miserin over
to boston-but i didnt know till i saw
his jaw plumb fall off

  giggling and nudging like a boarding
school released the show girls began to
riot down the chute the turbulent
stream sobered respectfully as it bubbled
past the author and the star and broke
again into ripples of talk and laughter
as young feet danced down the hard
flagstones to the street

  miss peck sighed happily

  aint they sweet-aint they just
sweet i wonder how all their mothers
can do without em my it must be
lonesome when they go she sighed
again law it jest rests me to look at
em pears like i found my groove
the playwright turned toward her the
light of sudden understanding in his eyes

  as i live he exclaimed ive got you
-im on ill be hanged if you arent
the mother superior of the chorus
thats what-the mother superior
a leaf from lifes notebook

by lillian bennet-thompson

t ike a statue he stood there silent motionless while the traffic surged and

    roared behind him and a steady stream of pedestrians poured by in front he
was very tall-over six feet-with a pair of enormous shoulders and long powerful-
looking arms on the palms of his huge hands were great yellow callouses showing
in striking contrast to the whiteness of the skin it seemed strange that one who
had so evidently performed heavy manual labor should have skin so white and
smooth

    his face with its rugged irregular features might have been carved out of
stone so expressionless it wfes his back was braced against a lamp-post and in
one hand he held a slender sheaf of lead pencils

    his hat was pulled well down over his forehead he seemed to be looking fixedly
at the ground but the eyes beneath the lowered lids were sightless and the skin
about the empty sockets-skin pasty-white with that waxy hospital pailor-was
thickly sprinkled almost pitted with powder marks it was as if he wore a blue-
black mask over the upper part of his face

    occasionally someone in the busy hurrying throng would stop and press a
coin into his hand and then he would hold out the pencils and murmur two for
five but no one ever took one it was not the pencils they wanted nor did they
dream that die vender would have given much had they bought his wares

    how could they know of the storm of shame and humiliation that raged in his
soul how suspect that every penny bestowed in kindly charity inflicted a deeper hurt
than had the blast at the powder mill which had robbed him of his sight

    charity that was it he was nothing now but a beggar a parasite subsisting
upon the bounty of others he whose splendid strength had been his one pride he
who was tireless whose iron muscles had rejoiced in the performance of mighty
feats was as helpless as a little child oh the degradation of it

    and yet-he must live he must have food and clothes and a roof to shelter him

    even now he could hardly realize that there could be no more light for him
that this thick impenetrable darkness must endure forever in the hospital when
they had told him that he would be blind he had still hoped against hope surely
when the bandages were taken from his eyes he would be able to see it could not
be possible that his sight was quite gone it would come back gradually it was
only when day had followed day and week had followed week that his bewildered
mind finally grasped the appalling truth blind totally blind forever 

    hopeless despairing he had wanted to die-had tried to die but the strength
that had been his pride and joy mocked him now he was too vitally alive to die
he must live on-and since he could not work he must beg

    and so he stood there while the traffic surged and roared behind him and a
steady stream of pedestrians poured by in front-stood there motionless silent with
a stolid impassive iace and a heart full of bitter gnawing pain

the charlatan

    a novelette
    by henry payson dowst

i

af course kickin doesnt get me
anything said strickland bit-
terly but i cant help telling
you its the mistake of your life

  he leaned forward and caught at a
hand which the girl snatched away hast-
ily

  no said anna polenka softly no
it doesnt help you a bit with me to knock
steve you ought to be a better loser

joe

  the porch was narrow and rather close
to the street but screened by a mass
of some tliickly-leaved heavy-growing
vine that spread fanwise from post to
post the air of the summer night was
hot and leaden anna could hear the
thready notes of a cheap phonograph
down the street grinding ragtime from
a defective record

  i suppose so agreed joe still i
hate to see you throw yourself away on
a fellow that-that-

  you better be careful warned anna
where did you get your license to pan
steve rivers hes got five hundred
dollars saved up in the bank thats
more than you can say and he has a
good job too

  listen anna joe said you can
call me a bad loser if you like i made
a game fight and lost out i wish i could
say it was to a better man theres lots
of fellows in this world might make -ou
abetter husband than me and i wouldnt
blame you but steve rivers is a-

well he just aint fit for you i know
him bettern you do i guess theres
things about him i wouldnt tell you all
i got to say is throw me down if you
want to but for gods sake dont marry
steve because if you do youll regret it
as sure as im standing here

  joe had begwn to move toward the
porch steps

  i always liked you joe honestly
said anna i liked you sometimes so
much i wasnt sure whether id take
steve or you i hoped wed part good
friends but we cant il you dont be-
have nice i know its hard for you
but youll get over it i wouldnt won-
der if in time youd be glad i decided
to marry steve youll see lots of girls
nicer than i am-prettier and everything
then youll forget about how much you
cared for me or else wonder how you
could ever have been so foolish so be
a good boy and dont spoil it all by knock-
ing the man that won out

  but you dont understand began
joe argumentatively then he stopped
short and made a hopeless gesture aw
whats the use a man that would try
to argue with a womans a fool he
turned and clumped heavily down the
steps to the sidewalk and was gone with-
out even the formality of a good night
anna stood and watched him through the
chinks between the leaves of the screen-
ing vine then she sighed and went
gloomily into the house and up to her
room to bed

  anna polenka s father was a laborer




the charlatan

in the tudbury mills a thrifty immigrant
from one of those far lands beyond
the central empires of europe in the
thirty years of his residence in america
he had managed to save from his wages
enough money to pay for the little home
in which he and his family lived of
seven children anna was the youngest
all the rest were married and radizlov
polenka had already been presented with
several grandchildren anna helped her
mother about the house and worked as
stenographer in the office of mr gil-
christ manager of the tudbury mills

  the girl was beautiful-dark with
large round eyes in which seemed at
times to dwell the mysteries of an un-
plumbed soul her hair black and shin-
ing she had tortured into the latest
fasliionable wave her lips a carnation
red smiled to show an amazingly white
set of absolutely perfect teeth she pos-
sessed rich coloring an almost olive dark-
ness of skin as clear and smooth as satin
with warm tints of pink her figure
not yet fully formed was roundly slen-
der graceful as waving grass firm as a
young sapling of beech

  this vividness of color the red and
olive tints the black and glossy hair
were not racial for many of her fathers
nationality were blond like the occa-
sional american-bred girl of the dark
type the slav girl wfas a throwback to
some remote ancestral tribe a drop of
whose swarthy blood had lived down
through the generations at last to burgeon
forth in her warm check

  anna was however as much an amer-
ican as the other children with whom
she had grown up in that small manu-
facturing town her habits her speech
her mode of thought had been molded
by environment she knew but few
phrases of the native tongue of her
parents and used them seldom in the
public schools she associated with girls
and boys whose parents were of all the
races that go to make up our polyracial
nationality

  the polenka home was small common-
place and comfortable a cheap two-
story house not very well built but quite
like the other houses in the same neigh-
borhood it had been last painted white
with trimmings of giddy yellow which
time had mercifully subdued the nar-
row front piazza sagged somewhat its
supporting posts settling deeper and deep-
er into the ground as years went by
at the back polenka had a small garden
plot in which he annually raised a variety
of kitchen vegetables and a few flowers
behind some lengths of drooping wire
netting a dozen hens lived their uninter-
esting if useful lives

  the interior aspect of this dwelling
was consistent with its exterior the
furniture was cheap much worn unin-
spiring the carpets were faded with
age and lacked nap in many spots on
the wralls hung pictures lithographed in
contrasting colors framed in oak some-
times dingily ornamented with silver-
gilt at the windows were coarse lace
curtains quite clean and in fair repair
the air of the house was usually per-
meated with some odor of homely cook-
ing on mondays the smell of soapsuds
filled the rooms on friday the aroma
of fried fish impinged upon ones nos-
trils

  not so long ago this house had been
full of children but since the last of
annas unmarried sisters had been taken
to wife by jim broom who kept the
meat market half a block up the street
only polenka his wife and anna re-
mained

  it aint bad- polenka said remov-
ing his heavy boots and curling his tired
toes by the kitchen fire-it aint bad to
have a little peace and quietness eh

  not so much work agreed his wife
but god knows its lonesome often
i wish some of em was back

  we gave them a good home long as
they stayed with us said polenka com-
placently this was true there had
never been a day even when his family
henry payson dowst



had been at its numerical peak when
ivienka had not seen tlrat all had enough
to eat warn clothes good beds he had
done well

   i hope annall keep the reliows away
from her a while said mrs polenka
not mnch chance i guess hut shes dif-

 nrrm- 	

ierent

  yes sa-d pblenka id miss her
the worst of any of em shes drtieren 
thats true shes got brans anna has
maybe shell marry some rich feller

  yon cant tell shes odd she reads
books lots of books she dont much
go to movies like the ethers do often

i	look at her and wonder what is shes
thinking of shes so quiet

  a good girl said pttfenka hghting
his pipe

  a good girl treated annas mother
if she does marry i hope she cet a
husband tbit wifl treat her nice if he
didnt id be sorry for her

	maybe some one wen id need to be
sorry for the husband replied polenka
grinning

  that night when joe strickland had
gone angrily away anna climbed the
stairs to her room under even her light
tread the stairs creaked dismally the
night was hot and the house stuffy

  anna disrofeed slowly sitting on the
edge of her bed her dresses hanging
on chairs or on hooks along the wa
some snapshots of her friends an infirm
ten- is-racket tied with a bow of bloc rib-
bon over the bureau three or four school
bags- ese rave the room a certain in-
dividuality anna had shared it with
her most recent fy married sister the
rnrnitnre was of ash with a great deal
of the varnish gone such as it was
there was enough on tire rocking chair
lay a cushion a trifle dingy embroidered
with the letters standing for tudbury
high school

  when anna lighted the g and took
eft her clothes and put on her  i jhtg  wn
she surveyed the room with a queer mix-
ture of emotions

   in spite of the fact that this had been
her bedroom for some years sle had
never cared much for it vaguely there
stirred within her a sense of the em-
roonfaoeness of this room she had
never been contented in it her sister
who had married jim broom was now
living in a house that differed from the
pojenka domicile only in the matter of
newness anna did not want to marry
a man who would give her nothing bet-
ter than this her mother regarded her
daughters room as bordering upon the
luxurious but anna was snve that if
she chose the right husband tlere were
elegancies to which she might reasonably
aspire and of which her mother had
but slight conception

  a phonograph playing die latest dance
record did not satisfy annas craving
for melody a lithograph of a very red
cow drinking green water ou of a brook
on the banks of which pink daisies grew
in wild profusion was somehow lacking
having been brought up cm this sort of
thing the girl should have become habitu-
ated to it but she never had

   she -was hllcd v--jtli ihsoooteat- she
tdr both ungracious and ungrateful and
would not for the world have allowed
her parents to know she was anything
but perfectly happy nevertheless she
did not intend to marry into another
home like her fathers

  joe strickland as a freight dert at
the tttdburi raiimad station he was
not only clerk ite assisted at certain limes
o the day in unloading cars of conmodi-
ties a task which wore tajknssts on
hi hands and sometimes tore his dotbes
joe was good-looking jovial rather
domineering and his pa was three dol-
lars a day to anna poseska three dol-
lars a day meant a small rented house
cheaply famished and garishly orna-
mented like her own or that of her sis-
ter

  joe loved her of course but steve
rivers who worked in the tudbury
national bank got twenty-five dollars a


the charlatan

week and had he said a savings account
of five hundred dollars steve was then
a man of substance and prospects he
had made a start in life if she married
steve they could go to board at the
-tudbury house have a room and a bath
of their own and eat in the dining-room
where they would be waited on by young
ladies in starchy white aprons

  there was some class to that

  anna had liked joe strickland enough
to wish he had the bank job and that
steve were the freight clerk that would
make tilings ever so much better but
of course she was fond of steve and
when they had been married a while she
would love him very heartily especially
if his twenty-five a week grew to fifty
and they could expand their one room
and bath at the tudbury house into a
suite to include a parlor

  life was rather a complex affair
anna thought as she turned off the gas
and crept into bed from another room
along the corridor she heard her father
snoring she hoped steve would not
snore

   lying there in the dark thinking about
the future she had a little heartache
which she mistakenly diagnosed as a
headache she hoped she hadnt been
mean to joe strickland but it certainly
wasnt very generous of him to pan steve
rivers just because steve had certain
things which joe lacked it would have
been a lot nobler of joe to say something
magnanimous about his successful rival
anna was quite sure she should have wept
a bit if he had and fliis would have
been mournful and romantic and fasci-
nating

ii

  in spite of her parents hope that she
would keep the fellows away from her
a while anna polenka was before long
the wife of the opulent steve rivers
and went to live at the tudbury house
thus was realized her ambition to be

waited on by the starcby-aproned god-
desses of the tudbury house dining-
room and to avoid the fate of other girls
who wedded commonplace husbands and
lived in shoddy building-and-loan-asso-
ciation homes

  poor anna the fulfilment of her
dream was hardly less evanescent than
the vision itself the sojourn of mr
and mrs rivers among the small-town
splendors ofthe tudbury house lasted
but three or four months the five hun-
dred dollars steve had said he had saved
up proved to be a myth  and his salary
of twenty-five dollars a week was quite
inadequate to support his wife and him
in the style to which they wished to
become accustomed

  having been served with notice to
vacate the room and bath the couple
went to live in the paid-for dwelling of
radislov polenka laborer

  im glad to have anna back she
helps me so much around the house and
no longer now am  so lonesome mrs
polenka told her husband

 sure polenka agreed if they pay
regular the board money it aint so bad
but you want to watch out not for noth-
ing am i going to take care of them
with steve earning in the bank bigger
pay than i have ever made the two
of them should save

  if they wasnt in debt that steves
got no idea about money at the hotel
they owed over two hundred dollars when
they left and paying that up will take
forty weeks if they give five dollars a
week

  and anna with two diamond rings
big as strawberries and clothes and
hats- where you think they got such
things eh

  easy payments more debts if the
bank knew it maybe theyd fire steve
they have to be careful who they hire
handling other peoples money

  mrs polenka sighed anna the
youngest flower of the polenka brood
who had displayed the best mind of all
henry payson dowst



who had given promise of the brightest
future was married to a neer-do-well
he had fooled anna and all the rest
with his bank job and his big talk and his
lies about thriftily saved assets

  too bad she didnt marry joe strick-
land said polenka sucking at his pipe
a good boy i hear hes gone away
but some day he amount to something
sure enough

  too bad maybe steve learn a les-
son from this and turn over a new leaf
hed better it aint alone him and anna
hes got to support

 what

  sure anna told me yesterday
young fools well i hope steve
keep his job if he does all right no
more diamond rings no more fine clothes
but children is a good thing sometimes
you know how it was with me before i
got married the man puffed his pipe
thinking back across the years

  yes said his wife a good thing
you married right and got a family to
support you steadied down pretty
quick pit say that for you

  you take credit that you made a man
of me eh

 if anna made so good a man of
steve she would do well said mrs
polenka

  but anna did not do as her mother
had done probably it was because she
had inferior material to work on steve
rivers did not improve under respon-
sibility instead he went utterly to
pieces he was not the stuff of which
men are built

  one night steve failed to appear at
supper next day it transpirod that the
bank missed some thousands of dollars
in currency the sensation created by
news of this defalcation spread quickly
throughout the little city

  annarmed almost theatrical in her
distress that unsatisfied mystery in her
black eyes now became a sombre light
of pain and protest how she had
planned and schemed to get away from

this atmosphere of boiled cabbage and
shabby carpets this barren life of com-
monplaces  and the means she had taken
to escape it had ouly thrown her back
upon it chained her more inexorably to
it

  she had been as grossly letrayed as
any deceived woman could be married
or not a crimsoning shame flamed in
her cheeks when she thought of going out
into the streets of tudbury where her old
friends would look askance at the wife of
a felon in quite as unbearable a man-
ner as that in which they would have
regarded the dupe of some village love-
lace

  but when annas spirit crept back
from the blur of pain into the conscious-
ness of that new being in the bend of
her arm she realized suddenly that here
was the beginning of life for her this
realization was as yet chaotic amor-
phous intangible but it was there she
knew it meant fight not alone for her-
self but for the boy with what weapons
was she to make war against an adverse
fate she doubted not they would be
ready to her hand

  anna rivers was a good girl large
of heart possessing a soul of fundamen-
tal strength the things life made her
do in order to beat fate at its own game
were done because anna had if any-
thing too much imagination she was
an essential strategist an opportunist
and tliat she should take any unreasoned
step was quite out of line with her nature
true she had made a mistake in choosing
a husband on this basis but she must
adhere to that philosophy of life which
had come down to her with her olive
skin and sombre eyes making a mistake
of judgment does not invalidate the prin-
ciple of judgments it was simply that
she must try again

  having regained her strength she de-
voted herself for a time to the care of
her child and to those simple tasks which
were her share of the burden of house-
keeping
	the charlatan

  funny said mrs polenka id be 
feeling terrible with all thats hap-
pened this to her husband in one of
those intimate after-supper kitchen col-
loquies when anna was upstairs putting
little stanley her father insisted that
the name was stanislaus to bed

  do you want to feel terrible asked
polenka mildly

  no i dont want to but seems i ought
to with the disgrace of that steve and
all but with anna and the baby here

i dont remember when i been so con-
tented we get along good

  well you got a right something
is coming to you to pay for all you
been through if you can get any com-
fort i guess youre welcome to it any-
how we cant blame anna it aint her 
fault shes unlucky

  shes talking about a job

  maybe it would be a good thing to
take up her mind only she shouldnt
think i aint willing to take care of her
to-mdrrow she goes to see mr gil-
christ at the mills she thinks maybe he
will take her back

  shes got courage anyhow let her
try it if she wants to i suppose shed
feel more independent

  mr gilchrist was only too glad to
have anna back in his office she was
efficient and knew his work

  it seems like old times anna he
said to see that shiny black head of
yours around here im sorry for-for
your troubles child hut im certainly
glad to have you with me again

  anna smiled

  thats nice of you she said hon-
est it does seem good to be back i
was a little fool mr gilchrist now
ive got to pay but people like you make
it easier for me all the girls are good
to me and none of them said a word
about-about anything a few bad peo-
ple dont make a bad world do they
no anna they only make as appre-
ciate the good ones

   thats right mr gilchrist you

want to dictate maybe youll have to
go easy with me a few days till i get
back my shorthand  guess im rusty

  for a while anna polenka settled into
something like the routine of her pre-
marital days-getting up going to work
coming home again the same as of old
mrs polenka took care of the baby while
anna was away the child was a plump
lusty little thing dark like anna grow-
ing splendidly

  annas acquaintances said she was not
much changed from the old days they
did not mark the deepening of those
mysteries in her dark eyes which they
had never been quite able to understand
she was a little sobered by experience
still only eighteen years old she was
mature in voice in figure her touch
had a certain accuracy her decision-
were prompt and firm

  annas more efficient than ever said
mr gilchrist he was a fatherly soul
white-haired and rather benevolent a
business man of the old school who be-
lieved the employer ought to keep in
personal touch with as many of his em-
ployees as possible machinelike effi-
ciency had never been introduced into
the tudbury mills yet they made money

  in the mill office they called anna
miss polenka this was by her especial
request she wanted to be back on the
old basis as far as possible it is not
to be thought however that anna was
contented like a frog trying to climb
out of a well she had taken a one-foot
jump and fallen back two feet but
she could see the clouds drifting across
the blue disk of sky above the wells
mouth she was sitting quietly on a
bit of driftwood contemplating these
clouds and watching how pleasantly the
sun burnished their silvery edges they
looked very far away it was no use
making another desperate leap for free-
dom better to wait quietly for a while
fate might some day lower a bucket
in which she could steal a free ride to
daylight

   and if dictated mr gilchrist we
find it possible to pet sufficient cars we
shall arrange to make the shipment on
or about- why miss polenka-anna
child-whats the matter

  anna had ceased to take notes she
was gazing with a curious fixity at a
shiny paper weight on her employers
desk it was a globe of heavy glass lined
with quicksilver-a spherical mirror
in fact which gave forth distorted re-
flections of everything anna had seen
it hundreds of times for gilchrist had
kept it on his desk for years

  now however she was regarding it
like a person hypnotized her usually
full-colored cheeks were pale olive her
lips were parted her eyes wide-open and
staring

  anna anna persisted gilchrist
pay attention im die- say youre
not ill or anything

   the girl held up a warning hand

   dont she said please-its don-
ald

   donald repeated gilchrist don-
ald  what about donald 

  donald was his son a boy of about
eighteen

   it turns and turns and turns said
anna no its wheels and theres
something-a tree-a telegraph-pole-
oh

  she stopped and seemed to try to
tear her gaze from the silvered globe

  her employer showed marked irapa-
i tience

   what the devil  he grumbled the
t childs gone crazy say anna this is
i business hours no time for rehearsing
t private theatricals

   it is donald it is hes all white

	nd covered with dirt and theres blood
-blood ohis face-

   whats tfiat cried gilchrist what
r re you saying what sort of rig-
t larole-

   wheels and wheels and wheels and

blood and a telegraph pole and a little
white house with windows broken out
and nobody living in it-and a mail box
in front oh whats that name  bright -
man-brinkerman-

  brinkerson-brinkerson cried gil-
christ thatll be the old brinkerson
place where the family all died of diph-
theria two years ago good lord here
miss kennedy miss gates come here
quick miss polenkas fainted get her
into the rest room and call doctor white
ive sot to go

  he clapped on his hat and left the
office on the run out into the factory
yard fie rushed shouting for someone
to open the garage doors and the big
gates in the enclosure fence in five
minutes he was stopping before the home
of his own family physician

  youll think im loony he shouted
coming here and kidnaping you this
way-wild goose chase and all that
they went tearing through the suburbs
of tudbury defying all the local anti-
speed ordinances

  most uncanny thing that ever hap-
pened to me dont believe in any such
rot but my god suppose it should be
true suppose donald had been hurt
say doc how far would you call it to
that old deserted brinkerson place
matter of thirteen miles

  promise if nothing comes of this
youll never tell a human being said
gilchrist fancy my losing my head
all on account of the crazy vaporings of
a girl i guess her troubles have upset
her mind poor young one nice little
thing too shes the one that rivers
married and deserted-you remember
then came back to me-mighty spunky-
little thing

  gilchrist excited incredulous wild
with anxiety kept his foot on the ac-
celerator and the runabout bounced mad-
ly along the country road

  of course theres nothing to it   
great scott theres brinkersons


the charlatan

and- god doc the girl told the

truth

  in a small town like tudbury you
cant keep a thing like that dark anna
said she didnt remember what happened
except that as mr gilchrist dictated she
found herself looking at the shiny paper
weight and then she felt rather drowsy
and thought she wasnt really paying
careful attention to her employers dicta-
tion then next thing she knew she
was on the couch in the first-aid room
and the girls were rubbing her hands
and holding smelling-salts to her nose

  but mr gilchrist said that donalds
life had undoubtedly been saved by the
prompt arrival of the doctor at the scene
of the accident the boys car had
thrown a shoe and swerving crashed
into the telegraph pole he was ter-
ribly hurt but he would be well again
in time but if he had been allowed to
lie there in the road until picked up by
some chance passer-by he would assured-
ly have died

  all this amazed anna polenka no
less than it amazed her friends and the
repute of her exploit was a source of
some embarrassment because people
came to her to ask for the benefit of her
occult power for all sorts of reasons
anna said she had no occult power she
didnt understand it any more than they
did she wanted to be let alone she
was not seeking publicity

  privately however she became exceed-
ingly curious she wanted an explana-
tion and there was no one whom she
could ask she sought enlightenment in
books and was at once led into a literary
iabyrinth from which as long as she
lived she never escaped the bibliog-
raphy of the occult is endless bottom-
less and without horizon but anna
was a good reader in an infinite hay-
stack of opinion propaganda theory
doctrine and experience she found here
and there an occasional needle of truth

and likewise she learned that all who
professed to exercise occult powers who

claimed to tell fortunes or in any wa
elucidate the unknown were regarded
as charlatans and humbugs

  meanwhile she went her way pur-
suing the even routine of existence to
all outward seeming but having learned
that for certain types of mentality it
is possible to induce self-hypnosis
through the fixed contemplation of some
shiny object she stealthily possessed her-
self of a glass ball and in the privacy
of her room sought through its means
to adventure into the unknown the
result was a period of unconsciousness
lasting some time which frightened her
mother into a spasm and left anna with
a twenty-four-hour headache and a feel-
ing as if she had been doing hard manual
labor without rest

  however there were times when she
became what the books called highly
psychic these came at irregular in-
tervals the manifestations were as
quixotic as they were spasmodic

  she was invited to supper in the home
of a neighbor directly in front of her
stood a silver-plated sugar bowl anna
suddenly touched the hand of little molly
finney who sat next her and announced
in sepulchral tones that molly must be
kept from school next day the school-
house caught fire on the morrow and
some of the children had narrow escapes

  this is only one instance of a score
but when sadie sadlowitz came one eve-
ning to the polenka house and asked
if anna wouldnt please go into a
trance and tell her why moe feingold
had stopped keeping company with her
anna gazed in vain into the crystal
depths and sadie went home declaring
that she didnt see nothing wonderful
about annie rivers and she for one
would bet them stories about her being
a clear voynt was all bunk so there
now

  but the result was far different when
mrs irving van sicklen from the se-
lect part of tudbury came to annas
home in a limousine and told the girl
henry payson dowst



  a touching story of domestic infelicity
  mrs van sicklen was lovely gentle good
  as an angel anna polenka knew what
  it meant to have a husband ill-treat one
  and her heart went out in sympathy to
  her visitor in the subdued light of the
  polenka parlor she sat and held mrs
  van sicklens hand and talked softly to
  her but the crystal would yield noth-
  ing yet the woman was so insistent
  so distressed

    heavy-hearted anna went through the
  motions of what she had learned to call
  a sitting she couldnt bring herself
  to disappoint her visitor and so with
  some hesitation but using her native
  shrewdness and adroitness she patched
  together a demonstration that warmed
  mrs von sicklens chilled heart

    i see some sort of crowd said anna
  this woman-shes medium to dark-
  complexioned-

    dark said mrs van sicklen
hush said anna you mustnt
talk he met her some place where there
were lots of people-a reception i can
see people dancing-

    at a theatre party

    its the people on the stage that are
  dancing said anna hastily i get it
  now but he-he doesnt really care for
  her shes too-too shallow she-shed
  never hold him she isnt like you
  that is true said mrs van sicklen
  she has no depth-shes just pretty
  dont you notice it said anna
  pretend you dont care this is-is
  only a passing-er-phase

    out of the books she had picked up
the patter naturally and made it her
i own

    i see a lot of paper-paper paper

 paper do you write

    a little-poems and songs-

    to herself the girl said that was
r a long shot landed though

    then to her client keep writing
l it will lead to something perhaps it
i means fame-perhaps not it will-will
fcalm your mind you have talent

  and so it went at the end of half
an hour mrs van sicklen arose reas-
sured happy confident

  oh miss polenka she said i cant
tell you how much youve helped me
you will forgive my intrusion into your
home wont you i was in such dis-
tress 

  anna looked about at the shabby hang-
ings the cheap furniture the garish wall
paper home

  its nothing she said she felt like
a burglar honestly it was just be-
tween us mrs van sicklen i know how
a woman feels its sympathy between
two people like you and me people who
have suffered

  you mean its the sympathy that
makes the psychic manifestation possible
of course but i thought you went into
a trance

  oh no not always its the vibra-
tions you know people that are strong-
ly psychic vibrate in harmony and that
makes it unnecessary to employ the more
radical methods anna was mentally
grasping in the air for the right words
-and actually getting away with it

  its wonderful said mrs van sick-
len let me pay you

  oh cried anna her cheeks flaming
oh please please dont i couldnt
take it really i never could let
you-

  i have taken your time persisted
the lady i shall not feel that i can
come again if i am not to make it right
with you

  she laid some crisp banknotes on the
table and departed anna quite dum-
founded by this unexpected development
wondered afterward if she had been de-
cently polite

  then she looked at the money there
was as much as she earned at the factory
in a fortnight and she wasnt entitled
to it because she had fooled mrs van
sicklen cleverly adroitly-

  well mrs van sicklen had fixed her
own price if the sitting hadnt been


the charlatan

worth the money she wouldnt have left
it she was the best judge of what it
meant to her

  anna picked up the bills they repre-
sented new clothes for little stanley and
a dressing sacque her mother had said
she couldnt afford and a big glass jar
of smoking tobacco for her father

  she tucked the money into her dress
and went up to her room there be-
side her bed in his little crib lay stan-
ley pink and warm her baby her little
boy what was to be his future he
was her responsibility steve rivers had
unloaded it all upon her life was hold-
ing out the hand of a tax collector and
saying here young woman  pay up 
then simultaneously fate was ad-
vancing the money with which to pay

  anna leaned over the crib and lis-
tened to the gentle baby-breathing caught
the baby-warmth of the tiny sweet body
he was so delicate so fragile with his
soft cheeks and dark-fringed eyelids
and rumpled-hair there on the pillow
one tiny rose-leaf hand was upthrown
beside his head a hand that clutched at
the heart of anna polenka

  god she said to herself if im
clever enough how can i help it  shall

i	let him grow up like i did  when i
have a chance to give him things is
it right to pass it by if i could only
see into that globe and find out whats
best i can tell the others but i cant
do anything for myself

  she undressed and lay down in the
bed thinking and thinking after a
while she cried into her pillow

  you little cheat she called herself
you little faker charlatan humbug
youll never get away with it

  finally she fell asleep but it was
not before she had made a decision

iv

  as you walk along fifty-fifth street
approaching fifth avenue from the west
you pass rows of tall houses of brown-

stone with high front stoops many
of these houses possess a certain distinc-
tion giving evidence that their dwellers
are of more than average prosperity

  up the steps of one of them on a crisp
sunday afternoon in autumn trotted a
young man carrying a bulky kit bag
he rang the bell and awaited impatiently
the answer to his summons presently
a maid came and swung back the grilled
iron door admitting him into the white-
painted vestibule

  why its master stanley said the
maid

  is mother at home he demanded
passing on into the hall

  yes sir and shell be surprised to
see you she wasnt expectin you for
another week

  ill go to my room nora and you
can tell her ive come

  he bounded up the stairs and sought
his room on the third floor it was a big
comfortable apartment furnished and
decorated in boyish taste though with
a degree of luxury through an open
door he caught sight of a white porcelain
bathroom

 gee mused the new arrival
thats inviting its good to get back
dear little mumsy she always has
everything so spick and span

 he felt travel-worn and dusty having
come from more than halfway across the
continent hastily he disrobed and after
a shower and rubdown got into fresh
things standing before his dresser ad-
justing his tie with meticulous exactness
he heard a knock

  come in he called

  the door opened and a woman en-
tered she was a beautiful woman vital
glowingly alive in her smooth cheeks
delicately olive were the lovely tints of
youth her hair jet black shone in
lustrous waves

  but the wonder of her beauty lay
lareelv in her dark eyes richly brown
and now shining with the light of wel-
come
henry payson dowst

    stanley dear she cried and in-
  stantly she was in his arms

    mumsy little mumsy im so glad
  to see you  my arent you a wonder
  you look about twenty-five no one
  could believe you were the mother of a
  great cub like me

    it was true the woman seemed the
  personification of eternal youth she
  retained a sweet girlishness of expres-
  sion and years had not impaired the
  slenderness or grace of her figure she
  was clad in a gown of some dark ma-
  terial silken and rather clinging at
  i sight of her one instantly recognized
  in her garments a nice feeling for fash-
  ion that took from prevailing modes
  those effects which best suited her and
  somehow improved them by her adapta-
  tion

    you are a wonder cried stanley
  holding her at arms length none of
   the debutantes have anything on you for
  looksmumsy girl

    dont be silly dear im thirty-
j eight

    no one would believe it

   nora said you had come i was

 i reading-

    yes i told her to tell you i wanted
  to freshen up a bit they let me off
  the bridge job a week sooner than id
   ixpected so i hustled east to surprise
  you lets sit down and get tilings up
  o date howve you been 

    fine as always dear boy tell me
  iid you make good and do you like
  our profession  is it going to keep you
  nterested 

   marvelous most interesting profes-
   on in the world yes i think i did
  asteke good im to report downtown at
  e rms new york office for a new
  risignment right away theyre even

  	firing of sendjig me to china on a big
  trtiiroad constnjtoon job

  j oh honey so far when youve
    st got back 

    orders are orders old dear besides

   ink of the experience its great be-



  iug sent all over the world the firms so
  decent to me too im the only twenty-
  year-old engineer they have and they
  hand me responsibilities some of the older
  chaps would give their shirts for

  its spendid stan splendid im so
proud of you but it you go to some
far-away place-well i think ill close
the house and leave town i think ill
buy a little farm and have some chickens
and just live a peaceful old-lady exist-
ence back in the country

  dont be absurd mumsy still that
farm idea isnt so bad when i come
back maybe ill have a wad of money so
i can settle down with you and be your
farm superintendent as an engineer i
coud at least lay out a water supply and
keep your fences in repair

  small hope of that boy youll never
be contented to settle down-until you
marry and  hope that wont be so very
soon

  how arc you getting on mumsy
ive nearly a thousand dollars saved from
my salary that ive no use for do you
have money enough for everything you

want

  mrs gage looked sharply at her son
  why stanley what an idea

  well i didnt know living costs a
lot and  was a big expense to you while
i was in technical school ive some-
times wondered if the money father left
was enough you wont have to worry
after another year or two because ill
probably be making barrels one of these
days just now im not much help but
i want you to know i realize how splen-
did youve been and that i do fed a lot
of responsibility especially if-

  how you talk sonny mine there
isnt the slightest need of your worrying
about me ive plenty dear

  she spoke with such emphasis that the
boy was quite convinced but m her
soul the beautiful rs gage knew that
things were not as she had pictured them
stanleys education had cost her thou-
sands of dollars the fifty-fifth street


the charlatan

house was a big expense yet she loved
the comfort of it and shuddered when
she thought of giving it up

  there were bills unpaid that were past
due her credjt was still unimpaired
but she knew that unless payments were
made before long this condition would
not hold

  anna gage was in truth a creature
made for luxury to lie blissfully laie
in the morning to arise and bathe in
perfumed water tempered to perfection
by an assiduous maid to breakfast
daintily-these things were a habit
grown strong from indulgence

  somewhere in her memory awoke at
times the picture of a shabby house
ill-painted cheaply furnished of a room
from whose ashwood chairs large patches
of varnish had scaled of a home where
comfort went hand in hand with cheap-
ness-a good home it was true owned
outright by grace of endless payments
to the building-and-loan association

  but such pictures always made her
cringe well she had been generous
never a month went by without a check
mailed in a letter full of affectionate
messages anna gages conscience was
easy on that score

  she patted her sons big capable hand
as they sat together on a wicker cliaise
longue her warm cheek resting against
his shoulder her eyes full of a proud
light as she realized the manly strength
in the boys face suddenly she sprang
to her feet and confronted him he
looked up at her wide-eyed a little
startled

  why mumsy 

  money cried anna gage whats
money nothing stanley nothing ex-
cept a means to an end and with me
that end has always been you

  she dropped on her knees in front of
him and put up her arms about his neck

  boy boy she cried thank you
thank you for being what you are
 hank you for all youve tlone to justify
my love and my faith in you im so

proud of you so very proud of you
and you know youre all ive got dont
talk about money moneys done a lot
for us-but if i could have accomplished
the same thing by taking in washing
id have done it cheerfully  and id have
been happy and proud of my success
sonny boy

  to stanley there was something em-
barrassing about this unexpected show
of emotion he had never seen his
mother this way before he didnt
understand it not knowing what lay be-
hind it all words came with difficulty
and he felt the best he could do was to
tuck her face down against his collar
and stroke her hair and call her the lov-
ing diminutives that had always passed
current between them

  its been splendid of you he kept
saying splendid i know you would
do anything for me but pretty soon itll
be my turn and if you want to live
on a farm you shall have just the grand-
est farm in westchester county or long
island or anywhere ill buy it for you

  the dwelling of mrs gage was a
model of taste the rooms were of
good size cheerful artistically homelike 
there were pictures excellently chosen
-not in profusion but more than mak-
ing up in character what they lacked in 
numbers the rugs on the floors were 
soft and rich the furniture dainty grace-
ful yet sound and substantial there
were no heavy shrouding draperies but
instead hangings that rather inclined to
flufiiness indescribably feminine and for
that reason as charming as they were i
appropriate to anna gage

  but there was one room in the gage-j
home which differed radically from all i
the others-annas study

  it was in the middle of the house
and had no windows most of the fur- -
niture was of heavy dark wood in man
henry payson dowst



  eases elaborately carved in the centre
  stood a great flat-topped desk as solid
  as a mountain and seemingly as antique
  there were no pictures for the walls
  were covered with dark-hued tapestries

    the only light in this apartment came
  from a curious pierced metal lamp sus-
  pended from the ceiling by chains and
  this lamp was so arranged that its rays
  fell mostly upon the desk top when anna
  gage sat at this desk one saw her face
  quite vividly lighted against a background
  of half-penetrable gloom

   there were books on the desk and
 in cases near by old books many of them
 bound in leather already tattered faded
 like the integuments of a mummy it
 was quite possible to read a book lying
 on the ancient desk but in any other
 part of the room the types were quiie
 indiscernible

    in the exact center of the desk stood
  a globe of some translucent substance
  perhaps four or five inches in diameter
  this globe seemed to possess a certain
  iridescent opaline quality like a vast
  pearl but with more vivid fires it had
  about it something of aliveness one
  could not think of it as mere inert solid
  in it the rainbow colors seemed to ebb
  and flow to swirl and sweep like some
  restless molten liquid yet if you looked
  close you could not detect this motion
  it was an impression fantastic disturb-
  ing and quite intangible

    faintly throughout the room wafted
an odd mysterious odor subtly sweet
suggesting a delicately fragrant smoke
vet there was no censer no occult-look-
jing tripod or altar no suggestion of
 oriental rite or shrine the odor came
 and went in gentle waves now very
i noticeable now almost imperceptible

    anna gage sat at her desk and slowly
  turned the leaves of a book she looked
  very beaucful very alluring and there

	in the careiwly arranged light the rays-
   tery in her great sombre eyes was deep-
  ifned and enhanced

    a knock preceded the entrance of miss
  s-i s

 brooks the secretary who laid a slip
 of paper on the desk miss brooks was
 comely simply dressed the exemplifica-
 tion of absolute silence absolute circum-
 spection	

 she may come in said anna
 presently a young woman entered
 she was weeping more than that she
 was frightened

 sit down my dear said anna kind-
 ly you came from mrs bird

 yes miss-i mean missis

 what did mrs bird tell you

 i wint to her an towld her i-i
 heered iv a mrs gage that give people
 advoice and did she know you an
 she said she did an she give me the note
 to you so i come

 let me see your hand please

 the visitor extended a reddened palm
 at which mrs gage looked intently

 i sec she said

 yis maam replied maggie

 anna picked up the iridesceut globe
 and set it on a little silken cushion quite
 close to the edge of the desk

 now maggie she said look cn
 there very carefully and tell me what
 you see

 maggie shrank back

 oh i dont dare i dont dare
 nevertheless she managed to fix her
 gaze on the colorful depths

 anna laid a light hand on the girls
 forehead

 what do you see

 maggies eyes widened her mouth
 opened

 mv god she breathed its din-
 ny 

 anything else

 hes walkin walkin walkin an
 thitn thats wit him is follerin him
 an-

 the woman-what is she doing
 theres no woman-glory be theres
 no woman at all at all

 anna gage snatched away the globe
 and began to talk gently kindly and the
 excitable maggie made reply none of


the charlatan

these replies was without its significance
at the end of half an hour the girl arose

an may god bless you maam for
the comfort youve been to me this day
she said an how much do i owe you 
hush said anna run along now
and stop worrying

  but i want to pay you

  put an extra dollar in the poor box
at mass next sunday please give mrs
bird my love and ask her not to say
anything about sending you here you
know i dont do these things for money
the girl went away marveling one
of the fortunate few who gained admit-
tance into that dim chamber

  when she had gone anna gazed long
and deeply into the globe but its opaline
currents only swirled meaninglcssly be-
fore her eyes telling her nothing it
had always been so that strange clair-
voyance which she had at times been
able to exercise for the benefit of others
had never enabled her to see into her
own lifes mysteries

  poor maggie she routed poor
gullible creature a little hypnotism a
little sympathy a little shrewd adroit-
ness- lord help me what a cheat f
am

  miss brooks entered with a card
  yes  said anna ill see her

  far different from the previous caller
was mrs torville oxnard she swept
into annas study with a sort of assur-
ance that was dangerously close to
condescension

  my dear she cried how well
youre looking s

  instantly in mrs gages manner ap-
peared a certain restraint

  thank you im quite well

  ive called on such an important mat-
tf-r said mrs oxnard and its so very
intimate too she seated herself beside
annas desk i really must have your
advice youve always helped me so
wonderfully 

  anna surveyed the woman coolly she
was rather splendid in a striking way

her garments were costly on her hands
was a fortune in jewels anna knew
that her visitor was receiving the largest
alimony of any woman in new york

  its about-

  dont v cried anna sharply you
mustnt tell me i dont want you to tell
me youve no right to take a compara-
tive stranger into your confidence mrs
oxnard i cant accept that responsibil-
ity

  then how are you going to help me
if i dont tell you plainly the recital
of her case was something to which she
had looked forward

  your hand said anna simply

  she examined the lines intently and
meanwhile her mind was working with 
the precision of a clock she caught up
the globe

  quick she cried but not a word i
not a word i f you speak the spell will
be broken

  she placed a hand on the brow of her j
visitor and mrs oxnard bent her gaze 
hungrily on the beckoning liquid fires
within the sphere then too her eyes
widened and she would have spoken
but anna laid a finger on her half-
parted lips

  thats enough said mrs oxnard
as anna suddenly snatched aside the
crystal heavens what a revelation
she arose most extraordinary she
said amazing you grow more won-
derful every day my dear i cant tell
you how much youve helped me in the
last two years-going through that awful
trouble with me as if youd been my
sister t do so wish youd let me do
something for you cant i send you a
check 

  send a check for whatever you like
to the mount magdalen home for des
tute girls i cant take anything i
more than enough if i can help my
friends im only too delighted

  mrs oxnard with many protestation
of gratitude and promises to send t
check made her adieu she had scarcely
henry payson dowst



  gone when miss brooks presented her-
  self once more

     its the collector from the butcher
  she said quietly hes asking for a
  check

    oh brooksy what shall i do said
  anna my bank account is down to
  almost nothing and i shant have a re-
  mittance from the estate for another
  week be a nice girl and wheedle him
  for me will you and have him send
  up some ducks im simply crazy for
  duck do it for me brooksy-then
  youll be a duck too

    the discreet miss brooks withdrew
  silent unsmiling anna did not know
  or care by what method she persuaded
  the butcher to increase still further the
  amount of her indebtedness but there
  was the desired duck for dinner that
  night

    anna gage being made ready for bed
  with the deft assistance of her maid
  pondered the problems of life which
  were now mainly financial

    well she thought ive been in a
  hole before and pulled out i guess this
  one wont be any exception

    in another fifteen minutes she was
  sleeping the sleep of beauty in a fairy
  bed overhung with a canopy of satin
  daintily figured with scenes from a cer-
  tain shakespearean classic the theme of
  which was mainly concerned with the ad-
  ventures of a justly famous goddess

vi

    mr abner brownell millionaire
v clubman turfman speculator-he was
called all these things by turn in the
 society columns of the various sunday
q papers-sat in his office not far from
 wall street and read the morning times
i the market was quiet the raids in
v which mr brownell was quite deeply
rr interested we t doing almost nothing
the country was prosperous dividends
-ft were being paid with tiresome monotony
ir tabor was tractable

  the devil mused abner brownell
a chap might as well shoot craps with
the office boy as try to get any fun out
of this market

  he lighted a cigarette placed his feet
on his desk and occupied his mind in 
trying to decide whether he would take
a night train for the new brunswick
moose country or a coastwise ship for
cuba and the big havana cattle show
where he knew there would be some ex-
cellent racing

  the telephone claimed his attention

  who is it  he demanded lazily

  mrs gage replied the girl on the
desk

  all right hello anna gage how
are you  a pause i cant believe it
things down here are as quiet as the
place where mr gray wrote his elegy 
more pause who is it belcher and
that crowd do you suppose just like
em i didnt think theyd have the nerve
so soon after- still further pause

  if youd ever fooled me before i
wouldnt stir but youve been such a
brick- doesnt seem possible anything
should start in this market    you say
you feel it very strongly well anna
you know me i was just bewailing
the fact that things were so dull awfully
obliged heres where i get busy see
you in a day or two good-by anna

  the languid mr brownell was from
this moment transformed into a demon
of energy tn a twinkling the placid at-
mosphere of his office was charged with
the crackling currents of a tense ac-
tivity the telephone became excessively
busy office boys scurried madly gerks
tore around like wild animals in cages
brokers began to come in for orders
and go out again

  abner brownell sat in nis private of-
fice and glued his eye on the ticker tape
as it came chattering from beneath its
glass housing

  by george the little woman was just
in time he cricd softly she certainly
did hit it bless her heart another two


the charlatan

hours though and id have lost the
chance of a lifetime

   he began pouring orders into one after
another of live or six telephones his
face flushed with excitement he be-
came hoarse with much shouting al-
ways he returned to the ticker to read
the vibrant message of its purple-splashed
ribbon

  when the market closed that after-
noon he chuckled as he put on his hat
and went out to the street where his
town car waited

  to the uptown club he said

  brownell was a big man somewhat
spectacular exceedingly good-looking
and a famous bon-vbant his hair was
just beginning to gray his eyes keenly
blue revealed a shrewd intelligence
which was well supported by the square-
ness of his jaw under the close-clipped
mustache one saw however a mouth that
lacked something of the jaws invincible
strength it was a mouth that might
express a hint of the sensual or if one
saw it at its best a kindliness that belied
the cold pale light in the blue eyes
luxurious living had made abner
brownell a little overweight and marked
his face with a ruddiness the meaning of
which was unmistakable

   brownell dined with a couple of friends
and a stranger to whom they introduced
him a giant of a man with the unmis-
takable stamp of executive ability in his
high forehead his firm mouth and domi-
nant nose

  oh yes said abner ive heard of
you strickland youre the boy who
put c w  k on its feet eh youve
a nice property i hear

   weve a pretty good little road said
strickland modestly

  little road huh i dont call a
couple of thousand miles of the best
double-tracked right of way in the west
so very little and they tell me you did
it all strickland just cleaned out that
gang of crooks and made a real rail-
road of it some job

  we pay a dividend once in a while
said strickland shrinking from so much
eulogy

  after dinner stricklands friends took
him off with them to a theatre brownell
stayed at the club and read lhe eve-
ning papers the excitement on the
exchange had been so unusual that the j
news of it began under three-line heads
on the first page

  some clean-up he chuckled

  he ordered a drink which he didnt
need having had plenty with his dinner
and before

  darn it a club was a poor sort of
place when you were lonesome every-
one seemed to have an appointment
brownell became exceedingly restless
across his vision floated a pair of dark
brown eyes in which dwelt an alluring
mystery sometimes he thought a bit
pathetic what was it about anna gage
that baffled a chap so

  he had known her now for three or
four years and from time to time at
his request she had exercised for his 
benefit that extraordinary clairvoyance -
of hers she was a fascinating person- 
ality always she had held him at arms j
length but at this moment he became 
aware that she attracted him more than
anybody else in the world had ever done i
in his life he called a taxi first drop- s
ping down at a writing desk and scratch- 
ing something hastily on a strip of paper 
bound with other similar pieces in a small-
book this strip he tore out and thrust f
negligently into a side pocket

  twenty minutes later he ran up the
steps of the fifty-fifth street house and 
was admitted by the trim maid who
showed him into a dainty reception
room

  presently anna came in looking ex-
traordinarily beautiful her dark eyes
shining with friendliness

  it was good of you to come so soon
she said i read in the papers how
things went in the street to-day it was 
as i said wasnt it 
henry payson dowst



    lord if she wouldnt be so confound-
 edly impersonal

    this is a business call said brownell
  do you transact business here or in
  your-private office

    mercy said anna im not in busi-
 ness but if you want to go into the
 study its all right nevertheless she
 looked at the man sharply before leading
 the way to the inner room where the
 hanging light was burning making a
 round spot of brilliance in the centre
 of the room here she dropped into her
 accustomed seat and her caller took the
 chair by the side of her desk

   he pulled the check from his pocket
 and laid it before her she picked it up
 and read the amount then looked at
 brownell her eyes were wide with
 surprise

    but i cant accept it she said its
  too much

   five per cent said brownell i
 cleaned up a cool million to-day the
 tip was the best youve ever given me
 im awfully glad said anna but
 fifty thousand dollars-oh i couldnt
 how did it happen anyhow de-
 manded her caller you dont know
 belcher or any of those chaps

    it was one of the best manifestations
 ive ever had-truly i got up much

	earlier than usual this morning and al-
i though i hadnt thought of you for
a months-

 i thanks said abner

   -your name kept coming into my
 mind and i could see your face and
 v omehow i knew there was a message
 -r o i came in here and looked into the
  flobe and there i saw something-i cant
  describe it but i realised what it meant
 olo i got you on the phone

   wonderful said brownell incredu-
 u buslv anna youre a marvel youre
 irnore than wclcome to your commission
 that ought to set you up in business for
 t niite a while

  i know said anna contemplating
   he check i wish i might-

  now the wine that abner brownell
had taken and the sense of his big win-
ning in the street and the extraordinary
lure of anna gages beauty combined
at this moment to make him very in-
cautious he got up suddenly and
leaned across the desk there in the circle
of light from the hanging lamp

  anna- he said huskily-anna if
theres anything i own that you want
you can have it youre the most beau-
tiful thing in new york city and ive
simply got to have you

  why mr brownell cried anna
startled and realizing but hazily the full
import of his words you mustnt say
such things you and i have been such
good friends    and mrs brownell
comes to see me youve been so gen-
erous so kind oh i didnt think you
were that sort of man

  that sort of man  that sort of man
good lord anna theres only one sort
of man and thats the man whos human
youre too beautiful for us all we
simply cant stand it wed be more
than angels i f we could and im no angel
he stretched out a hand and touched
her arm but she drew back the man
sprang around the table and caught her
crushing her in his arms

  i love you he said i cant help
it im mad about you

  before he could kiss her she managed
to wrench herself free she was both
frightened and angry

  dont be absurd she warned trying
to conquer her excitement anna ab-
horred dramatics not realizing that she
was herself the personification of drama
youd better go away i think youve
been drinking too much your success
downtown has gone to your head dont
do anything else that youll be sorry for
to-morrow

  sorrv you dont know me why
shoum i he sorry  come anna cut out
the theatricals 

  that will do said the woman very
coldly it isnt theatricals im only


the charlatan

learning the kind of man you are when
you call a decent objection tc being in-
sulted theatrical

  oh piffle returned the man with
foolish impatience youre no innocent
kid youre a woman youre not main-
taining an establishment like this one on
what the ravens brought elijah youve
done me several good turns and id
like-

  and to show your appreciation you
come here and humiliate me interrupted
anna you have formed a high esti-
mate of your friend mrs gage well
im going to be generous with you
youre not in your right mind youre
drunk - inexcusably and offensively
drunk go away now to-morrow youll
have remorse and i certainly hope you
have it as you deserve and dont come
back to me for advice because im never
going to help you again

  anna turned and went out of the room
hastily leaving brownell gaping into the
darkness he stood by the desk sway-
ing a little yes he guessed he must
be pretty full he picked up the opaline
globe and contemplated it solemnly
queer streaked-looking thing he re-
placed it

  guess ive made an ass of myself
he muttered thickly guess im a damn
fool ought to be shot he found
his hat and left the house shedding
maudlin tears of self-pity

  in her own room anna sat by the
window opened to admit the fresh cool
air which she badly needed for her face
was burning with shame and excite-
ment the miserable significance of this
incident spelled itself across her aching
brain

  it could not have happened if ahner
brownell had respected her the taint
of a questionable profession no matter
how adroitly practiced was inevitable
and coupled with that fact were her
extraordinary beauty and her inescapable
sex consciousness the man had re-
vealed to her not his own unsupported

estimate but an opinion that must be
fairly general

  she was then an object of question
of speculation among men like brownell
she was a beautiful faker about whom
things might be asked that were not asked
about women who led lives of perfect
convention hedged in with protections
and domesticities

  anna reviewed as dispassionately as
she could her career since coming to
new york at the start she had al-
most starved she had never charged
a fee for her advice but people had been v
generous with gifts she had managed
this very adroitly and as she had worked
her way toilsomely upward her caution
had increased for years she had de-
clined these gifts except in one class of
cases

  men of wealth came to her constantly
seeking from the occult that which their
own sagacity sometimes failed to supply
anna was able to give them advice of
immense value-at least they thought
so when they believed their successes
to be due to her help they rewarded her
these rewards she felt they could well
afford to give five hundred a thou-
sand two or three thousand dollars-
such sums were forthcoming from these
clients and upon this revenue alone she
lived

  it was a precarious way of subsisting
still it sufficed it would have been
ample if annas living had been on a
more economical scale but she loved
beautiful things luxitries servants she
delighted in the association of people who
moved in the more exclusive circles she
entertained at her home many who pro-
fessed friendship for her she sparkled
in conversation made a charming dinner
companion attracted clever persons who
appreciated her brilliancy

  that there were times when as at
present her bills were overdue did not
greatly worry her something would
soon happen to chamre this condition
she always had faith in the future
henry payson dowst



 things would come out right because
 they always had done so

   but now in a flash she comprehended
 the dangers by which she was beset at
 the very best she was a charlatan only
 a portion of her revelations were truly
 psychic more often than not she de-
 pended on her ability to draw lightniug
 conclusions to read the thoughts of her
 clients through a chance word the dila-
 tion of an eye the shadow of a corrugated
 brow her intuitions were amazing

   she wondered with shame if she had
 not unduly emphasized her personality
 in her dealings with men would they
 have been as liberal if she had been ugly
 had she fooled them more than she in-
 tended and had this been possible be-
 cause her beauty cast a spell over
 them 

   something in the palm of her clenched
 hand forced itself to the surface of her
 consciousness-a crumpled bit of paper
 brownells chcck it was enough for
 her to live on for two or three years
 with her bills paid and the rest banked

  she could be secure comfortable com-
 placent then there was stanley sup-
 pose he should want a little capital foi
 some business venture it was foi
 stanley she had struggled all these years
 for him she had made herself a mounte-
 bank and a polite humbug sacrificing her
 elf-respect fifty thousand dollars

   with trembling but determined fingers
 she tore the check into tin flakes then
 ihe went and scrubbed her hands with
 iot water and soap

   i dont know she thought how im

 	pay the grocer but it wont be with
   ibner brownells money i

vi

 	if youre not able to make up your
 v ind said abner brownell why dont
 u take a little advice

   t dont get you rejoined strickland
   yhat sort of advice ive employed

the best lawyers interviewed the most
expensive men i could find

  brownell laughed

  i dont wonder you fail to grasp my
meaning he said the big speculator
and strickland the western railroad
man had come to be rather good friends
first meeting at the club later in offices
in and about wall street they found
they had many acquaintances in common
sliared many interests brownell ad-
mired the vigorous two-fisted type rep-
resented by strickland and tht latter ap-
preciated brownells nerve his sports-
manship and the keen intuitions that
had made him a successful operator in
big fields

  youll think im crazy went on the
speculator but i want you to take whax
 say rather seriously you wont be
sorry youve reached a place where you
dont aiow just whom to trust you
can get backing from either of two
crowds of bankers for youi new exten-
sions question is which crowd will
give you the best deal and is one or the
other of them likely to slip something
over on you isnt that the way you
feel

  exactly brownell ive exhausted al
the usual channels for obtaining informa-
tion i cant pin a thing on either group
yet im not absolutely convinctd that i
oughtnt to go back west and raise my
capital locally if these wall street
buccaneers once get their hooks into a
property its next to impossible to shake
them loose

  yet you know the money is here
and if you can make the right deal youll
get your capital quicker and cheapet in
new york than anywhere else in the
country

  true but im not sure i can make
the right deal

  then you should see mrs gage

 who the devil is mrs gage and why
should i sfe her  has she got forty or
fifty million-

 nonsense shes poor shes a


the charlatan

friend of mine-or was im afraid im
rather in her bad books just now anna
gage is the most remarkable woman in
new york and the cleverest go and
see her

  but brownell what does a woman
know about railroads 

  nothing but you go and see her
here give her this

  brownell scribbled a hasty note thrust
it into an envelope

  i wont seal this he said but if
its all the same to you id as soon you
didnt read it just go up to fifty-fifth
street and see mrs gage if she doesnt
help you ill buy you the finest rolls
royce you can get in the city

  anna gage late the same afternoon
sat in her study reading or seeming to
read by the light that shone above her
great carved desk a big leather-bound
book in reality the words printed on
the faded yellow page were quite mean-
ingless to her for she was contemplating
her own soul

  once she reached out and took the
opal globe in her hands seeking to plumb
its mysterious milky depths for some
symbol of her future but she saw noth-
ing but those cryptic whorls of iridescent
liquid smoke that seemed never at rest
wreathing and coiling within the sphere
as pale inner fires glow beneath the sur-
face of a great pearl so sighing she
put the baffling thing from her

  miss brooks brought her a note and
when she recognized the handwriting of
the superscription she was tempted to
drop it unopened into her wastebasket
but curiosity for the time held its own
against her sense of outraged decency
besides the envelope was unsealed

  as she read the contents frankly apolo-
getic she suddenly gave a little gasp

  it cant be she breathed no it
isnt possible pondering she sat a
moment in deep thought then very 
well miss brooks she said

  the secretarys back was no sooner
turned than anna gage pulled open a

drawer of her desk and took from it a
white veil silken but sufficiently con-
cealing which she threw hastily over head
and face it was a device she seldom
used holding it to be but a part of that
charlatanry which she had learned to
despise

  thus it was that joe strickland found
her in that sombre chamber a swathed
figure of mystery instantly his matter-
of-fact mind was touched with suspicion
to bimself he said

  what kind of flummery has that chap 
steered me up against  a swell fortune-
teller looks like hope it hasnt some
blackmailing scheme behind it

  the figure at the desk indicated a big
chair and he sank into it with a gingerly
sheepish air

  you wanted to see me asked the
lady i am mrs gage

   well i dont exactly know that i did
brownell said i ought to maybe you
can tell me why he thought so i havent
an idea

  the same joe thought anna view-
ing the heavy features the clumsily
powerful shoulders the large shapeliness
of brow and temple the same blunt
old joe strickland

  aloud she said mr brownell has
written me a note simply saying that he
is sending you here he does not tell
me anything about your errand

  he said i ought to ask your advice
said strickland

i see may i look at your palm
the man extended a huge hand with
about as much enthusiasm as a child who
seeks to determine the dangers of a live
caterpillar

  oh p he said yroure a palmist
no this is not a profession with
me i sometimes give advice to my
friends or the friends of my friends
i am doing this as a favor to mr brown-
ell-to whom t owe no favors

  he said he didnt guess he stood very
strong with von said strickland he
hoped the woman would talk some more
henry payson dowst



there was a quality in her voice that
pleased him strangely it was to him like
some long forgotten time of his boy-
hood coming to life in his conscious-
ness she was apparently studying his
hand through the folds of her veil
too bad he blurted when j-ou let
a ladv read your palm if you arent al-
lowed to see her face

  for the present i dont wish you to
see me too plainly said anna it might
interfere with the psychic vibrations
could it be that strickland sensed a
note of mirth in that voice

  well he demanded what you find-
ing out about me

  many things you have been suc-
cessful you have to do with iron stone
things that are hard and swift and power-
ful machinery of some kind-no there
are shining bands of steel two of them
lying- parallel-rails 

  you mean yon see those tilings in my
hand

  no im not looking at your palm
my eyes are closed and im dreaming
-dreaming of a little mill town a thou-
sand miles away and a small house on a
humble sort of street a house with a nar-
row piazza and vines

  what-what are you talking about
the mans voice was low and tense

  	about you and-a girl-a girl with
black hair and dark eyes and an odd
foreign-sounding name - pol pol -
polen-polenta-polenka f

  my god

  you loved her didnt you and she
treated you badly

  loved her i worshiped her i did
then and i do now ive never let
it die ive never seen a girl or woman
since that id cross the street for im
that way-stick to things once my minds
made up go on whats the rest of it 
i was going to ask you about what i
should do to raise money for my rail-
road but-

  i was coming to that said anna
she picked up jjer opaline globe

  strickland leaned forward

  no no she said dont you look
close your eyes-dose them tight

  she stripped off her veil and plunged
her eager gaze into the swirl of weaving
fluid and there she saw many things
-queer shapes faces odd characters as
mystic as the hieroglyphs oi rameses
but they were as dear as the words in
a childs primer

  not for a long time had such revela-
tions come to anna polenka she had
even imagined herself to be losing that
psychic insight for which she had of late
so often substituted the ordinary shrewd
logic of a sagacious mind those visions
seen by her consultants conjured up by
their own emotions spurred by a little
of annas hypnotic will power-they
were as nothing to this she breathed
quickly her heart beating faster and
faster

  dont look she said dont open
your eyes listen i may forget much
of this you arc in an atmosphere of
had influences you are in danger of
great losses you musnt trust any of
the people who want to associate with
you here in new york you are in
need of an enormous sum of money
but if you secure it here you will pay
too dearly go back where you came
from-back into the west where people
know and understand and sympathize
with your ambitions there are many
many more things that i could tell you
but i-id rather not-to-day perhaps
i can never tell you but please be
guided by what i hve said

  she looked up now her eyes dazed
like those of one who issues from dark-
ness into a strong light

  what was i saying rm she asked
vaguely did i tell you what you
wished-

  anna cried the man anna po-
lenka r

  she had forgotten to replace her veil

  joe she said softly toe strick-
land isnt it i knew it must be now


the charlatan

you understand how i knew about the
house and the    girl   

  anna said strickland what are you
doing here playing this faker game-
dont joe she cried pitifully
please dont thats the one thing you
could say to hurt me most-because its
true

  brownell said you were the most re-
markable woman in new york and the
cleverest

  but not the most honest did he yet
-what did i tell you about your rail-
road was it money you wanted i
dont remember just what i saw in the
globe-i seldom do

  joe looked incredulous

  you said to go back home and get
my money there i think its good ad-
vke whether its what you call psychic
or not im going to follow it ive al-
ways felt suspicious of those chaps ive
been dickering with then after a
pause say anna what ever became
of steve rivers

  dead ten years ago

  whos this gage

  there isnt any never was i took
the name because i wouldnt use rivers
anv more i brought up my boy-
your boy

  hes twenty now hes an engineer
hes made good joe even at his age
and hes all ive got and all ive worked
for and all  have to look forward to
hes going to china in a few days joe
i guess you dont know what that
means

  niver had anna polenkas usually
discreet lips been open as they were at
this moment never her tongue so loos-
ened all the hardships the struggles
the heartaches and humiliations of those
twenty years came surging forth and
she recounted many of them to the lis-
tening man

  well he said all tve got to say is
youve had a darned tough time f al-
ways told you that steve was a bad lot
though see what a pile of trouble youd

have saved yourself if youd married poor
joe strickland

  thats not kind joe

  i suppose not well you know what
i said a few minutes ago ive always
loved you-love you to-day as much as
ever youve fought your battle and
won it it isnt for me to quarrel with
the weapons you use i guess they were
the ones god gave rou and youd have
been a fool not to use them now will
you go back west with me

  i know you anna you like the easy
things of life you wanted em when
you were only a kid i dont blame you
-didnt then i could have given them
to you after a little but you didnt think
so all right youve tried your way
try mine ill guarantee it to work
he stopped and looked into the great
dark eyes with a hopeful confidence

  lets understand each other said
anna polenka dont think me cold-
blooded joe im fond of you and al-
ways was i did make a mistake when
i gave you up for steve but in spite
of the problems ive had to solve in
spite of my love of luxury and the things
money will buy in spite of the fact that
ive been what you call a humbug-at
least partially-and what some others
might call something of an adventuress
im a good woman people can say what
they know to be true of me-im some-
thing of a mystery even to my best
friends and perhaps to myself as well-
but they cant say im not good joe

  so when you say you want me to
go back west with you jut what do you
mean dont think ive hardened joe
dear i havent but oh joe strick-
land ive had to protect myself so
long-

  strickland got ponderously to his feet
and picked anna up bodily setting her
on her own big carved desk

 for goodness sake anna he
growled is that the kind of man you
think t am well ill tell you right now
you donlt have to protect yourself from
henry pay son dowst



me because if youre a good woman
im a good man and im proud of it
he gathered her into his anus and
kissed her with considerable violence

  ive been waiting twenty years for
this he said you cant blame me if
i seem a trifle enthusiastic eh

vii

   in spite of the precautions with which
anna surrounded herself in order to
guard against intrusion there was hardly
a day on which some stranger did not
ring her bell

  these usually came armed with a card
or note of introduction from one of her
previous consultants all of whom she
had implored to be discreet and as her
manifestations of psychic talent were
not generally thought to be her means of
livelihood her acquaintances were in-
clined to respect her right of privacy
nevertheless anna was inevitably some-
thing of an institution and she was never
surprised when people wholly unknown
to her sought admission to her house

  mr edgerly raydon was one of these
he presented a note from that mrs
oxnard whose domestic infelicities had
led her to seek mrs gages assistance
this was within a day or two after the
appearance of joe strickland

  during this time anna had been liv-
ing in a cloudland of happiness she
had won no more for her the subtle
deceits of a profession she had prac-
ticed under cover of subterfuge and social
fiction she had come through lire puri-
fied she had brought up her boy and
made of him a useful competent citizen
one of whom she could he proud and
now she was considerably less than forty
beautiful charming in the very prime of
her life with everything good to look
forward to

   so her heart filled with song she had
notified the discreet and taciturn miss
brooks that her services would not be

  required after another fortnight she
had begun to make arrangements for
leaving her house if she and joe wanted
to spend a winter in new york they
could go to a hotel anna informed the
agent that she would like to find some-
one to take the lease off her hands

  it was now definitely decided that
stanley would sail for china within a
fortnight there was infinite comfort
now in the thought that she would be
with joe and other scenes building a
new and she hoped permanent circle of
acquaintances

  such thoughts as these drifted cheer-
fully through annas pretty head until
the hour when mr edgerly raydon
crossed her threshold at first she
thought of sending him away but she
disliked to disappoint mrs oxnard if
he were a friend of that much-alimonied
lady

  instead of having the man shown into
her study however she greeted him in
the reception room she hoped she
might persuade him not to insist upon
a seance

  raydon was a dapper individual clad
fashionably in morning coat with the
correct braided edges furbished forth
with a gardenia and armed with a flexible
walking stick of pale bamboo

  from behind spectacles of heavy tor-
toise shell peered out a pair of shifty
eyes his hair not loo abundant and
well whitened was parted in the middle
from brow to collar and brought straight
forward over his cars his nose sharp
and predatory overhung a mustache and
beard carefully trimmed to a scrupulous
square and like his hair parted in the
middle

  advancing as anna entered the room
he extended a ceremonious hand and
murmured

mrs gage charmed tm sure
instantly anna felt herself go cold all
over if she had been a cat her fur
would have stood up and crackled with
galvanic sparks very distantly she re-


the charlatan

turned mr ray dons greeting and sank
into a chair her black eyes were fixed
on her callers face with a kind of un-
canny fascination

  it seems to me he went on that
we have met before i think you will
not have forgotten

  i dont-remember- why- panic
took possession of anna polenka
steve she cried hoarsely steve
i thought you were-

  dead eh well im not im not
a bit dead im very much alive
but-

  but why am i alive what right
have i to be alive well i was in that
railroad accident and i was reported
killed thats all when i found i was
supposed to be dead  changed my name
it was a very nice way out considering
the trouble id had with the bank and
the bulls stopped hunting for me that
was the best part of it

  what-what are you-

  what am i going to do is that
what you want to know anna ive
come here to discuss it with you its
largely up to you a fellow ought to
talk these things over with his wife dont
you think i believe in harmony in the
family perfect agreement and all that
but you cant-im not-

  oh yes i can and you are you
bet you are youre just as much my
wife as you ever were so im thinking
of coming and taking up my residence
with you you have plenty im rather
low in funds just now i often am then
again i often have it to burn depends
on circumstances  should say that you
and i might work together very nicely
so that wed both have money all the
time

   hy-i dont understand-you

  it was curious this halting ineffectual
method of expressing or attempting to
express herself steves reappearance
was a tremendous shock it was crush-
ing stupefying she could hardly sense
it that rosy pink-cloudy dream of the

  last day or two- little fool how
could she expect to get off scot-frec
after years of deluding people it was
preposterous

  people are very confidential with
you went on steve they tell you
tilings you can tell em to me when
two people know a thing it may remain
a secret but of course its ftiuch more
fragile so to speak or lets say its
more escapable if you get what i mean

 suppose that quite a lot of people would
go to considerable expense to be assured
that their secrets didnt escape its quite
an art to make them see it and all that
but-

  steve rivers screamed anna you

from men-i think i could give him the
names of several-to live  what
reason would anyone suppose could pos-
sibly lead wealthy men to give a young
and fascinating woman presents of five
hundred a thousand three thousand dol-
lars

  oh my god wailed anna cover-
ing her face with her hands and groan-
ing under the lash dont steve for
the love of heaven dont

  oh went on steve coolly that isnt
all of course all your fine friends would
be greatly interested to know that youre
the bunk it would make a splendid
sunday feature-wealthy siren fools
society with phoney psychics that
has sort of a catchy jingle eh and
what would our little son think of it

  rivers paused to contemplate the ef-
fect of his words

  it would be very easy to put people
wise he said ive managed to keep
in touch with your activities for a couple
of years now that cook you fired three
weeks ago was a clever girl i got her
from one of the slickest private detective
agencies in town then there have been
others-the cook was onily one its
cost me something but i guess it will
be worth it

  you can be proud to announce that
youre marrying edgerly raydon im
rather well known about this town and
no ones got anything on me either ive
kept em all guessing for a good many
years theres been many a day ive
worn a darn stylish overcoat over my
undershirt and a false dicky collar but
i got away with it im something like
you only not so clever im a good
bridge player and ive been pretty lucky
with the horses but im a useful chap
too ive found out a lot of things about
a good many people and that sort of
information is always worth money if
you know where to locate your market
thats why you and i ought to-

  please please begged anna i
cant stand it its too horrible

  well said her visitor you take
twenty-four hours to think it over ill
drop in again to-morrow its really
the only thing to do you know i dare
say we should get on like old boots once
we became reacquainted with each other
weve such a lot in common it seems
to me goo-by see you again

  anna polenka rivers stood by her
great carved desk and contemplated the
cryptic globe

  youre a cruel cruel thing she said
aloud youve always given up freely
for others but youve never told me
anything why didnt you warn me
why didnt i know this was going to
happen 

  she thought of joe strickland felt
again his kisses on her lips kisses she
had generously returned

 and i was another mans wife
lord pity me i told him id marry
him and i cant all these years ive
clung to respectability ad these years
ive trained my boy to reverence what is
right and good and now unless i take
that beast back and live with him and
help him with his blackmailing schemes
i become an unworthy mother whom
hell hate hate hatef why shouldnt
he hate me ive done nothing but
deceive and cheat him all his life hed
better have known exactly who he was
from the first and just what sort of
woman his mother was it wouldnt be
so hard for him

  again she gazed into the milky depths
monster she cried what harm
have t erer done a soul that i should be
treated like this

  it would be but a short time before
steve rivers would return for his an-
swer anna had her decision to make

  all i can do she reasoned is to
take him back tt will break joes heart
but i cant help it the mans my hus-
band i cant have joe ill have to
take steve and do the best i can may-
be i can keep him from disgracing  s
maybe i can make something of him


the charlatan

thats my only salvation its a ter-
rible thing to have to face i could give
him up to the authorities for the bank
robbery but what good would it do
all the miserable business would come
out id only briiig the house down
around my own ears

  she slumped down in her chair
dropped her head into the crook of her
arms and wept bitterly at length she
sat up wiped her eyes and looked about
her

  if i can keep him from disgracing
us she repeated over and over for
stanleys sake i must-i must

  suddenly she arose and seizing the
globe held it high above her head at
one side of the room was a fireplace
half hidden in the gloom and this was
equipped with a pair of huge wrought-
iron tire dogs

  anna polenka began to swing the
globe up and down up and down each
time swaying further back

  im through with you she said
you never helped me any ive seen
men weep at the things you showed them 
tve heard women thank god for you
ive seen you give the worlds best gifts
to even-one-all but anna polenka now
im through

  she hurled the heavy globe across the
room with a jingling crash it struck
one of the great andirons and fell in a
thousand scintillant fragments on the
floor-fragments that lay and glinted out
of the darkness at anna polenka with
the effect ot a thousand sinister feline
eyes with a shriek she turned and
fled the room

ix

  in the reception room anna ran into
joe strickland

  why honey he inquired whats
all the excitement t thought id drop
in and see if youd found someone who
would sublease the house you know

weve got to be starting west pretty
soon

  joe joe im not going i cant

oh never mind it doesnt matter joe
our romance is over

  but anna girl-

  steves come back

  anna nodded sadly

  where is he  ill find him and wring
his skinny worthless neck then i guess
he wont stand in our way

  oh joe you know you cant do a
thing like that theres no way out of
it hes coming here to live and i cant
help myself

  he is not coming here to live
roared joe he may be coming here
to die but not to live not if i get my
hands on him

  anna smiled sadly at the big mans
vehemence

  theres a messenger boy coming up
the steps said joe

  go and let him in-thats a dear
joe secured the message and returned
to the reception room

  you know its no use trying to make
me think youre going to stand for that
dog he sputtered there are a thou-
sand ways we can put a spoke in his
wheel why ill hire seventeen differ-
ent lawyers to-

  joe that wouldnt help hed do all
his harm while you were making your
plans

  anna was fumbling at the envelope
joe had taken from the messenger when
she read the enclosure the man saw the
color leave her face

  oh she said in a little gasping sob
oh  read it joe dear

  strickland took the message ami
read

dear anna 

  ive got cold feet i dont want to come
back to you after all i thought  was put-
ting over something clever hut since talking
with you ive changcd my mind you and
 together would be sure to make a mess of
diings because you hate me the plan i had
in view would never work out

 then ive discovered youre poor 
thought you were well fixed but i was told
last night that you cant pay your butcher
i have to have money or im unhappy so
do you we should both be miserable all
the time it we tried to live together

  im going to play my fatal beauty against
omc widow lady with coin and a loving
disposition steve rivers is dead and you
and edgerby raydon havent any interest in
each other

  in the last twenty years ive been asso-
ciated with all sorts of people and some of
em have standards most of them are sports
and ive doped it out that persecuting a woman
youve already harmed as ive harmed you
isnt exactly a sporting proposition also i
remember now that i loved you once and
i cant get out of my head the way those
big black eyes of yours looked yesterday
when you were crying i can kick a dog or
steal a babys candy but theres a limit even
to my talent for plain and fancy cruelty

  let me suggest that you go back home and
quietly apply for a divorce from that man
rivers on the ground that he deserted you
twenty year ago and may not be dead

  so help me god anna ill never bother
nor threaten you again i know you wont
put much faith in that promise just yet but
youll find its a pertecdy good reliable hole-
proof promise guaranteed for a lifetime

  i wish you the best of luck and hope youll
wish me the same

penitently

                      edgerly rayoox

 do-do you believe him joe asked
anna dont you think heru come back
to annoy us later  can he possibly mean
to let me alone

 most likely but if he ever pets
messy again ill deal with him mean-

while we ll have that divorce tiling fixed
up right away honey

  but stanley mustnt know-

  if a woman named rivers in a dis-
tant state divorces the husband who
deserted her hows stanley ever going
to know its you besides hell be in
china

  some day said anna when he
gets a little older and wiser pm going
to tell him the truth and so long as i
live im never never going to delude
another human being not even myself
and i guess that for twenty years ive
fooled myself worse than  have any-
one else

  nonsense said joe your con-
science should be clear think what a
wonderful mother youve been to that
boy and think what a wonderful wife
youre going to be to me

  he gathered her suddenly into his
arms and sat holding lier as if she were
a child for a moment she lay there
weeping a little then she sprang away

  you musnt joe she said im a
married woman wait until i get my
divorce then well be married a soon
as you like

  the man looked a trifle crestfallen
gracious you arc a straightlaced
little thing think of the twenty years
ive waited so much love ive missed
-and its all charged against you
well said anna polenka relenting
the merest fraction if its as bad as
that maybe i ought to make just the
tiniest payment on account

   absolutely said joe strickland and
made the collection on the spot

consider the moving staircase

                     by cleveland moffett

 if you observe the men and women
 on a moving staircase you will see
 that some stand still and let the ap-
 paratus carry them comfortably to the
 top while others stride up the steps even
 while they are in motion thus gaining
 a few seconds-but wasting precious
 strength i have seen a red-faced man
 carrying a heavy bag or a tired mother
 with a baby restlessly wearily pushing
 on up to save those few unimportant
 seconds why 

    for no particular reason except that
  this is the american way and it is
  a foolish way we devise an admirable
  mechanism for relieving the over-bur-
  dened human machine then we refuse to
  use it a moving staircase is an elo-
  quent sermon on our national unwilling-
  ness to rest

   we know that our human machines
 are driven by nervous energy stored up
 somehow in the brain probably by a
 chemical action while we sleep and rest
 but we do not dwell enough upon the
 fact that a brain depleted of its nervous
  energy is as ineffectual as a storage bat-
 tery depleted of its electricity this is
 literally true we can do nothing we
 are nothing without a rested and replen-
 ished brain health happiness love
 work patriotism every form of physical
 mental and spiritual achievement de-
 pends upon a rested and replenished brain

   therefore men and women have no
 higher duty especially after forty-five
 when the life forces begin to wane than

i	to see that they get sufficient rest in
many cases rest is more important than
i exercise we often exercise too much
but we seldom rest too much

   -

  i am a golf enthusiast i play golf
on sundays and enjoy it but i am be-
ginning to think that from a purely phys-
ical point of view it may be a mistake
god probably knew his business when
he gave us one day in seven in which
to rest

  what do doctors prescribe in the pres-
ence of almost every ailment a rest
cure a few days in bed breakfast
in bed i all day sunday in bed a
complete change and rest they order
the change because they know there is
more chance that a patient will really rest
if he is away from his ordinary worries
and excitements it is the rest that
cures with a few exceptions any dis-
ease that can be cured at all can be cured
by rest together with the right attitude
of mind

  but we americans will not rest we
must be always under pressure always
forcing ourselves up some moving stair-
case we telephone needlessly we
write letters needlessly we make ap-
pointments needlessly an unoccupied
evening is a tragedy a lonely day in the
country a disaster quick call up
so-and-so get out the automobile
golf  bridge poker set the vic-
trola going dance the fox-trot when
does the next train leave for town

  no wonder we break down shockingly
as compared with more restful people
in middle life and die ten or fifteen years
before our time american cities abound
in tired discouraged ineffectual men
and women full of pains and apprehen-
sions who might be restored to serenity
and usefulness if they would learn to
rest




sympathy

  rest  how 

  in the first place americans must
learn to sit still we waste untold mil-
lions in vital power in simply crossing
and uncrossing our legs in wriggling our
bodies in drumming with our fingers in
darting hither and thither sit still
suppose the barber does keep you wait-
ing five minutes what if the train is
half an hour late dont rush frantic-
ally for a newspaper and read the same
old dispatches for the fourth time sit
still and rest relax let the nervous
energy reservoir of your brain fill up a
little that five minutes or half an hour
of respite from strain is a blessing not
an exasperation it may be worth hun-
dreds of dollars to you it may save you
from heart failure or apoplexy

  in the second place americans must
learn not only to sleep enough at night
eight or nine hours but to sleep at odd
times to take little naps during the day
there are tales probably not true of
great men who have managed to get

along with four or five hours sleep a day

  napoleon

  well who wants to imitate napoleon
he was tat and died of cancer twenty
years before his time

  edison

  as a matter of fact edison replenishes
his brain by frequent naps some of them
long naps he has mastered the precious
art of sleeping at any time in any place

  the greatest woman in the world
sarah bernhardt told ine that for years
she has cultivated this habit of taking
naps during the day five or ten minutes
as opportunity offered often during
arduous rehearsals she would lie down
on a rug for a snatch of sleep saying
as she did so

  go right on with the scene wake
me in fifteen minutes

  and so despite the loss of one leg
she is actively in the game to-day tour-
ing the world at seventy-four still hold-
ing thousands enthralled by her art
because she has learned to rest

 rosemary had sent for him

 that was the one predominant
 fact in a world of predominant
 facts rosemary wanted-him f

   he sat staring at the bit of paper a
 scrawl from the attending physician

    mrs magnan will hardly last the night she
 keeps asking for you i think you had better
 com e-p ameil

 and there was an address to him it
 had something of the appearance of a
 message written in a foreign tongue yet
 inexplicably legible it jerked away the
 veil that he had carefully hung between
 present and past and showed the crouch-
 ing nakedness of those sick wounded
 years he had put a curtain thickly be-
 tween them and him and left them there
 to decay of their own spiritual gangrene
 but now-rosemary helpless and dying
 had taken away the screen of her own ac-
 cord she wanted to see him

   on the hearth a little fire whispered to
 itself the room was very still this
 quiet shabby room where he had spent
 so many lonely hours-it symbolized the
 failure of his own life and it had wit-
 nessed the slow atrophy of his soul of all
 that gave a man vitality and the courage
 to face his morrows it had not babbled
 as a friend might have done but some-
 t times in the shadows he seemed to see

	lurking ghosts of his own youth hear
 echoing laughter gay badinage even a
 t sharp whispered question from the man

 -	that was   

   should he go after all it would be
 a kindly thing to do possibly she would
  nave come to him had he been dying and

asked for her he was not quite sure of
that though he was never quite sure
of anything any more

  but he would go oh yes one did
not refuse the requests of the dying as
he rose searching lor his hat and cane
the mockery of the situation struck him
and he laughed out that quick shrill
mirth in the silent room had the crude
sound of merrymaking over a grave
he hushed shocked and ashamed

  when he opened his door he perceive i
in some haunting subconscious fashion
that the night was beautiful wonderfully
clear and crisp and pure what an eve-
ning it was swinburne leaped to the
lips and one thought of the garden of epi-
curus processions of houris in valhalla
a rudder set for the heart of the sunset
pale pink orchids red wine in a crystal
goblet    vet he was going to see
rosemary who was done with it all
laughter and love and sun and stars
and the cold lilies and warm red roses
that she had adored  it hardly
seemed possible she was life itself
resurgent effervescent deathless   
rosemary done with the things of earth 
he could not believe it suddenly the
thought came to him that he did not want
to see her like that

  but the old habit of considering rose-
marys wishes paramount reasserted it-
self and he walked quickly onward for
a year he had not known where she lived
he could have asked but any news of
her always brought a sick deadly sink-
ing of the heart tliat left him weak and
upset though without trying he had
heard a great deal




dregs

  but he had lived on somehow continu-
ally conscious of his hurt like a man with
a limb removed xo matter how hard he
fought the feeling he knew that she had
gone too deeply into his life ever to be
pulled up and cast aside

  the streets were full of hurrying peo-
ple each intent on his own affairs as if
there were no deathbeds in the world
was there any other by chance going to
say good-by to a rosemary who had for-
gotten him long ago and remembered
only when the light grew dim

  he reached the house of the doctors
address and hesitated a moment before
it it was a big house gray and quiet
massive stone balustrades guarded the
balconies and two bronze lions crouched
at the steps he did not think it was the
sort of house a woman like rosemary
would choose it was too solid and un-
omamental

  but when he had rung the bell and
had been admitted bv a shadowy servant
who seemed to vanish from the fore-
ground without effort he understood
the house was the cocoon -shell of a
gorgeous butterfly what a wonderful
vision it presented crowded with beau-
tiful things from many lands and cen-
turies  long vistas showed him antique
rugs old flemish paintings perfumed
incense burners heavy cordovan leather
hangings covering the walls hand-carved
seats evidently from old monasteries and
cloisters huge lanterns of antique italian
verd swung by brass chains from the
frescoed ceilings

  yes rosemary had loved beauty and
mystery and wealth here were the
tangible evidences of them he stood
and waited awkwardly fumbling with
his hat beside a table inlaid with onyx
intaglio his feet on a kermansliah
stretched along the polished wood he
had never been in possession of more
than one thousand dollars at any time in
his life the grim thought struck him here
in the midst of luxury any one of these
beautiful things represented a fortune

  the soft-footed servant came back to
say the doctor requested that the gentle-
man be brought upstairs to the sick room
unostentatiously lie relieved the gentle-
man of his hat and led the way up the
stairs between massive dark balustrades
every step showed magnan further ex-
clusive largeness of detail well what-
ever may have been rosemarys inner
life certainly she had made a fine setting
for herself he reflected and then he
was standing on the threshold of such a
bedroom as he had never even dreamed-
of looking across at the woman in the
lace-draped bed the doctor sat beside
her a rigid nurse in white stood opposite
him a rosy light seemed diffused from
no tangible source but it was shaded
from the patients eyes

  that figure on the bed filled his vision
became abruptly the one tiling in the
lovely scented place rosemary   

  the doctor beckoned him without a
word then nodded to the nurse she
withdrew quietly magnan went breath-
lessly over to the bed looked down

  shell not recognize you-now been
unconscious for an hour or so i doubt
if she rallies but i thought perhaps
youd want to come the doctor hesi-
tated a little he understood and even
his hardened perception felt the trem-
bling tragedy of the gaunt shabby man
before him

  the face on the pillows was beautiful

a heavy lustrous mass of dark hair
swept away from a forehead creamy and
clear-cut as a pearl the long black lashes
showed startlingly against the colorless
cheek outlined as cleanly as the curved 
narrow brows rosemarys features
were ideally perfect like some old cameo
carved by a master who loved greece
nobody who loved her ever forgot rose-
marys mouth-that warm delicious j
mouth with its wonderful curves its j
little trick of smiling one-sidedly oh
rosemary    rosemary

  he was down on his knees now by the
bed and doctor parnell rose
elizabeth burgess hughes



   weve done about all we can jie said
gravely ill leave you here if you
want nxr you can call this number the
nurse will be in the house and i wont be
far away ill be back in the morning

 magnan nodded he was scarcely
conscious of the doctors presence but
lie gathered that the were leaving him
alone with rosemary he was to watch
the night with her

  presently he heard the door close and
he stumbled to his feet and got into the
chair the doctor had vacated rosemary
lay like one dead except for her rapid
breathing and pounding pulse one might
have believed her dead he sat and
looked at her and went over many
things in his mind how beautiful she
was dying there in her rosy canopied
bed howlike her the room wras in its
expensive fastidious beauty the sheen
of silver on her dressing-table seemed to
blend an insistent note with the fragile
loveliness of it all-gleaming striking
yet in harmony with the rest

  he recalled the little two-roomed flat
where they had begun housekeeping it
was cheap and tawdry and uncomfort-
able but to him it had seemed a paradise
rosemary was only seventeen then she
was the eldest of eleven children they
were very poor and she had never known
anything but crowded poverty but she
had hated it with that blind revolt that
often exists with almost  standards of
comparison he knew now that she had
married him only as a first step away
from the teeming disorder of her home

  soon the little flat bored her she want-
ed to get away from it magnan was
young willing and hard-working but he
wasnt what is known as a manager
he couldnt make money

  but there were a great many other men
who could and rosemary was the sort
of woman who properly dressed could
set a whole restaurant or theatre to gap-
ing and questioning it w-as a long time
though before she was properly dressed
she had a passion for clothes but a

grocers clerk at eighteen dollars a wreek
always fearful of losing his job could
scarcely gratify this passion he plunged
himself head over ears into debt one win-
ter to buy her a french hat she craved
that was the winter she met carpenter

  there is a striking similarity in the
autobiographies of the rosemarys of this
world carpenter was twenty-two a rich
mans son with nothing to occupy him
but having a good time he made a vo-
cation of that magnan never knew how
they happened to meet but was rose-
mary really so much to blame for finding
carpenters magnificent limousine and a
warm scented music-stirred cafe with
its excitement and rich food more to her
taste on a cold night than the bare little
flat heated only by a cooperative furnace
which was simply a joke she was like
an orchid dropped by mistake in a slum
alley-magnan realized that but what
could he do 

  he did a great deal as it happened
when gossip first brought the affair to his
notice he was sick and disheartened
and in a brutish mood he did all the
things he should not have done-if he
wished to hold rosemary he stormed
swore threatened insinuated unspeakable
things ordered her never to see carpen-
ter again his was the violence of the
meek once aroused it is to be feared
but rosemary her red lips sneering sat
in silence till he had finished then she
shrugged and turned her back upon him

  after that she was clever enough to
conceal her movements till a friend-one
of the kind who feels it his duty-told
magnan that she was meeting carpenter
regularly at a certain rather dubious tea-
house crazed with jealousy magnan
went to the place found them together-
and shot carpenter dead

  the jury acquitted him for the un-
written law backed him with irrefutable
evidence but it had mattered little to
him which way the verdict went now
that rosemary was no longer his owing
to carpenters prominence the scandal


dregs

was blown far and wide he felt him-
self a marked man

  looking back he knew now that rose-
mary had never loved him and that she
had loved theron carpenter after all
she wasnt much more than a child and
carpenter was the first attractive man
she had ever known there had been
times when he wanted to beg her for-
giveness    and there were other
times when he could have tom her limb
from limb and been glad   

  all this had been fifteen years ago
rosemary was thirty-three now and
more beautiful than she had been then
strange that in fifteen years one hadnt
forgotten that is a long time to remem-
ber-anything

  he bent closer to her looking into the
expressionless white face the accident
that was costing her life had occurred
when one of tomlinson waynes drunken
chauffeurs had pitched them over a preci-
pice wayne was a multimillionaire and
the greatest politician of his time skill-
ful brilliant unscrupulous more than
once magnan had heard it whispered that
rosemary was the power behind the
throne doubtless she was the power
behind many thrones her record since
his acquittal had been one long history
of outre triumphs

  rosemary had indeed come a long way
from the grocers clerk with his satur-
day night pay envelope the greatest
men of the day had been proud to be tied
to her chariot wheels she was another of
the du barrys pompadours with which
history is dotted-a woman of many lov-
ers but preserving inviolate her own in-
dividuality she had become cold ruth-
less powerful she his little soft rose-
mary the ignorant high-sehool girl he
had married had developed into a per-
son to be reckoned with lovely but hard
and determined clever enough to wrest
from life everything that she desired
strange that after such a career there
should be watching now at its end only
the grocers clerk to whom she had given

herself in the beginning  he puzzled
over this somewhat stupidly

  the night crept on once he saw
rosemary lift her hand then it fell back
lifelessly on the coverlet she had won-
derful hands small smooth exquisitely
molded so many middle-class women
have hands that betray them but had
rosemary been of the middle class in
station yes-she couldnt help that but
the soul of a catherine of russia had
been born in her he had not under-
stood her but since she had gone out of
his life he had read a great deal and
tried gropingly to grasp the meaning of
things she recalled to him now the
great deliberate agnostic mistresses of
kings who smiled down from a great
height on their lowly beginnings   
all personal feeling had died out of his
heart all rancors all old hates he only
remembered

  it must have been one or two oclock
in the morning when suddenly she
stirred moaned began softly to babble
to toss about on the bed at first he
could make out nothing she said then
with difficulty he caught the words
bob and home he was bob-and
presently he knew that rosemary was
whispering incoherently of their first
days together his heart leaped into his
throat-stood still she-this marvelous
sinner who had broken every rule yet
who somehow commanded peoples ad-
miration-was murmuring of the little
flat with the window in the air-shaft and
the crippled furnace

  so cold she muttered and he tried
to draw the gorgeous rose-wool puff
about her but he knew she was think-
ing of those dreary rooms

  forgive- she began once and he
comprehended the reason she had asked
him here she felt that she had wronged
him well she had but perhaps he had
wronged her too one cant keep an or-
chid with the treatment under which a
sunflower thrives

  the tears were running frankly down
elizabeth burgess hughes



  his face by now and suddenly he leaned
  over her and began to talk ail the pent-
  up tenderness for the woman who had
  betrayed him swept into his tremulous
  tones he told her that he had long ago
  forgiven her that she had never had any-
  thing really to fear from him that he
  had loved her and known all the time that
  he was not good enough for her

    her broken babbling ceased at his
  voice she lay inertly her eyes open
  he wondered if she could understand
  what he was telling her he went on
  talking quietly enough but in his tones
  throbbed everything he had ever felt for
  her    she seemed to be rallying re-
  viving her pulse had quieted somewhat
  her flesh felt cooler to the touch but
  he knew that it was only that astonishing
  flare of energy that often conies just be-
  fore the end

and then it happened she lifted her
body suddenly almost with a spring her
hair slipped down about her face and
she tossed it away with a quick shaky
movement her lacy gown showed the
fine white slope of her shoulders her
splendid throat her wonderfully molded
 arms thsft horrible turtle-turn of
 waynes machine- had crushed out her
life but it had taken little of her beauty
 her eyes stared about the room then
came to rest on him they were sane
i and clear she was conscious and she

i	recognized him

 and in that moment magnan knew the
truth he read those wide eyes as if

i	he had been a clairvoyant he saw

	gleaming there-hate hatred of the
i years that had followed carpenters
 death hatred of his weakness that could

-	not hold her in the little flat hatred of

ii	his jealousy which had taken-away all
r her chance of being a happy woman an
v ordinary woman hatred for his part in

iithis rich house and all that filled it

  that flash of recognition went instant-
ly she dropped back weakly to the
bed and lay huddled there eyes closed
when she opened them they were no
longer clear but clouded with the mist
of delirium

  for what seemed a century magnan
sat on in a stupid silence watching her
face the blow of that revelation had
left him temporarily without feeling he
heard a clock strike three then the half-
hour    lie buried his face in his
hands

  out of the silence rosemarys golden
tones came as electrifyingly vivid as
lightning he sucked in his breath
sharply at that abrupt cry his face wait
gray  she was holding out her hands
her face convulsed with repentant en-
treaty she was trying to beg something

  forgive    forgive

  he dropped down beside her trem-
bling the centuries seem to whirl past
him as he listened could he make her
see tliat he had long ago forgiven her

 forgive mt- thcron forgive-

  the dawn unhealthily yellow-an ugly
pale yellow like badly peroxided hair-
stole through the lace draperies the
doctor and the nurse entered the sick
room almost simultaneously

  the nurse rooked at the face on the
pillow touched the pulse turned to the
doctor in astonishment

  shes sleeping naturally shell he
conscious when she wakes i dont un-
derstand it doctor shes past the
crisis-shes better

  but doctor parnell was looking keenly
at the night watcher who sat stiffly si-
lent his head on his breast the doctor
bent down to him made a quick examina-
tion

  htn f muttered the doctor heart
failure

  magnan was dead
she loves me

by hale merriman

ghe loves me

    until last night i never guessed never dreamed that she cared

     she has always been so apparently indifferent so casual

     but last night i discovered that she has loved me all the time-that it was all
a mask-maidenly shyness she confessed it

    it came about in this way

    i was just reading over the evening papers when there came a timid rap upon
the door of my bachelor apartment kato my japanese servant being out i an-
swered the door myself

    she shrank back as if contemplating flight when she saw me-covered her face
with her hands

    alarmed as well as astonished i drew her into the room

    she melted into my arms clung to me passionately kissed me

    she spoke in broken sentences she could endure it no longer she loved me
so it was stronger than pride greater than maidenly reserve

    it was like a flame that scorched and seared and consumed her and would not
be satisfied would i be kind to her merciful

    she was lovely  i have always coveted her my fragmentary phrases
mingled with -her own our lips clung kisses turned to wine upon them

i would have asked her to marry me long ago but i am such a penniless beggar

    but she loves me for myself alone having compromised herself by appearing
unchaperoned at my apartments she suggested that we be married at once before
the midnight bells rang out over the city we had been made one forever

by jove the wonder of it that queenly creature loves me for myself alone

    how glad i am    otherwise-

    -she might be disappointed when she finds out that it was not her newly
acquired husband but a cousin of the same name who inherited the fortune mentioned
in the afternoon papers

 phe dusk is weaving at its loom
 of shadows purple-dyed

 the attar of the lilac bloom
 drifts down the twilight-tide

 illusive veils of vapor wreathe
 the meadows wide outspread

 while rhytlimically the young leaves breathe
 in slumber overhead

 drowsy with dreams the night birds croon
 and oer the hills afar
 rises the lovely dian moon

the dark pool

          by mary barratt

 she stood before the mirror with
 uplifted hand tucking in a strand
 of hair then dropped it to smooth
 an already creaseless gown the face
 looking back at her was very girlish
 suddenly she realized this drew closer
 as if surprised she was in fact very
 young hardly more than a girl but she
 had felt so much a woman she blushed
 even then halconsdousy she was
 aware that the blue of the dress setting
 off the ivory of her shoulders and neck
 and the pale pink of her cheeks was be-
 coming a teasing thought leaped into
 her mind unexpected unwelcome she
 ought to have felt this way the day she
 had stood before the glass at home wait-
 ing to go downstairs to the strains of the
 wedding march-and she had not felt so
 at all she had merely felt numb and
 unready and now in a tranquil twi-
 light three years from that other twilit
 hour when she had married monning and
 had come to spend her first summer here
 at the bluffs for the first time she fell as
 she should have felt then  it was an
 absurd fancy she tried to laugh it off
 but her own voice sounded unnatural
 all she could think of somehow was
 the casual low refrain of fresner say-
 ing do drop in and see the new water
 color to-morrow-and well have tea
 brewed over the fireplace and talk
 surely it was a simple invitation it
 might be even matter-of-fact and yet-
  the disks of pink in her cheeks widened

   downstairs in the large summer liv-
 ing-room she saw her husband his head
 bent over papers on the desk drawn into
  a corner through the window the low-
 b-l s

ering sun caught the streaks of gray in
his hair he looked so old just then be-
fore he glanced up the twelve years
difference in their ages seemed present
and potent looking at him she could-
nt help but recall the girlish vision her
dressing-table mirror had given back
how old he was and how young she
was

  he turned from his papers and smiled
placidly not without a gentle affection

  going for a stroll he remarked as
if to a child

  by this time she was toying absentlv
with some sprays of blazing-star in a
vase on the piano

  i guess so she returned languidly
readjusting the tall stems then with
a level glance at monning she added
frankly hendry fresner has a nvw
sketch  am going to drop in to see it
and take a cup of tea

thats good nice young chap fres-
ner he turned to his scattered sheets on
the desk dinners at eight i suppose
why did he always put a tact of rou-
tine as a fiestion

  yes i suppose so she murmured
and dissatisfied with her tone walked
over and dropped a hand lightly on the
gray-streaked head the sun will he
going down then well dine on the
piazza and watch it

  he seemed almost embarrassed   
what a funny fellow 

  good he approved and was en-
grossed once more in the papers

  she went out-across the veranda over
the terraced lawn down to the bluff
which overhung thq misty river the




the dark pool

pungent aroma of pines filled her nos-
trils there was a bite to the air she
breathed it in deeply and her head went
up she walked briskly thinking of the
tea brewed over the fireplace she was
singularly eager 

  gradually her pace slackened why
was she eager why did she feel like
this she was not interested in fresners
new water color-not especially tea
had no particular charm for her these
were facts and she admitted them can-
didly she would rather walk trying
to analyze the thing she remembered his
words conventional in themselves yet
somehow heightened by-she didnt know
what-a tensity in his tone perhaps a
dull glow in his tanned face she saw
again the lighting of his gray eyes below
the high smooth forehead the straightly
brushed-back brown hair she shivered
slightly walking there on the bluff over
the river possibly it was the air-she
should have worn a wrap the fall of
the water over the dam made a gurgling
music in her ears rather chilling yes
she would prefer to walk    she
would walk rapidly returning to dinner
the better for the exercise fresner
could hardly expect her

  she halted abruptly there directly
before her was his cabin built of logs
and perched almost perpendicularly
above the river in her sell-absorption
she had not reckoned on the path she
was taking she should have turned into
another now she could almost reach
out and touch the old bronze knocker on
the door

  fascinated she gazed at that door at
the play of firelight through the spiares
of vtiajowpane she took a step back-
ward hesitated had she said she would
come but then certainly she could
change her mind she would return
home at once    she started precipi-
tately the dry branches crackled under
her feet

  then the door swung open and fres-
ner s voice was calling out cheerily

  i say youve lost the track havent
you mrs monning

  she stopped looking furtively over her
shoulder at the slender but stalwart
young form now advancing the short
sjrace between them

  no no-hurriedly t was jut-
walking

  oh the tone dropped from eager-
ness to disappointment  heard you
and hojed you wete coming in

  it seemed the natural action for her
to put out her hand he held it briefly
and an odd consciousness ot the touch
went through her t hoped he was
adding that you were really going to
keep your promise

  did i promise

  the water color he amplified has-
tily

  yes- was coming wasnt i she
avoided his eyes

  and now

  variable woman she tried -
laugh

  he did not join her

  tin sorrv and the kettle was over
the log his voice seemed faintk
husky

  she hesitated the twilight was still
broad dinner would not lie served for
more than an hour generally a dull
lour for her unless    besides he j
had said she would drop in and to escape
now would be awkward    she
yielded they were going back together
his hand lightly on her ami

  she said something pleasant and now
laughed quite freely he joined her in
a subdued tone   

  the logs burned merrily the fireiiht
raced cozily along the walls and ceiling
meeting and mingling with the sunset
glow it made mutahle frescoes of fight 
and shade the pictures candlesticks 
bric-a-brac took on a hazy warm in- 
definiteness the kettle sang

  he drew up a low reclining chair fcr
her and she relaxed stretching cu
her tiny feet toward the warmth letting

them touch the andirons it was homy
and comfortable the fresh glow from
walking in the crisp outside air
showed in her cheeks ilcr eyes were
bright she was like a healthy girl en-
joying the creature comforts of the neat
cabin fresner dropped onto a furred
skin at her feet she chattered and he
listened and while she talked gayly
on all the time she was thinking to her-
self 

  what a little fool i am he is just
a youngster himself hardly older than
i and it is perfectly natural that i
should be glad to drop in and cheer him
up isnt he young and-yes hand-
some i might be a twin sister its
just youngness that makes us happy to-
gether i have been getting too old i
have been entertaining ridiculous fancies
there was never anything simpler and
more harmless and innocent in the
world

  after awhile a silence settled on them
then breaking it she exclaimed

  but how stupid of me the water

color

  yes to be sure-the water color

  the light was now poor for which he
apologized she went up to the picture
and he put a finger on her arm to guide
her to a better view she could sense
the touch and his nearness rather than
feel it tangibly she withdrew for a more
distant scrutiny

  it is beautiful she murmured
sincerely it is the arrow bend just
as we saw it that evening of the picnic
when the sun was setting and the moon
rising at the same time

  yes he replied a little awkwardly
it was that which i tried to reproduce
i hoped-i am glad you recognize it

  he swung about and began the prepara-
tions for tea she moved curiously about
the room looking at him now and then
how stalwart how lithe how free he
was

  she thought she heard something out-
side-a branch slapping the window

doubtless-but a momentary alarm went
over her why she was annoyed at
her pointless nervousness and glad of his
summons to the small table he had pulled
up with the cups white upon it

  she had again settled luxuriously into
the easy chair he filled a cup and held
it out to her she lifted her hand to
take the cup and for a second their fin-
gers touched his appeared to tremble
slightly then suddenly the cup tot-
tered he made a fruitless effort to bal-
ance it and she jumped to her feet
laughing as the frail china was shivered
on the hearth

  in rising involuntarily she had thrust
out her arms fresner had reached out
to steady her they met in an uncalcu-
lated embrace fleeting flitting simul-
taneously both stepped back flushing
scarlet but the area before the fireplace
was restricted and they were still close
to each other fresners lips were a
straight tense line his eyes held hers
then-he had impulsively caught her
hand in his was leaning toward her gaz-
ing into her eyes breathing hard her
own breath was inexplicably rapid a
little clock on the mantel chimed

  marcia he cried hoarsely his hands
a vise about hers its no use ive tried
hard ive fought against this moment
but all the time i think i knew it had
to come oh i kiteiv it marcia dearest
because-because i love you 

  she felt lax terrified immovable a
new panic beating at her temples

  hendry you mustnt-say that she
heard herself pleading vaguely

  if i have-hurt you- he struggled
with the words

  you havent hurt me she whispered
but we dont know what-

  slowly strong irresistibly he was
drawing her to him she felt his breath
warm upon her face his cheek for a
dizzy moment against her cheek and
then very slowly tenderly his lips upon
her lips lingeringly meltingly    while
the room whirled before her closed eyes


the dark pool

everything seemed unreal and far far
away

  a log crackled in the grate- she start-
ed back wildly

  wh-what arc we doing

  it was only the tire dearest

  he extended his arms to her again
was about to encircle with them the ivory
softness of her shoulders with hands
uplifted she pushed him from her at
irst gently then feverishly fiercely

  no no dont i her pulses were
heating a tattoo at wrists and temples

j ier eyes were large and bright and hard
i le saw and shrank awav

  forgive me he faltered hoarsely
heaven knows i tried heaven knows
how ive fought marcia

  there is nothing to forgive she said
slowly i came here i k-t you do this
i-practically invited it oh yes i did
i ought to have known better hendry
fresner i did it myself bur i dont
know why i dont know why she
was crying- bitterly like a schoolgirl
no she resumed after a brief pause
during which she had gained control of
herself once more it isnt a matter of
forgiving but-how i hate you

  he said nothing his head drooped
she moved deliberately across the room
reached the door he was still standing
with downcast face a wave of innate
honest a candor not to be denied
swept over her

  i do not-hate-you she murmured
softly and fled into the deepening twi-
light

  the young man stood transfixed
where she had left him looking down
dolly at the shattered teacup

  for a time marcia went on blindly
heedless of direction stinging emotions
battled in her confused painful gradu-
ally however with the walking and the
sharp air confusion ebbed and her
fraught began to come more coherently
like a portentous pageant   

  she was had she was vile she had
married mooning when she was nine-

teen without really loving him that
was had she didnt know now exactly
why she had married him he was good
tender he loved her their life had
seemed happy all the time-all her
brief young life indeed-she had been
good and strong and honest and now
to-night in one flirting maddened ir-
revocable moment she had let fresner
itold her to him and had let his lips meet
hers had let the kiss sink into her soul
polluting it she had allowed it and for
a bashing second she had not cared she
had been conscious only of a dim and
dizzy unreality she had not meant that
this should happen it was simply the
degrading pulse of young life-but it had
happened another instant and she
would have snatched herself back never
to let anything like that happen again
but it was too late she had sunk in
that one minute to the depths in her
very very young heart she felt the
weight of sin heavy and saw herself
soiled tor always

  now she knew with a vast hopeless-
ness that it was herself whom she hated
could she ever look at her husband
again possibly she didnt know but
she did know that never never again
could she stand the scorching reproach
that her own mirror would send back to
her

  she had reached the edge of the bluff
she stared down at the deep purple
waters of the river swirling below the
dam at the deep tranquil pool beyond
the swirl it was so quiet    there
was a path nearby and w ith swift reso-
lution she followed it halt stumbling
hungrily to the waters edge

  the sun had set darkness was al- j
ready in the valley the plush curtain of 
early night a breeze sweeping a film 
of mist before it ran cold along the bank j
she shivered the fir trees moaned 
chill also the pool below her so very 
near seemed warm and still by contrast
she looked steadily fascinatedly into the
placid expanse of the river and at the
mary barratt



same time into the black and troubled
pool of her own soul a quiver ran
through her body in its incongruous blue
dinner gown she stared fixedly at the
river before her and her spirit grew
calmer as her strange courage rose how
quiet how peaceful how obliterating that
velvet mass of the river very slowly
she moved nearer the edge   

  a voice above hallooing-steps-the
swinging light of a lantern for a mo-
ment she had the odious vision of fres-
ner searching for her even here but
no it was her husbands call

  she had paused too long he was
upon her

  oh there you are my dear such a
scare i was afraid you had gotten lost
or slipped or something dinners wait-
ing you know really i dont think its
exactly safe to come here after sun-
down

  how could she look at him why had
she never felt the possessing strength of
him before why had she not thought
of him-then  what-what wild and
frenzied thing what selfish bewitchment
had entangled her

  you are all right dear he asked
tearfully when she did not speak

  yes yes quite all right she heard
a voice which must be her voice saying
evenly

  they went up the path together his
arm about her strengthening she was

walking as one newly awakened from an
exhausting dream

  at the top of the path a mans form
marcia drew closer to her husband
hello that you fresner

  yes i-i heard you calling and you
frightened me trom my frugal bachelor
supper the words came strained for
all their attempt at lightness

  i say you arc a lonely bachelor arent
you and bachelors when theyre
young are always hungry arent they
marcia why dont we ask fresner to
share our dinner with us

  im afraid i really-

  tut tut the older man cut in
when marcia insists you have to come
and you insist dont you marcia
yes said marcia faintly of course
then she added more firmly  youd
better come mr fresner because i
think well be gemg back to town soon
the days are getting cold

  why exclaimed monning he fall
is the best time of the year here my
dear

  oh youll both stay im sure fres-
ner put in its we young uns-bache-
lors monning-who fly away im leav-
ing myself this week

  they walked on in the darkness
marcia held close to monnings strong
arm down below she could hear the
river swirling over the dam it was
swirling and swirling

chanson de cabaret

by archibald sullivan

j-je watched her from the table white

    go flashing through the crimson light

       on little satined feet so slight

      he saw the dancers row on row

      pass through the maze they called the show
      and rainbows from the spot turned low

      at some brief signal or command

she came to him-held out her hand

they swept to meet the swimming band

      i am so very tired she said

      but faster still the music sped

      and globes v inked wildly over head

he thought he held some flying thing

  -	a girl upon a wild birds wing

      a circling ruby that could sing

      her slender bod flew around

      like thistle fluff on windy ground

     and pampas grasses all unbound

      i am so tired of whirl and rush

her feet grew still and oh the hush

      as she was lifted from the crush

     asked god oh you from sound of drum

      and noise that makes my stars stand numb

for what small pittance have you come

what ease from crashing glass by hours

      a paper world with tinsel flowers

      confetti playing rain in showers

then she who danced raised up her head

with stammering weariness and said

     dear god of heaven-just a bed

  as valentine kemp eased his car up
 to the horse block of the posr
home i slight graceful girl witli
auriferous streaks in her corn-colored
hair strode swiftly down the door-waik
pulling at her glove as she sank into
the seat beside kemp he saw that her
lashes were wet

  father any better shirley

  the doctor-thinks so she answered
brokenly but he-he looks so awful
and he cant mover

  the sioped at the kttle railroad sta-
tion when the train drew in a modish
young woman in lavender-gray from top
to toe with a black traveling-bag at her
side descended to the platform for an
instant her eyes flicked the group of by-
standers with that assured air which
comes with learning ones way about the
world then she spied the objects of
her search

  its so good to see you both again
-he exclaimed in a resonant musical
voice after embracing her sister shirley
and giving her gloved hand to valentine
kemp

  as the trio edged toward the automo-
bile aline post greeted several acquaint-
ances opposing their gravity with i
persistent cheerfulness that probably
provoked comment later this cheerful-
ness however soon vanished on the
short ride to the house along streets fa-
miliar to her from childhood a rebellious
expression clouded her handsome face
and narrowed the line of her scarlet lips
as rf she resented such a homecoming

but at the touch of her mothers arms
she slaked like lime

  poor little mother poor little
mother she crooned huskily then
after a moment did you telegraph for
randah too 

  xo i doubted if the poor boy had
the money tor his fare borne doctor
barrows says your father will live
though hell never walk again hes be 
asking for you for hours i believe ii
go right in you must be prepared 
great change she added with quiver mg
lips

  aline post knelt beside her paralyzed
fathers bed and covered one of his --old
nerveless hands with her own he lid
not speak or smile merely fixed his lus-
trous eyes upon her with tliai deta di-
luent that other-worldliness which
haunts the face of those who have stood
on the brink of the dark river and
strained their vision for a glimpse of the
misty farther shore but at last his lips
moved-tutilely at first

  dat iter it was a wavering j 
ing note you have come to help me-
in mv battle with the phantoms of
death r

  yes daddy and well win the
doctor savs so

  for half a minute lie seemed to w -igh
and sort her words laboriously pvn-
fuily

  yes ph live-a while not too long

i	hope-for your motliers sake and
yours the earth is for the living the
grave tor the dead there is no place

a night at jacqueminots

in the bosom of love she cried eagerly
with her transfigured face close to his

  forgive me he murmured snd
wearily closed his eyes

  when sure that he slept she slipped
noiselessly away

ii

  the two sisters undressed in alines
old room now shirley s with its sloping
ceiling and dormer windows shirley was
pretty enough hut side by side with
aline she was eclipsed by the others
dusky hebean beauty of a ripeness a
fullness an amplitude throughout which
registered her twenty-seven years and
as she moved about unpacking in her
sleeveless nightdress of rose pinkthe
younger sisters eyes glowed with pride
and devotion

  theres a rainbow rag for you peg-
gy remarked aline tossing over a pale
blue blouse of georgette crepe after
extricating herself from shirleys grate-
ful arms she continued these gloves
are for mother-gray instead of black
we are not going to let her make up for
a grandmothers part yet i bought
these things a week ago on the strength
of landing that soloists position in the
summerfield methodist church

  is it a swell church asked shirley
not a bit its downtown in a grimy
boarding-house district its rich ive
heard but the rich members live miles
away and dont come often they run
it as a kind of mission

  you probably see enough of swells
in those millionaires homes you sing in
observed shirley enviously how do
they treat you allie i riean what is

	heir social attitude

  entirely lacking answered aline
humorously they rank me somewhere
between the doorman and the butler
like fun but tell me something
about it where do you stand for in-
stance when you sing

  in an alcove-behind palms or box-
trees-on a landing-a mezzanine floor
-any old place that is sufficiently out of
the way

  whats a mezzanine floor

  aline answered this and forty other
questions as she continued her unpack-
ing

  i wish i could go to the city instead
of learning to teach school sighed shir-
ley curling up in a morris chair any-
way i dont see how im going to stay
at normal any longer-now her deli-
cately penciled brows suddenly arched
in a spasm of pain at thought of the
stricken father below

  well manage somehow said the
other rather soberly and little sis-
ter id sooner see you scrubbing floors
in carthage than holding down a city
job-at your age youre altogether too
pretty

  im not half as pretty as you be-
sides whats that got to do with it

  never mind now crawl in and go
to sleep while i write a letter

  when shirley sank to her knees at the
bedside and bowed her burnished head
her sisters hands suddenly became still
how often she herself had knelt in that
same spot on that same old fluff rug
was it only two and a half years before
or was it in some previous state of ex-
istence which her soul had long since
sloughed off

  sitting at the little desk which had
been her fathers high school commence-
ment gift to her she reread a letter from
her brother randall dwelling on the last
paragraph

   if yon can possibly let me have twenty dol-
lars sis send it at oner f know you still
think im sporty but believe me  have
learned my lesson and i need this money bad
but dont send a draft i should have to cash
it at our bank which is the only one in town
and i dont want them to know im getting
money from home its none of their business

  aline sat for some time with her hand
over her eyes as if in deep thought her
heavy black plait caressing her snowy
eimore elliott peake



shoulder then she wrote a setter and
in i enclosed two ten-dollar hills

  she snapped oe the light and crept
quietly into bed but shirley proved to
be still awake

  txnt you say your prayers any more
air she asked in softest accusation
aline was silent a guilty instant

  i seem to have been praying all day
peggy

  you mean tor father

 for him-and randall you and
mother--all of us including valentine
kemp

  oh ive been thinking ever since
i got his telegram list night how good
he has always been to our family
presently shirleys hand stole over to
cr sisters neck

  that isnt all either allie said she
momentously yal loves you he as
good as told me so one friday after-
noon when he was bringing me home
from sheldon in his car

  you mustnt believe everything a man
tells yon little osie admonished aline

       n old bachelor who would shy
a matrimony like a wild horse of the
plains at a bridle 

  old f sniffed shirley he must be
all of thirty-five

m

  the subject of this pillow talk
drorped in the next morning and an-
nounced that he was driving over tylers-
ville way to attend a sale of holstein
cattle

come along he entreated aline
the country is decked out with apple-
a bride

  shirley shot her sister a knowing

        route lay along the river roa
        the migrating prothonotary war-
        hot between the willows like
        od a shower that had fallen in
        -till gexr-ned the earths snccn-

lent robes of green as the car spun
effortlessly along a blessed relaxation
such as she had not experienced for
months stole over aline it was as if
the igor of the car were being trans-
fused to her veins

  or maybe she reflected it was the
vigor of the man driving he car pov-
erty had never prodded him as it had her
the comfortable world in which he hverf
was his by inheritance yet he was no
drones master was in his mood  and
she smiled betwixt admiration and some-
thing deeper to see him perch oa a fence
after reaching the tenney stock-farm
light a cigar and  uy a thousand dollars
worth of cattle before timtder men had
selected a single animal the act exem-
plified his pet axiom that to know what
you want is the nrst long- step toward
getting it

  on the way back they stopped at hay-
meadow creek to gather marsh mari-
golds

  sweet old place murmured aline
as they sat down in the shade to rest
a moment the smiday-stheo hac a
picnic here years ago t he beys rigged
a swing on a tree an d s-v ung pearl rivers
so high that she tell out and drsiocated
her shoolder it took an hour and a
half to get a doctor from town with
your sm-vace-wag-n you could do it ir-
how many minutes

  twenty-rive answered valentine
i recall the incident though i wasnt
present if i am not mistaken rt was
your brother randaii  en a kid of er
or so who gave peari her unfortunate
rise in the world by the way has e
struck his gait yerr

  i dont know yal she answered
softly he has a position that pai
him sixty a month he has been or
mind ever since he was expelled 
college i have always fancied that
something to do with fathers
stroke

t had a letter from him the
day continued kemp he wanted

a night at jacqueminots

borrow fifty dollars  didnt mention
it to your folks but i thought you ought
to know i let him have it

  you shouldnt have she exclaimed
with a flush you-you will probably
never get it back

  probably not still we dont know
he said he needed clothes ami  pre-
ferred to believe it it wont do to let
a youngster of his temperament get the
idea that he has no friends

  but yak she faltered i mailed him
twenty dollars only this morning in re-
sponse to an urgent appeal

  tin sorrv to hear that he plucked
a culm of grass and after a moment
added earnestly allie you have a stag-
gering load to bear

  yes she assented simply but i
suppose shoulders were made for loads
not a womans-for that kind of
load he protested  might as well
speak the rest thats in my mind allie
i once asked you to marry me i loved
you i thought you loved me but you
pleaded something about a career and
said no

  yes her voice was humble i
had my dream

  it wasnt your fault that it didnt
come true

  it was nobodys fault i suppose i
had a year of the best instruction before
father failed that was enough to have
put me on the bottom rung of the ladder
if i had had the voice

  you have a magnificent voice if im
a judge he declared

  she smiled at his valiant champion-
ship

  you are not a judge valentine i
have just a practical workaday voice-
good for the thing i am doing or for the
lyceum and chautauqua stage

  again he was silent a moment

  was i no judge either when i
thought you loved mer

  with drooping lashes and a faint suf-
fusion of her downy cheeks she fingered
a spray of the wax yellow blooms

  you were warmer then as we kid-
dies used to say in playing hide and
seek she laughed shyly and vouch-
safed him a peep into a pair of shining
violet eyes

  so if no career had stood in the
way- he let her divine the rest

  i should have settled down to making
pancakes for you of a morning oh

 might you can never tell what a
girl will do

  then why not do it now aline
ie asked lets cut this gordian knot 
and be happy together if we love each
other and want each other why not bend
circumstances to our end i know of
course that you cant abandon your
family i am simply asking to be al-
lowed as your husband to get under that
burden-if i may speak so without of-
fense you understand id make a
settlement upon you you would have
your private income to take the place of
your present earnings and it would be
the sweetest privilege of my life he
added pleadingly

  for a moment she fumbled the flowers
with tremulous fingers

  i believe you val but i couldnt--
oh i just couldnt she exclaimed with
emotion i have no false sentiment about
accepting money from you that would
be rating your money above your love
its my folks of whom iin thinking
dont you see my dear one the position
in which it would put them they can
eat my bread cheerfully but anothers
even yours might choke them

  they would teil you to marry me
he urged

  yes thats one reason why i cant
i must be as generous as quick for sacri-
fice as they

  as with the knights of old an obstacle
in kemps path usually but heightened
his spirit but here was one against
which his lance was of no avail for an
interval he gazed with moody eyes across
the shimmering marsh

  so it means does it that you and i
elmore elliott peake



must continue to tramp the road of life
with leagues between us

  she took his hand with a sad little
smile

  for a time at least maybe some day
at sunset we shall by chance or kind
fate pause at the same wayside inn and
thenceforth go on together

  is that a pledger

  yes

  and will you seal it

  she took his cheeks between her palms
and bending forward kissed him-as
solemnly as chastely as if the green-
wood were a cathedral and the tree under
which they sat an altar

  the reverend gordon hughes sat in
his study in the rear of summerfield
church a drizzle of rain misted the
windows over and the gloomy room
seemed a reflection of his soul it was
one of those moments when the sin and
woe of the little world to which he minis-
tered weighed too heavily upon him in
the past hour-an hour reserved for the
purpose-he had received three callers
all women and all seeking solace he
hoped no more would come but just
as a neighboring tower-clock tolled five
the usual signal for his release the bell
again whirred and he admitted aline
post

  though he had never seen her outside
the choir-railing gordon hughes had
more than once been acutely conscious
of his soloists rare beauty-and he was
under forty and still fancy free but
now confronted by her unexpectedly in
the wake of the plain faces of his recent
callers he was fairly startled by the
delicate colorng and texture of her olive
skin and the clean sharp chiseling of
her nose and mouth her free sure
stride the proud uplift of her shoulders
the gleam of a tapering arm tlirough
gmir these things were like the sudden

vision of a beautiful moth where only
bats were accustomed to flit

  i scarcely know why i am here doc-
tor hughes she began with visible agi-
tation you will doubtless think it
strange but i know that you set aside
this hour for people who are in trouble
i am in trouble i thought you might
help me

  i shall certainly do my best he as-
sured her just telling ones troubles is
often a help

  i cant tell you everything but-my
father is an invalid and i support the
family i have a wayward brother who
is also an expense to me i am not in
need of money she added quickly at
least not in any way that you could help
me i didnt come for that

  she paused crushing her meshed purse
in her hands as if summoning resolution

  since coming here two years and
more ago i have had my share of
struggle and heartache and i have sur-
vived them but recently something very
distressing happened-its a very person-
al matter-and i seem to have lost my
nerve this great city is crushing me
sometimes about six oclock when the
roar of traffic is the loudest and the
crowds are thickest it seems as godless
and as cruel to me as an arena of wild
beasts it frightens me

  the ministers line face was luminous
with sympathy

  perhaps you have overworked

  i have worked hard and i dont sleep
well she admitted

  life at one time or another presses
a good deal of bitter fruit to the lips of
most of us said he kindly i feel sure
though that with one of your courage
the crisis will soon pass but tell me a
little more of yourself if you will
my profession said she after a mo-
ment is singing at social functions in
well-to-do homes i have been successful
but in trying to analyze this evil that has
befallen me i have wondered if i havent
paid too big a price for success


a night at jacqueminots

  in just what way -if you dont mind

saying

  the use of men for one thing she
answered in a low voice

   the pastor discreetly dropped his eyes
and shifted a paperweight on his desk

   in tlese big homes she explained i
get no social recognition of course i
am simply a hireling like a cook but
if a woman has looks and a taste for
dress-and without them she cant suc-
ceed in my business-she often attracts
the attention of young men she receives
cards and flowers occasionally she is
clandestinely approached by these young
men in the homes of their mothers and
sisters she is offered entertainment-
motor rides dinners theatres-above all
a good word in quarters where it will
hdp her professionally you will under-
stand that to accept these attentions is
playing with fire

  i can easily believe it murmured
doctor hughes

  yet if a woman is strong-and skill-
ful-she comes to no harm in the con-
ventional sense i have used these men

i have been a good fellow as they call
it i have drunk wine with them-
smoked cigarettes-danced in restau-
rants it was that or nothing you under-
stand one is permitted to be good in
an elementary way but not prudish by
all this i profited financially in every
other way i have lost my self-respect
has suffered i am leading a double life
 am doing what i know appears evil to
others doubtless many people think me
-impure above all i am deceiving my
family if my mother or sister could see
me some night- her throat tilled

   hughes gazed at his fair suppliant with
supreme interest

   this is certainly very distressing he
exclaimed just how necessary are
these young men to your livelihood

  without them i should make less
money and i dont see how i could make
less and still keep afloat 

  society is a tree that bears its most

perfect fruit and its ugliest galls side by
side-at the top he murmured drum-
ming softly upon the table  suppose
it has been so ever since the first man
acquired two loinskins to his brothers
one frankly miss post you put me in
a quandary i could tell you that you
are a sinner hut  dont believe it of
cri dont approve of a womans
i	wine or smoking cigarettes but

tie  ie is this you are setting some-
thing that is very precious to you like
a girl who sells her hair is it justiti- 
able  the truth is-and we cant dodge
the fact even though we hate it-neces-
sity knows no law

  i thank you at least for not handing
me a stone and calling it bread said
she with a plaintive smile

  i wish  had the bread though he
exclaimed wistfully there is one you
know whom we can lean upon when we
are faint millions do lean upon iiim
daily my dear others i must admit-
and some of the most finely attunei-
find it difficult

  there is one other matter said she
after rising to go it your music com-
mittee knew what i have told you to-
day i presume my place in your choir
would be vacant

  i will assume the responsibility for
your staying he assured her mean-
while i shall not forget you i am going
to prav over this matter and perhaps
you will come to see me again

  perhaps said she accepting his
hand

  a bad quarter of an hour followed for
the pastor of summerseld doubts of the
wisdom of his course assailed him et
the next sunday when miss posts mel-
low throbbing contralto voice in gou-
nods green hill far away fell upon
the congregation like rain upon a parched
land he leaned back in bis tall pulpit
chair with dosed eyes and was thankful
elmore elliott peake



that he had not chilled her with the cold
admonitions of a formalist

  several weeks passed however with-
out her calling again and in spite of his
promise hughes allowed her to pass to
the back of his mind his new duties
as a vice commissioner made heavy
drafts upon his time and there came a
day when he was forced to abandon his
personal service hour in order to attend
a meeting of the committee on which he
served when he returned he found
miss posts card under his study door

  he thrust it into his pocket ate a hasty
dinner prepared a prayer meeting topic
conducted his service and then at a little
after nine set out for jacqueminots
which place the committee had arranged
that afternoon to inspect

  the temple which andre jacqueminot
once a pastry-cook of bordeaux had
erected for the worship of epicurus
nestled between the feet of two sky-
scrapers when the committee reached
it at nine-thirty its marble facade wet
from a passing shower glistened under
the flare of arcs closed motors halted
at short intervals before the mouth of the
tarpaulin tunnel which led from curb to
entrance silk hats fillets of aigrettes
white shoulders flashed past the side
opening left for pedestrians

  in the great main room-reputed to be
a reproduction of the salon of a vene-
tian palasso-waiters swiftly threaded
their way through a maze of crowded
tables a bluish haze of tobacco smoke
hung like an aureole about the massive
chandeliers the clack of tongues
laughter the clinic of china and silver
smote the ear in a ceaseless broadside of
sound that rose and fell in rude rhythm

  the cabaret stage was a solid perma-
nent structure with an imposing prosceni-
um arch of white and gold symbolical
of the elaborate performances that had
contributed to jacqueminots fame
hughes and his colleagues sat down at a
table reserved in advance which was
near the stage they had timed their

arrival for an act which was creating
something like a sensation-mademoi-
selle hyacinthe in her south sea idyl
-and in a few minutes this divertisse-
ment was heralded by the throb of tom-
toms with which the orchestra gradually
blended a weird barbaric air that irre-
sistibly quickened the pulse

  the curtain rose through a screen
of gauze which produced a curious il-
lusive effect the audience saw a back-
ground of palms a blue lagoon a cres-
cent strip of sand and shambling about
on the sand a pair of apes in the centre
sat the eve of this tropical eden her
long black hair draping her naked arms
and shoulders and her knees peeping
through a filmy mantle of green she
began to sing

for im the queen of the pawpaw islands
  where men are very very rare

  and leaves are all i need to wear

yet when leaves grow old and storms blow
    bold

  such clothes are an awful care-

  oh an awful awful care

  daylight faded the moon rose the
jungle awoke cockatoos screamed
monkeys howled but suddenly silence
fell the tapestry of vegetation patted
a womans face showed followed pres-
ently after cautious glances to right and
left by an arm a foot and then her
whole figure which glowed in the pallid
light like an ivory statue she stepped
to the waters edge  she flung herself in
with a splash and when the grimacing
apes appeared she drove them away
with shells

  the scene faded from the eyes of the
spectators when it appeared the queen
was again clothed in her pawpaw island
finery now a pandemonium in the
jangle announced the dreaded storm
which ere long burst with a shriek and a
roar the palms lent like strung bows
the queen crouched in terror her hair
fluttering like a banner and once more
she began to sing the dining-room
lights were extinguished for fifteen sec-
onds a spectral greenish glare flooded


a night at jacqueminots

the stage the storms profane hands
fell upon the queens umbrageous garb
singly by twos by threes the leaves flew
from her like frightened swallows
threatening her with nudity then at
last as she bowed her head and masked
her face with her hair darkness fell

  the lights in the dining-room flared
up for an instant there was a silence-
a silence punctuated by a smoldering eye
or a reddened cheek here and there
then came a crash of applause

  is this america or babylon asked
one of the commissioners turning to
hughes

  but the minister with his eyes still
fixed upon the stage seemed not to hear
no one in the illusive lighting aided
by the gauze screen could have recog-
nized the performers face but her
voice was the voice of the green hill
far away

vi

  three days later while hughes was
still turning the incredible things over in
his mind valentine kemp appeared in
his study

  i am trying to trace a young woman
named aline post he began at once
after introducing himself happening
in the city i called at her apartments
this morning only to learn from the
janitor that she had not occupied them
for several days none of her effects
have been removed last monday eve-
ning the last time the janitor saw her
she lett an order for a bottle of milk the
next morning i have come to you rather
than the police remembering that she
sang in your church

  hughes rather nervously shuffled the
sheets of his sermon he scented
tragedy

  you are a friend of miss posts
he asked sparring for time

  lifelong and of her familys if any-
thing has happened to her it vitally con-
cerns me

  nothing has happened that i know
of said hughes-which was not quite
true at least her disappearance is
news to me however i know of a
channel through which we may possibly
find her

  they took a taxi for jacqueminots
on the way each conscious of a charged
atmosphere and hughes loath to reveal
what had come to him almost as a con-
fession little was said but at sight of
the great arched entrance to the famous
restaurant kemp shot his companion an
inquiring glance

  miss post has been singing here ex-
plained hughes

  youre sure of that exclaimed
kemp incredulously i-i know this
place

  quite sure in the vestibule the
minister paused and added if youll
wait here ill look up the proprietor
why not both of us

  it is best for me to go alone i think
hughes manner was embarrassed
there are certain complications if
you will trust me  speak more frankly
when i return

  the salon in which nothing was served
before two oclock was dusky and stale
and without the glare of artificial light
a bit tawdry carpenters potinded on
the stage chairs were piled on tables
and half a dozen charwomen with mops
and buckets moved cheerlessly about
one of these speaking broken english
directed the minister to the offices on
the second floor

  andre jacqueminot though not every-
body knew it had long been dead his
present successors were hogg  otial-
loran and it was to hoggs sanctum that
hughes was led by an attendant

  the man looked his name he was a
huge dropsical caricature of his species
-purple-cheeked red-eared rheumy-
eyed with a bull neck swathed in triple
rolls of fat he sat as close to a desk as
his gargantuan paunch would permit
and at sight of his caller-whom he
elmore elliott peake



  seemed instinctively to recognize as an
  alien-he paused in his work spread iiis
  puffy hands over a plush waistcoat and
  waited breathing visibly and audibly

    lie did not trouble himself to return
  hughes salutation and at the ministers
  inquiry his eyes lit hostilely between
  their inflamed lids

     this aint a kindergarten he grunted
  astlunatically we dont keep tabs on
  our girls if young men want em they
  ketch em at the alley entrance

    may i ask if miss post played here
  last night

    whats it to ou demanded hogg
  cunningly

    never mind that answered hughes
  pricked to anger you will learn in due
  time if necessary

    the note of authority in his voice-
  seemed to rouse the proprietor to a sense
  of prudence

    no she didnt he answered

     and you wish me to understand that
i you dont know where she is now

    if you want to know so bad shes at
i the police station corner chestnut and
williams they nabbed her monday
night after the show

   hughes recoiled it was monday
 nights performance that he had wit-
  nessed

u and you have left her all this time-

   abandoned her-made no effort to bail
  her out he demanded indignantly
  hoggs face went a shade darker

     w hat the hell is it to you  he bleated

	 in an angry falsetto you bet we dont
i bail none of those bare-legs out they
t take their chances with the cops when
t they came to us now git out

    hughes with an angry red in his
 checks held his ground a moment then
t realizing the futility of further words
d he turned away

     mr kemp this is a painful duty he
  exclaimcd upon regaining the vestibule
  touching his handkerchief to his brow
   to be frank there are some things
  which miss post rather than i must ex-

plain to you i regret to tell you that
she was arrested here monday night
valentine went white

  arrested for what he faltered
presumably for appearing in an im-
moral cabaret act she is now at the
police station i can easily bail her out
as a member of the vice commission
which is one of my functions in the
case of-of girls whom there is yet a
hope of redeeming i may say for your
comfort mr kemp that my faith in
miss posts morality is just as strong as
yours and for that reason i will have
her case struck from the docket she
has suffered enough already-and will
suiter more when she learns that you
are here

  perhaps shed better not learn it
suggested valentine turning a pair of
sick eyes upon the passing traffic

  no-if you will excuse me perfect
candor is the better way-the only way
but to make it easier for both of you i
should suggest that you go to her apart-
ments and await her there i will not
accompany her but will prepare her
of course for your presence there

vii

  how long he waited in alines little
flat to which the janitor doubtfully ad-
mitted him valentine kemp never knew
over and over again his eyes made rhe
round of a bowl of withered violets a
statuette of venus with the apple a
cozy-comer with green tapestry hanging
lamp and tete-a-tetc through an open
door the brass rail of a bed with a pair
of white stockings hung over it and
still farther on the white tile of a bath-
room from the look upon his face
they might have been mementos of the
dead

  then the outer door suddenly opened
and aline steppedwithin she at once
placed her back to the door in the atti-
tude of an animal at bay and transfixed


a night at jacqueminots

him with hollow tragic eyes he leaped
forward

  aline he cried tell me that this
is all a nightmare

  i cant she answered in a dead
voice and with an ashen face its true
im a jail-bird last night i slept in a
cell with three fallen women

  but-but why he pleaded

  because like them i sold myself

  tell me the truth allie he com-
manded sharply dont tear my hurt
with allegory

  i tell the truth she answered with
the frigid calm of despair i sold my-
self to men-to be fondled by their eyes

  for a moment he gazed into her woeful
face

  you mean that you appeared in an-
an immoral performance

  yes

  this is preposterous you are not
yourself sit down take off your hat-
collect yourself-and tell me just what
happened

  she listlessly unpinned her broad-
brimmed flowered hat dropped it on the
table and sank into a chair he placed
for her

  now tell me why you did this-if
you did do it he prompted

  to save randall he stole two thou-
sand dollars-took a package of cur-
rency from the vault when the theft
was discovered he telegraphed me i
went to benton the officers of the bank
wanted to prosecute him i went down
on my knees to them-literally i told
thm it would tumble his paralyzed
father into the grave finally they re-
lented on the condition that i make good
the loss

  and not a word to me exclaimed
valentine reproachfully

  i intended to at first but it is not
easy to brand your brother as a thief-
or beg money from a man you have re-
fused to marry the shortage with
what rannie had left was only twelve
hundred dollars and the president of the

bank gave me six months in which to
pay it so i resolved to swing it my-
self

  she gazed out of the window with
mournful leaden eyes

   had written a song called the
queen of the pawpaw islands-inno-
cent enough in itself i offered it to
several vaudeville singers i could have
gotten two hundred dollars for it but
that wouldnt have gone far and one
night when i was at a theatre it oc-
curred to me to make a cabaret act of
it and produce it myself i wrote an
orchestra score designed costumes
sketched the scenery and went to jacque-
minots

  the managers after hearing my
voice agreed to give the thing a stage
trial with the orchestra when i was
through hogg-that unspeakable hogg
-laid his hot swollen hand on my shoul-
der and said fine girlie fine but
youll have to take off some clothes

  id blush to repeat his words but all
my blushes are gone i refused but
when he added take em off girlie and
well make it a hundred a week it
seemed as if i could see the threatening
maw of the penitentiary close leaving
rannie a free man i consented

  i went down to that place night after
night as my spirit in some loathsome
dream might go down to the pit of hell
there were twelve or fifteen girls in the
troupe and not a decent one in the lot
they smoked they drank they swore
they came and went in costly motor cars
they wore jewels their most coveted
honor was to be introduced to a new man
by one of the proprietors

  i had to run the gauntlet myself
notes and flowers poured in from gray-
beards as well as youths but i fought
them off and the only gleam of sunshine
that ever struck through the murk was the
hundred dollars i received every sunday
night which i always mailed the next
morning to benton six hundred dol-
lars t sent then the crash came
forsaken



  she shuddered and lifted her hand to
her throat as if to quell a nausea then

she cried out

  oh valentine dont despise me
with misty eyes he crossed over to her
chair and laid his hand upon her bowed
head

  despise you he murmured with a
twisted smile i honor you-i wor-
ship you

  after an interval he continued
allie i know you havent forgotten
that delectable inn you told me about
last may-that inn on the road of life
where you hoped we might meet some
day at sunset

  its sunset-for me she moaned
but i see no inn

  may not this be it in disguise-as
so many blessed havens are he asked
tenderly

  im so dusty and bedraggled that im
not fit to enter

  at any inn on the kings highway
all are welcome there is an attendant
to bathe and anoint the feet of the
weary and the lord of the inn has
fresh apparel for them

she gave a sob and clung to his hand
but i had expected to meet you joy-
ously with courage in my heart and a
staff in my hand-a meet companion for
the journey

  this is sunset remember said he
a night of rest and refreshment inter-
venes at sunrise all will be different
she lifted her dark eyes glistening
with tears and peered into his search-
ingly

  i had forgotten there would be a
sunrise sweetheart there wouldnt be
-if you hadnt come

 forsaken

by will thompson

rjen lakhs of gold has my loved one in his palace

    two golden thrones in his summer island palace
peacocks and boys and a caravan of dresses

three lotus-lakes which the morning sun caresses

sad is my heart sad and lonely in its palace

gone is my love from his summer island palace
past like the wind which its fickleness confesses
scattering the rose which the morning sun caresses

the joke

by manchester willdy

j have always prided myself upon being able lo laugh as heartily as anyone
when the joke is on me and i have never believed in doing things by halves
so when i found a notelying upon my wifes dressing table i read it

     it was a dulcet bit of foolishness reeking with love and sentiment and written
by my wife it was addressed to my own darling bill

    rapidly i named over the bills of our acquaintance seeking to name the
guilty one for of course i must hunt him out and kill him immediately also my
wife

    there were but three persons who coujff be suspected and after inquiring on
the phone learned that two of these were out of town so there was no further doubt
left in my mind as to who was the scoundrel

    not in the least nervous in the face of the terrible thing i was about to do i
searched out one of my hunting knives put a razor edge on it and then got into
my heaviest motoring coat for the note had directed bill to meet her at our
summer house across the lake

    even as i let myself into the cottage and heard rny wife coming to meet me
i ran a finger along my knifes edge and waited dispassionately

    as she ran to my arms i drove the blade into her soft flesh up to the hilt
stupidly she looked up at me

    why-bill she sobbed youve killed me

    then i saw the joke and began to laugh i had entirely forgotten you see
that my name is bill too

    i have always prided myself upon being able to laugh as heartily as anyone
even when the joke is on me


a sign of death

         by margaret e sangster

somewhere across a bleak pile of
boxes and crates a dog howled and
was answered by the whine of an-
other dog and then everything was
still again

  the contortionist spoke

  its taylors trained terriers he
said trying to keep the utterly foolish-
little quaver out of his voice its tay-
lors trained terriers

  the snake charmer moved nearer to
him and laid her strong muscular hand
on his arm the hand was trembling

  my mother used to say that when a
dog howled it was a sign of death she
told him well god knows i aint
afraid of death    an theres been
times when a new snake wanted t cut
up that its been pretty close in the
dim light of the flickering lantern she
regarded the hand that trembled re-
garded it with a detached sort of inter-
est god knows i aint afraid of
death she finished shakily but io
have it come sudden this way in th
night- the first dog howled again
and more insistently the snake
charmers fingers dug into the contor-
tionists arm

  why dont taylor shut that beast
up she questioned half plaintively
its fierce just now ter have t listen to
it

  the contortionist looked down at the
leg that stretched so curiously distorted
in front of him it had hurt most hor-
ribly when he had tried to move it and
so he had stopped trying moving it
had never hurt before moving his legs
and his strangely supple body was the

contortionists profession he won-
dered as a queer numbness crept up over
him why he had never before thought
of putting that curiously distorted pose
into his act it was so grotesque so
unbelievable

  didnt you know he answered al-
most casually taylor was smashed up
trying to get old jerry out in time old
jerry was the first dog he ever had
he stopped for the numbness was creep-
ing up-and up

  a little ballet dancer came walking
by almost stealthily she carried a pair
of pink silk tights under her arm and
two pink satin heelless slippers dangled
by their ribbons from one hand she
laughed foolishly shrilly as she saw the
contortionist and the snake charmer
sitting together in the light of the flicker-
ing lantern

  funny time fer a wreck what she
babbled never been in a wreck be-
fore everthing went smash but i
grabbed my tights an my slippers this
is my first job i told myself an i had
ter buy them tights an them slippers my-
self they say everybody goes after what
they love best-an i saved my tights an
slippers quite suddenly she pointed a
slim hand at the contortionist what
yer sittin so funny for she questioned
this aint show time

  the contortionist looked up at her
with wran eyes his lips were rather
blue

  i reckon he said slowly that its
broke-my leg y

  aint that funny half-screamed the
little ballet dancer aint that funny




a sign of death

you with a broken leg an theyve been
billin you all over th country as a bone-
less man aint that funny all at
once she crumpled down on the ground
a limp little figure with a blur of pink
clasped to her heart

  somewhere across the bleak pile of
crates and boxes the dogs began to howl
again the contortionists head drooped
forward but the snake charmer was
looking straight ahead at nothing

  oh god she said

  he knelt on one side of her and the
painted grin on his face was fixed and
staring and hard one full white sleeve
was torn away from his arm and blood
shone redly through the place where the
tear was the great black pompons on
his coat hung dejectedly he was the
clown

  she was the girl who ever since she
was a tiny child had worked on the very
highest trapeze she it was who every
night had done a marvelous leap for life
that began very near the white top of the
tent and ended in a slitnly strung net
very near the sawdust-covered ring and
now she lay silently she who had been
such a laughing proud little thing lay
with her head flung too far back and
her eyes widened reproachfully at the
sky

  he stood on the other side of her-
tall and pale his rather weak chin quiv-
ering he had caught her every night
when she came whirling toward him
through space her two small hands out-
flung it was typical of him that he
still looked rather carefully dressed that
the scratch on his chin had a strip of
court plaster laid across it he was her
partner together they had been known
as the flying follettes he had found
himself wondering half-unconsciously
who would take her place now that she-

  the clown was speaking

  why didnt you save her he was
asking hoarsely you was there i
wasnt  was in th wash-room tryin

out a new make-up in front of a hand

mirror when th crash came but you

damn you

  the carefully dressed youth looked
down at the limp figure of the other
flying follette

  i couldnt he muttered helplessly
i couldnt

  the clown raised his hopeless eyes

  like hell you couldnt he choked
i heard you jumped-

  the carefully dressed youth raised a
shaking hand to the strip of court plaster
 his chin

  she yelled t me he muttered t
jump howd i know there wasnt only
a little time howd i know that she
was goin ter fall three feet-and land
on her head manys th time shes
jumped a hundred an come up laughin-
like out o th net how was i ter
know 

  somewhere beyond them in the dark-
ness a gruil voice began tonelessly to
tell the story to one of the reporters who
had come up with the ambulance from
the city

  we didnt know what hit us the
voice kept complaining we was all
in our berths when it come yes- in
answer to a low inquiry they say it
was a collision  yes a good many
of us was killed    you seen th show
in the city last night-just four hours
ago

  there was another low inquiry and
then

  th girl that did th high trapeze
work rasped the voice it had lost
some of its tonelessness shes-gone
she landed on er head    that damn
partner of hers-suddenly and shrilly
the voice rose-he crowded in front of
er an jumped from th window she
let him if shed only jumped firt
but she was crazy about him

  across the body of the girl the clown
and the carefully dressed youth lool ed
steadily at each other even as they lit-
ened it was the youth who spoke first
margaret e sangster

  thats the knife thrower he mut-
tered lies new wit us he dont
understand

  the clown reached out a hand that
trembled under its vivid grease paint

  hes been here long enough t love
her too he snarled suddenly his
voice broke in a great strangling sob

  it aint fair he choked it aint
fair  it shouldve been you  he was
speaking to the carefully dressed youth
but his painted hand was touching very
gently a lock of the brown hair that fell
over the girls forehead-a lock of hair
that stirred like some live thing in the
night breeze

  yes the voice from the shadows
was toneless again yes if you want
me to ill take you around an introduce
you to some of th rest an then i must
go an hunt up m knives i was polish-
in em when th smash came an theyve
got scattered-some i gotta find em
theyre part of my job-those knives

i	couldnt throw straight i reckon with
any others the voice stopped abrupt-
ly and the listeners heard footsteps go-
ing off-halting bewildered footsteps

  it had come suddenly-the wreck
the circus train had been going smooth-
ly so smoothly that one could try out
make-ups in a wash-room and polish
knives in a crowded compartment some
of the performers were sleeping in their
berths and the animals in the rear cars
were very quiet one of the band was
drawing faintly pleasant music from an
old accordion    and then the crash
came

  there had been cries the calling of
names curses and more often the mur-
mur of a prayer there had been a
scrambling for loved possessions for ne-
cessities for the foolish little trifles that
people in a moment of emergency do
remember there had been screams of
pain-and of tear

  some of the cars had settled down
gently borne had turned over some
had crashed to the ground boxes heavy

boxes had whirled through the air to
fall in chaotic piles and they lay where
they had fallen it seemed as if it had
happened years ago-and yet only an
hour had passed

  the clown was staring at the girl on
the ground he seemed quite to have
forgotten the other man

  oh kiddie kiddie he whispered to
her couldnt you know-couldnt you
guess how i cared how i couldnt do
my back somersault when you was up in
th roof fer fear that youd fall an i
wouldnt be able to get t you quick
enough  couldnt you guess why i hung
around why i always was actin like i
wouldve blacked yer lil boots fer you
couldnt you guess-

  the youth on the other side of her in-
terrupted almost jealously

  she cared fer me he said and his
voice shook she didnt never even see
-you she was goin ter marry me   
my god she was gonna marry me

  all at once the clown was laughing
with a strangely hollow mirth

  thats why yer jumped first aint it
he asked with a strained sort of sar-
casm- cause she was gonna marry
you ydirty- id like ter have some-
thin in mv hands to kill yer with-thats
what id iike

  off somewhere behind a pile of crates
and boxes one of the trained terriers
howled with a long-drawn-out hopeless-
ness the carefully dressed youth shiv-
ered and touched the plaster on his chin
nervously

  its a sign of death-that he mut-
tered ter have a dog howl i always
knowed it its a sign of death

  the clown rose stiffly from his kneel-
ing position as he rose his foot struck
against something that might have been
a stone he kicked it savagely and it
shot into the air and fell to the ground
with a musical little clatter the clown
stooped half-dazedly to pick it up

  it was a dagger that he picked up a
long straight sharp dagger the sort


a sign of death

of blade that the knife thrower had
been wont to polish lovingly every night
between shows the sort of knife that
could be tossed straight and true to any
mark the flown took it in his hand
with a short hard idugh

   its one o his he said in a low voice
one o the ones he lost 

  across the body of the girl the youth
who had been one of the flying fol-
jcttes raised apprehensive eyes

  whered you get it he half gasped
what re goin ter do with it

  the clown rubbed a finger meditative-
ly across the sharp blade it cut through
the skin and he stared almost stupidly
at the bright red stain that crept out
through the grease-paint he did not
seem to hear the question

  the youth was backing away from
him away from the girl away into the
shadows

  what-what re you goin to do with
it he stammered again it was as if
he spoke against his will

  the clown looked up from his cut
finger-looked full into the handsome
weak face and then suddenly all of
the madness of a mad night leaped into
his eyes

  i said he remarked in a voice that
might almost have been a pleasantly con-
versational voice-i said that id like
ter have somethin in my hands so as i
could kill yer thats what i said an
now-now  got it with infinite care
he stepped over the still body of the girl

  he was a fantastic figure there in the
lantern-cut darkness a fantastic figure
with an unearthly grin painted redly
across a chalklike face and a white suit
trimmed with dangling black pompons
but to the youth there was nothing fan-
tastic about him there was only a pic-
ture of horror-stark horror-in the
clumsy garments and the glaring paint
the youth stood quite frozen with fear
unable to take his gaze from the ad-
vancing menace

  my god he almost screamed my

god you wouldnt why-she loved
me she wanted me ter go first an
anyway i didnt know my god
you wouldnt   

  wouldnt i though the clowns
face was very near the face of the other
wouldnt i-just with a sudden
lithe movement one of his hands shot
out fastened itself on a carefully tailored
collar

   im goin ter kill you he said softly
but-

  the carefully dressed youth was try-
ing to free himself from the firm hand-
the hand that was so terribly grotesque
in its grease-paint as he struggled he
talked in choking little gasps

  theyll hear you he jerked out
th snake charmers just aroun that
pile o crates sos th contortionist
theres others-near they wont let
you-

  they aint near enough said the
clown softly an theyll never know
what happened ter you this here wreck
has put so many good folks out that one
sneakin lil rat wont matter-much
he laughed and raised the knife

  suddenly from out of the darkness
there came the sound of small hands
clapping as still as some carven group
the two men stood-stood and waited
then

  whos there asked the clown brisk-
ly the knife was still raised high in
his hand

  one scarcely associates a child with a
circus except in the role of an onlooker
but the child who stepped out into the
flickering lantern light was a very real
part of this particular circus and he had
been forgotten quite since the time of
the wreck a little very blond kiddie
he was with wide eyes and a short quiv-
ering upper lip he was the wardrobe
womans tiny son and he was at once
the pet and the dear responsibility of the
troupe ouite unconcernedly he spoke
to the gown

  we givin a show here he ques-
margaret e sangster



tioned with a strange little air of hurt
y mightve woke me up i never seen
a show right out in th open like this
ithout a tent or anythin an you knew
it y might have woke me up

  the clown gulped once to steady his
voice before he answered then

  where ve y been billy he ques-
tioned very gently

  i was in th berth the child an-
swered i was asleep an then some-
pin jerked an i woke up an you was
all gone except mother she was on
th floor asleep an i couldnt wake her
up she must ve been tired ter sleep
on th floor an so i knew you was
givin a show out n th open an -
he reverted suddenly to his original small
complaint-you mightve woke me up
the clown spoke again

  y say yer mothers asleep billy
he questioned

  the child was staring wide-eyed at
the carefully dressed youth

  y look scared he remarked with a
quaint little air of knowledge but there
aint no reason ter be scared hes-
one chubby forefinger pointed to the
clown-hes done it all afore he uster
practice in front of me an she-he
nodded toward the girl on the ground-
she used to laugh what-he was
struck by a new idea-whats she sleep-
in out here for on th ground is she
awful tired too like mother

  the clowns hand loosened on the well
tailored collar that he was holding quite
suddenly and disconcertingly he was re-
membering a certain burlesque duel in
which he in his grease-paint and pom-
pons had downed a dapper opponent
he had rehearsed in front of little billy
for he had realized that if it made billy
laugh other little boys would laugh too
his business after all was the business
of merrymaking and buflfonery so that
little boys might chortleand cheer and
envy him    he had rehearsed in
front of little billy and she coming out
of the dressing-room had often paused

  to laugh with that soft throaty chuckle
ot hers that was like a dim little forest
brook where the water just barely
seemed to   

  the small boy was still speaking to the
carefully dressed youth his words
came hazily to the clown as from a
great distance

  youre fraid at th knife  slip
aint you he was questioning but
theres nothin ter worry bout it aint
even a real knife mos likely lies only
foolin   see hes a clown an clowns
never mean nothin youve been ith us
long enough ter know what a clown is
was there contempt in the little boys
voice 

  somehow perhaps half against his
will the clown released the well-tailored
collar in a nearly mechanical way he
dropped the knife into the pocket of his
baggy white trousers after all it zcas
only a make-believe knife-the little boy
had said so the clown found himself
wondering if the whole thing werent
some absurdly impossible dream-the
darkness of the night and the wreck
and the girl who lay at his feet he
raised a hand dazedly to his forehead
and felt something warm and damp upon
it he lowered his hand still dazedly
and saw that blood still dripped from a
cut finger

  i reckon-the little boys voice came
blithely through the stillness-i reckon
id better go n try and wake up my
mother now i reckon wed better wake
her-he pointed to the girl-wake her
up too itll be time fer her act and
motherll maybe have ter help her with
her dressin theres always-the little
boys tone was plaintive-another
show 

  all at once the clown was speaking in
a voice that was calm though a bit soul-
less he was speaking to the carefully
dressed youth

  take that kiddie away  he said an
dont take him back to his mother ill
go n look after her-in a while his


hawthorn abloom

  voice faltered and when lie finally spoke
again it was to the little boy youre
right billy kid he said youre right
im a clown an downs never mean
nothin

  like someone who was also moving
through a dream the carefully dressed
youth took the hand of the little boy
but the little boy kept right on talking

  in my story book he told them im-
partially there was a sleeping beauty
she slept all th time she did she was
a princess but i bet she wasnt any pret-
tier than sfur-his chubby free hand in-
dicated the girl who lay on the ground-
is there was a prince too know how
he woke vrup he kissed her my-

  and suddenly the gown was kneeling
again beside the still body his painted
face buried in the crook of his arm he
began to cry with gteat terrible wrench-
ing man-sobs

  the snake charmer looked wearily
ar the contortionist it occurred to her

  that he had been very stiii-and tor a
long while her firm hand slipped along
his arm until it touched his limp wri-t
and then quite sharply she spoke to the
little ballet dancer who was just strug-
gling up from the ground

  you better go n hunt fer a doctor
she said i heard that some ve got
here hes-she jerked her head to-
ward the contortionist-hes pretty
bad  you leave yer slippers an
tights here ill take care of em fer
you

  the little baliet dancer crept off like
a small obedient wraith and was lost
in the darkness the snake charmer
sighed

  from somewhere across a bleak pile of
boxes a dog howled and another dog
whined as if in answer the snake
charmers sigh turned to a half-shudder

  y-en th doctor comes she said
aloud  go n see if i can find anythin
that i kin give them dogs ter eat  
they must be hungry f

            by roger hartman

 when the eighth devil broke
 into laurence raeburns soul
 he entered without an invita-
 tion and the premises were very far in-
 deed from being swept and garnished to
 receive him there was no room for any
 devil at all in raeburn and least of all
 for the eighth who is worse than the
 other seven put together because when
 he dies he never dies alone but always
 kills something else

    raeburn knew a great deal about the
  eighth devil and detested him more than
  he hated all the rest he despised jeal-
  ousy in concrete and abstract more bit-
  terly than cowardice or cruelty or mean-
  ness or little whispering lies it stood
  at the top of the list of traits which rae-
  burn thanked his gods he did not possess
  he had seen it at close quarters and seen
  j it often and he hated it on thoroughly
  practical grounds

    his father had been wholly charming
except for the eighth devil that dwelt
deep in him waiting each chance to wipe
  out all the mans noble qualities and turn
i i him in a breath from a pleasant kindly
i gentleman into a raging hateful cad
tt raeburn had grown up in enforced con-
t  templation of the degenerative power of
i jealousy on human fibre and he had
 learned to loathe it as the son of a drunk-
ard comes to hate alcohol as his own
 character took shape before him as he
t came consciously to choose between
 good and evil as his formative processes
i unfolded he put down jealousy as the
i cardinal sin the most despicable vice

  raeburns mother had something to do
with that of course not that she dis-
cussed his father with him dissected the
older mans soul for the edification of his
son amy raeburn couldnt have stooped
to that disloyalty even for her boys sake
she was the rare type of woman in whom
pride and loyalty combine to produce the
sort of passionate self-respect that re-
fuses to take cognizance of weakness in
the object of its love amy raeburn
would have died on the rack before she
would have criticized anything kent rae-
burn did or left undone-even to her son
-most of all indeed to the son who was
raeburns as much as hers she taught
the boy by force of proud example in-
deed that whatever his father did was
right in her sight taught him that kind
-of pride which turns its back on the de-
fect of a loved one and its face steadily
outward toward a hostile world be-
tween mother and son there had never
been a whisper of comment on the father
that did not tend to strengthen the boys
admiration for the man

   yet in those silences those tacit avoid-
ances larry raeburn learned to envision
jealousy for what it was to detest it all
the more because it marred and stained
an idol to set his teeth grimly on the de-
termination that whatever depth of ig-
nominy might open before him his feet
should never descend into that particular
pit he never forgot the look he had
sometimes surprised in his mothers eyes
after one of those stormy interviews the
rumble of which tarried through closed
doors to his outraged ears-his fathers
voice raised and roughened and intoxi-




the eighth devil

rated with blind rage his mothers calm
dispassionate answers in the lulls of the
storm pie remembered too glimpses of
kent raeburns face after those periodic
debauches of emotion-the friendly
smiling eyes glazed and dilated the sun-
browned cheeks puffed and reddened the
sensitive lips distorted  it was like
drink like a gentleman whose cups have
wakened and brought to the surface the
brute and the cad larry raeburn had
reason to hate the thought of jealousy
to shun the first hint of its presence in
himself

  there had been one plain-spoken inter-
view on the topic between father and son
larry was a man grown then and his
mother had been dead for three years
his father with the touch of death gray-
ing his face had managed to lift the veil
of a mans reserves for a brief moment
that his son might look past it into the
hell inhabited by the jealous-that self
heated pit of torture and degradation into
which he had descended

  its a disease laurence a disease and
a vice in one its progressive every
time one yields to it makes the next at-
tack worse and hastens it too you may
have inherited it-

  larry raeburn could not help the em-
phatic shake of his head it was un-
thinkable that he should have inherited
the faintest taint

  you think so because you havent
faced the situation yet you cant be
jealous in my way unless you care care
like the devil you dont care that way
when you do youll understand what
ive been through but if you keep a
grip on yourself if you dont yield the
first time-

  i wont larry spoke quickly he
hated the topic his father was dying
and he wanted a different memory of
these last days

  they never recurred to the subject
kent raeburn died and his son followed
him to his place at mount hope con-
scious of a sudden solitude a feeling tha

he was alone in a world of enemies with
none to stand at his back

  he went on with his life however al-
most as if there had been nc change the
same old sun-enfiladed georgian house
the same familiar servants the same or-
dered routine provided a slow anodyne
for the consciousness of loss he was
distracted too by the sudden need to
step into kent raeburns place in the
business in which till now he had been
a rather condescending lieutenant tle
job of management impressed him with a
tardy respect for his father kent rae-
burn had made it seem easy to keep the
ramified structure in order his son
found it an absorbing exigent affair
gradually however he fitted himself for
the new demands upon him acquired
something of his fathers seemingly cas-
ual case in controlling his affairs there
was a little leisure again-evenings when
the pressing problem of some business
issue did not provide him with mental
occupation occasional holidays a steady j
widening of his horizon so that he be-l
came conscious once more of its empti-
ness began to feel the need of human j
contacts to replace in some measure 
those that had sufficed

  he had few friends and no intimates j
college had failed to bring him the usual 
array of happy comradeships later years
had been dedicated to business and books
he belonged only to his fathers old club j
for which his name had been proposed
the day of his birth and to a rather in-
discriminate college alumni association
which maintained the semblance of a
club he never visited either if he had
formed the usual commonplace friend-
ships he might have schooled himself
better against his unsuspected weakness
the congenitally jealous can feel almost
the same hot hatred of sharing a goodj
friend that maddens them at the hint off
sharing love but larry raeburn never
tested himself

  he had shunned what social outlets
opened before him empty chatter ove
roger hartman



  other peoples dinners did not attract him
  dancing was a silly waste of time he
  had an associated antipathy for these
  things growing out of the ease with
  which they had precipitated those ugly
  quarrels between his parents nearly al-
  ways his fathers banked fire of jealousy
  had burst into flame after some dinner-
  party or dance larry without realizing
  why kept away from them in the nat-
  ural course of things he should have
  grown old slowly without changing his
  ways a self-sufficient bachelor wrapped
  in business and books yet when he
  woke on his thirtieth birthday a sudden
  terror came on him a cold shuddering
  horror of age and loneliness of the total
  extinction which childless men face as
  the years draw down he saw his life
  suddenly as if it belonged to another
  man as if it were a finished completed
   object

 ive got to do something he told
himself as he dressed ill be old be-
 fore i know it-old and alone this
  wont do

    the thought lingered with him through
  ithe day an undertone below his shrewd
  q processes of business meditation it came
  home with him to his empty house that
   night stared at him across his silent din-
  itner-table followed him into the library
  and intruded itself before the page of the
  c sober book he tried to read

    old and alone it warned him old
  isjnd alone    old and alone
  i  he put down the book and paced the
  oom restlessly he mustnt let this
  pod grow on him why thirty was
  u outh almost boyhood it was all non-
  utnsc if he were fifty now    he
  b ad a sudden flashing picture of himself
  rt t fifty and the cords of his throat tight-
  -ied old and alone   

  lit drove him out at last it followed
    ojn mercilessly as he walked briskly
    rpay from the sombre silence of the dig-
    -j ed backwater in which he lived seek-
    f instinctively the meretricious com-
    r hy of lights and crowds he walked

along a thronged pavement glaring with
the unreal luminance of multiplied mcan-
descents a deep score between towering
walls against which complex electric ad-
vertisements shrieked and capered for the
casual eye there was no comfort in the
roar of traffic the pressure of alien
shoulders the snatches of speech the
laughter and frowns that were no affair
of his rather the spectacle of so much
in which he had no smalles share ag-
gravated his self-pity he let himself be
buttonholed by a sidewalk ticket-seller a
gross repellant presumptuous animal
who pawed him affectionately and yam-
mered about a seat he would sell at a
dead loss-because its you brother

  it shamed laurence raeburn to realize
that the fellows affectation of interest in
him was actually welcome he was
pleased to find himself an object of even
such attentions the reaction intensified
his sudden consciousness of his loneli-
ness a man who was pleased because
a smirking speculator fawned on him-
but he had already bought the seat and
an inborn sense of thrift forbade his
wasting the price of it he glanced at
the bit of card looked along the stutter-
ing signs and identified the theatre to
which it promised admittance he hard-
ly ever wtent to such affairs but it would
be better than nothing perhaps he
moved deliberately toward the sign af-
terward he was able to convince him-
self that he had been vaguely conscious
of an inner unexplained excitement as
if he neared a crisis in life it is ab-
surdly easy to confuse coincidence with
destiny the best and the shrewdest of
us fall into that same error

  just think sighs the waitress ec-
static over a twenty-five cent movie and
an intricate confection of syrups and
fruits if you hadnt of came to my

the eighth devil

we can smile over it in others but rarely
observe it in ourselves for instance if
 myself had not missed my train by in-
sisting on getting exactly the magazine i
wanted  shouldnt have- but that uas
destiny of course we were following
laurence raeburn down a dim aisle es-
corted by a gir in a colonial uniform to
a seat in the mathematical centre of the
twelfth row fie quailed at the glare
of the ponderous man in the aisle seat
whose shirt-bosom creaked as he rose to
let the late-comer pass hating himself
raeburn slid by several silken knees
muttering an inanity of excuse with-
out removing his overcoat he dropped
into his vacant chair eager to be incon-
spicuous something soft collapsed un-
der him and a voice at his side exclaimed
in wordless consternation his ears
burned as he rescued the mutt and mum-
bled an abject apology a sniff silenced
him he slouched in his seat trying to
catch the thread of the play the stage
was practically dark except where a cel-
luloid fire endeavored to look like a real
one he was intrigued instantly by the
actors voice that came out of the shad-
ows-a pleasing eager earnest voice
talking breathlessly making the sort of
love that a man makes only once in his
life-none of your usual rounded periods
of stage courtship but the stumbling
slovenly speech of a man who has for-
gotten to listen to himself who has for-
gotten even thing in the universe except
the girl who listens

  raeburn found himself artlessly hop-
ing the girl would be nice about it he
liked the invisible actor and wanted him
to get whatever it was he could ask for
like that for a moment it was curious-
ly real then the lights went on and a
crowd of shouting practical-jokers de-
bouched on the stage clamoring over the
prank by which the man with the nice
voice had been lured to the point of pro-
posal on some silly wager the unreality
of it alienated raeburns interest he
looked carefully at the girl beside him

her face visible in the glow of the foot-
lights he managed this without turn-
ing his head and his oblique eyes were
fairly trapped by hers-so fairly that for 
ail instant the two glances clashed and
clung accusingly then she smiled and
he had an absurd sense of relief

  why its mr raeburn she spoke
under her breath as if his presence were
a remarkable phenomenon of nature
raeburn recognized her now he knew
her father and mother remotely and he
had seen her too perhaps a doren times
in his life what was her name now
bess or tess or jess some ridiculott
diminutive anyway no les that was t
it short for leslie probably or some j
other exotic name just like mrs paul-
ding to choose something fanciful

  how do you do miss paulding he j
had resumed a whispered apology when j
she silenced him with a sharp hsst as
faces turned impatiently toward the dis- j
turbance he relapsed into abashed si- j
lence but now instead of following the-i
counterfeit glimpse of life on the stage i
he studied her protected by her trank j
absorption in the play she was certainyj
charming odd that he hadnt noticed
that curve of the cheek or the way the
lashes lay along it pretty teeth too   j
and that trick of opening her mouth when
she laughed    little bars of light in
her hair    he was suddenly aware
of a monstrous desire to lift his fingers
to the softly lustrous mass of it

  the curtain fell and rose and felj
then lights and an annoying orchestra 
which dimmed suddenly into a remote
background as she turned to him

  how did you get that seat she de-
manded abruptly her eyes lighted and
alert its the strangest thing

  he told her wondering a little
was informed breathlessly that
ticket he had bought had been dropped
on the pavement as her father left
car he had meant to turn it in at t
window because the fourth member
the party hadnt been able to
roger hartman



  w asnt it queer that things should happen
  the way they did raeburn had a sense
  of the intervention of destiny if he
  hadnt come out if hed come a different
  way or a moment later or sooner if
  somebody else had bought that found
  ticket if  oh there were a thousand
  of those is    he managed to talk
  not too clumsily after exchanging smiles
  and nods with her father and mother
  the pauldings let them alone raeburn
  didnt dream that mrs paulding was dis-
  cussing with an amused husband the
  possibility of further developments from
  this chance meeting but he accepted
  t with grateful humility the direct conse-
  quence of her speculations in the form
  of an invitation to join them at supper
  when the play was over

also he learned that the name wasnt
leslie after all but lester for some rea-
 son this seemed a tremendous affair les-
ter   lester    les  it suited
her amazingly he thought his respect
 for mrs paulding suddenly lifting he
i was thankful that she had a name quite
to herself there would have been a re-
l pugnant touch of the commonplace in
t anything less individual he sat beside
her in the car conscious of remote per-
h fumes of soft filmy fabrics of some-
i tiling infinitely fragile and precious a
j boys love at thirty is a desperate thing

	it has the intensity and heat with which
  the diseases of infancy attack the non-
  immunized adult laurence raeburn
  was going through the emotional reac-
  tions normal to eighteen they would
  have done him no violence in the elastic-
  ity of youth but they rent him now
  with an exquisite agony at supper
  he could not tear his eyes from the girl

   sue managed to glorify her bit of salad
  to make her single glass of wine seem a
  holy thing

   nothing softens a woman so quickly
 as the sort of worship that looked out of
 -arry raeburn s eyes at lester paulding
 not even the artful evasions of the prac-
 ticed wooer can accomplish so much or

so swiftly lester paulding knew that
this man was her dog she liked him be-
cause he surrendered so abjectly and so
instantaneously it ministered to her
pride and she was susceptible to attack
from that quarter which would have
found her armed arid fortified from any
other there was the insidious finger of
coincidence counterfeiting destiny too
   she was familiar with the casual
flippant almost cynical attentions of
very sophisticated very young men who
made a joke of nearly everything serious
and could be serious only about a joke
men who told her carelessly that her
dress was stunning or that she didnt
dance badly there had been of course
in her own salad period a few intense
short-lived affairs which had taught her
not to wear her emotions on her sleeve
it was a distinct novelty to feel instantly
the rapt sober fascination of a man ten
years older than she a man with the
repute of a recluse as far as feminine
affairs were concerned she was flat-
tered and a little awed and a great deal
pleased

  she was nice to laurence raeburn
therefore but she took pains not to be
too nice and to temper her warmth
toward him she used the inevitable de-
vice of referring casually to other men
letting him know that she was popular
letting him infer that there was a great
deal of competition something stabbed
raeburn with a hot sickening thrust at
every light mention of jimmy doanc or
phil breck or tommy saulsbury he
might have guessed what the first of them
them portended but he did not he was
in no condition of mind to think clearly
he only knew that a red film swam be-
fore his eyes at her words conjured up
unflattering portraits of the men she
named that something twisted in his soul
like the savage turn of a notched blade
in a fresh wound

  hes jealous diagnosed lester paul-
ding happily and she proceeded to
probe delicately to make sure it de-

lighted her to discover anything so naive
so elemental in a man who seemed at-
tracted to her tommy saulsbury to
whom she had been provisionally engaged
for an experimental fortnight or two had
been tiresomely unexcited when dick
phelps also in a tepid fashion had pro-
posed to her she remembered indeed
that he had construed it in some intricate
process of masculine logic as a compli-
ment to himself something told her
that laurence raeburn would not have
taken it so she was a little frightened
at a revealing flash in his deep-set gray
eyes and inevitably attracted by the hint
of danger all in all if destiny had
really played with their two lives that
night had dropped that pasteboard where
only that fat oleaginous speculator might
find it had led raeburn straight to the
curbstone angle where he waited for his
prey she could scarcely have managed it
better

  laurence raeburn went home in the
clutch of a nascent passion that shook
him as a tree in a tempest and lester
paulding sat quite a long time in front
of her dressing-table studying herself
through his eyes and smiling softly at the
reflection

  incidentally her mother annoyed her
father for the better part of a conjugal
post-mortem lasting a full hour by a
truly feminine assumption that it was all
over but the ceremony he did not be-
lieve anything of the sort but he had a
paternal glow of satisfaction that a fel-
low like raeburn should show so much
interest in his little girl he had been
observing his daughters friends with a
growing distaste for their precocious
sophistications it comforted him to en-
tertain a vision of les safely married to
a man like raeburn-clean and honest
and steady a fixed quantity whose fu-
ture could be forecast accurately

  raeburn displayed an unexpected ca-
pacity for action he knew only one
way of getting what he wanted-and he
used that way with a kind of ferocity

on their third meeting he told lester
quite bluntly that he loved her and he
made it so different from the casual
declarations of her experience that she
took him soberly instead of tormenting
him with evasions

  i-i think i care too laurence she
told him   dont know its quite dif-
ferent from anything-

  she saw his eyes flame redly

  do you mean that-that youve been
interested in anybody else his voice
choked and his big steady hand closed
till the knuckles whitened

  she was thrilled

  not-not in earnest laurence
she was amazed to find herself on the
defensive of course ive liked loads
of people but never-

  his face cleared slowly

  then you-youll take me he
was abject again the suppliant the
suitor she felt her power return

  ill have to think -i must be sure
you know she watched him out of a
corner of a lowered eye anticipating the
next move she meant to let him kiss
her-once but he held back unaccount-
ably her pride prodded her it wasnt
in nature for a provisionally accepted
suitor to show self-control she let her
hand touch his and swayed ever so light-
ly toward him still he kept himself
rigid aloof though she felt his wrist
tremble she laughed deep in her throat

  arent you going to help me-de-
cide she whispered and lifted her
blank eyes very innocently to his he
swept her roughly into his arms a crude
clumsy embrace as unstudied as the kiss
that hurt her lips she struggled a mo-
ment sighed and relaxed it was won-
derful to be really loved after all this
was quite different

  he released her suddenly abashed
apologetic

  forgive me dear i-i-

  she drew in a deep breath her fingers
rising to her hair her cheeks very pink

  you couldnt help it any more than
roger hartman



 i could i-i think ive decided lau-
 rence if you want me-

   if his voice shook again her
 sense of power wanned her

   then i think some day-

  to-morrow he had her hands
again his eyes burning into hers she
laughed delightedly he was wonderful
she told herself

  you absurd person months and
 months at least

   he broke into disjointed pleadings
 which she parried cleverly enough but
 he beat her down steadily day by day
 she was alarmed when he had gone to
 find that she stood bound to marry him in
 a month it frightened her when she was
 alone but the idea thrilled too she
 hadnt expected anything like his old-

 	fashioned intensity she had looked
 forward to marrying some agreeable

	young man who would be quite casual
 i about the whole thing this sudden

	blast of passion tempted her even more
  than it dismayed her she saw in it
  only the reflection of herself her power
  overa man far older than she a man
  who mattered who had arrived
 j her mother felt it necessary to weep
 j a little at the news but though she
 j argued mostly against losing her baby
 i she was very careful not to quarrel with
 the date arranged for the loss paulding
  patted lesters cheek and hugged her
 j lightly but she knew that he was light-
 ing a stubborn sorrow below his obvious
 j relief

   ill hate giving you to anybody les
 j-but raeburns about the best there is
 he-youll always know what he is and
 vwhere he is ill feel safer

   as for larry raeburn locked in his
 bedroom he was looking straight down
 jinto hell she had meant that he should
 kiss her that was why she had touched
  his hand why she had come close to him
 like that why she had challenged him
 with that mischievous speech somebody
 ifrad taught her to do those things some-
 body had kissed her-perhaps many

 somebodies she was a woman to bring
 a world of men to her feet the fire
 she had lighted in him she must have
 kindled in every other man who had
 looked upon her how many of them
 had held her-kissed her  he
 started to his feet

  god the word came through his
teeth dad was right ive got the
same cursed thing in me that wrecked
him  never guessed-

  he seized his mind relentlessly as a
strong man may sometimes and forced
back the blur of red rage of explosive
suspicion

  it beat dad he whispered hut its
not going to beat me ill fight it out
to a finish right here

  he went to bed at last reassured it
was a hideous thing but you could stran-
gle it if you leaped at it the instant it
showed its ugly face over your shoulder
hed settled it once for all there was-
nt any room in laurence raeburn wait-
ing swept and garnished for the seven
devils his doors were barred and
bolted and he stood on guard behind
them

  but the eighth devil retreating a lit-
tle laughed to himself he didnt need
an empty place or a welcome let the
poor fool think he had won it would
make things easier when the time came

ii

  and so they were married and wholly
resolved to live happily ever afterward
lester made a bride more ravishly ador-
able than even raeburns forevisions had
painted for him her mother had man-
aged ever-thing so there wasnt a jarring
note about the quiet little wedding at
saint godfreys or the charming little
breakfast that followed the october
day had been the distilled essence of in-
dian summer there was a sky like a
hollow pearl and the faint keen breath
of burning leaves on the waft of a gen-
the eighth devil

ial wind people had said exactly the
right things and left the wrong ones un-
spoken the presents had exceeded les-
ters notion of her due laurence had
acted beautifully so that she was con-
scious of a new sort of pride in him ahd
in herself because he adored her so tre-
mendously and obviously all in all it
was a perfect beginning for a perfect
life

  the wedding journey went well too
and those intricate processes of mutual
adjustment which upset so many prom-
ising beginnings proved that this marriage
was solidly founded in love and truth
for all lesters inclination to take the
light view of weighty matters and the
ponderous view of frivolous concerns
laurence raeburn managed to wake the
self-centred girl to some reflected glow
of his own white flame if she did not
reach his levels she climbed near enough
to let him think her feet beside his own
there was no rift no flaw no regret no
hint of a quarrel they came back to
the old mellow georgian house as near
to perfect happiness as two human beings
may-safely come

  even after she had been settled in her
own home for months so that the nov-
elty of managing a household to suit
herself had had time to wear away the
thrill of being able to charge whatever
pleased her fancy of feeling the half-
envious eves of her old friends paying
tribute to her luck lester raeburn was
still contented mildly pleased with her-
self and with life just when the
eighth devil found his opening she
could not have told but it must indeed
hive been a very gradual affair prob-
ably it began in that inevitable process
of settling down which must follow
every romance the gradual reversion to
levels after the heights the let-down of
emotion from tensity to placidity

  there is a considerable gulf between
twenty-three and thirty at the best of
it there was a wider temperamental
chasm between these two lester want-

ed lights and laughter the flow of merry
speech the flash of wits the hint of ad-
miration in other eyes she wanted to
see a good many plays to go to more
dances and dinners in a month than lau-
rence raeburn had attended in his life-
time she was very much the normal
young woman of her day utterly aban-
doned to the cult of the good time
while her husband even among men of
his generation was already settled in a
habit of practical self-sufficiency he
had room in his life for lester but no
need of others having her he would
have been utterly content to live on 
desert island provided it were well sup-
plied with books and possessed a con- 
venient well-appointed office to occupy
him between ten and five slowly as i
they reverted to their respective levels
they drew apart this was no tragedy
for laurence raeburn at the first of it

he realized no defect so long as lester
was in his house when he came home
to it opposite him at dinner across the r
wide book-laden table in the library af-
terward but it was suffocating for the
girl and the sharp flaming quarrel that 
broke the growing tension took raeburn
utterly by surprise

   it subsided of course in mutual apol- 
ogies and tears and kisses and conces- 
sions raeburn rebuked himself for not 
having realized the difference in age and 
taste for having taken it for granted that -
this placid existence suited les as well
as it satisfied him readily enough he
promised better things for the future 
they patched up a damply affectionate
truce and began all over again but it
was only a few weeks before they re-
peated the outburst and in a groping
effort to strike back at him for a curtly
bitter comment on the intellectual vacuity
that requires light opera to fill it lester
found her weapon she spoke angrily

  very well ive given you your
chance you want to sit here night af-
ter night drowsing over your stupid
books you dont consider me im to
roger hartman



knit i suppose or go to bed very well
you arent the only man on earth nor
the only one who ever took an interest
in me i shant have to amuse myself-
long

  the stabbing gleam of his eyes fright-
ened her she thought that his clenched
hand was about to strike her and drew
back from its menace in sudden terror
staring at his contorted furious face

  who is he the words choked him
tell me-who is he

  she saw at once that his fury was
centred on the mythical third person and
her fear sank as quickly as it had risen
a malicious sense of her power quick-
ening in her alert brain he was madly
jealous after all-jealous as she had fan-
cied he was long ago she held her fire
thinking quickly then

  dont be silly laurence you act
like othello there isnt anybody in par-
ticular of course i meant that if you
wouldnt consider me id find somebody
who would i still mean that

  he had himself under control again
but the effort shook him and the toxins
of rage were poisoning him as he strug-
gled for calm speech

  les dont ever try that tack again
i-you dont understand what it means
to be jealous i-

  she shrugged her shoulders coldly se-
cretly delighted at the confession of the
word

  its thoroughly despicable-i quite
understand that she said primly its
a beastly horrid ungentlemanly vice
im surprised that you should admit it
he hesitated groping for words her
adjectives were just he knew there
was nothing less admirable than his sort
of jealousy but if she deliberately pro-
voked it he foresaw that no effort of his
own will could prevent outbreaks like
those to which he had listened disgusted
and terrified as a boy it occurred to
him in the midst of his abasement that
his mother had painfully avoided other
men always had schemed cannily to give

his father no flimsiest foundation for his
rages suppose she had tried instead
to torment him    he had a quivering
realization of averted tragedy a man
thoroughly jealous is mad he may do
unspeakable things

  i have fought it-hard he said
quietly suppose i inherited a craving
for drink you wouldnt put tempta-
tion in my way would you  youd help
me fight it help me fight this les 
need your help

  she had a vague consciousness of deep
waters but her mood was hostile she
shook her head stubbornly

  thats a cowards excuse the wom-
an tempted you  i wonder i f theres any
contemptible thing men do for which
they cant manage to blame some wom-
an i dont care to talk about this lau-
rence im going to bed

  she expected him to follow and it
piqued her that he let her go without pro-
test in her room she reflected soberly
on the discovery

  one thing it gives me a tremendous
power over him  she smiled at the
thought i mustnt overdo it though
the eighth devil crept up to the fire
and grinned joyously as he wanned his
hands

ill

  lester raeburn had found her touch-
stone it was chance only that she found
it so soon for the knowledge of that
hereditary flaw in her husband must have
come inevitably with the years she
knew now that she held an insidious
power over the mans soul it was as
though he were a drug addict one utter-
ly given to-some rare and potent intoxi-
cant of which she held all the worlds
supply to give or to deny as seemed good
to her at first she found it a little dis-
maying like being married to doctor
jekyll and finding that it involved mar-
raige too to fr hyde the compar-
ison struck her fancy stevenson had


the eighth devil

described amazingly the transformation
which her drug could work in laurences
calm and restraint she must be very
careful never to excite him in public she
told herself as she contemplated the fu-
ture he was perfectly capable of mak-
ing horrible scenes she detested scenes
she had been carefully bred to detest
nearly everything that was frankly real
life had made her a tissue of elaborate
concealments and inhibitions a fabric of
manners and conventions no less con-
ventional because they called themselves
the opposite of convention she said
once with a shrug of her white shoul-
ders that emotions were raw affairs-
impossible unless properly prepared dis-
guised spiced and sauced it was a
rather apt expression of the whole cult
and creed of that world in which she
had been formed

  she used her weapon sparingly at first
and always cleverly she did not fall
into the error of letting raeburn see her
reasoning always she contrived to kindle
that sudden flame of blind fury in him as
if without intention once it was no
more than a letter which she burned with
rather more care than seemed necessary
-a letter that bore a club monogram
made horribly visible for an eternity of a
second as the flames blackened the
creamy paper there had been a brief
awful clash over her refusal to answer
his hoarse demands for instant explan-
ation confession in the end as she had
counted on doing she shamed him into
abject apology self-abasement it was
a conquest that she used to extract no
bigger concession than acceptance of an
invitation at which he had rebelled

  again she had recourse to the simple
device of sending herself orchids with-
out a card and cooing over them so that
laurence could see and hear affecting
not to be aware of his proximity she
humbled him again aloof contemptuous
inwardly charmed at this new proof of
her power and of his devotion

  really laurence i dont understand

inyseif i should have thought that i
couldnt ever forgive this-this vulgar
vice if you had seen your face-

 ou looked like a murderous navvy

 es i suppose i forgive you but this
cant go on if im to live my life never
knowing when the most trivial act or
speech will precipitate a drunken flood
of billingsgate-

   help me then youre my wife
its a fight-a fight against a common
enemy trying to ruin our lives god
knows i dont minimize the ugliness ot
it if k seems hideous to you what do
you think it seems to me why les -
it-its like a real physical poison i
ache with it now help me dear-dont
madden me with denials with that dis-
dainful refusal to answer calm me as
quickly as you can by explaining

  her lips curved

   thanks i dont feel that my duty
goes quite so far a gentleman-

  he made a gesture of impatience

  a gentleman is no different from any
oilier beast when the devil slips into his
soul its a condition weve got to face
les-not an ideal

  she shrugged her shoulders

  well let s not talk about it i-i
want to forget please you said 

  it was easy enough to collect her in-
demnity now she levied it relentlessly
to the uttermost farthing

  sometimes she saw that he controlled
the first demoniac impulses the veins
stood out on his forehead and his face
reddened blotchily his wrists quivering
as his will strained against their muscles
but his lips stubbornly sealed on thee
occasions generally she contrived to
give he needed extra fillip to his taut
nerves to aggravate the slight founda-
tion of his suspicions until the storm
burst on them both it was refreshing
she discovered there was a kind of ex-
hilaration in the rapier-play of her cold
contemptuous intelligence against the
savage bludgeonings of bis frenzy sle

roger hartman



him down brought him to his knees
spent shamed remorseful

  gradually too she found a certain
pleasure in the process of reconciliation
he was abject always after the fury
passed a humble suppliant begging for
a crumb of forgiveness it brought back
something of the mildly pleasing thrill of
his first desperate devotion she felt
herself imbued with a sense of power of
regality a cleopatra whose casual ges-
ture might mean life or death she
came in time to stirring him up as
she described it in her thought for the
mere satisfaction of the postludes she
used his jealousy as the most convenient
means of kindling the old humbled at-
titude which the normal man loses in the
usage of marriage and the normal wom-
an never ceases to regret

  she became very clever at it with
practice it was amusing to plan a new
scheme of attack whefi life bored her
sometimes she plotted out her ideas as
she lay awake waiting for elusive sleep
she amused herself with premeditations
when a journey wearied her or someone
kept her waiting at an appointed tryst
thus there was the simple matter of
igniting a cigar at the grate when rae-
burn had spent a rare evening away from
home so that the library was heavy with
the strong odor when he came in she
knew that he would detect it instantly
for his detestation of cigar smoke in the
house was one of his few stubborn
foibles when he had regained his self-
control she disdainfully pointed to the
charred stub inside the fender and told
him truthfully that she had thrown it
into the fire herself it had dropped on
the floor and she had stepped on it how
had it come there she shrugged no
doubt one of the servants had accident-
ally let it fall from the tray wasnt it
the brand he kept for his guests

  so again she tortured him with the
cruder expedient of the late homecom-
ing letting him pace the floor while din-
ner waited and refusing to answer his

peremptory demand for explanations un-
til they had run the usual emotional
gamut and reached the abject stage of
self-abasement then she condescended
to tell him truthfully enough that she had
been delayed at her mothers and suggest
that he verify her statement over the tele-
phone

  she had  pity for him to her view
his tantrums were no more than vulgar
lapses into crude debasing suspicion
mere plunges of his wilful choice into
the mire if he suffered-and she was
skeptical about this-it was his own
fault and richly merited she had no
difficulty in justifying herself to herself
he deserved to be teased she argued in-
wardly because he yielded to an utterly
unworthy passion on such scanty provo-
cation it lay according to her view
wholly within her husbands power to
control his temper if he chose to give
it free rein that was his affair mean-
while the process of vivisecting his emo-
tions amused her and the aftermath of-
forded her a gentle echo of honeymoon
days not unpleasing for through it all
she was fond of him as fond as a thor-
oughly self-centred woman may be of
anyone she would have called it love
certainly it was as near love as she could
come

  she observed with a lazy amusement
that he made some progress in self-con-
trol as usage hardened him under her
subtle provocations he no longer
flamed at the first spark it needed a
constantly increasing degree of care to
bring him to the point of explosion the
little hints which had maddened him at
first no longer roused him she might
challenge him with letters with flowers
with elaborately timed tardinesses and
find him good-humored levelly placid
even stronger stimuli lost their effect
she discovered he watched her dance
brilliantly with reppelier stokes notori-
ously a loose sort without even com-
menting on the circumstance as they
drove home she ventured at last to


the eighth devil

speak of it disguising her reference un-
der a thankfulness wholly insincere

  larry dear youre ever and ever so
much better about-about your jealousy

i-i ve been meaning to thank you

   he smiled lazily

  pure mental science les ive been
giving myself regular baths in it building
up resistance on a solid fact-foundation
you see if i know its absurd to suspect
and keep telling myself so when theres
nothing suspicious in evidence it helps
me over the bad moments when some lit-
tle circumstance might set me off i
know you arent a bit interested in any-
body else i know exactly who your
friends are and how you spend your
time and i know you too thats the
main thing when im sane i know that
youre everything thats honest and clean
and fine i keep that right in the front
of my mind all the time and when 
see red i can snatch at the truth and
hold on tight till ive battered the devil
back into his den see

  she saw rather too clearly he was
curing himself after all by this rear-
entrance scheme of undermining suspi-
cion before it existed he was settling
down to a stodgy middle-aged certainty
of her that would certainly end by kill-
ing the instinct of jealousy in him and
she didnt want it killed she had come
by now to think of it as the one sure
way of keeping alive the devotion on
which she had learned to lean so heavily
jealousy of larry raeburns sort was
distinctly a matrimonial asset it meant
that life couldnt relapse to the dead
monotone of humdrum take-it-for-grant-
ed placidity there would be stimulating
heights and giddy depths so long as he
did not utterly stamp out the madness

  it was her fault of course no won-
der he was sure of her she had made
it absurdly evident all along she had
been particularly careful never to give
him the least real foundation for the sus-
picions she had so laboriously inspired
her fear of a possible public scene had

kept her from risking the innocert
friendships with other men in which most
of the married women she knew were 
continually beguiling their boredom
naturally his suspicions were absurd
when he sat down deliberately to examine
them she veiled her eyes so that he
might not see the disappointment in them

  tm glad youre so sensible larry
ive tried terribly hard to avoid even the
appearance of evil-always it-its my
reward

  he kissed her it was a husbandly
kiss a tolerant friendly affair as pas-
sionless as a potato and she watched
him submerge contentedly in a ponderous
book her brain was busy with a new
idea

  he mustnt be too sure of me-ever
she told herself ive got to change
that-right away it-it ought not to be
too difficult

  the eighth devil hugged his sides

iv

  from the day of that latest discovery
lester raeburn began to cultivate very
carefully the semblance of evil she
had cleverness of sorts and used it to
excellent effect in her preliminary medi-
tations on ways and means a duller
woman would have lessened suspicion by
dividing it lester centred on one man
and she chose him rather cleverly as be-
ing the most likely type to enrage larry
a man whom he disliked personally and
whose habit and view and personality
were all diametrically opposite to his
own

  murray jessop was a careful idler he
shunned effort in all shapes as sedulous-
ly as some men avoid temptation he
drifted but he was exceedingly thought-
ful about the current that carried him
taking indolent pains to be sure that it
should not drag him into rapids or over
falls he played with life in warm
friendly shallows resigned to leaving to
roger hartman



more energetic men the good things to
be gained only at the price of effort to
having tor himself only what drifted
within his reach he was exactly the
sort of man to attract laurence rae-
burns severest contempt-a drone a
non-producer no less a parasite because
he had inherited enough money to main-
tain him in sloth morally to be sure
jessop was not particularly reprehensible
simply because sinning for the most part
demanded an effort he was not willing to
exert he had no purple history and
yet there were few husbands who would
have surveyed with philosophic calm his
intimacy in their houses

  yet raeburn contemplated without
comment the spectacle of a growing
friendliness between lester and jessop
if he doubted his wife he contrived to
keep the question at bay his new self-
control proved equal to the steadily in-
creasing strain lester put upon it he
went his ways methodically as always
his even humor untroubled so tar as
lester could see slowly she tried him
farther obtruding on his observation evi-
dences of interest in jessop which a few
months before would have wakened him
to instant fury he was perversely
dense or more perversely complaisant
she could not prod him into even mild
objection

  scarcely realizing that it was only the
reflex of her annoyance she slipped eas-
ily into an intimacy with murray jessop
which had had no place in her plans
the quiet indolent fellow fitted admira-
bly into the fabric of her life he gave
no trouble he was never exigent never
sulky never difficult and within limits
he was to be counted on for amusement
she began to rely on him heavily-more
heavily than she knew-as raeburn
drifted back into absorption in his busi-
ness and left her more and more to her
own concerns

  and yet through it all her attitude
toward her husband changed steadily to-
ward the side of a deeper attachment

than before having taken him for
granted from the first she had been in-
clined to hold him cheaply now as she
became unwillingly aware that her power
over him was weakening her fondness
intensified into something very much like
love he was hers she had a right to
his devotion she wanted it wanted those
glowing recrudescences of the early fires
wanted him as he had been    his
seeming inattention to jessops intrusions
only persuaded her that she had not gone
far enough he might have conquered
his besetting vice a little he had learned
how to control those facile rages that had
flung him abashed and humbled at her
feet when the fun was spent but below
the surface waiting his moment was her
ancient ally ready to spring to her aid
when she found the right appeal

  the more she contemplated the new
status of her life and its relations the
more certain it seemed to her that sht
was on the right track in using tessoj
as the means of kindling the old fire ir
laurence raeburn she had not gon
far enough along that path that was all
very cautiously she went farther watch-
ing laurence shrewdly for some hint o
her success

  murrays going to take me out to
northport this afternoon-lotta jud-
sons you know you dont mind do you
dear old boy 

   he shook his head

   not a bit sorry i cant get away
but-

   but you dont like lotta she cut in
 striving to make her eagerness a shade
 suspicious i dont want you to be
 bored you know

   he grinned amiably and lapsed into hi
 paper she was angry-thoroughly an
 gry was he merely stupid or didnt h
 care  what had happened-what could
 have altered him so radically that he
 could look on unstirred while his wife
 pointedly flirted with a man like murray
 jessop

   she meditated soberly on the problem


the eighth devil

she could use a little more pressure per-
haps there were ways    she
planned shrewdly if she gave him some-
thing unmistakably damning to consider
   he might explode but she could al-
ways fall back on the truth always tell
him that she had been trying to help him
conquer his weakness by building up his
powers of resistance

   so it happened quite naturally that
murray jessop was gently persuaded into
something like a display of ardor he
wasnt utterly immune to deft stimula-
tion and lester raeburn could be re-
markably provocative when she chose
jessop would have laid no siege to her or
any other woman but he took what the
lazy little gods he worshiped were be-
nign enough to put within reach he
kissed her with rather more earnestness
than was characteristic of him just as
raeburn came in lester tense and
braced for the scene listened desperately
for the first roaring blast of her hus-
bands rage she felt as if she must
scream unless he broke the tension
turning a little with jessops lightly
confident arm still about her she caught
her breath laurence had gone out with-
out a word jessop had not even known
of his presence

   in some fashion she got rid of him not
too brusquely she hadnt finished with
him yet she saw as he left that he was
puzled but she had no thought to waste
on his private bewilderments larry was
the only man who mattered-larry who
had watched another man kiss her with-
out lifting a finger to interfere she
found him in his room prosaically com-
fortable in dressing-gown and loose
rather slovenly slippers

    larry-i-i know you saw what hap-
pened just now-

   he nodded his eyes mildly amused

    yes he said quietly im quite sure
that yon -know i saw it you timed it
very nicely didnt you 

   she stared this wasnt larry rae-
burn-it couldi l be the man who had

been instant to flame into fury at the
faintest breath of suspicion what had
happened to him why didnt he fly
into his old passion of reproach

  you-you dont think- you know
i- she stammered clumsily groping
for the right phrase

  he laughed softly

  yes i know you les i knfw that
murray jessop never kissed you before
and never will again until you devil him
into it as you did to-night i know
youre technically as innocent as any
woman ever was dont disturb yourself
in the least please its quite all right i
understand-everything

  larry she let her hands fall on
his shoulders whats come over you
you act as if-as if you didnt care

  do i thats odd you know be-
cause i dont care-i dont care a single
tinkers damn what you do or say les
you wont make any trouble for your-
self im perfectly certain that neither
murray jessop or any other man will
ever interest you enough to make you
lose your balance and if it amuses you
to play with that sort of pets play all you
please    ah-h he yawned polite-
ly behind his hand dont fret-im not
a bit annoyed

   she stood still utterly at a loss

  but-but you talk as if you didnt
care-about me she complained it
isnt faith that makes you so complaisant
-its sheer disinterest

  oh thats rather strong he yawned
again im getting over some of the fol-
lies of my youth of course for in-
stance-his eyes narrowed suddenly-
for instance it isnt possible any longer
for a woman to tear my soul to pieces
just for her amusement youve cured
me of that at last i owe you a good
deal for that service jealousy is a de-
testable vice im done with it thanks
to you

  i dont understand it was almost a
wail larry larry dont you care any
more dont you love me
the burning bush



  he smiled thinly as he replied

  im very grateful to you it took me
a long time to discover that you were
playing with me-that you deliberately
provoked me into those fits of fury for
the fun of seeing me blaze and the satis-
faction of making me crawl to you after-
ward you faked those early experi-
ments-the letters and the flowers and
that infernal affair of the cigar and all
just as youve been faking this last busi-
ness with jessop-for the sheer pleasure
of watching me go mad i didnt under-
stand until this jessop affair began then
it dawned on me no les i dont care
youve cured me of being jealous and
youve cured me of caring enough to be
jealous let it go at that

  he was very nice to her of course
nobody could have been kinder about
comforting her calming her passion of
tears and entreaties but he might have
been a doctor impersonal aloof she

realized at last that she had lost him
perhaps it served her right to stare be-
fore her into barren desolate years
laurence raeburn thought so at least as
he tiptoed away from her door with the
sound of her sobs following him

  ive got to be mighty careful he
soliloquized as he turned his key she
mustnt ever suspect me it isnt safe for
her to think she has that power over me
still but i f shed been a little later  

  he took an ugly blunt revolver from
the deep pocket of his dressing-gown as  i
placed it carefully in a dresser drawer
as his eyes caught his image in the glas 
he fancied he got a glimpse of something
infinitely evil baffled drawing back

  the eighth devil cheated was re-
treating but laurence raeburn knew
that he was not beaten oddly enough
he was rather glad for when the eighth
devil dies he never dies alone love
dies with him   

 the burning bush

by edwin justus mayer

j think it was one spring a burning bush
   flamed sudden in the green hills of my youth

and a great voice spake out oi it the truth
of beauty and fell still a holy hush
succeeded it there was not any noise
of singing birds or rivers or of flowers
stirring in birth but all the level hours
were very silent as when nuns rejoice

new breath of a new spring how many springs

   have been since then since wild my dark eyes sighted
   the amazing bush with awe and frenzy lighted

and since my cars heard great imaginings
voiced in eternal tones  i do not know 

the years are filled with blinding deafening woe
in the good old days

by frank h williams

qh that ecstatic thrill oh that sweet shiver up the spine oh that delicious gulp

              in the throat do you remember that splendiferous day fellers when you bet
          your best girl a box of candy against a kiss and you won your bet t

              and that evening before going to collect you dolled up with your best red
          necktie and brushed your hair back from your ears and put on the good old fawn
          gloves with the smell of gasoline still clinging to them from the big cleaning and
          your nose looked sorta red so you dabbed it with a bit of your sisters powder and
          then rubbed it off for fear it might show and she would think you were a sissie
          when you went to her house she was out on the front porch with her father and
          her mother and her sisters and her brothers and her cousins and her uncles and her
          aunts

               she just wouldnt go for a walk around the block and she positively refused to
          go with you to the back yard to look at the grape arbor in the moonlight and she
          turned up her pretty stubby little nose when you suggested going to the drug store
          tor an ice cream suddy and you gloomily wondered if she were going to renege
          on the bet and you looked at her with a meaning look in your face while she blankly
          returned your gaze without a sign of comprehension and her dad noting your
          strange appearance asked you if your face hurt her mother looked at your fawn
          gloves and snickered and you felt yourself getting red and your hands were large
          and hot and you put them behind you and tried to take off the gloves but they
          sirnply wouldnt come

              oh boy how you fidgeted and wished youd stayed home you got so restless
         that one of the aunts an old maid who was sweet on the widower who had just gone
         by without paying much attention to her said for goodness sake keep still if
         you havent the st yitus dance  at that you colored up again like a cerise sun-
         shade

              finally the family ambled into the house one by one and very very slowly
         you hitched closer and closer to her and she looked at you shyly and didnt move
         away then she lifted up her pretty face a ittle as you took a firm grip on your
         courage and-and gave her a quick little peck on the cheek at that you heard a
         loud laugh and you looked around shamefacedly and there was her father and he
         said

              that wasnt much of a kiss mehitahel give little horace a nice big kiss

             whereupon you just naturally nearly passed away with mortification and
         jamming your hat down to your ears hurried away -without once looking back  ou
         kicked yourself all around the block and upstairs to your room and then you swore
         you were through with women for good little horace indeed
the plays the thing

       by an insider
       my southern molly-o 

all the mollies come either from
dixie or ireland and right off
the bat ill confess to a weakness
for the south and for southern mollies
with that fine sense of humor which char-
acterizes miss isabelle lowe those
writing gentlemen whose names are
quoted on eighth avenue ash cans and
in sixth avenue l stations would
never begin a critique this way i know 
instead of mentioning the lady first or
the play they mention-and star-them-
selves but after seeing the melting
of molly at the broadhurst theatre
ive just got to speak up and say that t
like isabelle lowe and she is  aphro-
dite of melos either 

  with that off of my chest i shall get
to work the program states that
messrs lee and j j shubcrt present
the melting of molly a new musical
comedy by maria thompson davies from
her novel of the same name by arrange-
ment with- but really it is too much-
much too much everybody but the un-
dertaker had a hand in fashioning molly
and he was left out because she is far
from being a dead one indeed she
seems to possess nine lives like a cat for
her career in the theatre at least has
been lengthy and varied first she was
presented without music as a straight
comedy and with a big name in the
lead then she was tried out minus the
name and with a charming young actress
-who promptly died or got married
then one person wrote the book and

another person added tunes and molly
became a musical comedy

   but the end was not yet for the first
attempt at syncopating molly was
thrown into the discard and as finally
seen in new york sigmund romlerg is
responsible for the melody edgar smith
for the libretto and miss lowe for much
of its success

  hailing from virginia mollys sur-
name of course is carter we first
meet the carters under the trees of their
fine old home where molly is waiting to
say au revoir to her lover alfred ben-
nett who is sailing for london  a dip-
lomatic errand alfred believes nt re-
pose his farewell kiss on mollys brow
is as ice-bound as behring strait he
loves the ethereal the spirituelle i can
well believe he walked down piccadilly
with a lily in his hand like the gentleman
in gilbert and sullivan slim correct is
alfred and while molly weeps at his de-
parture she is perfectly satisfied that he
has done her a great honor in engaging
himself to her even while there is john
moore john is in love with molly him-
self but the carters would have had none
of him even if molly hadnt loved al-
fred for john is only a poor young doc-
tor a poor young country doctor a poor
young country doctor in virginia but
john appreciates the hot biscuits which
judy the carter mammy bakes which
shows his good sense for i am told on
the side that judy is some cook molly
thinks so too but alfred bennett whis-




the plays the thing

pers indigestion and passes up the bis-
cuit so alfred leaves for london with
molly promising to wait for him and
wih john loving her-in vain as they
say in books

  four years pass alfred now a great
personage is still in london while the
carters have become addicted to that
famous indoor sport of dodging bill col-
lectors there are bills everywhere and
no money for with the death of mollys
father his fortune seems to have taken
wings judy is still with the family and
while she still bakes we first see her
ridding the house of the collectors with
the aid of a broom mrs carter confides
to her old friend judge wade that some-
thing must be done but she will not let
him help her and she doesnt know what
tliat something is to be now she re-
grets that molly didnt marry alfred
bennett before he went to london for
alfred has never returned to marry
molly nor has he sent for her to join him
in england and he has become quite a
wealthy man

  yes it would have been better if they
had married four years ago decides
mrs carter for as molly is to-day-

  then molly appears worry and pov-
erty have failed to leave their marks 
miss molly nero fiddled while rome
burned and molly fattened while the
carters starved l here is no money for
the butcher but molly appears calmly
munching chocolates molly is fat

  her kid sister dot who has been deco-
rated of late in mollys made-over
clothes finds the old wedding gown that
molly got four years ago in which to
rnrry alfred and dot wants it for a
dress for herself but molly while fat
is sentimental and she insists she is sav-
ing the old gown for her wedding with
mr bennett though as practical dot
points out the garment isnt half big
enough for the molly of to-day

  when judge wade suggests a lodger
mrs carter promptly faints but molly
thinks they will take one in thank you

the judge points out that he knows a
most excellent young man a doctor who
while waiting for his sanitarium to be
finished is anxious to secure home-like
accommodations in the neighborhood
molly says they will take him in and the
judge departs to find the fellow

  of course when he appears he is
none other than mollys other beau john
moore lie is now doctor moore and a
successful health and beauty specialist
with many interesting patients but he
still loves molly molly says that she
didnt know their lodger was to be he
and she is afraid he cannot stay when
john asks if she really dislikes him so
much molly shakes her head and the
thing is settled even to the breakfast
menu he pays for a month in advance
so that it begins to look as if the carters
were to be once more  intimate terms
with the butcher mrs carter insists
that a lodger a man in the house is the
very thing they needed-after she hears
of johns success and his continued in-
terest in molly-and everything is lovely
when a bomb is exploded in their midst

  after four years alfred bennett de-
cides that he wants to marry molly he
wants to marry molly in the little white
gown she prepared before he went to
london  he speaks of her as his dainty
lily-but molly confesses openly she
more nearly resembles a cauliflower as
for the little gown of course it wont
half meet yet alfred is coming in a
few short months to wed the lily maid
he left behind

  mother and sister are in despair john
insists that molly is just right and that if
bennett really loves her he wont care a
hoot whether bhe is plump or lean but
the carters know lie tier-they know
alfred the exquisite the ethereal even
judy recalls that he wouldnt eat her bis-
cuits and offers molly some anti-fat pills
with herself as a testimonial this isnt
encouraging with judy tipping the scales
at two hundred or more and molly de-
cides she must start in to reduce
an insider



  for youll never get into the old gown
molly unless you melt says sister dot

  then ill melt announces molly
even as you and i

  when he sees that she is in earnest
john says he will take her in hand and
throwing away judys medicine tells
molly to come to his new sanitarium he
promises to get her back in shape the
old shape in time to meet her elegant
lover from london but    she must
diet-which makes for an amusing finale
to the act when afternoon tea is brought
in with hot rich cakes straight from
judys kitchen and john keeps the con-
fection from molly and allows her only
tea minus cream and sugar

  in the next act we visit the famous
sanitarium with a lot of pretty young
women in gym togs the whole resembling
a scene from a keystone film the ath-
letic instructor is played by miss vera
roehrn a striking-looking young woman
who gives an excellent boxing exhibition
and effectively talks a song here in
the sanitarium we find molly at work
and she has begun to melt judging from
the trim figure she presents in her gym
suit john comes in as much in love as
ever but molly remains true to her
memories to be sure im not a lady
but just the same i cant understand how
mollys memories of alfred bennett
were so thrilling that one needs must be
hugging them always to ones breast
quite the contrary and i particularly
loathe cold potato

  judge wade has provided the neces-
sary money for mollys trousseau and
everything apparently is going well
when news is brought that alfred cant
get to america after all and that he
wants molly to marry him by proxy and
come to join him in london

  can it be done demands mrs car-
ter with visions of molly being wished
back on her hands i suppose

  the judge assures them gravely that a
marriage by proxy is perfectly legal
poor molly who has rolled starved and

what not for her wedding has only one
word to say-her husband by proxy must
be john which to a mere mans way of
thinking is very hard on john no
wonder he protests but molly wants it
so and after all he loves molly and so
he consents

  the last act takes us back again under
the trees on the lawn of the carter house
it is mollys wedding day and she has
married alfred-sort o through john y
know alfred with his secretary miss
chester has arrived directly after the
ceremony finding at the last moment that
he could manage the trip and escort his
bride back to england when molly ap-
pears youd expect to find her very happy
and everything with alfred in america
but the truth must be published-molly is
mad fighting mad when she shows her-
self to the bosom of her family she is
wearing the little white dress of four
years ago and while it is tight and she
has been warned to be careful in it she
has thanks to john moore melted her-
self away to almost her old weight
though she doesnt act at all at all like
a lily maid a lily on its straight slim
stem if molly is a lily then she is of
that variety known as tiger

  molly walks m to tell her family just
where she and they get off at she will
never go back to england with alfred
bennett she doesnt care if she is mar-
ried to him  she will divorce him  surely
there is some law- when she thinks of
how she has starved herself and worked
all these years she has hugged to her
breast sweet memories of her youthful
lover her spirituelle lover they try to
calm her nerves mrs carter pointing
out the value of bennetts social position
but the rest of them secretly feel that
molly has beeu banded a raw deal and
gladly leave her to john

  then alfred the ethereal appears with
his secretary and lo and behold alfred
is now the size of the baby elephant in
the zoo he must weigh a ton-at least
three hundred pounds he tells molly


the plays the thing

she may kiss him which she doesnt do
ihank pete and then he seta in to eat all
the food in sight and to talk about all
the food in europe as pate de foi gras
and caviar disappear as if by magic molly
says that now she understands the food
shortage in london alfred eats and
eats until even the audience feeis - little
faint a restaurant next to tiie theatre
would starve to death because one simply
couldnt eat after seeing mr bennett
stuff himself on the stage when judy
appears with a plate of hot biscuits which
alfred had scorned in younger days he
promptly takes over the plate and eats
at least a half dozen of its contents a
sauce a roast and an entree have been
named for him in london he speaks
glowingly of the gastronomic delights of
rome and he eats how he eats all
the time poor starved molly watches him
listens to him it is more than human
nature can stand and finally molly   
speaks

  molly says something in spite of
mother sister friends molly tells alfred
bennett just what she thinks of him just
how she waited trusted starved  for
the sake of an exquisite ethereal lover
who has returned looking for all the
world like wilhelmstrasse of yesteryears
as she lays down the law she forgets the
old dress her own increased waistline
and friendly warnings with every move
a button flies off until she stands half
out of her gown alfred blandly eating
at first finally reaches the conclusion that
molly isnt such a lily on a slender stem
as he thought when she insists that she
wont return to london with him that
she doesnt love him anyway there is a
momentary pause then john comes for-
ward with the announcement that molly
doesnt have to go to london with alfred
bennett for the good reason that she isnt
his wife he john had the forethought
to sign his name and not bennetts to
the marriage papers which makes molly
johns wife anrl not alfreds but not to
he robbed of a life partner alfred de-

cides to marry his secretary miss ches-
ter who i am satisfied will feed him
into the grave in a year 

  charles purcell is featured as john
moore though the honors go to isabelle
lowe who plays molly this is said
without disparagement to mr puree
who is a pleasing actor and a fine singer
as those of you who have seen his work
in maytime know it is simply that
molly is a womans play and miss
lowe is clever enough to seize each and
every opportunity

  isabelle lowe came from the hinter-
land and it is whispered that she served
a long apprenticeship in stock so did
fay bain ter now one of the most popu-
lar of broadways stars much has been
made of the fact that miss lowe can act
and in truth her denunciation of alfred
bennett in the last act of molly is as
fine a piece of work as has been seen on
the legitimate stage a comedienne al-
most a character comedienne this young
woman has a soft pleasing voice and a
droll little trick of screwing up her face
which the average leading lady would
regard with horror since it is fatal to
ones personal beauty but miss lowe is
no mere beauty she has a genuine
sense of humor and while i have a hor-
ror of too solid flesh i think she looked
her loveliest when most plump

  second honors of the performance go
to mrs charles g craig for her charac-
terization of judy mrs craig is of
course the best known delineator of the
old southern mammy on the american
stage and she lends real strength to
molly in what is the chief comedy
role of the little musical play the real
secret of mrs craigs charm and success
is that hers is the real negro character
while her imitators are merely stage
darkies her famous aprons especially
the one with the goslings are much in
evidence in molly while to see her in
the gym rolling with her young missie 
is as they say down home alone worth
the price of admission
an insider



  charles purcell ranks third for his
work as john mo arc

  alfred bennett is played by robert
bentley and his secretary is the smart
alison mcbain the real worth of legiti-
mate artists in musical comedy is further
proven by the excellent work of maude
turner gordon as mrs carter and of
frank kingdon as judge wade

  dot carter the younger sister is im-
personated breezily by gloria goodwin
of piquant face and nimble legs inci-
dentally miss goodwin wore the best
looking clothes in the show all of her
costumes bespeaking an up-to-the-minute
smartness her partner tom morgan
was played by ted lorraine a clever
dancer who scored strongly with a tune-
ful number

  marjorie dunbar pringle boasted the
voice among the women principals but
unfortunately she lacked personality a
decidedly clever bit was given by edgar
norton as a silly-ass englishman st
clair mctabb personally  have never
met an englishman quite as silly as this
gentleman but he was amusing and cre-
ated much favorable comment of the
two dancers each called gladys miss
miller is both clever and pretty which
is also true of the chorus here are some
really pretty girls but on two occasions
their attractiveness was lost because of
the unbecoming costumes the blue and
white costumes with the hats topped with
wings of the same material were de-
cidedly ugly nor were the jockey suits

good the settings were excellent with
the carter house and lawn especially at-
tractive

  we have come to associate sigmund
rombergs name with pleasant melodies
and he has provided a charming score for
the melting of molly the theme
probably called darling is of a haunt-
ing sweetness that places it easily in the
class with his sweetheart of may-
time fame and his mother song ia
her soldier boy also i like molly s
song dear old gown which by the
way was fitted to some clever lyrics
the lodger number reminiscent of
the letter song in the chocolate
soldier-in idea not in melody that is-
was charmingly given by mr purcell and
miss lowe while of more popular
strain is floating down a moonlight
stream with a sort of zither accom-
paniment

  given a real idea to work with the
messrs shubert with the aid of the
romberg music and the clever artists
gathered together have scored a pro-
nounced success the melting of molly
has both rime and reason as well as a
leading lady who can act one who isnt
afraid to sacrifice her personal appear-
ance in the interest of her work it is
a smart show and will be enjoyed bv
smart audiences

  though she is far from being a cat
let us be thankful that molly has so
many lives and that at last she has come
up smiling

princess ajavida

uqne hour in that far long ago

             the emperor came to my door
        flying his enemies by night

i hid him for his wounds were sore

         i hid him in my little house

outside the roses blossomed slow

         in their sweet sheltering he forgot
         empire and friend and foe

         one sun-gold hour within the heart
         of my warm high-walled garden we
         spoke lowly-voiced of little things-

of life that sang in field and tree

of life-and something more-our eyes
met and my heart spoke suddenly

ah there within my garden walls

        heaven had come to me

        they found him when the roses fell
        their foam-sprayed driven horses came
        down through the garden a red yell
        burst like a sudden flame

          he kissed me once and softly said
         beloved what a little thing
         is death and turned with lifted head
         they slew him marvelling

the red blades spilled his life but i
found a last drop within the bowl

i held him in my arms to die

        and his unstricken soul

        found breath to say one word i bent
        he called my name with a last cry

the watching soldiers rose and went

zontal strokes so i smiled a little as
i heard her telling carrie how very in-
differently she had answered him when
he said something that-and then i went
in to see the lady editor

  the editorial room of this magazine
was arranged by a person of exceeding
wisdom what you see is a slender
figure in wonderful blue and a blond
head and a classic profile and blue cur-
tains of the same blue as the dress and
a jar of pink roses feminine-my im
a breezy sort of a person myself and
the effect of that room and that per-
sonality was to make me suddenly con-
scious of my hands and feet she looked
frail and ideal and dreamy and i thought
how hard it must be for her to do any-
thing except sit among cushions of the
right color and dream of some golden
knight she was finishing a letter as i
went in and you know i said i couldnt
make my eyes behave under those cir-
cumstances well i looked and i got
a shock this is a piece from that letter

  please note those compact letters that
well regulated t bar that cautious capi-
tal m observe that the tops of the
letters are angular and that the bottoms
are round the t bar showed me
temper and temperament severely kept
under control the m showed me
somebody who wanted to be selfish but
despised herself for it the compact let-
ters showed me a shrewd level head
but that angularity at top and round-
ness at bottom screamed aloud of a cap-
tious exacting contradictory intensely
subtle and devious mind-the kind of a
mind capable of standing off and calmly
watching the worst agonies of the heart
which beats below it not at all the
dream lady-very much not

  i told her some of that she looked
at me with her impenetrable blue eyes
and i knew that that brain was estimat-
ing me and my talk about handwriting
she was new too since my time

  and then the business manager came
in i knew him years ago and thought
that i thoroughly understood him-hon-
est kindly shrewd far seeing-but it
happened that i had never seen his hand-
writing he sat down at his desk and
wrote for me the first two words that
came into his mind

  i suppose im giving myself away
sadly he remarked with a smile

  you said something i slangily
agreed look at those two words

  do you see it as i did here is the
companion soul to the ardent unselfish
and warm-hearted telephone girl oh
with differences of course time and
experience and mental training have
done a great deal to differentiate the
young girl and the mature man but here
also is one to whom a check-book is
less important than a smile and he s
the business manager and famous for
the way he holds down his job

  how do you do it i asked after
i had explained to him that now i knew
the real inwardness of him  thought
that financial geniuses had to be cold
and rather unfeeling even though they
were kind and honest

  why he asked me

  well-i dont know do you  only
its a way that we get into thinking i-
even i-ahem -who have had those
years and years i mentioned of read-
ing character in handwriting and get-
ting surprised by what i read-even i
find it hard not to expect people to be
what they look like or what their work
appears to make of them but when
you come to think of it why should
the ability to handle money successfully
do away with the ability to love hard or
to be enthusiastic over a sunset  the
business manager blushed clear up into
his hair when i got that far and said
he guessed hed better get to work

  by that time most of the office force
was sauntering into the blue room with
scraps of paper which they implored me
to read

  there are a good many i remarked
with a glance at the clock

  i tell you what you do you write
this all up just as it really happened
said the blond and blue editor and in-
clude all these come on each of you
and give your specimen to the hand-
writing lady

  but they didnt do that they mixed
em i had seen them slyly slipping the
papers from one to the other so i
dont know which is which except that
everybody in the editorial rooms was
there from the president to the office
boy i have no means of knowing
whether it is a man or woman about
whom i am talking bearing in mind
the fact that the personality is no in-
dication whatever of the real elements
of character ill wager therell be a good
deal of surprise and some laughter when
those people read with you what ive
written about them for graphology
h- l s

which is the name by which this science
is known is really a serious and pain-
fully accurate affair it jabs right
through that surface you that you like
so much down to the real you which
may be far less pleasing but is almost
invariably far more interesting it is
not guess-work on my part you know 
i do not use intuition or go into the
silence or employ anything but a fairly
active mind which has been trained to
recognize and estimate the thousands of
variations on the one hundred and fifty
well-known formations used by the oc-
cidental nations in writing

the writer of specimen four is one

to whom extremes of thought feeling
and expression are natural contrast
the loose and breezy t with that firm
and self-possessed t in number two
and note that the k spreads out ex-
pansively observe the upward slant
of the writing here is an individual
with ardor and impatience and lov of
luxury and a quick imagination and a
fair degree of sensuousness and not
enough will power to control all that
to know about how much and what
kind of will power people possess look
at their t bar always it need not
be long or unusually strong but it must
have a certain sweep and power or be
close and compact if it is to indicate
will power and the need for will power
is all the greater of course the more
intricate and interesting the character
so whoever this is whether successful
happy or otherwise he is really in need
of some intensive self-cultivation but
id like to meet that one-im going to
make them tell me who it really is

the writer of the specimen numbered
five is as opposite from number four


the handwriting detective

as it is possible for two human beings
to be this person is fearful of every-
thing and cautious and reserved and
introspective do i have to explain to
any thoughtful reader why i know that
isnt that the instinctive estimate you
would make of this minute tortuous bit
of writing and your instinct as to
handwriting is frequently correct for
graplioiogv is based upon a long long
line of instinctive reasonings reduced to
a system why away hack in 
camillo baldo--but you dont want to
hear that do you anyway there are
a lot of famous names among the grapho-
logists of the centuries since camillo
nr began the serious investigation as
to the meaning of the utter individuality
of every individuals hsl to return
to the specimen anybody who writes
that little cramped hand needs to get
ou in the world and breathe some ne
ar he needs to learn to laugh-no hu-
mor ii this specimen at all on the other
and quite obviously without even
a sucgesticsi front lue science of grapho-
jogv there is he capacity for taking m-
inite pains if to that element more
courage and initiative were added- the
character of this writer would promise
a good deal for work requiring dose and
accurate attention

xumber six nice grl that now

i m guessing tor icre s no such thing
as telling sex in handwriting i know
of no belter argument for the comp ete
equality of the mafe and female than this
ooe thag-stripped down to the reveal-
ing ciwrographr men and women are not
marked by a siagle dsssngiztshing marie
jest the jsmc i think shes a nice girl
there is sccsetimes a -ssssxthjasf about
a ui ci haadwrmng wh ruggesss thzi
we xather vagadv call iesiaine
and a person wtjo fcas examined-oh

or of specimens can

sometimes be right in finding that some-
thing aside from that however the
character as revealed would tit any
young person of normal instinct good
heart and fair brain development as
for its being a youthful hand of thit
at least i can be sure after middle
age is reached it is very difficult to ay
approximately bow old a writer is ive
known people of eighty who wrote as
firm a hand as those of fty-but youth-
fulness shows ill the unformed nature of
the letters just as it shows in the un-
formed features of the face in num-
ber six there is too much imagination
and too much lack of forcctulncss but
that is true of all nice young people
its a good fault

  if you want to see the evidences of
maturity in a hand which has some re-
semblance to number six look at num-
ber seven the difference is plain

enough anybody can see it but it is
almost impossible to describe it is like
the very slight dn erences which exist
between the face of a boy of twenty
and that of a man of thirty there
are no lines as later in hie no real
char ge that can be seized upon aad yet
-exactly wefl here is a person too
t-ith imagination ard some lack of force-
fr-ness-hat that is a more serious fault
here than it is in number six it is
in need of instant correction-or rather
of instant attention the correction will
take a kmg time each of these people

and tender way  vch makes one cd

  number eight has some family re-
semblance to six and seven which is
the reason i put it in here to show you
how carefully a graphologist must judge

the resemblance is superficial note
that there are no similar letter forma-
ations this particular specimen is a
baffling one and i have a suspicion that
the personality is one of much reserve
not that personality is accurately re-
flected in writing but that element of
being like sex is sometimes hinted at
as it were to an experienced eye note
the suave attenuated small letters which
are perfectly distinct and yet have their
outlines cut down to the utmost sim-
plicity people who use that kind of a
hand are more highly developed men-
tally than they are physically or spiritual-
ly not that any lack of physical health
is indicated but that the writers inter-
ests are not fixed upon matters which
concern only the body neither is the
spiritual nature greatly encouraged to
function this is a person of clear ac-
curate rapid thinking power who is not
credulous who is what is known as hard
headed and who has very clearly de-
fined ideas and convictions an inter-
esting personality i am sure but not
especially magnetic except upon a de-
liberate intention of being so or on those
rare occasions when the emotions are
stirred that there is a capacity for
deep and serious affection is indicated
by the sloping of the writing rightward
and you can see that this specimen is
inclined very sharply

  speaking of affection if you want to
know how loving your sweetheart is look
at this matter of which way his hand-
writing leans roughly speaking we
may estimate that the upright hand rep-
resents the zero mark in emotionalism
from which each slight deviation right-
ward marks a step onward handwrit-

ing which all but lies down upon the
line represents the limit-the hysterical
and neurotic

an illustration of this unemotional
type is found in number nine not

 l-

you will observe that the handwriting
is really placed at the zero mark but
that the effect of the writing makes it
seem upright this effect is partly due
to the formation of the letters which
are plain and unobtrusive this person
lacks imagination note the closeness of
the dot of i to the letter which is a
sure sign of a practical and literal mind
this writer does not believe in fairies
you may be sure-in fact doesnt be-
lieve in much of anything which cannot
be demonstrated in words of few syl-
lables people of this type are ver
useful to the world it is they who keep
us sane and practical and who provide
us with steady and reliable and con-
scientious workers

i dont know about number tui-

really i dont once in a while an hon-
est graphologist comes across a speci-
men either intentionally disguised or
written when the hand was very tired
or in sickness or in a fit of rage which
it is almost impossible to decipher this
is one of those if i read the speci-
men the way surface indications point
id say-inconstant uncertain temper
disposition to be moody some imagina-
tion a dry sort of humor affections in-
tense but unreliable-but i have a feel-
ing that the specimen has been doped
maybe not but if not then it is a most
unusual specimen indeed and i should
need a hundred or so more words before
i should be willing to stand by my
diagnosis	


the handwriting detective

after struggling with that it is a re-
lief to turn to number eleven here

if you please is ti thoroughly consistent
character notice that all the letter
formations are similar in type that the
t bar is nicely adjusted to the relative
strength and size of the letter that the
size of the capital is in proportion-
and a lot of other things which you can
see if you look carefully  now ill
read that character for you and you
can guess pretty easily how its done by
this time  estimate this person as hav-
ing passed into mature years-not neces-
sarily over forty mind you-for grapho-
logy does not recognize mere years it
merely recognizes facts and you know
perfectly well that some people are old
at forty and some are still quite young
but all have passed beyond the stage
where they are likely to change greatly
in temperament well this person will
assuredly not change whether man or
woman the ideals the attitude of mind
the tastes the emotions are all firmly
outlined the joining of the words
shows a mind which is not only logical
in its operations but which forces the
impress of its conclusions upon the heart
and soul many people you know can
think accurately and see very clearly a

chain of reasoning but are quite power-
less to rule themselves thereby this
persons mind does that ruling well but
it could not have been always so there
are evidences of impetuosity and illy
governed impatience and of pride and
of passions now overcome

  the last specimen you will notice
has a more pronounced pen pressure
than any of the others this one fact

is indicative of a keen interest in the
material and physical world but in ad-
dition to that we have the almost up-
right writing the heavily formed letters
and the inflated loops on the letters all
of which show a nature which is empha-
tically of this world id say that it
would be a matter of prime importance
to this person as to whether a steak were
tender or not that the possession of
money would confer the greatest hap-
piness and next to that the possession
of health id expect this person to be
righteous and decent but o have only
a perfunctory interest in religion-and
id be sure that he-there im guessing
again-because maybe this is that sweet
madonna faced girl that i particularly
noticed you never can tell em by
howr they look you see-but as to how
they write-thats a different matter

          graphological reading if the sender does not desire

it was warm and still under uie trees
the rude ill-defined trail wound
steadily upward through virgin for-
est the girl quickened the pace of her
horse she was tired of the monotony
of the pine woods and was anxious to
get to the open crest of the foothills
of the coast range presenuy she reached
her high goal and with a sigh of relief
drew rein dismounted and walked for-
ward to the brink of the hill she
stopped on the highest point and sur-
veyed the enchanting prospect as she had
often done silently she reveled in its
color she noted again with keen pleas-
ure the green of the mighty forest the
silver of the shallow river the gold of
the bordering sand and far beyond all
the deep blue of the tossing sea the
scene lacked nothing but life and as she
stared life came

  the primeval loneliness was disturbed
by human figures though they were
far beneath her she could see them quite
easily with the naked eye she made out
six men coming from the forest and
moving down the clearing on the brink
of the precipice overlooking the river
one obviously was a white man she
could not place the others their brown
heads were covered with brilliant hued
caps they wore short gaudy jack-
ets and shorter trousers their brown
feet and legs were bare and around each

mans middle a broad and glistening sash
of many colors was twisted she had
never seen a malay she knew nothing
ot the sarong which was his distinctive
girdle but that the men were foreign
and semi-savage she could not doubt

  she fixed her gaze upon them she
had never before seen a soul there as
far as she knew that lonely shore that
shallow river were unsettled and un-
visited her curiosity was aroused by
their unexpected presence and she sur-
veyed them with a vivid and curious
interest she was conscious of a vague
feeling of resentment as if these stran-
gers had suddenly profaned a shrine of
her own though she could lay claim to
no proprietorship in that strip of no
mans land along the shore

  suddenly her interest quickened into
an intensity of horror battle and mur-
der and sudden death invaded the peace-
ful solitude with appalling abruptness
she stood stunned for a second and then
leaning forward screamed half in terror
half in warning her voice was lost
in the intervening distance her breath
coming short her heart beating furiously
as the battle was waged below her she
could only stand and stare an uncon-
scious spectator judge and as it hap-
pened in the end guerdon of the con-
flict

  for one instant the white mans long
continued watchfulness was abated of
that solitary moment of faltering vigi-

lance po-yanpen took prompt advan-
tage his knife flashed in the sunlight
as he leaped at the back of his master
happily fortune in complaisant mood
overlooked the lapse of the american
as he struck at the engineer the malay
tripped and fell  such was the force
behind the blow that the assailant unable
to recover himself pitched down at the
others feet his curved kris burying it-
self in the earth

  the american sensed his danger in-
stantly he turned and kicked the half-
risen po-yanpen with such violence that
he drove the malays body over the cliff
and into the river below at the same
time he whipped out his revolver and
fired point blank at the other four com-
ing at him he missed wan-aman to
whom po-yanpens leadership had fall-
en hut he accounted for the next man
who went down with a bullet in his
brain before he could fire again wan-
aman and the other two were upon him
his revolver was knocked from his hand
and followed po-yanpens body down
the cliff wan-aman cut him deep in
the shoulder the fourth malay struck
him over the head with a heavy ax
while the last one darted in from the
side seeking an opportunity to use his
short dagger

  thus menaced on all sides though he
had accounted for two of his mutinous
and murderous crew and was weapon-
less before the other three the engineer
resorted to the offensive characteristic
of his temper and race before the man
with the dagger could deliver a second
cut the engineer felled him with a ter-
rific blow of his fist and then sustain-
ing a second stab from the kris the
white man leaped at wan-aman the
now thoroughly frightened malay strove
to grapple with him but the american
lifted him up and by a wrestlers trick
loosening his grip hurled him senseless
to the rocks the american then picked
up wan amans kris and made for the
only one of the quintette of villains still

upon his feet this fellow was made
of sterner stuff he braced himself for
the shock and met it bravely two
knives flashed in the air and the ring
of blade on blade penetrated the dull
ear of the malay who had been knocked
down he grasped the american by the
heel and the three men went down to-
gether and rolled on the earth confused-
ly fighting and striking

  the woman on the high hill saw all
this clearly from thefirst leap of the
striking traitor against which she strove
to warn the man of her race with that
futile cry to the last struggle in that
confused melee she had missed nothing
silent still she watched with fixed look
the white man rise triumphant at last
only to stagger and crash down ap-
parently helpless and lie still by the
side of the men he had conquered against
such odds

  so sudden had been the attack so
swift the battle that only the presence
of the bodies on the clearing convinced
her of the reality of the same when
it was over she could have cried aloud

  for a moment or two she considered
what to do her instinct was to fly
to ride back to her camp and bring help
but she discarded that idea as soon as
it was formed for one thing it would
take time the white man had been
alive a moment since he might be alive
now if she waited he might die she
must go to him

  she stared again but could detect no
movement among the slain they were
all apparently dead or dying with in-
tent look she searched wood and bank
and shore no others appeared she
had she thought no interruptions to fear
she would go down to give what as-
sistance she could to find out what it
was all about she turned called to
her horse mounted and rode rapidly
down the mountain side through the
trees picking her way skilfully over the
trailless declivities and through the
woods

  when the white man got the mastery
over the two remaining villains and
wresting the kris from the last survivor
held him down with one hand while he
thrust the malay through the heart he
was utterly unconscious of his wounds
his weakness his loss of blood it was
not till the engineer got to his feet that
he realized his helplessness he took
a step or two brushing the blood from
his eyes and then fell he summoned
all his resolution as he went down and
barely managed to keep from fainting
he lay still for a moment suffering
agonies and then nerved himself for a
final effort he got to his hands and
knees bound his handkerchief about his
head and disregarding the other
wounds sufficiently serious to have in-
capacitated a less resolute man he set
himself to getting rid of the bodies of
the four malays with incredible effort
and slowly with long pauses he managed
to roll them off the cliff and into the
river he knew he had come in at flood
tide and that a sufficient time had elapsed
for the tide to have turned so that the
bodies would be carried out to sea with
the river current and the ocean ebb he
did not want any dead men about in
case he should be rescued their bodies
might give rise to awkward questions

  his painful and wellnigh impossible
task accomplished he sought to go down
to the brink of the river where his ves-
sel a square-rigged decked-over ma-
layan kapal was hidden in the trees that
bordered a little creek but that was
beyond him he realized that he could
scarcely expect succor on that lonely
coast-its loneliness having recommended
it as his landing place-and that if he
were to get help he must go for it
but further progress was impossible
he tried to crawl along the cliff toward
the descent up which he had come but
his slow advance soon stopped despite
his iron determination strength of body
mind and will all gave way at once and
he pitched down burying his face in the

earth this time it appeared that he
was out for good

  he was conscious of nothing he did
not hear the footfalls of a horse crash-
ing through the undergrowth treading
down fallen branches even the cessa-
tion of sound as the horse was stopped
made no impression upon him he did
not know that the girl white faced but
resolute had dismounted and had drawn
her pistol a light automatic her guide
had insisted upon her carrying every-
where with her other hand she took
the flask of whisky also a requisite in-
sisted upon from the pocket of her jack-
et and thus doubly armed stepped for-
ward

  she could see him clearly as she came
through the underbrush at the first
sight of the open she stopped amazed
had she not seen six men engaged in
deadly struggle yet there was but one
before her where were the others

  she could not answer the question
nor did it trouble her long she noted
that the one body left was that of the
white man naturally her sympathies
were all with him he was of her race
he had been the subject of a cowardly
attack and he had contended triumph-
antly against overwhelming odds these
were reasons enough

  with sudden fear she ran toward him
bent down and by exerting all the
strength of her vigorous young arms
turned him onto his back as she
dropped her unnecessary weapon she
lifted his head and put the flask to his
lips then she took a good look at him
his face was that of a young man the
full dark beard did not disguise its
rugged strength his lips were white
his face lined and bronzed by toil and
exposure so that she deemed hin older
than he would have appeared under dif-
ferent circumstances his hair was mat-
ted with blood which had also run down
his cheeks and into his beard and which
was still flowing her hands as she
supported his shoulder came in contai

with more blood at which she shud-
dered but did not release her hold

  obviously he was in desperate case
she managed to force a few drops of
liquor between his teeth whereat he
opened his eyes a moment lifted his
head a little and muttered between his
clenched teeth words which she caught
bending eagerly to listen

  that damned-po-yanpen-betrayed
-water-

  then his eyes closed again and his
head fell back upon her arm she laid
him down gently picked up her stetson
hat and ran down the declivity toward
the river fortunately she soon came
upon a little spring trickling from the
rocks she was so intent upon her pur-
pose that she did not note certain dark
objects being swept out to sea by the cur-
rent she filled the hat which held water
perfectly so close was its textnre and
ran back to the unconscious figure then
she paused uncertainly she had no first-
aid packet or other material for dress-
ings with her her hesitation was but
momentary she tore off the riding
jacket and then took off her linen waist
she did not stop to cover her bare arms
and shoulders with the coat but set im-
mediately to wash and bandage the mans
wounds especially tbose in his head and
shoulders

  she was rewarded by a complete re-
turn to consciousness as she stanched
the flow of blood and ministered to him
she was so busy over him that at first
she did not notice his prolonged stare
when she became aware of it she real-
ized her appearance and with a blush
almost as crimson as the blood stains on
the bandages she laid his head down and
resumed her jacket buttoning it up to
her throat then she spoke to him

  i saw it all she began you were
splendid how do you feel now 

  the man had not ceased to stare he
could find no words at first the woman
gave him another swallow of water and
whisky and then he spoke

  are you angel or- he whispered
brokenly in bewilderment

only a woman what became of
those men why did they attack you
but the man closed his lips and made
no answer the woman waited a mo-
ment and then went on

  	 ou can tell me all about it when
you feel better now  am going to my
camp to get help for you are you
afraid to stay here alone

  the man smiled faintly

  pm afraid of nothing-after all ive
gone through he answered you
see- then his lips closed again

  exactly said the woman ill
drag you under the shade of this tree
leave you this flask and this automatic
and be back in two hours with horses
a wagon or a litter and help-

  the flask only keep your gun you
might need it

 why are there any more of
those- she began apprehensively but
he cut her short

  so far as i know-you and i are
the only living beings-in this world
he said

  she nodded and then with an exhibi-
tion of strength surprising in one of her
somewhat slight build she dragged him
into the shade of the nearest trees and
made him comfortable as she rose to
go he feebly detained her

  you have-have saved my life-
doubtless your hand he said when she
gave it he pressed it to his lips i may
not be here when you come back and
that is for-thank you and-good-by
she completely misunderstood him
she looked at him anxiously indeed as
she withdrew her hand and turned away

  youll be all right ill hurry back
she said keep up your courage

  he watched her mount and ride off
when he lost sight of her he listened
till all sound of her going died away
no one must find him there he must
disappear as completely as the malays
had though not in the same way
cyrus townsend brady



  he was a strong man and a heavy
draft from the well-filled flask gave him
a certain temporary vigor her bandag-
ing had been well done the flow of
blood was stopped he did not try to
walk he must husband his strength
but he could crawl slowly he made his
way to the shore she had said two
hours he must make it in one at
all hazards he must be away before she
returned and she would return quicker
than she had promised instinctively he
realized she was that kind of a girl

  he had lost count of time when he
reached the side of the boat in the creek
there lay his hardest task he had to
lift himself up and scramble aboard he
had scarcely strength to cast off the
mooring how he managed to hoist a
scrap of canvas he could never tell the
current and the ebb both acted for him
the boat drifted out of the creek and
was carried over the bar the wind
caught the rag of sail and in a few mo-
ments the little vessel was rising and fall-
ing in the gentle waves of the mighty sea
then and not till then did he faint dead
away he lay on the deck in a state of
coma from which at first even the sud-
den deluge of rain which came squall-
like across the hills toward the ocean did
not arouse him

  in less than an hour and half the girl
was back with her were some of the
men guides packers and servants from
her camp in the woods the promised
wagon was waiting on the nearest road
the men bore a rude litter hastily im-
provised the woman led them un-
erringly to the clearing

  no one was there the oldest guide
looked at the woman inquiringly and a
little incredulously she could give no
explanation she was as much bewil-
dered as the others

  air you sure you seen it all jes as
you tole us miss he asked searchingly

  of course answered the girl do
you think me a child i saw i tell you
and you know mv waist was gone

  you sartiniy couldnt a dremp that
away answered one of the others

  i didnt look about search he
may have crawled away- she began

  but the guide stopped her

  remember that squall o rain that
come down on us on the trail it fell
here too an washed out every sign
cant follow no trails now miss

  it hasnt washed out this answered
the girl plucking po-yanpens kris from
the ground and holding it up triumph-
antly

  aint never seed no knife like that a-
one said the old frontiersman glancing
at it then examining it critically he
passed it on to others equally ignorant

  but i guess you did see something
he continued we better take a good
look around

  a search iastin for hours revealed
nothing further but the woman would
not give it up until the approach of night
made it necessary to return to her camp
she rode off full of the mystery and but
for the strange curved knife which she
carried thinking that she might have
imagined it all

  three days later the big freighter
cambodia bound out from seattle for
yokohama via honolulu picked up a
wounded delirious castaway alone on a
small dismasted and water-logged boat
which the experienced among her of-
ficers decided had been originally a large
square-rigged malayan proa or prau
popularly known as a kapal there was
no water and no food in the boat noth-
ing of value in fact and the man in his
fevered condition could give no coherent
or intelligible account of himself

  from his ravings they could gather
nothing definite he babbled of angels
and devils and of each without rhyme or
reason

  barbara lemoyne was not alone in
her realization of longfields peculi
tractiveness to a handsome fa


white treasure

graceful person were added brilliant wit
and an irreproachable manner the de-
tails sound effeminate but there was no
lack of strength and power about the
man he was an up-to-date admirable
crichton who bore himself so easily
and was so unconscious of his qualifica-
tions that this perfection did not irritate
women liked him better than men did
perhaps men would have been more
strongly drawn to him if he had not so
obviously preferred womenkind there
was a little mystery about him despite his
frankness which women sensed vaguely
to the enhancement of his attractiveness

  longfield had come to san francisco
with unexceptionable letters and had
been received everywhere with all
doors open he had chosen to enter bar-
bara lemoynes more frequently than
any other longfield was sometimes ac-
cused of being too entirely regulated too
conventional barbara lemoyne was
different and the opposite attracted
although her fine face was lacking in
some of the attributes of classic beauty
it was none the less charming she just
escaped the perfection in which long-
field who realized it all very well
reveled her mind was as good as his
but again different she rejoiced in the
odd the unusual possessed of sufficient
means to gratify her own inclinations
she had the courage to gratify them one
of her friends a crusty old bachelor had
carved on the chimney breast of his
hunting lodge these words

  this is my house here  do what i
damn please

  the spirit of the rude phrase was her
own she did much as she pleased with
life happily a certain native american
rectitude kept her from depths others
might have sounded and presently so-
ciety which had at first marveled and
then frowned and next fought came to
accept her she became the fashion but
without imitators she lived her life and
society was glad to share it on her own
terms when shr permitted that privilege

she was a perfect representative of the
imperfect that is to say the unconven-
tional why she chose so to be she never
explained mystery in a woman is at
first attractive although it tends to be-
come unbearable

  longfields experience with women
had been great and varied but amid the
outward differences he had discovered a
rooted sameness that barbara le-
moyne was really different inwardly
and spiritually different appealed to him
-not the spiritual side longfield cared
little about that and despite himself he
loved her

  he had loved her from the moment he
came upon her in the north woods
neither expecting the other she was
camping there for pleasure seeking in
the wildness escape from convention
which however much she disdained it
she could not continually flout he was
seeking-well certainly not a woman
the unexpected meeting added piquancy
to the situation

  when he returned to san francisco he
awaited her coming with an eagerness he
had never before experienced though he
had waited for many women in different
parts of the world and not a few had
waited for him he had presented his
letters had called properly and encour-
aged by her welcome he had become an
habitue of her domicile he would not
have believed it possible that he could
care so much for anyone but he could
not be sure that she returned his passion

  as for her she found herself wonder-
ing just how great was his appeal did
she care as he did could she care  did
she wish to  she hesitated and was not
lost because of her incertitude she de-
liberated and could come to no conclu-
sion in some things she was the most
practical of her sex whence came long-
field from his conversation he had
been everywhere and therefore that gave
her no clue what was he doing in san
francisco for the matter of that what
had he been doing up in the north
cyrus townsend brady



woods when that equally unexpected
meeting took place why did he linger
on her frequent visitor

  a less clear sighted person would have
answered that she was the polestar of
his attraction but although she was too
much a woman not to realize his grow-
ing passion she knew it was not that
alone at times he thought it was only
she but he was aroused from that tem-
porary self-deception by the arrival of
keene

  it was weeks after he had been landed
by the cambodia at honolulu for hos-
pital treatment that christopher keene
set foot in san francisco he was com-
pletely recovered from his wounds no
scar was visible the deep cut on the
head was concealed by his hair he had
shaved off his mustache and beard
some of the signs of exposure and hard-
ship which barbara had noticed had dis-
appeared the long weeks in the hos-
pital had cleared his complexion there
were some things written in his face
which would never be erased but much
of his youth had returned

  when longfield and keene stood side
by side it would be difficult to secure a
greater contrast in no way was keene
handsome he did not barely escape it
like barbara lemoyne he had no claim
to it whatever his features were harsh
he was even a little forbidding in his
ruggedness but he was strong clear-
eyed firm mouthed he was good to
look at because one could see courage
and determination and honesty in his
personality there was no apparent
mystery about him

  no mystery certainly no outward
and visible one-yet within the man
was a prey to anxiety and disappoint-
ment so great as to be almost unbearable
yet such was his control that no out-
ward evidence of the inward struggle
was visible

  longfield possessed that genius for re-
pression also but with a difference
longfield buried his secrets whatever

they were as a blade is sheathed in vel-
vet keene hid his under a granite rock
one saw instinctively that the velvet hid
something the granite rock only lay
where it had been cast by nature and
gave no sign of what it hid or even
that it hid anything

  as it happened the secrets of both
men concerned the same thing though
they knew it not they were engaged upon
the same quest and in the pursuit of it
they were to come in contact with the
same woman but barbara le moyne
was quite unconscious of that fact
longfield had a great advantage for
when she at last met keene she sup-
posed she had never before seen him
yet she was vaguely conscious that he
reminded her of something or somebody
the reminder was so faint however
that she presently forgot it

 keene was seeking a woman - a
woman he did not know whose name he
had never heard a woman whom he felt
sure he could not recognize even should
he find her that she had been at one
time on the pacific coast that she was
young and efficient that she had the
whitest neck and arms that she had
helped him-these made up the totality
of his recollection not much on which
to build a hope few facts on which to
base a search yet he must find her

  he did not love her oh no but
through her and through her alone
could he achieve a certain design to
which he had given himself wholeheart-
edly in the attempt to bring about that
ideal he had suffered and struggled
amazingly he had performed the in-
credible through difficulties inexpres-
sible over unknown lands and across
trackless seas with a single comrade of
his race he had reached his goal step
after step of the journey had been
marked with the blood of men he had
lost his best friend on the way and
now failing the discovery of the woman
or a miracle he was halted on the verire
of success miracles did not happen in


white treasure

keenes hard adventurous career so
that to find the woman was his only re-
course unwittingly she had his secret
whether she concealed it in scabbard or
under rock he must have it

  for keene had forgotten where it was
his malays had attacked him that
blow on the head yiad done just that
nothing more everything else was clear
to him he could trace the whole ter-
rible journey every desperate en-
deavor every infinite hazard every ob-
stacle natural and human was etched
upon his brain he knew how when the
russian revolution occurred he and
young seymour had fled from baku
where he represented a great american
corporation he recalled the idea that
had come to him as he drove his motor-
boat across the wind-lashed waters of the
caspian he knew how with seymours
devoted backing he had fought with the
rude miners of the urals matching his
cunning and wit and strength against
theirs

  he could vividly recall the incredible
route the germans who had gotten wind
of his design just too late had forced
him to take by closing to him the ordi-
nary routes it would have been com-
paratively easy to have taken the trans-
siberian railway to vladivostok but
that way was barred by the german in-
fluence he laughed as he thought how
he had outwitted them how he had
packed his precious cargo across the
mountains down the sea over the deso-
late plateau of turkestan via the ancient
oxus river and into china over the
fearful horrors of the baraghil pass

  he remembered how he had toiled up
the historic indus with an ever-changing
set of bearers spurred to terrific feats of
progress in the wild himalayas by the
stern admonition and desperate energy of
their master man after man had died
the way he had come was blazed with
corpses but lie had kept on and yet
by ach body bleaching in the sun or
freezing amid the snow lay a weight of

precious cargo to bring which no price
had been too great to pay what he had
perforce left behind had been invaluable
but what he managed to carry on was
enough

  from the indus he had crossed the
mountains by ways never before trod of
men until he reached the head waters of
the sacred brahmaputra from there
on his progress had been easier he rec-
ollected the hot feverish crawl along the
east shores of the bay of bengal the
crossing of the malay peninsula the
careful avoidance everywhere of euro-
peans he had escaped again and again
from the network of spies and agents of
germany who had been warned that he
had been held back from the trans-siber-
ian railway and that he must eventually
arrive somewhere on the indian ocean
or the pacific littoral they had picked
up his trail only to lose it and him when
he embarked for that long voyage across
the pacific from the perils of which even
a spirit as hardy as that of drake or ma-
gellan might have shrunk he had in
default of anything else decked over and
rebuilt a malay kapal for the cruise-a
vessel to make a real sailor laugh yet it
had served

  his design was temporarily to conceal
his treasure somewhere on the shore to
take his malay crew down to san fran-
cisco ship them back to singapore and
then choose his own time and his own
way to dispose of it

  on that voyage the greatest of calami-
ties had befallen him young seymour
so brave so gallant so faithful had at
last succumbed to the strains and the
hardships that had almost broken down
the rugged keene himself keene re-
membered how they had buried the
young man in the fog into which they
had run a few days sail from the pacific
coast he had said what prayers he
could remember and improvise as he
launched into the dull gray sea the body
of his faithful friend and fellow-work-
man in the great adventure while the
         cyrus townsend brady	

malays stood about watchful and silent

  the fog had prevented him from get-
ting an observation before he made that
landing he did not know upon what
part of the shore his keel had grated
and then came the mutiny the battle on
the river bank po-yanpen and wan-
amari taking advantage of his natural
feeling of elation at the success of the
achievement and the consequent failure
of that eternal vigilance which is not only
the price of success in high adventure
but of life also had struck him down
seymour had not been there to divide
the watch

  he remembered everything up to the
moment in which the cupidity of the
semi-savages who only reasoned that
what had been hidden with such care
must be valuable had struck with sudden
desperation to secure it after that he
could recall only a ministering woman
but the place of it all had gone from him
utterly rack his brains as he might
nothing but her presence came to him
a face seen dimly unrecognizable a
white neck two white arms a kissed
palm-god it was maddening she
mnst be found she must tell him she
must show him the way

ill

  although keene had not lived in san
francisco for years he had kept up his
membership in the scholastic gub most
of the men he had knowrn in former
days were gone but some remained and
naturally he found there his only ac-
quaintances he made the club his home
while he replenished his shattered fi-
nances from some early and fortunate
investments and decided upon his next
move he considered and discarded
many plans and he rapidly regained his
former health and energy finally he
decided either to charter a launch and go
up the coast examining every inlet or
river mouth in the hope that one of them
would quicken his recollection or to go

inland search for her camp and take his
departure from it certainly women
such as she would be rare aud perhaps
not so difficult of discovery he had an
indefinable feeling that she was no rude
daughter of the wilds but the educated
refined product of the city for that
reason he went about san francisco con-
stantly on the alert scrutining every
woman with his somewhat bold and very
direct glance in the hope that happy
chance might provide him with a clue
and of course in vain the long arm of
coincidence did not stretch that far he
met no one who in the least degree sug-
gested her

  and he was in a great hurrr too
time was vit he could not wait his
countrys need and his own desire for
active service which few could render
better than he made every hour of the
utmost importance

  longfield also was in a hurry he
was on the point of leaving san fran-
cisco despite the rather halting progress
of his love altair because of the press-
ing nature of his business he did not
wish to go he had an energetic and
capable mans horror of loose ends he
liked to finish every task and with bar-
bara lemoyne still unwon that endeavor
could in no way be considered completed
but his superiors were imperative after
all a little absence might be useful in
enabling him to decide upon the depth
and permanence of his feelings his
was a hazardous profession for all its
seeming quiet but if he loved her after
he parted from her he would manage
somehow to come back he had already
done good service to his cause he would
be entitled to some consideration his
trunks were packed he was ready to
make his farewells to her and go when
he met keene at the club that meet-
ing and a cablegram he had just received
changed his plans

  he had been properly introduced 
the scholastic club and had mad fanv
friends as it happened until cable

came he had never met or even seeu
keene who kept mainly to himself af-
ter the wire which he carefully burned
after he had read it longfield went out
of his way to seek the man

  it was not difficult to strike up an ac-
quaintance one morning keene missed
the check that should have come with
his order and spoke to one of the pass-
ing graybeards who had replaced
younger servants called to the front
boy bring me the chit

  longfield was sitting near reading
and covertly watching tlie slightly un-
familiar word gave him an opening he
rose and approached the engineer

  pardon me he said but that form
of address sounds good to me and i
take the liberty of introducing myself
my name is longfield-

  keene glanced at him quickly was at-
tracted by the engaging frankness of the
man and seeing no reason for withhold-
ing the information answered

 my name is keene christopher
keene

  and youve lived in the east

  so many years that im almost a
stranger at home

  my case exactly though i have met
so many charming people since i came
west that it is hardly fair to say i am
a stranger ive lived in the east too-
and by the east both men knew that
new york was not meant but the great
oriental land of mystery and charm
across the pacific it does me good to
meet some one who knows whats out
there did you come across recently
on the jast t k k boat was the
answer which was quite true though of
course she had only picked up keene at
honolulu and you how long
since-

  i think it was about six months ago
that i left the over-seas club at hong-
kong interrupted longfield

  i know the over-seas well said
keene in turn and reminiscing over
common acquaintances and common ex-

periences the two men spent half a
morning together they were ill-sorted
physically yet perhaps because of their
very difference they got along amazing-
ly as well as any two men each re-
solved upon maintaining an impene-
trable reserve upon certain matters
could get along it is significant that
most of the advances came from long-
field who used every effort and every
art to ingratiate himself with the other

  miss lemoyne found longfield un-
usually agreeable about this time there
was an air of excitement about him a
foreshadowing of some coming triumph
which increased her interest in him she
began to consider him seriously yet
really save in so far as making the ac-
quaintance of keene was involved lie
had made little real progress for
keene made no attempt to get at long-
fields secret did not apparently know
or if he knew care whether longfield
had a secret or not and while he
talked freely of his own career and ad-
ventures and exchanged all sorts of
reminiscences with his new and agree-
able friend keene easily avoided com-
mitting himself as to the more recent
episodes of his career and his present
pressing affairs

  for one thing certain little happenings
had given keene pause in the acquaint-
anship which had been verging on in-
timacy one morning one of the scho-
lastics attendants had committed some
venial fault of service longfields eyes
had suddenly flashed with passion he
had half risen from his chair in ill re-
strained iury when he caught keenes sur-
prised glance his face had smoothed
at once and he had passed off the dere-
liction with some pleasant pardoning
word  and then the conversation had
flowed on but keene had seen and he
could not forget men who lived as he
did in momentary peril are accustomed
to note even trifles that was the be-
ginning of his suspicion of long-
field

she fjcttd herselt strangely reluctant to

  at any -ate she asked tor ttnae she
tom him that she was giving a dinner to

if she desired or decided to enter into it
with that he had to be content
