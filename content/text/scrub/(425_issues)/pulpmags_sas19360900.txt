the dragon
        she came from high society and she should
        have known she had no business associating
        with a gorilla like wild bill clanton how-
        ever the job she wanted done was plain
        burglary and her code of honor wouldnt
        let her turn thief
he girl who storm- her lines were supple and rounded with
ed the back room
of the purple drag-
on bar where wild
bill clanton sat sip-
ping a whiskey-and-
soda looked out of
place in that dive she advertised her
place in the social register from her in-
solently tilted beret to her high french
heels she was tall and slender but all
marianne had a brief
view of an arc of
gleaming steel
melting curves that would make any
mans blood run faster just now her
purplish eyes flashed and her pertly-
tilted breasts swelled stormily

of kao tsu
  you she accused clanton are a
thief a liar and a rat
  so what he retorted unimpressed
as he poured another drink
  why you low-lifed- her refine-
ment skidded a trifle in her resentment
and she began sketching his genealogy
with language she never learned in the
uw sam
waimil

spicy-adventure stories
junior league he interrupted her per-
emptorily
  now you hold on some things no-
body can call me not even a lady sit
down and cool off before somethin un-
pleasant happens to you
  she wilted at the threat and drooped
into the chair opposite him
  this she said bitterly is what i
get for associating with a gorilla like
you why i do it i dont know
  i know he retorted because you
wanted shareef ahmeds ivory dragon
and i was the only man who could get it
for you
  yes you were there was rancor
in her tone and her basilisk glare made
him uneasy you never could tell about
these society dames if she yanked a
knife out of her garter he meant to smack
her down
  but she had no knife in her garter
as he could tell when she crossed her
silk-clad legs with the regal indifference
of a true aristocrat she twitched down
her skirt an inch or so but not before
he had a glimpse of white skin that made
the blood boil to his head her in-
difference to his emotions was madden-
ing
  probably it had never occurred to old
man allisons pampered daughter mari-
anne that a man on clantons social plane
would even think of making a pass at
her but lie had to clench his hands to
keep them off of her
  whats eatin you he demanded
ttor answer she produced something
from her handbag and smacked it
down accusingly before him it was a
small pot-bellied ivory dragon exquis-
itely carved and yellowed with age
  its a fake she declared
  its the one ram lai stole from
shareef ahmed he asserted
  its a fake she contended moodily
either youve gyped me or that babu
you hired to do the job has or ahmeds
fooled us all
  well what of it  he asked all
you want it for is to show to your
society friends back in the united states
and brag about it bein a rare antique
they wont know the difference
  some of them will she answered
lighting a cigarette with an injured air
the collection of oriental antiques is
a great hobby in my set its been a
game to see who could get the rarest
relic by fair means or foul betty el-
ston got hold of a priceless ming vase
in canton and shes gloated over the rest
of us until ive wanted to kick her little
-well anyway i heard about the kao
tsu dragon in san francisco and i came
all the way to singapore to get it it
dates from the early han dynasty and
its the only one of its kind in the world
i knew ahmed wouldnt sell it so i hired
you to have it stolen for me
  clanton picked up the yellowed figure
and turned it about
  i dunno he mused ram lai got
into ahmeds house and swiped this
hes the slickest thief on the peninsula
but if its the wrong one he might be
afraid to risk another try ahmeds bad
business
  but hes been paid and it isnt the
right dragon  she snapped what kind
of a man would he be to take money
under false pretences
 hire a thief and then squawk if he
gyps yon he mocked her but keep
your shirt on im a man of mv word
anyway ive taken your dough and i
aim to deliver the goods ram lais so
scared of ahmed hes hidin in an old
warehouse down on the waterfront
maybe he just got the wrong dragon by
mistake or he may be boldin out on
the dragon of kao tsu

tis for more dough you leave this thing
with me and tonight ill go down there
and talk to him if hes on the level
maybe hell try again if hes tryin to
put somethin over well well see
im going with you she decided
i dont trust either of you
  its no place for a white woman
he warned her
   she tilted a scornful nose
  i can take care of myself mister
clanton-otherwise id never have dared
to have any dealings with you ill pick
you up near the mosque on muscat
street and i dont want to have to
drag you out from under some table or
away from some brown-skinned wench
either
  ill be there sober and respectable
he assured her but how about a little
drink hefore you go
  no thanks she declined i prefer
to keep our relationship on a strictly
business basis and whiskey gives men
ideas ill see you at dusk
  and she swung out of the room with
a long-legged hip-swaying gait that made
clanton moan with despair and grab
the whiskey bottle sle had him buf-
faloed if shed been anybody else hed
have made a pass at her regardless but
there was a limit even to his audacity
and he didnt dare try any rough stuff
on the daughter of old man allison mil-
lionaire and woolly wolf of finance that
the old devil was
  he turned the ivorv dragon about in
his hands and frowned
  antique collectin eh  hokum 
t sing he bellowed to a half-caste
waiter plunked a coin on the table
and barged out of a side door a few
moments later he was seated in a silk
shop kept by one yakub an old jew
who had a finger in many enterprises be-
sides the one advertised by the sign over
his door and whose ear was always close
to the mysterious pulse of the east clan-
ton set the ivory dragon before him and
demanded  whats that 
  yakub donned square steel-rimmed
spectacles and regarded it
  thats the kao tsu dragon he said
but i wouldnt handle it for you you
must have stolen it from shareef ahmed
i love life too much to handle anything
stolen from that devil
  its a fake asserted clanton
  if its a fake im a gentile an-
swered old yakub lovingly fondling its
smooth surface tchk tchk such a
pity  id buy it myself if i werent afraid
of ahmed hell slit your throat for
this sure
  youll swear its genuine clanton
demanded
 my head on it the old mans
sincerity was convincing
  hmmm clantons scowl deepened
i wonder what that hussys tryin to
put over
  then he asked yakub a strange ques-
tion and received a stranger answer
 f marianne allison had known of
that conversation her poise might
have been a trifle less confident when her
big coupe purred up to the curb where
clanton stood just as the street lights
were coming on he climbed in beside
her and she turned off down a side-
street according to his directions
  did you bring any money in case
ram lai wants more  he asked
  i should say not she retorted hes
been paid enough he owes me any fu-
ture service it takes to get the right
dragon
  youre an arrogant wench he ob-
served his eyes glued on a rounded knee
through accident or design her dress

spicy-adventure stories
iad worked up again baring an inch
of white skin above the stocking-top
  when you get through inspecting
my legs she suggested you might tell
me which way to turn at this next inter-
section
  she smiled cruelly as he reluctantly
turned his attention to the street feel-
ing perfectly safe from him she took a
feminine delight in tantalizing him she
was aware of her effect on him and she
enjoyed seeing the veins in his forehead
swell with frustrated emotion
  pull up here he directed presently
and they rolled to a halt in a shabby side-
street in the native quarter have to
leave the boat here they may steal
the wheels off of it before we get back
but it wont navigate the alley weve got
to follow here this is it
  it was dark in the alley they groped
their way along and presently came out
into an open space lined on one side
by rotten deserted wharves
  thats the warehouse clanton in-
dicated a building looming darkly before
them hes got a camp cot and some
canned grub in one of the lower rooms
and he aims to hide there till  let him
know what move ahmeds makin about
that theft
ivto light showed behind the shut-
 ters of the barred windows clanton
knocked and softly called ram lai
no answer he tried the door and found
it to be unlocked he pushed it open
and marianne pressed close on his heels-
as he entered she jumped and grabbed
his arm as they stood in the darkness
  the door somebody pushed it to
behind us
  wind must have blown it shut he
grunted but where the hells ram
lai 
  listen she clutched him convul-
sively somewhere in the darkness
sounded a steady drip-drip as if some-
body had left a faucet partly open but
clantons hair began to rise because
he knew there wasnt any faucet in that
room he struck a match in a hurry and
held it up marianne clapped a hand over
her mouth to stifle a shriek clanton
swore in the wavering light they saw
ram lai the fat swarthy babu slumped
drunkenly in a chair near a table his
head lolled on his breast and his eves
were glassy and from a throat slashed
from ear to ear blood still oozed slug-
gishly to fall drop by drop in a widen-
ing crimson puddle on the floor
  god almighty muttered clanton
weve got to get out of here-ow
  something that glinted swished at
him out of the shadows marianne had
a brief glimpse of an arc of gleaming
steel and a dark contorted face behind
it then the match went out clipped
from clantons hand by that slashing
blade and the dark filled with hair-rais-
ing sounds marianne dropped to the
floor and scurried on all-fours in the di-
rection she hoped the door was shed
lost touch with clanton but he couldnt
be dead because  corpse could put
up the fight he was putting up
  lurid anglo-saxon oaths mingled
with asiatic yowls and she almost pitied
his adversaries as she heard what
sounded like beeves being knocked in the
head with a maul but which she knew
to be the impact of his massive fists on
human skulls howls of pain and rage
filled the room the table overturned
crashingly and then somebody stumbled
over her in the dark
tt was a malay she could tell by the
a smell even in the dark she heard
him floundering on the floor near her
and her blood froze at the wheep-ztheep
the dragon of kao tsu


spicy-adventure stories
of a keen blade being whirled at random
it was close behind her and the flesh of
her hips contracted as she scuttled away
on her all-fours her groping hands
found a door and pulled it open but no
light came in and she felt steps leading
upward but any avenue of escape from
that blind blade flailing the blackness
was welcome
  she shut the door behind her and
went up the stair as fast as she could
and eventually emerged into an equally
dark space that felt big and empty and
smelled musty there she crouched
shivering while the noise of battle went
on below until it culminated in an amaz-
ing crash that sounded as though some-
body had been knocked bodily through a
closed door then the sounds died away
and silence reigned she believed that
clanton had broken away from his at-
tackers and fled pursued by them
  she was right at that moment clan-
ton was racing down a winding alley
hearing the pad of swift feet close be-
hind him and momentarily expecting a
knife thrust in the back they were too
many for even him to fight with his bare
hands and they were gaining on him
with a straining burst of eftort he reach-
ed an empty dim-lit side-street ahead of
them and before he vanished into an en-
trance on the other side he cast some-
thing on the paving in the light of the
dim street-lamp
  startled yelps escaped his pursuers
and abandoning the chase they pounced
ori the yellowed ivory dragon clanton
had discarded
  back in the loft of the deserted ware-
house marianne crept down the stairs
for some time she had heard no sound
below then just as she reached the
stair-door she checked her heart in her
throat somebody had entered the room
bevond but this man wore the boots of
a white man she could tell by his foot-
falls then she heard a smothered eng-
lish oath
  qanton must have eluded his pur-
suers and returned she heard a match
struck and light stole through the crack-
under the door she pushed the door
ajar a brawny figure wearing a sea-
mans cap with his back to the door
was bending over the corpse slumped in
the chair
  clanton she exclaimed stepping
into the room-then checked in her
tracks as a perfect stranger whirled
around with an oath he was as big
at clanton and much uglier his blood-
shot eyes glared his black beard bristled
and he levelled a snub-nosed revolver
at her quivering tummy
  dont shoot she gasped i-i
wont hurt you
  the strangers reply was unprintable
evidently her sudden appearance had
given him a bad shock
  who the blinkin hell are you and
whatre you doin here he concluded
well talk before i start sweepin the
floor with you he flourished a fist the
size of a breakfast ham under her shrink-
ing nose
  she shuddered and spoke hastily i
lost my way and wandered in here by
mistake-ive got to go now-glad to
have met you-
  stow it bellowed the irate intruder
you cant pull the wool over bull
davies eyes like that the aforesaid
eyes narrowed wickedly in the light of
the candle on a wall-shelf oh i get
it he muttered of course youre
after the dragon yourself you killed
ram lai to get it well hand it over
and you wont get hurt-maybe 
  i havent got it she answered and
i didnt kill ram lai shareef ahmeds
men did that they were waiting in the
the dragon of kao tsu

dark when i and my companion came
in here i dont know where they went
or what happened to the man with me
likely yarn grumbled mr davies
ram lai knew my boss wanted the
dragon he sent me word to come here
tonight and make him an offer hed
stole it from shareef ahmed i just now
got here and found him dead and the
dragon gone it aint on him-it must
be on you he pointed a hairy and ac-
cusing finger at marianne
  i tell you t havent got it she ex-
claimed paling i want it yes if youll
help me find it ill pay you-
  ive already been paid he growled
and my boss would cut my throat if
i sold him out youve got that dragon
on you somewheres you dames are
smart about hidin things on you off
with them clothes
 no she jumped back but he
grabbed her wrist and twisted it until
she fell to her knees with a yelp of pain
  are you goin to shed em your-
self or do i have to tear em off he
rumbled if i have to itll be the worse
for you blast you 
  let me up she begged i know
when im licked ill do it
and under his piglike eyes she shed
garment after garment until she
stood before him clad only in a scanty
brassiere and ridiculously brief pink
panties as she discarded each garment
he snatched it and ransacked it snarling
his anger at finding his quest fruitless
now he glared at her silent and wrath-
ful and she squirmed and made protect-
ing motions with her hands red fires
that were not of rage began to glimmer
murkily in his blood-shot eyes
  isnt this enough she begged you
could see if i had anything on me the
size of that dragon
  well maybe he admitted grudging-
ly laying a heavy hand on her naked
shoulder and turning her about to inspect
her from every angle
  baby youve got what it takes he
muttered thickly clapping a hot sweaty
hand down on her smooth back no
its easy to see you aint got that dragon
hid on you he grinned wickedly as
one hand started to move lower she
shrieked and slapped him resoundingly
and instantly regretted her indescretion
he grabled her in a bear-like embrace
and his ardor wasnt lessened a bit by
the glassy stare of the dead man in the
chair
  he was carrying her squirming and
fighting toward the camp-cot in the
corner when he stiffened
  outside the door sounded a faint
babble of approaching voices he blew
out the candle and turned through an
inner door clapping a big paw over
mariannes mouth when she tried to
scream and hissingi shut up you little
fool do you want your throat cut
thats ahmeds men
  he seemed to know his way about the
warehouse even in the dark he stooped
fumbled at the floor raised a trap-door
whispered if i hear one peep out of
you ill come down there and twist your
head off  ill get you out later-if youre
a good girl-and dropped her
qhe was too scared to yell even if
shed had breath for it she did not
fall far till she hit on her feet on a slimy
floor she heard the trap-door settle
back in place and then the creak of the
stairs evidently davies was taking
refuge in the loft she thought she heard
an outer door open and a mumble of
voices but forgot it the next instant at
the sight of small red eyes winking
fiercely at her from the gloom rats 

spicy-adventure stories
  she had all a womans natural fear of
rodents and she had heard horrifying
tales about the ghoulish wharf-rats but
they made no move to attack her and
she began to explore her prison shiver-
ing in her near nudity the stone floor
stood in several inches of water and she
found no opening in the slimy walls she
had been dumped into a cellar and the
only way out was up through that trap-
door above her head
  she squealed as a rat ran across her
foot and jumped back against the wall
bruising her hip and tearing her panties
on a broken plank
  this is what i get for associating
with people like bill clanton she told
herself bitterly and then the rats started
fighting in a corner their hideous
racket snapped her taut nerves she
screamed she yelled she was too
panicky to care for davies threat hav-
ing her head twisted off seemed prefer-
able to being devoured by rats in that
black well she didnt care who heard
her just so somebody did and got her
out of that damnable cellar she didnt
care much what they did to her after-
ward
  and almost instantly her shrieks were
answered by sounds overhead the trap
was lifted and she blinked in the glare
of a lantern but it was not davies
bearded face which was framed in the
opening it was a dark saturnine hand-
some face-the face of shareef ahmed
  well our little guest didnt run
away after all he commented satiri-
cally help her up jum chin
 tall gaunt chinese reached his
long arms down caught her lifted
wrists and swung her up lightly and
easily the trap-door fell again and she
found herself standing before ahmed
whose dark eyes devoured her from head
the dragon of kao tsu

to foot four malays with krises in their
belts together with the chinaman feasted
their hot eyes on her semi-nudity they
were marked generously from clantons
fists from that fight in the dark room
  a curious interlude smiled ahmed
dangerously you enter the building
fully clothed with that dog clanton ap-
parently you escape in the melee but
less than an hour later we find you im-
prisoned in the cellar half-naked his
eyes went to the white hip exposed by
the accident she flinched but did not
reply nor resent the indignity she was
scared as only a girl cartfbe who knows
herself to be in the power of men abso-
lutely merciless and cynical in their at-
titude toward women
  where is the kao tsu dragon
ahmed demanded peremptorily
  i havent it her wits were work-
ing lik-e lightning on a scheme
  ahmeds eyes were poisonous
  you must have it ram lai stole
two dragons out of my house clanton
dropped one in his flight he displayed
it but it is not the right one you
must have it ram lai must have stolen
them for you otherwise clanton who
came here with you would not have had
this one you have the other or know
where it is must you be persuaded to
talk
  i had it she said hurriedly as the
malays moved toward her grinning
evilly but bull davies came while you
were chasing clanton-
  davies it was a snarl from ahmed
has that dog of general kais been
here 
  he is here-hiding upstairs he took
the dragon from me
  search the upper floor snapped
ahmed and his men made for the stair
soft-footed as weasels with naked blades
glimmering in their hands marianne

spicy-adventure stories
breathed in momentary relief at least
shed saved herself from torture for the
moment ahmed was watching the stair
and she essayed a sneaking step toward
the other door but he wheeled and
caught her wrist
  where are you going
  nowhere apparently she flinched
at his sarcasm please youre hurting
my wrist why the bodys gone
  we threw it in the river after we
returned from pursuing clanton said
ahmed absently gazing at her half-ex-
posed breasts i meant to take ram
lai alive and make him talk but he
attacked my faithful servant jum chin
who traced him here and jum chin was
forced to kill him i arrived with the
rest of my men just after he had killed
ram lai we had just completed a fruit-
less search of the body when we heard
you and clanton approaching why did
you come here when you already had the
dragon 
  i came to pay ram lai she lied
afraid to admit the truth now that she
had already professed to have had pos-
session of the dragon
  forget the dragon for a space he
muttered his eyes were like flames lick-
ing her sleek body my men will cap-
ture davies and get it for me mean-
while-you and i   
tjealizing his intentions she
sprang for the nearest door but he
was too quick for her he was slender
but his thews were like steel she yelped
as he reached for her-squealed despair-
ingly as she realized how helpless she
was she clenched a small fist and struck
him in the face and in return got a slap
that filled her eyes with stars and tears
he picked her up fighting and kicking
and started toward the other room with
her when upstairs a shot banged blows
thudded men yelled and heavy boots
stampeded down the stair
  ahmed dropped marianne sprawling
on the floor and turned to the stair door
drawing a pistol an instant later bull
davies plunging through the stair-door
brought up short at the threat of that
black muzzle in an instant the five
orientals who were tumbling down the
stair after him had fallen on him from
behind borne him to the floor and had
him bound hand and foot swift hands
ransacked his garments and then jum
chin looked at ahmed and shook his
head ahmed turned on marianne who
lose from the floor rubbing her hip
  you slut you said he had it
ahmed grabbed a pink-white shoulder
and squeezed viciously
  wait she begged assuming a
venus demedici pose as he started to
go even further in his third-degree
methods he must have hidden it
  this was going to be just too bad tor
davies she knew but it was his hide or
hers maybe shed get a chance to slip
away while they were giving him the
works
  at a word from ahmed turn chin
ripped davies shirt off a malay ap-
plied a lighted match to his hairy breast
a faint smell of singed hair arose and
davies bellowed like a bull
  i tell you i aint got it shes lyin
i dunno where it is
  if hes lying well soon know
rasped ahmed well try a test that
will unlock the jaws of the stubbomest
if he still persists we must conclude that
hes telling the truth and the girls
lying
  jum chin stripped off the prisoners
socks and davies broke into a sweat of
fear intent on the coming torture
ahmed relaxed his grip on mariannes
the dragon of kao tsu

wrist-or maybe it was a trick to trap
her into a false move
  as his fingers relaxed she jerked
loose and darted into the outer room he
was after her in an instant and just as
she reached the door that opened into
the alley his fingers locked in her hair
but that door burst suddenly inward
a btg form loomed in the door and
an arm shot out there was a crack
that sounded as if ahmed had run his
face into a brick wall but it was a
massive fist he had run into and the
impact stretched him groaning on the
floor his conqueror swooped on the
pistol that flew from his victims hand
and ahmeds henchmen rushing from
the inner room checked at the menace
of the leveled luger their hands shoot-
ing ceilingwaid
  clanton panted marianne pie re-
fused to look at her with six desperate
men before him he couldnt risk being
demoralized by the spectacle of loveli-
ness her unclad figure presented
  put on some clothes i he snapped
and you ahmed get up
  ahmed staggered up a ghastly sight
minus three teeth and with his nose a
gory ruin clanton grinned pridefully
at the sight of his handiwork few men
could have done so much damage with
only one clout he profanely silenced
ahmeds impassioned ravings and
backed all his prisoners into the inner
room whither marianne followed hav-
ing salvaged the table cloth which she
wrapped rather sketchily sarong-fashion
about her
  briefly she explained the situation to
clanton and he ordered the men to lie
on their bellies and put their hands
behind them while she tied their wrists
and ankles with their belts and turbans
he watched her in ecstatic silence while
she was thus employed the improvised
sarong was something more than reveal-
ing as she moved about allowing
glimpses of sweet contours that sent the
blood to his head
vvthen she had finished the job he
inspected each man grunting his
approval of her technique and searching
them for weapons he lingered longer
over jum chin and when he rose she
was amazed to see a grey pallor tinging
the chinamans face yet clanton had
done nothing to hurt liim
  clanton then untied davies and
growled i ought to bust your snoot
for pullin off miss allisons clothes and
throwin her in that cellar but im
lettin you off considerin what ahmed
did to you get out
  ill get even with somebody i bet
sniveled mr davies and departed hasti-
ly aided in his exit by the toe of the
clanton boot when his lamentations
had faded in the night clanton ad-
dressed his glowering prisoners
  were leaving ill send back a coolie
to untie you ahmed you better forget
whats happened tonight the dragons
gone only ram lai knew what became
of it and hes dead and if the british
find out you killed him theyll hang you
sure as hell you let us alone and keep
your mouth shut and well keep ours
shut
  fear gleamed in ahmeds one good
eye at the mention of hanging he was
sullenly silent as clanton followed the
girl into the outer room and closed the
door behind them
  do you think hell drop the matter 
she asked nervously  can t afford to
have this story get in the papers
  no you cant he agreed theft

blood
 by alan anderson
when the guard had passed a
grimy hand picked up a stick
and struck the stone wall three
light blows the reply came dully there
was a crack in the wall festered lips
pressed there
  spartacus  be ye well 

 i hunger i thirst in time i shall
 perish came the weak reply
 courage spartacus we too hun-
 ger
 be there news
 nay madness hast assuredly seized
 our master thou who art his greatest
and fire
julians whole fortune was due to the skill of spartacus his
gladiator and yet its a female slave who saves spartacus
when his master betrays him
                                               the gladiators chains snapped like rotten
                                               cloth heedless of the lash he leaped
treasure lie rotting in a dungeon	perished from the hundred lashes yet
and thou	our master still buys slaves roman
we too starve the nubian hast armies have conquered


spicy-adventure stories
  cursed be these roman dogs said
spartacus in a savage voice
  today ten female slaves arrive but
caution  be ready a few crumbs  wilt
blow through the crack food is pre-
cious tis all we can spare
  the man dusted crumbs into the crack
and blew on the other side spartacus
caught them in his cupped hand at the
roof of the dungeon there was a tiny
barred window in the wall it admitted
a faint light spartacus carried the
crumbs to a hole at the base of the oppo-
site wall he piled them there
  then he knelt to one side and picked
up a stone he crouched in statue-like
immobility time passed a half an
hour he did not move an hour went
by his bones ached and his flesh was
cold still he was motionless
rthen there was a faint movement at
the hole a tiny whiskered snout ap-
peared spartacus tensed a gray head
appeared button black eyes surveyed
the place assured a huge rat stuck his
head into the dungeon then its shoul-
ders a wet tongue began to lick up the
crumbs the stone fell the rat per-
ished
  with a knife-sharp stone spartacus
gutted the beast and skinned it then he
disjointed it and began to devour the
still warm flesh the meat was tough
and bitter but he wolfed it down he
cracked the skull and sucked out the
brains the eyes too he ate hi stom-
ach threatened to revolt he got up and
paced the floor
  i be a spartan he assured himself
all the might of the roman empire
canst not bend my will
  strength swept through his body and
his despair lightened he returned to the
remains of the rat squeezed out the en-
trails and ground his teeth on the elastic
tissue
  thirty and three days in this stink-
ing dungeon he muttered to himself
new slaves eh and twas my skill
that won them yet my bloated master
julian hast thrown me into this
wretched dungeon patience spartacus
suffering makes vengeance the sweeter
  he laughed a trifle madly and hate
blazed in his eyes then knowing the
madness that might result from inac-
tivity he swept up the remains of the
rat and hid them behind a loose stone in
the wall three knocks echoed dismally
throughout the dungeon he went to the
wall
  be warned spartacus many guards
cross the yard
  but by the time die guards reached
the dungeons the crack had been filled
with mortar the slaves herded like
cattle were taken from the building and
marched to the basement of the villa
where hot baths awaited them
  our master julian hast guests
whispered joseph the judean to spar-
tacus again he displays his worldly
goods
  the slaves bathed were given clean
loin cloths and after their hands had
been shackled were escorted to the main
room of the villa
  it was a huge room with luxurious
couches forming a rectangle within the
walls between each couch and set on
a waist-high pedestal of stone were
brass braziers filled with burning char-
coal they were about two feet in di-
ameter and gave off a pleasant heat
spartacus thought of the death chill of
his dungeon and smiled it was not a
nice smile
declining on one of the couches
and with a female slave squatting
blood and fire

on the floor at his head julian held a
cup of wine in one hand with the other
he ruffled the red curls of the slave who
was viewing the male slaves with con-
tempt behind julian stood a handsome
youth attired in the colorful cape of the
empresss own guard next to him stood
a well-formed not unhandsome woman
some thirty years of age whose face
bore the stamp of cruelly
  these be my fighting slaves sister
said julian to the woman with a careless
wave at the men before them
  a well-scarred rabble but one said
she who be the scarless one  a fledg-
ling
  ho ho laughed julian and his
great belly rolled that man be spar-
tacus the greatest gladiator in all the
empire a hundred and ten men hast
he slain
  his eyes be gray and methinks hate
simmers there said the woman but
added yet he is young and handsome
what be thy price
  to julian he lie priceless said the
youth at her side but for spartacus
julian would have no riches
  julian colored
  hold thy tongue cousin aristius
he ordered thou hatest me that i
know but this be my household
  aye aristius said the woman
thou art a fool thou who believes in
free men and maids
  sister said julian in five days
spartacus fights again thou must stay
for the games four days hence cousin
aristius wilt match his gray arabs at
the chariot races at the circus maximus
mayhap disaster wilt plague him
  they laughed at that the fight slaves
milled uneasily although they knew of
the games the word had been passed
that julian would enter none in the lists
spartacuss face was expressionless but
his gray eyes were cold and glazed with
hate thanks to julians drunkeness the
whole fiendish plot had been given away
rage welled within the spartan but he
betrayed it not he was of the land of
stoics
  so this be spartacus said julians
sister and her eyes traveled over the
slaves magnificently muscled body
his fame be great
  come come cried julian i
weary of this
  the sister laughed
  aye thou wouldst view the ten fe-
male slaves
tulian shrugged and ordered that the
slaves be brought in on the floor the
red head had slyly opened the bodice of
her robe to reveal some of the pert
whiteness of her small breasts only
spartacus remained serene the girl
laughed drunkenly and lifted her skirt
wrhite legs gleamed
  the female slaves weighted with
chains were herded into the room they
varied in color from a coal black nubian
to a milk white maiden of the rhine all
were ineffectively attired in tatters here
and there a bare leg appeared and
through rents small expanses of vari-
colored breasts were visible
  expressions varied the nubian was
dejected and resigned to her fate the
maid of the valley of the rhine was
smiling invitingly as were others to
gain the favor of their new master and
therehy win a life of ease and luxury
  only one was defiant she was a
young girl of no great stature yet su-
perbly formed her black hair blacker
eves and olive swarthiness proclaimed
her a daughter of andalusia which was
not yet spain she had obviously been
roughly handled by the guards for her
robe was in rags her left thigh and hip

spicy-adventure stories
were bare to the waist and reflected a
golden shimmer the cloth had been
torn partly from her left breast but she
had covered it with her hand a gesture
which accented the protrusion of the
dome-shaped flesh and the smallness of
her hand her beauty was of such in-
tensity that a hush greeted her presence
  a maid to my liking declared
julian and rose to one elbow-a physical
exertion for him
  thou shall have me not cried the
girl and faced him this brought her
back into spartacuss line of vision a
gloriously nude back wedge-shaped and
so fine grained that it glistened like
polished wood he saw that her hips
were richly curved in the first bloom of
womanhood and that her legs were
straight and finely shaped thrills raced
through the spartan here was a woman
of his own kind beautiful desirable and
spirited
  then shall thou clean the oftal from
blood and fire

my kitchen until thy tune does change
said julian with a yawn
 roman pig she cried between
clenched teeth
  give her five lashes ordered julian
with a frown that wilt change her
tune
  a burly guard stepped up a long
lash circled through the air there was
a sharp crack and a livid welt appeared
on that glossy back the girl cried out
but did not wince the lash flecked out
it cut a furrow across her shoulder
blades and the heavy tip snapped into
the first swell of her breast blood came
spartacus was fired with rage julian
laughed as did his sister aristius was
pale the lash cracked the girl fell to
one knee
oomething snapped in spartacuss
 brain his arms tensed chains parted
like rotten cloth he sprang toward
julian who was blubbering with fear
the red-haired slave jumped to her feet
spartacus shoved her she fell across
julians stomach turned completely over
and landed on the other side of the
couch a lash bit into spartacuss flesh
many hands seized him consumed with
rage he jerked free the burly guard
spun him around and struck out with
the butt of the lash
  spartacus blocked the blow his hard
fist hit the guard in the mouth he fell
back spitting out blood and teeth but
many hands were seizing the spartan
bodies pressed against him he fought
desperately hopelessly he fell under
the weight of numbers ropes were
being tied to his wrists and ankles his
vision blurred a moment
  then he was alone on the floor with
julian standing above him to one side
he could see the andalusian her black
eyes had lost their hate were soft and
grateful
  cursed spartan cried julian livid
with rage
  he kicked spartacus in the face
blood came he kicked again and again
flesh became swollen and numbed but
the gray eyes did not lose their hate
then julian had the lash and was laying
it on with all the strength of his bloated
body the spartan endured the torture
without a vestige of pain then merci-
fully came unconsciousness
tte returned to consciousness in
his dungeon his body ached intol-
erably but he got to his feet dizziness
possessed him but he endured it with-
out protest he felt his face it was
puffed and sore to the touch physically
spartacus uttered an
animal cry of rage

spicy-adventure stories
he was a wreck of a man but within
him burned tierce fires of hate and deter-
mination
  julian had been too loose with his
tongue thirty and three days in the
dungeon was explained could he a lone
slave combat the power of julian and
the might of an empire was there no
way to avert this diabolical plot  he sat
down and thought
  presently he went to the wall and sig-
naled
  joseph tis spartacus be the arv-
dalusian well 
  ten more lashes she got but she
lives even though on a bed of blood
tis well hark ye well joseph
pass the word that spartacus wouldst
speak with aristius
  thou hast plans  said the jutean
excitedly
  aye death to julian freedom for
all of us
  saying no more spartacus returned
to the warmest corner of his dungeon
and sat staring at the dark walls a new
sense of hope buoyed him there was a
smile on his cut lips-not a nice smile
by any means
  spartacus wouldst speak with ari-
stius r
  bv mysterious channels the word
sped from the cleaning slave it went to
the villa it traveled through the kitchen
and to the stables there a slave wrote
it on the under side of a saddle while
his companion kept guard later a ser-
vant came to the stables for a horse
  if thou goest to the city said one
of the slaves thou shalt have the white
steed tis the masters orders
  aye i ride to the city
  the two slaves exchanged knowing
glances the saddle was put  the
horse the servant departed reached the
city and went to a public stable there
a slave saw a small mark on the stirrup
which foretold a message within the
saddle he read it carefully memorized
it another slave came in
  be there a steed of aristius here
nay but one of marcus who lives
nearby
  then bring me his saddle
hphus was the grapevine telegraph
which all the might of imperial rome
had not uncovered
  the news reached aristius at supper
he frowned turned to his lovely wife
and said
  treachery brews at julians if only
this gladiator hast devised the downfall
of my cousin he got up and paced the
floor the ruin of julian wouldst please
the emperor for the fat fool waxes in
wealth and power
  then thou shall go asked his wife
aye this spartacus is a man to my
liking
a fter a sleepless foodless night
spartacus was summoned to the
crack his face had lost some of its sore-
ness but he was still weak and ex-
hausted yet strong purpose drove away
despair
  spartacus tis aristius
  aristius how got ye here
  by a ruse in the guise of a physician
what knowest thou 
  that julian doest plan to gain riches
beyond his fondest dream said spar-
tacus bitterly for thirty and four days
have i rotted in this cell knowest thou
why 
  nay it is senseless
   tis the whim of a satan julian
weakens me that i lose to this gladiator
of gaul he bets against me for the odds
be great then shall he prosper by my
death
blood and fire

  there was a brief silence as aristiuss
shocked brain accepted the devilish plan
and thy plan asked aristius
  i shall not die declared spartacus
bet ye all thy gold and treasures on me
julian wilt wager his toga if needs be
but i have not such riches for thou
art the favorite and for each gold coin
against thee i must answer with ten
aye but if tongues tattle of julians
plan then the odds wilt fall
  but thou if he starves thee thou
canst not win
  i have thought of that two days
before the game contrive that the
officials of the coliseum shall visit here
and examine my health
   tis a cunning stroke declared
aristius in high humor for this what
doest thou desire
  freedom for me and the andalusian
slave freedom for the fighting slaves
they shall fight as free men and pay
you what thou wagers but ask them
  there was the murmur of voices as
aristius consulted joseph the judean
nominal head of the fighting slaves
soon aristius returned to the crack
   tis agreed i trust thee spartacus
i wilt need gold beyond my riches but
i guard the empresss jewels fail me
not for it would ruin me and bring
death to my wife
  i shall perish not declared spar-
tacus in a strong purposeful voice
there be others to think of be at
peace friend aristius do thy part and
i shall do mine
  aritius departed he was determined
to follow the agreed plan but misgivings
assailed him all his gold all his prop-
erty and every possession of his wifes
would not be enough well he had the
four gray arabs horses of great worth
hed bet them too and he could borrow
the empresss jewels for a reason he
couldnt fathom his faith in spartacus
was limitless
r i hat day spartacus had a stroke of
good fortune he could reach the
solitary window at the ceiling where
he habitually clung watching the yard
a sleek well-fed cat of the villa hail the
misadventure to explore the barred
window a strong hand choked the life
from its body with his right arm
scratched and bloody spartacus feasted
there was meat to spare his spirits
soared the games were four days off
  the next day the gossip started by
aristius bore fruit many gamblers
came to julian demanding to see spar-
tacus he demured that night the odds
fell slobbering with rage julian con-
tinued to bet then he was struck by an
inspiration prompted by the devil him-
self
  get ye to these gamblers he ordered
his steward and tell them to repair
here two days before the games then
i shall show them spartacus in the
meantime feed him well and remove him
from the dungeon
  but sire the bets
  continue to bet on the gaul i have
devised a plan
  then spartacus shall fall
  aye he wilt die at the sword point
of this gaul declared julian and his
pig-like eyes narrowed he laughed
the problem was solved
vvell-fed carefully cared for and
provided with every comfort spar-
tacus knew that terror of impending
disaster which gave no clue as to its
nature worry consumed him julian
had devised his defeat but how
  two days before the games gamblers
and officials of the coliseum visited the
spartan they found him in perfect

spicy-adventure stories
health the physicians examination re-
vealed no reason why he should from a
physical standpoint lose the combat
  thou cunning one said a gambler
to the leering julian thou started the
rumor that the odds fall then did thou
bet on thy gladiator
  the odds immediately rose to new
heights one gold coin wagered on the
gaul demanded fifteen from those who
bet on spartacus aristiuss faith never
wavered but his riches and those of his
wife were pledged the next day he
would race his arabs at the chariot races
he became nervous and absent-minded
his wife who knew nothing of the
matter was concerned but that night he
would guard the precious jewels of his
empress
ttfte next day aristius won the
chariot races at the circus maximus
he decreed it a good omen from the
riches got from the pawned empresss
jewels he covered every bet of julian
who had pledged his wealth down to
ever stone of his villa
  that night spartacus thanks to a
compound made by the clever judean
enjoyed a dreamless sleep he awakened
the day of the games refreshed and in
splendid condition but his brain was
cold with fear when the guards came to
lead him to his master he was seemingly
possessed and unworried they chained
his wrists and led him to the kitchens
there they left him alone while they
went to julian for instructions
  a movement at the doorway captured
spartacuss attention there stood the
andalusian viewing him with smoulder-
ing eyes
  she wore a sack-like robe but even
thai could not hide the splendor of her
figure her breasts tented the fabric
and through the cloth he could see
the nut-brown gloss of them a draught
of air beat the skirt of the robe back
against her legs outlining the fine firm-
ness of her ample thighs and the deli-
cious curves of her matchless hips
  then she walked to him and her
breasts began a faint swaying and trem-
bling and her hips swayed with a
seductive rhythm her full scarlet lips
were half parted to reveal white teeth
and her nostrils were slightly dialated
her eyes were black diamonds that sent
a shiver down the spartans spine her
mere presence was intoxicating he
swallowed the lump in his throat
  i love thee she whispered in a
fierce vibrant tone thou art assuredly
my man for always
  and i thee love he said very
humbly the vision of thy loveliness
hast haunted me but for these bounds
my arms would devour thee
  then she took him in her arms and
her wet lips closed on his mouth
through the thin cloth the heat of her
body fired him and the lush softness of
her breasts flattened against the steel
hard muscles of his chest to impart to
his body an exotic weakness her mouth
pressed hard on his lips until her body
trembled and swayed like a column of
flame
  when she released him his lips were
bruised and swollen from the fury of
her kisses both were shaken and dizzy
  that she avowed is but a sample
of the love that is thine her hand went
to her breast clutched as if striving to
still the mad racing of her heart
  and thou must win spartacus my
love come what will thou must win
thou swears to that
  mad laughter flooded the room before
spartacus could reply
blood and fire

tulian was in the doorway and at
 his side and uncommonly drunk
stood the red-haired slave she giggled
sillily and entered the room then she
walked up to spartacus and pressed
him against her chest
   instantly the andalusian grabbed two
 hands full of the streaming red hair
 she gave a vicious jerk and the girl fell
 to the floor but before the fight went
 further two guards entered and seized
 the women
   so thou shall win said julian and
 laughed ho then thou shall assured-
 ly be a god seize him men
   additional guards grabbed the spar-
 tan dragged him to an ante-chamber
 and lashed him to a small table he could
 not move fear gnawed at his brain he
 knew that now julian would take pains to
 insure his defeat then something
 crashed down on his skull and blackness
 closed in like a swift nightfall
   in the leg was the last thing he
slay the barbarian-or i forfeit my jewels
she whispered

spicy-adventure stories
heard julian say the straps of the san-
dals will conceal it
avtien spartacus awakened he saw
that lie was in the room wherein
gladiators of the villa were prepared be-
fore going to the coliseum he was
stretched out on a board and many hands
were massaging him
  he moved and terror brought sweat
to his brow he was as weak as a kit-
ten his eyes clouded then cleared
joseph was there at his side slaves were
packed about the table he saw that the
andalusian was holding his hand her
face was pale somehow he managed
to smile
  a slave saw whispered joseph for
guards were at the door julian ast
had thou bled the swine
  the andalusian left but quickly re-
turned the slaves packed tighter about
the table stooping swiftly she closed
her mouth on his warm milk trickled
between his lips he sucked greedily
  thou art to have no food she whis-
pered just as another female slave
stooped and offered him a mouthful of
milk others brought milk then the
andalusian again joseph was grim and
wordless the guards saw no one bear-
ing food and were content
  blood he needs said the andalusian
with a fierce resolve to the silent joseph
they say that thou wert a physician in
thy homeland is there no way
  aye a method i learned from the
egyptians but tis dangerous a bub-
ble of air and he wilt perish should it
enter his blood stream
  he wilt perish anyway come we
of andalusia are rich in blood
  aye whispered someone there is
a glass tube here
  with the andalusians arm pressed
tight to his spartacus watched as jos-
eph got out a knife both arms were
opened the tube was inserted the
spartan was vaguely conscious that new
heat was passing into his blood he saw
the andalusian gradually grow pale his
fingers lost their coldness the girl wet
her lips she was unafraid soon it was
over joseph smeared a stinging oint-
ment on the incisions
  be quick  warned someone the
guards
  the guards camc into the room
  get him dressed was ordered
tager hands fastened on the sandals
and wound the straps to the calf
his waist was sashed and about it was
fastened a wide metal girdle soft leath-
er bound his wrists for greater strength
joseph who was to accompany him held
the visored helmet the sword would be
at the coliseum
  ha  laughed a guard julian is too
drunk to attend the games he dallies
avith the red head
  outside a chariot was waiting spar-
tacus was feeling stronger but he acted
weak and dazed he and joseph climbed
in behind the driver mounted guards
surrounded them to prevent any attempt
to escape a servant ran from the house
  the tartar is to return with the tid-
ings he called
  the tartar nodded and they set out
good time was made they arrived with-
out incident and entered the gladiator
quarters there was confusion there but
spartacus was well guarded aristius
white and shaking forced his way
through the crowd
  fear not spartacus confided i
gain strength every moment see me
before i enter the arena
  aristius vanished julians steward
replaced him
  if thou winst he whispered to spar-
blood and fire

tacus julian wilt have the andalusian
ravished afterward her body wilt be
fed to the dogs
  overhead came the roar of forty-
five thousand spectators as some contest
ended then came the impatient shuf-
fling of feet as patrons consulted their
programs next spartacus their favor-
ite would meet the gaul what rumors
had been going around
  joseph fastened on the shield spar-
tacus raised it held it over his head then
lowered it he was slow that worried
him the bleeding had weakened him
more than hed thought
ready spartacus called an official
he got up and went to the iron doors
to the arena just as the bloody corpse of
a man was carried in he took the hel-
met from joseph aristius came up
  do as i bid said spartacus con-
trive to stop the tartar who wilt carry
the tidings to julian he is the man
with the black beard then have for me
outside thy own chariot with thyself at
the reins the combat julian shall hear
from my lips
  with his shield at attention and the
helmet cradled in his right arm spar-
tacus stood awaiting the summons it
came-the blare of trumpets
  he marched into the field to be greet-
ed by a great ovation of cheering the
stands rose as one man and cheer after
cheer flooded the city and why not-
here was the gladiator of all times the
man who had slain fifty more than his
nearest rival
  officials were in the center of the field
leveling the turf spartacus marched
toward the imperial box at one end of
the coliseum and from the corner of his
eye appraised the gaul who was angling
in from the opposite side they arrived
together and made their salutations to
the emperor and empress
  that julian wasnt there pleased
spartacus
  the empress leaned over the rail of
the box she was a superb beauty she
smiled but her eyes were worried
  all rome wishes thee well she told
spartacus slay this barbarian slay
him else   she lowered her voice
else i forfeit my jewels
tn shocked silence spartacu saluted
wheeled and marched toward the cen-
ter of the field aristius had told the
etnpress and she had pledged her
jewels his heart choked with pride
why the fate of the empire might hinge
on this combat
  he did not listen to the instructions
he knew by heart fear numled his
brain not for himself but for the an-
dalusian she was weak from loss of
blood her resistance would be low
that brown sleek body offered to juli-
an he shivered
  his helmet was put on it was pad-
ded and fit snugly about his head the
visor was cunningly fashioned to encom-
pass his face and chin the straps were
adjusted at his neck through the tiny
slits he saw the gaul his opponent
was a mountain of a man barrel chested
and a head taller than the spartan
moreover he was supremely confident
almost strutting then spartacus knew
that the gaul knew of his weakness the
blare of trumpets ended thought
  as was the custom they were first
given wooden swords and began their
mock combat before the silly custom
had gone far howls from the stands
prompted the emperor to end the fray
they were given short steel swords with
a guarded hilt and a double cutting edge
  for a moment or so they tested the
balance of their weapons the gaul cut

sunrise on an empty sea dark
clouds that made the sunlight cop-
per choppy waves that tossed the
hatch cover relentlessly
  the hatch cover was all that was left
of the freighter elba bound from bris-
bane to batavia through the torres
straits and the timor sea the blow
had caught her off point kennedy just
after she had dropped her rudder and
while she lay temporarily disabled
  now the hatch cover danced in the
choppy waters off the coast of papua
shipwrecked-dying of thirst on a hatch-cover in mid-ocean
and just as escape looms near moreland finds himself and
the girl in the power of a crazed sailor
    j
clint
lashed tightly to it was a woman
blonde almost nude her tender skin
blistered and reddened where the sun of
yesterday had poured cruelly down she
lay there with her eyes closed cracked
ips slightly parted arms flung wide one
hand and wrist dangling in the sea her
breasts rose and fell painfully only half
covered by shreds of a tom slip her
slim waist seemed hardly to move full
hips and tapering thighs were almost
completely exposed to the elements
  clinging to the rope that lashed her

spicy-adventure stories
firm his body in the water was don
moreland radio operator of the elba
he rested his chin and the side of his
face on the wooden cover his red hair
wild and wet flattened against the hatch
from time to time he licked the salt from
his parched lips spat into the water
green eyes burned with a strange tor-
tured light
  on die other side erf the hatch cover
griggs the melbourne engine wiper
also in the water with his claw-like fin-
gers twined in the same rope his face
was twisted seamed wracked by pain
the skin peeling from his skinny arms
and shoulders his lips too were puffed
and cracked but his eyes glowed with
the fire of madness
  one skinny hand released its grip
crawled slowly toward the white body of
the woman on the cover for a second
his fingers brushed soft feminine flesh
the woman did not move the mel-
bourne dockrat sank the fingers convul-
sively in yielding whiteness the woman
stirred her eyes came open she saw
the leering face of griggs and groaned
aloud tried to pull away
pvon moreland raised his red
head from the hatch cover glimpsed
the ugly drama before him his eyes
suddenly blazed inch by inch he made
his way through the waves around the
edge of the hatch cover he was almost
on griggs before he was seen the lit-
tle man released his hold started to
whimper and whine as he whined he
moved away moved for the opposite side
of the cover
  moreland yelled hoarsely through
cracked lips cast off griggs damn
you im going to throw you off if you
dont i told you id kill you if you
touched her again 
  aw sparks for the love of god i
was just seeing if she was alive dont
make me cast off id die man theyll
pick us up any time now  let me stay -
his voice was an abject whine
  the exhausted woman had relaxed
again lay with her eyes closed her
voice could hardly be heard give him
a chance don
  yeah whined griggs just a
chance its gonna squall again sparks
and i wouldnt get fifty yards look at
them clouds
  overhead black clouds were gather-
ing were racing through the skies as if
bound for a common destination those
clouds held wind and rain don more-
land knew that the sun dived behind
the clouds the velocity of the wind in-
creased
  then griggs saw it as the hatch
cover was tossed high he screamed
look look its a canoe a native
canoe and its empty as hell
  the girl strained upright moreland
heaved himself half up on the hatch cover
and peered into the wind he smelled
the canoe before he saw it recognized
the smell for the nauseating revolting
odor of putrifying flesh a native canoe
that had been swept to sea the crew
had no doubt died from thirst and star-
vation 
  and the wind was bringing the light
craft directly down upon them it would
pass some fifty yards to starboard with-
out a word he loosed his grip on the rope
tinned on his face and started toward
the drifting canoe with long even
strokes behind him he heard the voice
of griggs
  damn you damn you dont leave
us here sparks dont leave us well
die
the smell almost overwhelmed him
 as he rested on the outrigger of the
pygmy magic
small dugout he shook the saltwater
from his eyes made out a platform-like
bamboo structure built in the prow of
the canoe atop it was a rattan-wrapped
bundle a corpse  this then was a burial
canoe
  well it was no time to be squeamish
the wind was rising in a steady howl
the sky growing steadily darker two
more strokes and he made it clam-
bered over the side and squatted in the
bottom to catch his breath the stench
was terrible in the gloom he made out
three or four carved paddles a spear a
stone axe a war club this man evi-
dently a warrior had been sent to a sea
burial with his weapons
  don seized a clumsy paddle headed
the canoe for the hatch cover griggs
made for the boat moreland had to
threaten him with the paddle before he
would return to help irene garver from
the hatch cover some few minutes later
they were safely aboard the canoe more-
land crouched in the stern paddle in
hand griggs beneath the platform
whining in the prow and the girl
stretched out amidships
  griggs snapped moreland pick up
that axe and cut the body loose from the
platform its going to storm again and
it makes us top heavy griggs protested
but went to work hacking unsteadily at
the rattan cords
  suddenly he stopped staggered back
dropping the axe look at it look at
it he whimpered
  a jagged streak of lightning illumin-
ated the sea for a full two seconds as it
crackled across the heavens although
the body of the corpse was decomposed
the head had been mumified it was the
black gaunt face of the typical papuan
with a high bridged nose that bore a bone
ornament stuck through the base it was
painted in grotesque figures curling de-

signs fearful to see but it wasnt the
face that caused moreland to start and
shudder it was the hair wild and out-
standing like that of all bush savages it
was a vivid red in color and the de-
composed flesh of the body had at one
time been guilded a brilliant gold
  throw him over said moreland
hoarsely the body hit the sea and the
squall broke the rain come down in
torrents the girl lay flat on her back
and opened her mouth the feel of fresh
water was balm on her swollen tongue
her parched lips griggs and moreland
turned their faces toward the heavens
moreland tried to keep the frail canoe
pointed into the waves tried to keep the
gigantic breakers from swamping them
ttowr long he crouched there with
tortured muscles he never knew it
must have been all day for the sun did
not reappear when the wind died down
and the waves subsided the western sky
was stained a faint scarlet through its
grey moreland looked down at the
sleeping woman in the bottom of the
boat her whole body looked refreshed
what few wisps of clothing she still
possessed were wet and clinging scarcely
hiding a solitary curve of her chiseled
body
  from beneath the platform on the
prow of the boat moreland saw griggs
sweeping his inflamed little eyes over the
feminine loveliness that lay at his feet
he tried to mumble a curse tried to
warn griggs again but weariness over-
took him his bowed head sank down
on his chest his body was one long
exultant throb of paining muscles and
protesting flesh his eyes closed he
slept
  he was awakened by the sun high in
the heavens beating down on his sore
face seemingly from a great distance

spicy-adventure stories
ble on his chin ran down on his skinny
chest he muttered and driveled cackled
and laughed like a child with a new toy
the girl groaned as his clawlike hand
darted out to caress her
  griggs ill kill you damn you
ill kill you moreland wondered if
that harsh voice were his own the eyes
griggs turned toward him were those
of a madman the irises had almost
entirely disappeared it was as if the
pupil was alone on the white eyeball
  yah he bawled youll kill me
he  he i he ive got you lashed mate
he fell back with a cry the dart
sticking in his chest
he heard a low moaning sound for a
moment he lay with his eyes closed try-
ing to remember where he was remem-
brance came to him with the force of a
slap in the face eyes opened again he
tried to sit up something was holding
his wrists with the long strips of rattan
that had held the corpse to the boat
with a great effort he was able to raise
his head to peer toward the bow of the
boat
  irene garver was lashed to the under
side of the platform more of the ragged
clothing had been torn from her body
and squatted beside her was griggs his
red little eyes gloating over the sight of
her palpitant flesh saliva ran unheeded
from his blue lips drooled over the stub-
pygmy magic

and ive got all the weapons in this end
of the boat well die ay well all
die but horace griggsll die happy
were hungry and were thirsty and well
die of that but all my life ive wanted
a fine lady and now-the captains
daughter
  he threw himself toward the bound
girl in an ecstasy of slobbering delight
  be still you she-devil he roared as
the woman tried to fight herself away
ill cut your soft white throat so help
me
  moreland shuddered as he saw the
stone knife in the madmans hand saw
its sharp point bite rnto the base of the
white throat the girl lay still stiffened
rigidly the madman laughed thisll
learn you he dragged the knife down
across her collar bone into the yielding
flesh below the girl groaned more-
land roared griggs laughed as the knife
left a slender red wake from which oozed
tiny gleaming globules of blood
  blood blood screamed griggs
he he he not blue but red like
mine
  moreland strained at his bonds until
he fell exhausted in the stern for a
long time there was silence from the
bow of the boat the girl thought
moreland has fainted thank god then
the silence was broken by the wheezing
breathing of the madman interspersed
with stupid little giggles nauseated
moreland tried not to watch
t ong hours later something sharp
stuck him in the chest he opened
his eyes to see griggs standing near the
middle of the boat he bore the stone
axe in one hand the long sharp spear
in the other a spear point was prod-
ding moreland
  im gonna cut you loose sparks and
youre going to paddle us toward that
grey cloud it looks like a shore line to
me the shore means something to eat
dont forget ill be standing over you
with a spear and an axe if you try any-
thing funny
  over griggs shoulder moreland could
glimpse the inert body of irene garver
she lay motionless except for the steady
rise and fall of her breasts her eyes
were closed her cheeks were wet with
tears
  you dont want to head for shore
griggs he protested well be picked
up out here sooner or later we can
stand it another day or so a plane will
be sent from cooktown or moresby hit
the coast and theyll miss us thats the
lost coast man and its full of canni-
bals theyll scoff us all mister
  the sharpened spear head bit at the
rattan bounds griggs drew back the
spear stood ready for action get to
paddling he giggled im the skipper
now and were going ashore
the frail canoe couldnt have made
it had it been ebb tide a protecting
barrier of reefs worse than any more-
land had ever encountered barred the
shore they shot through the gaps like
a bullet from a gun spray and spume

spicy-adventure stories
stinging their sunburned bodies ahead
loomed trees no land it seemed as
if the trees grew from the very sea itself
and over all hung the sickening stench
of mud
  straight into the trees moreland
plunged the canoe a flood of voracious
mosquitoes engulfed them flies and small
insects arrived to taste fresh blood
griggs cursed and slapped at his sore
skin viciously the sluggish current
seemed to follow a lane of interlaced
trees with spiral vines to tie them to-
gether huge trees stood out of the
water their gnarled roots upraised like
pawing clawing fingers a greenish twi-
light overhung the lanes and the air was
redolent with rot and decay
  griggs began to tremble and shake
take us out of here moreland he
whimpered its dead the whole thing
well die in here
  without a word moreland turned the
canoe about headed back the way he had
come it took only a few minutes of
paddling to show him how lost they
were the maze of muddy water swirled
them beneath overhanging trees that
looked exactly like others they had
passed eventually he quit paddling
  griggs screamed raised the spear
work you blighter weve got to get
out of here
  were lost said moreland calmly
the best thing to do is to drift this
muddy stream is bound to hit the sea
somewhere
  look said griggs peering toward
the trees as the boat drifted into a small
clearing look what is it 
ttive conical straw houses rose on
stilts out of the mud three more
were perilously perched in tall trees at
the clearing edge even as the occupants
of the canoe watched a bushy head ap-
peared at the door of the tree house a
bushy head in which eyeballs were roll-
ing whitely a torrent of guttural dia-
lect poured from the natives lips
  ahoy ahoy shouted griggs danc-
ing up and down waving a spear come
get us come and get us
  moreland dug in with the paddle
you fool dont you know all these
papuan natives are cannibals do you
want to be eaten
  griggs turned white pointed the spear
again at his shipmate paddle damn
you his voice was shaky with fear
as he looked back over his shoulder tiny
men were leaping from the stilt houses
others were clambering from the tree
houses all headed for dug out canoes
pygmies groaned moreland not a
one of them was five feet in height each
wore a solitary twisted garment of bark
or a single shell as their canoes started
in pursuit moreland noted that they bore
no weapons he listened to the cry
that came after them
  mammoose mammoose ropatai-
ropatai mammoose was as near as he
could make out the word each black
face was distorted in what was meant
for a smile he glimpsed pointed teeth
lips and molars black with betel nut
then he heard the mad voice of griggs
again
  griggs had clambered atop the raised
platform was dancing up and down
brandishing the pointed spear as he
mouthed curses he drew back his arm
crouched like a discus hurler
  dont throw it yelled don and
looked back at the pursuing pygmies
the canoe hit a projecting mangrove
root griggs screamed wildly tossed
the spear over the side and fell into the
water with a great splash horror-
pygmy magic

stricken don paused then saw something
that caused him to leap into action
   from the protecting shelter of the big
mangrove an enormous snout emerged
two unblinking piglike eyes were fixed
directly on the struggling body of
griggs the water rippled a little the
snout shot forward griggs saw the
huge new guinea alligator approaching
and cried out in terror moreland fum-
bled on the bottom of the boat for the
stone axe
  the beast opened its huge mouth the
stench of its breath came clear to more-
land as he clutched the axe he saw the
gleaming white tusks set in the blood red
mouth as the jaws yawned wide to rend
their living prey moreland hurled the
axe as griggs scream echoed in the
glade straight and true it sped into
the red cavern the saurian snorted
flipped on its side and disappeared leav-
ing a bloody wake
  the pygmies screamed mammoose
mammoose at the top of their voices
danced in their canoes moreland hauled
griggs aboard searched for another
weapon the axe was gone the spear
was gone his eye caught the heavy
war club he seized it turned defiantly
to the oncoming pygmies determined to
sell their lives as dearly as possible
  the tiny canoes gathered closer the
pygmies still pouring out a jargon of un-
intelligible gibberish don gripped the
club irene garver had found the knife
and stood bravely beside him griggs
cowered in the bottom of the boat
  ahoy there ahoy  the hail came
from down the turgid river don stared
unbelievingly as another canoe hove into
view for standing in the bow of the
canoe was a white man
ftthe four days that followed were like
a long delirious dream to don more-
land fever raged and burned in his
blood his abused muscles and organs
refused to function properly when he
finally opened his eyes to full conscious-
ness he stared straight upward into the
brown ones of irene garver she was
holding a gourd filled with tepid water
to his lips never before had he tasted
anything so welcome so soothing he
drank deep closed his eyes then opened
them to look about again
  no it wasnt a dream it was really
irene she wore a short native sarong
of red calico that contrasted vividly with
the whiteness of her skin as she leaned
over him to dab at his wet lips with a
clean rag the top of the shadowed cleft
between her breasts was visible the
scent of the hibiscus flower she wore in
her hair filled his nostrils he smiled
and she kissed him someone giggled
in the background
  it was a native girl as tall as well
rounded as irene she squatted in a
comer pulling the cord of a punkah that
waved above morelands head irene
smiled thats tuona toms wife
tuona this is don moreland
  the girl giggled tried unsuccessfully
to say the name
  and tom whos tom
  the white man who rescued us
honey hes a trader been inside here
for nearly a year the natives think hes
some sort of a god but-
  what happened to griggs
  her face whitened then turned red
as she looked away he squeezed her
hand
  the damned dog he grated ill
see him hanging in a dock for what he
did 
  hes mad don we shouldnt hate
him so poor fellow hes still delirious
in another hut but heres tom
hello young fellow so youve

spicy-adventure stories
snapped out of it tom andrews stood
all of six foot six in his sock feet and
weighed in proportion an enormous
red beard hung down on his thick chest
his head was topped by a thatch of hair
that matched the beard perfectly he
sat down beside dons pallet the
young lady here has told me most of
your story but maybe you can fill in if
you feel like it
ton tried he concluded with i
dont understand it andrews id
always heard that pygmies were man-
eaters but they came after us all smiles
maybe they were grinning in anticipation
of a full stomach
  andrews roared with laughter before
replying he spoke to tuona better go
see if the other fellows all right tuona
he may want water or something then
to don you can thank that red hair
for your escape young fellow every
native on this coast from the pygmies
to the tugeri think red hair brings luck
mammoose they call it theyd have
captured you if they could but they
wouldnt have eaten you theyd have
kept you so that your luck would stay
with them now the young lady and
your friend-i dont know about them
she does look sort of juicy but you
were safe
  don laughed so thats how you get
by too they figure red hair is tabu
andrews nodded that and the fear
of god ive put into them this is bad
country man im the only white man
that ever managed to keep himself alive
here theyre afraid of my puri-puri
my magic sometime ill show you im
making a good thing of it though plenty
of paradise skins from the pygmies and
a few trinkets from the tugeri and sky
people up the river i-
  the sound of a sudden penetrating
scream broke into the conversation don
tensed andrews came slowly to his feet
again that awful scream with quick
strides andrews made the door don
pulled himself up weakly assisted by
irene together they made the door
  some twenty feet away was another
mud shack exactly like the one they were
in andrews was almost there again
that scream and a struggling figure
leaped from the door only to be pulled
half in again by her captor
  it was tuona kicking biting flailing
at the man who held her head in the
crook of his arm the man was griggs
roaring with laughter maddened with
desire he had torn the sarong from
the girls brown body her breasts
bobbed and swayed pendulously muscles
rippled lithely in the fullness of her
thighs and calves as he glimpsed an-
drews running approach he hurled her
behind him crouched low to meet the at-
tack of the giant slobbering and whin-
ing
  andrews walked in slowly oblivious
of kicks and blows that bounded off his
huge body he encircled little griggs
in his arms smothered him in a brawny
embrace and walked back into the shack
with him presently he emerged the
naked bleeding body of his native wife
safe in his arms don and irene made
way for the man and his burden tuona
wasnt hurt much more frightened but
her man was grim
  hes dangerous he said as
balmy as a bat and woman-crazy dont
either of you go in there again
tays passed dragged by on weary
legs the fever burned itself out in
don moreland irene explained what
they had done about rescue a smudge
fire was constantly kept going on the
mud island and another on the coast
pygmy magic

it was tuona-kicking
fighting flailing at the
man who held her
where they had entered andrews had
dispatched a pygmy to tend the coast
fire the pygmy bore a note telling
where they were and had instructions to
give it to the first white man who came
whether he come by boat or by the great
white birds now all they could do was
wait
   moreland grew able to move about to
 get around the mud island he watched
 andrews trade trinkets for the brilliant-
 hued bird of paradise skins the little
 pygmies brought in the lumps of raw
 gold the tugeri occasionally brought
 down from the mountains once a red
 headed sky man a raiakora showed
 with a double handful of uncut rubie
 and sapphires for which andrews trade
 three knives and a quart of small nails
   but why do they fear you persisted
 don why dont they attack you and
 eat you if theyre cannibals
   andrews laughed because im the

spicy-adventure stories
thunder god don besides being
mammoose tabu im the man that
makes thunder havent you ever won-
dered what these plungers were for
against the wall of the kampong were
three plungers set in cases don eyed
them curiously i press them down
don and it thunders before i got into
this business i was a blaster down aus-
tralia way ive got plenty of dynamite

ever the cannibals get a little unruly i
set off a charge they think my puri-
puri is tops call me the thunder god
ive got it wired in the same way to my

ty-eight foot auxiliary sloop at anchor
off the island- and a real charge be-
neath the house where i live thats
just in case if they ever really got to
me where i wouldnt have a chance id
blow the whole works into the air no
cannibal stewpot for mine and ive
got plenty of dynamite and caps that
whole chest youre sitting on is filled
with it
trene grew restless as days passed
she often went to see griggs to take
him food and water which was thrust
through the bars of his cage at his in-
sistence she brought don one evening
griggs peered through the bamboo bars
began to whine
  lord love me mate youre looking
good listen im all right now ive
been mad its the fever that had me
mate you know i wouldnt do nawthing
like that if i was myself cant you
fellows let me out of here a little while
ill behave myself  ill-
  his words broke off an odd glow
came in his eyes don followed the di-
rection of his gaze tuona clad in a
scanty sarong was crossing the mud
island the firm line of her hips the
rounded boldness of her brown breasts
the trim muscularity of her thighs
griggs licked his lips sighed deeply
  don snorted and walked away but
irene was sorry for the man all un-
known to andrews or moreland she
agreed to let him out each night for
exercise his whining pleas for mercy
grated on her ears but she saw no need
to keep him locked up like a beast
  again he sent for don again the
face against the bars mate mate he
babbled were rich never mind how
i know but this andrews has got a tow
sack half filled with gems and i know
where theyre at hit him on the head
let me out and well take his boat and
beat it ill show you ill share ill-
  again don turned and walked away
in disgust that night he spoke to an-
drews about rescue
  andrews said i could take you out
moreland my boat is big enough to
cross the torres straight and make aus-
tralia at point kennedy but this is the
chance of a lifetime right here for me
im going at rainy season if they
havent sent a search party along the
lost coast by that time ill take you
give me three more months and ill be
a rich man
co moreland spent the ensuing
days idling the time away with irene
daily he grew to look forward to the
sight of her in the short sarong that was
her only garment the lush lines of her
hips were liquid thrilled him and the
day he took her in his arms thrilled to
the touch of her hot lips felt her rounded
breasts flatten against him he knew he
had found his woman
  that same evening the pygmy who
had been stationed at the coast dropped
down from the tree tops his tale was
prodigious a great white bird had de-
pygmy magic

scended from the sky to see his smoke
a man had gotten out of the bird and
came to the smoke in a boat and he
mora the greatest pygmy of all had ex-
plained that the mammoose was up the
river with the white lady he handed
andrews a note written on an envelope
it read
  we have only a small plane will
be back three days from now with a
cabin plane to take you out meet us
at river mouth where smudge was
  there was rejoicing on the mud island
that night even the red jungle moon
seemed to smile down on the happiness
irene garver felt so happy she let griggs
out of his shack and told him the good
news griggs slobbered and whined in
gratitude but kept out of sight

take them to the mouth of the river the
following morning where they would lie

peared
ffcon moreland went to sleep to

she was innocent
and young looking
-different from the
painted women of
the mining town bar-
rooms yet    was
she in with the gang
who had murdered
his partner
death
trail
don kirke stood staring down
at the water in incredulous hor-
ror it couldnt be-and yet
there was no mistaking that rusted metal
watch-band on the skeleton wrist it
was the body of his partner tom more-
land lying there stranded in the shal-
lows of little ghost river
  that thing had once been tom his
partner in the rich alluvial gold-claim
that they had discovered in the frozen
north that thing had once been alive
vital eager a boy of twenty-three bub-
bling over with exuberance and energy
now it was an almost fleshless skeleton

and it had come back almost to their
cabin door
  how far had it floated how many
weeks had it been on its way bobbing
and dancing grotesquely on the spring
flood till it had been flung ashore with
the two fleshless palms outstretched as
if crying for vengeance
  at the new year when fires could
hardly thaw the frozen gravel and work
had to be suspended tom had started
south to spend the winter with his folks
in winnipeg pack on back and the poke
of gold dust in it for the two had made
a clean-up and they had a cache in the
rocks beside the river worth many thou-
sands of dollars tom had waved from
the doorway see you in the spring
he called
and now he had returned-like this
tor hours don labored thawing out
the soil to dig a grave reverently
lie lowered the skeleton into the hole
shoveled back the earth and piled on
stones into these he inserted a roughly
fashioned cross later the mounties
would dig up the body but for the pres-
ent don had given his friends body the
sanctuary of mother earth
  back in the cabin don stood brood-
ing he was convinced that tom had
been murdered for the dust he had taken
with him and rascoe seventy miles
away where the new gold rush had
brought every evil character in the
north-west seemed the most likely


spicy-adventure stories
place where information might be had
for tom must at least have reached
rascoe
  rascoe was on the siskataway and
the little ghost flowed into it if toms
body had been thrown into the siskata-
way the spring freshets might have
backed it up into the litde ghost
  don looked at the photograph of
toms folks in winnipeg nailed to the
cabin wall a happy family group tom
had wanted don to come down and visit
them but don had preferred to keep
watch over their dust cache and the soli-
tude of the cabin there had been a girl
in his life three years before and since
she had broken faith with him to marry
a rich elderly man don didnt want to
meet people any more not the sort of
folks tom moreland had
  sometimes rarely when suppressed
nature shrieked her claims don had gone
south for a visit to some mining town
though he had never been to rascoe
which had sprung up the preceding sum-
mer then he would return with mem-
ories of a long drunken spree and wo-
men he had loved and now hated because
they hadnt helped him to forget
  don fdled a poke of dust from the
cache in the rocks packed a little grub
looked about the shack he buttoned his
mackinaw and wrapped toms scarf
about his neck toms mother had made
that scarf for him and tom had some-
how left it behind him don locked up
and hit the trail
oascoe was bedlam when don
checked in at the diggers hotel at
sundown he rented a room ate at a
fly-spotted cloth-topped table in the din-
ing-room and threw his poke down on
the clerks desk
  weigh out a hundred for me he
said
  two or three tough-looking hombres
in what might have been called by cour-
tesy the hotel lobby were observing him
rather closely don thought but dust
was the usual medium of currency and
don wasnt worried by their interest in
his poke he could take care of himself
he took the bills stowed away the rest
of his dust and stepped through the
doorway into the dance-hall
  the diggers hotel was only one of
half-a-dozen places of the same character
along the street but it was the largest
and its noise drowned out the racket
from the rest a radio was blaring out
dance-music and along the whole length
of the room which was flanked by a long
bar miners trappers and all the riffraff
cf a mining town were thumping the
floor with their heavy boots as they
swung the painted dance-hall girls
around
  at the bar men were shouting argu-
ing reeling from behind a closed door
came the rattle of poker chips and the
slap of cards
  in the doorway of a room on the other
side of the bar where three bar-tenders
were handing out drinks as fast as sleight
of hand could slide the bottles and glasses
across the mahogany stood a huge man
apparently the proprietor watching the
scene
  don ordered a whiskey gulped it
down then another and another it
was his first taste of liquor in months
and it eased the tension in him helped to
shirt out the memory of that hideous
bobbing thing at his cabin door
  then he turned sharply at a light
touch upon his arm a girl was stand-
ing beside him looking up at him with a
smile
  a little thing whose head was hardly
higher than his shoulder a dark-haired
girl with big gray eyes small firm
death trail

breasts clearly outlined beneath her sheer
frock which reached no lower than the
knee long shapely legs the contours
of slim hips and a slender waist
  the frock was scarlet making her a
striking figure in the room without
moving his eyes from her don was
aware of the hard-faced hombres watch-
ing him from a corner of the room but
he wasnt thinking of them he was as-
tonished at this girl not more than
twenty-one or two looking so different
from the painted women who were
careening round in the arms of the
miners though her face was rouged
too she had a curious look of-inno-
cence
  like that other one don reflected bit-
terly they were all the same these wo-
men
  like to dance miner she asked
smiling into dons eyes then she nestled
into his arms
ujvjaybe youd rather sit down
she suggested after they had
danced for a few minutes would you
like to buy a bottle of champagne
  don smiled and assented it was the
old game after all they sat down at a
little table and don gave the order to
the waiter bring me a whiskey too
he said
  youre out for a spree arent you
miner asked the girl she leaned
toward him and don could feel the
warmth of her as her shoulder touched
his the sweet fragrance of her came
to him like a heady perfume
  and the devils in him tugged at their
chains as he saw the beauty of her the
little rounded orbs beneath her frock
and the soft cleft between them
  my names doris she said
  you can call me mike
  mike is that your real name mike
of where
  mike of the whole damn north-
west answered don thickly lets
forget the names i guess maybe were
going to like each other but how do you
come to be playing around here 
  she laughed softly im big joes
girl she answered with a glance at the
huge proprietor oh dont look so dis-
gusted joes very nice to me and he-
he protects me you see because nobody
dares get fresh with me and one has
to live my dear
  the waiter brought the wine and filled
their glasses also the whiskey which
don tossed off first god he was begin-
ning to live again tomorrow he would
take up his quest not tonight there
was nothing he could do about tom to-
night
  but even the whiskey couldnt dull that
sense of pity that he feh for doris big
joes girl
  she leaned toward don again and he
could feel her rounded knee pressing his
own beneath the table when are you
going to begin asking me the regular
questions she said
  what questions 
  why the story of my life and how
i came to fall from a state of innocence
and what im doing here
  id like to know
  would you like me to take you some-
where 
  yes she was no different from all the
other painted women there her eyes
seemed curiously hard and calculating
as she looked into his then she smiled
again
  go out of that door and wait for me
she said i dont want to get into
trouble with big joe pretend youre
through with me-see

spicy-adventure stories
che came out of the side entrance a
minute later smiled up at him and
made him a little gesture to follow her
she led the wav along a narrow alley
toward the rear of the hotel where in-
stead of the kitchen were a number of
little rooms opening off a corridor deft-
ly she unlocked one of them and slipped
inside and don followed her
  there was barely room for two per-
sons inside and the walls were of thin
pine planking the interior was faintly
lit by the lights of the hotel shining
through a pane of glass the immediate
room on either side seemed empty but
don could hear the drunken tones of
men somewhere along the row and wo-
mens shrilling laughter doris turned
  well she asked do you want to
ask me about my past now or-later
i guess the questions can wait
laughed don drawing her to him
  the liquor made the room swim and
he was conscious of nothing but the girls
presence the beauty warmth and fra-
grance of her god what a womans
company meant even though the love
was bought after those lonely months
his hands shook as they touched her
  then her frock had fallen and she
stood before him in a short slip that re-
vealed the whole lovely contours of her
her shoulders bare one breast half re-
vealed the other threatening to slide
loose from the sheer material don drew
her into his arms and pressed his lips
hungrily to hers
  but she shivered violently and pushed
him away there was a look of fear on
her face as if she were a pure girl as if
she wasnt-what she obviously was
whats the matter
  tell me your real name and where
you come from she whispered
  why do you want to know
  just because
  oh hell im don kirke and i come
from little ghost river mumbled don
  don kirke she shuddered and
just then there came a rush along the
passage and don whirled as three men
burst in
t te dashed his fist into the face of the
foremost and sent him crashing
back against the pine partition with a
force that shivered it from top to bottom
then something hard and heavy dropped
on his skull from behind and his knees
began to sag
  he swung again and again however
connecting each time but his blows
seemed to fall as light as thistledown
grunting cursing the four struggled
in the little room and all the while don
could hear the girl screaming in the
passage but he knew that she had
tricked him for the sake of the poke of
gold dust
  again he heard rather than felt the
impact of that weapon on his head a
million lights whirled before his eves
and he passed out-cold
r i he sense of movement and the sound
of lapping waves were the first things
he was aware of when he came back to
consciousness he opened his eyes to
find himself staring up at the gray sky
in broad daylight he was lying in a
flat-bottomed scow which was drifting
down the swirling river between forests
of evergreens two men were in the
scow- with him one at the stem-sweep
the other seated at the prow
  don sat up with an effort staring at
them in bewilderment they wore the
summer uniforms of the royal mounted
the brown serge jackets and blue trou-
sers with the yellow stripe
  at his movement the man in the prow
death trail

shouted to his companion at the sweep shifted his cramped limbs and sat up
and came over to him	again leaning against a bulwark he
well howre you feeling now looked at the two mounties they had
	f		c
kirke he sneered
  water gasped don
               the faces of gangsters rather than of
               policemen
ujj
the door crashed and
three men whirled in
don tensed for the
battle
  water sure after youve talked
but don had dropped back limply for
his throat was an oven and his head
was aching as if it was ready to split
his pulses kept up an infernal throbbing
in his ears and he was as weak as an in-
fant
give him a drink charley said the
man at the sweep hell talk all right
it was only when the canteen was
handed to him that don realized he was
handcuffed he drank greedily then
  where are you taking me don
asked what am i arrested for
  its you whos taking us grinned
the man charley his swarthy features
relaxing in a leer back to that cabin
of yours somewhere on the little ghost
wed have got you next month if you
hadnt shown up at rascoe we been
laying for you there
  don realized that his belt with the
dust was gone
  i dont know what its all about he

spicy-adventure stories
said thickly i was attacked and robbed
in that hotel i dont remember any-
thing after that
  yeah well you was with one of
them women and we could take you in
for that but were dropping that charge
you were recognized and you resisted
arrest while we were being sent for
they had to knock you out he thrust
his ill-favored face into dons youre
under arrest for the murder of your
partner tom moreland he grinned
  youre crazy i went to rascoe to
find whod murdered him
  yeah sounds pretty but we got
you kirke and were taking you back
to your cabin to look for evidence
youre going to show us where it is or
itll be too bad for you because well find
it anyhow
an the third afternoon the scow pro-
pelled by oars backed up the little
ghost stream opposite the cabin
  don had expostulated argued told his
story to be met with sneering incre-
dulity and he had never met two mem-
bers of the force like charley and his
companion peterson still more repulsive
it appearance with a red thatch and a
great scar across his dirty cheek hand-
cuffed to the sweep at night he watched
the two drink themselves into a state of
roaring intoxication sometimes one of
them would offer him whiskey but don
declined
  his strength was coming back how-
ever and he had noticed that his hand-
cuffs were of an old-fashioned kind the
separate cuffs that enclosed each hand
being connected by a short rusty chain
  old cuffs-and that was curious and
a chain that was so rust-eaten that it
might be snapped perhaps if some des-
perate effort were required
  on the second night after a low mut-
tered argument between the two they
came staggering up toward the stern
where don was lying
  well feller said peterson i guess
you aint looking forward to dancing on
the air exactly how about fixing this
business
  what dyou mean
  the two looked at each other mean-
ing said peterson your partner who
you murdered had a poke full of dust
when he come into rascoe and you
had another you killed him because
there was plenty more dust cached away
which you wanted we might fix things
if you show us where it is
  so thats your game and you call
yourselves members of the mounted
its that or swing feller
  to hell with you you dirty crooks
peterson punched don in the jaw
then kicked him but charley inter-
vened no need to git rough till we git
him up there he said hell talk then
don had already instructed the pair as
to the location of the cabin
  the scow dropped her anchor in the
current opposite the cabin in mid-after-
noon don was hauled out and flung
upon the bank and toms grave was
only a few yards away the men looked
at it jeering coarsely
  so thats where you buried him is
it asked charley brung him back
by boat after you knifed him in rascoe
huh and put a cross over him haw
haw
  they roared with laughter and
swigged at their bottles again wheres
that cache cully asked charley
  find it said don
  they kicked him brutally and beat
him about the head but don remained
silent
  aw come on charley said peter-
son well find it
death trail

  don could hear them tearing up the
boards of the floor they all but tore
the cabin apart in their fury half an
hour later they came staggering out
blind with rage
  burn the -s feet till he tells char-
ley we got to get it quick before-
shut up you fool
  gawd lookit there
  a second scow was backing up the
little ghost the two men watched
cursing as it came to anchor opposite
the cabin two men got out
   lo fellers they called
   lo fellers they hailed
   lo benny lo flinders
  don recognized two of the hard-faced
hombres from the hotel in rascoe then
suddenly he understood the two men
in the uniforms of mounties were crooks
who had no right to wear that uniform
and the four were after the cache of
dust and as soon as they discovered
it dons life wouldnt be worth the
tiniest pinch of it
uwont talk huh make him
  w talk
  they dragged him to his feet knocked
him down kicked him pulled him up
again and struck him over the head with
their revolver butts
  hey let up want to croak the fel-
ler roared flinders a thickset bow-
legged man with arms as long as an
apes well roast his feet thats
sure
  say listen put in benny a pink-
eyed albino that graves where he
says he buried his partner you believe
that bunk thats the cache fellers
in a moment don was forgotten and
the four seizing picks and shovels were
busy desecrating toms grave they
drank as they worked staggered against
one another cursed as they drove their
picks into the earth which had frozen
since dons departure the sun was set-
ting don lay trying to pull himself to-
gether there was a grating feeling in
his side as if a jib had been broken and
he was still dazed from the blows upon
his head but to attempt to escape would
draw instant notice-until night fell if
the four crooks couldnt finish their job
by nightfall if they got drunker there
might be a chance   
  watch the sucker some one  roared
peterson
  don lay very still the sun was be-
neath the horizon now and still the four
were laboring at the frozen earth if
they discovered toms skeleton and real-
ized that their work had been for
nothing don guessed that they wouldnt
wait for him to disclose the secret of the
cache not fifty yards away death would
come swiftly
  his strength was coming back he
was furtively trying to snap the cuff
chain tensing his wrists and pulling but
it held rust-eaten though it was
  flinders cursed savagely as he shoveled
up the loosened earth they were some
way beneath the surface now at any
moment they might come upon toms
body
  and with death some minutes away
at most don was thinking of the girl
doris damned little stalling crook of
course shed been the bait the gang had
set for him
  no better than the rest of them but
no worse if only hed taken her in-
stead of letting her stall and racked
with pain and still struggling back to
full consciousness don saw her lovely
form again the small breast that had al-
most broken free from the slip and
cursed himself

spicy-adventure stories
then he saw another figure come
into sight along the trail that ran
beside the little ghost upon the other
side of toms grave a little limping
figure that stopped suddenly and stood
still it was doris herself
  she was still wearing the scarlet frock
but now it was a thing of shreds and
tatters her head was hatless and her
bobbed hair fell about her ears her
dress was splashed with mud and she
was bare-footed and bare-legged save
for a wisp of stocking that still clung
to one calf
  as she stopped the four caught sight
of her and simultaneously with loud
yells they dropped their picks and
shovels and ran toward her
  don saw her turn and try to flee but
in another moment she was in their
hands screaming struggling she fought
them while they guffawed with drunken
laughter the remnants of the frock
were torn from her body they pawed
at her fought over her tore the slip
from her shoulders in the bright light
that was reflected from the reddening
sky don could see her trying to shield
her soft breasts heard her gasping cries
of appeal then suddenly she collapsed
and hung limp in the midst of them
  with a bellow like a bull flinders
picked the girl up in his arms and swung
her aloft shes mine fellers see he
roared afterwards you can toss for
her keep your eyes on that sucker
kirke case he wakes up and scrams
so you walked up alone to see the boy
friend hev baby he addressed the
girl well big joe aint here now and
im going to take what i been wanting
see
  he strode with the limp form of the
girl in his arms toward the hut but
the three others ran snarling after him
they were mad drunk fighting drunk
  at the edge of the grave one of them
stooped picked up an empty whiskey
bottle and threw it at flinders it struck
him on the head and as he reeled the
girl seemed to regain consciousness and
slipped from his arms she tried to run
tottered collapsed just as the three
others were upon her
  they flung themselves at her tearing
away the rags of the slip that covered
her and leaving nothing but a pair of
gauzy step-ins she screamed again but
faintly then the man charley had
snatched her up and stumbled with her
inside the wrecked hut while the two
others followed and tried to grapple with
him
  it was a scene of hell the three
ruffians fighting for possession of the
girl and flinders reeling cursing and
half-stunned outside
rons strength had come back to him
as if by a miracle he had forgotten
all about his broken rib his aching sides
the blows upon his head he got upon
his feet and as he did so he heard an
agonizing scream from within the hut
followed by a muffled choking
  with that don went mad he tensed
the muscles of his forearms and strove
desperately to break the rusted chain
once twice and the steel cuffs bit vi-
ciously into his wrists grinding against
the bones thrice-and the cuffs flew
apart his hands were free
  he was hardly more than fifteen
seconds behind the gang when he pre-
cipitated himself into that human hell
  the cabin was a wreck half the floor
was gone carrying down toms bunk
which stood tilted sidewise upon the
ground beneath at the other end of
the cabin the man charley was holding
doris down upon the bunk and fighting
back the others her step-ins had been
death trail

tom to a few twisted rags and the love-
ly whiteness of her was disfigured with
red bruises and marred with smudges
from filthy hands she was trying to
tear one of charleys hands from her
don saw her
raise her puny
fist flash it
downward   
and there was a
knife in it
and fighting fighting and that look
upon her face was something that don
had never dreamed could appear on any
womans face the desperation the des-
pair   
  as don leaped inside the cabin he
saw bennys arm fling forward and
next instant a knife was quivering in the
cabin door within an inch of charleys
head charley never knew cursing
he released the girl and dealt peterson
a blow that knocked him to the tilting
floor where he sat mumbling oaths and
groggy-eyed and then don had sprung
  he had never fought with a knife be-
fore and under usual circumstances the
idea would have been revolting to him
now he saw in this leering beast only
a mass of flesh to be slashed into ribbons
some primeval instinct took possession
of him as he sprang
  charley turned from the prostrate
man flung out his arm-too late dons
knife went home into his throat so hard
that dons wrist was jarred by the im-
pact upon the skull behind with a
shriek charley toppled forward spew-
ing blood from the gaping wound down
through the tilted boards stumbled and
dropped
  gasping wheezes came from his throat
as he coughed out his evil life
  look out that was doriss scream
and don swerved instinctively just as

spicy adventure stories
two slugs crashed from bennys revol-
ver into the planking by his head
  don leaped and the man pulled trig-
ger again the slug grazed dons cheek
he stumbled and went down through
the broken planking tangled in a heap
with the albino
ton brought his cuffed wrists down
 upon bennys head eliciting a howl
of anguish he felt by the mans move-
ments in the darkening hut that he was
groping for his revolver six inches be-
neath him in the dirt if benny found
that gun it would be just too bad for
don but he brought down his wrists
with all his force into the mans up-
turned face twice more and felt pulp in-
stead of flesh beneath them
  then a faint scream from doris
brought him around she was struggling
now with peterson who had risen from
the floor and yet somehow don found
the time to bring down the cuffs twice
more upon the face of the thing beneath
him and heard its whimpers die away in
a last gasp of death
  he was caught in the splintered
boards dimly he could see doris still
fighting peterson and then before he
was free the great bowed form of flin-
ders sprang through the entrance and a
revolver butt crash down on petersons
skull and stretched him out senseless
  at that moment don gained his feet
flinders turned and saw him he flung
the revolver into dons face and as
don staggered with a savage bestial
cry flinders leaped at him and grasped
him about the throat with his two hands
  don beat him in the face without the
least effect his blows might have fallen
upon resilient rubber flinders hands
were about dons throat searching for
the carotids to shut off consciousness
with the trained knowledge of the north
woods fighter and in that deadly grip
don was powerless he felt his senses
leaving him again his blows grew
fainter in the darkness he could just
make out the leering animal face in-
flamed with liquor lust and murder
  then behind flinders don saw the
girl her puny fist raised to strike him
from behind and he tried to call out
to her to warn her to escape to tell her
that he was at the end of his rope but
no sound came from his throat con-
stricted till his windpipe was like a
flattened tube
  then the girls hand rose and dropped
rose and dropped again a scream broke
from flinders lips as releasing don
he tried to turn and again and yet
again-and now don panting gasping
could see the knife in it again again
until the man was a sagging dying hulk
of flesh upon the floor
  hands up all of you and come out
one by one
  that voice that rasped from the door
came from another man in mounty uni-
form beside him don could see the
huge outlines of big joe
  theyre all dead screamed doris
hysterically all dead but don kirke
oh joe god bless you and this police-
man 
  don felt the girls warm body sag in
his arms as he staggered toward the
bunk and pulled away a blanket to cover
her
phe mounty a real one this time was
gone with peterson and big joe
had departed to bring back some clothes
for doris before the corporal departed
certain things were made clear
  that gang knifed your partner
kirke and dumped him into the siskata-
way he said weve had the evidence
for weeks we were waiting to round
death trail

them up peterson will swing im tak-
ing the bodies in by scow for evidence-
and it aint what id call a pleasant job
well want you later as a witness but
i guess you wont run away
  but it was two days later before doris
sitting up in her bunk wrapped in the
blanket was able to explain during
those two days don battered -and
bruised as he was had cared for her and
nursed her back to sanity
  you dont even know who i am yet
do you don asked the girl toms
sister helen didnt he ever speak about
me
  helen of course he wanted me
to come down and meet your folks god
why didnt you tell me
  because i didnt know who you were
you see poor tom was robbed and
stabbed to death in rascoe that night
his body vanished but big joe got word
to my dad big joe was a good friend
of his years ago dads recovering from
a stroke and couldnt come so i in-
sisted on coming myself i went to ras-
coe and by pretending to be joes girl
which of course i never was i was able
to do some detective work
  i knew those men were crooks but
they pulled the wool over my eyes and
made me think the murder had been
committed by a stranger meanwhile the
police were working on the case then
when you came in that night wearing
toms scarf i jumped to the conclusion
that it was you who had murdered him
those men told me that if i could hold
you for a while theyd get two mounties
who were expected in town that night
i-i was so desperate to avenge tom
that i let you think i was-
  go on dear said tom softly
  well i thought those were the real
mounties who took you away i didnt
dream the whole four were crooks who
had murdered tom and wanted the rest
of the dust but meanwhile id learned
who you were and i was so scared that
youd try to escape and be shot dead i
started off on foot just as i was for this
cabin poor tom had often told me
where it was dear joe must have
learned and started off with one of the
real policemen and-and you know the
rest
  don seated on the bunk slipped his
arm around the blanketed figure
  helen-i love your real name dar-
ling-i want to marry you after all
this weve got to-to live our lives to-
gether will you
  she laid her head upon his shoulder
and sighed deeply can you believe
after that night that im-im good
she whispered
  im the one whos ashamed he
raised her hand to his lips precious
one im going to give you proof of the
way i honor you here you and i are
alone and im going to keep you
wrapped up from chin to toe in that
blanket till joe comes with your clothes
now do you believe i honor you
  there was a wriggling movement in
the blanket and two bare arms emerged
and wound themselves about dons neck
  it isnt-absolutely necessary dar-
ling whispered the girl because we
belonged from the first moment we met

      why couldnt the girl have told dan that she was
      his friends wife dan was willing to sacrifice his
      life for hank-even for hanks secret formula  
      and now unknowing he was about to do his
      friend the greatest injury of all   
carboy
the possibility of danger was far
from dan landons mind when he
dismounted late afternoon sun-
light filtering through the trees made
highlights and shadows on his rugged

rough-hewn features as he tethered his
horse
  he approached the little mountain
cabin just ahead the tang of septem-
ber was in the high sierra air and dan
one asiatic turned the valve the gas was
flowing into the glass chamber

of death
landon smiled it would be good to see
hank merriman again after all these
years
approaching the sprawled rambling
log shack landon noticed that the front
door was partially open he stepped
inside raised his voice hello hank
he called out
  and then he stopped bewildered
  there was a dark-eyed olive-skinned


spicy-adventure stories
girl sitting at a desk at the opposite side
of the cabins front room she had been
poring through a sheaf of papers had
evidentiy been too engrossed in her task
to hear dan landons approach but
now hearing his call she whirled around
like lightning her slender hand darted
out snatched up a heavy luger auto-
matic from the desk
  she trained the weapons ominous
black muzzle at dan landons heart
up she commanded harshly get
your hands up into the air seiior or i
shall keel you
  landons arms went slowly upward
over his head what the devil he
whispered
che was young and she was beautiful
with an exotic latin loveliness her
skin was dusk-ivory her eyes long-
lashed and slumbrous her lips were
red and kiss-inviting her hair the blue-
black of a tropic midnight
  dan landons eyes drank in the lithe
contours of her body lingered on the
magnificently-firm breasts that strained
at the confinement of her thin silken
frock her hips were ultra-feminine
her thighs were symmetrical columns of
perfect proportions her chiffon-sheath-
ed legs and ankles were slim patrician
  looking at the girl dan landon
thought of her as a splendid female cat-
animal lithe and swift and somehow
deadly yet despite this air of danger
he sensed about her an aura of invita-
tion that stirred a sudden desire within
his veins
  and then she spoke once more who
are you she demanded speak before
i decide to pull thees trigger
  with bold calmness dan landon met
her stare the name he answered
is dan landon if i have intruded im
 sorry i thought this was the cabin of
 hank merriman
   the girls dark-glowing eyes nar-
 rowed what do you want of seiior
 merriman 
    i dont want anything of him hes
 an old friend of mine i havent seen
 him in years i had a letter from him
 the other day inviting me up here to
 visit him at his mountain laboratory
 dan hesitated smiled faintly quite
 evidently i came to the wrong place can
 you tell me where i might find mr
 merriman 
    thees ees hees cabin the girl said
  slowly but seiior merriman ees not
  here he have gone to the ceety for
  chemical supplies
    gone to the city eh will he be back
  soon 
   why do you ask senor
   dan landon grinned engagingly i
 was hoping hed hurry back-so that i
 wouldnt have to stand here too long
 with my hands in the air the postures
 rather uncomfortable
    the girl took a step toward him she
 moved lightly gracefully with a sinuous
 and liquid quality to her muscles you
 say you have a letter from sen or merri-
 man inviting you to thees place ees thees
 letter with you perhaps
    of course landon started to lower
 his hands to reach into the breast pocket
 of his leather coat
the girl came closer keep the arms
up she whispered warningly me i
weel find thees letter myself and with
- her free hand she burrowed into lan-
dons coat
    the nearness of her the touch of her
  fingers upon his chest did queer things
  to dan landon he could feel a surg-
  ing wave of sensation leaping through his
  veins and her faint perfume assailed
  his nostrils like an intoxicadng and heady
carboy of death

wine he could see the beginning of the
soft valley between her enticing cream-
smooth breasts-a valley daringly ex-
posed by the low-cut neck of her frock
  for an instant the sight filled him
with an almost uncontrollable impulse
to sweep her into his hard arms crush
her against him it was a savage ata-
vistic call his desire to conquer her   
 but she held the lugers muzzle
jammed unwaveringly against his ribs
and he read grim purpose in her dark
flashing eyes she was a dangerous crea-
ture and dan landon lived for dan-
ger  which made this dark-haired girl
all the more intriguing   
qhe had extracted the contents of his
 inner pocket now she came upon
a letter addressed in the clear bold hand-
writing of hank merriman with her
one free hand she managed to extract
the letter from its envelope
 dan landon remembered the notes
contents
  dear dan
    youll probably be quite surprised to
  hear from me after all these years i have
  a mountain cabin in the sierras back of
  bit fork complete with laboratory ive
  just completed a certain chemical experi-
  ment of unusual importance-a poison gas
  wish you could manage to come up to my
  place this iveek-end id like to chin with
  you-and theres a chance i might need
  your help enclosed find a map showing
  how to reach my diggings
hank merriman
  dan landon watched her as she read
then slowly her stiffness seemed to re-
lax she lowered the luger from lan-
dons ribs and a faintly apologetic smile
came to her ripe crimson lips
 you must forgeeve me senor lan-
don she whispered i see i have make
beeg mistake when i suspect you of be-
ing an enemy she tossed the luger
back to the desk i must explain my
actions or else you weel no doubt theenk
i am a crazy person no
  landon shrugged not crazy my
dear just impetuous he looked boldly
into her dark eyes i like my women to
be that way
  she flushed a little laughed coquet-
tishly me i am lola lopez i am
senor merrimans laboratory asseestant
i have been work weeth heem een hees
experiments here
  working on the poison gas
  si yes your friend have developed
thees new formula for war gas very ter-
rible very deadly senor merriman ees
scare secret agents of other countries

afraid they come here steal his formula
when he go to the ceety thees morning
he warn me to be on guard against in-

main here and wait for heem
  if i may
  good  i weel prepare the supper and
we weel eat eet ees time for sun to go
down soon no
  dan landon nodded right and
while youre scaring up the meal ill
have a look around outside he moved
easily from the cabin walked out into
the swiftly-gathering mountain dusk
  two hundred yards away from the
house he came upon the dead man
rphe corpse was that of a huge hulk-
ing negro and the mans black mus-

spicy-adventure stories
cular throat had been sliced open from
ear to ear
  the body had been roughly concealed
beneath a bank of fallen autumn leaves
and by sheer chance a stray gust of
breeze had drifted some of the leaves
away from an outstretched stiffened
black hand
  good god landon rasped he
went to his knees swept away the leaves
until he had completely uncovered the
negros rigid mutilated cadaver
  he sprang upright raced back toward
merrimans cabin he raised his voice
harshly commandingly senorita lopez
-lola i
  the dark-eyed mexican girl appeared
at the doorway what ees eet she
spoke sharply
  come here i want to show you
something landon grabbed her arm
led her to the spot where he had made
his gruesome discovery he pointed to
the corpse look
  lola lopez paled madre de dios
she whispered eet ees christopher-
  christopher you knew this black
man 
  si-yes  he ees-he was setior mer-
rimans servant he was left here to
guard the cabin
  then merriman was correct in his
suspicions landon muttered some-
one is skulking in this neighlorhood to
steal that formula they killed this black
boy to make the coast clearer
  sangre de dios the girl wailed her
hand went to her mouth her eyes
widened and we have left the cabin
unguarded she turned raced back
toward the log shack
  landon hurled himself after her over-
took her grabbed her by the shoulders
keep away he barked ill go in and
have a look around if anyone has
sneaked in there ill handle him
   he flung the girl aside smashed him-
 self into merrimans cabin there was
 nobody to be found in the front room
 landon grabbed up the luger from the
 desk entered a smaller side-chamber
   it was a well-equipped miniature lab-
 oratory replete with retorts bunsen
 burners glass stills carboys test-tubes
 and strange-looking chemical apparatus
 but there were no traces of a prowler  
   swiftly dan examined the two re-
maining rooms of the cabin-twin tiny
bedrooms again he found nothing sus-
picious at last he went to the front
door lola-lola lopez
   the girl came toward him out of the
 deepening shadows of dusk you-you
 have find something seiior dan
   no but theres no telling when the
 man-or men-who murdered that darky
 might come back here and attack you
 and i are going to lock ourselves in
 here and wait for hank to get back
 then one of us will go for the nearest
 sheriff
   lola gave him a grateful glance i am
 glad you are here senor dan i feel
 safer
they closed and barred the doors
the windows the mexican girl
lighted a couple of kerosene lamps she
seemed nervous dan noticed that her
fingers trembled as she set fire to the
lamp-wicks
  you-you would like supper no
she looked at him
  landon shook his head not very
hungry after finding that corpse how
about you
   me i am not hongry either i-i
am frightened she confessed
 then get some rest sleep will do
 you good ill stay up and stand watch
 thank you seiior dan i-i theenk
 i will take thees advice of yours i am
carboy of death

ver tired   she smiled wanly at
him went into one of the cabins two
small bedrooms she dosed the door
behind her
  dan landon lighted a cigarette it
struck him that with the lamps lighted
the cabins interior was a perfect target
something heavy
bludgeoned down
on dans skull
for any marksman who might fire
through the unshaded windows he
puffed out the lights noticed in the
ensuing darkness that no illumination
glowed from lolas bedroom
  smart girl he muttered and he
settled into a chair in grim silence with
the luger clenched in his right fist
  hours passed then in the blackness
landon heard a stealthy sound he stiff-
ened  raised the luger threateningly
  his straining eyes perceived a white
blur coming toward him across the room
whos there he rasped
  eet ees i-lola the whispered an-
swer came i cannot sleep seiior dan
i am scare of the darkness   
  he could feel her presence smell the

spicy-adventure stories
faint fragrance of her body her hand
touched him brushed his cheek   
  you poor kid he whispered al-
most automatically his arm stole out en-
compassed her lithe waist and then she
was pressed close to him tremblingly
thrillingly with a breath-taking intimacy
that made landons heart race
  dan-hold me tight she panted
i am not scare when you hold me
  in the darkness his hands made the
startling discovery that lola was clad
in nothing but the sheerest of silken
night dresses through the gossamer
material he could sense the sweet warmth
of her body the exciting contours of her
hips and her breasts and with latin
fire she was melting against him fusing
herself against him
  somehow his lips met her open mouth
in the darkness of the cabin and he
tasted the sultry fire of her kiss lola
he whispered
  dan her answer was a panted
caress
  his arms tingled electrically about her
soft warm waist sweetly-firm satiny-
resilient was her flesh and his fingers
reveled in its warm billowing lushness
he drew her ever closer as he kissed the
hollow of her throat   
  she was quivering panting under his
caresses
  dan she gasped longingly you
weel come into lolas room no lola
is afraid and lonely   
  she was pulling at him gently  draw-
ing him toward her in the blackness
his blood was bursting in his veins his
soul was consumed with a raging flame
  then he hesitated
  lola he whispered
  si my lovaire
  are you    anything to hank mer-
riman 
  why do you ask that
  hank is my friend if you are his
sweetheart i cant   
  her lips raised to his own i am only
senor merrimans laboratory asseestant
there is notheeng between us except
that you weel not be betraying your
friend by making love with lola  
and again she pulled him toward her
tte followed her and in the pitch-dark
blackness his senses were assaulted
by the fragrance of her all-pervading per-
fume and the aliveness of her body press-
ing close to him he readied forth and
his hands encountered again her almost
naked quivering form-
  and then an electric torch smashed
blading white life blinding landon he
caught a fleeting glimpse of lola in-
toxicatingly beautiful her eyes were
wide with fear    something heavy
bludgeoned down on dans skull the
sickening bruising concussion bashed
at his consciousness sent him stagger-
ing he heard lolas cry of terror he
tried to steady himself to whirl and
grapple with the attacker who liad struck
him from behind
  even as he tried to turn a second
cudgeling smash thundered down upon
his head and then dan slumped to the
floor in stupefied unconsciousness
two little yellow men were unstrap-
ping dan from a pack-burros shaggy
back in the darkness of the night he
opened his pain-bleared eyes beheld the
asiatic faces of the men who were un-
tying him
  you rats he rasped weakly he
tried to struggle to free himself he
felt his arms being yanked behind him
as he slid from the pack-burros back
vicious savage pressure was being ap-
plied to his wrists the jiu-jitsu hold
sent lancing stabs of agony through his
carboy of death

sinews he staggered sank to his knees
  you will gain nothing by struggling
my friend a voice spoke silkily suavely
we are quite capable of dealing you
considerably more pain than you are now-
experiencing will you come quietly
  dan landon was too drunk with pain
to answer but his muscles relaxed and
he ceased to fight against his captors
foggily he tried to piece together what
had happened
  his captors were yellow men asiatics
how had they managed to enter mer-
rimans cabin and what had happened
to the mexican girl 
  as if in a nightmare-fog of unreality
dan knew that he was being taken into
a rustic house his feet dragged lead-
enly under him as he was half-prodded
half-carried down a long corridor a
door was opened before him he was
cast into a lightless room he sank to
hands and knees like a punch-drunk
pugilist his head his body his entire
being was an entity of pain
  and then out of the blackness of his
prison-chamber he heard a faint stir-
ring  a quivering indrawn breath
weakly a voice came to him-
  who is it
 for a single moment dan landon
forgot the torturing agony of his hurts
his bruises he had recognized that
weak quavering voice
 hank merriman landon gasped
out
  dan the voice whispered
t an don groped his way forward
through the darkness until he came
to a trussed helpless figure
  what in hells happened man he
panted why are you here whats it
all about
 hank merrimans answer was a
broken whisper i started for town this
morning to get supplies a bunch of
yellow devils ambushed me on the trail
they brought me to this house across
the lake from my place since then
theyve tortured hell out of me  al-
most constantly   
  but why why in gods name
theyre trying to make me give up
the formula of my new gas merriman
answered bitterly
  and youve refused
  ive held out thus far god knows if
i can stand much more of it   
  savagely dan shook his head to clear
his jumbled thoughts where is the
formula 
  i was too wise to keep it on paper
i committed it to memory it exists
only in my mind thats why they
havent dared kill me instead they
keep torturing me to make me tell   
then in the blackness of the room
hanks voice grew sharper more agon-
ized but what are you doing here
  i went to your cabin in answer to
your letter landon said i discovered
your negro servant murdered i-
god hank merrimans panted ex-
clamation was a wheezing pennon of des-
pair and what of lola my wife
   your nrife landon whispered  and
hot surging surprise flooded his numbed
mind
  yes i forgot that you didnt know
id married my laboratory assistant a
mexican girl named lola lopez shes
beautiful dan and if those yellow rats
have harmed her i-
  dan clenched his fists good god
lola lopez was hanks wife and he
had almost   
  not that it had been completely his
fault the girl had lied to him had said
that she was nothing to merriman   
nevertheless dan landon could not
bring himself to confess to his friend that

spicy-adventure stories
he had made love to lola kissed her
caressed her
  whats wrong dan merrimans
whisper was sharp with suspense why
dont you say something is-is there
something you know and wont tell me
has lola been hurt
  grimly landon uttered a half-truth
i dont know whether or not shes
been harmed hank he said slowly
she and i were locked in your cabin
waiting for you to return i was at-
tacked hit over the head and lola-
yes what of lola speak damn
you hank merrimans voice rose hys-
terically
  i dont know about her i dont know
if they captured her also or if they let
her get away
  god in heaven hank merriman
choked if they-
  his whispered words were suddenly
broken off from somewhere in the far
reaches of the house there came a wail-
ing feminine cry a cry of terror of
dread of agonized torture
ven as that terrified cry knifed the
darkness dan landon heard an-
other sound it was the grating of a
key in a lock and then the door of the
prison-room was thrown open
  three slant-eyed yellow men entered
one bore a lantern which he hung to a
jeg in the wall then swiftly they
leaped at landon trussed his hands be-
hind him
  finished with him they turned to
merriman in the lantern-light dan
caught his first glimpse of his captive
chemist-friend the sight brought sud-
den nausea to landons churning guts
  merrimans face was a mass of blood-
stained bruises his cheeks were lacer-
ated his lips puffed and split like gory
sponges and his hands-
  each fingernail had been ripped out
by the roots savagely horribly merri-
mans left foot was bare shoeless but
it did not resemble a human foot it
was crushed pulped beyond human
shape dan stared once beyond songk-
hala in the malay peninsula he had seen
another foot like that and he knew what
had caused it the so-called malay boot
a vicious sadistic contrivance of wood
and turn-screws that inflicted unendur-
able agony   
  now dan landon realized the tor-
ture which hank merriman must have
undergone in protecting his secret   
  the leading asiatic was leaning over
merriman was speaking softly silkily
  friend merriman we liave come to
you once more to ask that you reveal
the formula to us as you see we hold
the winning cards in this game you
are a prisoner we have likewise cap-
tured mr landon your friend here
moreover your lovely wife is likewise
our    shall we say guest 
  merriman writhed on the floor his
wrists were fettered helpless damn
you he panted
  if you will not reveal the formula
then we shall take certain very regret-
table steps mr merriman you will be
wise to carry your stubbornness no fur-
ther
  no no merriman grated
  very good gag him men  the asi-
atic commanded his slant-eyed followers
  in a trice a gag had been slipped into
hanks mouth and then dan landon
felt himself being similarly treated a
rag was forced between his teeth chok-
ing him a strap was passed around
his head holding the rag in place
  come bring them the leader
barked
  dan was lifted forced to walk from
the room behind him he heard mer-
carboy of death

get your hands up into the air senor or i shall keel you
rimans limping halting shuffle and
he knew the agony which every step
must have cost the chemist
they went down a corridor and at
last they came to two adjoining doors
one gave access to a lighted room dan
caught a brief glimpse of it and saw
that it was a white-walled well-equipped
chemical laboratory the second door
led into a darkened chamber

spicy-adventure stories
  put mr landon in the dark room
the asiatic leader said evenly we shall
not need him for the present
  landon was thrust into the black-dark
room which adjoined the lighted labora-
tory the door closed on him then he
beheld a thin pencil of light and realized
that there must be a door between this
chamber and the laboratory he fum-
bled toward it found it kneeling he
glued his eye to a keyhole which per-
mitted him a restricted view of the
white-walled chamber adjoining
tte saw hank merriman being hauled
into that lighted white laboratory
and trussed to a chair
  there came a feminine wail of fear
then two more little yellow men entered
the laboratory bearing between them
the struggling figure of the mexican
girl lola merrimans wife
  save for tom step-ins and shreds of
a brassiere she was naked she cast
one wide-eyed terrified glance at her
husband and there was appeal in her
dark eyes
  the leader of the gang now approach-
ed merriman my friend he smiled
mirthlessly we are about to let you
witness a little scene between some of
my men and your very desirable wife
perhaps when we have finished you
will be willing to reveal the secret of
your formula
  in the next room peering through
the keyhole and impotent to interfere
landon watched what followed it was
revolting brutal horrible
  the dark-eyed lola was thrown upon
a couch there were now five of the
yellow men grouped about her includ-
ing the leader he spoke suavely i
shall have the honor first he announced
  the others fell back then the slant-
eyed leaders hands clawed forth  pawed
at lolas writhing shoulders ran down
her arms caressing daintily her silken
skin   
  she cried out as the yellow man be-
came more savage but she was powerless
to resist his growing frenzy   
a t last the asiatic released her
   smiled at his four henchmen
well he said politely
  lola tried to scream but hard yellow
hands muffled her mouth and then a
saturnalia or bestiality followed a
saturnalia unspeakable revolting   
   and all the while hank merriman
was twisting and writhing at the bonds
which held him to his chair while in
the next room landon struggled des-
perately at the fetters which pinioned
his wrists behind him
  but landons gyves held true at last
sweating and impotent dan landon ap-
plied his eye once more to the keyhole
and stared into the white-walled labora-
tory
  he saw the asiatic approaching hank
merriman saw the chemist gag being
removed now friend merriman the
slant-eyed yellow man smiled will you
give us the formula or do you prefer
to see your wife treated to even harsher
indignities 
 hank merrimans answer was a
croaking defeated sob i-ill tell he
mumbled i would have told before you
laid hands on lola if youd removed
this foul gag
  the asiatic grinned i wanted you
to see that i meant business my friend
we orientals do not bluff as you
yankees do and now-the formula
merriman began gasping out certain
chemical combinations and as he spoke
the asiatic leader went to a work-bench
began compounding the elements as mer-
riman dictated them
carboy of death

  the process was long involved ted-
ious but at last after an hour that
seemed ages long the task was finished
and the yellow man stood before a thin
glass carboy filled with thick greenish
fog that eddied and drifted within its
transparent container
 the slant-eyed leader chuckled evilly
now we shall test the gas he spoke
softly he uttered a command to two
of his yellow henchmen
  they turned left the laboratory then
they came back trundling before them
what appeared to be a small cage of
thick plate glass
  in the next room dan landon stiff-
ened in horror good god-they were
forcing hank merriman into that glass
cage they were sealing him into it
and now through a valve they were
introducing a small quantity of that
eddying green gas into the glass cham-
ber   
  they lucre using hank merriman as
a human guinea-pig they were testing
the death-dealing qualities of the gas
upon the man who had invented it
  dan landon saw the curling green
tentacles of gas flowing into the death-
cage he saw hank merriman stiffen
struggle-and then go limp sickening
drooling trickles of dark blood abruptly
gushed from the chemists nostrils and
mouth then merriman slumped to the
floor of the glass chamber of death   
  and as merriman died the mexican
girl lola lopez suddenly burst out in
peals of amused laughter
tter yellow captors had released her
    she now stood up from the couch
grinning a splendid show she ap-
plauded we now have the formula
and that peeg of a hank merriman ees
dead our plan worked to perfection
si just as i knew eet would poor
fool-he thought that hees lovely wife
was being mistreated by you yellow
men he deed not guess that i was
how you say in league with you from
the begeening to steal his formula
  in the next room landon gasped the
whole drama had been deliberately
staged to trick merriman into revealing
his formula   
  red rage descended before his eyes
he knew that he would be next to die
the yellow men would not permit him to
live knowing as much as he did and
there was no chance of his escaping   
  a sudden plan leaped into his brain
a plan that would avenge hank mer-
riman   
  landon backed off from the door
which led into the laboratory gathered
his hard muscles bruised battered
gagged with his wrists fettered behind
him his feet were still free and in that
fact lay the core of dans plan   
  he crouched drew a deep sobbing
breath and then he hurled himself at
the door
  his shoulder bashed into the portal

          they forbade jim to fly his plane into the
          mad-womaris country but all their
          warnings meant nothing when he re-
          ceived the message written in the white
          girls blood
myneer van stent the gov-
ernor of that province of cele-
bes had told jim darrell that
no plane could across the salibaya
range and certainly not the one in
which he had arrived it was not so
much a matter of height as of a certain
rarefaction of the atmosphere due to
the alternations of blazing heat by day
and freezing cold by night
  it has been tried twice van stent
explained and told of crashes on the
mountain tops at least neither of the
planes nor their occupants had been seen
again
  but we got the pilots heads he
went on grimly neatly prepared in
the approved celebes fashton we found
them lying in the compound early one
morning mavbe the hague will send
by lew merrill
us out an up-to-date plane with a couple
of machine-guns then well wipe out
that nest of freebooters
  and he went on to tell of a secret
egress from the mountain valley by
which periodically the dyaks raided
their neighbors killing men women and
children apparently for the sheer love
of slaughter
  but this legend of a white woman
who rules them the only woman among
them-do you believe that asked jim
  thats true enough said mynheer
the governor w-ith a glance at the old
dr beyers who was seated with them
on the verandah of the government
house
  and that she was-
  an englishwoman lady-well we

her figure tottered
to their feet and col-
lapsed save her
forgivep she mur-
mured

spicy-adventure stories
wont mention names said van stent
fifteen or sixteen years ago her hus-
band a retiring british official was
taking her and their little daughter home
after his service in borneo expired
their vessel was shipwrecked off this
coast the husband and child were
massacred the woman made a prisoner
that was the last that was heard of her
until she reappeared as the leader of
this tribe
  persuaded the tribe to put all their
women to death and invented a new
religion asked jim quoting a story he
had heard at macassar and-and-
god how many of these tribesmen are
there 
  perhaps two hundred perhaps
three said the governor
 and she-one woman-
  mine friend grunted old dr bey-
ers i have seen her
jim saw a look of protest on the gov-
ernors face but beyers went on
  it will do no harm to tell now fif-
teen years ago she came to me-well
captured me with an escort of savages
with spears when i was traveling in
the interior a madwoman i should
have thought her a dyak save for her
bright golden hair the sun had bleached
it to spun gold ach gott she was
beautiful then she forced me to do
something to her a slight operation
i begged her to come back with me but
she forced me to do what she wanted
under pain of death
  i understood then the murder of
her husband and child had driven her
mad and that madness had taken a cer-
tain form she had had all the native
women killed so that she could be the
only woman in the tribe she had all
the adult males killed too murdered
asleep by the boys and her escorts were
youths of about sixteen but that was
fifteen years ago
  thus for a madwoman it was not
so difficult to create that new religion
with herself as a mother-goddess a
wife-goddess the only woman you
understand mr darrell
  but three hundred men protested
darrell
  not so difficult for her grunted
beyers not with that phase of mad-
ness a system of rewards and pun ali-
ments and the psychology of anticipa-
tion ja they are mad too i have told
mynheer the governor that when our
plane arrives they must be wiped out
like wild beasts it is immoral-amoral
horrible
  but as for your plane said the
governor it could not cross the moun-
tains and you are forbidden to attempt
it there is no oil in that region and
your commission to locate oilfields for
your american company might take you
to many parts where the natives are
orderly
avhich sounded reasonable to jim
as he made his way back to the field
where he had landed after his flight to
borneo the plane beside his tent was
guarded by six native policemen all
that afternoon it had been surrounded
by a chattering crowd but these had
melted away at nightfall
  jim entered his tent reasonable-
yes but he hadnt spoken of the mes-
sage scrawled on a dry leaf in what
looked like blood evidently from the
madwoman
  i am an english woman come and
save me bearer will show you the secret
way into the mountains
  there was a diagram of the mountain
valley of blood

range and a crude representation of the
way
  the bearer a primitive savage had
secretly handed the leaf to jim appar-
ently under the impression that he was
the chief man in the settlement he was
crouching inside the tent now like a dog
guarding jims baggage
 when jim beckoned him out he
came gibbering something in his own
language jim pointed toward the plane
he planned to get as near as possible to
the mountains thirty miles away before
descending if he couldnt top them then
hed go by the secret trail
hphe nights were almost as hot as the
days on the sea coast and the motor
started almost instantly jim indicated
to the boy to get upon one wing he
started back for the tent to get his bag-
gage
  that was when he fell foul of the
native soldiers they were not just to
guard him and his plane against curio-
sity-mongers they were to keep him
from taking off mynheer must have
shrewdly read his intentions and issued
special orders they swarmed about the
plane evidently determined not to let
him enter two of them tried to pull
the native off the wing but quick thrusts
of a previously hidden dirk made them
draw back
  jim saw it all in a flash his baggage
would have to be left behind likewise
his linen coat for it was being pulled
from his hack he sent one man reeling
with a right to the jaw drew his re-
volver held the rest at bay leaped into
the cockpit no time to adjust his safety-
belt stick forward tail up bump bump
and skip over the uneven ground for a
moment it looked as if one of the fools
would connect with the propeller
  and then the old crate had taken the
 air and jim pulled back the stick and
 gave her the gun sending her shooting
 upward at almost a stalling angle
   then he had levelled off and was
circling above the settlement and gov-
ernment house starkly silhouetted in
the moonlight and now he was heading
toward the mountains working the stick
nicely to counterbalance the weight of
the native who clung petrified with ter-
ror to his strut
   after that jim winged his way north-
 ward until the mighty range began to
 cap his horizon then upward slowly
 upward feeling his way through an at-
 mosphere peculiarly bumpy once he
 turned toward the boy and swept his
 hand out in a gesture the boy under-
 stood and indicated a mighty cliff be-
 hind which jim had already gathered
 the hidden valley lay
   upward and upward clearing minor
peaks up into the frigid air the great
cliff was not far away now but jim
would need an elevation of seven thou-
sand to clear it not much-in most
places but already the motor was pro-
testing then it conked with an ex-
piring cough it w-as through the
dutchman had been right hadnt been
stalling as jim had supposed the only
hope now was to find a landing-place in
that tangle of ravine and scrub
   the nose was pointing down the tail
 beginning to spin jim went into neutral
 and right-ruddered came out of the dive
 two thousand feet above the scrub no
 landing-place he was almost at the base
 of the great cliff itself set three or four
 thousand feet above the flats beyond the
 base of the mountains slowly down
 circling till the giant rattans almost
 brushed the fuselage
   crash into the rattans splintering
 fuselage and folding wings
  jim stepped out of the wreckage

spicy-adventure stories
snapped his thumb joint back where it
belonged and yanked the chattering na-
tive to his feet the native hadnt a single
scratch upon him
tawn was breaking as the two
emerged from the pass and saw
the long green valley stretching away
before them entirety girdled with moun-
tains unapproachable save by that track
up which the two men had labored all
night
  dawn and a sudden rush of spear-
men out of the mists and a woman at
their head a woman as brown as they
but with a crown of brightest hair that
hung down to her waist a woman of
perhaps forty years nude like her spear-
men save for a loin-clout two breasts
superbly moulded body a little fleshy
but lithe as a cats wide hips that
strained against their covering brown
legs and bare brown feet that scrambled
over the stones and thorns as if they
were shod
  no time for friendly gestures as the
first spears began to fly jim let loose
with his revolver at the crack at the
sight of their leaders falling the natives
drew back and simultaneously the
mists rose revealing a body of perhaps
two hundred crowding forward in a
thick mass
  screeching like the madwoman she
was supposed to be the woman leaped
forward and drove the spear she carried
through the natives throat he toppled
and dropped his death-cry drowned in
the gurgle of blood then the woman
had withdrawn the spear and turned
upon jim
  there was-there ought to be another
cartridge in jims revolver but jim
couldnt shoot her was it in a moment
of madness that the woman failed to rec-
ognize him as the man she had sent for
  as jim hesitated the woman leaped
two strong arms encircled him and
pressed his to his sides she grappled
with him madly her breasts flattening
against his chest one knee hooked be-
hind jims trying to throw him and her
hair a cascade of gold over them both
the grip of that woman-body took his
strength filled him with mingled loath-
ing and weakness
  then he was down and the revolver
torn from his hand helpless in the grasp
of half-a-dozen natives jim was frog-
marched despite his struggles toward
an ancient stone building that looked
like one of the prehistoric fortresses
scattered all over the east indies
  two natives came running up with
lengths of plaited rattan cord pliant
as silk strong as steel in a few mo-
ments jim was securely trussed and
helpless
yf the place had been a fort it was
  a temple too for the stone entrance
was carved with vile figures of the
hindu gods a reed curtain hung be-
fore it but it was not through the en-
trance that jim was carried through
a small doorway to one side of it and
along a stone corridor lit faintly by oil
or butter lamps then a turn the lifting
of another curtain and jim guessed that
he was in the temple
  it was a great rectangle all of stone
divided half-way across by a wide cur-
tain so that the front part was invisible
but the portion into which jim was car-
ried contained no altar nothing except
an enormous bed
  a lamp on either side of it faintly il-
luminated this chamber showing that the
bed had once been the state bed of some
dead and forgotten rajah for the four
posts were carved with the hindu sym-
valley of blood

she cut his throat while he slept because
kali had ordered it
bols of fertility mattress and pillows
-ere of plaited grasses
  jims captors flung him down and
salaamed deeply to this piece of furni-
ture knocking their heads against the
ground with curious writhings of their
bodies then at the womans crisp com-
mand they were gone and she seated
herself upon the bed beside jim and
looked at him fixedly
  i am marian curtis she said as one
who is trying to remember a half-for-
gotten language how did you come
into my kingdom 
  some instinct kept jim from referring
to the chit that the native boy had
brought him if marian had forgotten
writing it it might be as well not to re-
mind her yet
  ah i know she cried in sudden
frenzy that boy escaped and betrayed
me so you think to spy on me do you 
i have a law that is never broken all
strangers who come here die you are
only the third
  the first who found the way-the

spicy-adventure stories
young englishman crandall ah that
was long ago before they took the brains
out of the goddess kali and put them
into mine he wanted me to go away
with him and i almost yielded his skin
was white as a girls and yet he was a
man so i cut his throat while he slept
because the goddess kali ordered me to
do it
 and the second was the dutch
hunter smidt forty years old and
strong as a bull and hairy as an ape he
cried like a baby and begged me for
mercy and he almost broke his bonds
before i plunged my knife into his heart
  so you must die too but you shall
love me before i die as smidt and the
englishman did see look at me do i
not offer you a glorious gift before i
sacrifice you to the mother-goddess t
she drew herself to her full height
posing there conscious of what her
beauty was doing to him for a moment
then she had flung herself upon him
and her hot mouth was glued on jims
and he could feel her breath moist and
sweet
  love me she panted i am tired
of these brown malays you are the hrst
white man in years and years love me
if you are a man
  and she clasped him furiously to her
but now sheer pity for her left jim cold
as ice it was clear that the moment of
lucidity in which she had written that
note had been forgotten
  love me she whispered into jims
ear this is the sacred bed of kali the
mother-goddess
  jims pity changed to horror here
then-here was the center of the abomi-
nable religion that this madwoman had
invented
ouddenly her mood changed she
 sprang to her feet her heavy breasts
swaying and struck him in the face with
her clenched fist
  you refuse me she screamed is
it because you are afraid of the death that
shall come afterward i would only have
cut your throat but now i swear you
shall be tortured horribly flayed alive
and torn into a thousand pieces
  she struck him again and again with
all a mans force behind her blows until
jims lips and nose were bleeding she
drew a short wavy kriss from her loin-
cloth and held it at his throat
  then horrible laughter broke from her
lips you shall love me when you drink
the love-draught tonight she shrieked
you shall forget the death that waits
for you and think it a little thing when
the divine madness of the goddess comes
upon you lie there and dream of me
look at me am i not beautiful  but
when you drink the potion you shall
look upon me as if i were mother kali
herself
  softly sinuously she glided from the
chamber leaving jim lying there feeling
the blood running down his face
  desperately he tried to free himself
from his bonds but the flexible rattan
merely bit more deeply into his flesh
and he could not loosen them at all
trussed helpless arms bound to his
sides legs tied at thighs knees and
ankles he tried to roll off the bed and
discovered that his feet and shoulders
were fastened to the unyielding frame-
work
  the heat within the temple was fear-
ful the sweat was pouring down jims
face and body seeping into the rags that
his shirt and trousers had become after
his struggle
  hours seemed to pass no one en-
tered and not a sound was to be heard
  jim would have sold his soul for a
drink of water
valley of blood

  it must have been in the full heat of
the day when a click in the wall opposite
the curtain focused jims eyes upon the
spot
  two great blocks in the temple wall
were slowly revolving now there was
a gap and in that gap there stood a
womans figure
  for an instant jim thought it was the
madwoman come back but then faint
though the light was he saw that this
was a younger smaller slighter figure
a girl hardly a woman even
  as she came stealthily forward jim
saw that she was white she wore a
single garment of some native fibre
reaching to the knees soft girlish
breasts pressed against it from beneath
revealing their rounded contours under
the skirt the white of feminine thighs
and slender legs gleamed in the lamp-
light in her hand was a jar of water
jim drank greedily drained it let her
set it down looked at her in wonder
and suddenly understood
  you sent me that message he
whispered
  i sent hassan to find some strong
white tuan who would save me an-
swered the girl and again the words
though perfectly pronounced seemed un-
accustomed he brought you here and
they killed him you should have
brought an army
  i was a fool jim muttered
  because they killed him i shall never
forgive her though she is my mother
  your mother whispered jim in
amazement recalling mynheers story
  t am mary alice curtis and my
father was a big white tuan he was
ship-wrecked and killed and my mother
and i were captured and brought here
then she went mad and became the
ruler of these people we are the only
two women here these dyaks do not
know for sure that there are other wo-
men in the world for they are maddened
with the draft when they go out to kill
and then they kill every living thing
  my mother is the only woman they
know and so they worship her because
each of them thinks himself her hus-
band
  god muttered jim
  each night they drink the love-
draught which is made from a tree
and then she rewards her favored ones
but she was not always mad when she
was sane she managed to hide me in a
secret treasure-room and gave out that
i was dead and only hassan discovered
me he told me about the secret way
and he would have helped me escape
but i told him to seek out a white tuan
like my father i thought he would bring
an army with him for my father had
more soldiers than lie could count
you have been hidden since you
were a child 
  only my mother knows sometimes
when she ceased to be mad she would
cry and plan to escape with me but of
late years she has understood nothing
save that i must still be hidden for fear
that the dyaks will turn from her to me
and of late i think she has planned to
kill me
  jim set his teeth hard not if i can
help you can you cut these ropes he
said
  the girl bent over him it is simple
she answered no kriss could cut them
but they can be untied see now but do
not move
  her fingers moved deftly in the rattan
web for a few moments and suddenly
it loosened fell apart upon the bed jim
sat up rubbing his bruised limbs
  when will she come back he asked
  not until nightfall all day she
spicy-adventure stories

sleeps but tonight she will choose you
for her first husband and afterward the
dyaks will tear you limb from limb
  jim took the girls slender hand in his
mary alice if we can escape will you
come with me  he asked but there was
no need of any answer
as he drew her toward him the
garment gaped at the top and the
two small breasts were momentarily free
suddenly an immense reaction of emo-
tion a recklessness of the future came
upon jim if they won free she would
be his forever if not she would have
short shrift from the madwoman the
sweet perfume of her maddened him as
he drew her unresisting into his arms
  soft panting sighs came from her lips
and her whole body quivered suddenly
she flung her arms about his neck and
clung to him tautly
  i am yours tuan i was afraid of
love but now i know that it is beautiful
she whispered pressing her mouth to
his
  and later when the storm had passed
jim knew somehow that he could not
fail the gods hadnt sent him this girl
that he might lose her again even the
dread kali couldnt be so cruel as that
ttours must have passed again be-
fore mary alice detached herself
gently from her garment she withdrew
a wavy-edged kriss which she handed
jim for a moment she stood before
him in the light of the butter-lamps
elusive fragrant feminine then she
drew the sarong more closely about her
  we must wait till it grows dark she
said or they would catch us before we
reached the secret pass hide this she
slipped the kriss beneath him and re-
arranged the rattan ropes so that they
looked as if they had not been tampered
with lie still and do not let her see
that you are free she said
  and then
  tonight the dyaks will be maddened
with the love-draught and she will select
those whom she intends to honor and
after she has done with you they will
tear you to pieces such is her plan for
hassan has told me what they did to the
two other white men who came here
  then she lied to me about them
thought jim
  when she has chosen her husbands
and the rest are mad with the draught
you must choose your time cut your
way through to that wall and i shall
be waiting there i shall open it for you
if we can close it in their faces they can-
not open it from the temple side and
there will be a chance just one little
chance but do not taste the love-
draught
  youre a wonderful girl said jim
bend down and kiss me
  again his senses reeled as he felt
her warm fragrant form in his arms
and the moist pressure of her lips on his
then she had rearranged the rattan
picked up the water-jar and glided like
a wraith from the temple
rpiie noise was beginning now the
droning of many voices in a monot-
onous hoarse chant somewhere outside
and gradually growing louder and com-
ing nearer
  the sounds grew wilder the thud
of naked feet upon the earth was
audible like a buffalo stampede
wilder and wilder grew the shouting
and then suddenly the part of the temple
behind the curtain was filled with a
shrieking crowd
  above the sounds jim could hear that
of the woman marians voice
  then suddenly the curtain was pulled
valley of blood
away on either side sliding on a taut
rope of rattan and jim saw the front
part of the temple
all around the sides were the gro-
tesque figures of hindoo gods the
tallest of them stood immediately be-
fore the bed jim could see only the back
of a female figure before which was a
long flat altar and on the altar stood
marian almost nude
the native toppled and dropped his
death-cry drowned in a gurgle of blood

spicy-adventure stories
  before her all the dyaks were as-
sembled cramming every inch of the
stone temple all gazing up at her with
rapt attention and rolling eyes while
wild peals broke from their throats
  slowly the woman raised an earthen
goblet to her lips and drank from it
then each man of the crowd came for-
ward stooping to knock head against the
floor and drank from two huge fiber
pails containing the potion
  marian spoke and the hall grew still
as death the eyeballs were the only
things that moved flashes of whiteness
in the brown faces
  she was speaking names and one by
one ten of the natives detached them-
selves from the crowd and came for-
ward to the altar and a thrill of shame
and horror ran through jim as he
realized what this meant
  she waved her hand and suddenly
w ild yells rang forth and the rest of the
crowd ran leaping out of the temple she
spoke to the ten men who prostrated
themselves again and knocked their
heads upon the floor
  they rose and stood in line before
her their rolling eyes following each
movement of her sinuous body the
twitching muscles showed that the drug
had already taken effect its sensuous
effects were shown in the slavering lips
the quiver of the lithe brown forms
  marian turned and walked to where
jim lay apparently helpless in his bonds
the earthen goblet was in her hands
she placed it to his lips
  drink she said softly crooningly
drink my beloved her eyes were
hot upon his face
  w ith one bound jim had leaped from
the bed shaking off the rattan ropes
he dashed the goblet from the womans
hands he dealt her a buffet that sent
her sprawling among the slavering
brown men
  then kriss in hand he ran toward
the wall
  marian shrieked and instantly the ten
were galvanized into demoniac fury
they leaped toward jim
  but the wall was opening-open-
ing   
  jim turned the kriss flashed in the
lamplight and with a scream the fore-
most of the dyaks dropped stabbed
through the bellv jim wrenched the
kriss free the wall was open now he
leaped through and saw mary alice
standing on the other side
t tow ling like devils the nine with
marian in their midst sprang for
the aperture one leaped through and
again the kriss rose and fell and another
dyak lay at jims feet his life-blood
gushing from a frightful wound in the
throat another sprang and got wedged
in the revolving stones for an instant
the mechanism ceased then it went on
and the mangled screeching thing that
had been a man dropped in a dark mass
on the other side as the aperture closed
shutting off completely the sound of the
shrieking raving madwoman and her
companions
  mary alice was standing against the
wall of a stone corridor a little butter-
lamp in her hand the shapeless thing
at jims feet neither cried nor stirred
quick tuan quick our chance is
small but i know the way for i went
with hassan once to the very edge of the
pass after he gave me the key of my
room
  she almost dragged him after her
down a flight of ancient steps then along
a tunnel littered with great fallen blocks
of stone at last where stone complete-
ly blocked the tunnel the moonlight ap-
valley of blood

peared through an opening overhead
  jim scrambled up the rough blocks
found his head above ground stooped
and hoisted up the girl a scramble and
they emerged some hundred feet from
the extreme edge of the stone fort with
the scrub-covered base of the mountains
close at hand
  this way tuan this way sobbed
the girl
  jim stopped for an instant caught her
to him felt her breasts strained against
his and kissed her and that was the
moment of discover-
v ild tnaniacal shrieks indicated
   that the madwoman had shrewdly
guessed their course in the moonlight
jim could see at least fifty of the dyaks
streaming in pursuit
  he ran as he had never run before but
a white man hampered with boots could
hardly hope to outrun a native on his
own ground the woman marian ran
with the swiftest of the natives and
mary alice with long years of imprison-
ment behind her could hardly run at all
  already spears were whizzing past
jims head and the pass by which he
had come-he could guess its location-
was still far away
  run run jim shouted to mary
alice and then planted himself kriss in
hand directly in the path of the oncom-
ing savages
  the madwomans shrieks rose above
the din she was calling to her follow-
ers and jim guessed what she wa tell-
ing them they were to take him alive
reserve him for the torture she had
meant for him all the time
  the spears no longer flew but the
natives were coming on they were
about twenty feet away from him and
jim braced himself for the last fight
he was no longer conscious of mary
alice
  then suddenly the roar of firearms
drowned the yells the front rank of the
natives melted away firearms no a
machine-gun manned by half-a-dozen
brown men under command of a white
bearded officer
  again again those staccato blasts
ripped through the air the savages had
turned to flee but there was no flight for
them swiftly inexorably as a reaper
inows they were cut down until the last
man dropped among his companions on
that bloodstained field
  only one figure tottered to jims feet
and collapsed there it was marian and
the whole upper portion of her body had
almost been blown to pieces
  save her forgive she whispered
and sobbed and died but the madness
seemed to have been gone from her face
  jim swung about to see mary alice
in the grasp of the white officer he
was leading her toward jim jim re-
cognized the face beneath the white sun-
helmet it was that of mynheer van
stent
uttnd so you outwitted us you
   thought eh  grinned the dutch-
man a little later as jim sprawled upon
the ground at the head of the pass he
was feeling better distinctly better with
a bottle of champagne ice-cold from the
thermos flask into which it had been
emptied inside him and much better
because mary alice was seated beside
him and her hand was in his own
  id seems to hat been even worse
tlian i expected continued heer van
stent and if i had let you go to your
death your government would have
raised hell with mine government and
i should have been recalled but wk

sight between his ears to get the focal
point of his gaze gradually i make out
the black head against the white foam
of the breakers a swimmer is strug-
gling against the swift undertow the
damn fool he ought to have known
better than to go swimming there
  i make a peculiar sighing sound be-
tween my teeth and pepito sprints for-
ward down the road like the devil is
after him in two minutes he is labor-
ing across the soft sand of the beach
toward the figure struggling in the crash-
ing surf at the beginning of the steep
shingle i draw him up and leap from
the saddle i am waist deep in the swirl-
ing water before i manage to grip my
fingers in the dark hair of the head that
is being swept out once more by the
powerful undertow
  i give the short hair a sharp tug
catch the slight figure in my arms and
start running up the shingle i say run-
ning but the undertow is so strong
against my legs that my feet feel like
the lead weights of a divers suit
  it is the impact of the next breaker
that bowls the two of us over and rolls
us up the hard packed beach like a
couple of interlocked tumble-weeds i
manage to struggle to my knees in time

spicy-adventure stories
to catch one of the swimmers feet as
the current starts dragging back in an-
other moment we are safe above the
water line and i look down at the figure
im dragging so informally by the right
foot i can feel my eyes bulge with sur-
prise it is a woman
  she is stark naked except for a scant
dance set the pink silk panties cling
to her curves as if they are painted on
the lace brassiere is askew leaving one
lovely bulb-like perfect breast almost
bare in the light of the moon the flat
white stomach rises and falls seductively
with each breath hanging from a silver
chain between the alluring breasts is an
oblong metal tube
tlropping her foot suddenly i
kneel beside her and brush back the
short boyish hair i give a grunt of sur-
prise it is petra at that moment she
gives a deep sigh and opens her eyes at
me
  pense que yo puedo nadar she mur-
murs
  youre a good swimmer petra but
nobody coidd fight the undertow at this
point you ought not to be swimming
out here alone
  lifting her arms she locked her hands
behind my neck and draws herself up
thanks for saving my life sangre
  dont mention it i needed a bath
anyway
  she sticks her lips up close to mine
and turns them out a little exposing
their velvet inner surfaces
  im terribly spent sangre if you
kissed me i couldnt resist
  a warm aroma arises from the per-
fumed valley of her pale breasts my
nostrils tingle
  petra if i kissed you now i couldnt
resist
  with a quick tug she pulls my head
down her hot wet lips fasten over
mine a sort of moon blindness blurs
my eyes i struggle to my feet but she
comes up with me without releasing her
hold i feel her round soft breasts
against my chest a sharp jagged thrill
gnaws along my spine a flame flicks
back and forth across my lips i throw
my arms around her and pull her to me
my temples throb
  after a while she says youre hurt-
ing me
  it isnt me its that gadget youve
got around your neck its gouging me
too
  oh   she pushes me away and
quickly unhooks the long metal tube
from the silver chain take it quick
sangre its for you i swam in with it
from the boat number  couldnt meet
you they got him this afternoon after
he sent you the note
  i shake my head and say why didnt
you tell me right away
  i grab the waterproof metal tube and
unscrewing one end slip out a small
oblong pasteboard box wrapped in a
piece of white paper i unwrap the
paper on the label of the box it says
specific no  on the paper it says
in code
      yellozv bulldog lying off
      watch for flying fish dog
      meat arrives pic twelve
      and half gel wrapping poper

   dog meat   whatever ship is
waiting for   arrives pie de la cucsta
at twelve-thirty    get the papers   
but let the messenger go through
  i hold my wrist watch to my ear to
see if my watch has survived its sudden
blood has sticky fingers

bath it hasnt the hands are stopped
at eleven thirty-five
  you little so and so i say grabbing
petra by the arm and rushing her
toward pepito if were too late old
hardhead will court martial us both
  as i am hoisting her up behind the
saddle a peculiar snort from pepito
makes me hold my breath i listen
there isnt a sound but the ocean
pepito is looking up across the lake be-
hind me then i see a silver spangled
bird swerving above the lake the
breath hisses between my teeth it isnt
a bird it is a seaplane that has come
down from a great height with a dead
motor  to avoid noise
  in a moment it has disappeared below
the edge of the dense growth of mangles
along the edge of the lake i hear its
pontoons splash against the smooth wa-
ters of lake coyuca that plane will
be from the warship that pilot will be
waiting for the messenger
tjraying that the pilot hasnt seen
us i vault into the saddle mutter
hang on half pint and head across
the sand back up the road toward
acapulco if i can only make the tunnel
before the messenger arrives when we
reach the top of the grade i send pepito
at a swift trot around the winding car-
retera toward the tunnel we slow down
to a walk as we go through the first cut
and gradually increase our pace again
until were going at a full gallop as we
pass the wave-lashed rocky inlet thats
known as the devils fronton
  petra speaks suddenly in my ear
are you going to use whats in the
box 
  how the hell do i know i growl
i dont know whats in the box its
code-marked specific no  but ill
have to look it up to see
  i can see the tunnel two turns ahead
old hardhead said you would know-
how to use them she is hugging me so
tightly to keep from falling that i can
feel the hot round pressure of her lusci-
ous breasts against my back her breath
is warm in my ear he said youd used
them once before
  hes crazy ive never used anything
he sent me but once before    saa-ay
wait a minute    did he tell you whats
in the box 
  yes    cataleptic bombs  i was
almost afraid to dive off the boat for fear
theyd explode and blow me to bits  
  i laugh heartily as i draw rein at the
entrance to the tunnel theyre not that
kind of bombs    listen half pint
ive got a hunch this guy were waiting
for wont stop when we ask him to he
will be in a car with headlights too
bright for good shooting we havent
got time to cut down a tree and there
arent any loose boulders big enough to
stop him   
  but interrupts petra slipping off
pepitos rump you think hed stop of
his own accord if he saw a young lady
without any clothing on lying in the
middle of the road   
  exactly any man would and com-
ing through the tunnel hell be going
slowly so that  
       he isnt likely to run over me
all right if you want to take a chance
on losing me i guess i can take a chance
too
  without another word she lies down
catercornered in the moonlit road just
outside the mouth of the tunnel she is
lying on her side with arms sprawled
above her head her breasts stand out
like pale mounds of ice-glazed snow
firm proud unashamed the gentle
curves of her slender waist climb the

spicy-adventure stories
gentle hill of her hips and fade seduc-
tively behind her moulded thighs
  i lick my lips petra i say youve
got guts
  i lead pepito off to one side behind a
bushy rosal in full bloom in a moment
i have extracted three colorless glass
pellets from the pasteboard box now
that i see them again i remember them
well old hardhead only used them as
a last resort because he prizes the for-
mula too highly his instructions are
if you dont use them destroy them in
an enemys hands they are your death
and disgrace
  slipping the glass pellets into the side
pocket of my coat where theyll be ac-
cessible i pull the rod from my shoulder
holster break it and spin the cylinder
just to see that the salt water hasnt
gummed up the works
tvte dont have long to wait all
of a sudden i hear the soft purr of
a powerful motor and a vivid streak of
white light flashes along the right wall
of the tunnel as the bright beams pick
out the prone body of the almost naked
girl i resist a terrific impulse to shout
at petra to jump out of the way i may
have figured wrong what if this driver
doesnt see her or is too ruthless to
stop emptily i imagine my state of
mind if i were lying in that beam of light
in front of that oncoming car the light
on the wall grows brighter the purr of
the motor becomes a roar the headlights
swoop into view my mouth opens to
cry out involuntarily i start to leap
forward   
  there is a sudden screech of brakes
and the dry rasping sound of tires skid-
ding on gravel my heart unplugs my
throat and sinks back into its cavity as
i sink farther back into the shadows
the long sleek nose of a black car stops
within six feet of petra for a moment
nothing happens as if the driver is think-
ing over the situation pondering if it is
a plant then as if finally convinced
a slender man in a grey suit and felt hat
steps into the bright swathe of head-
lights and stoops over the girl
  with a quick movement i slip a glass
pellet from my pocket and taking care-
ful aim toss it to the hard gravel beside
the bent over figure the pellet breaks
with an almost inaudible tinkle a puff
of pale smoke bounds upward envelop-
ing the mans head the bent figure
stiffens like a self-conscious laborer pos-
ing for his first photograph
  waiting for a precious moment to be
sure that no one else is keeping watch in
the car i step forward and bending
over slip my hand into the inside pocket
of the mans coat removing a brown
envelope i run rapidly through the con-
tents by the beam of a headlight with a
terrible sinking feeling i replace the
papers in the envelope and return it to
the inside pocket extracting with the
same movement a large brown wallet
this contains numerous bills of large
denominations a passport with an un-
recognizable picture and a pink card
with strang black characters nothing
else
  by now i feel as low as a snakes
belly  shake my head dismally if i
have to search the car for them its go-
ing to be a mess perhaps if i take too
long a bloody mess
t slip another glass pellet from my
pocket and drop it on the ground
beneath the taut bent figure then
rapidly i walk to the car i could shout
for joy on the front seat where it has
sat beside the driver is a small leather
brief-case with a zipper top i strip the
zipper back and hurriedly removing the
blood has sticky fingers

myself     pesos sil-
ver in full payment for the peninsular
state hounded on the south and east by
the gulf of lower california on the
west by the pacific ocean on the north
by the state of california of the united
this is a stick-up i say
keep your hands away
from your pockets
contents take them into the light in front
of the car in a minute i have found the
document
  it is on white official paper signed
and sealed with the red governmental
stamp i am amazed at the appended
signatures a swift glance at the con-
tents makes me gasp at the magnitude
of the transaction and the colossal cheek
of the nations involved i read the long
row of figures over twice to convince
states of america   including full and
exclusive dominion over magdalena
bay   
  i whistle to what lengths a nation
will go to obtain good harbors mag-
dalena bay the finest harbor on the
west coast of north america big
enough to house an entire fleet in safety
no wonder old hardhead came to
supervise this thing himself
  abruptly i return to the car and re-

spicy-adventure stories
place the other documents in the brief
case closing it once more with the zip-
per then i leap back to the side of the
road where i had been hidden and stand
gun in hand waiting for the termination
as suddenly as it began of the super-
ficial catalepsy each cataleptic bomb
is strong enough to produce superficial
catalepsy for a period of five minutes
on any living being within three feet of
its explosion the mind of the cata-
leptic records nothing that passes during
that time and resumes activity at the
point ou which it ceased
  at almost the same instant petra and
the bent figure resume consciousness
petra sits up with a realistic groan her
magnificent breasts swaying to the
rhythm of her torso the taut muscles
of her stomach contracting and relaxing
spasmodically the man dropping on
one knee speaks to her in a peculiar
sing-song spanish that is difficult to un-
derstand
  i speak sharply in mex    this is
a stick-up he jumps to his feet one
iand diving for his hip keep your
hands away from your pockets   
thats better i can see his face now
with its broad nose and slanting eyes and
i remember the strange black characters
on the pink card now toss me your
pocket book and if tlie contents are
satisfactory you can be on your way
  with obvious relief he hurriedly delves
within his coat and brings out the
large brown wallet that contains so many
bills i see petra step back into the
shadows as i make a pretense of count-
ing the money
  quitatef i command motioning
ominously with the gun barrel
  he doesnt wait for a second invita-
tion but leaps into the car slams in the
gears and roars away in a swirl of dust
and gravel toward lake coyuca
tolling the document into a small
roll i fit it into the waterproof tube
that petra brought the bombs in and
screw on the lid at that instant petra
comes walking out of the shadows of the
tunnel her moon-tipped breasts bounc-
ing with each step her lorely hips sway-
ing seductively
  success and flowers she says stand-
ing close to me and breathing deeply so
that the firm pale breasts rise like white
doves about to take wing
  dont be premature i say wait
till he starts to turn over that brief case
to the pilot of tlie seaplane that son
of confucius will roar back miles an
hour thirsty for blood
  no he wont says petra calmly i
opened the petcock on the gas tank
in a burst of enthusiasm i throw my
arms about her and crash her to me
planting a long kiss on each of her white
shoulders her warm body sinks against
me then suddenly over her shoulder
i see a spark of yellowish light winking
at me it is the riding light of old
hardheads fishing smack the port light
flashes once i thrust petra from me
  sorry half pint i say business
before pleasure were not out of the
rough by a long shot dont you hear
that seaplanes motor
  from my vest pocket i extract a flat
piece of cut crystal holding it up into
the full rays of the moon with my right
hand i pass my left hand back and forth
across it in swift but definite movements
after a moment the riding light stops
winking the port and starboard lights
flash on and i can see the boat move
forward i hand petra the waterproof
tube she automatically hooks it to the
silver chain around her neck the roar
of the motor is louder i can see the flash
of the moon on a plane above lake
coyuca its heading this way
blood has sticky fingers

  when old hardhead sails as close
to the rocks as he can come that green
light will go out then youll have to
swim for it take the first hogback be-
yond the tunnel it has a sloping point
and you can take off without breaking
your neck beat it here they come
che has hardly hit the shadows qf the
tunnel on her way through when the
plane swerves above me i am mount-
ing pepito when it dives something
bright drops with a sickening swish
there is a blinding flash a roar like the
blast of krakatoa the road rocks be-
neath pepitos trembling feet the tun-
nel mouth yawns once spits forth a
poisonous cloud of gas and dust and
with a grating snarl collapses like the
jaws of death the plane zooms upward
again
  holding the quivering pepito in check
i dare to think of petra did she make
the other end of the tunnel or was she
crushed beneath that mass of falling
rock  my stomach comes up i am
sick
  i hear the roar of the plane as it dives
again i whistle shrilly in pepitos ear
he leaps forward and down the winding
road like a streak of red lightning be-
hind me i feel the hot blast of another
blinding flash my ears ache to the pres-
sure of the explosion i look over my
shoulder the road where we had stood
a moment before is gone in its place is
a gaping chasm i reach over and pat
pepitos straining neck
  if she got through old boy shes
safe its obvious theyre not after her
theyre after us
  high ahead i see the plane banking
for another attack just as the nose tips
for the dive i swerve pepito off the car-
retera behind a huge granite boulder i
whip out my rod and fire three shots into
the fusillage as the seaplane thunders by
the flash of the third bomb almost
blinds me pepito rears up nearly un-
seating me the giant boulder trembles
and rocks like a thunder-bolt has struck
it but it protects us from the fusilade of
flying stones
  pepitos eyes are rolling in panic as i
edge him around the gaping crater in the
road the instant i loose the reins he
bolts forward down the carretera toward
the beach like a mad pegasus i am hop-
ing we can make the sheltering recesses
of the palms and mangroves near the
lake before the plane returns
  suddenly i hear a fourth explosion
i look backward i can see the flash it
is on the hogback the other side of the
tunnel theyre after petra that
means that she escaped the collapsing
tunnel if only they dont get her now
   i utter a silent prayer
as i draw pepito up in the shadows
of a clump of spanish daggers i see
the great flying fish zooming in a wide
bank out over the ocean then i see
the reason old hardheads fishing
smack has closed in almost to the coast
in answer to my signal crystal theyre
going to bomb the smack that means
old hardhead goes    and maybe petra
too they dont mean to stop until they
get those papers or destroy them
  with that terrible empty feeling that
comes when you see a tragedy about to
happen that you are helpless to prevent
i watch the seaplane dive it is headed
swift and sure for the squatty little boat
when it seems that the nose of the bird-
of-prey must almost touch the tiny mast
i see the flash and hear the mighty roar
then another and another in quick suc-
cession 
  the seaplane seems to pause in its
       continued on page

   veying transit pointed
   through the jungle
   that ivas what met
   bush wymans eye
bush wyman straightened up
his six feet of sinewy body from
his transit and jerked a bandana
handkerchief from a pocket he mopped
the perspiration from his sun-tanned
face and looked along the straight
cleared path that his crew were cutting
through the jungle
   he stooped and placed his liard gray
 eye to the instrument again his muscles
 tensed through an aperture in the
 verdure the gleaming figure of a girl on
 horseback flashed before the lens vy-

flaming a rrows

 man swung the barrel of his transit
 tried to follow the apparition the
 matted vines cut off his view then he
 saw her again as her black mount picked
 its way across the field of his vision
 bush wymans blood surged the girl
 on horseback was practically nude
   the telescope brought her close she
 had reined in her horse and was looking
 in his direction every detail of her
 glorious youthful body stood out clearly
 against the green background her
 slender body glowed with the whiteness
 of marble her thighs clear-cut over
 the black steed were as matchless as
 sculptured alabaster her breasts would
 have done justice to a statue of venus
   her hair was golden wavy like the
 autumn wheat wyman remembered back
 home in the states and then as he


spicy-adventure stories
stared breathlessly the girl jerked the
reins with her rounded arms horse
and rider were swallowed up among the
giant orchids and trees
vvtyman stood up gazed toward
where the girl had disappeared
suddenly his body went rigid some-
thing vivid like a fiery eye whirred
through the jungle leaves it came with
the speed of a comet bush wyman
ducked the flaming object whizzed by
his ear he turned looked toward the
corral behind him a burro reared on
its hind legs pawed the air with its
front hoofs whinnied and fell to the
ground
  a stableman ran to the fallen animal
the mans eyes bulged he turned an
ashen face to wyman shouted my
god look at this wyman strode to
the fallen burro it was dead
  see what killed him the stableman
asked
  wyman stooped half the length of
an arrow was embedded in the animals
chest the forward end of the weapon
had been smeared with asphalt set afire
before it had been sprung from the bnw
the portion of the shaft projecting from
the beast terminated with a red feather
  indians the excited mule-tender
exclaimed none of us are safe in this
damn jungle
  wymans sharp eyes saw a wrapping
near the feathered end of the arrow he
opened his pocket knife cut the fine cord
that bound it to the cane rod it was
a small square of white linen paper on
it there was a message written in eng-
lish on a typewritten it read if you
do not want to meet the same fate as
your burro come no farther there
was no signature
  bush wyman handed the slip of paper
to the startled man beside him vene-
  zuelan indians dont use english so
fluently joe he told him neither do
they have typewriters
  he took a map from his field book
spread it open see here he pointed
this is lake maracaibo at the south
end of it is where we unloaded the mam-
moth oil company outfit from the
steamer we have to get the machinery
through the road were building wy-
man traced his pencil lower inland
this round circle is the asphalt bed
reported by the airplane survey we
expect to find oil thereabouts
  so what joe wanted to know
you remember that other gang-the
shale oil company they started two
months ahead of us took another
course
  joe nodded
  its my hunch theyre trying to
throw a scare into us hold us back until
they file on the property themselves
and send a note like that joe
asked it dont look i ke the real thing
if they want to make us think its in-
dians
  wyman hunched his shoulders that
dead burro is real enough he left the
burro keeper went to the forward end
of the cleared line where the crew was
hacking at the rank vegetation he
spoke to the foreman go back and run
the instrument for me this afternoon
im going to do a little scouting ahead
okay chief
yman picked up a machete went
forward to the end of the cleared
trail he plunged into the thickness of
the jungle followed a narrow stream
huge pitcher plants slapped his perspir-
ing face he slashed at them with his
blade hacked at their tough stalks tore
through the towering ferns as he trudged
along the ravine
queen of the flaming arrows

  gay-plumaged macaws chattered in
the mangrove trees above him monkeys
with grotesque white faces gibbered
from the branches the curious bell bird
sounded its solitary note a single ring
like a gong
  monstrous bats sailed toward wy-
mans head he struck at them they
darted upward screeched with a sinister
sound fat frogs croaked jumped into
si my holes under wymans feet he
plodded on
  his mind dwelt on the girl lie had
seen through the telescope of his transit
that she had something to do with the
death of the burro he was certain may-
be the rival oil company had used her in
a scheme to frighten his men could she
be a white indian wyman had read
of such a tribe that lived in venezuelas
interior
  slic ng at the matted vines ripping
into the interlaced barrier that was like
woven wire bush wvman reachcd a
clearing he sat down on a mossy rock
he found a damp cigarette paper in his
pocket rolled some tobacco into a cylin-
der and lighted it he blew a fog of
smoke into the still air
  abruptly wyman crouched sprang
to his feet something had swished the
air behind him wyman wheeled he
faced a man whose descending arm
wielded a club in that split second wy-
man raised his machete the bludgeon
crashed on the blade the outer end of
the club was lopped off but the portion
that remained in the mans hand fur-
rowed down wymans chest tore vici-
ously into his flesh
  wyman winced felt the rapsing pain
of his lacerated skin he plunged at his
attacker raised his blade brought it
down on the mans skull his oppon-
ents head split like a cocoanut
  wyman stared at the man he had
killed a white indian he gasped
the native was bare save for moccasins
and a breech-clout his hair was like
coal his cheek bones high mouth large
and sensual
  yells split the air as wyman backed
against a big tree he shifted the ma-
chete to his left hand and jerked his
revolver from its holster it seemed as
though every rock had come to life
heads and shoulders of white natives
appeared everywhere
  wymans gun spewed fire cracked re-
sonantly through the canyon an indian
slumped behind a ledge bush wymans
weapon spat flame at the uncoming
horde then the hammer of his revolver
snapped uselessly against an empty shell
he jammed the gun back into its hol-
ster and raised the machete as the white
indians closed in a semi-circe about
him
    giant of a man stood out in their
    midst watching his tribesmen an
indian took an arrow from his quiver
the giant sprang to the native jerked
the arrow from his hand threw it to the
ground the native made no further at-
tempt to use his deadly darts
  like a soft-footed puma another
white brave advanced wyman waited
until the man was in striking distance
and then slashed with his uplifted ma-
chete the indian sidestepped the de-
scending blade wyman stumbled from
his own momentum went to his knees
he scrambled to his feet punched out
with his left fist it landed on the jaw
of the native the man dropped back-
ward into the muck
  wymans machete cut the air as an-
other indian approached but the power-
ful hands of a man from behind clamped
his arms kept the long knife from fall-
ing the throng of yelping natives

spicy-adventure stories
closed in pinioned his legs wyman
was dragged to the earth
  with lightning swiftness the indians
jerked wymans arms behind him
native rope was tied around his wrists
he was pulled to his feet stood be-
tween two muscular men they held the
points of their javelins against his sides
the giant indian who seemed to be the
leader came up to his captive he took
the cartridge belt and revolver from
wymans waist
  and then to bush wymans amaze-
ment the leader spoke in english fol-
low me he ordered the big native
started forward wyman was prodded
into action the two guards hugged
closely
  bush wyman was led over a trail
through the forest they cut across ar-
royos plodded over knolls sloshed along
the soggy bed of a stream at last they
climbed a precipitous rise reached the
top halted wymans eyes swept the
valley below it was a cleared area
under cultivation in the distance a
village sprawled thatched-roofed huts
squatted in winding roads the band
descended the hill
  wrinkled old men stood with open
mouths naked children gaped squaws
stared as the band reached the village
and passed along its narrow street
from doorways hung with matting
young girls white-skinned peeped out
shyly wymans blood quickened as he
caught glimpses of their flashing thighs
their nubile breasts and lithe bodies
at the far end of the road the
leader who had spoken english
stopped a large structure of bamboo
stood back from the street it was a
two-story house the upper section
projected over the first story and had a
veranda that skirted the entire building
brightly-colored flowers and pampas
grass grew luxuriantly in the garden
  the giant leader looked up toward the
veranda wymans eyes followed his
gaze a door opened a girl walked to
the rail of the portico she was nude
except for a girdle of dried twisted
flowers and a necklace of fresher blos-
soms that sheltered her breasts her
whole body was a symphony of breath-
taking loveliness golden hair caressed
her curving shoulders wyman gasped
it was the girl he had seen through the
telescope of his surveying instrument
and she wrs not an indian
  the girl stared steadily at wyman
she spoke something in the native
dialect the leader of the indians bowed
as she went back into her room he
gave an order to his tribesmen they
turned left the giant chief clapped a
hand on wymans shoulder gestured
toward the outside stairway captive
and captor entered the blossoming
grounds wyman went up the steps
  he was led to the other side of the
veranda it overlooked a vast plain
shining in the late afternoon sun a black
lake of asphalt glistened the big native
motioned to a crude chair bush wyman
sat down
  with the smoothness of a white swan
the golden-tressed girl appeared from
another doorway she walked to where
wyman sat on the edge of his chair
her azure eyes surveyed him from un-
der long lashes every detail of her
lissom body was now within his reach
her breasts rose and fell with a fascin-
ating movement her rounded shoulders
were a perfection of curves that swept
gracefully to her perfect waist
  she sat down in a reclining chair op-
posite wyman and clapped her palms
together a white indian girl came out
onto the veranda she too was nude
queen of the flaming arrows

veranda and disappeared through a door-
way the white indian girl picked up
a palm leaf waved it over the golden
head of the reclining girl the blonde
riveted her blue eyes on her captive
save tor a wispy girdle the native girls
breasts were pear-shaped and drooped
slightly her dark eyes bored at wy-
man a hibiscus blossom was entwined
in her coal-like hair her crimson lips
parted in a smile
  the yellow-haired girl spoke to the
giant native alongside of wyman the
big native turned walked across -the
wyman was too late the
flaming arrow flew straight
for tatinas breast

spicy-adventure stories
she spoke so mr wyman you didnt
heed my message
  wyman straightened jumped to his
feet i dont just get this set-up he
flared but if the shale oil company

widened is that what you think

civilized greed

  the girl who had called herself mar-
jorie packard spoke to the dark-haired
girl release him tatina
rthe white indian maid went behind
wyman her fingers picked at the
strands that bound his wrists her warm
body was close to him he felt soft skin
brush his back heard her deep labored
breathing at last she freed his arms
from the bonds
  the golden-haired girl spoke to tatina
in the indian tongue the maid arched
her brows and left in a few minutes
she returned with a pitcher and clay
cups filled them handed one to wyman
he tasted the drink smiled and downed
it marjorie set her cup on a low table
  you may go now tatina the blonde
girl said sharply the dark-haired maid
left
  alone with marjorie packard bush
wyman drew his chair by her side he
feasted his eyes on her beauty how
long have you been here he asked
  i was born here marjorie answered
my father was an anthropologist my
mother died first before my father
passed away he made me promise to go
to the states to be educated i did
and why did you come back here
marjories eyes flared because 
was sick of your civilization your greed
deceit here we are free peaceful i
learned of you and your oil company
you are coming here to destroy our
homes our farms put up hideous der-
ricks  drive us away
  but my dear im afraid you cant
stop progress by shooting arrows at us
marjorie didnt reply she looked help-
lessly at wyman he saw her eyes mist
he dragged his chair closer put his hand
on her shoulder the contact with her
bare flesh made tingles shoot through his
veins he felt the girls body tremble
saw the color steal over her face he
leaned over her put his other arm around
her glowing body
  the golden-tressed girl gasped slow-
ly her arms crept outward circled his
body wymans head lowered impul-
sively feverishly his mouth clamped
over her moist ruby lips lingered hard
  abruptly she twisted from bush wy-
man sprang to her feet her white body
was flushed pink her eyes flared you
shant do that to me she flared i
wont permit it once in the states i
trusted a man like you thats why i re-
turned here she clapped her hands
the giant indian and the native girl
tatina came back to the veranda
  marjorie snapped an order the in-
dian chief thrust the tip of his javelin
close to wymans chest put your hands
back of you he commanded wyman
queen of the flaming arrows

obeyed tatina went behind wyman
she securely rebound his wrists
  the golden-haired girl gave another
order the big indian prodded wyman
toward the stairway wyman looked
back at marjorie she stood like a statue
motionless expressionless
rman descended the stairs to the
garden below the indian chief at
his heels another tribesman joined
them wyman was marched down the
road toward the shore of the asphalt
lake they came to a log shack set
among the trees the chief pulled open
the portal thrust wyman inside he
pointed to a cot wyman sat down
while the giant indian held his spear
against wymans side the other native
bound his ankles the chief and his
tribesman left wyman heard the slid-
ing of a timber on the outside of the
door
  he put his eyes to a chink between
the logs of the wall beside his cot  he
fiery edge of the tropical sun was drop-
ping below the horizon of the asphalt
lake he looked at the meager furnish-
ings of the room he strained at his
fetters the ligaments of his muscles
stood out like thongs but the fiber bonds
held
  blackness gradually enshrouded his
prison not a sound broke the stillness
the air was dank sweat streamed into
his eyes from his futile efforts to free
himself a listless sensation stole over
him he shook his body tried to free it
from a lethargic feeling that was over-
powering him a gray haze was swim-
ming over his eyes in the darkness lie
felt drowsy his shoulders slumped
vainly lie tried to hold open his flutter-
ing eyelids but they were heavy like
velvet curtains and closed
tush wyman awoke from the sound
of a grating noise at the door of the
hut someone was outside he raised
himself to the edge of the cot the
timber that served as a huge bolt was
being slid back the barrier creaked as
it was pulled outward wyman made
out a shadowy figure that slipped noise-
lessly into the room
  bare feet padded across the floor in
the darkness wyman felt a bare arm en-
circle his neck hot breath fanned his
face moist lis brushed his ear its
tatina a voice breathed
  wyman shook his head to clear it
he yawned breathed deeply i couldnt
keep awake he said
  that drink you had put you to
sleep tatina replied
  wymans muscles tensed drugged
eh he snapped why did you come
here
  to warn you i overheard atabapo
our chief who captured you he has
talked to our men they are going to
kill you 
  for what
  because you bring the oil company
atabapo told them you would take the
lake of death asphalt oil our golden
queen calls it the lake is sacred to our
people they are buried diere it saves
their souls
  does your golden queen know they
plan to kill me
  no the native girl answered
  thanks tor warning me tatina but
im afraid its too late i can hardly
move
  the girl sat down on the cot she
crushed herself close to wyman he felt
her hair caress his face her warm cheek
against his own her burning lips on his
ear am i not desirable american
her voice was deep husky

latore pointed to the metal floor grate look

terry fargo was drunk glori-
ously drunk he hooked his el-
bows over the bar at peg leg
hartwicks malakka cafe and bawled
at the top of his lungs
  whishkey dammit whishkey
  peg leg himself hobbled from the
rear of the stinking smoke-heavy water-
front gin-mill little green pig-eyes glit-
tered in his fat sweating face
  what ship sailor he demanded
  terry belched dramatically his head
rolled like a puppets no ship he
shouted whishkey 
  peg leg knew an american when he
heard one he glanced at the native
malay bartender there was a question
in his eyes the brown man understood
he nodded
  peg leg curled stubby fingers about
terry fargos hard-muscled arm he
banged the steel-sheathed peg of his
wooden leg twice against the brass rail
two bull-necked giants came out of the
smoky haze they crowded close on -
either side of terry
  whishkey terry bawled beating
a fist on the wet sloppy bar
  peg leg nodded the two giants
dropped ham-like hands on terrys
shoulders jerked him away from the bar
  nobody least of all the bull-necked
giants expected what happened next
terry twisted loose spun on his heel

and shot four steel-hard knuckles into
a hair-matted face he one-twoed driv-
ing his left fist to the point of the giants
jaw
  the first bruiser was just in the act
of folding when terry ducked twisted
like a top and put every ounce of his one
hundred seventy-five pounds behind a
bone-crushing uppercut the blow lifted
the second giant of his feet shot his
head back on his shoulders and dropped
him cold as a potato
  terry sucked his bruised knuckles
spat out the open door and hooked his
elbows on the bar
  whishkey he yelled
  peg leg stared at the two inert moun-
tains of flesh sprawled at the americans
feet beads of sweat popped out on his
forehead and trickled into the fatty folds
of his cheeks
  whiskey he echoed make it two
tongo jamesons
rthree drinks later when the two
fallen giants had crawled away to
nurse their swollen jaws peg leg broke
the conversational ice
  how about a woman mister
  terry looked into his empty whiskey
glass the pupils of his gray eves were
contracted to bright pin points
  white peg leg added young
too
terry was tough enough
for the waterfront-he
was the kind of man peg-
leg needed and it was
a queer enough job they
gave terry-helping a
chinese white-slaver 
dust
  terry looked at him through slitted
eyes he snickered and wiped his mouth
with the back of his hand
  peg legs voice dropped no foolin
mister real white ones chickens young
as hell jus come down
  where terry blubbered swaying
uncertainly
sshh not so loud ill steer yuh
right i could use a man like yuh ill

terry grinned foolishly whush at 
i need a man like yuh mister big
money job is it a go
  terrv shook his head avvrigh
whersh th woman 
  stay here peg leg hobbled to the
rear of the cafe terrys head swung
around and his glassy eyes followed him


spicy-adventure stories
in a moment the saloon-keeper was back
with a hat on his bald head one more
drink mister
  terry hiccuped no more cmon
outside the cafe peg leg hailed a
rickety carriage and helped terry in
the ancient vehicle rolled off the quay
and headed for the chinese coolie section
of malakka terry leaned back and
closed his eyes
  peg leg nudged him with his elbow
whats yuh name mister
  got none
  no monicker whats a man tuh call

  the ghost of a smile played about
terrys lips in the darkness peg leg
failed to see it dynamite he mum-
bled jush plain dynamite
  good as any peg leg laughed
yuh sure hit me bonny boys like yuh
wuz dynamite ever shipped

hphe carriage rolled to a stop before
a large cream adobe house it was
set back from the dirt street and half-
hidden behind scraggly sand-gray palms
  all out dynamite peg leg said
kin yuh keep yuh pins
  for answer terry lurched out of the
carriage he came very near falling
managing to reach the trunk of a palm
tree he pulled himself erect
  together they reached the door of the
adobe house
  peg leg hit the heavy walnut panel
a healthy smack with his fist footsteps
sounded inside and the door opened a
chinese in a black alpalca jacket nodded
to peg leg and stepped out of the door-
way
  blinking as he stumbled into a sump-
tuously furnished foyer terry leaned
against the gold-leaf wall he heard
the cafe-keeper addressing the chinese
tell th master im here
  the oriental shuffled away peg leg
bit off a chew from a sodden slab of
tobacco not a bad layout eh
terry heaved a momentous sigh seen
better he mumbled
  where

  the chinese servant came forward
soundlessly master say come-alone
peg leg shifted his chew from one
cheek to the other be back in a minute
dynamite he hobbled off after the
yellow man
tn a high-ceiled walnut-paneled room
entrance to which was gained by a
steel door that rolled soundlessly back
on oiled runners peg leg hart wick
cafe-keeper faced the man who was over-
lord of everything illicit in the malay
states
  latore was a product of the melting
pot of singapore his half-caste hindu-
stan mother had given herself willingly
enough to a deserter from the french
foreign legion she never knew
whether latore came as a result of this
experience or whether the blood of a
rich chinese trader ran through the
babys veins in either event he was left
at two months on the docks while the
woman who had borne him accepted the
invitation of a manchurian goat farmer
to accompany him into the mountains
  the early years had been hard for
latore when he was ten the malay
fisher family who had cared for him
since he was a babe all died of scurvy
suddenly he found himself dependent
poppy dust

on his own resources he learned quickly
to steal from the fruit boats and to rob
the pockets of drunken tourists at
eighteen he was trafficking in native
women supplying lithe brown-breasted
girls for the sailors of all countries whose
ships dropped anchor in the straits
  now at forty imperialistically do-
mineering behind a heavy mahogany desk
in a room with a steel door latore was
king of vice
  he looked up as peg leg doffed his
hat and hobbled forward there was a
slight asiatic slant to his eyes-prob-
ably the influence of the rich chinese
trader-and a teutonic hardness of his
mouth that seemed to indicate something
else in his heredity his hair was ebony
black it glistened under the light of
a glass-faceted chandelier his skin was
the color of rubbed nutmeg combining
the varied pigmentation of all the men
who had paid their respects to his mother
and her mother and all the mothers that
had gone before
  at times a strange softness came into
latores face it was mostly when his
eyes licked at the loveliness of a beauti-
ful girl he worshiped beauty in any
form yearly he would journey to the
art marts of paris and vienna and bring
back with him paintings and sculpture
for the private gallery he maintained in
singapore
tjxdr a long moment he glared at peg
leg hartwick disdain for the crip-
pled cockney saloon-keeper was evident
in the curl of his lips
  yes he questioned
  i got th man fer yuh guvnor peg
leg exclaimed enthusiastically brains
an brawn hes got like yuh said
  latore snarled another drunken
sailor i watched you lead the helpless
sot to the door if thats your idea of
the man i need you had better stop
looking and attend to your business
that last parcel i gave you-only a
pound---hasnt gone off yet nine ships
have sailed in the last week and you
could not find a single one on which to
send it do you imagine my clients can
wait a year
  peg leg gulped and colored he knew
the uselessness of making a retort la-
tore demanded the final word he backed
toward the steel door
  one moment latore barked this
man-what nationality is he
  american guvnor a bully boy too
guvnor had a hard time standin on
is pins guvnor an yet he-
  what is his name 
  dynamite he sez guvnor an im
ere to testify-
  what did you tell him 
  i give im th ole baited ook guvnor
th young white girl he swallowed it
solid peg leg grimaced pleased with
himself ysee i knowed about th new
one yuh got ere an-
  latore pushed a button under the top
of his desk the steel door slid open
a moment later the chinese servant
stepped into the room
  the man who is waiting ching
take him to the room where the girl is
lock them both in that is all
  latore rose as the oriental bowed and
departed he motioned to peg leg
  we shall see he said whether
your american is a gentleman or the
man i am looking for come with me
terry was in the same position
a leaning against the gold-leafed wall
when ching took his arm and guided
him up the heavily carpeted steps he
held back recalcitrantly
  where to  he shouted
  chings voice flowed like new honey

spicy-adventure stories
  latore rose my daughter zela mr
dynamite he said
  terry gulped pleased to meet you
zela extended her hand the wide
sleeve of the negligee fell away from her
arm
  i am delighted she murmured rest-
ing the cool petals of her fingers in
terrys moist palm
  this is the young man i have chosen
to accompany you when you venture
out zela latore said
  zelas hot eyes scanned terrys shoul-
ders and tapered hips
  i am certain he will be satisfactory
she said if you will excuse me- she
stepped through the opening in the wall
the panel closed
  latores voice brought terry out of
his trance the compensation will be
five pounds a week if that is satisfac-
tory later perhaps i will intrust you
with other duties naturally the remun-
eration will then be greater you will oc-
cupy the room you had last night my
servant will be at your command
okay terry said what about that
blonde i saw last night where is she
that latore replied will come
later for the present you had best for-
get her existence you understand
terry shrugged all right by me
latore offered a five pound note you
will be free to come and go as you please
unless my daughter desires your services
that is all
  terry was scarcely out of the studio
when a withered hunch-backed orien-
tal slid up to the desk latore addressed
him rapidly in a malayan dialect the
hunch-back grunted a reply and was
gone
a week later zela and latore were
together in the study the eurasian
woman smoked a cigarette through a
long ivory holder
  i should say he is perfect for your
purposes she said
  latores lips curled and for yours
what do you mean her shoulders
squared and her breasts lifted under a
loose-bodiced blouse
  i have no objections latore said
however do not lead yourself into be-
lieving that the american is infatuated
with you time and again he has in-
quired for his country-woman i assure
you if i should allow him to see her-
zelas breath hissed through her lips
contempt was mirrored in her seductive
eyes she pressed her blood-tipped fin-
gers to the hill of a breast
  you think so she murmured
latore shrugged what difference 
i think you are right about him i have
had him followed each time he went out
alone i am convinced he will have no
objections if you will adjourn to your
room i will see him he pushed a but-
ton zela departed through the open
panel into her boudoir
t atore motioned terry to a ctiair
when he came into the study it is
time to take you into my confidence he
said however i should first like to
warn you that betrayal means death you
understand 
  and how
  very well you have probably won-
dered as to my means of livelihood
briefly i am a dealer in opium how-
ever since the mongolian growers of
poppies have little or no use for money
i have been forced to develop another
medium of exchange therefore since
their greastest desire is for women whose
skin is white i have been trading eng-
lish and american girls for their wares
he paused while his eyes studied the
expression on terrys face it was non-
committal the girl you met the first
poppy dust

night is to be delivered to a bandit chief tore im no prude but when it comes to
on the morrow in return for ten pounds sending decent women-
of opium naturally securing these girls you measure decency in a strange
is by no means easy for the most part
they are women who come to the east
in entertaining troupes it will be your
duty to meet them at the american
hotel or in the cafes and lure them here
after that i will do the rest
  terry shook his head not me la-
manner my friend latore interrupted
these women are chips on the sea of
life i am giving them at least a per-
manent home they are the lowest of
the low
  not that blonde dame she was
class

spicyadventure stories
beautiful white girl sir velly beauti-
fol
  terry grunted wheres my buddy
wheres the guy witli the wooden stump
huh 
  come later ching murmured
  on the second landing ching led the
way to a door he unlocked it and urged
terrv into a large room the door
slammed and the key grated
  terry swayed on wide-set legs he
blinked and rubbed his hand over his
eyes for a split second he seemed to
snap out of his stupefied state as he
stared at the wide-eyed terror-stricken
girl cringing on a couch in the corner
  you might expect to find a girl like
that dining at the ritz or lolling on the
beach at newport but certainly not in
a filthy hell-hole like malakka
  she was beautiful-and young long
golden hair fell in high-lighted waves
far below her hunched shoulders her
cheeks were white with fear and her lips
were scarlet splashes in the alabaster
mask dark blue eyes-terror bright-
met his terry could sec where once
they might have been limpid swimming
pools now they were like hard sap-
phires
  she was dressed in a cheap cotton
frock the hem was ragged and there
was a rip down the side her arms
were crossed over her breasts but even
that protection failed to shield completely
the nubile firmness of the twin flesh-
round globes she wore neither shoes
nor stockings her legs were slim and
gently curved where the calves swelled
  terry glanced about the room there
were no windows a grate in the ceil-
ing indicated a ventilation system he
lurched forward hungrily arms out-
stretched
the girl screamed and darted off the
couch backing into an opposite corner
her arms were down at her sides now
and terry could see the sweet curves of
her body even under her formless dress
he licked his lips as her soft deep-set
breasts rose and fell his eyes dropped
to the sweep of her hips and the out-
line of her thighs beneath thin cotton
  be sociable baby he blurted
  the girl trembled like a leaf her
face was devoid of color like a sheet
of snow-white paper
  terry groped in his pockets and
brought out a package of native brown
paper cigarettes he lit one quickly and
blew a gray funnel of smoke ceiling-
ward he heard a faint shuffle above
him the pupils of his gray eyes
flickered
  cigarette baby he questioned
  the girls quivering lips gave forth
no sound like a trapped animal she
followed his every movement waiting
for the attack she seemed to know was
coming
  terry took one more drag at the
cigarette then dropped it to the floor
he made four stabs with his foot before
he ground the butt under his heel al-
most going off balance his bleary eyes
burned at the cowering girl
  cmere he growled
hphe girl was a graven image tense
  even her breasts had no movement
as she held her breath her neck
muscles stood out like whipcords
  terry moved toward her swaying
drunkenly she waited until he was
within arms reach to duck past him to
the momentary safety of the other side
of the room terrys hand shot out
steel fingers clamped her wrist a pierc-
ing scream made the tight-ceiled room
alive with high-pitched horror as terry
jerked her body into his arms
  like a wildcat she writhed and strug-
poppy dust

gled her dress dropped off one shoul-
der baring the creamy loveliness of the
upper slope of a breast before terrys
fingers could tear it farther the girl
raked five sharp nails across his face
  bellowing like a stuck pig terry re-
leased her but only for a moment his
face contorted with unspeakable rage
he lunged at her smashing the flat of his
hand against the side of her head
  the blow knocked her across the room
and down on the couch terry leaped
after her his arm shot out one
wrench ripped her cotton dress from her
body she wore only a tattered slip be-
neath it terrys eyes ran up the mother-
of-pearl smoothness of exposed flesh
the plane of her stomach melted into
luxuriously rounded hips one cheek
where terrys palm had struck was
pink with mounting color her breath
came in great gasps
  terry swayed backward he waved
the girls torn dress above him yelling
triumphantly then suddenly as though
the liquor he had imbibed had finally

spicy-adventure stories
become too much for him his knees
buckled and he crumpled to the floor out
cold
  for a long moment the girl stared at
his inert body unable to fully realize
that she had temporarily escaped tears
filled her eyes her shoulders twitched
she buried her face in a cusluon sobbing
hysterically
tn his walnut-panaled retreat latore
  counted bank-notes into peg leg
hart wicks outstretched hand
  ten pounds
  peg legs eyes were live coals thas
right guvnor hes th man aint he
no gentleman that bully boy guvnor
see ini strike er down
  latore wiped his hands one against
the other as though to clean them of the
taint of the bank-notes you will see
that the package i gave you gets aboard
a ship that is all
  peg leg thumped to the door sure
thing guvnor an thanks ter yuh
  latore pushed a desk button the
steel door slid back ching was waiting
  show- him out ching then remove
the drunkard from the girls room put
him to bed when he awakens let me
know
  ching nodded latore pressed a sec-
ond button the steel door closed sound-
lessly he walked across the room the
tips of his heavily ringed fingers touched
a spot on the wall one of the panels
slid up latore stepped through and
into a gorgeously furnished boudoir
resting on a silk brocade chaise longue
was a voluptuous raven-haired woman
  she smiled a greeting her blood-red
lips parting to reveal two rows of even
white teeth a marabou-trimmed negli-
gee was loosely draped about her un-
dulating figure the saffron-hued full-
ness of her conical breasts was visible
through the diaphanous chiffon
  latore approached the couch accepted
her outstretched hand and kissed the
long tapering fingers her eyes natur-
ally almond-shaped slitted until the long
curling lashes almost came together
  i have been waiting she murmured
sliding her sinuous hips to make room
for latore on the longue
  he sat beside her one hand dropped
to a knee silk covered the other moved
sensuously up the roundness of an arm
until it reached her bare flesh-warm
shoulder her lips parted and her eye-
lids fluttered she sighed softly
  i have found the man i need zela
an american
  she curled an arm about latores
neck must it always be business her
breasts swelled majestically under their
cob-web sheath she drew his head
down kiss ine
  latore held back it is important
zela
  a frown crossed her beautiful face
her arm dropped to her side it is
possible that the white girl is important
too she snapped
  latores eyes flashed the muscles of
liis jaws twitched he was about to utter
harsh words but instead he drew a deep
breath
  at times i am amazed at your lack
of mentality my beautiful one he said
idly his fingers moved over her shoul-
der tracing patterns hot lights flamed
in zelas pupils her body writhed under
the exquisite flesh torture
  kiss me she gasped
t atore lowered his mouth to her
moist lips her lips parted he could
barely restrain himself from clasping her
burning body in his arms but he did
sitting erect breathing heavily
poppy dust

  first you will listen to me he said
softly this american will take your
place providing i am assured of his
trustworthiness that will be for you to
discover you will treat him kindly as
only you know how you will even make
love to him if necessary learn every-
thing you can of course i will have
him followed wherever he goes at
present he is asleep when he awakens
i will have him brought to my study
you will enter at a propitious moment
is that clear
  zelas slim fingers caressed latores
cheeks yes she whispered tell me
now my lover who is the most beauti-
ful woman on this earth her hips
arched gently
  latore pressed her warm body to his
own his hands laved the warmth of her
shoulders her smooth back his lips
forged themselves to the well-spring of
her mouth
nerry fargo sat up in bed he
started to swallow but changed his
mind his mouth felt like a piece of
pickled tripe he had a hell of a head-
ache he rubbed his hand over his face
and grimaced what he needed now he
thought was a good stiff drink
whiskey he yelled
  the door of the room opened ching
stepped inside you called sir
terry blinked yes get me a drink
whiskey
  chings expression was blank you
wish perhaps the bath first sir
bath hell no get me whiskey
ching nodded and departed terry
pushed the covers down he seemed
faintly surprised to see himself dressed
in rich silk pajamas he remembered
vividly what had gone before even to the
blonde girl on the couch he could never
forget her
  ching returned with a glass of whis-
key terry gulped it down swung out
of bed a new suit of clothes and fresh
linen were spread out on a table
  there will be something else sir
ching questioned
  terry scratched his head maybe
that bath where is it
a half-hour later freshly shaved
and clothed terry watched the steel
door to latores study open he walked
in swinging his shoulders jauntily his
gray eyes riveted on the face of the man
behind the desk
  greetings he said
  latore smiled good morning do
you feel better
  much who do i thank for these
duds
  it is unnecessary to thank anyone

 el a in the boudoir regarded the
moment as propitious the wall panel
slid up and she came into the study now
her tall sirens body was clothed in a red
satin negligee her left hand held it
closed under her swollen breasts terry
gaped at her as she came forward

spicy-adventure stories
  a stray fish that happened to fall into
my net most of them however are
hardened his lips twisted and even
the one of whom you speak if you saw
her now you might change your mind
what do you mean 
  latore drummed his finger-tips on the
desk merely that she had become re-
signed to whatever fate i have in store
for her come i will show you
  they mounted the steps to the third
floor of the house latore opened the
door of a room he pointed to a metal
grate in the floor
  look r
town on his knees terry peered
into the room below the blonde girl
was reclining on the couch a silk ki-
mono she was wearing was half open at
the front baring glimpses of her high
luscious breasts and the modeled sweep
of her hips a wrinkled yellow oriental
ran his spider hands down her sides
while his thick lips kissed her mouth
she moaned and writhed her arms
circled the yellow mans neck drawing
him to her
  terry stood erect i dont get it
he said how come the quick change
latore smiled wdsely a simple
oriental preparation my friend you
see how utterly depraved the girl is
when her mongolian master comes for
her she will go willingly
  this job terry said whats it
worth 
  one hundred pounds for each girl

can find
  terrys knuckles were white through
the skin of his hand all right he mut-
tered when do i start
  latore shrugged as soon as you de-
sire the vice kings eyes narrowed
but remember mv friend that secrecy
is the essence i have ways of knowing
whether or not you are working for
latore or not
  terry passed his forefinger across his
throat he grinned something like
that 
  something my friend
  as he passed alone through the lower
hall terry heard a soft voice calling
he turned to see zela motioning from a
doorway that was another entrance to
her boudoir
  latore has told you everything  she
questioned once terry was in the room
and the door was closed her hands slid
up to his shoulders fingering meaning-
fully
  yes
  her voice dropped you must be
careful you are being constantly
watched latore is not the man with
whom to trifle she moistened her car-
mine lips i tell you this because-be-
cause- her body swayed forward
terry felt her breasts mashing against
his chest he inhaled the pungent per-
fume of her lips as she pressed their
parted moistness to his mouth
  hot thrilling sensations swept over
terry the eurasians mouth was a
blow-torch for heat
  she drew away panting now you
know she whispered some other time
when there is no danger yes her eyes
were star-bright
  terry nodded he backed to the door
still trembling from the avidness of her
caress
comehow he found his way to the
quay and peg leg hartwicks cafe
at the bar he had two whiskies it was
just enough to warm him for the work
he had to do he was finishing the
second drink when peg leg hobbled tip
  hya dynamite
poppy dust

  okay terry replied thanks a lot
for that job
  the saloon keepers voice dropped
you in with latore
  yes
  good boy i knowed yuhd fit in
he motioned to the bartender two
whiskies tonga
  when he backed away from the bar
an hour later terry was reeling he
stumbled out into the street glassy-eyed
a native woman carrying a basket
bumped against him terry yelled bloody
murder as he struck the woman across
the face she fell and rolled into the
road
  a white-turbaned policeman on the
docks saw the drunken assault he came
on the run swinging his club terry
ducked it and plowed his fist into the
policemans belly that done he spun
like a top and went out cold
fthe first officers shrill whistle
brought two more white-turbaned
minions of the law despite peg legs
protestations terry was bundled into a
wagon and driven off to the local station
house
  a night in jail sobered him up he
was released in the morning and went
immediately to the american hotel late
in the afternoon a carriage drove up to
the door of latores adobe residence
terry helped a stunning auburn-tressed
girl out of the conveyance
  ching admitted them master like to
see you-alone he said
  terry turned to the girl ill just be
a moment margot
  latore was standing behind his desk
when terry entered his study his face
was dark
  one more episode of that nature my
friend and we will sever connections
  terry grimaced i just took a few
drinks too many but i got a girl for
you
  i have seen her enter
  want me to bring her in  i told
her-
  she has already been taken to a
room latore said quietly
  terrys head jerked what do you
mean 
  just what i said my friend no
time is wasted i wish to prepare her for
the visit of my mongolian customer
possibly he would prefer her to the fair-
haired girl i will give him a choice
he opened the top drawer of his desk
and secondly it is not my desire to
have any evidence in view when the
british authorities arrive
  his hand snapped out of the drawer
holding a blunt-nosed automatic
  did you imagine for one moment my
friend that i might be fooled by so
shoddy a ruse latores voice was ex-
asperatingly smooth you knew you
were being followed and realized how
impossible it would be to reach the
authorities and so cleverly in your
bungling fashion you managed to have
yourself arrested no doubt you have al-
ready informed the colonial police as to
my activities you shall not live to bear
witness against me
  terry blanched there was nothing
to do now but brazen it out either that
or-
  his next move indicated the decision
he shoved the desk toward latore duck-
ing behind it the massive piece of
furniture slid across the polished fioor
the gun in latores hand belched fire
a moment before he was hit at the hips
a singing bullet whizzed over terrys
head and flattened against the steel door
  terry shot up and vaulted over the
desk luckily latores weapon had spun

tor long hours don stared into the
darkness the echo of andrews
chugging boat floated back up the river
moreland groaned aloud he knew the
demented mans words were true there
was no chance for rescue andrews lay
outside the two women would soon
share a like fate as soon as griggs the
madman tired of them then griggs
would lie in wait for the plane and swear
he was the only survivor andrews
store of uncut jewels would make him
wealthy for life moreland groaned
again
  dawn came he could no longer hear
the boat he knew thirst knew the
gnawing pains of hunger but worst of
all bleak fear gripped his heart over
and over he pictured his woman in the
desecrating hands of the demented
griggs he rolled and twisted closed
his eves but could not blot out the vision
he even prayed for death to take the
horrible mental scene from him he
couldnt stand it
  as midday lighted the shack more and
more his eyes grew able to pierce the
gloom he started some six feet away
from his bound ankles was the fourth
plunger the key to the dynamite be-
neath the house itself andrews last
resort he inched toward it a little at
a time painfully his bound body
cramped and deadened death thats
what he needed death thats what
he wanted irene was worse than dead
andrews was dead painful inch by
painful inch he made his way toward the
dynamite plunger
  now he was over it he worked his
feet up the wall ready to drop them on
the plunger that would send the hut and
its contents roaring aloft in the stillness
of the swamp death
  then he heard it a scratching whim-
pering cry presently dripping water
slime-covered tuona crawled through
the doorway and collapsed on the floor
her body gleamed red from many
wounds showed great welts and bruises
where the slime had washed away pres-
ently she revived and a few moments
later don moreland was free
  griggs had finished with tuona and
had cast her overboard believing her
to be dead tuona had obtained a pygmy
canoe and returned for the body of her
master and mate griggs had shot her
once through the shoulder in her crude
way she refused to say anything con-
cerning the fate of irene other than that
she was alive
  dully she hunkered down a hand cov-
ering a bleeding gash on her breast while
don gouged out a shallow grave for
andrews he wouldnt have stopped
that long except that she refused to
guide him until he did
tresently they were in the water
in the small dugout moreland pad-
dling like mad as she gestured straight
ahead beneath the swamp plants around
mangrove roots where lurked slimy
swamp creatures on and on they went
until dons muscles were one exquisite
pain blood throbbed and pounded at
his temples suddenly the green swamp
mist began to grow thinner the stench
less pronounced don sniffed hungrily

war club at his feet glanced forward at
the stony-faced tuona in her right
hand she bore a six foot slender rod of
bamboo
  they were still unobserved as they
made the schooner noiselessly don went
aboard a step forward another the

out the white form of the woman he
loved lashed to the bunk
  don don she moaned her eyes
were piteous
  a low growl rumbled in dons throat
his hands gripped the war club he
stepped forward griggs raised the re-
volver and shot him in the hip
 as don hit the deck the war
club clattered towards griggs griggs
laughed kicked it overboard
  you damned fool he giggled
ill-
  a surprised expression overspread his
face he gazed down at the center of
his chest something had thudded against
bone imbedded there in the flesh was
a dart a tiny blowgun dart
  don began to laugh hysterically then
the pain of his wounded hip got him
everything went black
tte awakened to find irene cra-
dling his throbbing head wrapping
soft cloth about his bleeding hip past
her he could see tuona sitting in the
stern staring back in the direction of the
mud island where her lord and master
was buried there was no expression
on her face across her naked knees
she still held the blowgun
  griggs wheres griggs
  irene shuddered gestured over her
shoulder the dart was poisoned she
said
  griggs lay hideously where he had
fallen his head and limbs were puffed
and swollen rapidly blackening the
face was contorted in a grimace of utter
agony and from the bony chest blood
was oozing in a thousand places like tiny
red drops of perspiration
  don shuddered turned back to the
lips that awaited him overhead a great
white plane droned and prepared to

gers blindly he twisted his body to one
side the deadly blade whizzed over his
chest
  terry pumped two shots at the open-
ing in the wall the first one went wild
but the second bullet caught ching be-
tween the eyes his arms jerked up and
he dropped lifeless blood pouring from
the black hole in his forehead
  turning to see whether latore showed
any signs of recovery terrys eyes
bulged the knife ching had thrown
was buried hilt deep in latores throat
the mans head rested in a pool of his
own crimson gore he was dead from a
severed jugular
  gun in hand terry dashed up the
steps he had no way of telling where
margot and the blonde girl were held
imprisoned only when he heard a shrill
hysterical scream was he led to the door
of a room he threw it open margot
was backed against a wall while the same
shriveled chinese whom terry had seen
before with the blonde lashed a black
braided whip across her
  terry clubbed his gun leaped for-
ward and brought the butt down on the
yellow mans head there was a hollow
thud the oriental dropped like an
empty sack
tte apprehended the wooden-legged
saloon-keeper major gran-
ville head of the colonial police in-
formed terry he made a complete
confession and we certainly owe a debt
ot gratitude to you and the american
secret service for cleaning up this foul
mess for us
  terry bowed in the direction of mar-
got kingsley miss kingsleys willing-
ness to co-operate was a great help
the english girl smiled i have battle
scars to show for it i never knew whips
could hurt that much
  terry turned to the little blonde girl
she had recovered from latores ad-
ministration of drugs
  and next time miss lord you wont
decide to take a trip around the world
unaccompanied and let yourself be in-
fluenced by exotic foreign strangers
ann lord heaved a deep sigh next
time mr fargo you might accompany
me
  terry had a vivid recollection of her
almost nude loveliness i might at that
he replied
  major granville drew terry aside
one of my men found that woman you
mentioned she was in the basement
her throat had been cut
  terry nodded i expected as much
it was she who told me i was being fol-
lowed im sorry he thought of the
one time her lips had burned against his
its dark in the shadow of the poppy

wasnt tied up he told her
  wantonly the girl dropped across his
lap her warm flesh sent thrills through
his frame for a moment she lay still
breathed audibly through her mouth
she sat up perched herself boldly oi
his lap her arms wound around his
neck she whispered if i untie you
american-will you love me
  bush wymans pulse leaped try- me
and see he answered
tiatina slipped off his knees crept
over the cot to his irack she tugged
at the cords that bound his wrists bit
them with her teeth the strands ioos-

native girl slid to the floor picked at his
ankle bonds until the knots were untied
wyman stood up took a few steps
around the room he returned to the
cot sat down close to the girl
  she moved closer to him he put an
arm around her bare shoulders drew
her tightly his other hand strayed over
her throat down her shoulders to her
waist she gasped tatina pressed her
hands over his crushed his fingers her
body tensed
  she threw herself backward dug her
nails into the back of his neck pulled
him down her hot breath was like
desert air on his face he lowered his
head to her wet lips tatina sighed in
the depths of her throat held him vise-
like her mouth bruised against his

back in the shack from which he had just

the golden-haired girl marjorie pack-

upper rooms and as he looked up his
blood went icy a scream had knifed
the night air
  wyman vaulted the low fence to the
garden he went cautiously up the out-

that was screened with a fiber hanging
he peered inside his flesh crept
  marjorie packard was clamped tightly
in the arms of the muscular chief ata-

his chest she bent backward tried in
vain to escape she twisted her half-
clothed body tore from his grasp backed
against the wall dont touch me ata-

  atabapo advanced toward the cring-
ing marjorie there is still time to save
him he smiled wryly
  then do it-hurry the yellow-
haired girl spoke breathlessly
  the indian chiefs eyes glistened
atabapo promise if- he hesitated
stared avidly at the girls milky body
  if what atabapo
  if the golden queen be my wife-like
i read in your books
tvtarjories body went rigid she
looked blankly at the chief who de-
manded his reward-like the men ot
civilization her figure was as motion-
less as a statue her lips parted slowly
all right atabapo i promise but
first you must free wyman see him
safely back with his people
  atabapo shook his head i want you
first now he went to her put his
sinewy arm around her slender waist
his right hand drew her irresistibly
marjories finger nails dug into her
palms she didnt move her face was
colorless resigned atabapos head low-
ered toward hers
  and at that moment bush wyman
hurtled his body through the doorway
his iron fingers tore into the natives
naked shoulders pulled him backward
with mighty force atabapo crashed to
the floor murderous rage flaming from
his obsidian eyes as he recognized his at-
tacker
  the native chief got to his feet with
the swiftness of a plunging hare his
hand went to his loin cloth a knife
flashed marjorie screamed wyman
hunched his broad shoulders the in-
dian leaped like a tiger swung his blade
in a vicious trajectory wyman side-
stepped thrust out his foot atabapo
tripped sprawled on the floor
  wyman dived after him the indian
twisted got his shoulders squared and
raised his blade as wyman landed the
sharp edge ot the knife sliced along bush
wymans arm cut the cloth of his shirt
biood soaked the flannel wyman
ground his jaws together clamped down
with both hands pinioned the wrist of
the native
  atabapo rolled his powerful body car
ried wyman over with him bush wy-
man clung tenaciously to his adversary
wymans head cracked against the par-
tition as they struck the wall his grip
loosened on the indian atabapo jerked
free got to his knees struck down with
his dagger the steel went through
wymans sleeve jammed into the floor-
boards
  wyman ripped loose from the knife
ame to his feet his fist shot out with
a mighty swing it fetched up with
crushing power on the natives mouth
crimson drooled from the mans shat-
lered teeth he staggered backward
tripped went down lay inert
  sandaled feet pattered on the stairway
outside they raced along the veranda
came to the doorway of the room wy-
mans eyes riveted on a half dozen in-
dians who stopped at the threshold red
fury possessed wyman he crouched
doubled his huge fists as the forward
native drew a murderous-looking knife
 s bush wyman nerves edged waited
his chance a gap opened between
two of the indians at the door a figure
glided between them darted into the
room to wyman it was tatina the
native girl who had released him in the
cabin she poked a revolver in bush
wymans hand spoke breathlessly

loaded it for you

spartan merely flexed his wrist the bal-
ance was excellent no need to show
off strength was precious he was
tense his knees shook would the sig-
nal ever come it did
phe gaul intent on winning in a
rush charged forward with a pow-
erful sword-blow started behind his back
spartacus slid the blow off his shield
no need to take the shock of the blow
he countered with a fast waist-high
sweep the gaul barely blocked it in
time spartacus followed up with three
dazzling chops aimed first at the mans
head then at his waist then at his
thigh
  the gaul sparred cautiously sparti-
ctis had expended precious strength but
it was necessary to prove his prowess
the gaul had a taste of the skill that
had slain a hundred men he didnt like
it but he countered gamely as sparta-
cus was content to assume the defensive
this gave the spartan a chance to study
his opponents technique
  the gaul favored a fast overhand
stroke rich with power the intent was
obvious to smash the shield a solid
blow a few would paralyze the shield
arm spartacus knew that he de-
flected each cut diverted some to earth
others above his head the gaul had a
nice recovery
  the stands fell silent the empress
hugged her breast and kept biting her
lips even the emperor who knew
nothing of the jewels sat on the edge
of his seat the crowd seemed to sense
in spartacuss actions the drama and
tragedy of this combat only the metal-
lic clatter of sword on shield filled the
air
  then spartacus brought the crowd to
their feet with an amazing display of
mixed overhand and side blows that
made his shining sword seem everywhere

mans iegs the blow was adroitly
mocked good sword plav that
  but the gaul had retreated spartacus
pressed his advantage with a sudden
lunge the sword point struck the
gauls metal girdle and slithered up to
his naked chest it drew blood the
crowd roared but spartacus was not
deceived a mere prick he followed
through with a difficult reverse stroke at
the gauls sword side the gaul barely
managed to block with his sword hilt
even so the blow grazed his right side
more blood the crowd was in a frenzy
now
  then the gaul opened up with an at-
tack that sickened spartacus he still
favored the overhand stroke but sparta-
cus was no longer able to deflect them
the gaul had cunningly observed the
precise tilt of his opponents shield he
altered his straight stroke to a fast arc
that was catching the shield solidly
cpartacuss shield arm was
numbing slowly it lowered but
he was still blocking sparks flew from
metal he tried to defect a blow upward
above his head it was a mistake he
knew that his shield was too low the
instant the gauls sword struck
  the blow slithered from the shield
and ploughed into the softer metal of
spartacuss helmet fear seized him he
wavered blood was coursing down his
neck somehow he managed to block
the next blow but the one after that
caught him off balance he tripped and
fell to one knee just in time he jerked
the shield over his head the down-
rushing sword struck solidly sparta-
cuss spine bent like a twig he couldnt
get up panic seized him
  a groan came from the crowd spar-
tacus awaited the end
  but the gaul having tasted his op-
ponents skill was cautious he feared
a sham and backed a step away spar-
tacuss strength returned he could have
gotten up but he didnt a clever plan
shot through his bruin
  would the gaul use both hands in
wielding the sword for the final blow
that would lop ofl spartacuss head
  he did
  assured that the spartan was indeed
unable to get up the gaul dropped his
shield took the sword in both hands and
lowered it behind his back it was the
moment spartacus had prayed for
  with incredible speed the spartans
sword shot out in a wide semi-circle
some six inches above the ground the
gaul tried to jump away too late the
sharp steel chopped through his left
ankle slowed little then struck off his
right foot the gaul fell screaming
spartacus jumped to his feet the
bloody sword dropped behind his back
it flashed a great arc in the sunlight
  the gauls head was severed at the
neck so great was the impact tliat the
head rolled dismally away the severed
neck spurted twin streams of blood
pulsating blood diminishing in pressure
and volume
  spartacus ran to the dressing rooms
joseph was there he tugged off the
helmet and let the judean slap an already
prepared bandage on the wound then
he raced to the street julians guards
were too amazed to stop him
utside aristius was holding the
 gray arabs the spartan leaped
to the chariot they were off like the
wind with the roar of the crowd in their
ears like distant thunder the two men
exchanged a handshake more eloquent
than words

probed said aristius the empress
so promises
  spartacus said nothing soon they
clattered into the court yard of the villa
hoofs drew sparks from the stones as
they skidded to a stop as aristius held
the rearing arabs spartacus sprinted
to the villa
  he raced to the great room and
stopped short the andalusian had been
tied to the wall and in front of her
swayed the gloating julian only an
expanse of cloth at the groin covered
her in the hot light her thighs gave
off a rich brown lustre as the firm taut
skin held a mirror-like sheen her ripe
breasts were starkly protruding and the
upward and outward position of her
arms had drawn them out and upward
to form a deep valley between their lofty
heights glossy black hair spilled about
one boneless shoulder to glisten hotly
against the smooth golden flesh it was
a glorious sight-save for julian
  the romans eyes were avid eager
bestial he could barely control his
frenzy of passion
opartacus uttered an animal cry
 of rage and in five great strides had
caught the hapless julian by the nape
of the neck the roman paled and be-
gan to whimper like a whipped puppy
spartacus knocked him to the floor
where he lay slobbering with fear his
pigs eyes glazed and dilated
  thou diest yelled spartacus a
death deserving the deaths thou hast
wrought a hundred ravished maidens
wilt this day be avenged
  but how then the warmness of the
room caused spartacus to smile stoop-
ing he jerked the roman to his feet
twisted his arm and obtained a paralyz-
ing grip on the nape of his neck he
forced the roman forward-toward the
couches
  julian screamed and fought a brazier
of red hot coals was drawing closer
soon the smoke struck their bodies the
spartans arm shoved with a resistless
power mercifully julian fainted his
head went down down and on down
there came a horrifying hissing as his
nose ground into the embers on down
the hissing redoubled blue smoke
curled ceilingward
  the stench of burning flesh and hair
filled the room with a putrid stench on
down clouds of smoke now one
could not see the head then a gust of
wind swept away the smoke jets of
steam were spurting from the crisping
ears
  spartacus released him he fell face
up on the floor he was dead he had
no face just a charred black hole still
smouldering blood oozed met the fiery
flesh and turned to steam it was a
ghastly blood-chilling sight spartacus
turned him over
  then he released the andalusian she
fainted in his arms her body was pleas-
antly cool against his feverish flesh he
put her on a couch and kissed her lips
she revived
  we art free he told her
  to love
  aye to love
  she smiled
  the blood of andalusians flows like
hot beady wine does not that worry
thee
  he laughed
  by the gods is not half the blood
in my veins andalusian
  we shalt see she said dreamily we
shalt see
blood and fire

and her eyes became pools of desire
and the majesty of her breasts rose
in their full glory as she inhaled deeply
spartacuss mouth watered at the lus-
ciousness of her lips her loveliness
was a magnet drawing him closer and
closer
  when aristius came in he gave one
startled look and tip-toed from the place
in the heart of rome his own wife
would be rising from her bath her per-
fect body dripping rose-scented water
the vision was enchanting-and he re-
membered he must be the first to acquaint
her of the news of julians death
  how far was it would there be
time
  the whip cracked over the heads of
the gray arabs sparks flew beneath
flailing hoofs the chariot slewed
through the gates on one wheel manes
came back in the wind like battle flags
  aristius was to surpass his record at
the circus maximus

  the kao tsu dragon she snatched
at it but he witheld it
  you wait a minute he fumbled
with the pot-belly for a moment and
then a section of it swung open he
drew out a strip of parchment which
had been rolled in the interior one end
remained fastened in the belly the
parchment was covered with tiny chi-
nese characters
  then you knew  she was consider-
ably agitated
  i knew you wasnt any art collector
and i found out that the dragon ram
lai gave me for you was the genuine
kao tsu so i did some sleuthin and
found out plenty you wanted this for
your old man and he sent you after it
because youre smarter than anybody
workin for him
  that writin is an agreement signed
by the chinese war-lord they call gen-
eral kai givin your old man an option
on an important oil concession he gave
it to your old man a few years ago in
a moment of generosity and like a chi-
naman rigged the agreement up in the
belly of this dragon which is a clever
copy of the original kao tsu your
old man thought all the time it was the
kao tsu and thats what you come
after
oecause a few months ago your
old man decided to develop that
concession sos to recoup his stock mar-
ket losses but general kai had changed
his mind he wanted to give that con-
cession to another firm but if he re-
fused in the teeth of his own signed
agreement hed lose face so he had
it stolen from your old man meanin to
destroy the agreement and then claim he
never made it but shareef ahmed who
dont overlook many bets had it stolen
from kais agent he already had the
original kao tsu
  then ahmed offered it to the highest
bidder your old man had lost so much
money in the stock market crash he was
afraid general kai would outbid him so
he sent you to steal it general kai also
had his agents after it bull davies bein
one of em ram lai stole both dragons
he gave you the real kao tsu but he
kept the one with the contract in it and
was goin to sell it to general kais
agent you know the rest
  but the dragon- she exclaimed be-
wilderedly that one i mean
  easy he grinned jum chin had
it all the time he killed ram lai and
must have found the dragon on him be-
fore ahmed got there ahmed trusts
jum chin so it didnt occur to him to
suspect him an arabs no match for
a chinaman in wits i found it on jum
chin when i searched him he wont
dare tell ahmed weve got it because
thatd betray his own treachery i
sneaked back when they quit chasin me
and was waitin outside for a break
well i got it
  give the dragon to me she ex-
claimed its mine i paid you
you paid me for the genuine kao
tsu he said his eyes devouring a sleek
thigh the sarong left bare you got it
this comes extra
  how much she demanded sulkily
  money aint everything he sug-
gested
  suddenly she smiled meltinglv and
came up to him laying a slender hand
on his arm her nearness made him
dizzy and she did not resist as he passed
an arm about her waist

  trustingly he placed it in her hand-
and quick as a cat she plucked the pistol
from his belt and smashed him over the
head with the barrel the next instant
she was streaking for the door but she
underestimated the strength of his skull
to her dismay he did not fall he stag-
gered with a gasping curse then righted
himself and leaped after her he caught
her as she grasped the knob slapped the
pistol out of her hand and spun her back
into the room crushing her wrists in
one hand as she tried to claw his eyes
out
  you little cheat he snarled
youve never kept a bargain yet well
youre goin to keep this one youve
got what you want and im goin to get
what i want and you cant squawk
because you cant have the world know-
in about this nights work
  knowledge that this was true pepped
up her struggles but to her dismay she
found them useless against the strength
of her irate captor all her kicking and
squirming accomplished was to disar-
range the sarong and he caught his
breath at the sight of all the pink and
white curves displayed
  you dont dare she gasped as he
drew her roughly to him you dont
dare-
bill clanton didnt even bother to
reply to her ridiculous assertion    
tt was some time later when he
grinned at her philosophically he
stooped and kissed her pouting mouth
maybe thatll teach you not to associate
with people like me he said
  her reply was unprintable but the
look in her eyes contradicted her words
as she took his arm and together they
went out to the street
