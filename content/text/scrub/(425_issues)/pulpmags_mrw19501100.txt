a department for readers conducted by

foghorn clancy

americas most famous rodeo expert and handicapper

greetings waddies rope yourself a
cayuse from the corral and we will
be off on another trail jaunt and
have some more trail talk its swell to ride
over the trails of yesteryear

  trails that held danger and romance are
now paved highways and they do not follow
the old trails only touch them here and
there as in those old days the trails were not
laid out with the aid of a transit surveyers
chain and lining rod or by engineers as the
highways are today-but they were made by
men horses mules and oxen trying to
create the best passage from one place to
another

  romance still lives along the highways as
it did along the early trails romance will
never die and the highways that have taken
the place of the early day trails have not lost
all their danger true there are no more
hostile indians and hitch-hiking murderers
and hijackers have taken the place of the
old time bandits who held up and robbed the
stage coaches

crimes then and now

  in march of this year not very far from
where the apaches massacred a stage coach
load of travelers in what has been known as
the wickenburg massacre in arizona two
teen aged boys attempted to rob a movie
photographer with whom they had hitched
a ride shot him-inflicting a fatal wound
from which he died an hour later so while
the west has been tamed and is now just like
the other parts of the united states theres
still crime

all over the country there are still people

who will try to take any kind of wealth from
its rightful owners and if balked in the at-
tempt they seem to have no reluctance about
taking life

  while we live in the greatest country in all
the world we must exercise care and caution
as crime which was once rampant in the
west still exists in some measures most
everywhere

  the wickenburg massacre was one of the
many outrages that stamped the apaches as
one of the most cruel and brutal tribes of
all the indian races and was one of the
tragedies of the west that called the attention
of the government and the people of the
east to the fact that something drastic had to
be done in order to bring the apaches under
control

the loring massacre

  out on highway  about nine miles west
of wickenburg there is a stone monument
built by the arizona highway department in
 to mark the spot of the massacre which
is sometimes referred to as the loring mas-
sacre

  fred w loring most prominent of the
victims was from boston massachuesetts
his age was only  he had graduated from
harvard the year before in fact in 
the massacre occurred on november th


  loring had engaged in journalism and
had joined the wheeler expedition which he
accompanied through its rambles finally
reaching prescott arizona on his way home
it was his death at the hands of the apaches
that caused the howl to go up from new eng-
land that apaches should be treated with
less bible and more sword

  other victims were c s adams john
lanz fred w shoholm w g salmon and
p m hamel these were killed on the spot
while a miss mollie shepperd was wounded
the wound at the time did not seem to be
dangerous but she was reported to have died
from the effects of the wound about a year
later the sole surviver was a mr kruger

  hamel and salmon were both also mem-
bers of the wheeler expedition both resi-
dents of san francisco and on their way
home shoholm was also on a trip to his old
home in philadelphia after an absence of
several years spent in prescott where he
had been a member of the firm of jewell 
company c s adams had a wife and three
small children in san francisco and was on
his way home to join them he had been en-
gaged in the flour business in prescott

dutch john

  it seemed that everyone on the stage was
on his way home with the exception of
john lanz the driver better known as
dutch john who came from san bernardi-
no california just about four weeks before
his death he had obtained the position of
stage driver on the wickenburg-ehrenberg
stage route the fatal trip being his second
trip as driver of the stage and his first trip
from the wickenburg end of the route

  miss shepperd was said to be a member of
the demimonde but like many other ladies
of shady reputation in the early west she
commanded respect from the male popula-
tion if not from the female population by
reason of her beauty she was dressed in the
height of fashion had a kindly disposition
and pleasing personality she was adven-
turous but always played the role of good
samaritan she was generous in gifts to those
who were unfortunate and in need nursing
the sick with motherly care while many of
the women who had never been in a position
to be befriended by her might gossip about
her she held a warm place in the hearts of
all her male acquaintances

  on top of the monument of rock marking
the spot of the massacre there is a repre-
sentation of a stage coach with the four
horses the driver and thepassengers this
seems to be a flat mold of cast iron but upon
gazing upon it the first thing i noticed was

the absence of a shotgun messenger the man
who usually rode on the seat beside the
driver or on top of the stage armed and
almost always ready for an attack appar-
ently there was no shotgun messenger used
on that stretch of the stage route as the story
says nothing about such a member of the
party

details of the tragedy

  it is somewhat hard to tell from the con-
flicting stories just how the massacre oc-
curred as details of the many stories of the
tragedy differ the wickenburg correspond-
ent of the journal-miner wrote that all the
party was killed except mr kruger and
miss shepperd on this they all agree but
some of the stories are to the effect that miss
shepperd died two days after the massacre
while others are to the effect that she died
later in southern california this latter ver-
sion seems to be correct as the story by the
wickenburg correspondent was written five
days after the massacre and as the bodies
of the victims as well as the two survivers
were taken to wickenburg the correspondent
would have known if miss shepperd had died
and would have embodied it in his story

  according to the story by the wickenburg
correspondent the party left wickenburg in
fine spirits as they were homeward bound
and probably had no thought of any real
danger miss shepperd mr kruger and
three others sat inside the coach young
loring rode on top with the driver

  the first warning was the yell of the driver
apaches then the first volley ripped into
the stage coach as the savages bore down
upon it evidence was found that the am-
bushers had lain in wait for the stage for
some time lanz the driver shoholm and
davis were killed by the first volley or by
the second one which followed only a second
behind the first

one victim was scalped

  loring and hamel must have become
confused as they jumped from the stage on
the side from which the attack was being
made loring being unarmed could do noth-
ing except attenjpt to run but he never got
away from the spot for he was cut down by
the bullets of the assassins hamel must have
fought bravely for his life but in vain he
was the only one of the victims who was
scalped and it is said to be a custom of the
apaches to scalp those who fight bravely in
defense of their life

  miss shepperd said to be only slightly
wounded in that first volley and kruger
who was unwounded jumped from the stage
on the opposite side and began running west
toward the culling stage station kruger was
armed they were pursued on horseback
which made accurate shooting almost impos-
sible when their pursuers got too close
kruger would stop and fire upon them

  this stopped them for a few moments after
which they charged again but they were
finally discouraged and withdrew back to-
ward where the stage coach had been at-
tacked

  kruger and miss shepperd ran on until
they met an eastbound stage which picked
them up and returned to the station where
the alarm of the tragedy was sent by mes-
senger to wickenburg via a roundabout route
by way of the vulture mine as the messenger
was afraid to travel over the same route as
the attacked stage had traveled for fear that
the indians were still waiting for the east-
bound stage

trail of the attackers

  it was in the morning when the attack
occurred but it was midnight before the
news reached wickenburg and immediately
two parties were formed one to bring back
the bodies of the victims and the other to
take up the trail of the assassins this party
was headed by george munroe and when
they reached the scene a horrible sight met
their eyes the victims sprawled in pools of
blood hamel scalped and mutilated was
enough to make those hardened men of the
posse vow vengeance upon the perpetrators

  again the stories are at variance as in one
story it is claimed that the attacking force
was not mounted but on foot other stories
are to the effect they were not apaches at all
but a band or group of mexicans bent on
robbing the stage

  however by deduction one would no doubt
come to the conclusion that if the attack
were indeed made by indians on foot they
surely would have taken the horses but the
horses were not stolen and were still with
the stagecoach when the posse arrived at
the scene

it would also appear that if the attackers
continued on page

                     when the masked rider ar-
                     rives in splitrock hes given
                     a law star and told to
                     ride in search of-himself

                    chapter i

                      possemen wanted

          riding into splitrock wayne
          morgans senses-the keenly
          whetted instincts of a man long
          hunted by men-detected the pressure of
          suspense which gripped the cowtown
          built within winchester range of the
          mexican border

                some event of great magnitude in the
              affairs of this arizona range had drawn
              the crowd before the columned facade of

a wayne morgan novel by

v

walker a tompkins

                    
wayne morgan dons a badge on a border bandit

the courthouse emptying every chair and
bench along main street

  the focus of their attention was a door
marked sheriff where the twin-bored
snout of a shotgun was thrust throueh a
window propped open a few inches by a
beer-bottle wedge that weapon was
holding the sullen explosive tempers of
the mob in check

  so this is why no sheriff was waiting
for blue hawk and me when we crossed
the mountains last night morgan
thought and he felt an urge to ride on to
the courthouse plaza and find out why
this town had cornered its sheriff in his
own office

  but there was no time for that blue
hawk his faithful yaqui indian partner
was waiting for him out in the seco ma-
dura foothills gaunt from two days rid-
ing without food morgan was taking
desperate personal risks in visiting this
desert outpost to stock up on supplies
he must remain inconspicuous attend to
his errand and fade out of splitrock as
quickly as possible

  food and ammunition they must have
at whatever personal risk of capture and
splitrock was the only source of supplies
within a hundred-mile radius morgan
could not return to his indian companeros
camp with empty saddle-bags they could
not depend on bagging wild game in this
raw and desolate malpais country where
animal life had been reduced to an oc-
casional gila monster or rattlesnake

  the odors of chili and coffee and barbe-
cued -meat wafted out of a restaurant
window and reminded wayne morgan of
his own acute need for food he reined in
the hammerhead roan he rode and half-
hitched his reins to a chewed tie-rail dis-
mounted he was a towering six-footer
clad in the hickory shirt flat-crowned
stetson and bullhide chaps of a cow-
puncher

  ducking under the hitchrail bar he
paused to adjust the weight of the cedar-
stocked s holstered low on either

flank his spurs made a faint jingling
music to disturb the unnatural quiet of
splitrock as he crossed the plank side-
walk then he entered the arcade of the
building whose false front carried a
weathered sign

border mercantile  cafe

  a gaunt oldster whose purple sleeve
garters clashed with the faded yellow of
his shirt halted in his job of grinding cof-
fee in a big red-and-gold mill and turned
to size up the rugged young stranger who
approached him

  glad to see one man in town aint 
caught the lynchin-bee fever groused
the storekeeper accepting the penciled
list which morgan dropped on the pine
counter before him coffee beans bacon
sugar salt canned peaches snuds match-
es forty-five shells thirty-thirty shells
dried prunes you must be headin
into the hills on a prospectin expedition
voung feller to need all o this grub

mopping his face with his necker-
chief morgans glance slid off the
storekeepers face and focused on a re-
ward poster tacked to a nearby shelf
bold black letters read

        wanted-dead or alive

         reward payable
        for capture of outlaw
        called masked rider

  no man in the entire west with the ex-
ception of blue hawk wayne morgans
yaqui compadre knew that he was the
masked rider that robin hood rider of
the frontier who had pledged himself to
fight the lawless and aid the weak and
oppressed was this storekeeper fishing
for information morgan knew that his
looks indicated that he obviously was a
cowhand not a prospector as the store-
keeper had hinted

  whats this-about a lynching bee
morgan inquired

  the storemans eyes took on the bright
glitter of a cow-country gossip eager to
chase that leads to a roaring gun showdown

chat with a stranger you didnt know
the sheriff dabbed his loop on joaquin
musto he asked that mob you seen in
front of the courthouse is honin to drag
musto out and string him up only jeff
jennings wont allow it

  morgan emitted a low whistle of sur-
prise joaquin musto was a name well-
known to him musto was the leader of

fending joaquin musto against a hang-
rope-minded mob sheriff jeff jennings
would be unable to head a posse else-
where on a search for the masked rider

  musto the storekeeper was chatter-
ing on made the mistake of killin old
joshua hemingway over to the stirrup
ranch yesterday just as the sheriff was
ridin up to visit josh sheriff jennings is

wayne morgan

a band of border hoppers who had been
the scourge of arizona territory for near-
ly a decade it seemed incredible that this
elusive dangerous bandido could be be-
hind bars in splitrocks jail at this mo-
ment

  to morgan however the news came as
a personal relief having only yesterday
shaken off a posse in the seco maduras
morgan knew that splitrock countys
sheriff had undoubtedly been warned
that the masked rider was in this ter-
ritory presumably mexico-bound in de-

seventy-six and he couldnt shoot a hoss-
fly if it crawled up his gun-barl but he
was lucky enough yesterday to crease
mustos noggin at a hundred yard range
with his first shot

  wayne morgan cut in impatiently as
the garrulous storekeeper paused for
breath

  ill step into the cafe next door for a
bait of grub while youre sacking up my
order mister see you in half an hour
please have my order sacked and ready
by then


	masked rider western

  restaurants locked up cooks jined
that mob in front of jennings office thats
howlin for musto to be strung up instead
of wastin judge mcsherrys time givin
him a court trial the oldster tittered
funny thing the sheriff fortin up to de-
fend the life of the desperado hes spent
ten year tryin to get his hooks into but
jennings is a stickler for what he calls
justice and the due process of law even
where the prisoner is a man whos danged
nigh ruined this country with his rustlin
raids and bank robberies

  morgan headed for the street door
knowing the talkative storeman would
not start assembling his supplies as long
as he had a stranger to talk to as he was
stepping out on the mercantiles porch he
caught sight of a black-whiskered rider
hammering up the main street on a lather-
flecked roan gelding filling the narrow
canyon of false fronts with a thick smudge
of alkali dust as he swept past the store

  there goes lane scofield who runs
the slash s outfit next to hemingways
stirrup range exclaimed the store-
keeper shouldering past morgan sco-
field ridin in to join that mob will be
bad news to the sheriff scofields got a
lot of say-so around here-hes the last
of the big ranchers that aint been bank-
rupted by mustos raids if he calls for a
hangin bee-

wayne morgan watched the
slash s rancher rein up in front of
the courthouse at his lusty shout the
would-be lynch mob wheeled about and
what scofield had to say brought a prickle
of apprehension to morgans backbone

  sheriff he bawled i got big news
for yuh sheriff i spotted the masked
rider and his pards camp this momin-
on verde crick

  this was what morgan had dreaded
having successfully outwitted the posse
of a neighboring county during the night
now he and blue hawk had been seen
and recognized after crossing the summit
into splitrock basin today

  knowing he was secure behind the an-
onymity of his wayne morgan role this

man who was also the masked rider
found himself hurriedly following the
storekeeper toward the courthouse plaza
as he reached the adobe brick fence
where scofield had left his horse mor-
gan saw the door of the sheriffs office
open and a raw-boned oldster wearing a
silver star stepped out to face the throng

  sheriff jeff jennings carried a sawed-
off shotgun in the crook of his elbow in
the office door behind him stood another
oldster a white-haired man in a black
frock coat and a clean-cut young man in
his early twenties both were carrying
buckshot guns father and son this
pair morgan figured level-headed
enough to back up jennings to save
musto from lynch rope

  in the excitement of the sensational
news which scofield had brought to town
the mob appeared for the moment to have
forgotten musto and their original pur-
pose in gathering in front of the jail for
here was something bigger more dra-
matic and sensational lane scofield had
located the masked riders camp

  scofield had dismounted and elbowed
his way through the press of gun-hung
stetson-hatted cowpunchers and towns-
people in the throng at the foot of the
courthouse steps morgan saw the slash
s rancher a man who wore thonged-
down holsters and whose face had the
pinched predatory look of a zopilote buz-
zard climb those steps

  more than curiosity had drawn wayne
morgan here to listen to what scofield
had to say if scofield claimed to have
seen the masked rider and blue hawk
camping in verde creek canyon he was
either mistaken or he was lying for some
reason of his own verde creek canyon
was better than twenty miles north of
the mexican border he and blue hawk
had crossed the mountains by the way of
a high pass which had been bisected by
the rock cairns marking the international
boundary and the yaqui now was in the
seco madura foothills still blue hawk
might have made camp in that canyon

  sheriff jeff jennings words carried to
morgan above the excited rumbling of

	masked rider western

the throng

  the masked riders camped on verde
crick eh you dead certain of that
scofield

  the slash s boss nodded emphatically
seen em with my own eyes sheriff
like to killed my hoss gettin here to re-
port you got to surround that canyon
with a posse before sundown or the
masked rider and that injun pard of his
will be across the border into sonora be-
fore sunup tomorrow

  excitement was like a prairie fire
sweeping through the assembled mob
mention of the masked rider was enough
to make these men forget even the ex-
istence of joaquin musto the bandido who
had spread a reign of terror over this
range for more than a decade and who
now waited behind bars in jennings jail

  well what are we waitin for-christ-
mas snarled lane scofield round up
a posse and lets get ridin sheriff
jennings was plainly wrestling with a
dilemma

  reckon its my duty to see what i
can do about smokin the masked rider
out o cover he admitted but i hate to
leave judge mcsherry here and luke to
hold off these lynch-minded hombres i
aim to see joaquin musto hang but hang
legal

fane scofield swung around to
j face the tense silent mob there
was no doubting the authority this ranch-
er wielded

  scatter men shouted the slash s
boss you all know mustoll be sentenced
to hang soon as judge mcsherry can hold
his trial now we gotbigger game to go
after-the masked rider

  we aint leavin town lane some-
body shouted from the crowd too much
chance of mustos gang raidin the jail and
rescuin their ramrod if they try we got
to be here to-

  but the crowd was already breaking
up swayed by the personality of lane
scofield sheriff jennings lowered the
hammers of his buckshot gun

  im callin for volunteers to step up

an be deputized to ride after the masked
rider he shouted if my posse catches
him youll all share and share alike in
the reward for the masked rider

 wayne morgan saw a change come
over the bloodthirsty men who had been
demanding joaquin mustos life

  youre wastin your time sheriff a
man yelled you heard what was just
said-we got to stick around town in
case mustos gang shows up besides
tacklin the masked rider and his red-
skin pard would be the same as com-
mittin suicide in my book

  jennings face purpled with wrath at
this spectacle of mass cowardice out of
this crowd of a hundred or more men
who did not hesitate to form a lynch mob
not one had the nerve to join a posse to
hunt for and shoot down the notorious so-
called robin hood outlaw and his yaqui
companion

   sta bueno sheriff jennings said
grimly scofield and me will go after
that desperado ourselves but im warn-
in all you fellers-judge mcsherry and
his son luke are forted up inside my
office with scatter-guns try and lynch
mustr while im gone and the mcsherrys
will butcher you with buckshot on these
very steps

  wayne morgan waiting outside the
plaza wall came to a sudden decision he
suspected that for some unexplained
reason lane scofield had lied when he
claimed to have spotted the masked
riders camp his motive could be to
lure the sheriff away from the splitrock
jail to give this mob a better chance to
lynch joaquin musto

  but assuming that scofield had actually
spotted the camp where blue hawk was
waiting morgans return-the yaqui al-
ways left sign for morgan to follow-the
prudent thing to do would be to join the
sheriff on this manhunt he owed that
much to blue hawk in the event of a
showdown

  sheriff wayne morgan called out in
a loud voice im game to volunteer for
posse duty ill side you and scofield when
you tackle the masked rider
the outlaw sheriff



chapter ii

ambuscade

 he splitrock sheriff led his
 two-man posse out of town
 at a gallop as soon as lane
 scofield had switched his
 saddle from his spent mount
 to a fresh pony at a main
 street livery the business
 of deputizing the ruggedly
 handsome young stranger who said his
 name was morgan and that he was a
 wandering cowhand had been quickly at-
 tended to in the presence of the cowtown
 crowd

   at the caprocked crest of the first foot-
 hill slope they reached the three reined
 up to give their mounts a breather from
 there they could see the crisscross pat-
 tern of splitrocks roofs down on the edge
 of the basin

   the mob had dispersed from the court-
 house plaza where judge angus mc-
 sherry and his son were guarding the
 jail scofields influence had been respon-
 sible for that something which the slash
 s rancher had been careful to point out
 to the sheriff as they were leaving the
 cowtown on this new and important man-
 hunt

more than ever wayne morgan felt an

 	instinctive distrust of this black-bearded
 ranch owner scofield claimed to have
 seen the masked rider and blue hawk
 within the hour at verde creek canyon
 that was patently impossible even if
 blue hawk had decided to pick the can-
 yon for a hide-out because only an hour
 ago morgan had been en route from the
 seco maduras where he had left his in-
 dian partner from a direction opposite to
 verde creek

   if scofield were honestlymistaken then
 the sheriff would have a long exhausting
 ride for nothing this afternoon if scofield
 was lying seeking to ggt the sheriff out
 of town-why also if the rancher had
 sought to pave the way for mustos
 lynching why had he argued the court-
 house plaza mob into breaking up

  sheriff jennings gathered up his reins
and roweled his buckskin saddle mare
following scofield along the cactus-spined
ridge in a northwesterly direction the
game trace they were following was too
narrow for three men to ride abreast so
wayne morgan rode alongside the split-
rock sheriff letting scofield take the lead
in this heat and in view of the steep
grade they were traveling they kept their
mounts at a jog-trot

  mighty decent of you to ride with me
morgan jennings said stranger here-
abouts aint you

  morgan nodded just drifting through
sheriff like i told you but when i saw
the masked riders gun-rep had the split-
rock crowd buffaloed i thought maybe
you might be able to use an extra pair of
hoglegs

  jeff jennings nodded it aint so much
that the citizens of this county are afraid
to tackle the masked rider he said sour-
ly as it is theyre afraid joaquin mustos
gang of ladrones might raid the town and
try to get musto out of jail and that
would be the worst calamity that could hit
this range

  mustos bunch have given the basin
ranchers a lot of grief in the past i under-
stand morgan said casually

  thats puttin it mild son the sheriff
replied musto has bankrupted two-
three big outfits chousin their beef acrost
the border ambushin line riders poison-
in water-holes only yesterday musto
shot my best friend josh hemingway
made an orphant out of stella heming-
way his daughter lucky for stella she
aims to marry stirrups foreman vol
holcombe but holcombe might be the
musto gangs next target for all she
knows

  they pushed on following scofield for
the better part of a mile before dipping in-
to the brushy maw of a barranca which
led down the scarred slope of the ridge
for the first time since their ride had be-
gun scofield eyed morgan with a cold
calculation

  you volunteered for posse duty so you
could cash in on part of the masked
	masked rider western

riders bounty eh stranger he asked
in an insulting tone

  morgan sensed the hostility of the slash
s boss but was at a loss to account for
his attitude it was almost as if scofield
resented his joining them on this man-
hunt

  if the masked rider is as slippery as i
hear he is i doubt if we capture him
morgan said flatly if we do ill ask for
no part of the reward for him ive heard
men say the masked rider does far more
good than evil scofield

to morgans surprise sheriff jen-
nings was in agreement

  my sentiments exactly morgan
theres plenty of honest folks in arizona
territory that i know personal who claim
the masked rider is on the side o the
underdog

  scofield laughed harshly youre failin
for that robin hood story eh sheriff
sneered the rancher ducking as a mes-
quite branch raked his head and shoul-
ders if the masked rider has done so
much to help folks out how come theres
a two-thousand-dollar reward posted for
his pelt here in the territory

  maybe the masked rider has been
accused of crimes he didnt commit
wayne morgan said casually otherwise
why would outlaws even more than
lawmen all over the country be so eager
to trap him because they know the
masked rider is pledged to fight lawless-
ness if you ask me

  scofield reined up suddenly they were
in the pit of the barranca surrounded by
broken lava walls ahead of them was
a steep climb to top the next ridge and
the three riders took this opportunity to
give their horses a much-needed breather

  you talk like you know the masked
rider personally morgan snapped the
slash s boss sheriff how do we know
but what this stranger is a friend of the
masked riders how do we know he
didnt come with us so as to plug us in
the back when we corner the masked
rider in verde crick canyon

  sheriff jennings piled his gnarled fists

on his dish-shaped irazos saddle-horn
and gave wayne morgan a covert wink

  morgan here looks like an hombre to
ride the river with in my opinion he
said far as thats concerned beggars
cant be choosers when it comes to pickin
posse riders the boys back in town
wasnt so eager to-

  the crash of a gunshot broke into what
the sheriff was saying and a bullet out of
nowhere hit the lava shelf above their
heads tracing a gray smear of lead across
the red rock before ricocheting off into
space

  even as the three riders grabbed reins
to control their panicked horses wayne
morgan spotted a smudge of gunsmoke 
drifting from a fissure in the rocky wall
ahead of him a thought flashed through
the back of his brain

  a neat trap and id bet my bottom
peso scofield knew it was waitin for us

  a guttural voice starkly flavored with
mexican accent sang out from a rimrock
behind them

  manos altos hombres get your hands
up you are surrounded here

  close on the echoes of that voice the
rocks seemed to sprout cone-peaked som-
breros under which the bandanna-masked
faces of their ambushers regarded them
down the barrels of leveled rifles

  ahead of them to the right and left of
them behind them at least seven men
had been crouching like lizards in these
rocks as if knowing in advance the route
scofield would take to reach verde creek
canyon

 joaquin mustos bunch groaned
sheriff jennings lifting his palsied hands
to hatbrim level they must of been
spyin on splitrock waitin for me to leave
town

  their ambushers had as yet made no
move to come farther into the open mor-
gan and scofield like the sheriff got their
arms up knowing the futility of reaching
for guns as long as they were targeted in-
side this ring of weapons

  if is you we are after senor sheriff
the ambushers spokesman called from
some unseen hideout above and behind
the outlaw sheriff	

them senor scofield and the stranger
you are free to ride si but first you will
unbuckle your gun-belts and leave them
behind that goes for your saddle guns
as well senores

lane scofield hastily unbuckled
his cross-draw shell belts and un-
tied the rawhide thongs at the toes of his
basket-woven holsters tossing his six-
guns into the brush the slash s boss gin-
gerly lifted his remington saddle carbine
out of its scabbard and dropped it to the
ground

  better get rid of yore hardware mor-
gan panted the rancher glancing around
to see that the stranger still sat his sad-
dle with arms upraised if these hombres
are mustos men like jeff thinks theyll
quit talkin and start shootin pronto
grinding his jaws in impotent fury
wayne morgan unbuckled his gun har-
ness and tossed his holstered colts into
the brush his winchester - followed

  bueno came the surly voice of the
ambush leader from the rocks you will
ride and keep going senores without
looking back we will turn the sheriff
loose when we are ready

  scofield clapped spurs to his ponys
flanks and headed up the barranca
crouched low in saddle wayne morgan
turned to see the sheriffs eyes regarding
him dully in those eyes morgan read the
litter hopelessness of a man who knew he
had frayed out his string

  sheriff morgan said huskily it goes
against the grain to desert you like this
i-

  jennings braced his bony shoulders and
shook his head

  kite out after scofield before them
tough cases change their minds son
theres nothin you or me can do agin
these odds i got a hunch theyll take me
south of the border and hold me hostage
till joaquin musto is turned loose
reluctantly morgan put his hammer-
head roan forward with a touch of his
spurs

wtynt morgan fired the colt
with incredible swiftness
chap viii


masked rider western

  luck sheriff he called over his
shoulder then was bucking his way
through the thick mesquite hedge which
furred the bottom of the defile

  the dust of scofields flight burned
morgans nostrils as he worked his way to
the peak of the ridge ahead reining up
he glanced back into the pit of the bar-
ranca but could not see the spot where
jeff jennings waited in his trap he rode
on

  on the far side of a bosque of smoke
trees on the ridge crest the heavy breath-
ing of a man and a horse reached mor-
gans ears he passed the trees and came
upon lane scofield slumped in saddle
pulling at the neck of a whisky bottle he
had taken from an alforja bag

  draining the liquor bottle dry scofield
hurled it aside where it fractured with a
spray of amber glass particles on a gabbro
boulder

  that was a close shave scofield
panted as morgan reined up alongside
his stirrup those hombres were mustos
bunch all right no question of it were
lucky they didnt gun us down without
warnin

  morgans brittle eyes bored into the
black-whiskered face of the slash s
rancher with ill-concealed contempt

  weve got to ride back there and give
jennings a hand of course he said mat-
ter-of-factly

  scofield shook his head the whisky
was beginning to fortify his courage now
but riding back down that barranca to
the aid of the beleaugered sheriff had no
part in his plans

  if youre loco enough to buck six-seven
masked bandidos without a gun on your
hip go ahead morgan he sneered me
im lightin out for my home spread
thankin my lucky stars im still alive to
fork a bronc if you got the sense gawd
give a crowbar youll head yonderward
as well morgan

  how about the masked rider deal
morgan asked icily

  scofield shrugged picking up his reins

  i did my duty reportin to the sheriff
like i done dark would catch us before

we got to verde crick canyon anyhow
if we went by way of my spread to pick
up guns i figger the masked rider will
head for the border soon as it gets dark
  hasta la vista morgan

scofield swung his horse around
and headed off along the backbone
of the ridge a quarter of a mile away he
disappeared from sight

 dismounting morgan loosened his
mounts saddle cinch and was plumbing
his saddle-bags on the off chance that he
carried an extra six-gun there when his
ears caught the flatted whipcrack of a
gunshot from the gulch behind him the
sound stiffened morgan sickened him
instantly he knew the meaning of that
sound it was the finish of jeff jennings

  he found no gun in his saddle-bag he
remembered now that his spare weapons
were packed with his masked rider re-
galia back in the canyon where he had
left blue hawk at dawn

  he listened to the sinister echoes of the
rifle report thinning and ebbing in re-
petitive waves of sound off across the
bleak seco madura foothills when the
malpais was silent again wayne morgan
came to his decision

  ive got to go back there and find out
what happened to that sheriff its the
least i can do

chapter iii

voiw to a dying sheriff

ommon sense told morgan
that it was foolhardy to ven-
ture alone and afoot un-
armed and against heavy
odds back to where the sher-
iff had been trapped but it
was not morgans nature to
leave a friend in the lurch in
time of peril even though that friend was
a man he had never seen until a scant two
hours ago even though that friend was a
sheriff who had been riding to capture
morgans own alter ego the masked
rider
the outlaw sheriff	

   leaving his horse ground-tied in the
 smoke tree clump morgan made his way
 back into the thick jungle of chaparral
 working his way as rapidly as possible to-
 ward the scene of the ambush

   he heard a clatter of receding hoof-
 beats ahead of him and knew by that
 sound that mustos riders-if such they
 were-were heading back in the direction
 of splitrock

   sundown made a fiery cauldron behind
 the seco madura peaks and filled this
 barranca with an unnatural half-darkness
 as morgan clawed his way through spiny
 ignota weed and clumps of pear and
 heavy barriers of mesquite and grease-
 wood and when he reached the rocky
 rincon where the masked gunmen had
 halted jennings two-man posse he real-
 ized he was too late to help jeff jennings

   the old mans sprawled body lay on
 the flinty rubble arms outstretched the
 back of his shirt sticky with welling blood
 one stubbled cheek pillowed on a tuft of
 grass jennings saddle horse grazed near-
 by reins dangling a glint of sunset glow
 gleamed on the six-guns and rifles mor-
 gan and scofield had left behind the
 weapons were lying where they had
 dropped them the ambushers had not
 taken the weapons with them

   moving like an automaton morgan
 strapped on his colt harness and picked
  up his winchester a nagging thought
 puzzled him as he walked over to where
 jennings lay what had mustos riders
 accomplished by this killing the sher-
 iff might have been useful to them as a
 hostage to be ransomed only by mustos
 release but the ambushers had canceled
 out that faint chance of saving their
 leader by killing jennings

   kneeling beside the fallen star-toter
 morgan reached down and felt jennings
 wrist to his amazement a pulse still
 ticked faintly beneath the leathery skin
 the sheriff was still alive although he had
 been shot in the spine at point-blanfc
 range

   gently wayne morgan eased the dying
 man over on his back the oldsters dust-
 rimed eyelids quivered opened to reveal

the tortured pools of his time-faded eyes

  recognition glimmered in those pain-
bright orbs jennings wattled throat
worked and a scant whisper broke
through the pink spume which foamed
from his mouth corners

  scofield-back of this-morgan the
pelado who-shot me-bragged-just a-
fore he-pulled trigger-

  morgans jaw sagged open lane sco-
field had engineered this death trap the
deep-seated but instinctive suspicions he
had had of the slash s ranchman had
been grounded in solid truth then

  he bent lower to catch the feeble whis-
per which old jennings was gargling
through the blood which congested his
lungs

 they-aim to-get musto-tonight
morgan theyve already - stole - jail
key warn judge mcsherry-to watch
back door-of courthouse they-could
take musto-without judge knowin-
what went on-

  morgan felt his eyes misting over he
understood why jennings hadnt been
kidnaped now the outlaws had a safer
way to get their chieftain out of jail with
the sheriffs private keys to the back
door and an easy chance to get hold of
the big ring of jail keys mustos rescue
was practically assured and with musto
again on the prowl splitrock basin nd
its people would once more know the
terrors of mustos lawless banditry

  morgan begged the dying lawman
do me-favor unpin-my star hurry-
sand runnin out-fast-

  sure sheriff sure wayne morgan
said gently reaching out to remove the
ball-pointed silver badge from jennings
dusty vest let me get this straight so
i can tell the judge if scofield led you
into this trap then scofield is working
with joaquin mustos border hoppers
is that it

with superhuman effort jeff jen-
nings propped himself up on one
elbow his talonlike fingers clawing the
silver star from morgans grasp

  thats-how it stacks up morgan
	masked rider western

jennings wheezed i was a fool-not to
think of it-fore now scofield-been
after hemingways stirrup ranch-long
enough that must-been why he had
musto-kill old josh yesterday stirrup
would be his-after he got stella-to sell
out-

  with his dying strength jennings
opened his eyes again and peered up at
wayne morgan

  jail-scofield for me son he whis-
pered faintly with this badge of mine-
you can do it-legal promise an old man
-wear his star-long enough to see-sco-
field hang

  jennings feeble hand came up making
stabbing motions at morgans shirt with
the pin of the law badge the pin caught
the fabric just as jennings fingers lost
their grip on the star and as his hand
fell away it left the emblem of the law
dangling from morgans shirt

  sheriff morgan said with a bitter
twisted grin theres something you
ought to know-before i promise to take
over your job im on the dodge myself
i-morgan took a deep breath and spoke
words he had never uttered to a living
man before this-am the masked rider
jennings fell back his head rolling
loosely on the gravel for a moment mor-
gan thought the old mans spirit had fled
his bloody broken body then the eyes
opened again and they were clear and
rational and somehow triumphant

  thanks-for tellin me-morgan jen-
nings said forcing his thin lips into a
smile all the more-reason why-i
want you-wear my star youll be out-
law sheriff-in some folks eyes but not
mine you-you promise me-youll at-
tend to scofield

  gulping hard wayne morgan nodded
  i promise sheriff i-

  he broke off realizing he was speaking
to a dead man reverently removing his
stetson wayne morgan squatted beside
the corpse for a long interval his right
hand automatically fastening the sheriffs
star against his own shirt

  then suddenly he snapped out of it
at this moment the sheriffs killer was

headed for splitrock armed with jen-
nings courthouse keys which would give
him access to the jail keys and bent on
releasing joaquin musto from custody
there was no time to be lost

  it was full dark by the time morgan
made the return trip from the top of the
ridge on his hammerhead roan he had
tarried to rope jennings corpse jackknife
fashion across the sheriffs own saddle
then trailing jennings buckskin by a
hackamore dallied over his saddle-horn
morgan had headed back down the bar-
ranca in the direction of splitrock

  tangled impressions tried to sort them-
selves out into some kind of logical se-
quence in morgans mind as he rode
through the star-dusted night had it not
been for the dead man bobbing on the
buckskin behind him and the feel of the
tin star on his own shirt this whole epi-
sode would have seemed like a nightmare
some unreal figment of his subconscious
which tomorrows dawn would fade

  as it was wayne morgan had found
himself the sheriff of splitrock basin by
virtue of his solemn oath to his dying
predecessor he wondered if blue hawk
keeping vigil back in the hills was worry-
ing about his failure to return by sun-
down in his wildest imaginings the ya-
qui would never dream that wayne mor-
gan was now an officer of the law pledged
to avenge a lawmans killing

  true there was nothing to prevent
morgan from cutting jennings mare
adrift the buckskin would return to her
home stall in splitrock with the homing
instinct of her kind tomorrow at the
latest the town would know that their
sheriff had been bushwhacked out in the
hills

but what of scofield the instigator of
this drygulching if not its actual
perpetrator and what if joaquin musto
were missing from the jail when morgan
got back to town with musto on the
loose again human life would be endan-
gered throughout the basin it was ap-
palling to contemplate

  as the lights of splitrock appeared in
the outlaw sheriff



the distance morgan realized that he now
had a mission made to order for the
masked rider that black-clad avenger
was devoting his energies to helping the
downtrodden and oppressed peoples of
the west surely no more challenging
task had ever confronted him in his self-
appointed crusade as a robin hood out-
law of the frontier

 approaching the cowtown from the
south morgan hitched his roan and the
buckskin carrying the dead jennings in
the rear of the courthouse plaza he had

was probably carousing in saloons and
gambling dens waiting for news of their
sheriff and his trek into the seco maduras
in search of the masked rider

  as morgan reached the top of the court-
house steps a harsh voice from the sher-
iffs office window halted him

  go back where you come from waddy
nobodys allowed around the jailhouse
until the sheriff gets back

  morgan halted his eyes probing the
darkness of the office doorway from
whence the challenge had come he knew

                      blue hawk

returned to splitrock with all the speed at
his command but he was oppressed by a
sense of time running out on him by a
fear that he had reached splitrocks jail
too late

  climbing the plaza wall morgan made
his way along the brick wall of the court-
house and up the front steps where this
afternoon an aroused mob of cowmen had
called upon jeff jennings to release musto
for hangrope vengeance

  those steps were empty now further
down the street the erstwhile lynch mob

that he was covered with a shotgun a
shotgun with taut-nerved fingers crooked
around the double triggers

  judge mcsherry he called

  this is luke mcsherry the judge is
restin what do you want with my dad

  morgan reached in his chaps pocket and
drew out a match thumbnaiung it into
flame he let the judges son get a good
look at the law badge on his shirt

  oh-youre deputy briggs from bor-
der city eh luke mcsherry said from
the darkness we got the telegram sayin
masked rider western



youd come-

  morgan decided to let that deception
pass for the moment

  understand youve got joaquin musto
behind bars he said

  young mcsherry laughed with pride
yeah briggs

  morgan flipped the burned-out match
aside and stepped closer to the door of the
sheriffs office

  id like to have a look at musto if i
may mcsherry

  sure mr briggs morgan heard the
sound of a key turning in a lock and the
creak of jennings office door opening
dad luke called into the darkness
take over the door will you deputy
from border city is here to have a look at
our catch

  morgan stepped into the sheriffs office
he heard the springs of a cot squeak as
judge mcsherry got to his feet and
struck a match which he applied to the
wick of a lantern on jennings battered
rolltop desk

  the white-headed old judge reached
for his shotgun leaning against the wall
and was lifting it as he turned to get his
first look at the new arrival instantly the
old scotsmans eyes screwed together
under cottony brows as his glance shot
from morgans face to the law badge
pinned to his shirt

  then with an incredibly swift move
for so old a man the cowtown judge
whipped up his shotgun and leveled it at
the dust-covered young waddy who stood
beside luke mcsherry

  this is a trick luke judge mcsherry
rasped out his voice carrying the burr
of his native argyllshire this isnt
deputy sheriff briggs its the man jen-
nings swore in to ride with his posse this
afternoon-and thats the sheriffs own
star hes wearing shut the door and
bolt it

chapter iv

scofields story

jke mcsherry a clean-
cut young giant in his early
twenties leaped to obey his
fathers order wayne mor-
gan drew a deep breath and
elevated his arms as he felt
luke jerk his colt s from
holsters

  i can explain judge morgan said
the sheriff-

  mcsherry gestured with his shotgun
toward the cell door

  youll do your explainin in a cell net
to joaquin mustos stranger he snarled
mighty clever try at wormin past our
blockade posin as a deputy from border
city

  luke mcsherry obviously embarrassed
for having admitted an impostor stepped
to the cell block door and opened it

  i just hope morgan drawled that
well find senor musto in his cell judge

  luke picked up the lantern and stepped
into the cell corridor morgan followed
with the judges shotgun prodding his
spine

 the next instant young mcsherry
halted in his tracks lifting his lantern to
reveal the wide-open door of a comer
cell from the massive lock of which
protruded a ring of keys

  dad choked luke this feller was
right mustos gone hes broke jail-
and with the sheriffs own keys

  wayne morgan shared the despair of
his captors if not their surprise the
dying sheriff had figured his killers plans
correctly while the mcsherrys guarded
the front of the jail mustos henchmen
had entered the courthouse from the rear
using the stolen keys had slipped into the
sheriffs private office for the big ring of
jail keys and had rescued joaquin musto
from under the very noses of his guards
separated from the cell corridor only by
the thickness of a single door

  judge mcsherrys sharp whisper broke
into morgans thoughts
the outlaw sheriff	

  i think i know how this thing hap-
pened luke this man here must have
killed jeff jennings and lane scofield
and stole the sheriffs keys while he was
stalling us out front this mans pards
sneaked in through the back of the court-
house and unlocked mustos cell

  wayne morgan turned to face his two
accusers the light of the lantern in lukes
trembling fist shedding spears of yellow
light from jennings law badge on his
shirt

  youre partly right judge he said
earnestly but scofield is the guilty
hombre not me as for the sheriff youll
find his body tied to his saddle behind
the plaza fence i brought him in from
the hills where mustos owlhooters bush-
whacked the three of us and-

  for a long moment after morgan fin-
ished speaking a steely silence ran its
course in the jail then judge mcsherry
still holding his shotgun on morgan
snapped a command to luke

  go out back and see if the sheriffs
body is out there luke and keep a
stirrup eye peeled for musto and his
bunch for all we know they may still
be inside this courthouse

  luke mcsherry left the cell block
through the rear door which was signifi-
cantly unlocked this door connected
with judge mcsherrys private chambers
off the courtroom mustos outlaws there-
fore had gained entry to the courthouse
through the judges own office and slipped
from there to the sheriffs private office
adjoining

  following lukes departure wayne
morgan recounted in detail to the judge
the circumstances of the posse ambush
scofields flight and his own talk with the
dying sheriff

  im just a saddle tramp driftin
through this corner of the territory
judge morgan concluded so i dont
know too much about your local politics
maybe you believe lane scofield is too
honest to have any underground alliance
with mustos owlhooters you have only
my word for what jennings told me at the
end but with his own hand jennings

pinned his star to my shirt he died with
my pledge in his ears to bring scofield to
justice

mcsherrys mouth hardened be-
hind his screening mustache

  youre a liar morgan youre trvin
to soft-soap your way out of a tight if
jennings was killed you did it your
cornin to the front door was just a blind
to cover up while your pards got musto
out of his cell you-

  the rear door of the cell block opened
and luke mcsherry came in ashen-faced

  its true dad two hosses hitched out
back sheriffs roped to one of em shot
in the back

  judge mcsherry sighed heavily he
gestured with his gun muzzle toward the
open door of mustos cell

  get inside there morgan the old
judge ordered wearily if musto had
been smart hed have hung onto them
keys so as to come back and save your
bacon you might as well know that i
dont believe one jot or tittle of this tall
tale of yours

  frustration surged up in wayne mor-
gan he could understand mcsherrys
mistaken attitude toward him but he
knew that once he was behind bars he
might be railroaded to the gallows ac-
cused of jennings murder

  young luke sharing his fathers hos-
tility toward their prisoner lunged for-
ward with a hand outstretched with the
intention of ripping jennings star off
morgans shirt

  but in that instant fate intervened
from an unexpected quarter the three
men heard the hard slam of running cow- 
boots mounting the courthouse steps and
crossing the portico it was followed by a
hard-hammering fist on the door of the
sheriffs office from out of the night
came an urgent shout

  open up judge mcsherry its me
lane scofield i got bad news for you
the three men inside the jail broke
their frozen tableau to spin about and
stare through the open door of the sher-
iffs office to where scofield was knocking
	masked rider western

for admission

  keep morgan covered son rasped
the judge picking up the lantern maybe
scofields story will jibe with morgans
the cell corridor went semi-dark as
judge mcsherry strode into the front
office calling sharply

  just a minute scofield

  luke mcsherry had a pair of six-guns
trained on wayne morgans brisket now
both men were nerve-taut with suspense
as they watched the venerable judge un-
lock the front door to admit the slash s
rancher hatless and smelling of trail
dust and horse sweat

  whats your bad news lane the
judge demanded as scofield lurched
across the threshold and flung himself
into a chair beside the door lungs heaving
with exertion

  our posse run into an ambush out in
the hills just afore sundown judge
scofield gusted youd never guess who
jumped the sheriff and that morgan cow-
punch and me

 mustos outlaw gang judge mc-
sherry said acidly

  scofield shook his head nope the
masked rider and his injun pardner
thats who the pair we was ridin out to
capture and that aint the worst of it
judge the masked rider shot and killed
the sheriff in cold blood

  wayne morgan felt his senses reel sco-
fields story was too fantastic to make
sense even to judge mcsherry

  so-o muttered the judge fingering
his beard thoughtfully that would in-
dicate that the masked rider is working
with joaquin mustos gang then

  scofield shrugged mopping his hot face
with a bandanna

  i reckon thats how it stacks up come
to think of it anyhow the masked rider
didnt have any bone to chaw with me
luckily he told me to rattle my hocks
i did-and lit a shuck back here to report
what happened judge

  wayne morgan held his breath as he
waited for what the shrewd scotsman
would say next

  you say the masked rider let you

go free how about wayne morgan that
stranger the sheriff deputized to x-ide with
you

time seemed to stand still for wayne
morgan standing in the clotted shad-
ows of the cell block as he waited for
scofields answer on it might depend his
own freedom perhaps his life

morgan scofield echoed oh he lit
a shuck too seems the masked rider
wasnt out to ambush nobody but jeff
judge mcsherry bent a close stare on
the slash s rancher

  whered this morgan go

  scofields shoulders lifted and fell
how do i know last i saw of him he
was gallopin into the hills like the devil
was after him with a hot pitchfork hes
probly halfway to flagstaff by now the
way he was ridin

 judge mcsherry waggled his head
plumb interesting he muttered sco-
field ive known you man and boy since
before the days you and joshua heming-
way homesteaded your two ranches out in
coyotero canyon so i reckon i got to
accept your story of what happened to
jeff lifting his voice the judge called
luke bring in our prisoner i want
scofield to see him

  morgan had been waiting for this he
strode out of the cell corridor into the
full glare of the lantern and into lane
scofields range of vision sight of mor-
gan seemed to grip the slash s rancher in
the chains of paralysis

  im glad you told the judge that the
masked rider turned me loose scofield
drawled morgan otherwise he might
have decided i was the masked rider
for a dozen clock-ticks scofield stared
at the law badge pinned to morgans vest
that star told a plain story to scofield
the rancher knew that morgan had re-
turned to the scene of jennings death
and had brought back a version of the
sheriffs killing to mcsherry which made
no mention of the masked rider

  heres something to think over sco-
field morgan went on jennings wasnt
dead when i got to him he lived long
the outlaw sheriff



enough to tell me that youre working
with musto that you-

  with a choked gasp scofield bounced
to his feet then with a draw too swift to
follow a draw which caught even morgan
by total surprise scofield yanked a hide-
out gun from a holster under his calfhide
vest

  stand as you are the three of you he
snarled swinging his bisley  to cover
luke mcsherry in the cell corridor door
behind morgan drop your hardware
luke im takin over from here on
luke mcsherrys six-guns made a
clattering noise as he dropped them to the
floor the judge had leaned his shotgun
against the sheriffs desk and a move to-
ward the weapon now would be sure sui-
cide in scofield they faced a trapped and
guilty man who would stop at nothing

  all right panted scofield morgan
outfoxed me ridin back here so the
masked rider didnt drygulch the sheriff
 well now you three know that mustos
on the loose youve guessed that i worked
that jail-break judge but the three of
you wont live to let splitrock know the
truth about me

  kill-lust was coming to a boil in sco-
fields slitted eyes it was obvious that the
cornered outlaw planned to shoot all three
of them down at point-blank range in the
coming seconds

  judge mcsherry made an audacious
bid to turn the tables without warning
the old man flung his right arm around
to knock the lantern off the desk in-
stantly the office was engulfed in dark-
ness

  scofields gun spat an orange needle of
flame through the murk his bullet miss-
ing the judge to slam into the door of the
sheriffs safe as old angus mcsherry
dropped floorward

  simultaneously with the shattering of
the lantern wayne morgan launched him-
self like a projectile at the bayed rancher
his dive carried him under the hot blast
of scofields  powder grains scalding
the back of his neck as morgans rocky
shoulder caught scofield at knee height

  scofield went down bellowing like a
wounded bull he felt morgans hand
close on his gun wrist with the crushing
pressure of a vise felt morgans other
elbow hook around his throat with a
strangling force

chapter v

stella hemingway

or a brief interval the
two antagonists struggled
viciously scofields superior
bulk making him an even
match for morgan in spite of
his throttling hold

  then a match flared in the
judges hand and luke mc-
sherry moved in fast with a scooped-up
revolver gunmetal lifted and fell in a
chopping blow to scofields head wayne
morgan felt the traitorous slash s rancher
wilt in his grasp

masked rider western

gers judge mcsherry lit the lamp on the
desk its glare revealed a seep of blood
from the gash on the ranchers scalp

  morgan panted the splitrock judge
luke and me have some apologizin to
do we almost made a terrible mistake
morgan grinned his thanks

  we cant forget that scofield has the
power of mustos gang behind him he
said seriously if word should reach the
bandits that weve got scofield in jail
here musto could cause a lot of blood-
shed trying to rescue him

 mcsherry rummaged in a drawer of
the desk and produced a pair of handcuffs
notching them over scofields wrists while
he pondered what morgan had said as
he looked up it was to see his son re-
turning to wayne morgan his colt s

  i think morgan repeated it wouldnt
be wise to keep scofield here in split-
rock

  morgan luke said youre wearin
jennings star so far as im concerned
that means youre the sheriff here but
if you think itd be dangerous to keep
scofield in this calaboose what do you
suggest we do with the varmint

  morgan did not answer immediately
his mind was wandering he was remem-
bering that blue hawk waiting for him
out in the seco madura foothills must by
now be in a high state of anxiety won-
dering if morgan had fallen into the hands
of the law

  eh said morgan snapping back to
reality well luke i may be the sheriff
of this county for the time being as you
say but im a stranger on this range
right now frankly i am tuckered for
some grub under my belt while im out
rustling up something to eat i suggest
that you and your father figure up some
place where we can hide scofield some
spot where joaquin mustos wild bunch
wont dream of looking

  leaving the courthouse morgan lo-
cated a chinese restaurant on a side
street refreshed from his first really
hearty meal in nearly five days morgan
returned to the main street on his way
back to the jail he saw a light glowing

inside the border mercantile and was
reminded of the supplies he had ordered
there

  entering the store morgan spotted its
owner playing solitaire at a back counter
the loquacious storekeeper glanced up
recognized his customer and came to his
feet

  well say he greeted morgan when
i seen you and lane scofield ridin off
with the sheriff after that masked rider
buscadero i wasnt shore if youd ever
be back after your order but there she
is on the counter yonder tots up to
twenty-eight dollars and some-odd cents

   say stranger did you have any luck
catchin up with that masked rider if
you did reckon youll cash in quite a
considerable jackpot of reward dinero

  the oldster stopped his babbling for
sheer want of breath

  morgan dropped two gold pieces on the
counter accepted his change and grinned
at the storekeepers question was it pos-
sible that only a few hours had elapsed
since he had given this man his list mor-
gan had experienced a lifetime of des-
perate adventure in that short interval

  no luck sorry to say he grinned
shouldering that gunny-sack full of sup-
plies which was waiting for him on the
counter the masked rider had flown
the coop when we got there

  the storekeeper caught sight of the
sheriffs badge on his customers shirt

  say he said excitedly you a john-
ny law stranger you aint a prospector
after all eh

  but wayne morgan had vanished into
the night

heading for the courthouse he
went to the rear of the plaza where
his hammer-head roan was hitched along
with the sheriffs buckskin and its grisly
burden he tied his sack of supplies to
the can tie and then returned to the jail
office

  lane scofield was still unconscious on
the floor judge mcsherry and luke
were awaiting morgans return in grim-
lipped silence
the outlaw sheriff	

   well weve thought of a place to hold
 scofield where mustos gang wont think
 to look morgan the judge said out at
 hemingways ranch the stirrup south
 end of coyotero canyon-couple hours
 ride from here old josh had a stone-
 walled root cellar where we could hold
 scofield till doomsday without mustos
 bunch finding it out

   you can trust whoever is living at the
 stirrup ranch to keep our secret mor-
 gan said dubiously

   luke mcsherry grinned sure his
 foreman hombre named vol holcombe
 ill ride out to stirrup with you and the
 prisoner morgan nobody in splitrockll
 be any the wiser on a dark night like
 this

  judge mcsherry winked at morgan
 my son is sweet on joshs daughter
 stella thats why hes so anxious to
 ride out to hemingways ranch with you
 tonight morgan the sad fact of the mat-
 ter is that stella is engaged to marry vol
 holcombe

   morgan grinned impatiently he was
 anxious to hit the trail not only to get
 lane scofield out of splitrock before
 joaquin mustos bunch got wind of sco-
 fields fate but also to pay a visit to his
 yaqui partner at their secret camp in the
 foothills and turn the supply sack over
 to blue hawk

	ill take the sheriffs body over to the
 coroners morgue after you leave the
 judge said lukes got horses saddled up
 out in the county stables for himself and
 scofield reckon you two better hit the
 saddle without any more delay

   luke mcsherry and morgan picked up
 scofields inert weight and carried him
 out to the county barn in one corner of
 the courthouse plaza ten minutes later
 they were jogging acros the rolling dunes
 of the starlit desert scofield tied to the
 saddle and still unconscious

   morgan was pleased to note that coyo-
 tero canyon and the hemingway ranch
 where scofield would be turned over to
 vol holcombes custody was in the same
 general direction as blue hawks camp
 within an hours riding from splitrock

they sighted the frosty glitter of lighted
bunkhouse windows down in the broad
valley of the coyotero which luke mc-
sherry identified as scofields home ranch
the slash s further south where coyo-
tero canyon widened as it crossed the
mexican border gleamed the lights of
the stirrup ranchhouse josh heming-
way the owner of that ranch had been
killed by joaquin musto only yesterday

  another hours ride down the valley
floor brought them within hailing dis-
tance of the stirrup as young mcsherry
pointed out it would be dangerous to
ride up to the ranch at midnight without
identifying themselves since heming-
ways bushwhacking the stirrup cow-
hands would have jittery trigger fingers

  vol holcombe the stirrup ramrod
answered mcsherrys hail a few mo-
ments later wayne morgan and the
judges son were dismounting at the front
gate before the hemingway ranchhouse

  scofield was conscious now he was
mumbling curses under his breath as he
struggled with the rawhide bonds which
tied his legs together under the horses
barrel and his wrists to the saddle-horn

  with vol holcombe at the gate was a
girl of twenty wearing a doeskin riding
skirt mans hickory shirt and cleft-crown
stetson the fanwise spread of light from
the stirrup windows put a halo on the
girls wheat-colored curls and outlined
the supple curves of her young body

  whats this luke stella heming-
way gasped out as she recognized their
prisoner i-i thought when i saw you
had a prisoner maybe youd captured
musto

tj ol holcombe stood with his arm
w around the girl a fact which wayne
morgan was quick to notice roused a
jealous wrath in luke mcsherry he re-
membered what the judge had said re-
garding the daughter of the murdered
hemingway luke sherry might be in
love with this cowgirl but she was already
betrothed to the handsome young fore-
man of stirrup vol holcombe and seem-
ed to see only him


masked rider western

  why its lane scofield gasped hol-
combe staring up at the twisted visage of
his black-whiskered neighbor whats the
idea of hog tying him like this luke

  after introducing wayne morgan to
stella and holcombe as the new sheriff of
splitrock basin luke mcsherry told
them briefly of the events which had led
up to their nocturnal visit here

  sooner or later joaquin musto will
know something has happened to scofield
when he dont show up at the slash s
holcombe morgan said to the stirrup
foreman i have a hunch musto will pay
a visit to the splitrock jail in hopes were
holdin scofield prisoner there if he does
ill be waiting to arrest musto or whoever
he sends across the border until then
i want scofield kept here without any-
body knowin it the judge tells me you
have a root cellar which will do right nice
as a jail

  vol holcombe stood staring up at his
rancher neighbor as if unable to believe
his ears or eyes then as understanding
slowly filtered into his brain the stirrup
foremans face twisted with mounting
anger

  ill ride herd on this skunk dont
worry about that he ground out musto
killed stellas dad in cold blood yester-
day if scofield wears mustos collar then
hes as guilty as musto ill see you hang
lane-

  scofield replied with bitter curses as
morgan and luke mcsherry untied his
bonds and pulled him from saddle

  stella hemingway gave way suddenly
to a strangled cry and fled back to the
ranchhouse slamming the door behind
her

  purty tough on stel muttered luke
mcsherry she ought to ride back to
town with us tonight vol and stay with
my folks until after her dads funeral to-

coming next issue-	

 wild challenge
 by burl tuttle

and many other stories

morrow afternoon she-

  holcombe cut in with a sarcastic laugh
never give up tryin to steal my girl
eh luke sneered the stirrup foreman
he turned to morgan leaving mcsherry
flushing furiously well sheriff no use
wastin your time at this hour of the
night the root cellar is back of the
house

  wayne morgan made a careful inspec-
tion of the root cellar after the bluster-
ing slash s rancher had been placed in-
side and the door locked the structure
was an adequate prison having thick
stone walls a sheet iron roof and no
windows

  after making sure that holcombe had
locked the door securely morgan climbed
back up the steps to rejoin the stirrup
foreman and his rival for stellas hand
luke mcsherry

  i sure hope musto walks into your
trap at the town jail holcombe said
grimly nothing would please me more
than to see musto and scofield hangin
from the same tree

  morgan was well aware that the fol-
lowing hours might see holcombe de-
velop an infuriated intent to kill scofield
and he took pains to caution the foreman
as to his duty

  dont let a soul know were holding
this man prisoner morgan emphasized
for all you know some of your own
crew might bp in mustos pay

  they started walking back to the house
where stella had taken refuge

  i trust my men holcombe said but
ill keep my mouth shut that skunk will
get fed bread and water and no more
rrmember cautioned morgan if
any harm should come to scofield while
im away ill hold you responsible under
the law is that thoroughly understood
holcombe

  the stirrup foreman grimaced in the
darkness

  itll be tough feedin that polecat and
such like but you can depend on me
sheriff ill see to it that scofield is
healthy enough to appear in court when
judge mcsherry calls for the prisoner

         chapter vi

mustos spy

organ and luke mcsherry
left the stirrup ranch head-
ing back toward splitrock
ish	young luke was in low

             sprts due more to thwarted
             romance than to the grim
             events in which hed had a
             hand tonight

  cheer up son morgan said and
laughed sympathetically stella aint the
only seniorita hereabouts with your
good looks-

  luke cut him off with a bitter oath
what makes me mad morgan is that
stella dont love that holcombe iigger
and i know it

  she was wearing his ring i noticed
sure to please her father old josh
hired holcombe when he was knee-high
to the loadin gate of a winchester brung
vol and stella up like brother and sister
always wanted stel to marry holcombe
so as to have holcombe to run stirrup
after josh died but she dont love hol-
combe the way she ought to love a man to
marry him i wont quit courtin her until
theyre hitched

  topping the east ridge overlooking
coyotero canyon the outlaw sheriff
reined up and spoke briefly to mcsherry
you ramble along by yourself from
here on luke im going to spend the
rest of the night scouting this chunk of
border

  luke sherry hipped around in saddle
his love affair forgotten in the anxiety he
now revealed for morgans safety

  dont be a loco fool sheriff joaquin
mustos hard cases make a habit of prowl-
in this strip of border in the dark of
the moon like tonight scoutin for beef to
rustle one look at that star on yore
brisket and youd be dead

  morgan was adamant sheriffs orders
luke tell your father ill see him in
town manana

  when the hoofbeats of mcsherrys de-
parture faded in the night wayne mor-



gan swung his own mount toward the
southeast and spurred into a long lope

  ill be lucky if blue hawk remembers
me when i get back to camp he mut-
tered ive been so long getting back
with his grub   

  back at the stirrup ranch following
the departure of morgan and mcsherry
vol holcombe did not shuck his boots and
clothing and hit the blankets though the
hour was late and he was tired from a
days range riding holcombe being fore-
man on the stirrup had his living quar-
ters in a lean-to built against the bunk-
house some hundred yards from the
hemingway ranchhouse

  he squatted in the door of the lean-to
keeping an eye on the lighted window of
stella hemingways room in the main
house when it finally went dark hol-
combe surreptitiously headed for the
barn and with speed threw a saddle on
a close-coupled sorrel gelding

  holcombe led the horse a good quarter
of a mile away from the ranch before
mounting spurring to a full gallop
then he headed due south toward the
drift fence marking the stirrups bound-
ary and the mexican line

  reaching the fence holcombe opened a
gate and rode on into mexican territory
a mile below the border the stirrup fore-
man reined into the narrow mouth of an
arroyo and gave the pony its head the
speed with which holcombes mount
threaded its way through the complete
blackness of an invisible trail indicated
that the animal was thoroughly familiar
with the route

  deep in the throat of the arroyo hol-
combe pulled up his horse as a sharp
voice in spanish challenged him from a
lookout post on the rim

  que vaf who goes

  holcombe senor musto is at the
casa

  there sounded a furtive movement of
a sentry shifting position on the rimrock
shale causing a tiny avalanche of pebbles
to clatter down into the arroyos chapar-
ral

  si amigo the unseen sentinel spoke


masked rider western

in guttural border jargon our com-
paneros are celebrating with tequila to-
night celebrating joaquins return from
the gringo jail es verdad

fifty yards further on the arroyo
took a sharp turn and vol holcombe
saw lamplight blazing behind the cur-
tained windows of a rock-and-adobe
structure built at the foot of the low
cliff forming one flank of this arroyo

  horses whickered in peeled-pole cor-
rals flanking the trail saddle leather
creaked as holcombe dismounted looped
his reins over an unseen hitchrack and
strode toward the casita the strumming
of a guitar inside the shack was barely
audible above the deep liquor-slurred
voices of the revelers within

  holcombe jerked the rawhide latch
string and stepped into a solid wall of
tobacco smoke pulque fumes and the
reek of unwashed bodies the room was
packed with mexicans gringo renegades
swarthy mestizos all in gaucho garb with
heavy accents of silver-mounted gun hol-
sters gilded spurs chap conchas made of
mexican dobe dollars

  assembled in this well-hidden casa deep
in the mexican hills was the bulk of
joaquin mustos owlhoot legion every
man in this room packed a reward on his
scalp and a summary of their crimes
would have included everything in the
book from killing to cattle rustling bank
robbery and kidnaping here were dope
smugglers and horse thieves ex-convicts
and petty criminals and every man was
in some degree of intoxication

  dominating the group was musto him-
self half-indian half-sonoran a giant
for size ie was decked out in the same
resplendent ball-tasseled sombrero gold-
braided charro jacket and green velve-
teen pantalones that he had been wearing
when jeff jennings had marched him
down the main street of splitrock
shackled and empty-holstered charged
with killing joshua hemingway in ad-
dition to a score of other major crimes

  mustos reptilian eyes held the high
shine that came from too much tequila

his teeth made a white shining under hi
ropy black mustache his smile widening
as he caught sight of vol holcombes pale
taut face in the doorway

  hold our amioo from stirrun rancho
welcome to our fiesta don vol

  holcombe made a beckoning gesture
with his head inviting musto to step out-
side the gravity in the arizonians face
brousht a sudden end to the guitar music
and the flow of drunken merriment which
pervaded the room

  theres heck to pay north of the line
joaquin holcombes brittle voice came
through the filtering smoke clouds pan-
cho and heraclio bungled the sheriffs
drygulching jennings did some talking
before he cashed in his chips lane sfco-
field is under arrest as a member of your
gang

  it was a long speech for the taciturn
holcombe the impact of his revelation
brought a deathly hush to the celebrants

  joaquin musto pulled himself to his
feet his grinning lips suddenly flabby and
soft the arrest of lane scofield might
be a serious blow to mustos dream of
becoming the master of this section of the
mexican border

  muttering a spanish oath the outlaw
chieftain lurched to the door and stepped
out into the chill night with vol hol-
combe there speaking rapidly in mustos
tongue the stirrup foreman told his story
of the new sheriff who had replaced the
martyred jeff jennings winding up with
scofields imprisonment in the stirrup
cellar and morgans scheme to lay a trap
for musto in the jail at splitrock

  this senor morgan-who is he
mustos first words proved to holcombe
that the outlaw was stone sober now

  quien sabe hes bad medicine any
way we look at it

  musto tugged at his greasy mustache

  you have set my amigo scofield free
no

  i thought id better get your permis-
sion on that musto itll be hard to ex-
plain his escape to stella and if im to
marry her and get control of stirrup so
that we can merge the ranch with sco-
the outlaw sheriff



fields slash s and give you a made-to-
order smuggling route into arizona
stella has got to be handled easy

chapter vii

m

cjsto stared hard at his gringo ac-
complice

  the senorita stella will marry you
no

  holcombe shrugged i wouldnt gam-
ble on it it was joshs idea more than it
was hers you know wouldnt surprise
me none if she threw me over for that
luke mcsherry hombre in which case
ill never get my hooks on hemingways
spread

  musto gave his cartridge-filled belts an
angry hitch

  we will ride back to stirrup si the
outlaw decided we will turn scofield
loose and i will ride on to slash s before
it gets daylight amigo you did well to
come here and tell me what has hap-
pened

  an hour later joaquin musto and vol
holcombe were hitching their horses in
the chaparral which grew to within fifty
yards of the stirrup ranchhouse hem-
ingways cowboys were sound asleep in
the bunkhouse the ranch dogs had not
caught their scent and would recognize
the foreman anyhow

  like ghostly shadows under the stars
the two conspirators headed over to the
dim bulk of the rock-walled root cellar
and descended the steps it took only a
moment for holcombe to get the padlock
open lane scofield wearing handcuffs
stepped out of the stuffy prison

  took you a long time to get me out
vol he complained i was beginnin to
wonder if you aimed to doublecross me

  musto shook scofields shackled hands

  we will ride to your rancho amigo
we can strike off these wrist irons at your
blacksmith shop

  scofield took an uneasy glance toward
the east rim of coyotero canyon day-
light was beginning to unfurl its pink
banners across the jagged horizon of the
further peaks wed better hurry then
cant let daylight catch you ridin this
side of the border musto

at blue hawks camp

rv rjol holcombe turned to
l head for his lean-to behind
a y the stirrup bunkhouse when
  scofields escape was dis-
covered he knew he would
have some tall explaining to
do stella hemingway knew
that holcombe had the only
keys to the root cellar

  musto and scofield headed for the
chaparral where the horses were waiting
to take them on to the slash s this trip
was vital for several pack loads of mus-
tos contraband were stored in scofields
house

  and after today scofield would be
unable to show his face at the slash s
now that his criminal secret was out

  they were passing the rear corner of
the root cellar when a figure leaped from
the shadows there with an inarticulate
cry

  like a quail flushed from a thicket
the figure sped in the direction of the
ranchhouse then veered toward the barn

  with a startled grunt musto whipped
out a gun and took aim to shoot down the
unknown person who had eavesdropped
on their conversation with scofield the
slash s boss reached out to grab mustos
gun before he could fire

  dont you fool a shot would bring
hemingways waddies storming out of the
bunkhouse that was stella

  musto jerked his gun out of scofields
grasp the senorita knows we turned
you loose snarled the outlaw she must
die-

  a rataplan of hoofs rang out from the
direction of the corrals stella heming-
way who for some reason had been
abroad in the night and had seen scofields
rescue was now riding-bareback most
likely-in the direction of splitrock and
the law

  vol holcombe came running up to join
musto and scofield

who was that who just rode off


masked rider western

  stella scofield said bitterly youll
never marry her now holcombe shes
on her way to tell wayne morgan what
she saw here shes got to be stopped
or our whole scheme is ruined-

  ill ride after stel and gun her down
vol holcombe snarled dont worry
about that shell go by the road ill
take a short cut over the ridge and head
her off

  holcombe raced off in the direction of
the cavvy corral   

  in the dull light of the false dawn
wayne morgan and his yaqui partner
blue hawk were breakfasting from the
supplies which morgan had picked up in
splitrock

  their camp was a well-concealed rin-
con near the crest of a ridge which in
daylight afforded a far-flung vista of
splitrock basin with the cowtown itself
a hazy smudge some ten miles to the
northeast

  water burbled from a spring in the
rocks a few yards away grazing in the
lush bluestem grass were the four horses
with which these adventure riders tra-
veled there was midnight the demon
black stallion which the masked rider
rode the hammerhead roan which was
wayne morgans mount when in the role
of a drifting cowpuncher blue hawks
powerful gray and their pinto pack-horse

  even while wolfing down a much-
needed meal blue hawk made an im-
pressive figure pure-blooded yaqui blue
hawk had a fine copper-hued face
chiseled on the bold craggy lines indica-
tive of his tribe a crimson bandeau
circled the glossy blue-black hair which
hung in twin braids over his shoulders
a lone eagle feather denoted his tribal
rank

  he wore white drill pants and shirt
beaded buckskin moccasins and a belt

from which depended a sheathed knife
a wizard with the white mans tools of
destruction six-gun or rifle blue hawk
had an indians skill with tomahawk and
bow a quiver of steel-tipped arrows was
an important part of the pack he carried
with him

  educated in a mission school this yaqui
was a linguist speaking his own and a
dozen other indian tongues as well as
spanish he was a master at trailcraft a
devoted companion and faithful foil to the
masked rider and as such the only man
living who knew the dual role which
this robin hood outlaw played from
border to border and from the pecos to
the pacific even so he did not know the
real name of the man of mystery and had
never asked

a glint of humor was in blue
hawks obsidian-black eyes now as
he commented to morgan

  it is strange senor to see you wearing
a sheriffs badge senor was the only
name by which he ever addressed his
trail companion

  morgan grinned appreciating the hu-
mor of the weird situation as fully as did
his yaqui partner

  but a necessary thing hawk he said
if i am to erase the shadows of terror
which this joaquin musto gang has put
over the innocent people of splitrock
basin weve never tackled a more im-
portant bit of work than this one which
finds me-of all things-a law officer
morgan got to his feet and headed for
the spring where he saddled up his roan
for his return trip to splitrock blue
hawk followed him noiseless on his moc-
casined feet

  i am to have no part in helping rid
the basin of this diablo musto senor
he asked

  hawk amigo i know its hard for you
to wait here in camp this way morgan
said but it might embarrass me in the
eyes of the town to have to account for
an indian partner splitrock is already
on tenterhooks sure that the marked
rider is lurking somewhere in this ter-
ritory for the time being all i can tell
you is to keep a close watch all the time
from the top of the ridge were in dan-
gerous country if you should be cornered
either by mustos riders or by sheriffs
posse take midnight and the other horses
and get across into mexico ill join you
at our old hide-out in the caliente moun-
tains as soon as i have turned in jen-
nings badge on this case see you later
hawk

  a flaming dawn was just breaking over
the eastern peaks when wayne morgan
topped the ridge and headed toward the
flashing window panes of splitrock

  at the foot of the seco maduras he was
obliged to make a wide swing to the west
in order to avoid the deep pit of an old
sandstone quarry which lay in his direct
path to the cowtown once beyond that
abyss he put the roan into a gallop and
was soon on the level floor of the desert

  he had just reached the section-line
stage road which led to splitrock when he
caught sight of a rider cutting at a quar-
tering angle down the long slope which
was broken by the gulf of coyotero can-
yon having eagle-keen vision morgan
had no difficulty in identifying that fast-
moving rider it was vol holcombe fore-
man of the stirrup

  must have important news to be lash-
ing his horse like that muttered morgan
seems to be taking a short-cut to town
instead of following the road luke mc-
sherry led me over last night

  because his own mount needed a rest
morgan decided to pull up and wait for

holcombe he noted a second smudge
of dust indicating that the rider was
following the road which connected solit-
rock with the ranches in coyotero can-
yon it occurred to morgan that vol hol-
combe seemed bent on intercepting that
rider if he waited here morgan believed
that both riders would meet the road
fork only a short distance away from
where he had emerged from the desert

  and then holcombe caught sight of
wayne morgan his eye drawn to the mo-
tionless rider waiting up the snlitrock
road by the strike of ruddy sunlight on
morgans law badge abruptly holcombe
changed course heading his lathered
horse directly toward morgan

  holcombe riding up was flushed with
excitement the stirrup foreman drew
rein opposite morgans off stirrup and it
was several seconds before he could con-
trol his breathing enough to talk

  sheriff he gasped then i was just
headin to town to bring you some news
youve been waiting for

  then im glad i saved you about five
miles holcombe does it concern our
prisoner

  holcombe fanned his face with his
stetson brim

  yes-and no sheriff ive got two
prisoners in that cellar the new one is
joaquin musto

morgan jerked erect in saddle this
was startling news indeed it
meant his sheriffs mission was almost
finished

 how come

  holcombe slumped in saddle glad of a
chance to rest in halting sentences he
blurted out a sensational story

  not an hour after you and luke mc-
sherry left stirrup the dogs woke me up

turn page

	masked rider western

somebody was sneaking around the cel-
lar where we had scofield locked up i
went out to see what was up a man was
starting to saw the hasp oft the door he
was whispering to scofield i sneaked
up and pistol-whipped the son and then
i struck a match it was joaquin musto
morgan cuffed back his stetson and
scratched his head

  but how could musto have learned
that scofield was a prisoner at stirrup
no one knew but you and miss stella
holcombe shrugged how does musto
know everything that goes on in the
basin-from the secret gold shipments in
or out of the wells-fargo office to herds

of cattle ripe for the stealing musto
knows everything

  morgan swung his horse around

  he must have spies everywhere then
does miss stella know this

  holcombe shook his head i shoved
musto into the cellar and then headed for
town to tell you morgan

  a scowl formed a crease between mor-
gans brows

  did it take you all night to get this
far holcombe

  for a moment morgan thought he
detected something akin to alarm in
holcombes slitted eyes then the stir-
rup foreman grinned disarmingly

  i waited three-four hours to make sure
musto was alone sheriff our south
fence is on the mexican border you
know but it seems musto tried to turn
scofield loose on his own

  the muscles in wayne morgans face
contracted as he gathered up his reins

  wed better get back to the ranch
and pick up our prisoners pronto he
told holcombe that cellars no safe

prison any longer if musto knew sco-
field was there his owlhoot gang know
it too they might try a raid in broad
daylight if musto dont return

  the two riders headed back in the di-
rection of the stirrup ranch moving as
rapidly as holcombes exhausted horse
would permit the stirrup foreman kept
eyeing the coyotero canyon road but
there was no longer any trace of dust
from the fast-moving rider morgan had
believed to be heading toward town on
that route

  as they hit the foot of the long slope
which rose to the rocky heights over-
looking the coyotero cattle range a rider
suddenly leaped out from a clump of
tepula brush directly in their path

it was stella hemingway on an un-
saddled grulla bearing the stirrup
brand she was hatless and coatless and
in one slim bronzed fist she was carrying
a peacemaker revolver which seemed as
large as a cannon as she leveled it square
at her foremans chest

  stellas sudden appearance took mor-
gan by surprise as much as it did hol-
combe

  the foreman rocked back in his saddle
one hand poised in the act of streaking
toward his holstered 

  get your hands up vol or ill shoot
to kill panted the cowgirl urging the
grulla closer you know how well i can
shoot you ought to you taught me

  morgan could only stare in astonish-
ment at this scene wasnt this girl the
fiancee of vol holcombe

  what is this maam morgan asked

  whatever shes got to say dont be-
lieve her sheriff rapped out holcombe
his voice unsteady with terror as he stared
at the eared-back hammer of stellas six-
gun a whit more pressure of her trigger
finger would blast a slug clean through
his body

  sheriff morgan cried the daughter of
the victim of yesterdays killing i want
you to arrest this-this rattlesnake fore-
man of mine take his guns away from
him

the quarry

kdtv aayne morgan stared at
yy vol holcombe the man was
kh gaa a frozen in a posture of stark
t horror his face beaded with
jwl sflp glinting droplets of moisture
wxwfi  why should i arrest
oj  him morgan asked the
grim excited girl are you
forgetting you are engaged to marry this
man

stellas laugh was not pleasant to hear

  thank heaven i found him out for the
sidewinder he is sheriff last night i
couldnt sleep finally-well i guess i
went a little crazy thinking about dads
killing i got his gun and went out to the
cellar-i admit it-with the idea of kill-
ing lane scofield i figured he was back
of dads death

  shes lyin sheriff fumed vol hol-
combe

  go on miss hemingway morgan
prompted realizing that her iron control
might easily give away to hysteria

  i saw joaquin musto and vol here un-
lock the root cellar and turn scofield
loose stella gasped i should have shot
them as they stood there making their
plans to-

  morgan saw holcombe break his
stunned paralysis saw sunlight flash on
gunmetal as the foreman made his draw
the gun in stellas hand thundered but
her hand was suddenly shaking and the
bullet did no more than pluck a puff of
alkali dust from holcombes sombrero

  with incredible swiftness wayne mor-
gan jerked a colt from leather and drove
a slug into the cylinder of holcombes
gun tearing it from the foremans grasp
a shaved instant before the man could
send a bullet into the girls head

  i guess tve heard enough lo realize
that holcombe was drawing me into a
trap at the stirrup maam morgan said
grimly since scofield is no longer our
prisoner theres no use riding back to
your ranch well take holcombe into

town-under arrest for attempted killing
and for being a spy of the musto bandido
bunch

  vol holcombe was staring down at the
blood streaming from his fingers lacer-
ated by the trigger guard of the six-gun
which morgans bullet had sent kiting in-
to the chaparral a smudge of raw gun-
smoke hung milkily in the still morning
air forming an umbrella over the three
riders

  riding closer to holcombe morgan
reached out to remove the foremans re-
serve six-gun from its holster as he
moved a steely voice lashed out of no-
where to arrest morgan in the awkward
posture of half-standing in his stirrups

   hold it sheriff ive got a bead on that
tin badge of yours make a booger move
and the girl dies pronto

  morgan jerked his head around riding
out of the tepula thicket directly behind
the stunned stella hemingway came the
burly black-bearded slash s renegade
lane scofield

  at scofields stirrup was a gaudily-
dressed half-breed whom morgan knew
instantly must be the border outlaw king
joaquin musto both riders held six-guns
trained on morgan and stella heming-
way

  vol holcombe reached out with his un-
injured left hand and jerked the colt 
from morgans hand

  sheriff the stirrup foreman jeered
with heavy sarcasm it looks like youve
made your last arrest this side of hades
you and stella are goin to die together

  stella hemingway sat her barebacked
pony as if frozen as she saw her erstwhile
fiance draw a steady bead on wayne mor-
gans chest she knew that musto and
scofield had their guns trained on her
back but life to her had suddenly become
a thing to be cheaply regarded the kill-
ing of her father and the disillusioning
discovery she had made concerning vol
holcombes duplicity had deprived her of
any desire to live

     he still held her fathers six-gun in
     her hand a tendril of smoke wisping
	masked rider western

from its bore she cocked her wrist up-
wards one thumb rocking the knurled
hammer back to full cock

  the ominous double click of the colts
trigger mechanism caught holcombes ear
and he jerked his head around to face
the up-coming muzzle of stellas weapon
in that instant when holcombes attention
was divided wayne morgan jabbed
spurs to his mounts flanks and sent the
big animal crashing against holcombes
mount

  stella held her fire as she saw wayne
morgan vault from saddle his dive carry-
ing holcombe out of stirrups to crash into
a spiny thicket of yerba cactus landing
astraddle the doublecrossing stirrup
foreman morgans right boot heel drove
holcombes six-gun barrel into the dirt

  behind stella lane scofield exploded
into action the slash s boss was still
handcuffed so that he held his guns in a
clumsy fashion he used them as a club
striking the girls elbow such a numbing
blow that she lost her grip on her six-gun

  joaquin musto leaped out of saddle and
skirted the two riderless horses through
the dust kicked up by their churning
hoofs he saw wayne morgan drive a
rock-hard fist into vol holcombes jaw
wilting the man

  stella screamed in pain and terror as
she saw morgan come to his feet clawing
his reserve six-gun from holster-a draw
which the swift sequence of events lead-
ing to the unhorsing of holcombe had
prevented before now

  morgan look out behind

  he heard the scream of warning and
half-crouched whirled to meet the men-
ace of joaquin mustos attack from the
rear he had a pinched-off glimpse of the
big outlaws gun whizzing toward him
and he thumbed a quick shot through the
moiling dust at exactly the same instant
that the hurtling colt smashed him on the
forehead

  fireworks exploded inside wayne mor-
gans skull he felt his senses teeter into
a spinning vortex of oblivion the gun in
his hand was suddenly a weight too heavy
to lift his knees turned rubbery and he

sprawled face downward into the cactus
nettles his husky form crisscrossing the
dazed vol holcombe

  musto drove a brutal kick to morgans
ribs then stooped to recover his six-gun
with a quick lunge he seized the trailing
reins of the horses belonging to morgan
and holcombe to prevent their bolting

  in the background musto had a hazy
view of stella sliding off her horse to land
on hands and knees in the sand lane
scofield dismounted and came forward to
stand over her with ready guns

  musto panting heavily walked over to
his horse and unhooked a canteen from
the pommel he unscrewed the cap and
let the brackish water dribble down on
vol holcombes dust-grimed cheeks hoi- 
combe almost knocked out by morgans
single blow shook his head dazedly and
finding himself pinned down by the sher-
iffs bulk wriggled out from under and
came shakily to his feet

  youre plumb lucky musto and i
decided to follow you over the ridge
vol commented lane scofield we
knew we might be needed when we saw
this morgan jasper waitin for you and
stella to meet at the forks

  holcombe recovered his six-gun re-
moved the cylinder and blew out the dirt
which stoppered the colt barrel

  what are we waitin for he snarled
it goes without sayin stellas got to die
she knows too much and this fancy-
dandy sheriff whos wearin jennings tin
badge-

   hold your trigger vol scofield called
out sharply killin a woman is one
thing gettin rid of her body is another
we aint got the time nor the tools to
dig a hole deep enough to bury her and
morgan in

holcombe jabbed his six-gun into
holster and glowered in stellas di-
rection she lay on the ground panting
like a landed fish scofield had kicked her
six-gun far to one side

  si agreed musto graves are not
good in this desert soil somebody might
find where a coyote had dug into it and
the outlaw sheriff

if anyone found this senoritas body bur-
ied here it would leave you with ques-
tions to answer senor holcombe that we
cannot risk

  scofield winced with pain for his
tightly-notched handcuffs were beginning
to constrict the swollen flesh of his wrists

  i got a plan thatll save us a lot of
work and will take care of these two
the slash s boss said lets take em
over to the old sandstone quarry and
dump em over the rimrock the fifty-
foot fall will smash em to hashmeat on
the bottom of the quarry and nobodyd
ever spot their bones down there

 vol holcombe nodded agreement
even if somebody seen buzzards floatin
over the quarry and rode to investigate
said theyd figger that a couple riders
lost their way after dark and rode their
broncs over the edge

  stella got to her feet lashing holcombe
with a scornful gaze

  how low can a man get she whis-
pered hoarsely and to think that dad
had his heart set on me marrying a beast
like you volmer holcombe

  holcombe averted his eyes touched by
a vague remorse at the turn events had
taken stella was the most desirable girl
in this section of the country to have
had her as his wife would have been fine
but that was impossible now

  im ridin on back to the stirrup he
said abruptly the boysll be finishin
breakfast and wonderin where i am im
goin to tell em i took stella to town for
her dads funeral and that she wont be
back ill tell the crew she decided to go
visit her aunt in california

  neither musto nor scofield voiced any
objections as vol holcombe caught up his
reins and swung into saddle

  im sending the crew to town to the
funeral he said so you two wont have
to worry about bein spotted crossin the
stirrup on your way to the hideout at
mescalero arroyo holcombes eyes
settled briefly on stella

  so long honey he said then rowel-
ing his horse savagely he headed off up
the slope at a dead run



  musto unbuckled a coil of lass-rope
from his pommel and flipped a noose ex-
pertly about stella hemingways shoul-
ders pinioning her arms to her sides she
offered no resistance as the big half-breed
hoisted her astride her stirrup pony

  wayne morgan was still unconscious
when musto loaded him aboard the ham-
merhead roan and tied him to horn and
stirrups that done the two outlaws
mounted and leading a prisoner apiece
set off across the sage-spiced dunes to-
ward the southern foothills

  the sandstone quarry which was their
destination was the deep pothole where a
contractors syndicate from phoenix had
quarried pink sandstone slabs years be-
fore shipping the building blocks all over
the country to satisfy the fad for using
arizona flagstones the quarry had been
abandoned for nearly ten years

  well off the beaten track of basin
riders the quarry was an ideal place to
dispose of the evidence of a double killing
it was doubtful whether the fate of wayne
morgan and stella hemingway would
ever be learned once they were hurled
into the quarrys pit

  as they rode musto and scofield dis-
cussed their plans for visiting the slash s
and picking up the contraband stored
there they agreed it would be prudent
to wait until nightfall to head for mexico
and the safety of their hideaway

chapter ix

rattlesnake peril

oaquin musto and sco-
field reined up at the edge of
the fifty-foot-deep quarry

with its rim forming a rough

ova thousands of tons of
fine pink building stone had
been carved out of this hole
ancj freighted to the nearest
railroad siding all traces of
the crews quarters had long since disap-
peared brush had grown up to conceal
the rusty hulk of the steam engine which
had been used for hoisting stone blocks
w	masked rider western

out of the quarry

  the bottom of the quarry pit was now
covered with water where the miners had
tapped a subterranean stream since
pumping was too costly the quarry had
been abandoned as a commercial enter-
prise

  if morgan and the girl dont die from
the fall theyll drown in that lake com-
mented scofield swinging out of stirrups
and walking over to pull stella from her
horse stella believe me when i say im
sorry weve got to do this to a spunky
gal like you but- 

  stella jerked herself free of scofields
manacled hands with a wild cry of de-
spair she raced to the rim of the quarry
and hurled herself into space

  musto and scofield leaped to the rim-
rock in time to see the girls hurtling
body strike the surface of the shallow
lake fifty feet below with a geysering
splash they crouched there for several
minutes without seeing her come to the
surface

  im glad she did that muttered sco-
field i wouldnt have slept so well for
a long time to come knowing id pushed a
girl as purty as stel was into that hole

  joaquin musto untied the lariat which
bound morgan to his gray and let the out-
law sheriffs inert body spill to the ground
morgans eyes were half-open and he was
fast rallying back to his senses but he
was still incapable of understanding what
was going on

  better chuck him over and be done
with it musto scofield advised leave
the sheriffs star on him makes me feel a
lot better knowin morgans took care of
i wonder where that salty hombre come
from anyhow

  musto grabbed morgan by the ankles
and dragged him over to the overhanging
lip of the quarrys sandstone cliff a
groan escaped morgans lips as musto put
a spike-heeled cowboot against his shoul-
der and shoved

  as limp as a bundle of rags wayne
morgan toppled over the sandstone cliff
crest and plummeted toward the gun-
metal-gray surface of the lake below

consciousness left him just before he
struck the water and sank in the stagnant
green depths

  side by side on the rimrock musto and
scofield peered down at the widening
ripples which made little wavelets on the
far side of the quarry but the overhang
of the cliff prevented them from seeing
whether or not the sheriffs body surfaced
again

  at a sudden drumming of hoofbeats
the two outlaws whirled about but it
was not riders approaching wayne mor-
gans hammerhead roan and the girls
pony finding themselves free were gal-
loping off into the juniper timber which
grew about the rim of the abandoned
quarry

  let em go grunted scofield jump-
ing to catch his own mounts reins we
better be rattlin our hocks over to my
spread musto you cant risk bein
spotted north of the border in daylight
i told you before

  musto laughed with grim humor

  after the braggin you done in front of
judge mcsherry he reminded the slash
s boss you are not free to remain in
gringo territory either amigo   

when stella hemingway made her
leap into the quarrys abyss it had
been with the conviction that death would
await her on the rocky bottom but
striking the water which she had forgot-
ten was there she found her dive cush-
ioned by the cold depths

  some instinct - perhaps the primitive
sense of self-preservation which bums in
the soul of all living creatures-prompted
the girl to hold her breath and start swim-
ming under the lakes surface she came
to the top in a roil of spume to find herself
under the overhanging quarry wall out of
sight of the two outlaws

  even as she dragged herself up on the
broken talus which formed a narrow
weed-mottled ledge between the water
and the base of the cliff stella caught sight
of musto and scofield peering over the
rimrock their heads mirrored in the green
ripples of the quarry lake as they peered
the outlaw sheriff	

down waiting for her body to surface

  panic coursed through the girl as she
stared around at the sheer fifty-foot walls
hemming her in drowning would have
been infinitely preferable to the slow death
by starvation which faced her now why
had she saved herself when doom was
absolutely certain

  the icy water had revived her senses
she lay gasping on the rocks her legs still
submerged when she saw wayne morgan
hurtle from the top of the quarry and van-
ish below the surface of the lake

  morgan did not have her chance for sur-
vival for he was probably unconscious

  the merciful thing to do would be to
let the man drown she thought we
could never get out of here anyway

  but some instinct again went to work
the instinct to save another human life
stella clambered to her feet and dived into
the gelid depths of the lake all her life
she had been an expert swimmer she had
been able to swim in coyotero creek
almost as soon as she could toddle by the
time she had been midway through her
teens she could handle herself in the
water like a trout and that ability rare
for an arizona girl served her in good
stead now

  opening her eyes she found that the
water was crystal clear ahead of her she
saw a chain of bubbles tugging toward
the surface another dozen strokes and
she found the source of those bubbles

  wayne morgans body was rolling slug-
gishly on the rock bottom directly ahead
of her the weight of his bullhide chaps
and justin boots and loaded shell belts had
offset the natural buoyancy of his hun-
dred-and-eighty-pound body without im-
mediate aid wayne morgan was doomed
to drown

  the next moment she had a firm grip on
morgans shirt the ball points of jennings
sheriff badge cutting the flesh of her palm

  towing a heavy weight was a simple
thing under water her lungs were burst-
ing for oxygen but she struggled back
toward the near bank under the cliffs
overhang where her rescue of wayne
morgan would go unnoticed from the rim

  with superhuman effort the girl
plunged her way ashore dragging mor-
gans head above the surface she rested
there a moment not sure whether she had
recovered a dead man from the depths or
not so inert was the sheriff

  out of water the full burden of mor-
gans weight became apparent it took the
last ounce of the girls flagging strength to
haul him out to where his torso was clear
of the water

a gasp of relief broke from stellas
lips as she heard morgan begin a
series of coughs the paroxysms wracking
his body as nature took over and caused
him to expel the water from his bronchial
tubes

  by slow degrees consciousness came
back to him he opened his eyes and stared
around with a glassy off-focus intensity

  gradually stella hemingways lithe-
some shape took on a semblance of reality
his water-plugged ears caught her first
words

  try and crawl up on these rocks
youre safe-at least from drowning im
not so sure youll thank me for pulling you
out when you realize the predicament
were in

  morgan dragged his legs out of the water
and scrambled up on the talus ledge be-
side the girl even with her blond hair
hanging in plastered ducktails about her
head the youthful curves of her supple
body plainly outlined by her wet clothing
stella hemingway had a natural beauty
which put a pound in any mans blood

  after a final round of coughing morgan
asked weakly

  where are we stella

  in the old sandstone quarry at the foot
of lizard hill musto and scofield pitched
us in here to destroy the evidence of their
latest kills sheriff

  shielding his eyes against the flash of
sunlight on the placid surface of the lake
morgan scanned the sheer pink walls of
the sandstone quarry at no point was
there a ledge or a fissure where they could
hope to climb out of this abyss scaling
the beetling scarp surfaces would be im-
masked rider western



possible even for a lizard the quarrymen
had undercut the cliffs

  at least-at least we wont die of thirst
here morgan said essaying a feeble grin
any chance of riders spotting us down
here

  meeting his gaze with frank candor
stella shook her head

  not a chance this quarry is off the
beaten path by ten miles it hasnt been
worked in a generation we might as well
resign ourselves to dying here

  a sudden bzzzzz from the rocks caused
morgan to leap to his feet staring aghast
at the scaly coils of a diamond-back rattle-
snake which had slithered out of the talus
within inches of where the girl was sitting
knees drawn up to her chin letting the hot
sunshine draw the steam from her cloth-
ing

  stooping morgan picked up a jagged
chunk of sandstone and hurled it at the
reptile crushing its deadly coffin-shaped
head an instant later he saw three other
rattlers crawl back into the rocks from a
ledge where they had been sunning their
ugly bodies

  the quarry teems with snakes stella
said shuddering uncontrollably i re-
member daddy telling me about that how
they got here i dont know but whole
nests of them were uncovered by the blast-
ing crews when this quarry was in opera-
tion

  morgan pulled her to her feet

  theres a sandy stretch down by the
water lets get down there loose rock
is where snakes like to lurk if ive got to
die i dont want it to be from a rattlers
fangs

  stella drew back we cant venture out
from under here until were positive
musto and scofield have left she de
murred

  morgan nodded glancing about appre-
hensively as he heard another rattlesnake
sound its lethal warning somewhere un-
derfoot during the next five minutes he
had killed four of the loathsome reptiles
without moving his feet

  what became of holcombe wayne
asked

  he left for the ranch going to tell my
crew that i-that im in town for dads
funeral she started to weep as morgan
drew her head against his wet shoulder
just think i wont even get to see him
laid to rest

  morgan could think of nothing to say
he knew they could not dwell upon the
hopelessness of their situation escape
from the quarry was an impossibility
death by snakebite or starvation seemed
to be the only alternatives facing them
yet to think about these things was dan-
gerous it could crack their sanity

         chapter x
         indian code

e c a u s e the rocky ledge
seemed to contain more rat-
tlesnakes than they could
cope with morgan picked
stella hemingway up in his
arms and skirted the rim of
the lake to where a narrow
shelf of sand and decomposed
rock gave them a better place
to wait out their doom but from this spot
they would be in plain sight of hostile
eyes from the rim overhead

  glancing up his eyes squinting against
the enamel-blue arizona sky morgan
caught sight of his hammerhead roan
looking down at them

  if only that roan could be sent for
help if only he would go back to blue
hawks camp instead of keeping vigil
over us here- he said musingly as if to
himself

  stella hemingway glanced up sharply

  blue hawks camp she echoed
isnt blue hawk that indian partner of
the masked riders

  morgan bit his lip it seemed illogical
to keep his secret from this girl in view
of the fact that they would share the last
days of their life together in this hell-
hole but by force of long habit morgan
evaded her question

  maybe you know the masked rider is
in this section of the country miss
the outlaw sheriff	

stella he said well i might as well
confess-i am a friend of the masked
rider i happen to know that he and
his indian companero are camped over in
the foothills not quite five miles from
here

  new hope seemed to well up in the
girls eyes

  if-do you think they might-

 he shook his head guessing her
thought

  no chance of them finding us stella
theyre lying low if they havent headed
for the safety of mexico by now dont
build up any false hopes of the masked
rider saving us

looking around morgan noticed
that quantities of brush most of it
tinder-dry greasewood and tornillo cov-
ered a portion of the talus on the north
perimeter of the quarry where the suns
rays reached it at all seasons

  sight of that brush set him to probing
his pocekts

  he was rewarded by finding his water-
proof match box containing a dozen
lucifers dipped in paraffine

  at least youll have a fire tonight to
keep the rattlers away from you mor-
gan said doing what he could to bolster
the girls flagging spirits its too bad the
quarry is so deep no one would see it if
i lighted a signal fire

  she plucked the sopping fabric of her
shirt off her shoulders grateful at least
for the warm beat of the suns rays

  i wish wed both died in that fall she
said dispiritedly there is worse than
no hope for us here  know that im
resigned to it you-you dont have to
encourage me

  morgan grinned his admiration tor this
girl she became an added incentive for
him to fathom some way of escape he
had been in desperate situations before
and had used his own keen imagination
and physical strength to save himself
but never before had he been confronted
with a situation which was as hopeless as
this   

sheriff jeff jennings

boredom was an acid eating into
blue hawk with nothing more
important to do than keep a sharp look-
out for posses which might be currying
the seco madura badlands in search of
the masked riders camp the yaqui
found his traditional indian patience
strained to the breaking point he would
have infinitely preferred acute danger to
this useless idleness

 leaving the rincon where midnight
and the other two horses were enjoying
a well-earned rest after their posse-
hounded flight across arizona territory
blue hawk made his way to the peak of
the ridge and squatted on his haunches
to size up the far-flung expanse of split-
rock basin

  no detail of this heat-shimmering vista
of desert grandeur escaped the yaquis
coal-black restless eyes he saw a wells
fargo stage creeping across the basin
floor like a bug dragging a white stream-
er of dust for miles behind it he saw the
glint of sunshine on the windows of split-
rocks buildings ten miles by crow-flight
across the desert wastes

  far beyond he could see cattle grazing
on the bottomlands where the coyotero
river wound its way toward mexico and
its mouth in the gulf of california he
	masked rider western

watched a buzzard circling in the high-
vaulted blue dome of the heavens

  somewhere down there wayne morgan
was engaged in a one-man crusade to free
this cattle country of the menace of a
mexican border gang it filled blue hawk
with an almost physical ache not to be
doing his share to accomplish the downfall
of the notorious border legion led by
joaquin musto

  but being an indian blue hawks face
showed no sign of the ennui which was
gnawing at him like a malignant disease
patience was a birthright of a yaqui sub-
chieftain

  wayne morgan before leaving the
camp at daybreak this morning had told
him to lie low here and await his return
and he would wait

  only in the event of acute danger to
himself was blue hawk to break camp and
head for mexico and the prearranged ren-
dezvous in the calliente mountains where
morgan had arranged to meet him in case
an emergency drove his indian partner out
of arizona

  suddenly something happened to snap
blue hawk out of his lethargy something
which set his pulses galloping a puff of
smoke was lifting through the heated
arizona atmosphere vividly white against
the mottled greenery of the palos verdes
and mesquites which clothed the lower
reaches of this foothill on whose crest he
had stationed himself

  fascinated blue hawk watched that
puffball of smoke ride the heated air-
waves pulsing off the desert floor finally
thinning into nothingness hundreds of feet
above the earth where the lone buzzard
was soaring on motionless pinions

  as blue hawk stared he saw a second
puff of smoke lift from the earth itself-
from an oval depression in the ground
which appeared from this distance to be
some deep crater between the foothill
spurs watching that white dot head for
the zenith blue hawk saw it followed by
another puff of smoke and still another
like three balloons tied together at exact
intervals the smoke-puffs floated lazily
upward to finally dissolve in the wind

currents of the upper air

  three puffs of smoke so cleanly formed
and spaced could not have resulted hap-
hazardly from some cowpunchers brand-
ing iron fire if that was a smoke signal
it was carrying a message of distress in
a code as old as the prehistoric indian
tribes whose blood ran in blue hawks
veins

  as he watched every fiber in his cop-
pery frame alert as a hound on point blue
hawk saw the smoke signal repeated it
came from the depths of the crater which
the indian had spotted earlier today dur-
ing a vigil from this ridge crest

  there was no mistaking it someone
somebody was in danger down in that
craterlike depression and was sending up
smoke signals in the hope of attracting
someones attention to his plight no de-
cent man could ignore this sos of the
plains

the yaqui came to his feet and with
pantherlike stealth headed down the
south side of the ridge to his rincon camp
he paused to make sure that the saddle-
bags which contained the masked riders
regalia were safely hidden from the eyes
of any casual rider

  by force of long habit blue hawk had
erased the evidences of the campfire he
and wayne morgan had built when they
first reached this spot to boil the last of
their coffee

  then pulling his grays picket pin blue
hawk saddled up put a winchester in the
boot and mounted

  when he topped the ridge he was in
time to see another set of distress signals
fading out against the shimmering blue
sky directly over the huge pot-hole at the
foot of the ridge five miles away steering
a bee-line toward that crater blue hawk
put the gray into a hard gallop trusting to
the pony to keep its footing on this flinty
declivity

  less than an hour later the yaqui
reined up in a motte of smoke trees fifty
yards from the south rim of the crater he
could tell now that the hole was man-
made by the terraced regularity of the
the outlaw sheriff

cuttings on the sandstone walls this at
some time in the past had been a masonry
quarry

  even as he slid from stirrups and lever-
ing a shell into his rifle breech started
toward the rim of the quarry blue hawk
caught sight of two horses standing in
motionless vigil on the opposite rim of the
chasm

  one was wayne morgans roan the
other was a pony bearing a stirrup brand
which blue hawk had never seen before

  breaking into a run blue hawk skidded
to a halt on the verge of the sheer drop-off
dreading what he might see

  a glad shout greeted the indians ap-
pearance against the skyline across a
shimmering platter of water pooled in the
pit of the quarry blue hawk saw two
figures waving at him from a narrow spit
of reddish sand

  wayne morgan and a blonde girl

  blue hawk lifted a hand to acknowledge
that he had seen the pair how they had
reached the bottom of this fifty-foot crater
the yaqui could not fathom beside them
was a smoldering fire of uprooted weeds
and the fact that wayne morgan was
standing there shirtless the sun gleaming
on the bronzed musculature of his chest
showed blue hawk that morgan had used
that shirt to gather smoke from his signal
fire and release it in puff form into the
heavens

  turning blue hawk vanished from the
skyline mounting his horse he circled
the rim of the quarry until he was directly
over the spot where his partner and the
girl were standing

  on the ground near the cliff brink was
a discarded lariat blue hawk picked it
up estimated its length with a practised
eye and made one end fast to the horn of
morgans saddle

  then stepping to the edge of the rim-
rock he shook the coiled reala loose and
tossed it over the side directly below him
morgan and the girl were picking their
way over the talus toward the spot where
the ropes noose dangled

  all right-pull away slow and easy
came morgans voice from the echoing



  depths of the quarry im sending the
senorita up first hawk

  si senor the indian called back and
turned to pick up the roans reins

  five minutes later blue hawk was
stooping to grip stella hemingway by the
armpits and haul her to safety she was
on the verge of tears as she stumbled away
from the cliff brink and leaned against a
juniper tree

  thank god-you saw-signals blue
hawk she was repeating over and over
it was such a slim chance

chapter xi

holcombes rise to power

emoving the lariat noose
from the girls body the
yaqui lowered the rope once
more into the abyss in a mat-
ter of minutes the horse had
lifted wayne morgan to the
top of the cliff blue hawk
watched the rope carefully to
make sure the abrasion of the sandstone
did not sever the rawhide pleating and
drop his partner to certain death on the
rocks below

  no words passed between the two part-
ners of the danger trails as they shook
hands blue hawks alert eye had saved
his partner from a gruesome death and
the girl as well there could never be any
adequate repayment for that

  the masked rider-is he with you
wayne morgan asked for stellas benefit
as she came over to join them

  blue hawk shook his head

  he waits at our camp senor

  morgan turned to stella hemingway
you wont miss your fathers funeral
after all maam morgan said huskily
ill take you to splitrock you can under-
stand why our friend blue hawk cannot
go with us

  she smiled through her tears impul-
sively she reached up to pull the yaquis
head down to hers and kissed him warmly
on a copper-hued cheek

of course she said huskily i will
	masked rider western

never forget what you did for us today
blue hawk if-if you and the masked
rider ever need help i want you to know
that my stirrup ranch will always offer
you sanctuary

  blue hawk confused by the girls dis-
play of emotion turned away and began
coiling up the lariat

  hawk wayne morgan said as he
watched stella go over to where her pony
stood i want you to go back to camp and
bring midnight and the masked rider
here weve got a job to do over at the
slash s ranch joaquin musto and lane
scofield the hombres who threw this girl
and me into the quarry this morning are
holing up at the slash s waiting for dark-
ness so they can cross the border

  blue hawk nodded his black eyes flash-
ing at last he was going to be dealt cards
in this showdown

  si senor i-we will be waiting the
indian smiled the two hombres you
speak of will not live to reach mexico
wayne morgan winked and headed over
to his waiting roan stella had already
mounted	

  you can stay with judge mcsherrys
family in town miss hemingway wayne
morgan was saying as blue hawk rode
away i wont have time to talk with the
judge or luke but you can tell them that
im paying a visit to coyotero canyon on
sheriffs business tell the judge i aim to
return to splitrock before sundown with
three prisoners scofield musto-

  and vol holcombe stella finished for
him ill tell the judge to be expecting
you and i hope the masked rider will
be with you wayne ive heard judge
mcsherry speak kindly of him many
times  

  the first thing vol holcombe did upon
arriving at the stirrup ranch was to give
the entire crew the day off so that they
could attend their boss funeral in split-
rock when the last riders had saddled
up and headed toward town on their sad
mission holcombe headed north toward
lane scofields place

  by now the girl he had planned to marry
-for the purpose of gaining control of

stirrup rather than for love-was buzzard
bait at the bottom of the old sandstone
quarry whose product had given splitrock
its name with her would be the corpse of
wayne morgan the stranger who had
been loco enough to pin on jeff jennings
star and carry on as the basins sheriff

  these deaths rested lightly on hol-
combes conscience an opportunist he
was now reveling in his own rise to power
morgan had undoubtedly spread the word
that lane scofield was a secret member of
mustos outlaw band therefore scofield
would have to leave the slash s and seek
refuge in mexico

this would make holcombe the most
important contact musto would have
in arizona the stirrup would become an
avenue for smuggling and rustling a loop-
hole in the international boundary with
stella and morgan dead no one in the
territory could point an accusing hand at
vol holcombe and say the stirrups
foreman is as much a crook as scofield
reaching the slash ss adobe ranch-
house holcombe found the grounds de-
serted at least to outward appearances
the slash s crew was busy on the north-
ern part of the range mending fences and
cutting wild hay for winter but holcombe
knew that musto and scofield had had
time to get back to this hideout

  dismounting in the shade of the pepper
trees in front of the slash s ranch-
house holcombe made his way to the front
door and entered without knocking

  he walked over to a table in front of
scofields big rock fireplace and brushing
aside the empty liquor bottles greasy
decks of cards and a litter of poker chips
holcombe removed a fat legal-sized en-
velope from his pocket and drew up a
rawhide-bottomed chair

  come on out you hombres he called
i got business to talk over

  a bedroom door creaked open and lane
scofield emerged bleary-eyed from loss
of sleep behind him came joaquin musto
his mexican garb seeming oddly out of
place in this room

  you took care of stella and that mor-
the outlaw sheriff	

gan ranny holcombe inquired opening
his envelope and drawing out a legal-
looking document

  scofield nodded moodily his breath
held a stale odor of whisky the handcuffs
no longer fettered his wrists

  chucked em into the quarry they
both drowned

  joaquin musto seated himself on the
opposite side of the table and scowled
down at the paper holcombe had smoothed
out before them

  whats this the outlaw chief asked
in spanish

  vol holcombe took a cheroot from his
vest pocket and lighted it up through
purling blue smoke he stared up at lane
scofield a secret triumph lurked in his
green eyes

  a deed to the stirrup ranch which is
now my property-or will be as soon as
i can get to town and record it

  scofields brows jerked up your prop-
erty holcombe dont tell me old josh
left the spread to his ramrod instead of
his daughter

  holcombe shook his head i forged her
signature to the deed transferrin the
stirrup over to me lock stock and barl
ill tell the recorder down at the court-
house that seein as how stella and me
aim to get married anyway she decided
to deed the place over to me in advance
 scofield grunted reckon mort cool-
idge will swaller that but hell begin to
wonder why your weddin dont take place
a few weeks from now

  no holcombe said ill let the word
get out that stella left for california to
visit relatives leavin me to run the
ranch

  joaquin musto grinned as his agile
brain caught on to what lay back of hol-
combes scheme

  this is muy bueno the half-breed said
for ten years we have needed stirrup to
use in smuggling contraband across the
border

  holcombe nodded keeping his gaze set
on scofield

  and you my friend lane-the stir-
rup foreman grinned-are going to sign

over the slash s to me so that the stirrup
can become one ranoh with yours and
control the entire length of coyotero
canyon

  scofield bristled angrily up until to-
day he had been joaquin mustos most
important lieutenant north of the border
now in view of what wayne morgan had
accomplished in the past twenty-four
hours scofield was on the dodge and
vol holcombe had taken over his role as
mustos right-hand man

  it must be as senor vol says amigo
musto said sensing the reason for sco-
fields anger better for holcombe to
own slash s than for some stranger to
buy it at public auction after you dis-
appear into mejico no es verdad

scofield stared at the floor galled
by the fact that he was thrust into a
situation which put him in holcombes
power there was no disputing the logic
of his argument and now that musto had
swung his weight to holcombes side
there was little he could do

  esta bueno the slash s boss yielded
grudgingly were all in this together i
reckon just so long as holcombe dont
get the idea he throws a big shadder over
our future deals musto

  one of the traits that had made musto
the leader he was over an aggregation of
tough and ruthless men was his ability
to keep jealousy at a minimum among his
cohorts he foresaw trouble between
these two gringos unless a whip hand was
held over both

  in our banda we share and share
alike he said senor holcombe will not
profit more than you by this business
amigo i will see to that

  flinging a bitter glance at holcombe
the slash s boss crossed the room to
where his safe stood in a corner opened
the vault and fishing around in a dossier
of private papers produced a quit-claim
deed form

  he filled in the deed turning over the
title to the slash s to volmer holcombe
and signed it conscious of the fact that
he was signing over the sum total of his
masked rider western



work and strivings of the past twenty
years

  its the only way out for us lane
holcombe chuckled pocketing the deed
along with the forged title to the stirrup
after all im the only man in on this
deal who is above suspicion here in the
territory stella and that morsan iasper
were the only ones who knew i wear
mustos collar and theyre out of the
way

  dont rub it in scofield snarled
waspishly

  the recorder over in splitrock wont
see anything fishy about me suddenly be-
comin a ranch owner holcombe per-
sisted ill tell him you decided to leave
arizona for your health-and that i paid
you my life savings for the slash s

  holcombe got to his feet donned his
stetson and headed for the front door al-
ready walking with the possessive swag-
ger of a monarch who ruled this house
and this range

  soon as it gets dark musto called
after him senor scofield and i will head
south of the border you will know where
to find us amigo

  holcombe was whistling a merry range
tune as he spurred away from the slash
s headed for town yesterday he had
been a fifty-a-month foreman on hem-
ingways spread today as soon as he
attended to the routine business of re-
cording his spurious deeds he would be
the leading rancher of splitrock basin
in addition to that he would share in the
fabulous profits of mustos smuggling op-
erations it was an overwhelming pros-
pect

  play your cards right holcombe told
himself and you might get musto out of
the way and boss that gang of contra-
bandistas yourself youre a lucky cuss

         the masked rider

         he sun was westering to-
ward the seco madura peaks
when wayne morgan returned
to the old sandstone quarry
following his trip to splitrock

  he left stella hemingway
at judge mcsherrys home
the courthouse flag had been
at half-mast in honor of the
girls father most of the town had been
gathered at the methodist church where
a skypilot had been waiting to preach old
joshua hemingways funeral sermon

  sterner things than honoring the dead
occupied morgans attention now from
what stella had overheard of scofields
plans during their trek to the sandstone
quarry this morning morgan knew that
the slash s rancher and joaquin musto
planned to wait for nightfall at scofields
ranch before heading south to mustos
hideout below the border

  with events shaping up as they were
wayne morgan believed that his mission
in splitrock basin would be concluded be-
fore another sunrise but from here on
the masked rider would step into the
picture to replace the supposedly drowned
morgan

  arriving at the quarry for the second
time today morgan found his faithful ally
blue hawk waiting for him with mid-
night the magnificent stallion which might
have been sculped out of ebony the
horse nickered its welcome as morgan
dismounted unsaddled the roan and
picketed it out in the chaparral

  unbuckling the big alforja bags on mid-
nights silver-mounted saddle morgan
took out a black domino mask black
sombrero and sable-hued riding cloak to-
gether with a pair of black leather shell
belts fitted with black holsters and a brace
of ebony-stocked colt  six-shooters

  into the saddle-bags went the gray
stetson and gun harness-minus their
s which were still in mustos posses-
sion presumably-which he used while
the outlaw sheriff	

enacting the role of wayne morgan

  when he had donned his black regalia
morgan the roving cowboy had ceased to
exist

  in his place stood the dramatic mystery
horseman of the west the robin hood
outlaw whose feats of daring were al-
ready a legend of the frontier cattle land
even his voice was changed to fit his alter
ego role-a rich bass instead of wayne
morgans vibrant baritone

  we ride first to the stirrup rancho
hawk the masked rider explained
swinging astride midnight and picking up
his reins the stirrup crew has gone to
town for senor hemingways funeral
but we will find senor vol holcombe
there according to what stella overheard
this morning

  si senor responded blue hawk

  we will wait at the stirrup the
masked rider went on until nightfall
according to senorita stella musto and
scofield will hide out on the slash s until
dark then head for mexico we will way-
lay them as they pass the hemingway
ranch

  blue hawk galloping at the masked
riders stirrup filled his lungs with a
wild exhilaration he knew that a gun-
smoke showdown awaited them but that
a showdown with musto and scofield
would not be easily accomplished in spite
df the masked riders nonchalant way of
outlining what lay ahead

  this was where blue hawk belonged-
at the masked riders side sharing what-
ever risks lay ahead tonight after the
enforced boredom of the past two days
the impending showdown with the bor-
ders most desperate gunman was wel-
come indeed

  sunset was not far off when the masked
rider and blue hawk dipped over the di-
vide separating the canyon of the coyotero
from the basin the stirrup bunkhouse
was dark as the masked rider had antic-
ipated it would be the ranch crew was
in town for the funeral but holcombe had
remained behind ostensibly to take care
of the routine chores around the ranch

  slowing to a walk as they approached

the ranchhouse where they believed vol
holcombe would be found the masked
rider and blue hawk suddenly picked up
a rumble of hoofbeats approaching from
the north from the direction of the
slash s

in what was left of the fading day-
light they recognized joaquin musto
and lane scofield jogging down the road
which linked the two ranches followed by
four pack-horses laden with what would
undoubtedly prove to be smugglers loot

  the oncoming riders had not yet spotted
blue hawk and the masked rider who
were partially concealed by an interven-
ing cottonwood clump which had rooted
in the seep of a windmill tank beside the
road

  musto and scofield headed on past the
entrance to the lane leading to the stir-
rup ranchhouse they were not intend-
ing to stop and pick up holcombe or talk
with him then

 the masked rider and blue hawk
waited until scofield and the half-breed
were within a dozen feet of them then
without warning they rode out to con-
front the two fugitives

  lane scofield was the first to recognize
the big black-clad rider on the coal-black
stallion his yell carried overtones of
alarm as he reined his mount to a skidding
halt

 the masked rider musto i knew
him and the injun were supposed to be in
this neck of the woods

  musto drew rein uncertain as to what
to do in this situation then he saw a
glint of gun metal as the masked rider
whipped his arm out from under the ban-
nering folds of his cape that was to be
expected this outlaw could take no
chances

  to one side blue hawk sat his gray like
a graven image the yaqui had a win-
chester balanced across his saddle horn
the muzzle aimed carelessly at musto

  lane scofield put aside his panicked im-
pulse to draw a gun and hurriedly ele-
vated his arms his face gone a pasty gray
in the twilight joaquin musto had also
	masked rider western

put his hands up but an expression of
pleased anticipation was on the outlaw
chieftains coffee-brown face as he stared
at the masked rider

  habla espanol senor masked rider
musto called out

  the masked riders eyes narrowed be-
hind his domino

  si i speak spanish

  a crafty smile took shape under mustos
ropy mustache in the background blue
hawk flashed a quick side glance at his
partner what was the masked rider
stalling for was he waiting for vol hol-
combe to hear the voices out here and
show himself from the nearby stirrup
ranchhouse

  i have long wanted to meet you senor
musto said affably i am joaquin carlos
alamar y musto you have heard of me
no

 the masked rider nodded any
hombre who has ridden the border
country has heard of joaquin musto
senor

  musto appeared flattered we speak
the same language in more ways than
one he said both of us are wanted by
the law you are hunted like a lobo si
si the masked rider agreed that
is only too true

  musto laughed softly i can offer you
safe refuge from gringo law then the
half-breed said not five miles from this
spot i have a hideout you are welcome
there for many years i have hoped one
day our trails might meet

  the masked rider appeared astonished
by mustos offer

 you are inviting me to join your
band senor musto

  the big half-breed nodded the shine
of his grinning teeth broadening in the
gloom

  that is so masked rider join my
band and you will be through with riding
the owlhoot trail like a lobo without a
pack join us and you will be very rich-
lane scofield relaxed his taut attitude
in the saddle

  why grunted the slash s rancher
ill bet that was why the masked rider

and his injun pard headed for this corner
of the territory in the first place musto
knowin hed find safety at your hideout
there was a long silence the masked
rider appeared to be thinking over
mustos proposition

  your offer is tempting admitted the
robin hood outlaw i have heard of you
and looked forward to meeting you senor
musto equally as much as you may have
hoped to meet me

musto took the liberty of lowering
his arms as he saw the masked
rider holster his gun at the roadside
however blue hawk kept his rifle ready
for possible treachery

  youll ride with us then senor mask-
ed rider musto prompted anxiously

  the masked riders shoulders lifted and
fell under his black cloak

  i will think it over senor musto as
you say i have been a lone wolf for many
years running with a pack-shall we
say it is something i cannot decide on the
spur of the moment

  musto laughed affably take your
time amigo if you say the word i will tell
my sentries to grant you safe passage to
our hideout below the border it is not
far from here

  the masked rider shifted position in
the saddle tugging his lower up thought-
fully

  how can blue hawk and myself find
this hideout senor

  musto flashed a triumphant glance to-
ward scofield

  that is information i cannot give you
in advance amigo but i will meet you
at the border fence at the hour you name
to guide you the rest of the way without
me with you you could never get past
my guards

  the masked rider appeared to ponder
this offer finally he said bueno i will
meet you at the border one hour before
tomorrows sunrise senor musto if i de-
cide to accept your offer

  musto scowled and if you dont de-
cide to join us

  if i do not keep my rendezvous with
the outlaw sheriff

  you senor you will know that i have de-
  cided to go on as always this is a vital
  decision for me to make i cannot be
  rushed into a rash move

    this was dismissal musto and scofield
  picked up their reins and lead ropes and
  with a wave to the two mystery riders
  spurred southward to vanish in the gath-
  ering dusk

    when they were out of earshot blue
  hawk said dubiously they plan a
  doublecross senor i do not trust this
  musto

    the masked rider swung out of stir-
  rups and ground-hitched his black stal-
  lion

    nor do i trust him hawk he told the
  indian musto wants to capture us and
  hold us for the rewards on our pelts
  when we visit his stronghold tonight a
  posse from splitrock will not be far be-
  hind

    blue hawk even schooled as he was by
  inheritance to conceal his emotions could
  not mask the concern which his partners
  portentous words had put on him

    you plan to invade mustos hideout
  tonight senor

    the robin hood outlaw grinned

   not as wayne morgan a sheriffs
  legal jurisdiction ends at the border we
  are going to bait a trap tonight hawk a
  trap which if all goes well will see musto
   and all his compadres brought to justice
  before sunrise

   without giving blue hawk time to
 think over this startling information the
 masked rider continued

    lets get over to the ranchhouse and
  locate holcombe if hes not there he may
  be drunk or asleep at the bunkhouse

    with infinite stealth the two mystery
  riders approached the hemingway ranch-
  house there was no sign of life within a
  thirsty calf bawled out in the direction of
  the barns a screech owl clattered its beak
  on the ridgepole of the house

    as they mounted the porch steps the
  two manhunters caught sight of a square
  of paper pinned to the front door from
  the pocket of his chaps the outlaw drew
  the waterproof matchbox which had



played such an important part in their
rescue from the stone quarry earlier

  lighting a lucifer the masked rider
read

  have went to town to attend josh hem-
  ingways funeral back tomorrow

                             holcombe

  so the masked rider muttered dis-
appointment needling him our show-
down with miss stellas foreman must be
delayed well no matter im heading
for town now anyway to arrange with
mcsherry for a posse if holcombes in
splitrock so much the better

  heading back to where their horses
waited blue hawk queried anxiously

  it will be dangerous to ride into split-
rock as the masked rider senor too
many men there are after the bounty on
your head no

  swinging into stirrups the robin hood
outlaw reined midnight around

  im stopping off at the quarry to pick
up my other horse and my wayne morgan
outfit hawk naturally i wouldnt risk
showing up in town as i am now

  i will ride with you blue hawk said
no hawk you will wait here at the
stirrup when i return it will be with a
sizable posse-i hope we will make our
final plans then they are not completely
clear in my own mind at this point

chapter xiii

surprise at boot hill

hadows of late afternoon
waggled ahead of vol hol-
combe when the stirrup fore-
man rode into the outskirts
of the county seat

  passing the splitrock ceme-
tery he saw that a double
funeral was taking place at-
tended by most of the population of the
cowtown that would be the last rites
for the sheriff jeff jennings and old
josh hemingway both victims of a killer

  it occurred to holcombe that he would
probably find the county recorders office


masked rider western

closed for the funeral recording his spu-
rious deeds to the coyotero ranches might
have to wait until tomorrow

  might look better to folks if i showed
up at the boss funeral at that holcombe
decided and reined down the side road
which led to the graveyard

  at the gate of the cemetery holcombe
found a place for his horse alongside the
black-plumed glass-enclosed hearse
wagon which had borne the coffins out
from the undertakers heading into the
cemetery holcombe could hear the nasal
drone of the local skypilot finishing his
funeral sermon

  the lord giveth the lord taketh
away    ashes to ashes dust to dust-

  the crowd attending the funeral had
their backs to vol holcombe as he headed
through the grave plots toward the two
open holes into which the mortal remains
of jeff jennings and josh hemingway had
been lowered

  the minister was leading the assem-
blage in prayer the menfolks standing
with hats off and heads bowed the women
sniffling and keening in their grief

  through a break in the crowd where
the pallbearers had borne the caskets from
the hearse vol holcombe caught sight of
judge mcsherry and his wife with young
luke

  suddenly the stirrup foreman halted
his blood icing in his veins who was that
young woman in the black veil who stood
alongside luke mcsherry at the grave-
side

  stark horror went through holcombe as
he realized the truth the girl was stella
hemingway

  holcombes brain whirled in a stupor of
consternation it could not be hadnt
musto and scofield hurled stella into the
old rock quarry to her doom

  a sick green wave of terror went
through holcombe as he turned and
stumbled back to the cemetery gate
realizing how lucky he was that the fu-
neral congregation bowed in prayer had
not spotted his arrival

  drenched with sweat the panic-stricken
cowhand untied his horses reins and

mounted spurring quickly to put the
hearse between him and the crowd a
thousand tormenting possibilities behind
stellas escape from the quarry seethed
through him if stella was alive then
what about the new sheriff wayne mor-
gan

  had some passing prospector heard
their cries for help and rescued them from
the quarry but that was impossible the
fifty-foot fall would have killed both stella
and morgan

  musto and lane lied to me for some
reason ran the thought through hol-
combes brain as he put the horse into a
gallop heading toward the center of town
but why why they wanted stella
and morgan killed as much as i did

  some of holcombes panic had abated
by the time the buildings of splitrock
shut him off from view of the cemetery
hill through an alleyway he saw that
the funeral services were over men and
women were filing back to their horses
and wagons soon the town would come
to life again stella would be here it
would be fatal for her to see him know-
ing what she did

  holcombe reined up in front of the
courthouse and then he realized that his
dreams of empire were shattered it
would be useless to carry through his
plans of recording the stirrup and slash s
ranches in his name now that stella still
lived

when that realization finally filtered
through the red fog of terror and
despair which obscured his thinking vol
holcombe knew that he was finished in
the territory his only recourse now
would be to head into mexico and become
one of joaquin mustos riders a far cry
from being the wealthiest rancher in the
basin

  self-preservation was now uppermost
in holcombes mind men were already
appearing on the main street how many
of them knew his guilt certainly stella
had told her grim story to luke and old
judge mcsherry holcombe cursed him-
self for not tarrying in boot hill long
the outlaw sheriff	

enough to see if wayne morgan had at-
tended the funeral

  thought of luke mcsherry heaped new
fuel on the fires of heartbreak which con-
sumed holcombe

  if he had to hide in mexico as a fugi-
tive from gringo law it would mean that
stella would be free to marry his hated
rival luke

  darkness was falling over the cowtown
it would be a simple matter for him to
head for the nearby border now and make
his way over to mustos hideout in time

judce ancus mcsherry

he might work his way up to being mustos
segundo

  if i cant have stella vol holcombe
panted then by grab ill make sure that
luke mcsherry dont get her

  jealousy was a canker in the ramrods
soul now one thing was definite in his
mind he would not leave splitrock for
the last time until he had killed both luke
mcsherry and his erstwhile fiancee

  it should not be difficult to do after
attending her fathers funeral with the
mcsherrys stella would undoubtedly go
to the mcsherry home over on agave
street to spend the night

  spurring off the main street holcombe
headed through the gathering twilight to-
ward the north end of town lamplight

glowed in the modest little cottage where
judge mcsherry lived a fringe-topped
surrey stood in front of the house now
the mcsherrys and stella were back from
the funeral

  holcombe hitched his horse behind mc-
sherrys barn and checked the loads in
his six-gun he knew what he would do-
enter the house through the kitchen gun
down stella and luke and the elder mc-
sherrys and be on his way to mexico be-
fore the town had had time to investigate
the rattle of gunfire

  leaving the barn holcombe crept along
a box hedge flanking the judges lawn and
came to a window opening on the parlor
peering through it holcombe saw the
room crowded with people come to offer
stella their condolences

  fuming inwardly holcombe retired to a
dark corner of the yard and squatted
down he would have to wait until the
crowd left and stella was alone with the
mcsherry family before he carried out
his plan

he toyed with the idea of kidnaping
stella and taking her to mexico
with him forcing her to marry him to
save her own life but he rejected that
plan musto did not permit his men to
have wives no stella must die

  nearly two hours elapsed before hol-
combe heard stella and the judee bidding
the last of the visitors good night on the
front porch during that interminable
delay the stirrup foreman had been
tempted a dozen times to give up his
scheme and ride for the border while he
could

  only the thought of preventing lukes
marriage to stella kept him here in-
flexibly bent on destroying them both

  when finally the house quieted down
ol holcombe came out of hiding he ap-
proached the house from the front
marching boldly up the porch steps peer-
ing through the keyhole he saw stella in
mourning sitting down to a late supper
with the mcsherrys with relief hol-
combe saw that wayne morgan was not
with them

to bait a mantrap

              may i will ride with him to his den leav-
              ing a trail of spilled grain behind me for

awn was not far off when
the black-clad figure of the
masked rider riding his
coal-black steed midnight
reined up at the drift fence
which marked the south
boundary of the stirrup and
the border of mexico

                tied behind his saddle can-
tle was a plump sack of seed wheat which
he had picked up at the hemingway ranch
granary when the time came the masked
rider planned to punch a tiny hole in that
sack to leave a trail of spilled grain mark-
ing the route to joaquin mustos hideout
somewhere in the black badlands to the
southward

  the robin hood outlaw had packed an
immense amount of activity into the night
hours behind him as wayne morgan
the outlaw sheriff of splitrock basin he
had left town only after making sure that
judge mcsherry and luke would shortly
be heading for the hemingway ranch with
a heavily-armed posse

  returning to the rock quarry wayne
morgan had once more become the
masked rider in that disguise he had
been waiting at the stirrup ranchhouse
with his yaqui partner when the judge
backed by a forty-man posse reached
coyotero canyon

   it had been a grim suspenseful meeting
there in the darkness of hemingways
ranch yard his black garb making him
invisible to mcsherry and the splitrock
possemen the masked rider had been a
ghostly disembodied voice outlining the
course tonights invasion of mustos hide-
out would take

  musto has promised to meet me at the
border fence shortly before dawn on the
pretext of letting me join his band
the mystery rider had told the assembled
riders i have reason to believe that
musto is more interested in cashing in on
my reward bounty than he is in giving
me shelter in his hideout be that as it

you to follow

 luke mcsherry spoke up from the
darkness thats too much of a risk for
you to take in our behalf masked rider
as a friend of wayne morgans i dont
think its fair to let you bait that trap

  i doubt if wed be able to trail you
until it got daylight anyhow senor an-
other posseman said and itd be plain
suicide to tackle mustos gang after sun-
rise

  the masked rider had reassured them
my companero blue hawk could trail
us in pitch darkness even without the
wheat to follow

  and so with the posse making no secret
of a belief that he was riding to his doom
the masked rider had set out for the
border fence

he knew that joaquin musto was too
clever an outlaw to show himself at
once the mexican bandido would make

                                                                       

sure that he was not being led into a trap
himself for that reason it had been im-
perative for blue hawk and the posse to
wait at the stirrup for at least thirty min-
utes before riding south

  the masked rider felt a tremor run
through midnights frame saw the stal-
lions ears prick up the horses super-
keen nostrils had picked up an alien scent
in this darkness

  then the robin hood outlaw heard the
faintest thud of hoofs in soft sand and
saw a glint of starshine on a cartridge-
studded chest bandolier a rider ap-
proached from a motte of buckbrush on
the other side of the gate

  masked rider a voice inquired softly
in spanish

  si

  ride this way at a walk amigo with
your arms up until i can be sure it is
you

  the voice was not mustos

  he plays it safe the masked outlaw
thought wryly sent a mozo out to pick
me up just in case i was planning a
doublecross

the black-clad figure of the

reined up at the drift fence

boundary of the stirrup and
the border of mexico

  tied behind his saddle can-
tle was a plump sack of seed wheat which
he had picked up at the hemingway ranch
granary when the time came the masked
rider planned to punch a tiny hole in that
sack to leave a trail of spilled grain mark-
ing the route to joaquin mustos hideout
somewhere in the black badlands to the
southward

  the robin hood outlaw had packed an
immense amount of activity into the night
hours behind him as wayne morgan
the outlaw sheriff of splitrock basin he
had left town only after making sure that
judge mcsherry and luke would shortly
be heading for the hemingway ranch with
a heavily-armed posse

  returning to the rock quarry wayne
morgan had once more become the
masked rider in that disguise he had
been waiting at the stirrup ranchhouse
with his yaqui partner when the judge
backed by a forty-man posse reached
coyotero canyon

  it had been a grim suspenseful meeting
there in the darkness of hemingways
ranch yard his black garb making him
invisible to mcsherry and the splitrock
possemen the masked rider had been a
ghostly disembodied voice outlining the
course tonights invasion of mustos hide-
out would take

  musto has promised to meet me at the
border fence shortly before dawn on the
pretext of letting me join his band
the mystery rider had told the assembled
riders i have reason to believe that
musto is more interested in cashing in on
my reward bounty than he is in giving
me shelter in his hideout be that as it



may i will ride with him to his den leav-
ing a trail of spilled grain behind me for
you to follow

 luke mcsherry spoke up from the
darkness thats too much of a risk for
you to take in our behalf masked rider
as a friend of wayne morgans i dont
think its fair to let you bait that trap

  i doubt if wed be able to trail you
until it got daylight anyhow senor  an-
other posseman said and itd be plain
suicide to tackle mustos gang after sun-
rise

  the masked rider had reassured them
my companero blue hawk could trail
us in pitch darkness even without the
wheat to follow

  and so with the posse making no secret
of a belief that he was riding to his doom
the masked rider had set out for the
border fence

he knew that joaquin musto was too
clever an outlaw to show himself at
once the mexican bandido would make
sure that he was not being led into a trap
himself for that reason it had been im-
perative for blue hawk and the posse to
wait at the stirrup for at least thirty min-
utes before riding south

  the masked rider felt a tremor run
through midnights frame saw the stal-
lions ears prick up the horses super-
keen nostrils had picked up an alien scent
in this darkness

  then the robin hood outlaw heard the
faintest thud of hoofs in soft sand and
saw a glint of starshine on a cartridge-
studded chest bandolier a rider ap-
proached from a motte of buckbrush on
the other side of the gate

  masked rider a voice inquired softly
in spanish

  si

  ride this way at a walk amigo with
your arms up until i can be sure it is
you

  the voice was not mustos

  he plays it safe the masked outlaw
thought wryly sent a mozo out to pick
me up just in case i was planning a
doublecross
	masked rider western

there was a jack-knife in readiness
in the masked riders left hand he
swung his arm back and pricked a hole
in the sack of wheat hearing the first
golden grains trickle down on midnights
hoof proving that he was leaving a trail
for blue hawks keen vision to pick up
here at the gate he rode midnight onto
mexican soil

  a dozen yards beyond the drift fence
he was suddenly boxed in by four riders
in vaquero clothing two on each side

  esta bueno one of them grunted
after a close look at the face with the
black domino mask it is the masked one
of whom we have heard

  where is the indio who rides with you
senor asked another rider

  the masked rider laughed my com-
panero blue hawk being a redskin he
preferred to go his own way amigos
yaquis do not get along well with sonor-
ans as you no doubt know

  the mexicans hesitated not sure they
liked this development

   sta nada their spokesman said after
an interval it is not our business but
mustos  and now senor masked rider
we must have your pistolas por favor
the masked rider felt his neck-nape
prickle with apprehension

  senor musto does not trust me yet
he invited me to become one of his
banda-

  the mexicans laughed it is the cus-
tom you understand for new members
when they first arrive senor musto will
undoubtedly grant the great masked
rider the privilege of bearing arms
there was no point in resisting the or-
der too much depended on the timing of
his plans tonight by now blue hawk
would be headed south from the stirrup
with the posse traveling slowly it would
not do to delay things at this juncture

  all right the mystery rider said un-
buckling his gun harness he passed over
his holstered colts a mexican removed
his winchester from its saddle-boot and
they were ready to ride

  this way senor the spokesman said
picking up his reins it is not far to our

casa amigo

  the masked rider was thankful for the
dust which their horses hoofs stirred up
if one of the quartet of guards spotted the
slow trickle of wheat from the ruptured
sack at his cantle he knew they would gun
him down without mercy

  the eastern horizon was beginning to
show pink before the approaching dawn
when the masked riders armed escort
turned into the mouth of an arroyo they
followed the twistings and turnings of the
trail for a quarter of a mile before an
abrupt bend of the dry wash revealed a
wide area where the lamplighted squares
of a casas windows spilled out a glow
which revealed the pole corral where
mustos band kept their horses

  beyond the casa the masked rider saw
where the arroyo continued on into the
towering cordillera musto had chosen
his hideout well there was undoubtedly
a getaway trail beyond the smugglers
headquarters

  reining up in front of the adobe-walled
sod-roofed building the masked riders
escorts dismounted and waited for their
prisoner to dismount

  a hundred yards back along the arroyo
the sack of wheat had been drained empty
in the darkness the presence of the gun-
nysack tied to the masked riders bedroll
occasioned no suspicion on the part of his
guards he doubted if they even noticed
the sack

  this way to the porta one of the mex-
icans said his voice taking on a friendly
timbre now that they had reached mustos
citadel

  the masked rider drew in a deep
breath the die was cast he was alone in
this sinkhole of border outlawry minus
his guns he was completely at mustos
mercy now whether he lived to ride
away from this place depended on blue
hawk and the splitrock posse

he knew this cavalcade had been
watched by armed sentries further
back along the arroyo but they had not
been challenged since their arrival was
expected blue hawks posse would have
to run the gantlet of those guards but they
had been forewarned to expect them and
they had the advantage of overpowering
numbers

 the masked rider flanked by his
guards headed toward the casa the door
was opened and the robin hood outlaw
stepped inside squinting his eyes behind
the domino mask in the glare of the ceiling
lantern

  almost every bunk which tiered the
four walls of this outlaw bastion was filled
with a snoring mexican outlaw at this
pre-dawn hour mustos band was asleep
with the exception of two men who were
playing monte at a table under the lan-
tern they stood up to face the masked
rider and he knew them both

  joaquin musto-and lane scofield the
slash s fugitive

  ah welcome senor rumbled musto
extending his hand to the robin hood out-
law i see that you have decided to join
my contrabandistas no 

  the masked rider nodded aware that
he was under the closest scrutiny from
lane scofield



si he replied it would make my
welcome seem a bit more sincere senor
musto if your men gave me back my
guns

  musto laughed gesturing for his four
guards to leave one of them had placed
the masked riders brace of s and his
winchester on the card table before mus-
to

  you will be allowed to wear your guns
in due time my friend musto said in
spanish suddenly his expression
changed as the door closed the indian
-where is he

  the masked rider repeated the ex-
planation he had given his escort

  that is not so good grunted lane
scofield

  musto sat down his brown hands busy
shaping a black-paper cigarillo thumb-
nailing a match alight he got his smoke
going and the masked rider knew he
was dealing with a dope fiend when he
scented the heady aroma of marijuana
drug in the smoke

  purling smoke through his hawklike

do we have to die

  thirty-nine years ago in forbidden tibet
behind the highest mountains in the world a
young englishman named edwin j dingle
found the answer to this question a great
mystic opened his eyes a great change came
over him he realized the strange power that
knowledge gives

  that power he says can transform the
life of anyone questions whatever they are
can be answered the problems of health
death poverty and wrong can be solved

  in his own case he was brought back to
splendid health he acquired wealth too as
well as world-wide professional recognition
thirty-nine years ago he was sick as a man
could be and live once his coffin was bought
years of almost continuous tropical fevers
broken bones near blindness privation and
danger had made a human wreck of him
physically and mentally

  he was about to be sent back to england
to die when a strange message came-they
are waiting for you in tibet he wants to
tell the whole world what he learned there

under the guidance of the greatest mystic he
ever encountered during his  years in the
far east he wants everyone to experience
the greater health and the power which there
came to him

  within ten years he was able to retire to
this country with a fortune he had been
honored by fellowships in the worlds leading
geographical societies for his work as a geog-
rapher and today  years later he is still
so athletic capable of so much work so young
in appearance it is hard to believe he has
lived so long

  as a first step in their progress toward the
power that knowledge gives mr dingle
wants to send to readers of this paper a
-word treatise he says the time is here
for it to be released to the western world

nostrils joaquin musto fixed his reptilian
stare on the masked rider

  it will be necessary he said men-
acingly for you to remove the mask se-
nor all of us are wanted by the law
here your disguise is not necessary any
longer

  the masked rider saw a bright glitter
of curiosity come alight in lane scofields
predatory eyes

  if that is a condition of joining your
band senor musto the robin hood out-
law said calmly then i must be leaving
no man living with the exception of my
companero blue hawk has seen me with
my mask off

  without warning musto slapped a hand
under the table and brought it up with the
ugly snout of a six-gun resting on the
wood leveled at the masked riders
chest

  manos altos-get your hands up se-
nor snarled the bandit chieftain it is
too late to leave this place you will take
your orders from me sabe usted

  the masked rider slowly lifted his arms
before the menace of mustos gun drop

  he saw lane scofield sidling around the
edge of the table mustos loud voice had
roused several of the sleeping outlaws in
the bunks and their beady snakelike orbs
were fixed on this scene with a roused
curiosity

  what is this snarled the masked
rider stalling for time i trusted you-
i came here under your terms-

  musto joined scofield in a harsh rumble
of laughter

  you are worth only as much as your
reward bounties to me masked rider
the mexican jeered you do not have the
brains people give you credit for senor
scofield take off the masked riders dis-
guise

strangely enough the bayed out-
law made no move toward resistance
as the slash s man rounded the table and
reaching out as gingerly as if he were
drawing a lions fangs with his bare
hands grabbed the masked riders black
domino and jerked it up to he against his

forehead for the space of a dozen sec-
onds scofield stared at their prisoners
exposed face as if he were seeing a ghost

  wayne-morgan he gasped

  the masked rider nodded

  remember he drawled i warned
you both-no man living has ever learned
my secret neither of you will live to cash
in on my bounty

  even as he spoke the masked rider
heard a sudden break of gunshots outside
from down the arroyo blue hawk had led
mcsherrys forty-man posse into the
range of mustos sentinels guns

  taking advantage of lane scofields
stunned paralysis the masked rider flung
himself sideward to put the slash s fu-
gitive between him and joaquin mustos
line of fire he heard the thunder of the
mexicans exploding gun the bullet rip-
ping through space which his body had oc-
cupied the instant before

  the masked riders fist shot out in a
chopping uppercut smashing scofield
across the jaw as the rancher started to
fall the black-clad outlaw yanked a six-
gun from scofields holster and drove a
shot into the ceiling lantern

chapter xv

sunrise showdown

tter blackness engulfed
the bunkhouse room to be
broken by a spurt of orange-
purple flame from mustos
six-gun

  a mexican in one of the
upper bunks witnessing the
abrupt turn of events
opened fire with a  spraying the dark-
ness with a sleet of lead

  the masked riders black garb stood
him in good stead in this perilous mo-
ment he lunged over scofields collaps-
ing form and shoved against the card
table feeling it slam against joaquin mus-
to and drive the big mexican off balance

  as the table overturned on top of mus-
to the masked rider made a blind swipe
of his arm in the darkness and hooked his
the outlaw sheriff	

 hand through the loop of one of his gun-
 belts

  dragging the colt harness off the
 toppling table he dropped to all fours and
 scuttled toward the casa door

   the mexican in one of the upper bunks
 had emptied his gun by now and the
 masked rider took advantage of that
 respite to get the door open

   staggering outside he saw that dawns
 gray light had come over the mountains
 enabling him to see the four mexicans
 who had brought him here in the act of
 riding fast up the arroyo from which
 sounded an ear-riving roar of exploding
 guns

   blue hawks posse was fighting through
 mustos cordon of armed sentries

   the masked riders ear was deaf to the
 pandemonium inside the bunkhouse he
 knew what his job was-to prevent mus-
 tos gang from making their escape before
 the posse arrived

 a whistle brought midnight trot-
 ting over from the spot where his
 escorts had left the big stallion still sad-
 dled strapping his single gun-belt about
 his middle thrusting lane scofields six-
 shooter through the waistband of his
 chaps the masked rider vaulted into
 midnights saddle and rode hard toward
 the dimly-seen gate of the outlaws horse
  corral

   mustos men roused from sleep were
 spilling out of the casa door behind him
 as the masked rider reined midnight to
 a halt alongside the corral and leaned from
 stirrups to unhook the wire fastenings of
 the gate the incessant drumming of
 gunfire from up the arroyo had already
 spooked the outlaws horses penned inside
 the inclosure they needed no urging
 from the masked rider to flood through
 the opening gates adding to the senseless
 confusion which reigned between the
 steep cutbanks of the arroyo in front of the
 outlaw den

  an inhuman yell sounded above the
 pandemonium as the masked rider back-
 ed midnight away from the stampede of
 saddle ponies flooding through the corral
 gate hipping around in saddle the

masked rider saw the big figure of lane
scofield racing toward the corral

  catching sight of the masked riders
black shape against the flaming dawn
light the slash s rancher yanked a six-
gun from leather and opened fire on the
man who had fist-whipped him a scant mo-
ment before inside the cabin

  with scofields lead hammering past his
ear the masked rider curbed midnights
bucking and leveled his gunsights on sco-
fields big shape using scofields own gun

  he squeezed off his shot feeling the vi-
olent recoil of the gun against the crotch
of his thumb through swirling smoke
rings he saw scofield halt blood gushing
from the bullet-hole drilled between his
eyes

  a bolting horse knocked scofield to tha
ground but the gringo renegade was al-
ready dead before a steel-shod hoof
smashed his skull

  the masked rider knew it would be
impossible to fight his way through the
maelstrom of yelling mexicans and milling
horses to reach the posse he reined mid-
night around and headed up-canyon pull-
ing up fifty yards from the corner of the
corral

by now mustos gang would know
that a heavy force of riders from
north of the border were breaking into
their bastion from the west the banks
were too steep for the bandits to scale the
only possible route of escape would be up
the arroyo to the east and they would
find their exit trail blocked by the venge-
ful figure of the wests most celebrated
outlaw

  even as he reined up twin six-guns
covering the narrowing gap of the defile
he saw the vanguard of the splitrock
posse come storming into sight around the
tight bend of the gulch beyond mustos
hideout cabin

  in the flaming dawn he recognized blue
hawks coppery features flanked by
young luke mcsherry and he breathed a
prayer of thanksgiving that his two
friends had lived through the storm of
sentry lead which had greeted them
	masked rid ee western

  swirling dust obscured the scene but
the masked rider knew that mustos
bayed outlaws most of them only half-
dressed were racing back into the casa to
fort up for a siege the air was laced with
criss-crossing lead strident with the
vengeful yells of the possemen and the
bellowing terror of their trapped quarry

  then the masked rider picked out the
figure he had expected to see emerge from
this melee big joaquin musto the
scourge of the border was not choosing
to barricade himself in the bunkhouse
and fight it out with the raiders whom he
had so long bedeviled north of the border

  by sheer luck musto had succeeded in
grabbing the reins of a horse that was car-
rying a saddle-a horse belonging to a
slain posseman or else to one of the four
mexicans who had escorted the masked
rider here from the stirrup drift fence

  in saddle brandishing a - rifle
musto came charging along the corral
fence heading east into the upper can-
yon the outlaw chief was clear of the
pitched battle raging between the arroyo
walls when he spotted the grim black-
clad man he had lured into this trap to-
night waiting for him in the middle of the
trail

  musto reined to a bucking halt lifting
the walnut stock of his - for a desper-
ate try at shooting his way past the mask-
ed rider

  with grim precision the robin hood
outlaw lifted both six-guns and dropped
gunhammers a split instant before musto
could line up his gunsights

  converging lead caught the smuggler
in the chest spilling him bodily over his
ponys rump musto landed on his knees
a gout of blood pouring from his mouth as
he fought the dead weight of his rifle

  then slowly joaquin musto buckled at
the midriff and toppled forward into the
hoof-trampled dirt his blood soaking into
the adobe a tremor wracked the big out-
law from shoulders to legs and he lay
still

  with musto died the secret of wayne
morgans face behind the famous domino

of the masked rider

  spurring past the dead outlaw the
robin hood of the west saw that the com-
plexion of the fight had shifted blue
hawk and the other splitrock riders had
poured a devastating blizzard of lead
through the doors and windows of the
casa where mustos men had taken ref-
uge and now some enterprising splitrock-
er- luke mcsherry it turned out to be-
had set fire to the dry brush which roofed
the structure

  even as the masked rider approached
he saw a flutter of white at a bullet-
smashed window followed by the opening
of the door as mustos legionnaires some
of them bleeding from gunshot wounds
trooped out into the full glare of the sun-
rise in mass surrender

as the masked rider dismounted
w at c h i n g judge mcsherry and
young luke superintending the tying up
of their prey blue hawk the yaqui came
trotting out of the dusty confusion a rare
grin lighting his coppery features

  you are safe senor

  the masked rider grinned gesturing
toward the hoof-trampled corpse of lane
scofield

  unscathed hawk luck was with us
tonight

  more than luck a voice broke in on
their reunion splitrock basin owes
more to you and your friend wayne mor-
gan than it can ever git around to payin
masked rider

  the masked man turned to see goat-
whiskered old judge mcsherry limping
up with outstretched hand the old man
had a bloody sleeve but appeared other-
wise unscathed

  i hope senor judge that your posse
did not suffer too heavily the masked
rider said gripping mcsherrys hand

  therell be a few empty saddles over in
the basin and some busted hearts too
the judge admitted soberly but it was
worth the price we made a complete
wipe-out here is that musto himself lyin
yonder

 the masked rider nodded he saw
the outlaw sheriff	

luke mcsherry coming forward to throw
an arm around blue hawks shoulders

  your indian pard led us smack into
the right arroyo masked rider the
young posseman said and grinned i
swear i didnt see a single grain o wheat
on your trail dark as it was but blue
hawk tracked you like a bloodhound
lukes ebullience suddenly sobered id
give a purty if sheriff wayne morgan
could be here to see this where-all did he
go masked rider last we seen of him
he said hed meet us at the stirrup

 reaching in his pocket the masked
rider drew out a ball-pointed silver star
which jeff jennings had given him with
his dying strength

 wayne morgan told me to give you
this senor mcsherry the black-clad
mystery rider said gently his job as
sheriff of splitrock is finished

  luke stared at the law badge in his
hand

b-but he spluttered id hoped
wayne would keep on bein our sheriff-
i think laughed the masked rider
he felt that the job would fall to you or
someone equally capable

  lukes crestfallen face took on a more
cheerful expression

  no sheriffin for me-you tell morgan
that when you see him young mcsherry
said im gettin married to stella hem-
ingway soon as i can get back to town
and were goin to make the stirrup the
best ranch in the territory together it
wont be so hard now that youve wiped
out mustos wild bunch

  the masked rider turned to pick up
midnights trailing reins

  hey luke interjected if wayne
morgan wont be around id admire to
have you stand beside me at the wed-
ding-

  the black-clad riders smle had a poig-
nant wistfulness as he said

  you can understand why i cannot ac-
cept such an honor senor luke but mu-
chas gracias for the thought

  as a circuit judge young man judge
angus mcsherry broke in tensely i have
influence in high places both in arizona
and in washington d c i believe i can
arrange to get a full pardon for you with
a minimum of delay

  a cloud crossed the keen blue eyes be-
hind the domino mask he knew he must
continue life as a wanted man although
he had dedicated his life to helping the
oppressed and downtrodden people of the
frontier his reward here would be in
knowing that he had lifted mustos tyran-
ny from the ranchers of splitrock ba-
sin

  in arizona perhaps the masked rid-
er said but i am afraid other states and
territories in the west might not be as
friendly to me as you and luke have
been he turned to the young waddy
tell miss stella he said that wayne
morgan and blue hawk and myself will
be at your wedding this afternoon in spir-
it and perhaps one day the three of
us will pay you a visit at the stirrup

run coyote run	

  sez buck this time of year when im
makin my beef gather i shunt all my she-
stuff over onto bucket crick which is
good calvin range well lee hanford an
skeet mustang they took a ride out to

slew of tepee cows heavy with milk
traipsin around bawlin their heads off for
calves they had not long ago but aint got
now yessir somethin is shore gettin
away with some of my slicks

  bosco aint got only part of his question
so he asks again what dyuh figger is
doin it

  dunno growls buck thats what i
want you to find out coyotes mebbe
bosco nods thoughtful-like could be
lot of the varmints along bucket crick
whynt yuh git holt of spotty metcalf
varmint huntin is his trade

  thought of that admits buck but
i hear that spotty is way off somewhere
in the tin can roughs guidin a coupla
dudes on a cougar hunt time he gits
back i wont have a slick left to my name
no somethin has got to be done about
this business right now id put a couple
of my boys out there with a flock of traps
an sech only with the beef gather goin
on im a mite short handed

  bosco sez i cant head out to bucket
crick myself i got to go out to willow
junction tomorrow to testify on a civil
case may be gone ten days or two weeks

boscos words run out kinda
thoughtful up to now i an puggy
an shoo-fly aint been payin too much
attention we figgers that losin slick ears
is one of the penalties a man pays for bein
big an rich an ownin a scad of cattle like
buck kyle does i an puggy an shoo-
fly we dont own nothin but our saddles
an the clothes on our backs which leaves
us plumb free of such worriments

  but now we wakes up to the fact that
bosco is lookin at us kinda purposeful as
the poet feller would say we begins to
squirm considerable knowin from sad ex-

perience how things generally shape up
when bosco takes to lookin at us that-
away

  you three bee-heads sez bosco has
done quite a few chores for me at one
time or another an most of them yuhve
done purty good at bein cursed with
more luck than any three junipers i know
how about you takin a whirl at roundin
up these here coyotes thats threatenin to
make a pauper outa buck kyle

  puggy jimpson clears his throat plumb
uncomfortable like i know what hes
thinkin which is the same as i am this
here bucket crick country is a long way
from town an tug stevens bar its
thirsty country if yuh get what i mean

  me sez puggy i aint never had no
luck with coyotes in all my life bosco
coyotes is smart fellers way faster in the
head than me i aint proud i know my
limits why even a half-witted coyote kin
make a sucker of me any ol day in the
week

  same here chirrups shoo-fly why
one time i shoots me a jack-rabbit an gits
a mite of blood on my britches that night
durned if a coyote dont steal my britches
an drag em way out into the sage brush
on me there i was dum near as nekid
as a jay bird took me three days to find
my britches agin me i go foolin around
any more coyotes im feared ill end up
without a stitch to my name

  bosco gits a kinda sardonic look in his
eye an he bends that look on me whats
yore story ike ferris i suppose the only
reason yuhre a well man today is because
yuhve steered clear of coyotes all yore
life is that it

  well sez i now that yuh mention it
bosco i aint what yuhd call lost me any
coyotes i cant think of a single coyote
im mad at live an let live-thats my
motto

  not any roars buck kyle not when
the slickery varmints is giftin fat feedin

bosco tells us what we gotta do an when
bosco tells yuh why then yuh gotta

  we is to snag ourselves a bait of grub
at willie weehaws store along with a
coupla dozen traps an then head for
bucket crick an begin dee-populatin the
country of veal eatin coyotes buck kyle
he sez hell pay us regular ridin wages
whilst we is busy at this chore but
he reminds us if yuh wanta collect them
wages yuh gotta show me a whole bale of
coyote hides i only pays for results

  when i git back from willow junction
ill ride out that way an see how you is
doin sez bosco bates an like buck
ill expect some results

  all of which explains how it is that a
couple of days later i an puggy an shoo-
fly rides in on this bucket crick range
sets ourselves up a camp an begins look-
in for coyotes trouble was the fust thing
we had to decide on was where to start
lookin

  coyotes sez puggy is plumb unre-
liable critters yuh never know where
yuhre liable to stumble onto one why i
remember when skillet hoberg aimed to
start hisself a chicken ranch out on salt
flat an the coyotes et him right out of
business an all the time ol skillet was
foamin an rampagin around the country
lookin fer chicken stealin varmints
where was the coyotes holed up at why
right under the porch of his cabin plumb
stuffed with prime chicken meat an laugh-
in theirselves sick no sir yuh cant never
tell about a coyote

me i was plumb willin to agree
with puggy an let matters jest stay
put thataway the wilier trees along
bucket crick threw plenty of cool shade
an me i was satisfied to spread my blank-
ets real soft an then spread out on them
to keep the breeze from blowin them
away after which id jest wait plumb
patient for this here coyote business to
straighten itself out all on its own accord
ive found that most things will do that
very thing providin a man has patience
to wait long enough i enlarges on the

idee an puggy is plumb agreed but not
shoo-fly davis

  shoo-fly is kinda like a coyote hisself
in that yuh cant alius figger him trou-
ble with shoo-fly is that every so often he
gits hisself an idee an when he does he
hangs on to it like death to a tall injun
hes got one now

  we has sez shoo-fly gnawin hisself
off a jawful of eatin tobacco a oppor-
tunity to turn ourselves a purty penny
fust off buck kyle is payin us ridin
wages second we has a right to the
bounty on every head of coyote we rounds
up thats five smackers a varmint
county pays two an a half an the cattle-
mens association pays the same thn
theres the hides we oughta be able to
average a dollar a hide anyhow so time
we hangs ourselves up four or five hun-
dred coyotes we is in for quite a chunk
of change

  four or five hundred explodes
puggy shoo-fly you is crazy as a juney-
bug aint that many coyotes in all crea-
tion

   zat so comes back shoo-fly how
do you know you aint never counted
em spotty metcalf hisself told me one
time that fer every coyote yuh see theres
mebbe forty-fifty more scroungin around
in the brush that yuh dont see coyotes
is shy critters they dont advertise their-
selves considerin how hard it is to scrag
a coyote there must be three or four mil-
lion of em runnin loose an i maintains
we is gonna git ourselves a real jag of
em

  with shoo-fly puttin things thataway i
an puggy manages to stir up a mite of
interest how i asks dyuh aim to go
about roundin em up shoo-fly

  thats easy sez shoo-fly we brung
a flock of traps didnt we well coyotes
is four-footed critters they walk they
dont fly all we has to do if figger out
some of the trail the critters walk along
set some traps in it an fust ol coyote
comes moochin along-whang-we got
him five smackers fer bounty one for
the hide six smackers just like that

  puggy still seems a mite doubtful sup-
run coyote run	

posin ol coyote dont step on the trail
where the trap is set supposin he steps
somewhere else what then lots of room
on a trail yuh know

  yuh set enough traps ol coyote is
bound to step in one of em insists shoo-
fly so lets git busy

  the afternoon is purty well along an i
suggests we wait for a new day before
startin this coyote war i is plumb com-
fortable on my blankets lets give ol
coyote one more night of free an joyous
livin shoo-fly i cant git over feelin
tender-hearted about this thing

  shoo-fly snorts an rears up we aint
out here to feel tender-hearted we is out
here to keep tepee slick ears from bein
et raw if yuh gotta feel tender-hearted
ike ferris how about them pore lil slicks
bein stole away from their mammys an
et raw by a flock of thievin coyotes git
up off yore lazy back we got traps to
set

  i an puggy sees there aint no use tryin
to hold shoo-fly down no longer so we
gits up an follers along us luggin traps
an shoo-fly settin em

  now this here bucket crick range is
mostly plumb open country jest sorta
rollin gentle an lazy with bucket crick
windin through the middle of it with lots
of wilier thickets linin it on both sides
shoo-fly he aggers there aint a mite of
use settin traps out in the open country
so we ambles down crick for a good mile
or so an every so often shoo-fly would
find a place he figgers a coyote is shore
to come prowlin an there hed set a trap

  time we git all them traps set the sun
has gone down an shes cornin on dusk
in a way i an puggy feels kinda con-
tented its purty country an there aint
nothin like blue dusk settlin down over
a chunk of purty country everythin
seems kinda soft an cozy an plumb re-
laxed cattle begin settlin down fer the
night an in the wilier thickets lil birds is
beginnin to cheep an talk sleepy-like
 world has quit bustlin around an is
turnin drowsy singin to itself yessir
gents twilight is shore one fine time of
day

we heads back up crick towards
camp amblin along easy care-free
as kids headin home for supper after
mebbe puttin in the day at the ol swim-
min hole we has reached mebbe two
hundred yards of camp an dusk is purty
durn near dark when past a wilier thicket
jest ahead we hears a chain rattle

  instanter shoo-fly is runnin hear
that he whoops thats a trap chain
rattlin we has caught ourselves a coyote
all ready this is easy six smackers
boys jest like pickin it up in the street
cmon

  theres a kinda excitement about this
thing that gits holt of i an puggy we
charges right along at shoo-flys heels an
when he skids around the corner of that
wilier thicket we is fair breathin down his
neck the next second we wishes we could
quit breathin

  for while there is somethin in that trap
all right it shore aint a coyote its some-
thin thats built close to the ground an is
black with white stripes its a great big
ol he-heller of a skunk an i an puggy
an shoo-fly before we kin git our brakes
set an workin has skid right smack up
agin the critter

   skunk he aint missin this oppor-
tunity of a life time hes got the range
dead on his sights is set perfect an hes
got plenty of ammunition of which he
dont waste one smidgin i an puggy an
shoo-fly we gits it an how gentlemen-
an how

  fer a time there i figger im gonna
choke to death-plumb if you aint never
been in sech a fix gents you got no idee
you simply got no idee the air turns
thick enough to cut with a dull knife i
an puggy an shoo-fly we flounders an
skids an shore claws the earth tryin to
git outa there time we succeeds ol skunk
has done two things hes plumb let go
the last shot in the locker an bein only
nipped by one toe in the trap has pulled
loose an ducked into the willers

  we let him go we aint got a mite of
further interest is tryin to run him down
an hawg-tie him not much we aint we
finally scatters out into the open an takes
	masked rider western

stock here the air is a mite clearer an
we gulps it like a man dyin of thirst would
gulp spring water

  but that dont take the smell away i
cant smell puggy an shoo-fly what with
smellin myself an i smell somethin aw-
ful the worst of it is i know im gonna
keep on smellin this way for quite some
time im gonna live with that smell for
days an weeks water an soap sunshine
strong winds an clean earth-theyll all
help but only time can really do the job
-a lot of it

  puggy snortin an wheezin like he had
the hickory heaves finally gets some
words out coyotes he snarls we is
gonna trap some coyotes mr shoo-fly
davis sez we are its a cinch mr davis
claims nothin to do but ketch coyotes
an get rich oh shore jest as simple as
scat ike we is ruined well never be
the same agin nobodyll come near us
nobodyll speak to us our bronc wont
let us saddle em an dawgsll look the
other way when we go by great kee-
ristopher do i smell

 shes what yuh might call a sad an
melancholy camp there on bucket crick
we does the best we kin with the mate-
rials at hand as the monkey sez when he
shaved the elephant with a hoe but there
aint enough water in the crick nor would
there have been if that crick was the mis-
souri river to wash i an puggy an shoo-
fly clean an sweet smellin agin it aint
jest us its our clothes our boots our
hats-jest plumb all of us we smell we
smell to high heaven

  puggy he keeps on rawhidin shoo-fly
an poor shoo-fly he aint got a word to
say he jest hunkers down by the fire
lookin like a man that fate had pulled
the dirtiest trick in the bag agin when
shoo-fly davis gits so low he wont an-
swer back to rawhidin then hes jest
about the lowest mortal they is

  feelin a mite sorry for shoo-fly an
aimin to git the argyment into a more
cheerful channel as the poet feller would
say i suggests that a bite of supper would
mebbe take our minds off our miseries
an off the smell puggy him bein the

best cook gives hisself another scrubbin
an sets to work purty soon they is coffee
steamin in the pot an bacon sizzlin in
the pan we begins to chirk up after all
come to think of it we aint none of us
dead

when that hot coffee an bacon takes
hold even shoo-fly comes alive
could have been worse he opines
could have been a big ol rattlesnake got
tangled in that trap an one of us got bit
fatal an ive hear tell that a feller kin
get used to this skunk smell

  which all wed better comes back
puggy fer were gonna have to live with
it a long long time

  with a good gallon of hot coffee split
between the three of us with a sound
slather of crisp bacon an hot biscuits to
kinda wedge in around it we sorta oozes
back toward normal even puggy shes
a soft warm night with the stars swingin
big an bright in the sky we gits our
smokin goin lays back an watches the
fire die down an begin to crinkle in the
ashes after all whats a lil smell or
even a great big smell providin every-
body smells the same an we all does

  i begins to see where a man could plumb
enjoy this here coyote trappin expedition
an sez so

  now yuhre talkin ike puts in shoo-
fly eager-like i bet come mornin we
find ourselves a whole slather of coyotes
rounded up in them traps we set shucks
what if we did run foul of one lil bitty ol
skunk aint gonna let that lick us is
we

  want no lil bitty skunk growls
puggy it was one great big ol he-heller
of a skunk an he shore lathered us to a
fare-ye-well next time i hear a trap chain
rattle im gonna head the other way until
im plumb shore what kinda critter is
rounded up no more bargin in high
headed an careless for puggy jimpson
you can stick a pin in that

  an you three hombres can stick em
up sez a mean voice from the dark
stick em up-high an quick
gentlemen i swear that for a plumb
run coyote run	

long second or two im so befizzled i cant
move a finger yessir im a plumb par-
alyzed injun but when i hears a gun

alyzed with a rush puggy an shoo-fly

wanta git unhinged with a forty-five slug
all right gyp move in an git that fire
goin agin sody soon as theys enough
firelight to see by you rounds up any
shootin weapons these three pilgrims got
around this camp ill take care of the
owners

  somebody moves up to the fire throw-
in on a armful of dry wood i can hear
this jigger sniffin an sniffin purty soon
in a high squeaky voice he sez holy
christmas what is this a camp of hu-
mans or a skunk nest beer keg they is
somethin powerful ripe around here

  yuhre tellin me sez the mean voice
i dont choke easy but right now im
feelin the fust twinges

  aint long before the fire is blazin high
an purty agin throwin plenty of light
theys a jigger comes prowlin around be-
hind i an puggy an shoo-fly an lifts our
guns its this sody feller an he sez
these fellers must be afraid of ketchin
a flock of pneumony bugs beer keg for
they shore is slathered from ears to hocks
with skunk oil was a pneumony bug to
git within five miles of em itd die a quick
an horrble death pe-e-e-u-u-u

  satisfied that we is plumb unarmed an
helpless this here beer keg gent comes
around in front to look us over so we
looks at him likewise a wise man had
shore named him i bet he want moren
five foot high an jest about as wide his
laigs is short an thick an bowed outa all
common sense from the laigs up hes
built like a sack of wheat-no like four
sacks of wheat all shoved into one his
head is big as a wash basin an set right
spang down agin his shoulders hes got
a plumb mean mouth a blob of a nose an
lil bitty round eyes that is jest as black
an hard an blight as a rattlesnakes jest

lookin at him is enough to give ol ike
ferris which is me the cold shivers let
alone that big ol colt six-shooter hes
wavin care-less like in front of my eyes

  how come you hombres is here de-
mands beer keg whats yore business
an how come yuh smell like a skunk camp
meetin

  we is jest plain workin men puggy
tells him we is here to round up the
coyotes whats been runnin off with buck
kyles slick ears we aims to wipe em
out right down to the last plumb var-
mint

  oh yuh do do yuh sneers beer keg
how yuh figger to do that smell em to
death

  puggy squirms some that was jest a
accident-the smell i mean we sets some
traps fer coyotes an-an-

  an yuh caught a skunk instead was
that it cuts in beer keg whatsa mat-
ter cant yuh tell the difference between
a coyote an a skunk

  durn right puts in shoo-fly plumb
cuttin we kin spot either one of em
second we lay eye on em

  beer keg he looks at shoo-fly kinda
savage like hes not plumb shore that
shoo-fly aint meanin more than meets
the eye as the poet feller sez then he
gives that big gun another wiggle an lets
out the meanest snarl yet

  yuh come to the wrong place to hunt
varmints yuh come to the wrong place
to do anythin but exactly what yuhre
told with me doin the tellin dont yuh
wiggle one lil finger if yuh know whats
good for yuh all right gyp sody-take
their guns their broncs an riding rigs an
take their grub take everythin back an
leave it by the trail then bring our
hosses up an well git busy pickin up a
few prime calves

  how about these three pilgrims beer
keg asks gyp in that squeaky voice of
his mebbe theyll cause us trouble
mebbe yuh better smoke em down an be
done with em

  gentlemen at this turrible suggestion
i begin to shake until i near dislocate my
spine but beer keg shakes his head
	masked rider western

  theyre simple as ground-owls any-
body aint got sense enough to know a
skunk from a coyote aint got sense
enough to pound sand down a rat hole
without broncs they cant go nowhere an
without grub theyll probably starve to
death anyhow time they get things fig-
gered out well be so far away we wont
have to worry naw these jiggers aint
worth wastin powder an lead on git
movin you an sody

there is one thing about time it fu-
gits as the poet feller sez so finally
shes another day a plumb empty an
mournful day for i an puggy jimpson an
shoo-fly davis well anyhow it is for i
an puggy there we is without hosses
saddles guns or grub there we is two
good days of travel from cactus city
there we is

  i an puggy jest hunker down plumb
hopeless but not shoo-fly seems like it
has to take some kind of everything-
against-us situation to really wake that lil
scratch cat up hes prowlin around
snarlin an cussin through his whiskers
seein if there aint somethin that beer
keg an them other two ornery pups has
overlooked all he can find is a coil of
picket rope but shoo-fly gathers this up
an comes over to i an puggy

  come alive you two bee-heads he
growls git yore brains to workin we
gotta figger this thing out

  shes already figgered moans puggy
beer keg saw to that all i kin see ahead
of us is one awful long hungry walk home
an right now i aint jest man enough to
start

  shoo-fly dont seem to be listenin i
got it figgered purty good he sez i
savvy about them missin calves beer
keg an them other two bee-heads been
snaggin em up at night an takin em
away on pack hosses seen it done one
time durin a heavy winter even helped
at it had to move them lil slicks outa the
snow yuh put a sack on each side of a
pack hoss an yuh shovel a slick ear into
each sack then yuh light out an lug em
off two to a hoss purty slick idee for calf

rustlers yuh can move em fast an move
em far an yuh dont leave no calf tracks
as yuh go yuh jest leave hoss tracks
which could tangle up some folks

  all right mumbles puggy yuh got
that angle figgered out now figger this
one whats bosco bates an buck kyle
gonna say an do to us when we drift in
to cactus city an admit we got caught
with our pants down an robbed of jest
about everythin but our skins besides
lettin them jiggers run off with a passel
more of tepee calves yeah what then
nothin sez shoo-fly we aint gon-
na tell bosco or buck kyle we aint
headin back for cactus city we is head-
in right after mr wise guy beer keg an
his friends an we is gonna ketch our-
selves a flock of coyotes yet two legged
ones

  what bawls puggy us go prowlin
after them tough jiggers with nothin but
our bare hands to fight with with our
bare empty hands shoo-fly davis you
is loco as a chipmunk

  our hands aint so plumb empty sez
shoo-fly we got this coil of picket rope
an a flock of number four steel traps we
kin gather up

  how sez i gettin into the argument
how do yuh figger to do anythin with
a chunk of rope an a flock of steel traps
dunno right now shoo-fly sez plumb
confident-like but ill figger out some-
thin as i go along an its time to start
as we got them traps to gather up lets
go

  go yoreself an be durned explodes
puggy i aint that crazy

  shoo-fly stands up plumb haughty
all right he sez ill go by myself i
aint so low-down an yaller an spineless
that i quit when the goin gets tough an
if because im all by my lonesome i git
strung on a forty-five slug an kilted
plumb you twoll have a long time to
think about it yuh wont be able to eat
yore victuals an yuh wont sleep good at
nights rememberin how yuh let a ol pal
go to his vilent death all alone so-long
an remember me to the boys in cactus
city
run coyote run	

  with that off that durn lil bee-head
marches i looks at puggy an puggy looks
at me puggy starts to git up

  durn him puggy near sobs durn
his ornery hide now we got to go along
ike now we got to

  i nods of all the locoed messes weve
ever done mixed up in puggy this is the
locoedest but yuhre right we gotta go
so we pegs away down crick pickin up
the traps wed set the night before there
aint a mite of nothin in any of em which
dont seem to bother shoo-fly a bit for
now hes got hisself a new idee an hes
plumb bouncin with eagerness to git
about it

soon as we git them traps gathered
up an divided among us to pack
shoo-fly cuts away from bucket crick an
starts rangin around to pick up the tracks
left by beer keg an his two no-good
friends shoo-fly aint long in doin this
for thered been quite a slather of hosses
we heads out follerin that sign an i can
see some long blistery miles ahead like-
wise does puggy an he cusses until he
runs outa breath but i an him we keep
peggin along after shoo-fly whos leadin
the way like a eager beagle hound on a
hot jack-rabbit track

  gents id hate to guess how far we
walked that day i know we walked until
ifiggered id wore my laigs plumb down
to the ankles i know we walked until my
feet hurt so bad i coulda sat right down
an blubbered like a kid i know we
walked plumb outa flat country an into a
country of crooked busted up hills i
know we walked all day an didnt git
nowhere until just about sundown an
then we got there all of a sudden an
plumb at once

  shoo-fly hes uo ahead an jest toppin
another one of aboift ten thousand ridges
wed topped since we hit them cussed hills
soons he could look over the top of that
ridge shoo-fly stopped plumb sudden
then ducked down an come skitterin back
to i an puggy

  we done her he whoops soft-like
we done her we caught up with them

three bee-heads cmon fellers crawl
up easy an take a look

  crawlin groans puggy thats jest
about all im good for now

  me im not better off than puggy is but
we follers shoo-fly up to the top of that
ridge flattens down an takes a cautious
look we see plenty

  down past the ridge the country breaks
into a sizable flat an mebbe a quarter of
a mile out across that flat theres a old
cabin standin back of the cabin is two
pole corrals in one of them corrals is
a flock of calves in the other is a real jag
of hosses an right away i kin identify the
bald-faced blue roan id been ridin up to
last night shoo-fly is right weve done
come up with them durned thieves

  puggy lets out a big sigh all right
there they is they got grub an broncs an
guns here we is we aint got no grub
no broncs no guns all we got is a hunk
of rope an a slather of durned varmint
traps out yonder in that cabin is yore
coyotes mr shoo-fly davis how you
gonna ketch em

  shoo-fly has got a funny light in his eye
an a plumb happy look about him like
a fox eatin fishworms comes late night
ill show yuh mr jimpson right now we
got a few hours to kill make the most
of em

  which all i an puggy does we spraggle
right out flat on the ground an rests our
weary bones im hungry enough to gnaw
rawhide an i can see puggy is plumb
ganted down too but shoo-fly hes plumb
busy as a beaver hummin to hisself as he
skitters up to the ridge top for a look every
now an then after which he comes down
an stretches that picket rope out an sorta
acts like hes figgerin its length then he
takes them pesky traps an checks em over
careful like they was somethin made of
gold thats when outraged nature takes
over as the poet feller sez an i go to
sleep

tts plumb dark an reasonable late
by the stars when i wakes up with
shoo-fly shakin me

  come alive ike come alive time to
	masked rider western

go git ourselves some coyote scalps cmon
puggy-up an at em seems i recall mr
wise guy beer keg sayin we didnt have
sense enough to pound sand down a rat
hole well heres where we show that
wise hairpin different

  i an puggy struggle up groanin our
miseries im plumb daid half way to
my neck moans puggy right now i
couldnt ketch me a spavined flea let alone
a two-legged coyote with a gun shoo-fly
theres still time fer us to turn sane an do
some back-trackin

  when we goes back we rides back like
men sez shoo-fly git a handful of them
traps you two an cmon an fer gosh
sakes dont rattle them traps or make any
noise

  which is a large order as i an puggy
soon finds out luggin a slather of steel
traps without them or their chains settin
up a clankin an a rattlin whilst scrougin
along on a dark night aint the simplest
chore in the world but i an puggy does
our best an i reckon it was good enough
for we foller shoo-fly down to the flat an
across it without gittin too tangled up

  by n by shoo-fly stops an now he
whispers plumb soft you fellers start
settin them traps set em all an dont
make no noise whilst doin it ill be back
purty quick

  before i or puggy can say a word shoo-
fly done skids off into the dark soft an
easy as a injun puggy an i get busy
settin them traps thats another chore
i wouldnt want to tackle agin for whilst
a number four trap aint exactly a bear
trap its still a purty hefty article with
springs that take a heap of squeezin down
before yuh can git the jaws open the snap
latch across an hooked to the pan like-
wise an besides was somethin to slip
a man could come durn near losin a finger

  but i an puggy we has our orders an
one way an another we git them traps all
set an laid out in a row before shoo-fly
gits back by this time bein plumb woke
up agin an our eyes adjusted to the dark
we is able to see purty good what with the
stars layin down a silvery glow

  purty soon shoo-fly comes hustlin back

them traps set where are they

  i shows him then sez looky here
shoo-fly them traps might be big enough
to ketch a four-legged coyote but they
aint gonna grab an hang on to any two-
legged one

  thats what you think murmurs
shoo-fly jest you wait an see stay put
whilst i git them traps in place

  sayin which he gathers up a couple of
them set traps an heads for the cabin
again which now i an puggy kin make
out in the starlight we kin see shoo-fly
injun up to the front of it and paw around
in the dust some then he comes back for
a couple more traps he keeps this up
until hes got all them traps put just
where he wants em an when he fin- 
ishes an comes back to us he tells us what
to do

  he says to us ike goes in to one corner
of the cabin puggy to the other i got
that picket rope stretched across the door
jest high enough to trip a man cornin out

i got them traps spread jest about where
a tripped mans hands would hit when he
comes down on all fours once them three
jiggers git theirselves a couple of handsful
of traps they wont be able to use no guns
or nothin else thats when we pile in an
comb their ears back each picks hisself
a man ike you think you kin handle
beer keg

  right now with em standin between
me an a hoss an a square meal of hot
grub i could handle five beer kegs i sez
turn yore wolf loose

  which shoo-fly does soon as i an puggy
has worked our way in to the cabin cor-
ners shoo-fly he cups his hands around
his whiskers an lets out the durndest
blood chillin hair raisin screech mortal
man ever let go he not only does it
once he does it three-four times

  theres some sleepy cussin inside the
cabin then gyps squeaky voice lets out
a kinda squawl injuns boys must be
injuns lets get outa here

  they come out arunnin beer keg is
the fust one hes straight up when he
hits the door then his feet tangle up an
he comes out all spraggled his hands
run coyote run

  spread to ketch hisself the second his
  hands hit the ground i heard one of them
  ol steel traps go ker-chunk

     beer keg he lets out a whoop an
  a holler an whilst hes tryin to claw free
  of one trap he gits his other hand into
  another then he does bawl

       yp an sody chargin out right behind
  beer keg they trips over the picket
  rope shoo-fly has stretched across the door
  an takes a frawg leap same as beer keg
  when they lands they start gittin snagged
  by them traps an its now that shoo-fly
  yells tie into em boys-tie into em

    i takes me a run an a jump an lands
  on beer keg i dont land gentle i got
  my knees doubled under me an i land on
  em smack in beer kegs middle that
  was fightin shrewd ill tell a man for he
  lets out a loud groan an goes purty limp
  right then an there but one way or
  another we go rollin over an over an
  i can feel them cussed traps snappin an
  grabbin at my back an shoulders but
  i got my hands locked into beer kegs
  throat so i dont get them tangled

           listen to bill wilson expound on those tough
           critters who are always a friend of man

we were discussing mules that
day-bill wilson and i

one fact about mules for
sure opined bill wilson from where we
perched on the opera rail of the pole cor-
ral you can always depend on them be-
ing mules theyre hardy dependable
independent and intelligent without pre-
tensions to grandeur of course like hu-
man beings now and then one of them
turns outlaw

  but in the tough hard spots of the

world wherever men venture you always
find mules along

  gazing over the immensity of the coun-
try from that corral hung on the side of
navajo mountain at rainbow lodge
arizona one could well believe it for
miles north and west and south extend a
weird maze of canyons mesas buttes and
gorges of the colorado and san juan
rivers there are no roads whatever and
few slender trails worthy of the name

  in this fantastic land back-of-beyond

an informative true-fact feature


mules are always mules



the answer to all surface transportation
problems is spelled m-u-l-e

  w w wilson better known as bill is
an expert on mules he should be for he
has used them over a large part of the
world during a lifetime he has raised
trained packed and ridden mules he
started working mules as a boy all across
western america with the army in the
philippines from  to  back in the
west as a cowboy then with the national
park service and for the last  years at
rainbow lodge his knowledge of mules
is extensive his mule lore so great that
naturally when i wanted to know more
about them i went to bill

mules traced back to asia

  the story of the mule goes way back
into ancient times when man crossed
asiatic asses with horses his lineage is
just as important as that of any equine
this hybrid animal first reached what is
now the united states through mexico
jennets were bred on spanish mares pro-
ducing a small mule that later became de-
signated as indian mules

  it remained for the colonies especially
those producing cotton and tobacco to
develop what is today the big american
mule the records tell us that breeding
mules started shortly after the revolu-
tiqnary war when george washington
was presented with a black jack and a
jennet catalonian asses by the king of
spain tradition holds further that these
asses were shod with silver shoes next
lafayette gave washington a maltese
jack there were other importations in
particular three recognized breeds of
asses the gray andalusian from south-
ern spain the black majorca and the
short legged poitu from france from
these five have come our highly regarded
indispensable american mules

  a jack bred to a mare produces what
we call mule a stallion bred to a jen-
net gets an offspring known as a hinny
actually breeding mules found no great
favor until the opening up of the middle
and far west then they came into their

heyday because of the great amount of
work necessary that a horse could not
produce during this period appeared the
missouri mule this same animal was
likewise bred in kentucky and tennessee
it is a big boned coarse mule standing 
hands or better it is the result of mating
an improved jack of  to  pounds
with a draft breed type mare

  as the west was gradually settled rais-
ing better mules extended all the way to
the pacific coast as beasts of burden the
mule is employed in every possible indus-
try on the plantations of the south min-
ing lumbering road construction packing
and trail making mules were used exten-
sively by the army in the indian cam-
paigns notably against the sioux and
apache in all our wars including the
last mules had a part from pulling artil-
lery pieces to taking food and ammunition
up into the lines

  at one time mules were the principal
power on the great farms of the nation
mechanization of the farm did not dis-
pense with them altogether as there re-
main operations necessary for their em-
ployment

  mules vary in size from  pounds to
better than  they stand all the way
to  hands their coat colors range from
gray and the african yellow hues through
browns to black reds and grays to pure
white

  there are even spotted and pinto mules
they inherit definite characteristics from
dam and sire notably the big jackass
ears and an off-key unforgettable hee-
haw the missouri mule is remarkable
for its definite horse pattern on the
nose ie the dark colored mules are of a
light contrasting hue from the tip of the
nose up past mouth and nostrils

  temperament of the parents is strongly
pronounced in mules which is why in
the larger beasts of burden the dam is
selected from one of the more docile types
such as the percheron for instance

  for intelligence contrary to popular
conception of a stubborn ungainly ani-
mal the mule is far from dumb indeed
as bill claims the expression jugheaded
	masked rider western

as a mule is far from correct the mule
isnt jugheaded dumb or forgetful in
the matter of remembering the mule
often outshines the supposedly more in-
telligent and superior horse once he
learns something definite the mule isnt
likely to forget it

  if a mule is skeptical of a piece of trail
or a bridge says bill sagely put a rope
on each fore-foot pull on one rope then
the other

  mules learn where horses dont

  bill recalls a new mule that once balked
at a bridge he used this method and
thereafter that mule never hesitated on
that bridge again having learned it was
safe to cross over he proceeded without
pause

  some horses never learn to cross a
bridge on the other hand there is the
story of how mules spooked at some par-
ticular spot on a trail will shy every time
they reach there again

  a pack mule learns one thing quickly
where the panniers and saddle will be re-
moved in camp or at the corral he will
go to that exact spot every time bill had
a -pound black mule called old
tom who had his own idea as to un-
loading no matter how late old tom
might be in arriving at the unloading
place he cunningly maneuvered himself
through the entire train to be on hand for
bill to free him first

  in the same bunch was dynamite
with the opposite inclination on the
final stage of the trip dynamite would
slow down sometimes even disappearing
from immediate sight he would bide his
time coming up to bill to be unloaded
only when all the others were free and
rolling around on the ground

  dynamite was one of the best pack
mules bill ever owned descending a can-
yon trail one day dynamite slipped and
broke the left fore-leg between foot and
ankle he looked around spotted bills
position and on three legs hobbled over
to be unloaded and cared for of course
there wasnt in that remote area anything

much to be done saddened by the acci-
dent bill asked one of his cowboys to do
the merciful thing and went away from
there so he wouldnt even hear the fatal
shot but the cowboy knowing how bill
felt worked poor dynamite down to level
ground around a spring where grass grew
thick dynamite though always crippled
survived there several years longer

  mules a herd of them from small ones
for children to ride to some  hands for
packing supplies are kept at rainbow
lodge to transport dudes and their be-
longings to world famous rainbow nat-
ural bridge around and on top of slum-
bering navajo mountain and into the
mass of weird and amazing canyons of the
western navajo country this has been
bills business for the past  years

  why does he use mules exclusively

  because of their all-around general
ability stamina and intelligence for the
protection of the people who ride the -
mile canyon trail to the natural bridge

  a horse bill says when he becomes
hot and nervous will plunge right on
through a close dangerous place this is
why a horse is at times uncertain on a
trail and liable to fall not the mule he
will look the situation over before mov-
ing he seldom gets into serious difficulties
because he takes time to think it out

  the mule has a tough thick hide his
senses are acute his feet are shaped for
leverage and are tough and durable the
legs are well muscled and made to stand
up under weight in the most difficult ter-
rain furthermore and an important fact
why mules were used in the winning of
the west they can forage and live well
where other animals including the horse
would starve to death his only counter-
part in this respect was the mustang

  it was these qualities which endeared
the mule to the army the saying as
tough as an army mule meant something
the mule took the army over desert
mountain plains across swollen rivers
and through tropical climes all this on a
daily ration of ten pounds of grain and
-pounds of hay-when they could get
the hay
mules are always mules	

  a horse can be kept going until he kills
himself a mule is too smart for that
traveling only to a definite point of ex-
haustion however the mule can be
turned loose permitted to refresh himself
by rolling on the ground and will be fit
to continue going a while longer the
horse may get there faster but the mule
will walk the best of them to death by
going farther

mules were used in philippines

  in the philippines bill packed every-
thing on mules around the island of luzon
food ammunition guns mail and even
the paymaster into the remotest areas of
jungle and mountain during the cam-
paigns against insurrectos one job he
had was rushing fresh meat to the outly-
ing posts these trains were in strings
of fifty mules led by a belled mare that
also carried the cooking utensils several
such trains would be loaded on the same
ground all mixed up yet when they were
ready to depart every mule fell into prop-
er place in line behind the right belled
mare

  most mules are curious and friendly
critters they are especially interested in
calves and young foals playing with them
often to the point of unintentional injury
and so have to be watched their insati-
able curiosity saved many a homestead
wagon train or army detachment from
massacre by warring redskins

  anything unusual in the vicinity or
approaching with stealth sends them forth
to investigate they will spot dangerous
trail bad footing ready-to-fall bridges
and adverse situations before a man
usually does they will give warning of
the approach of dangerous wild animals
and in the cases of snakes will walk right
up to where one is coilpd rattlesnakes
in the southwest have a habit of lurking
in sagebrush the mule will promptly go
there but not one has yet been found
crazy enough to stick his nose within
striking distance

  most people believe that due to his
mental make-up a mule has to be broken

with considerable punishment bill stout-
ly denies this is ever necessary it is cer-
tain he never abused an animal in his
life including mules his method of
breaking and training mules is not by
beating them over the head with a club
he uses kindness and tact teaching the
new mule what is expected of him al-
ways he makes sure the mule understands
what he is to do if he fails to learn some
specific thing immediately or makes a
mistake it is best that he knows he isnt
going to be punished for it

  abuse and mistreatment has made all
the outlaws and balky mules declares
bill once a mule really turns outlaw it
is next to impossible to bring him out of
it

  one example he cites was the case of a
black mule bought for rainbow lodge
this mule had been tortured and abused
until he was an impossible bravo no
manner of re-training and hard work
proved successful finally the mule was
sold to a firm shipping work animals to
the bahama islands to pack bananas

old abe won fame

  on the other hand bills long experi-
ence with mules and his methods of han-
dling them proved strikingly successful
with old abe after his reformation at
rainbow lodge old abe became so fa-
mous from being written about by noted
visitors every guest arriving at the lodge
wanted to ride him

 when this request was made at the
saddling corral the guide would say with-
out batting an eye yes sir whoa abe
and boost up the dude every other mule
at rainbow lodge must sometime or
other been renamed temporarily

 when old abe first came to rainbow
lodge the guides claimed he was cinch
bound he certainly tossed the guides
around every time they tried to ride him
given the opportunity he broke packs
loose rubbed them off and laid down
when they tried to work him old abe
sure looked hopeless

bill sized him up discovering his in-


masked rider western

telugence greater than the average he
promptly took over the job of re-training
old abe how did he do it

  in the first place bill avers the man
who trains or breaks one has to have
more horse sense than the mule just
to be ornery a mule will spend days or
even weeks thinking up little stratagems
to avoid doing what he doesnt want to
you have to out-think the mule

  after a few days work bill got old
abe to where he could be handled as
gentle as a lamb taking him for his per-
sonal trail mount indeed bill used old
abes superior intelligence to re-train
him turning it from pure cussedness to
the opposite given something to devote
this excess energy and intelligence to
old abe decided he was boss mule of
the whole spread thereafter when he
wasnt following bill around he took over
the job of making the other mules be-
have

  bill never swears at a mule since his
successful training of them has been short
of the incredible there vanishes another
adage of mule lore that you have to talk
the mules language to him with plenty
of swear words to make him savvy

  mule production in the united states
has dropped off the last few years to the
extent of arousing some alarm of course
mechanization of the great farms of the
middle west contributed greatly to this
fact it used to be that raising mules was
the exclusive big business of specialists
now with the decreased demand stock-
men and farmers have gone to breeding
their own not a horse ranch or a cow
outfit but what raises a few

  it is another misconception that mules
cannot be trained to handle cattle some

mules have been noted cutters the same
work for which horses are specially
trained mules also learn to handle a
tied-fast rope with a hell-raising critter
on the other end but they are not espe-
cially desired for work with cattle due to
one failing this is because a mule may
work day after day with cattle but there
comes a time sooner or later when he de-
cides he has had enough then and there
he goes cold jawed

  around navajo mountain at rainbow
lodge the mule is the ideal saddle and
pack animal we find this true all through
the mountainous and desert country of
the west his service as a pack animal
could not be done without	

  how much weight can a mule pack
this depends on the size of the mule and
the country to be traveled a -pound
blocky type mule in trains can be loaded
like this the first pair  pounds each
the second pair and so on  pounds

  at rainbow lodge on smaller mules
weighing  to  pounds and in the
worst possible terrain on canyon trails
mules are packed for short distances with
 pounds

  on medium distances they carry 
and for long distances  is considered a
load

  mules should not be kept under packs
more than six hours a day

  the cavalry using aparejos packed 
to  pourids per mule and travelled 
miles per day

  how long is the life span of these
tough critters i asked bill

  thirty years even with plenty of hard
work he replied and by the jinks its
not unusual indeed it happens frequently
some mules live to be fifty years old

      corporal dave stilman
      of the mounties
      battles to bring two
      desperate criminals
      through the wilderness

corporal dave stilman hadnt
time to go for his gun the whis-
tling club sent him sprawling over
the gunwale of his beached boat dropping
him face down on the ice-cluttered
shingle

  hed made an excusable mistake con-
sidering the vastness of the northern
hinterland yukon territory hed figured
the alleged killers indian carne and red
passon were a full day ahead of him
down river but they had cut back to
ambush him

  when he awoke to roll over groaning
onto his back stars were shining above
as if in mockery for the weather had
been the element chiefly responsible for
dave stilmans inability to catch up with
his quarry

  his head throbbed but his teeth chat-
tered with the cold he was very wet
slush ice was running in the river and a

came drew his knife and whirled in

lot of it scattered over the flat shingle

  now stilman started sitting up he
cocked his aching head he was listening
for the chutter of the old inboard motor
on which he been working two hours
when attacked a slow mirthless smile
pulled at his mouth corners as he thought
of that ancient old motor

  youll not get far with asthmatic ol
coffee pot he said in the general direc-
tion of the northeast downstream

  he got to his feet shook himself like a
big husky lead dog ready for battle ac-
tion then turned in to the brush where
shortly he had a fire going and a pot of
strong tea brewing

he grimaced as he sat drinking the
hot stimulating tea wondering what his
	masked rider western

immediate superior sergeant raymond
would have to say there had been grape-
vine talk of raymond being replaced
going to the outside to a staff job and
dave stilman had secretly hoped for
raymonds post with a sergeantcy he
wondered where raymond was tonight
perhaps somewhere up the big river
on routine patrol it was inspector brant
who had assigned stilman to the trail of
the alleged slayers of the prospector
hardrock evans up along the pelly

  the corporal swore bitterly under his
breath no matter what happened now
raymond would smirk when he read the
corporals report raymond didnt make
mistakes-at least he hadnt made any
since he and stilman worked out of
the same northern detachment

  stilman shrugged filled and lit his pipe
he suddenly dug his teeth sharply into
the stem and got to his feet frank mason
from whom hed hired the big boat with
its fractious inboard motor would have a
powered canoe dave figured he could
make it to the post in three hours

  he slung his kit together grateful for
the warmth of his now dry clothing and
headed into the deepening night whose
wind was attuned to the pitch of hissing
light snow shortly more than throe hours
later he grinned as eyes of light winked at
him through the gloom and snow fog

inside another hour he was comfort-
ably fed and uncomfortably hot and
sweated as he yanked seemingly in vain
on the starter cord of an old outboard
motor

  i never said the blasted thing would
start even dave frank mason said in
his own defense as stilman looked up
to glare at the factor in the lantern light
had her out goose-hunting a week ago
and she nearly drove me crazy wish
id suspected those two strangers when
they called at the post for grub they
claimed they were heading up into moose
country-going to kill a winters supply of
moose and head into the bush trapping
for the winter

  dave stilman started that would

mean theyd turn in up the white river
an maybe hit one of the creeks provid-
ing their engine would take them that far
thats the best moose country i know
frank right

  right my indian boys are breaking
their hearts because i wouldnt allow
them to take the inboard job up too
risky with that motor so bad and the
ice running thick

  stillman had given the starter cord
a frantic jerk there was response the
motor caught and sputtered he adjusted
the feed and grinned up at his friend

  sling me a bait of grub together a
couple of spare sheer pins and-

  gun dave mason cut in i noticed
youd lost your own okay boy dont
leave that motor keep her running and
even then dont bank too much on her
she can drive you nuts when youre sure
that all the worlds all right ill put
plenty of oil and gas aboard ready in
fifteen minutes

  patience was a very necessary virtue
amoung the members of the mounted
dave stilman had plenty but it almost
deserted him when the motor suddenly
coughed out but by the time mason
arrived with his trail kit the fickle
heller as he called it was purring
sweetly

  they shook hands sergeant raymond
will likely call in a few days frank
the corporal said as he made ready to
shove off you dont need to tell him all
the details of my misfortunes just say i
had some engine trouble i know ive got a
couple of tough jaspers on my list and
theyll be no less tough knowing im on
their trail i think i can take them if that
old inboard plays the way i want it if
anything goes wrong ill leave trail sign
raymond can pick up so long and
thanks a million and say- mason was
shoving the canoe out

  yeah he called out

  tell your indian boys that if i see
a herd of moose ill either tie em to a
tree grove or herd em up river

  mason chuckled he had the deepest
respect and admiration for the hard-
hangnoose babbitt	

hitting corporal who seemed to get more
than his share of tough breaks on the
toughest assignments in the north

stilman bucked ice for two days
he cut a sheer pin and was forced
with cold-stiffened fingers to make a
replacement he was drawing in close to
the mouth of the tributary white river
when his engine conked out

  he seized a paddle and almost wrenched
his shoulders from their sockets before
at last he was able to swing the canoe
into slack water the ice from the big
river backed up the whites mouth
stilman was caught between two driving
forces-backing ice and the current from
the tributary with its own hazard of
running ice

  he made a night camp and his eyes
danced with grim satisfaction as he saw
sign of a recent occupancy of this particu-
lar site

  theyve started to hit into real
trouble he told himself as he toyed
with a flat wrench hed picked up on the
bank there was a broken bolt lying
near by

  as he ate his supper stilman reviewed
the assignment so far he figured his
hunch that the killers wouldnt risk an
attempt at an up river escape to the out-
side knowing that all points along the
yukon would be closely watched

 since they had all hardrock evans
dust with them they would have no need
to trap theyll kill a supply of moose-
meat and hole up was the corporals
conclusive decision  

  two evenings later stilmans hunch
developed into solid fact as he swung
his canoe into the mouth of a small al-
most totally frozen creek

  he had barely found the only open
channel in the creek when he froze his
paddle hard down on the gunwale two
rifle shots crashed a slow smile began
plucking the corporals mouth wide

  ahead he glimpsed definite sign that
the men had broken ice recently he
quivered realizing that he must now be
close up on the big boat which somehow

had brought the killers to the moose
country

  okay he said softly youll still
be needing that boat to get you out of
this territory you wouldnt be foolish
enough to hole up here its too wild
even for a couple of killers

  he swung his canoe inshore stepped
out onto solid ice and growled under his
breath as he glared at the useless motor
beaching the canoe he strode inland he
was parting a thicket when suddenly a
young bull broke stilman froze in his
tracks

  suddenly he ducked as a rifle bullet
cut brush above his head two more
shots crashed then all was still save for
the lingering echoes of those reverbera-
tions

  stilman was conscious of danger as
dusk settled about this grim wilderness
he could instantly have chartered a
course for his climactic action had there
been but one man one killer to cope
with moose-hunting men could be
separated by miles

  suddenly he stiffened he heard voices
this could be it feller he told him-
self sliding a hand down to the butt of
his borrowed 

  a sharp wind freshened he felt the
flick of hard snow in his face and swore
bitterly to himself

  now his nostrils quivered he tanged
the smell of smoke the men were build-
ing a fire near by he caught the sound
of axe-work from a point some one hun-
dred and fifty yards distant and a sharper
more distinctive noise from closer in the
men were separated one was at work at
the campsite while the other went deeper
in the bush after dry wood

  as he moved cautiously forward swing-
ing wide to come in around the man in the
bush stilman shuddered as he heard
the strengthening wind in a near by tama-
rac swamp dry limbs creaked and
groaned or clacked together like skele-
ton shapes in a dance macabre

  as he sifted into a small tamarac swale
he heard the close in sounds of an axe
biting at dry wood in the half light he
	masked rider western

glimpsed a bent and broad-shouldered
form

  passon he told himself as he stepped
forward the man was stooped gathering
up an armful of small dry limbs when
stilmans voice froze him

  hold it passon this is the law

  stilman held his voice down realizing
that voice sounds carry far in the wilds
he moved slowly in cautiously suddenly
his quarry whirled it was an amazing
move passon was driving for the bole of
a tamarack against which his rifle leaned
but before he reached the winchester he
ducked came whipping around to hurl
a deadfall club stilman ducked he
darent risk a shot but he must risk some
action

  he leaped forward passons right hand
had barely closed on his rifle when the
corporal struck-a short sharp blow with
the barrel of his  passon crashed
hard against him but stilman stepped
back allowing the lumbering form to
drop to the ground

  first you have the bad breaks-then
the good ones come stilman told himself
a moment later as he slipped a set of hand-
cuffs about passons wrists he secured
the big man to a tree

  thatll hold you while i make a call
on your partner passon he said softly
though passon couldnt hear

because of the comparative ease
with which hed captured passon
stilman didnt slack up his alertness he
figured hed been lucky if carnes cap-
ture was as easy he wasnt going to be
too proud of the substance of his written
report he could see sergeant raymonds
face with that curled upper lip he could
hear that steely voice ribbing him

  stilman could have shot carne where
he came up on him squatted down
warming his hands at a crackling fire but
the half-breed called indian carne
seemed possessed of an extra sense per-
haps a dry twig had cracked giving him
warning he suddenly whirled and hurled
himself into grips with the corporal

  they dropped together stilman swore

he should have challenged earlier he
had his gun covering the killer now he
was forced to fight with the best he had
but despite his good physical condition
and training carne was doing a lot of
damage it would be some time before
stilman would regain the full vision of his
right eye

  he brought a knee sharply up into his
attackers middle carne rocked back
but recovered lurching forward stil-
man came u to his feet meeting the man
with a savage left hook the half-breed
toppled back his legs wobbly but faced
with capture and the courts he drew the
ugly skinning knife from his belt and
whirled in stilman had holstered his
gun he sidestepped and swung his right
in a looping arc which chopped carne
behind the ear smashing him face down
to the ground

  corporal stilman sucked at a set of
raw knuckles he glared down at the
prone form now he stopped scooped
up a handful of snow and held it to his
damaged eye carne had come within
a lash of gouging him

  soon stilman was herding passon in
from the bush both men were now
squatted before the fire stilman made
a meal and tea and fed them how
many moose did you kill passon the
corporal asked

  whats it matter mountie theyre
no good to us or to you he answered
growling

  why

  we couldnt get them out we were
foolish to head in here anyhow boat
engine petered out up the white shes
lost her main gear babbitt anyhow
shes leakin bad and wouldnt carry us
three an the meat what makes you so
interested in the meat anyhow aint you
satisfied with us

  stilman grinned just had an idea
that frank masons indians down at the
post might welcome such a big kill the
corporal said now carne youll go to
work an dress the meat out and re-
member this now ive got you both to-
gether so i can shoot i wont be fooling
hangnoose babbitt

you have it always like to take your
kind in on the hoof but theres no rule
in our book says we cant shoot-in self
defense you try any monkey business
with that skinning knife and- stilman
broke off patting his gun

very early the following morning
there was a leering grin on passons
face as he watched the corporal stride
back from the creek

  stilmans wide grin stopped the big
man

  yeah thats right passon you were
right too the babbitt in the main gear
is lost but i have an idea moose leg
bone is hollow huh well well whittle
ourselves a babbitt a bushing from green
bone well whittle a spare sounds
crazy but ive a hunch itll get us where
i want to take you itll be a new kind
of babbitt all right shall we call it a
hangnoose babbitt

jhsuusl ot srip-cfjrita sd out of dism jaai

 p own at the pitch fork ranch angus peterson and steve ward were
  vainly trying to beat off the attacking outlaws who were known os the
 vultures peterson and ward were swiftly running out of ammunition they
 fired carefully from the windows-trying to moke eoch shot count

 cant keep this up much longer peterson said looks like the vul-
 tures have got us this time

 apparently the outlaws realized that they were winning for they renewed
 the fury of their attack then suddenly out of the night galloped a dark-
 clad figure on a black horse thundering guns bucked and flamed in his
 hands os he dashed into the midst of the attackers disconcerting them by
 the unexpectedness of his charge

 men went down before the death-dealing onslaught of those blozing
 guns then there came the booming of a rifle from nearby as blue hawk
 also went into action with two men dead and three badly wounded the
 vultures decided they had enough

 peterson and his outfit got help shouted the leader of the vultures no telling how many either
 lets get out of here i

 the outlaws begon a hosty retreat-never realizing that the help numbered only two men wayne
 morgan and blue hawk thats the kind of fighting this two-man army does in next issues smashing
 masked rider novel-horsemen of the twisted trails by donald bayne hobart look forward
 tt it-its a humdinger from start to finish

  stilman had been working at the in-
board

 couldve saved yourself a heap of
trouble ifn youd listened to me pas-
son growled i told you the boat was
useless

 which boat do you mean passon
the only boat thats useless as i see it
is my canoe which got stove in in the
night-wind and ice

  the killers exchanged meaning glances
passon then turned to the law man again
mebbe you can pull rabbits out of a
hat huh he said sneering

  not rabbits passon-babbitts

 you mean you think you can-

  both prisoners watched closely as with
great patience the corporal whittled out
a ring of green moose leg bone he made
several trips to and from the boat now
as he returned a smile of satisfaction
curled his mouth comers

  thats it boys he said i got the
idea harking to a time when as a young-
ster i replaced a bushing in a disc har-
row but ive got another idea you
carne can go to work an strip some
babiche out well sew those moosehides
around the stove-in canoe with the sinew
and load the meat aboard then well tow
the outfit however queer it might seem
up to the post
	masked rider western

  by mid afternoon corporal stilman
directed his prisoners to their positions
in the big boat shoved off and climbed
aboard

  you break ice with that pole passon
he cnpef out but dont forget what the
poles for he touched his holster sig-
nificantly started the engine and grinned
wide as it exploded into action

  nothing much wrong with her he
yelled just needed a new babbitt now
settle down an dont try any tricks

  stilman settled himself down he
grinned wide as he cast a glance back at
the cumbersome looking skin-covered
boat in tow then he shrugged filled and
lit his pipe

a pale sunset greeted the arrival of
the strange-looking outfit at the
post wharf heavy ice had done further
damage to the big boat which leaked
badly carne had been forced to bale con-
tinously

  stilman glanced up smiling as wildly
gesticulating indians and their squaws
hurried down from the post buildings and
then-his smile faded his jaw set as
he saw sergeant raymond and frank
mason leave the factors house   

  nice work dave they were seated
before a crackling fire in the living room
where stilman had given the sergeant an
oral report

  thanks sarge coming from you that
sounds especially good

  raymond was grinning he was toying
with a thin wafer of bone all that was

left of stilmans improvised babbitt

  you couldnt have gotten much farther
with this dave he said

  stilman fished a hand into his pocket
and pulled out a much thicker heavier
ring of leg bone

  thats what id figured sarge thats
why i whittled out a spare but besides
in a pinch how many such bushings do
you think i could have made from sixteen
moose legs he chuckled softly and
got to his feet

 mason the factor had entered and
through the open doorway there came
sounds of wild yelling

 stilman and raymond whirled brows
elevated but mason reassured them

  its just the boys and the squaws cele-
brating he said with a light chuckle
youre quite a hero dave the squaws
cut the babiche stitching on that crazy
canoe covering theyll have enough
hides for moccasins for everyone and
a few pairs left over for sale i wouldnt
be at all surprised if you got a specially
trimmed pair or two for yourself it
wouldnt surprise me either if one of the
young squaws wanted to marry you 

  dave stilman blushed and made a thick
throat sound

  there was a knock on an inner door
a young squaw entered carrying food
and shortly dave stilman was doing full
justice to thick juicy young moose steak
all he wanted for the next forty-eight
hours was food and sleep and then more
of each

work

with

by jack benton

it was a strange night-dark and
dismal with a hint of menace in the
hush that hung over everything
uneasiness was strong within bruce fos-
ter as he rode into the rafter m ranch
yard holding his roan to a walk

  funny foster muttered seems like
there might be something wrong here
a soft breeze seemed to blow his words
back against his face and he grew more
and more conscious of the silence the
light gleaming through the open windows
and door of the bunkhouse were welcom-
ing beacons in the gloom but there were
no voices coming from inside no figures
moving about as there should be at this
time of night

  fosters gaze searched the shadows
seeking and finding familiar objects as a
man will when he returns home after hav-
ing been away for nearly three months
the ranchhouse up on the hill appeared
deserted there were no lights in the

windows and the front door was closed

  the roan headed toward the cavvy cor-
ral beyond the big cook shack for the
horse also knew that he was home but
foster halted his mount in front of
the bunkhouse he had a feeling that he
might still need the horse tonight so
he wasnt in any hurry to unsaddle and
turn the roan into the corral

  foster slid out of the saddle stiff from
nearly a days riding it had been lonely
coming back from the long trail drive
he had paid off the men who made up the
trail drive crew and left them back there
in rail city winter was coming on and
they wouldnt be needed back here at the
ranch until spring like many outfits the
rafter m worked only a skeleton crew
during the long cold months

  foster stood tall and lean in the shad-
ows as he adjusted the twin belts of the
two guns he wore there was a rugged-
ness and determination about him that

joajtsa of jtha fiagtsa w back a munch jjiih gunplay


	masked rider western

made him considered one of the best trail
bosses in that part of the country at twen-
ty-eight

 he knew how to handle men-to give
them orders and make them stick and to
also do more than his share of the work
that was why howell moore had made
bruce foster foreman of the rafter m
two years ago

  foster wondered where the ranch own-
er was now it wasnt like the old man
to turn in so early unless he was sick-
and yet the ranchhouse was dark foster
stepped up on the small porch that ran
along the front of the bunkhouse leaving
the roan standing ground-hitched

he reached the open door and
then stood staring joe graham the
oldest member of the outfit was lying on
his bunk he had a blanket pulled up over
him so that only his face and gray hair
were visible he glared at foster

  you were a fool to come back here
bruce graham said get out while you
can

  why foster demanded curtly as he
stepped into the big room wheres the
rest of the outfit

 gone said graham things have
changed around here since the old man
died

  since what foster asked dazedly

 since howell moore died graham
said happened about three weeks ago
his horse threw him out on the range
must have hit his head against a rock
when we found him he had been dead for
some time funny thing-just a few days
before he died the boss told me that if
anything happened to him you were to
have his saddle providing you came
back here bruce the saddle with the
silver mounting on it

  it struck foster there was something
strange about the way joe graham re-
mained motionless on the bunk beneath
the blanket only moving his head a little
as he talked

  if moore is dead who is in charge of
the ranch foster asked casually moving
closer to the bunk

  gaddy stanton is boss of this ranch
now graham said he aims to combine
the rafter m with his bar s seeing as thfe
two ranches are right close to each other
stanton exclaimed foster but the
old man hated him like poison they just
never could get along how did he get
this ranch

  i dont know said graham stanton
didnt tell me ive already been too curi-
ous

  foster swiftly reached out and pulled
back the blanket that covered the old
waddy he blinked as he saw that joe
grahams hands and feet were so tightly
tied that he couldnt move

  didnt want you to know about this t
bruce graham said stanton and that
gunslick of his mike harlan are here and
theyve been holding me a prisoner like
i said ive been too curious they fired
me with the rest of the old outfit i
sneaked back here and was looking
around tonight when those two sidewind-
ers caught me and tied me up

  why didnt you tell me they are hold-
ing you a prisoner foster demanded as
he reached into a pocket of his levis and
drew out a jackknife ill have you free
in a hurry joe

  i figured if you didnt know i was a
prisoner you might leave pronto bruce
graham said stanton and harlan are
waiting for you to get back theyre sure
that youre carrying the money you got
for the sale of that rafter m trail herd
and they want that dinero theyll down
you to get it too

  foster quickly cut the ropes that bound
grahams wrists and ankles the old
waddys gun had been taken from him
but foster found a fully loaded colt in a
holster hanging from a gunbelt on a peg
on the wall he handed the gun to gra-
ham and also the cartridge belt

  keep this and stay under the blanket
like you are still tied up foster said
im getting out of here-but ill be
around right close i have a feeling that
stanton and harlan are sure in for a sur-
prise or two

  ive got the same feeling said gra-
good man to work with	

ham with a grin if they try getting
tough with me again ill sure plug the
both of them

  foster put away his jackknife and drew
his right hand gun as he headed for the
door of the bunkhouse he was ready for
trouble when it came as he stepped-out-
side he heard voices coming from the di-
rection of the cook shack he realized
that if he went down the steps at the cor-
ner of the building he would be spotted by
stanton and harlan

  dont want them to see me yet he
muttered

  he vaulted lightly over the porch rail
and landed on the ground in front of the
bunkhouse he quickly swung into the
saddle and rode away keeping the bunk-
house between him and the cook shack so
he could not be seen

  foster had no intention of going far or
leaving joe graham at the ranch alone
he rode on until he reached a clump of
trees and then halted the roan and swung
out of the saddle

  sorry horse he said reckon you
are tired of carrying me around but im
hoping you will get a rest from now on

  he left the horse ground-hitched he
had watered the roan at a creek a mile
from the ranch and let the animal rest
quite a few times during the long days
ride

foster headed back toward the
ranch buildings moving silently and
keeping in the shadows as much as pos-
sible he saw no sign of stanton and har-
lan but suspected they might be in the
bunkhouse with joe graham

 howell moore had been a bachelor
with no living relatives so there was no
one to inherit the rafter m so far as fos-
ter knew he wondered why the old
man had left him the silver mounted sad-
dle not that he had any objections to the
gift he had always admired it moore
thought so much of the saddle that he had
always kept it in the ranchhouse living
room save on the rare occasions that he
used it

  foster suddenly had a hunch that the

saddle might be vitally important moore
had been careful to tell graham that fos-
ter was to have the saddle if anything
should happen to the ranch owner it al-
most seemed that moore had known he
was going to die soon it was the sort of
knowledge that a man would possess only
if his life had been threatened

  maybe the boss didnt die from an ac-
cident after all foster muttered as the
thought struck him i want to get a look
at that saddle in a hurry

  he swiftly made his way to the ranch-
house it was still dark and apparently
deserted he found the closed front door
was not locked so he opened it and
stepped into the hall he closed the door
and made his way through the darkness
to the living room

  foster knew that the windows of the
living room could not be seen from the
bunkhouse so he decided to risk lighting
an oil lamp after drawing down the
shades at the windows he kept the lamp
turned low-but there was enough light
for him to see fairly well

  the silver mounted saddle rested on a
rack that moore had built for it against
one wall of the room foster walked over
and examined the saddle it was a beauti-
ful job that combined a hand scrolled
polished tan border against a background
of deep rich mahogany there was also
a lot of silver on the hull

  foster lifted one of the fenders and
looked underneath his eyes narrowed as
he read what howell moore had written
there

  dont try stealing that saddle foster
said a cold voice behind him it is part
of the rafter m property and i own this
spread now

  foster swung around to find that gabby
stanton and mike harlan stood in the
doorway of the living room covering him
with their guns stanton was a lean
hawk-faced man with a black mustache
harlan was heavy-set and looked like a
gorilla in range clothes

  i wasnt trying to steal the saddle
foster said quietly just looking at it
seems like there have been some changes
	masked rider western

around here since ive been away what
happened to howell moore

  he died stanton said curtly since
moore left no will and he owed me five
thousand dollars i took over this ranch as
payment of the debt since that herd you
sold in rail city were part of the rafter
m stock they were my property so ill take
the money you got for the sale foster
no you wont snapped foster in
the first place i dont believe that moore
ever owed you any five thousand dollars
youre the last man in the world the boss
would ever borrow money from im
plumb certain of that

  aw why bother arguing with this
hombre boss growled harlan lets
plug him and get it over with no one
will ever know what happened tg him if
we get rid of the body

  thats where youre wrong foster
said deciding to play a bluff for all it was
worth i stopped off in the nearest town
on my way here had a little talk with
sheriff carter told him that i was head-
ing for the rafter m to turn over the
money i got for the trail herd to the boss
the sheriff told me that howell moore had
been found dead furthermore carter
doesnt think it was an accident that
killed my boss

  what makes sheriff carter think there
is anything suspicious about moores
death stanton demanded moore was
thrown from his horse and knocked un-
conscious he died from the blow on the
head

  thats right said harlan he glared
at foster then his lips curled in a cruel
smile he died from a blow on the head
my blow i killed him but knowing it
wont do you any good foster because
in a moment or two im going to shoot you
in two with this gun

the trail boss stared at the two men
for a moment

  so you did murder howell moore
said foster i figured that might be it
and im willing to bet that you forged
some sort of a paper to prove that moore
owed you five thousand dollars

  what if i did said stanton moores
lawyer in black rock admitted the note
signed by moore looked all right to him
and agreed that i could take over this
ranch for the five thousand owed me i
told you there is no will

  thats where you are wrong foster
said moore did leave a will and in it he
made joe graham and me joint owners of
this spread

  youre crazy snapped stanton do
you think i would believe a wild yam like
that show me that will

  all right said foster

  he turned and reached for the silver
mounted saddle and took it down off the
rack stanton and harlan stepped closer
still covering foster with their guns 
moores will is written on the under-
neath side of one of the fenders on this
saddle foster said right here

  lets see stanton said

  as stanton moved closer foster gave
the saddle a quick heave it struck the
ranch owner with such force that it
knocked him to the floor jarring his gun
out of his hand harlan cursed and fired
a wild shot that missed the rafter m fore-
mans head by at least a foot

  fosters hands flashed to his guns and
they came up roaring he put a bullet in
harlans right shoulder the heavy-set
man howled in pain and dropped his gun
fosters second shot into the floor made
stanton give up any further idea of trying
to grab up his gun

  busy little bee arent you bruce
said joe graham as he stepped into the
room with a gun in his hand behind the
old waddy was a lean gray haired man
with a sheriffs star pinned to his vest
me and sheriff carter have been listen-
ing out in the hall and we sure found the
conversation right interesting

  we certainly did said the sheriff
you made a good guess when you told
these two that i thought there was some-
thing suspicious about howell moores
death i did-and i rode out here to the
rafter m tonight to question stanton
about it

  looks like you arrived at just the
good man to

right time sheriff said foster reckon
you heard harlan say that he killed
moore with a blow

  i did said the sheriff as stanton
scrambled to his feet and im arresting
stanton and harlan on a charge of mur-
der

  you sure did some good talking
bruce said graham these two didnt
even know that i was untied when they
found me out in the bunkhouse still lying
under the blanket so they left me there
the old waddy shook his head sadly
kind of wish that the old man had left
us this spread in his will

  he did said foster i was telling the

work with	

truth when i said that moore wrote his
will on the underneath of the saddle
fender foster reached down and turned
back the saddle fender so that all the men
could see what was written there hera
it is

  youre right said the sheriff as he
read what the owner of the rafter m had
written and i reckon this is legal too

  graham stood covering the two prison-
ers with his gun but he was smiling
happily

  always said howell moore was a good
man to work for at all times graham
and im plumb certain bruce foster will
be a good man to work with from now on

chapter i enemy country

at sunset jim dulane stood beside the water-
ing trough in vistaville letting his tired pony
drink with fists planted on his hips and shoul-
ders hunched he looked half asleep in reality he was
a novelet by johnston mcculley
branded as the son of an outlaw jim dulane

alert on guard he was in enemy country
here no welcoming hand would be ex-
tended to him though he had been born
in this little arizona cowtown and his
family name was well known too well
known to men of this range the name of
dulane was as a red rag to a belligerent
bull

  jim dulane had expected to find a
sleepy little cowtown instead he had
found a scene of bustling activity men
were hurrying along the street cow
ponies lined the hitch-rails the cattle
loading pens down by the railroad spur
were choked with bawling steers the san
juan rancho was shipping a beef herd

  when his pony had finished drinking
jim dulane remained afoot and led him
the short distance to the public stable he
swung along with an easy stride-a lean
tall athletic hombre of twenty-five whose
pony garb and gear indicated consider-
able cowboy prosperity

  his general appearance was that of a
jovial devil-may-care young range rider
except for his face that did not blend in
with the rest of him the eyes were not
twinkling merrily at life and the lips did
not smile his countenance was set with
the rigidity of determination

  ben lenwright the stable owner was
sitting out in front with old ed shaw the
towns professional loafer jim dulane
stopped in front of them and lenwright
got up

  i want you to stable my pony and take
good care of him jim dulane said take
care of my blanket-roll too

  sure lenwright answered as they
went inside with the pony your face
seems familiar to me stranger have i ever
seen you before

  mebbe when i was a baby yuh prob-
ably knew my father folks say i favor
him a lot he was called fox dulane

  jim dulane eyed the stableman as he
spoke he seemed to expect a reply he
would be forced to resent

  lenwright gulped fox dulane oh

  yeah i knew him before-

  before he took to the hills with my
uncle and turned outlaw jim dulane
asked as the other man hesitated that
happened when i was a baby right after
my mother died they sent me to my
mothers sister and she raised me

  and here you are back in vistaville
yeah here i am jim dulane agreed
laconically

lenwright spat tobacco juice into
the straw and squinted

  if youve come for the reason i think
lad mebbe youve picked a bad time he
said the san juan outfit is in town
shippin and sam warren the san juans
boss is here with his men

  im glad to learn that i aim to to meet
up with sam warren as soon as possible
listening outside the stable door ed
shaw heard this conversation without
waiting to hear more he scurried off down
the street to the saloon he had news to
impart and it should be worth a few free
drinks

  the son of fox dulane was in town
and looking for sam warren to men of
the vistaville range that would have only
one meaning after the passing of years
fox dulanes son had returned

  sam warren had led the posse which
had finished the dulane gang george
dulane the younger brother had been
killed fox dulane had been wounded
captured and sent to prison for forty
years that had been twenty-five years
ago now fox dulanes son grown to
manhood had returned to look up war-
ren that probably meant he was back to
avenge his father and uncle

  lad i reckon i know whats in your
mind lenwright was saying but you
want to see reason youd never get a fair
chance at sam warren hes got some bad
hombres workin for him his foreman
cliff kinsey is downright mean then
theres lew brease a sort of human
snake
fights to save his family name from dishonor

  sounds like a hard outfit jim dulane
commented

 the san juan dont run to angels-
unless its warrens daughter bessie if
you start a war boy youll have big odds
agin you

  so you think i shouldnt bother sam
warren jim dulane asked grimly my
uncle was killed by his punchers war-
rens testimony sent my father to prison
dad died in prison about a month ago i
was with him when he died he wanted
the books balanced for the dulanes and
ive come to balance em without say-
ing more jim
dulane turned
and went out
into the street
dusk had come
lights were
burning in the
buildings du-
lane strode
along the walk
and from the
way passersby glanced at him he guessed
his identity was already known

  he entered a little restaurant and sat at
a table with his back to the wall where he
could watch both front and rear doors and
look through the window at those who
passed in the street nobody else was in
the place the restaurant man came from
the kitchen and blinked rapidly when he
saw his customer he took dulanes order
and shuffled away

  dulane did some thinking as he waited
he was remembering fragments of what
his father had said

  one man felipe alvarez was as faith-
ful as a dog he saved my life twice he
wasnt caught cause he was away when
the posse jumped us and nobody ever
suspected him if you meet felipe al-
varez son do anything you can for him
jim dulane had promised that along
with other things he considered it a
sacred duty if he ever had the opportu-

nity to befriend the man who had saved
his fathers life

  the restaurant man brought food and
jim dulane wolfed it down he leaned
back in his chair to roll a cigarette the
restaurant man shuffled to the table to get
the dishes

  youre jim dulane i reckon he said
i knew fox-and liked him when
youre ready to leave go through the back
door and into the kitchen somebodys
waitin out there to see you-a girl
dulane glanced up suspiciously i dont
know any girl hereabouts

  youve never met this one she knows
you by sight-had you pointed out to her
as you was walkin down the street and
followed says shes got a message for
you

  aint expectin any message grunted
dulane who is she

  shes dorotea alvarez a nice mexican
girl who keeps house for her father hes
felipe alvarez

  dulane drew in his breath sharply then
relaxed and lit his cigarette he knew the
restaurant man was watching to see how
he reacted to mention of the name i
dont know any felipe alvarez dulane
said must be a mistake but ill see the
girl and learn what she wants

the restaurant man disappeared into
the kitchen after a brief time dulane
got up and sauntered to the kitchen door
as he pushed the door open he was pre-
pared for any emergency

  the restaurant man was stolidly wash-
ing dishes shades were drawn at the
windows and the outside door was closed
a mexican girl was there jim dulane saw
she was pretty and neatly dressed

  you want to see me senorita he
asked

  my father wishes to see you senor
dulane he is felipe alvarez

  why didnt he come himself

  he thinks it best nobody knows you
meet senor i am to take you to our
masked rider western



house it is only a short distance

  i dont know what this is all about
but ill go along with you and find out
dulane decided

  the girl pulled the door open and
dulane strode out with her he was pre-
pared to go into action immediately but
no attack came out of the night dorotea
alvarez grasped his left hand whispered
for him to be quiet and led him away from
the building

  dulane did not relax vigilance an in-
stant this might be a trap of the san juan
men they knew he was in town and he
had only the word of the restaurant man
and this girl that she was dorotea al-
varez

  they went up a rocky slope toward
some scattered adobe huts and stopped
before one in which no light gleamed the
girl knocked in a peculiar manner dulane
heard hinges creak as the door was
opened still clutching his hand the girl
pulled him into the building

  dorotea a hoarse voice whispered
go outside and close the door before i
make a light and watch carefully

  the girl released dulanes hand and he
felt her brush past him in the darkness
heard the hinges creak again as the door
was closed somebody moved near him in
the dark room he could hear a man
breathing heavily a match flared and was
touched to a candle

chapter ii

san juan men

hen dulane got his first
glimpse of felipe alvarez
who had ridden the hills with
his father he saw a middle-
aged swarthy man whose
dark eyes gleamed with un-
dimmed spirit and fire

  the very picture of fox
dulane when he was young alvarez
said id have known you anywhere
senor for his son that the son of fox
dulane should be in my house-it is an
honor

  glad to meet up with you alvarez
dulane said noncommittally

  how i have waited for this moment
always i have told myself another dulane
would come some day news of your
fathers death caused me grief but when
i heard of it i told myself now he will
come the son of fox dulane 

  im here dulane remarked laconi-
cally

  the waiting has been long but the
time not wasted everything is ready no-
body suspects i rode with fox dulane
when his trial was held i wanted to kill
sam warren in the court room but the
fox did not wish it wait felipe he
whispered to me this is not the time
some day and i understood what he
meant some day the fox would run the
hills again

  never now alvarez hes dead

  the old fox is dead si but he lives
again in his son that you are so like him
is an omen we cannot fail good men
are ready to ride with us now well raid
the san juan wipe out sam warren
you mean you want me to head a band
of outlaws asked dulane incredulously

  what else senor another fox dulane
will ride the hills ill serve you with my
life as i served your father

  dulane got out tobacco and paper and
began making a smoke he had to do some
swift thinking he had promised his father
to befriend felipe alvarez but he had
promised him other things too

  sorry alvarez but i cant fall in with
your plans he said finally soberly

 what is this senor the mexican
was amazed

  i didnt come here to ride the hills
alvarez my father did some thinkin in
prison and he figured that he and my
uncle had blackened the dulane name by
bein outlaws and he made me promise to
whitewash it some

  senor are you trying to tell me you
will not follow in the footsteps of your
father alvarez asked

  i reckon im tellin you just that
alvarez

 those who slew your uncle and put
whelp of the fox	

your father in prison are not to be pun-
ished sam warren is to continue to live
and be prosperous ah no senor well
wreck the san juan rancho run off wac-
rens fancy stock burn buildings and hay
poison streams shoot their riders

  that aint to be the way of it alvarez
im saytn that i intend to travel the
straight road

  will men let you senor here where
fox dulane was so well known they will
say you are a whelp of the fox and have
outlaw blood you must be jesting senor
or perhaps it is that you do not quite
trust me

  i trust you alvarez but i reckon wed
better forget this talk and youd better
be a good hombre and forget your outlaw
plans youll live longer and die happier
so alvarez got to his feet eyes
aflame you son of the fox will not ride
the hills and avenge him perhaps you are
afraid to play the game senor you look
like the fox and speak with his voice but
perhaps you are but a shell of a man
senor

  thats enough dulane snapped cool
off alvarez im your friend and ill help
you whenever i can but were not goin
into the outlaw business

  dulane stepped to the door but al-
varez sprang ahead of him and jerked the
door open

  go senor he said i do not give up
hope you will come to your senses when
you are really the son of the fox well
talk again

  as dulane stepped outside and the door
was slammed shut behind him dorotea
alvarez came out of the darkness and
stood at his side

  i heard everything senor she said
all my life i have been taught that a
dulane is some sort of god but now why
speak of it senor one does not argue
with a child about the affairs of men are
you not afraid in the dark her voice
was heavy with scorn

  dulane walked away from her angrily
and went down the rocky slope toward
the street the scorn in the girls voice
had stung him

sounds of merrymaking came from
the saloon and san juan cowboys
were prowling around the street when he
reached it men eyed him as he went along
the walk

  as he passed a store two men left a
group and fell in behind him but kept
pace before he could decide what move
to make two more stepped up one on
either side of him he felt a gun muzzle
press against the middle of his back

  keep walkin dulane a man behind
him ordered

  swift glances at the men on either side
revealed to dulane that they had hands on
holsters and were ready to whip out guns
it would be foolish to put up a fight these
were san juan men and he was the son
of fox dulane the first move he made
would be an excuse for them to do as
they pleased with him

  straight ahead dulane keep walkin

  their boots thumped the walk other
men glanced at the marching group and
looked quickly away

  turn to the right here

  they thrust him into a dark space be-
tween two buildings and closed in on him
one jerked his gun from its holster he
decided this was the time for defense he
tore away from them and got his back
against a building knocked one man
asprawl

  they rushed him bore him down threw
him to the ground and held him helpless
his arms were bent behind him his wrists
tied with a piece of lariat they jerked
him to his feet

  its a good thing for you dulane that
we dont want you mussed up yet one
said were san juan men im lew
brease were interested in your visit
here

  is it any of your business dulane
asked

  you said at the stable that youd come
to see sam warren were takin you to
him

  then this ruckus is for nothin du-
lane said i was startin out to locate
warren since theres four of you and
yuhve taken my gun and tied my wrists
	masked rider western

mebbe its safe for you to take me to him
now

  none of your lip brease warned

  they seized his arms and hurried him
around to the back of the building and
toward the san juan campfire

  weve got dulane one of his captors
called

  the men around the fire sprang up and
stood waiting dulanes captors thrust him
into the circle of firelight he saw a couple
of small tents pitched close together off
to one side the flap of one was tossed
back and two men emerged

  one was tall massive silver-haired and
dulane guessed he was sam warren the
other man answered the description the
stableman had given of cliff kinsey
the san juan foreman

  heres your man mr warren lew
brease reported

  warren strode closer his face was as
inscrutable as dulanes so they faced each
other-the son of fox dulane and the man
who had run down the fox and sent him
to prison

  untie his wrists warren ordered
give him back his gun brease am i so
old and feeble that youve got to bring him
to me bound and disarmed

  a man untied dulanes wrists brease
handed him his gun which he silently
inspected and slipped into his holster

  you neednt be afraid ill start shoot-
in dulane said i aint a murderer

  i wasnt afraid of your father and im
not afraid of his son warren answered
gravely

  didnt have an idea you were i came
to vistaville to see you got some things
to tell you but id rather not tell em to
the whole world

  well step into my tent dulane in-
vited warren you can talk there

  id be careful boss the man standing
beside warren cautioned hes got his
gun now

  get it into your head kinsey that im
not afraid of this man dulane warren
interrupted you can come along to see
im not shot down you other men scat-
ter

warrfn turned his back deliber-
ately and walked into the tent
dulane followed the watchful kinsey
close behind him

  well dulane warren asked when
they were inside

  my father died about a month ago
dulane said i was with him he made
me promise to look you up

  and shoot me warren asked smiling
thinly

  nope you aint got the right of it my
father ordered me to tell you he realized
hed done wrong he said he and my uncle
had blackened the dulane name and he
wanted it cleaned up some i promised to
do certain things

  what did you promise that concerns
me warren asked

  he told me to come to the vistaville
range get a job and spend my life livin
honest to show a dulane could do it
here where his gang raided and
rustled stock

  yeah and he made me promise that
id try first to get a job with the san
juan

  with my outfit warren exclaimed
astounded every day youd be remem-
berin that the san juan men ran down
your fathers gang the mend make your
life miserable theyd even make the
bunkhouse too hot for you

  im expectin that cant you see thats
what my father wanted if i could keep
my feet in the face of that-

  thin yarn kinsey broke in he
wants to join the outfit and be near you
boss and watch for a chance to do devil-
ment hes a dulane-got outlaw blood
what do you want me have the men do
with him

  warren was looking straight at dulane
thats enough kinsey he said no
matter who or what this mans father was
weve nothing against the son

  the flap of the second tent was tossed
back and a girl walked into the fire-
light she was warrens daughter bessie
dressed in mans garb she came to the
door of the conference tent and inspected
dulane swiftly and thoroughly
whelp of the fox

    give him a job dad she said

    that said kinsey grimly is one bad
  mistake

    warren faced him youre a good fore-
  man kinsey but im still boss of the san
  juan he said im hirin this man-usual
  work and wages let the other men know
  were commencin to load in the mornin
  dulane got an outfit

    my pony and blanket-roll im travelin
  light

    save your own pony ill have kinsey
  give you a work string get yore blankets
  and bed down by the fire whatever hap-
  pens remember you asked for it i dont
  promise to nurse you youve got to stand
  on your own feet you may have trouble
  and youll be pretty much of a man if you
  can stand it

    get goin dulane kinsey snapped
  dont hang around and bother mr war-
  ren all night ill give you orders in the
  mornin

  ill be ready to take em dulane said
  he nodded to bessie warren and her
  father turned and walked out of the circle
  of firelight and toward the street to go to
  the stable for his blanket-roll

    see that the man has a decent chance
  warren instructed his foreman if the
  men ride him hell have to take care of
  himself but dont you take advantage of
  your position to do it

    if its a trick of some kind that hes

	plannin-

    sometimes kinsey you talk like youre
  not bright if its a trick and hes plannin
  something which is better-havin him
  prowlin loose around the range or right
  under our eyes where he can be watched

chapter iii

hero stuff

gnored by the others du-
 lane spent the night rolled in
 his blankets near the fire he
 was up before dawn to pull
 on stiff boots shiver in the
 raw morning and go to the
 chuckwagon for coffee a
 surly cook fed him

    kinsey came to him the boss says to



give you a mount take that black pony
ill fix you up with a string later your
job will be at the loadin pens

  the black pony was a vicious-looking
brute saddled and ready he rolled his
eyes as dulane approached dulane war-
ily swung into the saddle and rode with
the others to the loading pens the cars
were ready and the steers in the pens
had been fed and watered

  the men began loading recalcitrant
steers were prodded and shoved and
kicked into the cars when a car was full
it was pinched along the spur and an
empty one put in its place the sun beat
down the dust arose in clouds and men
perspired and growled as they worked

  noon brought a short rest while more
of the beef herd was being driven to the
loading pens warren wanted the job done
by sunset then the men could have their
wild night in town before they returned to
the san juan and routine work

  kinsey bawled orders

  jake colter burns dulane go to the
herd keep em movin to the pens a bunch
at a time brease will show you

  dulane rode toward the herd with the
others he found jake colter-middle-
aged tall thin surly-looking-riding be-
side him

  how do you like the outfit dulane
colter asked

  aint had a chance to get acquainted
dulane replied aint you takin a chance
talkin to me

  colter grinned youll find me as
friendly as i dare be  have you seen
alvarez

dulane glanced at him alvarez
yeah thought he might have told you
a friend of his was workin on the san
juan im the friend a smart trick-you
gettin a job with this outfit

  i aim to make the outfit a good hand
dulane said

  they rode on after the others so jake
colter was a friend of alvarez and a
potential bandit

  brease was acting as assistant foreman
in charge of the herd and gloried in brief
authority he was loud and abusive to the
	masked rider western

men and promptly picked dulane as a
particular object of abuse dulane took it
calmly to outward appearances

  they cut a bunch of steers from the
herd and moved them toward the loading
pens dulane rode on the right of the
bunch they would pass near the camp
he glanced that way and saw bessie war-
ren striding toward her tent from the
chuckwagon

  brease howled an order to colter and
the colter rode at a steer trying to leave
the bunch another pony began acting up
brease went charging at the stock yelling

  the nervous steers broke and scattered
and one went wild dulane saw the be-
ginning of the steers mad flight saw the
crazed animal rushing at bessie warren
as she dismounted

the girl realized her danger and began
running toward her tent the steer
noticed the movement swerved and went
after her with head down charging in a
swirl of dust dulane was the only man
close enough to do any good it was im-
possible to turn the steer and there was
no time to use a rope

  he ripped the black pony with his
rowels and sent him to cut across the
steers path

  bessie warren turned and the steer
turned to follow dulane gripped the reins
in his left hand and rode madly he
yelled at the girl and she waved to show
she understood

  the pony rushed down upon her du-
lane jerked the reins bent from the saddle
put down his right arm and swept bessie
warren off her feet the pony wheeled
sharply because of the extra weight and
the tug dulane gave the reins and the
steer swept past a few feet away shower-
ing them with dust

  with the girl clinging to him dulane
trotted the pony away brease and colter
dashed up with ropes ready

  as they attended to the steer dulane
stopped his pony in front of the tents and
let bessie easily down to her feet

  thanks cowboy-quick thinking she
praised him coolly i hope youll get along

with the outfit jim dulane i believed
what i heard you tell my father last
night dont disappoint me

  she went into her tent dulane wheeled
the pony to help the others get the scat-
tered stock together when the bunch
reached the loading pens kinsey was irate

  take you all day to get a few steers
here he demanded

  wed have got here sooner but we had
to stop and watch dulane play hero
brease sneered a steer broke the bunch
and went wanderin around and dulane
thought he might hurt bessie rode over
and jerked bessie off the ground
what kinsey cried tryin to get in
soft dulane youre here to work not
play hero

  unnoticed sam warren had ridden up
behind them

  thatll do he said in his cold voice
i saw it dulane saved bessie from bein
hurt or killed the other men didnt seem
to know what to do dulane can play hero
like that just as much as he likes get on
with the work

  breases face turned purple with wrath
at dulane as warren rode on the
segundo swung his horse over close to the
black pony

  somethin tells me dulane that the
san juan outfit aint goin to be big enough
for both of us brease said

  at sunset a locomotive chugged up the
branch line the steers had been loaded
and the train was ready to be moved it
rolled away and the san juan men re-
turned to their camp to clean up

  a barrel of water had been hauled from
the well and the men lathered and
scrubbed themselves they put on fresh
shirts and gaudy neckcloths then gathered
around the chuckwagon for food

  the heavy work was done and a night
of play was ahead there was to be a
dance in an empty barn at the end of the
street most of the girls would be mexi-
cans who lived in vistaville who could
and would dance until dawn without ceas-
ing

  dulane went to the stable to see that his
own pony was all right arranging to get
whelp of the fox	

him in the morning as he returned down
the street boots thumped the walk behind
him and felipe alvarez came to his side

   i ask your humble pardon senor for
last night-i should have known that the
son of fox dulane would be clever the
mexican said i see now senor that you
have some clever plan of your own to
get a job with warren was a rare trick
ive got a punchers job with the san
juan-nothin clever about that replied
dulane gravely

   it grieves me senor that you do not
trust me but i am willing to wait

alvarez went on down the street
dulane to the dance frowning
thoughtfully he entered the barn and
stood just inside the door

   the girls were dancing with a frequent
change of partners he saw bessie warren
talking to her father she was not in
mannish attire now but wore a white
dress

   dulane was ignored the girls who met
his glance looked away quickly he re-
ceived no unspoken invitation to cut in
jake colter stopped behind him

  grab yourself a gal colter said
theyre kind of scarce but itll be easier
to get one when some of these hombres
get thirsty and head for the saloon
yeah dulane agreed

  speakin of saloons lew brease has
 been doin some drinkin already and hes
uglier than usual went on colter he
blames you for the dressin down warren
gave him warren ordered kinsey to lay
off you so kinseys got to do it but
brease is kinseys pal and kinsey is
proddin him to go after you

  why dulane asked

  kinsey dont like you the old man
took you on agin his advice and bessies
been sayin youre a hero and she likes
you a heap kinsey dont want her to like
any man but him

   colter left to pursue a girl and dulane

 three novels in every issue of

 triple western

now on sale c at all stands

glanced around the room he saw kinsey
glaring at him brease was standing be-
side kinsey the other men were watch-
ing the dancing and waiting for partners

  no fun for him here dulane decided
he did not want to stand there and be the
object of curious stares he turned to
leave but somebody touched his arm
bessie warren was beside him

  youre not dancing she asked why
not dance with me

  she was merely being kind dulane
thought she was causing him trouble
without knowing it if he danced with
her kinsey would be infuriated more
but he could not refuse

  i saw you standing there looking lone-
some she said as they began dancing
the other girls were afraid to dance with
you but theyll not be afraid now they
think what i do is right for them to do
also

  the music stopped and dulane left
bessie warren beside her father after
thanking her for the dance he went
toward the door

  some of the other girls were smiling
at him now dorotea alvarez brushed
against him

  claim me for a dance senor quickly
she whispered

  dulane smiled and spoke to her as
though for the first time in his life and
swept her out on the floor as they danced
her lips were close to his ear

  forgive me for what i said last night
she begged i did not understand and
be on your guard i have overheard talk
beware of lew brease

  before dulane could reply another man
claimed her dulane drifted over to the
wall and went to the door he got his hat
and gunbelt from the peg where he had
left them went out and strolled up the
street

  on impulse he took his gun from its
holster to examine it he drew in his
breath sharply when he found the weapon
empty somebody had emptied it while he
had been dancing no doubt that some-
body would try to pick a quarrel later and
dulane with an empty gun would have
no chance if it came to serious trouble

chapter iv

grudge fight

  a ksulane filled the gun with

   j  cartridges from his belt and
v	returned it to its holster he

i	ft strode into the saloon to find

f a l only a couple of townsmen
vliisffil	silently a bartender

notjsjmr served him dulane took his
drink and began building a

cigarette

  this place looks like itd been here
some time he said glancing around curi-
ously

   yeah one of the first buildins here-
abouts the barman replied historic
place see them two holes in the wall
old bullet holes the dulane gang raided
the town and held up the saloon one of
the san juan punchers acted hostile and
fox dulane put a couple of bullets past
his ear and into the wall folks say youre
dulanes son and workin for the san
juan thats funny

   dulanes eyes glinted do you feel like
laughin about it he asked

  the bartender gulped and backed away
shaking his head hastily dulane lit the
cigarette he had made boots thumped
the floor as somebody turned in from the
street dulane looked around to see lew
brease and two other san juan men
walking toward him

  i want to see you dulane lew
brease said

  dulane saw brease had been drinking
enough to make him dangerous but not
enough to make him slow and careless

  what do you want to see me about
dulane asked easily

  i told you today the san juan outfit
aint big enough for us both im changin
that and sayin this range aint big enough
either im giving you a chance to git your
pony and ride

   dulane leaned against the bar i see
he said sagely sort of enlargin your ter-
ritory when i dont put up a holler eh
what makes you so anxious to see me
leave

  we dont want you around this range
aint kind to outlaws and youre a dulane
if you dont like what im sayin youre
wearin a gun but mebbe its only an
ornament mebbe you aint like the rest of
the dulanes

  youre sure tryin to git me to fight
dulane reflected aloud you talk like a
man full of confidence brease youre
tryin to taunt me into drawin and youve
got reason to believe im good with a gun
you aint even standin ready to draw
quick while you make war talk

  ill draw quick enough if theres need
growled brease

  mebbe youre thinkin that soon as i go
for my gun youll have a right to go for
yours you must have an idea a quifck
draw wouldnt do me any good mebbe
you think my gun aint loaded dulane
went on softly its always loaded brease
if i put it aside a minute i always take
a look when i buckle it on again took
a look after i left the dance somebody
had taken the cartridges out of my gun
but i put more in shes ready for work
now

  the expression in breases face told
dulane he had guessed the truth brease
had known the shells had been taken out
of the gun now knowing the gun was
loaded again brease had a moment of
terror he was not particularly fast or
accurate with a gun and the dulane
tradition indicated that the man before
him would be lightning fast

  you still demandin i leave the coun-
try dulane asked gently

  i am with others listening brease
had to make a stand ill give you till
sunrise

  brease turned hastily toward the door
but dulane stopped him

  wait might as well settle this now
brease i aint lettin you leave here to go
away and think up some new trick this
is a showdown im stayin on the san
juan as long as mr warren lets me
theres your answer and you dont have
to wait till sunrise for it the next moves
up to you

  ill see you at sunrise brease said
whelp of the fox	

doggedly and started out again

  stop dulanes gun was in his hand
and steel was in his voice back up to the
bar take your gun out and drop it on the
floor if you feel like tryin to shoot go
ahead

brease backed to the bar his hand
gripped the butt of his gun dulane
stood ready waiting but brease did not
try to fire he drew out his gun slowly and
dropped it at his feet

  brease youre standin in line with a
certain pair of holes in the wall dulane
said im goin to put a couple of new
holes there by sendin bullets past your
head dont move brease unless youre
sure lead will richochet off your skull

  youre aimin to murder me brease
cried

  dulanes gun cracked and a bullet thud-
ded into the wall brease felt the hot
breath of its passing his eyes bulged and
perspiration broke out on his face du-
lanes gun spoke again and again a bullet
thudded into the wall brease slumped
against the bar as though strength had
left him dulane ejected the spent shells
and reloaded

  im not leavin the vistaville range
brease he said in quiet emphasis if
you try any more tricks such as emptyin
my gun and tryin to make me draw ill
look you up and ill be right interested in
whether hot lead will bounce off of your
topknot myself pick up yore gun

  brease stooped and picked the weapon
up slipped it into his holster some of the
men watching in the doorway stepped
aside as sam warren strode into the
saloon

  ive been watchin this warren said
did you take the cartridges out of du-
lanes gun brease

 just playin a joke on a new man
brease muttered

  it wasnt a joke but an attempt at mur-
der if theres fightin among san juan
men its got to be fair remember that
brease get back to camp and stay there
the rest of the evenin youve been
drinkin too much

  at dawn the san juan outfit moved out

of town it was only five miles to the
ranch during the trip dulane found the
men with the exception of jake colter
avoiding him

  keep your eyes open colter warned
everybody knows how you handled
brease the men know brease is kinseys
pal and theyll be agin you to curry favor
with the foreman

  for a few days dulane worked at ordi-
nary ranch chores brease kept his dis-
tance but everybody seemed to be in a
conspiracy to make dulanes life miser-
able

  work was heaped on him the most dis-
agreeable tasks in the bunkhouse men
made remarks intended to infuriate him
so two weeks passed dulanes pride was
being outraged and his spirit crushed

  one evening colter got him alone col-
ter had been to town for the ranch mail

  alvarez and the others are gettin tired
of waitin colter said they want to
know when youre goin to make a move
how long are you goin to stand the treat-
ment youre getting the fox wouldnt
have stood it alvarez cant be held back
and kinseys plannin somethin new agin
you you aint breakin down fast enough
to suit him

  im not intendin to make any move
dulane replied tersely no use talkin
about it colter you might just as well
get this straight now

  dulane realized how alvarez looked at
the situation and knew kinsey was schem-
ing to get him off the ranch this was
the moment of test it would be easy to
rebel take to the hills and become another
fox dulane or he could quit and ride
away go back where he had been reared
and live comfortably among his friends
but that would be admitting he was licked

  as he prepared for the evening meal he
sensed something had been planned the
men were acting strangely he had his
gunbelt on and did not remove it when
the grub call came he went to the cook
shack with the others

  the men were more silent than usual
as they wolfed down their food when
they had finished they remained at the
tables
masked rider western



  mr kinsey one called a burly ruffian
with a squint

  well kinsey asked

 the men have asked me to be their
spokesman we dont want this man du-
lane workin with us hes got outlaw
blood we dont want to work and eat with
him and sleep in the same bunkhouse
with him we want you to ask mr warren
to let him go

 mr warren hired dulane kinsey
said ill tell mr warren what youve
said

  dulane got to his feet this scene aint
foolin me a mite he said this is your
doin kinsey you dont like me and
dont like the way i handled your friend
brease you put the men up to this if
you want to make war on me why dont
you come out in the open to do it

  youre talkin big cause you know mr
warren told me to keep my hands off you
kinsey growled

  he wont object if the troubles per-
sonal youre a bully and a coward kin-
sey

  kinsey and the others sprang to their
feet brease stood to one side he was
wearing his gunbelt and now thinking
to get control of the situation he started
to go for his gun dulanes hand darted
downward and snapped his gun out of its
holster

  hold it brease he warned you aint
got a hand in this well kinsey im
waitin

 the foreman dont fight riffraff
brease roared ill take up his quarrel
can you use your fists

  lets step outside gents dulane said

  he was alert as they went out into the
cleared space in front of the cook shack
where the moonlight was bright he
handed his belt and gun to jake colter as
brease removed his and gave it to one of
the men

krease howled and rushed his first
blow grazed dulanes head and
dulane countered with a blow to breases
face the men formed a circle around
them

  brease spent his strength in wild rushes

and heavy swings dulane evaded the
rushes and kept hammering at breases
face then he began forcing the fighting
he was faster than brease and now
brease began tiring dulane drove him
back toward the circle of men the move
brought brease near the man holding his
gun he whipped the gun from its hol-
ster

  now you outlaw- he cried

  the gun flamed the bullet brushed
dulanes sleeve with a cry of rage du-
lane rushed like a madman he grappled
with brease seized his wrist and jerked
it downward across his knee the bone
snapped brease dropped the gun and
reeled back with a cry of agony

  thats ertough kinsey howled

  enough for me dulane said breath-
ing unevenly serve him right if id
emptied a gun into him though better
take your friend away and get him fixed
up kinsey

  the spectators were silent as dulane
turned to colter got his gunbelt and
buckled it on when he walked alone to
the bunkhouse to bathe his face and hands
the men remained near the cook shack
colter wandered to the bunkhouse and
went inside but appeared at the window
over the wash bench where he could talk
to dulane without being seen

  got enough he asked you carried
that off fine but itll only make em mad-
der goin to keep on with this outfit till
somebody shoots you some day when
youre alone on the range

chapter v

double plot

im dulane saw some of the
men coming toward the bunk-
house and did not want to
meet them then he went to
the pony corral near the
ranchhouse to lean against
the fence and think his- own
pony came up to the bars and
whickered for attention how easy it
would be to saddle and ride back home-
or up into the hills perhaps alvarez was
whelp of the fox	

right and fox dulane should be avenged

  he heard steps behind him and turned
swiftly to find bessie warren approach-
ing he had seen her only a couple of
times since coming to the ranch

  i want to see you jim dulane she
baid i heard what happened at the cook
shack daddy had to set breases arm i
know what youve been going through
youve made a good job of it so far
mebbe it aint much use dulane re-
plied a man cant stand everything

  a real man can endure a lot and i sized
you up for a real man father and i know
whats happening father wont make a
move to help you for it wouldnt be you
making the fight if he did

  boots crunched gravel and kinsey
stepped up

  is this hombre botherin you miss
bessie the foreman asked ran whinin
to you did he get about your business
dulane and dont bother miss warren
again ill take you back to the house
bessie

  she faced him angrily youve been
rather bossy lately she said ive heard
whispers too if you have any ideas about
me cliff kinsey get them out of your
head youre my fathers foreman and
youll never be anything more to me
kinsey turned and walked angrily away
and dulane knew he had a bitter enemy
ih the foreman now

  sent to vistaville on an errand the next
day jake colter saw alvarez

  weve got to force him colter said
hes been treated like a dog and hes
about ready to blow up bessie warrens
gettin soft on him

  ha perhaps he plays a rare game
senor jake alvarez suggested perhaps
he wishes to make sam warrens daughter
fall in love with him then spurn her

  he thinks shes a great gal and its her
treatin him decent that keeps him from
doin what we want if shed turn against
him hed be with us inside ten minutes
perhaps that can be arranged senor
alvarez said softly let us plan

they talked for some time and dorotea
was called into the conference then col-

ter hurried back to the ranch

  kinsey held a conference with brease
that day too

  two things to do-get dulane and get
square with this outfit kinsey said
since theres no chance of me marryin
into a good thing theres no sense in me
hangin around here mebbe we can have
profit and revenge at the same time

  how brease asked looking at his
bandaged arm and cursing

  suppose that small herd near the line
was run into mexico sold and a few of us
split the money and suppose dulane got
blamed for it

  breases face lit up in a malevolent
smile

  work went on as usual for a few days
brease took long rides while his broken
wrist mended and nobody knew where he
went colter got to town for another talk
with alvarez

  then one afternoon as he was mending
a bridle down by the corral dulane saw
a girl gallop up the lane and recognized
her as dorotea alvarez she stopped at
the house and bessie warren came out to
sit on the veranda with her

presently dulane saw the girls
walking toward the corral he
thought bessie warren might want her
pony to ride somewhere and reached for
a rope

  heres a friend to see you bessie
warren said

  oh i had to see you senor jim doro-
tea cried you never come to town to
see me

  why i-why should i dulane stam-
mered

  so thats how it is to be doroteas
eyes flamed you have made a fool of me
senor after that night of the dance i
thought-

  what is all this dulane demanded
he faced bessie warren

  dont ask me bessie warren said
shrugging im not interested in your love
affairs miss alvarez seems to have some
claim on your affections you probably
made love to her

  dulane realized this was a trap a
	masked rider western

scheme to turn bessie warren against him
before he could decide what to say doro-
tea began sobbing violently and turned to
hurry to her pony giving dulane a look
of scorn bessie warren followed

  that evening kinsey issued some or-
ders

  dulane you and colter hit out early in
the mornin in a draw near the line
colter knows where there may be some
strays drive em up if you find any take
a couple of days at it theres a dobe
shack there and you can take supplies
they left shortly after dawn and rode
over rolling rocky hills toward a series of
small canyons

  your father did a lot of ridin here-
about dulane colter said slyly i think
youd be about ready to jump on the san
juan outfit if they treated me as they
do you-

  i asked for it when i took the job
dulane cut him off curtly and promptly

  alvarez thought you took it to get on
the inside and do some plannin warren
thought that too youve been watched
every minute now down here where
were ridin theres a dandy little herd
close to the line on the other side the
crittersd be worth money lets ride up
this canyon

  dulane followed him through a narrow
gap and into a small box canyon and came
to an abrupt stop a small fire was burn-
ing horses were standing around four
men were at the fire and one was alvarez
he grinned at dulane

  we are commencing to carry out plans
senor alvarez said everything is ready
it is time you came to your senses a short
distance from here is some fine san juan
stock and a short distance beyond is the
border our first stroke

  so youre tryin to force me into it
dulane said his anger rising your
daughter cornin to the ranch-

  a trick senor to make senorita bes-
sie think less of you what matters it
have you no spirit is a dulane to let san
juan scum spit on him even now they
try to trap you

  who is-and how

  kinsey and brease have friends below
the line brease has been riding out this
way for several days they plan to run
off the herd and have you blamed for it
kinsey stealin from his own outfit
dulane said hes got a good job

  he expected to marry bessie warren
and has learned he never can so they
will run the herd tonight brease will be
there he will pretend to be spending the
night in vistaville well let them do the
hard work senor and when the herd is
at the line well take it away from them
dulane laughed a fine bunch of plots
two gangs tryin to run off the same herd
and tryin to make it look like my work
kinsey and brease will say your
friends did the rustling perhaps they will
have some sort of proof

  proof dulane understand now why
kinsey had ordered him and colter to
that locality to look for strays the herd
would be run off and kinsey would show
that dulane had been in the vicinity

  we will make fools of them senor
alvarez was saying they steal the herd
then we raid and take it and then senor
we go on with our plans eh

  i wont have anything to do with it
dulane said ill tell warren the truth
about the whole thing and make him
believe me

  so how can you do that senor with-
out exposing me alvarez asked would
you betray your fathers old friend
ill not betray you alvarez but i
wont join you i rode out here with colter
to search for strays come on colter

colter thought he could persuade
dulane when he got him alone he
winked at alvarez spurred his pony and
rode with dulane out of the box canyon
they rode to the dobe shack

  dulane realized his predicament if the
herd was run off he would be blamed no
doubt kinsey had planted evidence he
did not want to betray alvarez but
wanted to protect himself

  they opened the shack cleaned it got
out supplies and built a fire colter busied
himself getting grub and coffee ready
whelp of

dulane was fumbling with a lariat he had
found in the shack colter turned to get
something out of the grub box dulane
whipped out his gun and prodded colter
in the back

  get your hands up he snapped im
takin your gun

  as colter gasped dulane took the gun
and tossed it aside then motioned colter
toward a bunk

  im tyin you up but ill make you
comfortable dulane said he put a noose
over colters wrists jerked it tight if
youve got sense youll say rustlers caught
you and tied you so you couldnt inter-
fere with em ill say i left you behind
when i rode to the ranch ill protect you
and try to save alvarez-this one time
the shadows were beginning to lengthen
as dulane left the shack he rode toward
the ranch keeping in the low places so he
would not be seen dusk came before he
reached the san juan he did not ride
down the lane but dismounted in a dark
spot and went on afoot

  sam warren opened the door when he
knocked

  dont let anybody see me dulane said
quickly ive got somethin to tell you
and nobody must know

  warren looked at him searchingly and
led the way to a small room he used as
an office bessie joined them dulane
spoke rapidly explained that he had dis-
covered the herd was to be run off that
night and that kinsey and brease had
planned it and would try to put the blame
on him

  where did you learn this warren
asked frowning

  i cant tell because ive got to protect
the man who told me dulane said
youve got to believe me and do some-
thin about it why was i sent to look for
strays in that locality wheres lew
brease tonight

  but kinsey my foreman- warren
protested

  i reckon he had some ambitions and
had em smashed

  dad hes telling the truth bessie put
in kinsey had an idea he might marry

the fox	

me and i told him he never would ive
never trusted lew brease but jim dulane
hasnt told all he knows

  i promised my father id come here
and live honest dulane said i also
promised him that if i ever met a certain
man id do anything i could for him
and now youre in a spot where its
hard to live up to both promises
thats it

  tell me something she ordered
when that alvarez girl intimated youd
had a love affair with her did she tell the
truth

  no im swearin it

  so it was a trick to disgust me with
you bessie exclaimed

  never mind that stuff what am i goin
to do about this warren demanded

  turn out the men ride below the
mouth of the canyon and wait there for
the rustlers bessie replied take kinsey
along with you and have a couple of the
men you trust watch him

chapter vi

in ambush

of

farren saw the wisdom
this plan

  the ranch bell pealed
  through the gathering night
  and the men came running
  kinsey with them they
  found warren standing be-
  neath the bell with bessie
  beside him and dulane behind them

  everybody saddle up the white-
haired rancher ordered six-guns and
rifles and plenty of ammunition

  without questioning the men scattered
to get their weapons and catch up mounts

  what are you doin here dulane
kinsey barked i sent you out on the
range

  hes here at my orders kinsey war-
ren said

  wondering kinsey hurried to get his
horse warren quickly took a couple of
trusted old hands into his confidence and
	masked rider western

they kept near the foreman the men
saddled rode to the end of the lane and
waited

  dulane turned his tired pony into the
corral and saddled another he waited at
the corner of the veranda and bessie
warren found him there

  take care of yourself cowboy she
said softly i think i understand some
things now ill be watching for you to
come riding back

  she ran into the house and dulane
mounted and went to join the others his
heart pounding strangely

  ive got a tip theres some rustlin
goin on boys warren said were ridin
to see about it

  they followed the road for a distance
then cut over the hills avoiding the sky-
line for the moon was up kinsey knew
he was under suspicion before they had
ridden far he knew he was being watched
he wondered what had gone wrong

  warren led his cavalcade toward the
border and turned to follow the trail to a
place where the stolen stock would have
to be driven when it emerged from the
canyon they went through a sea of
chaparral and finally warren ordered a
halt

  if the herds stolen and driven out of
the canyon itll have to cross the line
here he said scatter and watch grab
anybody who comes along

  the men sought cover kinsey and
dulane remained near warren two men
kept near kinsey

  mebbe id better see that the men are
posted right kinsey suggested

  you stay here his employer told him
heavily ive been told you and brease
planned this

  what kinsey roared if this outlaw
scum-

  shut up warren snapped if i find
youre innocent kinsey ill do the right
thing by you and do plenty to dulane
you wont have nothin to worry about
thats fair enough

  if brease is up to somethin i dont
know it growled kinsey

  you and brease are bosom friends

when did he start havin secrets from
you warren spoke pointedly

  i aint workin for any man whos sus-
pectin me on the word of an outlaws
son blustered kinsey you can git a
new foreman

  thatll be easy keep your voice
down

  in the chaparral was a sudden commo-
tion men howled guns barked horses
charged through the brush then a bunch
of riders came up through the moonlight

 we caught these hombres ridin
through the brush one of the san juan
men reported

  felipe alvarez and two others were
brought forward

  alvarez and a couple of his mexican 
friends eh warren said what are you
doin around here

  senor warren you will please tell your
men to let us go alvarez replied it is a
free country we were riding to the ford
to cross into mexico to go to a wedding

  youve ridden into somethin warren
told him curtly were waitin for some
rustlers youll wait here till we see what
happens

  alvarez glanced at dulane without rec-
ognition shrugged his shoulders and turn-
ed aside one of the scouts came back
through the brush to warren

  theyre cornin sir he reported

warren gave a quiet order and
everybody mounted kinseys
guards and those watching alvarez and
his friends doubled their caution dulane
realized he was being watched also but
this did not disturb him

  out of the mouth of the canyon a shad-
ow moved a rider came into the moon-
light moved to one side as another rider
appeared then came the herd moving
slowly out of the canyons mouth and into
the moonlight headed toward the rio
grande they would pass the chaparral
patch where the san juan men were hid-
ing

  four men were with the herd they
drove the cattle into a wide lane in the
chaparral squarely between the posted
whelp of

san juan men on either side of the trail
get em warren shouted suddenly

   a shot crashed san juan men were
 suddenly in front of the herd stopping its
 progress others were on either side
 more rode to cut off a retreat

    the rustlers were surrounded

   guns barked and bullets searched
 through the chapparal bending low in
 their saddles the rustlers charged back in
 fright toward the canyons mouth san
 juan men met them with a hail of bullets
 two saddles were emptied a third man
 slipped from saddle to ground as he neared
 the shadows the fourth wheeled his
 horse and charged back to try to get
 through a gun barked and the bullet
 made him swerve his horse despairingly
 he emptied his gun before he toppled
 from his saddle

   round em up warren roared

    some of the san juan men rode to obey
  others went to control the nervous herd
  his face grim warren waited kinsey and
  dulane near him both guarded

   men began reporting

   ones that watson hombre who hangs
 around vistaville-hes dead

   heres another dead one-a mexican
 ive seen around town

two men brought in the third a dis-
charged rider of the san juan badly
wounded more men brought in the fourth
 rustler lew brease brease was badly
wounded but could walk with help

   turned rustler have you brease
 warren asked you can see what its got
 you howd you get into this

   tell me jest one thing-howd you
 know brease asked with a snarl

   things leak out brease it was your
 scheme to get the herd away and put the
 blame on dulane huh

    brease raised his head and saw kinsey
  what are you doin here kinsey he
  cried you brought em huh planned it
  then turned me in

    did kinsey have a hand in this war-
  ren asked sharply

    sure we planned it together

kinsey knew what that meant he
knocked one of his guards aside and

the fox	

sprang into the open his gun blazed and
brease sagged to the ground it barked
again and the bullet missed warren by
inches the third struck dulane high in
the left shoulder

  then other guns blazed and cracked
and kinsey went down

  brease is dead sir a man reported
to warren

 and kinseys riddled warren re-
plied a good cleanup you hurt bad
dulane

  shoulder if i can have it bandaged-
some of you help him warren
directed bring alvarez and his friends
here

  alvarez his eyes bulging was thrust
forward with the two others

 alvarez you see what happens to
rustlers on this range warren said du-
lane is alvarez the man you said you
wouldnt betray

  no sir dulane spoke the truth col-
ter had given him the information first

  dulane tell me the truth about some-
thin warren said you promised yore
father to live honest an honest man cant
make concessions to evil hes honest all
the way or not at all so tell me-did
alvarez ride the hills with fox dulane

wulane straightened this was the
jlf moment of decision he had prom-
ised his father to go straight but had also
promised him to befriend alvarez the
promises conflicted and he had to make a
choice yes alvarez rode with fox du-
lane he said hes the man my father

ville i took him into my outfit and gave

  harsh welcome

curt mason was halfway across
dawns main street when a shout
pulled him around he halted legs
braced wide apart brown eyes reaching
out swiftly toward the darkness his face
was broad and irregular now his mouth
went thin and firm

  he waited tense watchful catching all
the stray noises that pulled at the nights
stillness

 well he asked quietly his eyes

swung around to the batwing doors of the
saloon three men in the doorway looked
on interestedly

  what brought you back to dawn the
voice from the stable demanded

  curt mason stood his ground he felt
the submerged tide of hostility in this
town it surged around him it should
have warned him but something grim
and reckless in his nature held him rooted
where he was waiting for a break in this

mason returns to avenge his drygulched father


	masked rider western

deadly game

  what brought you back to dawn the
voice repeated speak up

  mebbe you can tell me that curt an-
swered dryly

  your old man died with a bullet in
his back five years ago grated the man
hidden in the depths of the stable right
now this town aint needin any masons
so you can clear out and go back where
you came from unless youre hankerin
for a dose of what your old man got

  curts eyelids dropped and his lips
curled away from his mouth in a remote
smile his eyes grew sultry with the wild-
ness that rolled through his lithe muscu-
lar frame

  reckon ill risk it just to get a crack at
the jasper who bushwacked him he an-
swered gruffly

  suddenly curts right hand darted to
his hip he leaped to one side whipping
his gleaming colt a gun barked from the
black stable a bullet furrowed the dust
where he had stood the blasts merged
into one sharp report curt poured three
shots at the orange tongue of flame that
marked the hidden gunmans position

a shrill scream of pain answered
then the soft fall of a heavy body
curt holstered his gun he glanced to-
ward the saloon the three men at the
door lingered there a moment studying
him without hurry curt strode to the
hitch-rack before the low building

  he made no move to enter the stable
no one else stirred in this strangely silent
town voices came from the saloon but
they were a hushed murmur he took his
long deliberate look at the town vaulted
without haste into the saddle of a big bay
stallion wheeling deliberately from the
hitch-rack he jogged down the street

  boots scuffed the saloon steps and
voices charged the air men poured into
the street racing from the stable curt
touched his heels to the bays ribs swift-
ly he swept out of dawn striking for the
western ridge

  ten minutes later he topped a low rise
and looked back toward the blob of lights

that marked the town no sound of pur-
suing hoofs reached him

  his wild reckless mood left him he
pushed on morosely up the narrow trail
that climbed through thick timber wind
washed down from the high ranges and
soughed through the trees memory of
this trail the timber that crowded close
to its edge threatening to overrun it sad-
dened him it had been home

  he knew every trail that threaded the
upper range all this rugged rolling coun-
try with its lush upper pastures boxed in
by the high crags and bluffs of the moun-
tain chain was like an open book to him
here called the thriving cattle where old
tom mason ruled his spread making it
grow beneath his toiling hands

  when cattle began to disappear tom
mason had fought the rustlers he was a
hard man quick with a gun and utterly
fearless there were several small skir-
mishes when the big raid occurred it
took almost every steer tom mason
owned in return he led a handful of his
own riders through the timber in hot pur-
suit

  that was the end of it none of the
riders ever came back later their bod-
ies were found in the scrub-filled bottom
of a canyon high up on the mesa

  curt had wanted to go on that wild night
ride he was nineteen then a fast gun-
hand and old enough to fight rustlers
the elder mason glanced at his wifes
stricken face brusquely he ordered curt
to stay with her curt rebelled but it
did no good tom mason ruled his spread
with an iron hand

  curt stayed-long enough for the grim
ride to the canyon to bring the body of
tom mason back home long enough for
hate to grow in him hate that steeled his
muscles and drove all reason out of him
they still lived those unknown killers re-
sponsible for the mound of earth on the
ridge curt could stand the killing but
tom mason had been shot in the back

  as long as revenge was still to be
achieved curt wanted to stay in dawn
there were no cattle there was nothing
but his hatred but tom masons widow
gunsmoke on the range	

 couldnt bear the sight of dawn with its
 rolling hills its brawling streams its cool
 green grazing lands that was tom ma-
 sons cemetery

   so they went out of dawn traveled be-
 yond the eastern divide to forget what
 could never be forgotten his mother
 lingered for five years before death eased
 her grief there was nothing to hold curt
 after she had passed on he returned to
 dawn for the same job of killing re-
 mained to be done

 curts shoulders came forward he
 thrust aside his somber thoughts
 the stallion carried him out of the timber
 into a meadow which he followed until a
 rising slope took him upland again the
 trail grew rocky sliced through a low wall
 of shale and rock a swift stream tumbled
 along behind a screen of trees its silver
 glitter disappeared beyond a line of bluffs
 that reared dark uneven shapes against
 the night

    curt struck rolling rangeland again he
 pushed the bay to the crest of a brush-
 covered knoll he drifted slowly along
 the rim his eyes studying the valley be-
 low him it lay dark and dim surround-
 ed by a circle of jagged buttes nestling
 close to the ridge the dull gray shape of
 a low ranchhouse cast a black shadow on
 the blacker land

	light flashed in a golden stream from
 a window in the house the glow illu-
 mined part of the rear yard yellowing
 shadowed corrals and a barn shoved back
 against the rising hill

   curt watched the light his irregular
 face a puzzled luminous disk he sat
 loosely in the saddle waiting for familiar
 sounds that could never come there lay
 his home before him

   that jasper in the stable must have
 known i had company waitin for me he
 reasoned mebbe he thought hed give
 me a taste of the kind of welcome waitin
 for me his lips thinned into a humorless
 smile thats fine im in a welcomin
 mood myself

    slipping leather he hitched the stallion
 to a tree he slid cautiously down the

slope catching stunted pines to retard his
progress the light from the house
gleamed bright and close a horse nick-
ered in the corral soundlessly curt
moved to the rear door

  he ducked down skirted the low porch
and flattened out against the wall three
long strides took him to the window a
sweep of his hand removed his broad-
brimmed hat he ventured a quick glance
through the window

  a thick-set broad-shouldered man with
bushy eyebrows and a livid scar running
half across his face sat at a rough table
in the room he was alone

  curt pulled quickly away and raced to
the rear door he peered toward the
corral he could make out two horses
there meaning another man must be
somewhere about his six-gun flashed to
his hand as he stepped to the door it was
open a crack he prodded it gently with
his foot it swung open just enough for
him to step inside nothing happened

  he crouched through the hall it was
dark yet thoroughly familiar at its end
a broad sliver of light carved the darkness
he moved forward another door gave
under his gentle touch the protesting
squeak of a rusty hinge pulled up the
head of the man seated at the table

  you can get out now beall snapped
curt his voice chill and dangerous i
always thought you were crooked find-
in you here on my ranch sort of clinches
the idea

  brad beall looked up into a pair of grim
merciless eyes-eyes that were young but
had seen enough to take the laughter out
of them his right hand crawled furtive-
ly slowly backward

  hold it warned curt his weapon
leveled

  beals thick sensuous lips broke away
from yellowing teeth his face showed no
sign of surprise or shock

  mason your old man was killed buck-
in something that was too big for him

      ow gurt spoke in a soft cold voice

     which is why im back mebbe
you know somethin about that
	masked rider western

  you still have time to get out masons
aint wanted in dawn

  youre the second hombre to tell me
that tonight the other jasper is through
talkin i come back for my ranch so clear
out

  bealls jaw tightened and his lips drew
together

  it was your ranch mason i kinda like
it here myself been using the spread as
an overflow for my steers

  youre gettin out beall and takin
your steers with you this is my ranch
and that means hands off a bunch of
my riders are drivin a big herd in from
across the divide in the mornin youd
better not have any of your cattle around
when they breeze in

  beall sneered his glance moved unin-
terestedly to the door curt wheeled
stepping back the butt of a gun crashed
down grazing his shoulder a lanky man
lost his balance stumbled into the room

  curts six-shooter exploded with a loud
roar a lead slug knocked bealls up-
swinging weapon from his hand it clat-
tered to the floor curts second shot
ripped a shriek from the man by the door
he swayed drunkenly and derricked his
gleaming six-shooter hot lead whistled
past curts face and slogged into the wall
spread-legged curt pumped another shot
from his colt

  the man choked and buckled at the
hips half-bowed he staggered against
the wall and slid down it to the floor

  beall let out an angry bellow and
lunged toward curt the young rancher
swung about his six-gun raised bealls
fist smashed down gnarled fingers
clasped curts gunwrist and twisted hard
caught off guard by the big mans rush
curt dropped the pistol and fell back-
ward

  beall ripped a hard left to the solar
plexus then tore in close with a bull-like
snort curts teeth snapped together with
a sharp cracking sound as bealls head
battered his chin he fought thick arms
that crushed his chest a knee came up
in a swift arc and caught curt in the pit
of the stomach he sagged when beall

split his upper lip with another slashing
blow

  desperately curt squeezed bealls
broad middle they wrestled savagely
against the wall lurched sideways
crashed against the table it overturned
and the two men thumped to the floor
curt bounded quickly to his feet beall
rose ponderously but he grabbed up a
chair and hurled it viciously over curts
bobbing head

  beall charged in close his ugly skull
low again it cracked masons jaws to-
gether fire blinded his eyes he
stumbled backward beall followed up
hammering home a hard blow to the head
pistonlike his knotted fists rammed ciprt
to the wall

  but then beall swung a wild left curt
ducked and slid inside the giants guard
his right hand sank wrist-deep in the soft
midriff beall doubled up in the way of a
pile-driving uppercut there was a sharp
staccato crack like the crisp report of a
rifle bealls huge frame quivered swayed
away from curts hard kunckles all at
once he sprawled face forward to the
floor

  curt wiped his arm across his bleeding
mouth and staggered to the rear door he
looked out over the range then came back
into the room painfully he dragged beall
outside to the yard returned once more
and carried the long-limbed gent to the
saddle of the horse at the corral with a
small coil of rope he lashed the man
across the saddle

  at the watering trough curt filled a
tin bucket and sloshed its contents over
beall the shock of the cold water
brought the burly rancher groggily alive

  curt stared down at him and his voice
ran cold

  ill tell you again beall this is my
ranch get out and stay out

  beall heaved himself to his feet he
strayed drunkenly across to the yard to
his horse standing docilely beside the an-
imal carrying the wounded man some-
how beall lifted himself into the saddle

  savage fury cleared his brain whitened
the scar on his cheek
gunsmoke on the range	

  mason ill see you again when i do
ill kill you dawn aint goin to be big
enough to hold the both of us

  a hard smile across his bleeding mouth
was curts answer he stood in the yard
his legs braced wide apart making cer-
tain that beall leading the other horse
moved off

chapter ii

night raid

    tt ate the next morning curt
          peered across the rolling
          plain dust rolled up a heavy
           cloud and a hot wind from
          the far-off desert beyond the
          buttes whirled it nearer
          with it came the faint bawl-

      - ing of cattle

  curts battered face smoothed to a
smile steers milled toward the meadow
a handful of riders hazed them up the
high pastures enclosed by a rambling
broken line fence

  a light-haired wild-eyed man spurred
his piebald pony away from the range
and approached curt behind him loped
a tall lanky red-headed hombre riding
loosely in the saddle of a sleek roan

  the light-haired chap flung out his arms
in a wide carefree gesture

  there they are curt every last one
of them three thousand head all told
any trouble jed curt asked

  not a bit answered jed lance his
eyes were suddenly serious we did
come across a bunch o riders drivin a
herd of herefords across yore upper
range about two hours back they were
tough lookin coyotes an they were movin
as fast as them steers would go

  the read-headed gent had been staring
at curts puffed lips at the ugly bruise
on his right cheek

  what happened to you he broke in
things are startin ki acknowledged
curt wryly briefly he outlined what
had happened since his return to dawn
concluding with the warning he had issued
to brad beall about removing his cattle

  carrot-topped ki karton whistled the
jasper shore scares easily reckon that
beatin yuh gave him made him think
twice about trying to swipe yore spread

  no responded curt beall aint the
type that scares hes playin a waitin
game shore he took his cattle off my
range but he still wants it i figger hell
wait a few days then drop down and raid
us when he does ill be ready 

  kis lantern-jawed face hardened

  glad ill be around when the shootins
start he said grimly

  you think this polecat beall dry-
gulched your old man jed rasped

  curt stared soberly at him mebbe
im waitin to make sure

  talk was ended abruptly by the other
riders coming in from the range the
men started toward the bunk-house that
stood near the pole corral curt called
them back

  there are only seven of us he stated
simply guess we can all bunk in the
house he turned to a big curly fellow
with large ears that extended away from
his ruddy cheeks chris i reckon yuhre
elected to rustle up grub as usual

  the big fellow grinned and stamped in-
side curt faced his sober-visaged crew

  tomorrow we repair the line fence at
night we split up three of usll ride
herd till midnight the rest ride till
dawn

  the next afternoon while jed ki and
the other mason punchers were out on
the range repairing line fences a high
buckboard wagon rumbled along the curv-
ing road from town it rattled up the
road toward the mason ranch

  curt stood indolently watching the
buckboards steady approach dust flew
up in the wake of creaking wheels and
hung lazily in the windless air

the man holding the reins was nar-
row wiry and strictly unsmiling he
wore a broad-rimmed hat pushed well
back on his small head under which a
clump of iron-gray hair strung out loose-
ly even at that distance curt glimpsed
the eyes small and piercing
	masked rider western

  beside the man sat a slender lithe girl
her body swaying with the jerking motion
of the buckboard the dark glory of her
hair the proud way she held herself
captured curts attention and held it
then the wagon was abreast of him and
the man was speaking his pale bloodless
lips barely moving

  so you came back mason he re-
garded curt with taciturn interest

  evenly curt returned the older mans
cool inspection

  hello fenton he said casually

  you might say hello to me too curt
this new voice was soft and gentle fem-
inine with a strangely personal warmth

  curt turned slowly almost reluctant-
ly he lifted his eyes to the girl

  elaine was all he could gasp

  elaine fenton looked squarely at curt
her lips made a faint sweet line in smil-
ing her eyes shadowed deeply by dark
curving lashes were searching his sun-
browned face and were puzzled

  the years have changed you curt
she said

  he nodded smiling faintly a man
grows

  for the first time curt really looked at
her he was startled by her beauty there
was ripeness in her lips in every line of
her graceful figure from an awkward
gangling girl of sixteen elaine fenton
had developed into a young woman love-
ly and vibrant

  dan fenton stirred restlessly

  mason yuhre a fool he stated blunt-
ly curt raised speculative eyes toward
the older man take my advice and get
out of dawn

  youre the third man to tell me that
since i got back curts face took on a
drawn quick-tempered turn im gettin
plumb tired of it

  fenton held the reins in lean bony fin-
gers there was an angular hardness a
taut energy about this man it showed in
the narrowing intensity of his eyes in the
dry rustle of his voice

  youre here to find out who dry-
gulched your dad whoever that hombre
is you want to kill him right

  right snapped curt so swiftly that
elaine drew her breath

  curt she protested huskily

  curt glared at fenton not hearing
elaines muffled exclamation anger had
its way with him settling on his face leav-
ing it darker than it had been

  they bushwacked my father took the
cattle they left my mother with a broken
heart an nothin to look forward to but
death shes found that now his voice
sank murderously and his lids narrowed
well im a mason and im going to kill
them that killed nobody is goin to drive
me off this spread are you satisfied
thats what you wanted to hear aint it
an ironic smile that was more an
amused leer pulled down the corners of
fentons mouth

  its what i expected all youll get for
your trouble is a stomach full of lead
oh no dad cried elaine how can
you say that she turned to curt curt
you must go away youll be killed

  theres a blood debt to be paid he
answered ruthlessly

ilaines dark eyes flashed bitter-
ness crept into her voice

  when you talk like that i feel i dont
know you oh curt why cant you for-
get about your revenge what good can
all this killing do

  tom mason is dead the jasper that
killed him dont deserve to live

  mason youre buckin somethin
thats too big for one man dan fenton
broke in brusquely thats where your
father made his mistake youll lose ev-
erythin like tom mason did

  without another word the gaunt un-
smiling rancher took up the reins flicked
them over the rump of the big bay in
the traces the buckboard swung around
elaine held curt in view there was
deep hurt in her eyes but she said
nothing

  the buckboard creaked through the
heat haze and rumbled off toward the
road curt stood motionless in the yard
watching until the wagon rolled into a
dip in the road
gunsmoke on the range

   night came swiftly once the sun had
 dropped behind the distant peaks in a
 shower of crimson glory fusing clouds
 shadowed the far-off buttes and moved
 across the night sky darkness was on
 the land but a lamp moved in the mason
 corral

   the three punchers curt had singled
 out saddled up their horses mounted and
 rode out of the yard curt watched them
 head toward the distant upland pasture
 then turned to jed lance

   come on lets get some shuteye
 jed and the others greeted the sugges-
 tion with hollow grunts of assent there
 was no talk in these grim silent men
 they went to their low flat cots and flung
 themselves down fully dressed

    nights stillness shrouded the ranch-
 house within ten minutees there was no
 other sound save the heavy labored
 breathing of weary men

    the rattle of distant gunfire pulled curt
 wide awake he had no idea how long he
 had been asleep but the blast of those
 guns jerked him into immediate action
 he leaped up the other punchers joining
 him in one bound

   they raced to the rear door far up
 the slope of the meadow orange blobs of
 flame pierced the blackness

    looks like ki an the boys have struck
 trouble said curt harshly come on

 	were ridin i reckon this is the raid ive
 been waitin for chris he ordered the
 burly cookie you stay here and sort of
 keep an eye on things were ridin up
 there to see whats what

    without waiting for a reply he led a wild
 dash to the corral the three men swung
 into their saddles galloped toward the
 rising din of sound

next issue-

 killers die hard

    an exciting novelet of

    the frontier

  by syl mocdowell

 and many other stories



   the frantic bawling of frightened cattle
came to them on the wings of a rising
wind guns bellowed distantly moving
off curt dug in his spurs streaking across
the meadow

   ahead the grim tide of battle was surg-
ing toward the mesa trail pounding hoofs
shook the hard earth men shouted and
cursed above the staccato roars of six-
guns dust stirred up by the stampeding
herd choked the night air

through the gloom curt could see
a trio of riders climbing a steep shoul-
der of ground that would be ki and the
two other mason hands their guns blast-
ed into the darkness the leaden chal-
lenge was returned by other riders at
the rear of the running herd

  curt jed and buck sliced the distance
between the other mason riders and
themselves to a mere hundred yards
they took the first slope of the road in a
fierce leaping charge and poured down
the spur on the far side the trail dragged
up and down like that then swung be-
tween two low out-cropping bluffs

   curt pulled abreast of ki karton

  theyve got a big bunch pullin this
raid ki yelled this is the rear guard
were fightin another bunch is up
ahead drivin the cattle toward the mesa

   all right said curt grimly eyes glit-
tering well give em all we got ive
been achin to get a crack at the coyotes
who planted my old man an im bettin
this gang knows somethin about that

  the trail narrowed and threaded sharp-
ly upward it carried over a long spur
and dipped down again they shoved
headward through a brush-choked draw
and found themselves deep in a rolling
swale midway toward the towering cliffs
at its far end a cut-bank arroyo knifed
across the terrain

   ahead of them the moving flare of gun-
fire ceased the dim shapes of the cattle
thieves dropped out of sight bolting
across the uneven ground curt suddenly
hauled up sharply on the reins

  get back to cover he rapped out
theyre holin up in the arroyo
masked rider western



chapter iii

a sidewinder speaks up

mason spoke guns blasted
from the dry bed of the
stream a bullet sent curts
hat spinning off his head
another screamed by-into
a thud of lead hitting human
flesh the rider behind him
grunted and went limp
was buck jed lance spurred up in
time to keep the stocky puncher in the
saddle in one motion they spun around
and raced for the meager protection of
boulders against the circling ridge

  behind outcroppings of rock the ma-
son riders swung off their mounts quick-
ly they settled down to swapping lead
with the men in the arroyo unable to
see the cattle thieves curt and the others
had to be content with blasting away at
the occasional bursts of flame that lighted
the chunky blackness

  bullet after bullet ricocheted off the
rocks sending splinters of loose shale in-
to their faces while they fired away
curt was conscious of a sense of im-
patience the longer they stayed camped
behind the rocks the farther away the
cattle were being taken anxiety drove
him to a frenzy

  jed he shouted this is gettin us
nowhere that bunch in the arroyo is
holdin us off to make a clean break with
my steers then theyll blow weve got
to rush em

  youll walk into a hail of lead grunt-
ed jed

  an ill be throwin a hail of lead
stated curt

 jed blew a long breath through his
teeth

  if you go he said shaking his head
sadly count me in

  none of the other punchers said any-
thing but immediately the tall muscular
shape of ki karton detached itself from
the protection of an adjoining hunk of
granite behind him came guy norton
and sam weed

  curt crouched to the ground he held
out his ivory-studded colts the ham-
mers clicked back racing low out of
cover he led the mad assault

  hot tongues of flames spat through the
night between the draw and the arroyo
lead battered into ki a cry started from
his lips was instantly stilled as he col-
lapsed curts gun barked at a dull shape
rearing cautiously over the lip of the ar-
royo the shape tottered and fell

  curt went charging straight ahead a
bullet plowed a shallow furrow in his
shoulder he ran on a black darting tar-
get vaguely he saw two men stagger
up from the dry bed of the narrow basin
and spill guy norton and sam weed
were emptying belching guns toward the
bank

  weapons snarled on their right lead
whistled close curt fired toward the
stabbing dots of flame his guns grew hot
in his hands

  a man clambered out of the arroyo his
six-shooter swinging up in a swathe of
yellow fire he squeezed the trigger in
swift aim the click of a hammer striking
an empty cylinder made curt smile nar-
rowly

  but he brought up his own weapons-
and they were empty

  with a shove he threw the man back-
ward gained striking distance for his
good arm lashed out for the chin the
man dropped like a felled tree

  four riders whipped out of the arroyo
and pounded away firing wildly as they
fled then three others flashed out

furiously the masons shot at the
retreating shapes gunfire blasted
again and again dwindling rapidly into
the distant sound of scudding hoofs then
only the low murmur of the rising wind

  we licked em blurted jed passing a
broad arm across his forehead

  curt shook his head and stumbled to-
ward a motionless form sprawled full-
length on the ground

  i reckon they couldve slaughtered us
if they wanted to he said defeatedly
they lit out because they figgered the
gunsmoke on the range	

 others had gotten clean way with the
 steers

    curt knelt beside the still figure strik-
  ing a match he cupped the flame in steady
  hands the face of ki karton gray with
  the agony of slow bleeding death was
  etched in the lurid glow

    done for muttered curt thin-lipped
  he rose slowly with jeds aid he strap-
  ped ki across a saddle

   the grim dusty faces of guy norton
 and sam weed supporting the bowed
 shape of buck the wounded cowpunch-
 er rode close curt and jed with the
 body of ki between them led toward
 the mouth of the draw sadly silently
 the funeral procession headed back to the
 mason spread

   dawn found curt following the wide
 broken trail of the stolen cattle it led
 over climbing rangeland that knifed
 steadily upward toward the mesa deep-
 gouged peaks thrust jagged edges into
 the sky along the higher reaches

   curt was alone jed had wanted to go
 along but he and the others were needed
 at the ranch to guard what little stock
 remained after the raid

    an hour of steady riding carried him in-
  to wilder country the trail of cattle was
  still sharply defined curt had no trouble
  following it over sage flats it was a broad
  trail massed with the sign of many hoof-

	prints

    the white ball of the sun swung higher
  curt shifted his weight in the saddle and
  urged the big bay to a swifter gait a
  stone rattled over hard ground behind
  him

    curt strained to quick uneasy atten-
 tion he whirled going for his gun

   your smoke-polell be safe where it
 is grated the harsh voice of gil pate
 brad bealls foreman he rode out from
 behind a dense thicket crowding the
 shoulder of a low ridge to curts rear his
 hand gripped a long-barreled colt

   no change stirred curts emotionless
 features his hands rose slowly above his
 head he turned on the man a glance that
 was utterly cool

   ride ordered pate tersely beall

will want to see you

  the bay leaped forward under the prod-
ding pressure of curts spurs pata
trotted on behind

  dont go fannin for your gun ma-
son he warned youre a perfect tar-
get at this range i could put a pair of
bullets in your back before your iron
cleared leather

  curt grinned coldly thats about your
speed pate pluggin gents in the back
pate mouthed an angry oath and prod-
ded curts back with the barrel of his six-
shooter keep goin hombre fore i
plug you here and now

  curt and his captor jogged across a
short stretch of dry meadow then broke
into a rocky trail that ran west to the crest
of a ridge along the rim they rode un-
til it dropped down to the lush floor of a
valley amid the welter of low-lying hills
a frame house grayed by wind rain and
sun stood out in a grove of trees

they cantered into the yard came
around to the front porch and dis-
mounted pate prodded curt with his gun
again curt stamped up the steps and
strode across the veranda out of the tail
of his eye he noted two horses tethered to
a rangy poplar at the far side of the house

  he walked swiftly into the big front
room brad beall shoved his great bulk
out of a chair and grinned one side of
his face was still bruised and swollen
from their fight

  a short man with bowed legs and close-
set eyes peered intently at beall the
latter tilted his shaggy eyebrows a trifle
a signal had passed between those two
curt did not miss it the short man sidled
off taking up his station by a window
pate remained in the doorway

  curt glanced carefully about his mind
registering every detail-particularly the
unprotected window fronting the veranda

  what brung you here mason in-
quired beall with a leer

  arms above his head curt faced beall
and the little man his blood running high
with mounting fury

  you dont have to ask that beall
	masked rider western

 where are my steers

 beall smiled dangerously what makes
 you think i stole your cattle

 i just figger it that way

 the big ranchers heavy brows drew to-
 gether he hooked his thumbs in his
 crossed gunbelts and rocked back on his
 heels

 all right ill tell you he snarled
 you wont live long after i tell you any-
 way

 thats interestin remarked curt dry-
 ly-

 thought youd find it so you may be
 surprised mason but i didnt take your
 cattle

 no then who did

 the same hombre who bushwhacked
 your old man

 yeah who is that rasped curt
 skeptically talk fast beall

 dan fenton

 strange glints came into curts hard
 eyes youre a lyin polecat

 easy everybody a strangely familiar
 husky voice ordered harshly

 curts eyes jumped to the front window
 bealls hand traveled toward his hip halt-
 ed the little man at the end of the room
 froze

 dan fenton stood outside the window
 a long-barreled six-gun gripped tight in
 his bony hand his eyes were smoky with
 some bizarre moving passion at the
 doorway pate started to lift his gun

 drop your iron roared the gray-
 haired fenton

 pate slid a baleful glance toward fen-
 ton but relinquished his weapon

 fenton gave curt a tight-lipped morose
 smile beall wasnt lyin he said taut-
 ly i shot tom mason and swiped his
 cattle

 watching the older man with a keen
 searching glance curt made no answer
 there was something here he couldnt un-
 derstand fentons eyes were cold and de-
 fiant yet they held something in their
 bleary depths akin to despair

 dan fenton laughed immoderately
 that surprises you dont it he threw
 a leg over the low window sill and leaped

 into the room backed against the win-
 dow he faced the men in the room there
 was no warmth in his gray deep-lined
 face well heres another surprise i
 also led the raid on your beef last night

chapter iv

rustled redemption

oung curt maintained a
stony silence the set of hia
face hardening his whole
body growing taut

   fenton hitched up his worn
chaps his voice droned on

   yeah i killed your father
mason it was durin the big
raid tom mason got a bunch of his cow-
punchers together and followed my crowd
to the mesa we trapped em in a blind
canyon and wiped em out i hunkered
up behind your father he heard me and
started to turn but my guns were a sight
too fast for him

   whats the idea of blabbin out this
yarn fenton beall growled angrily he
let his arms dangle menacingly and took
a step forward

  up with your hands snapped fen-
ton youll see why in a minute
furiously beall raised his hands high
mason resumed the old man you
may not remember but when the masons
and the fentons and the bealls first came
to dawn times were hard nobody asked
questions everybody took what they
wanted once they got it it was their job
to hold on to it beall and me liked your
dads range we got it then beall spread
out and decided he wanted the range all
to himself he wanted more cattle too
so grated curt

   i been seein to it that he got the
cattle

  curts mouth drew down and his eyes
glinted dangerously

   fenton he gritted through clenched
teeth in a little while im goin to go
fannin for my gun i come back to get the
sidewinder that bushwhacked tom ma-
son seein youve laid yore cards on the
gunsmoke on the range	

  table im about ready to try my luck
  shut up and keep your hands still
  snapped fenton gnarled hand steady
  gray eyes rocklike if i wanted to i
  could drill you right here and now sud-
  denly his face lost its pale intensity and
  something went out of his voice leaving it
  dull and dreary yeah i ought to be
  proud of myself with all my thievin and
  the killin but i aint

    i aint never forgotten tom masons
  killin it has lived with me till im sick
  of it and you beall you thievin buz-
  zard youve held that drygulchin over
  my head ever since i been tryin to live
  respectable on account of elaine but you
  wont let me youve threatened to let the
  whole valley know about tom mason if
  i ever quit you

 beall laughed thinly how long do
 you figger im gonna listen to this
 tripe

    until ive finished fenton said quiet-
  ly but with infinite deadliness for five
  years youve made me do your dirty work
  beall ive rustled cattle for you until im
  plumb sick of it now im quittin you
  cold

no youre not try and pull out
try and keep me in replied fenton
he swung a razor-edged glance toward
curt im goin to help you get your
 beef back the herd is waitin in a natural
basin up beyond the mesa until beall gets
ready to haze em to shipton i reckon
its about time i did somethin decent
i dont want your help shot back
curt gruffly somehow his tone carried
no conviction something in the bold
lonely stand of fenton against the hostile
forces in the room moved him

    here was the man who had killed his
  father this was the man he should drill
  with hot lead dazedly curt realized he
  no longer wanted to kill revenge had
  suddenly lost its appeal the jarring fact
  angered him yet the feeling persisted
  was it because of elaine and the hurt look
  in her eyes when she had begged him to
  abandon his idea of revenge or was it
  some sudden change in himself

  he never answered the question to his
own satisfaction bealls harsh voice cut
the still tense air of the room

  pate you fool whatre you waitin
for drill him

  fenton wheeled quickly toward bealls
heavy-set foreman already fishing out
another gun pates arm came sliding
up and flame spurted from the barrel of
his weapon fenton fired at the same
time pate stiffened twisted slowly and
spun to the floor fenton dropped his gun
and both hands went clawing for his side

  while pates arm was still on the up-
swing curts gleaming colt cleared
leather the crash of his shot made a
single report of the three explosions his
gun half out of the holster the little man
by the rear window sagged a look of pain-
ed surprise on his thin pinched face he
fell against the wall as beall raced for the
window and plunged through in a crazy
head-first dive curt saw him go but his
only target was the flashing soles of bealls
boots

  he strode quickly to fenton who was
struggling weakly to his feet a splotch
of crimson stained his shirt spreading
rapidly pain deepened the grayness of
his face curt stopped and gave him the
gun he had weakly dropped

  why dont you kill me fenton de-
manded tonelessly

  i dont know curt said bluntly
mebbe because i never kick anybody
whos down he paused and mebbe
because i dont want to kill you

  fenton blinked his eyes they were
misty he staggered to the door support-
ing himself against the wall curt sprang
to his side

  where you goin

  i told you i was goin to get your
steers

  youre stayin here you cant move
with that wound

  youre crazy said fenton thickly
moving forward in a reeling stumbling
gait got to go  never find em unless
i show you----hidden in a natural ba-
sin

  curt laid a firm hand on his shoulder to
	masked rider western

hold him back but fenton thrust him
aside outside the old rancher staggered
to his horse he steadied himself waved
a hand toward the mesa

  my men already up there  sent

them hour agobeall will try to get

cattle awaymy men have orders 

 stop him----

somehow fenton managed to swing
up into the saddle curt raced to the
bay and joined him together they left
the yard and clattered off for the hills like
a pair of streaks

  the red stain covering fentons shirt
was swiftly blossoming his body jerk-
ed and bounced to the movement of his
spirited stallion each stride wrenched
new agony out of him but he kept his
lips clamped shut

  as they galloped into a gentle swale
and swerved up through a narrow pass at
the far end the pound of hoofs rattled be-
hind him curt pulled up whipping his
colt around a curve in the trail swept
elaine her dark hair flying behind her
came the three mason riders-jed sam
and guy

  dad where are you going elaine
gasped instantly she saw the bloodstain-
ed shirt dad youre hurt youve been
shot

  fenton stared vaguely at the girl as if
he did not recognize her curt drew aside

  we got restless back at the ranch so
we decided to hit the trail for the mesa
an see what was what jed explained
squinting under the suns scorching disk
in the cloudless sky

  youre just in time i reckon curt
answered grimly fenton is goin to
show us where the cattle are holed up

  how does he come to know guy
queried suspicion riding his tone

  curt explained briefly in an undertone
so the girl at her fathers side could not
hear

  you trust him demanded jed after a
short tense silence

  well have to curt looked beyond
jed toward the higher rises of the mesa
he spoke in a low tone why did yuh

bring elaine back here

  she wouldnt stay back jed told him
gruffly met her about a mile along the
trail she wanted to know where we were
headed and we told her we were lookin
for you reckon we looked kind of grim
and worried about you and she insisted on
cornin along

curt nodded intently then went back
to the girl elaine was pleading with
her father not to go on to let her tend to
his wounds fenton trotted forward re-
fused to listen

  she turned to curt her voice trembling
on the narrow border of panic

  why dont you stop him she cried
in horror

  he insists on showing me where my
stolen cattle have been taken

  overwhelmed by the haunting fear
that gripped her elaine did not wonder
how her father might know where the
cattle were instead she called frantical-
ly at fentons retreating back

  dad you cant go do you hear
fenton growled and swung his gun up
he waved it back at curt and the three
astonished riders behind him his voice
reached them thickly his eyes were not
altogether clear

  im goin to the mesa rest of you can
stay here if you want

  curt recoiled at the sudden desperate
set of elaines cheeks all right she
said im going too

  and that was that there was no time
for argument though he warned her that
there would be more shooting it had no
effect curt shrugged and motioned to
his three riders abruptly the little par-
ty rushed toward fenton at a ground-eat-
ing pace shooting up and out of the pass

  after an hour of hard riding over rocky
ground past low overhanging cliffs with
fenton growing weaker and barely able
to go on they swung into a narrow gorge

  fenton took the lead as the defile nar-
rowed forcing them to pick their way
carefully the three riders from curts
outfit strung along behind

  rocky bush-covered slopes rose on
gunsmoke on the range

both sides of them suddenly around a
bend in the trail they trotted past an
opening concealed behind a great pinnacle
of rock even fenton charged by it before
he pulled his horse to a sliding stop he
slumped forward in the saddle coughing
weakly

  heatedly refusing aid dan fenton
wheeled his horse back to the break in the
granite wall they poured through the
narrow aperture and raced along another
gorge which quickly splayed out before
curt was aware of it they had thundered
into a great bowl-shaped arena the floor
of the basin was covered with lush wav-
ing grass from a pocket under a cliff a
clear spring welled

  fenton halted them behind a dense
thicket and peered about carefully curts
eyes widened as he noted the rich fodder
springing up from the floor of the basin
 fodder enough for all the cattle on the
range then looking toward the far end
of the arena he saw a milling band of
hereford steers mason steers he was
sure of it two thousand of them at least

  watching the clear cold water flowing
out from under the cliff feeding the green
grass he realized that beall could keep
herds of stolen cattle holed up in the ba-
sin for any length of time before pushing
them across the desert to shipton the
next railway shipping point

  and looking toward the basins wide
western entrance he knew the steers had
been hazed in from that end some other
hidden trail led to that opening fenton
had really taken a short cut to come in
from the eastern side

  the harsh bellow of guns broke the
stillness a band of riders raced in from

       a gala roundup of
       best action fiction
       in every issue of-

five western
novels

  a big quarters worth at all standsi



the distant open mouth of the arena

  my riders choked fenton swaying
feeby in the saddle

another group of horsemen was
hazing the big herd toward the
arena entrance jed let out an angry
snort

  theres that polecat beall id like to
take a pot-shot at him just to give him a
taste of lead

  easy does it warned curt therell
be plenty of time for shootin

  below them bealls gunmen suddenly
whirled as fentons riders swept toward
them guns crashed steers bawled in
panic and drummed toward fentons men

  the horsemen swung wide around the
herd and surged toward the canyon wall
bealls hands abandoned their mounts and
took to the shelter of the rocks firing as
they scuttled for cover

  curt slid off his horse

  dismount he yelled from now on
we can do better on foot

  he ran to elaine and helped her to the
ground fenton meanwhile half-fell and
half-climbed down from his saddle curt
slapped the stallions flank and the horse
skittered off down the trail followed by
the other animals

  mebbe we can give beall a little sur-
prise party said curt grimly well
have to hole up behind those boulders be-
low us

  stumbling and slipping over the uneven
ground they scrambled off the ledge
down the slope to several huge rocks jut-
ting out from the canyons shallow sides
fenton could barely stand but his thin
mouth was set firmly he drew his six-
gun jed brought sam weed and guy
norton to another stubby granite crag
several rods to the right and below the
others

  bealls crew was scrambling up the in-
cline toward them then from the arena
floor came a fresh volley of shots as fen-
tons hands spilled from their saddles
and raced to the rocks slinging lead at the
running shapes above them

 chapter v

war to the end

entons shaggy head clear-
ed the boulders side he cut
loose with his iron at the
running figure of a man be-
low him the bullet must
have crashed into the man
for he was knocked off bal-
ance he staggered and fell
sideways rolled down the slope until his
body struck an outcropping rock

  simultaneously jed and the two ma-
son hands began discharging a deadly
hail of lead into the rocks and bushes
that sheltered bealls crew sixty yards
away

  elaine stood up a small pistol in her
hand the weapon bucked and smoke
curled from the short barrel guns roar-
ed dead ahead bullets chipped flinty
pieces of rock into her face

  curt whirled facing the girl

  stay here he directed tersely im
movin off behind that boulder on your
left

  he indicated another smaller crag half
hidden by a clump of mesquite for an
instant their eyes met and held then he
turned away

  crouched low he darted over the rough
ground a bullet whipped up dust at his
feet another bounced off the rock to-
ward which he was headed but no lead
stopped his crouching rush

  to the boulders far side he ran scan-
ning the bushes quickly he turned fired
at smoke pluming out from a low chunk
of granite a furtive movement to his
left told him that someone was trying to
flank him he dropped to the ground as
a gun exploded lead ricocheted off the
rock above his head as he hit the
ground and rolled over he drilled a shot
toward a spout of flame behind a mass of
sumac

  then not ten yards away he saw the
gaping muzzles of two revolvers and the
leering face behind them he lurched to
one side his gun belching fire a hot

searing pain streaked along his left thigh
at the same instant his foe pitched to
the ground chest torn by a fiery slug

  the sporadic firing of bealls crew
raged closer now hard-pressed by the
surge of fentons men below the cattle
thieves were trying to scale the slope and
reach the ledge for a getaway

  curts glance shifted to the boulder
that sheltered his three riders they were
firing as fast as their fingers could pull
the triggers then he saw a rustler sneak-
ing forward under cover his gun blasted
the drygulchers big body jerked as a
slug shattered his neck his chin dropped
to his chest and he jounced down the
slope	

  suddenly from a protected spot on
curts right elaines high-pitched scream
rose the sound snapped his attention to
the low rock shielding the girl and her
father he saw dan fenton drop his gun
hands at his chest where another bullet
had tom into him this time the rancher
collapsed without a struggle elaine ran
to him picked up his head and cradled it
against her breast

  a surge of recklessness electrified
curts nerves he straightend and limped
directly across the intervening space six-
guns smashed lead past his face heat
scorched the lobe of his left ear and fresh
blood dripped down his sweat-streaked
face

  but he reached elaine her eyes were
swimming with tears great sobs racked
her lithe slender frame

  hes dying i know it she cried
rocking the gray head in her arms

curt dropped to his knees he peer-
ed at the fresh wound smearing fen-
tons reddened shirt he shook his head
gravely fentons eyes were going glassy
his mouth trembled open

  mason he mumbled faintly

  yeah queried curt in a strangely
quiet tone

  fenton made a feeble motion toward
elaine she raised puzzled eyes to curt
gesturing silently toward the far end of
the rock he took the heavy burden from
gunsmoke on the range	

her arms she stumbled to her feet and
moved frightened but obedient

  a rattling breath gasped out of fenton
pain drained his face cut deeper the
sharp lines around his eyes

  mason he whispered elaine she
doesn know about me and-yore old man
-and all the thievin she thinks im
straight

  curts head lowered his hard mouth
softened something strayed into his
eyes that had not been there before

  if itll make it any easier for you he
said gently i didnt hear a thing about
you and you didnt tell me anythin

  fenton stared up at curt the strain
slowly leaving his face

  thanks he gasped dont deserve it
nohow but-

  the voice broke off curt peered quick-
ly at the agonized sun-bronzed face in
his arms he pulled off his stetson
bunched it in a knot and pillowed the old
mans head on it

  elaine rushed over grief tearing at her
one look at curt and she knew the
answer to her fears but she was dry-
eyed now as she bent to the motionless
figure on the ground curt strangely
moved lurched off

  down the slope a loud yell suddenly
went up the bellow of guns ceased as
abruptly as it had begun curt peered
out from behind the boulder bealls
men had surrendered and were being
herded back to the canyon floor by fen-
tons riders

  jed and guy found there was nothing
they could do for sam weed whose neck
had been broken by a bullet they slid
down the slope to join the fenton crowd

  curts shoulders hunched forward re-
lief further sapped his weary frame sigh-
ing he turned back to elaine one limp-
ing step he took and froze at the clatter
of slipping rocks off to his left the hulk-
ing figure of a man leaped to shelter be-
hind a granite crag curt whirled he
didnt need to see the mans face to know
it was brad beall he inched forward
painfully over the sharp rocks and loose
shale

  beall climbed steadily curt followed
more slowly impeded by his wounded
leg suddenly the big rancher reached
the ledge aimed his six-gun dead at curt
the gun roared curt ducked a slug
zipped by harmlessly beall ran along the
ledge curt made a fresh spurt for the
brim beall stumbled over a jutting rock
and spilled by the time he regained his
feet curt had closed the distance be-
tween them

  youll never get away beall curt
swore between gritted teeth

  bealls gun lifted in a fast-moving arc
a triumphant grin twisted his scarred
face curt lurched sideways but there
was no explosion only the hollow metallic
click of a hammer tripping down on an
empty chamber

  tough luck beall grated curt his
lips a white thin line pain fogged his
eyes he shook his head to clear it and
limped nearer

  why dont you shoot mason de-
manded the burly sidewinder with a
sneer his dark face betraying no fear

  it can wait curt told him in a deadly
tone he whipped a six-gun from his left
holster what do you say beall are
you willin to try your hand on the draw
with me

ealls eyes narrowed he smiled
mirthlessly the long scar on his
cheek whitening

  sure why not

  curt tossed one of his colts to the
ground a few feet in front of the rancher

  well start even he declared when
you pick up that iron you can holster it
and well start from scratch he winced
against the bolting rush of pain and nau-
sea through him watching intently beall
grinned

  curt straightened with an effort beall
stood half-crouched curt returned his
other gun to its holster slowly bealls
towering frame bent and he scooped up
the six-gun he swung up in a vivid flash
of speed the gun blaring in his hand

  curt had expected just that his gun
blazed from his hip no eye could match
	masked rider western

that flare of action

  but something slapped him back a step
cut viciously along his skull roaring fill-
ed his ears and he fought to stay erect
dimly he saw bealls mouth fly open but
no cry came forth for what seemed a
long time the big rustler bent like a dry
reed in a strong breeze then he fell flat
on his face

  curt staggered to his victims side re-
moved the gun from the stiffening fingers
weakly he started back down the slope
toward elaine sliding and lurching in the
loose shale twice he caved to the
ground the second time he barely
struggled to his feet his head throbbed
and fire danced in his blurring eyes

  he moved on hardly conscious of
where he was going he felt his legs
buckle then pressure met his shoulders
and steadied him some of his ebbing
strength flowed back he saw elaine be-
side him her arms supporting part of his
weight

  the girls drawn worried face tilted

  curt are you all right she breath-
ed when i heard the shots and saw you
up there i thought you would be-

  what did you think elaine curt
demanded eagerly not letting her finish

  impulsively her arms went about his
neck her lips crushed against his mouth
and for a moment a strange ecstasy swept
them

  at last her hands pushed him gently
away curt gazed at her steadily and his
eyes were tender

  you were right about revenge and
killin he murmured gently it took me
a spell to find out though what happen-
ed five years ago to dad is past i reckon
the past can stay where it is

  you didnt find out who shot your
father then

  curt gave her a crooked smile no
im kind of glad i didnt reckon im just
glad we licked beall and his gang of am-
bushers now we can start building a
range kingdom of our own

 we

  curt nodded elaines eyes lifted saw
the trickle of blood running from his
scalp swiftly they dropped to the dark
sticky stain running the length of his
left trouser leg

  youre hurt ill get  something to
bandage your wounds

  its nothing he said a bullet part-
ed my hair and another nicked my leg
nothin to make a fuss about

elaine stared at him not entirely re-
assured she was silent a moment
and her face worked with inner troubled
thoughts

  curt she began her voice low and
strained how did dad know where-
to find your cattle he seemed to know
the way so well

  curts face was immobile but he smiled
inwardly

  i reckon for some time he suspected
that jasper beall of stealin cattle meb-
be he didnt tell you he was losin steers
regular curt paused astonished at the
ease with which the words came i figger
hed been watchin beall all along and be-
fore that last raid he mustve discovered
this basin probably found some of his
own beef there then before he could go
ridin against beall the polecat up and
raids my place

  elaines face cleared to a sad smile she
turned and they started slowly down the
slope again in the west the sun had
dropped below the horizon but light still
fingered up on the mesa

  pain shuddered through curt again
but he thrust it from him then the girl
tilted her face toward him again her
voice choked a little aj she spoke one
more thing curt darling what was it
that dad said to you before he-he-
curt paused and his arm went around
her slender waist

  he asked me to take care of you he
said gently and thats just what i aim
to do from now on

next issue horsemen of the twisted trails by donald bayne hobart
trail talk

  continued jrorn page 

were mexican bandits smart enough to fig-
ure out the stage schedule and just when it
would arrive at the spot and with robbery
as their motive for the attack they would not
have left the money and other valuables
that were found scattered around the scene

  one of the mail sacks had been cut open
and its contents scattered the other mail-
bag was left untouched the baggage of the
passengers was broken open and articles
of little value were carried away while large
sums of money remained and this would
seem to bear out the belief that it was just a
band of uneducated indians

  after trailing the assassins toward the
the camp date creek reservation munroe
and his posse returned to wickenburg and
were met by captain meinholdt and some
soldiers who then made up a party consisting
of the soldiers and a number of citizens and
started out further to trail the assassins

  they trailed the savages to the place they
had entered the reservation it is said that
the trail sign was somewhat confusing as
the attackers often seemed to have scattered
as if they had been scared away from each
other in some manner but they came to-
gether again before reaching the reserva-
tion and the tracks were those of men who
wore moccasins and were round-toed like
those of apaches

the jurys verdict

  the verdict rendered by the coroners
jury was to the effect that the victims came
to their death from gunshot wounds inflicted
by indians the jury was composed of f
purcella david morgan aaron barnett
charles h richardson julius goldwater w
w weber dennis may charles barbour
and the foreman of the jury was mack mor-
ris they had studied the evidence and came
to the conclusion that the attack was made
by apaches

  in the face of the evidence as produced be-
fore the jury holding the inquest there were
still those who claimed that the massacre
was the work of renegades hired by men who
wished for their own selfish reasons to dis-
credit the apaches and there was one story
told by a man named j m bryan who was

commonly called crete to the effect that
he had been warned by a mexican woman
donna tamase not to ride the stage she
had stated that she had overheard mexicans
plotting to rob the stage some time after the
massacre bryan told that she had further
told him that she had gotten one of the mexi-
cans she overheard planning the robbery a
fellow by the name of parenta drunk on
wine and he told her all about how the mas-
sacre was handled

  according to parentas story robbery was
the motive parenta said he did not take
part in it as he had an attack of illness right
at the time and did not go to the scene of the
ambush with the others and he further stated
that the scalping was done to throw the
blame on the apaches and to keep suspicion
from the real band that did the killing

  here again it would seem that any bunch
of bandits with brains enough to plan and
execute a dastardly deed of this kind and
also cunning enough to figure on throwing
the blame on someone else would be smart
enough not to overlook or leave behind the
wealth that was left scattered and untouched
on the scene the whole story of bryan was
practically disproved by general crook
who came very strongly into the picture of
the apaches by reason of the massacre

  surely those who are entrusted with gath-
ering the data for marking such monuments
in arizona would not authorize the emphatic
inscription that appears on the bronze
plaque that marks the monument plainly
stating that it marks the spot where mohave-
apaches attacked the ehrenberg-wicken-
burg stage and massacred most of the occu-
pants unless there were overwhelming evi-
dence to support the claim

general crook investigates

  early in  the perpetrators of the mas-
sacre having still not been apprehended and
their identity still not discovered general
crook took up the investigation determined
to bring them to justice

  an apache-mohave indian boy who had
been raised by dan oleary a well-known
indian scout told that the robbers had sent
for him to get him to tell the denominations
of the currency they had taken in the raid
on the stagecoach and after gathering a lot
of evidence general crook in march 
accompanied by lieutenants bourke and
ross started from fort whipple along the
mohave road toward the colorado river

  they reached beale springs where the
general succeeded in getting some wallapai
indians to agree to go out and help him per-
suade the apache-mohaves to come into
camp date creek where they were to be
fed and taken care of by the government

  this was a ruse to get hold of the robbers
and might have worked but right at that
time the general received orders to cease
hostility toward the indians and leave the
entire matter to the peace commisisoners
who were about to arrive in arizona

  in august of the same year the general
having been granted authority to chastize
bad indians set out again with lieutenant
ross henry hewitt and a few others he
started the hunt for the murderers before
leaving his headquarters he sent couriers to
the apache-yamas and the apache-mo-
haves asking them to meet him in conference
at date creek only a few of them came for
the meeting

a tell-tale signal

  it was planned that those under crooks
command who knew the assassins of the
stagecoach party would hand each of them
a piece of tobacco and when this was done
the soldiers were to arrest those with the
tobacco one of the first to be handed to-
bacco was chief ochoama and the manner
in which the wily chief hung his head made
it appear that he sensed what was up

  as the last indian was handed tobacco a
soldier attempted to arrest him another
indian stabbed the soldier in the back the
soldier drew his gun and fired then a ter-
rible fight ensued with general crook in the
thick of it trying as best he could to stop
the carnage one indian took aim at the gen-
eral but just as he fired a soldier shoved the
general out of the line of fire and the bullet
killed another indian

  the chief who was said to be one of the
worst murderers of the desert country was
hard to subdue it took four men finally to
pin him down and bind him he was put in
the guard house from which he escaped was
shot twice pierced by a bayonet once but
made good his escape-only to die in the
mountains of his wounds

    seven apaches were killed in the fight
  and many others wounded the soldier who
  was stabbed died of his wound an hour
  later

    the casualties on both sides would have
  been much greater had it not been for the
  efforts of general crook in trying to get
  both sides to cease fighting thus ended the
  first phase of the tracking down of the assas-
  sins of the wickenburg stage party but it
  was to lead to greater effort to kill off the
  menace of the apaches

   there are many monuments along the
  highways of the west where the highways
  touch historic spots spots made memorable
  by incidents that took place when the pio-
  neers were blazing the trails westward and
  doing their bit toward making the west one
  of the richest sections of our great united
  states

  angus petersons heart was harried
  by hatred an irrational hatred that
  covered all the kith and kin of a man who
  had once accidentally done him great harm
  and the poison of his hate spilled out over
  tall cedar valley like a bitter spring of
  alkali souring the green grasses of affection
  that might have comforted his loneliness if
  only he had been able to muster the mood
  to receive them even in the heat of battle
  the old corrosive pain bit at his heart like a
  rapacious insect trying to gnaw its way to
  freedom and only when the masked rider
  brought into his life the healing force of his
  strength and understanding did old angus
  begin to soften

   how this came about is recounted in
  horsemen of the twisted trails
  by donald bayne hobart the featured novel
  in the next masked rider western
  and twisted indeed are the trails that wayne
  morgan and his other self the masked rider
  travel with the fearless and faithful apache
  blue hawk in their brave battle to unwind
  the tangled skeins that have friend suspect-
  ing friend and neighbor suspecting neighbor
  of the series of raids depredations burnings
  and assorted skulduggeries that transform
  tall cedar valley from a peaceful beef pas-
  ture inhabited by fun-loving cow people to
  a place of horror and apprehension


  so devastating were the raids of this mys-
terious and sinister band who swept down
from the hills under the cover of darkness
leaving death and charred ruins in their
wake that the band soon came to be known
as the vultures a fitting name for this
carrion-mad crew of scavengers and destroy-
ers

  yet in spite of the frequency and devastat-
ing effect of their activities not a soul ever
saw one name him-or if they did-either
through fear or for some foul purpose of
their own they never disclosed that weighty
knowledge so cleverly did the vultures
conceal their tracks that whether the master
mind of the outfit was one of the merchants
of the town of pitchfork a cedar valley
rancher or someone holed up in the high
and lonesome was a matter for only the
most shadowy conjecture and a conjecture
that it would be more than unwise to display
in public

 wayne morgan had heard vague rumors
of trouble in cedar valley and where trouble
lives there goes morgan for a visit either
short or extended depending on how long
the trouble can hold out after his arrival

  riding his ever-ready roan with the ac-
coutrements of his dual personality carefully
concealed in his cantle roll ready for any
emergency that would require the extraor-
dinary influence of the masked rider whose
name had become a legend of fearless effi-
ciency and high-hearted adventure and
sided by the silent copper-skinned companion
of many a hard fought battle and many a
long and weary trail of hardship morgan
followed the underground rumblings of war
till they led him to the valley of the tall
cedars and the cowtown of pitchfork

 there a ready-made ambush proved to
him that his coming had not been un-
heralded

  how morgan asked himself after he had
made the acquaintance of the principle vic-
tims of this weird and unfathomable cow-
country mystery could such deeds be done
without ever a suspicion of the identity of
the raiders some twenty more or less in
number emerging into the open

  some devious and fiendishly brilliant
scheme must be in operation in this situa-
tion and the planner of it must be one to
try the mettle of brain brawn and gun skill
of even such men as the masked rider and
so it turned out to be

 as wayne morgan he made the acquaint-
ance of angus peterson the dour vengeance-
ridden scandinavian-scott of his foreman
steve ward of the stantons bill and caro-
line the innocent objects of angus perverse
and relentless hate of the devious lawyer
norton of harney burke a man as limber
in changing sides as an eel in an undertow
and of a place called lucky town

 he met the denizens of the golden spur
saloon a soft-spoken gambler named thorn-
ton a disappearing sheriff and numerous
others who went to make up the warp and
woof of as subtly and complexly patterned a
picture of high-handed and low-principled
rangeland sleight-of-hand as you would
come across in a month of fourth-of-julys
and with as many firecrackers

  in the role of masked rider straddling
his high-headed muscle-haunched flame-
hearted coal-black stud horse midnight
wayne morgan took action on all that he
had pieced together into a well-nigh in-
credible fabric from the fragments of start-
ling information that he had gleaned he
had learned much through innocent and
friendly contact with all the characters who
rode the stage of this fear-ridden valley like
puppets pulled hither and yon by strings
held in unknown hands

  in the end morgan is faced by a decision-
and a battle-weighted answer to that deci-
sion that would try the stout heart of a
mighty warrior how he meets that double
challenge is a story that is yours in the next
masked rider western which con-
tains the new novel horsemen of the
twisted trails by donald bayne ho-
bart which relates the latest adventures of
the great robin hood of the range

 and as an additional dividend of good
western reading there will be the usual side
dishes of novelets short stories and articles
that go to round out this good book of the
boundless west

it appears that many of you readers
agree with us that joseph chadwick
hit a high spot in masked rider novels

fafdhibutsi to you jjdjcoj

community chest


with his story riders of bushwhack
range in the last issue from the time this
novel was written we were convinced that
it would have a good reception here is a
sampling of reader reaction

  i and my family have been reading masked
rider western for many years and we al-
ways wonder how you can possibly go on for so
long making the stories better and better al-
ways we think now this is the best possible
story this is a wonder a wow a super-duper-
colossal-meligorgeous-crash-hit from the top
of the heap but though some of the stories
dont always strike home strongly you always
get around to one that we consider better than
any that has gone before

 we have been reading masked rider
stories for some fifteen years more or less and
all of us are prepared to rise up on our hindlegs
in public meeting and state in a loud and far
reaching voice that joseph chadwicks riders
of bushwhack range narrated as absorb-
ing interesting exciting and satisfying an ad-
venture as we have ever lived through with
that redoubtable rangeland rescuer wayne mor-
gan alias the masked rider keep this up
and you will have an increasing family of
masked rider fans

-vinson b magruder sioux city iowa

  and another reader approaches it from
a different point of view funny when a
story is generally approved of how many
different reasons readers can find for their
approval it is fascinating to sit here and see
letter after letter come in praising a story
but with each one presenting an individual
viewpoint

  what a story was set off in riders of bush-
whack range by the need of a little pinch of
salt need causes action and action leads to
counter action and counter-action to more ac-
tion thats how the tangled trails of history are
made the thing we like about the masked
rider is his wholesomeness his unhesitating
choice of the right when the possibility of taking
two courses one easy and one hard looms be-
fore him i was impressed by a statement in the
preview of riders of bushwhack range
in the april number of masked rider which
said wayne morgan props up the desperate
panicky bravery of owens with his own indomi-
table brand of cool headed courage and wis-
dom 

  that is the thing that strikes me about wayne
morgan what seems to be a complete absence
of fear which enables him to think clearly and

 act reasonably and courageously in any situation
 most of us probably can screw up our courage
 and manage somehow or other to face a tough
 deal but how many of us are so free of fear
 that we treat danger like an ordinary business
 problem when you see a man like that you see
 a great man-wayne morgan is like that

             -vivian goznik peru maine

  another reader expresses the craving for
 contact with reality in fiction that we all
 feel most of us dont care what kind of
 situations the author invents or how wild
 his imagination is in making up the physical
 trappings of fiction-but we do insist that
 once the state of affairs is established the
 characters will act the way real characters
 would under those circumstances

  i liked riders of bushwhack range by
joseph chadwick even more than most mask-
ed rider stories because the people in it
seemed so real the young rancher walt owens
reacted just the way we would like to think we
would have but some of the others who didnt
have the courage to fight the faraum crowd had
plenty of cause to be afraid

  from the beginning where morgan and blue
 hawk were in need of salt and morgan went
 hunting for it the story was full of human

 writes about and knows anything about cow-
