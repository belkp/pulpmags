september price lo cents by the year ifiv-aug -islosfc in old times a soft skin and a fine complexion were accounted among the leading essentials of beauty and so they are today they knew in old times that the kind of beauty that is natural
    is a thousand times more admired than beauty that is artificial
    and they know it today also

     the great difference between old times and now in this matter
     of beauty is this in old times-that is before -they had no

  pears soap

     to afford natural aid to natural beauty whereas today pears is here
     making the preservation and improvement of complexion and of skin
     health and skin beauty generally an easy daily habit-just the habit of
     the daily use of pears that is all this is one great reason why there
     are so many more beautiful women to be seen today than ever there were

the best beautifying
forces of both old
times and new are
united in pears

bringing out the nat-
ural loveliness of
complexion which is
womans chief charm

  of all scented soaps pears otto of rose is the best

joys of the railroad joker

by richard maxwell win an s

practical joking in order to get even with somebody is often fast and
furious among railroad men sometimes however the patience of him on
whom the joke is played may be tried a little too far and in such a case
monkeying with a buzz-saw is apt to prove a safe occupation compared with get-
ting into the bad graces of a train-crew you generally have to go some to get
a railroad man thoroughly aroused but when he is sore look out he can fur-
nish more unexpected varieties of shocks and thrills and unpleasant brands of
hair-raising excitement than any other thwarted individual

some unexpected shower-baths that were hardly appreciated by the
bathers and other less gentle disciplinary measures that
worked rapidly toward a result

ank sure could snore some
  promiscus an he was
  pullin a extra heavy string
  of it that afternoon it was
  a reglar double-header on
  the up-grade drawin hard

   he just lay there with his mouth gapped
like an open furrrtice and the intake showed
he had something of a forced draft he was
givin a mighty good imitation of the deep
bass whistle on one of the big hog-backs
pullin in through bent knee cut and callin
for the switch at the end of the turn-out-
only hank had the tremolo stop pulled out
complete and his tremoloing was of the hair-
raisin brand

  finally it got on our nerves plumb
scanalous

  wed come in offn our runs that after-
     rr	

noon pretty well fagged out with the uncom-
mon heat and wed pulled our freight for
that dinky old bunk-house for a wink er
two an some rest-not to have our nervous
system side-swiped and ditch-wrecked by a
bloomin galoot that snored so infernally
that it made the goose-flesh decorate our
spinal column

   all the boys had made a try at it in
good faith but there werent any of us none
too pleased with the outlook for a snooze
leastwisenot in that bunk-house while hank
was under steam-and outside the flies was
thick enough to pick the meat offn your
bones and the sun hot enough to cook it for
em aforehand

  after wed passed all the loose furniture
and movable things over his way careless-
like through the air and got no moren a


the railroad mans magazine

short cussin for our trouble-for hank d
wake up jest long enough to bat an eye and
then turn to a snorin agin-why steve he
intimates he has an idea-which was runnin
some for steve

   he pulls on his trousers and hikes for
the tool-shed and when he comes back he
was a totin a gate-valve nozzle in one hand
and a luggin in a line of hose with the other
screwin on the nozzle he says  now if one
o you kickers  go out to the hydrant and
turn on the water why ill wet down that
hot box over there so it wont squawk so
much even if i have to drown it an swim
out myself

administering the water cure

   but nobody wanted to miss the show
so he closes the nozzle-valve and turns on the
hydrant himself then he gits back of the
locker in the clear of anything movin his
way suddenlike while we all pretends to
be asleep but with eyes a blinkin an facin
hanks bunk an steve he cuts loose with a
full head o pressure hittin hank in the
open stoke-door first squirt out which made
him close his trap immediate then he
opens his eyes and shut em agin sudden

  well you should see him a coughin and
a spittin and a sputterin an a throwin out
his arms and gyratin like a man tryin to
swim a whirlpool and all the time lavin on
his back while steve was a floodin his
steam dome and chest hed been dreamin
right through all the noise hed been makin
for when he finally turns over and tries to
swim out o bed he says

    durn that draw i knowed wed run
into it open some night and go down swim
for your lives fellers i cant help you 

   then he comes out of it entire and con-
nects with the floor all telescoped into a
heap by that time steve turned off the
moisture and beat it outside the noise
woke the rest of us and we poked our heads
out to ask what the fit was all about-and
then we pulled em in agin quick

  hank spied us a laughin and we hadnt
any more n backed into the clear when
hank begun to heave everything from shoes
to chairs our way and he wasnt playin any
favorites either

a cessation of hostilities

   he was jest strikin a average on the
chance of gittin the right man and poor
old dave that hadnt set in the game at all

got a wallop in the wind with a number ten
that started a smash-up that mighty near
called for the services of the wreckin crew

   after wed got em pried apart and
pulled their fires to prevent another explo-
sion steve drifts in unconcerned like and
wants to know whats wrecked the shack

   seein he needed informin we told him
nears we knew some sticklers for peace and
quiet over at the roundhouse had sneaked in
an soused a few buckets ofwater over hank
to drown the night haws that was right fast
gettin the better of him-the which im not
for sure certain that hank ever believed
but he had to let it go at that not bein able
to hang it on any one of the bunch par-
ticular

  well says steve unhookin a chair
from the hat-rack where hank d hung it
durin the fusillade of bricky-brac  this is
sure shower-bath weather all right makes
a feller feel comfortable cool for a spell till
he gits het up agin

    anyhow he continues leanin the back
of his chair aginst the card-table  hank
come off easier n a bunch of guys did on a
run up to the soo line i happened to be on
once

   sleep was shunted onto the sidin for
all of us by that time so we lit our pipes
and bunched up to hear steves experience

he says

the con butts in

   i was firin for dan purcell the year
before we both come east i was still a
right smart kid we was pullin one of them
harvest-home or some such excursions from
chamberlain down to sioux falls though
why any one wanted to go to sioux falls in
them days i dunno unless it was some east-
erner as had rough-house at home an want-
ed to jump a claim there long enough to
git a divorce

    we had ten coaches out an they was
pretty well filled with a mixture of every-
thing from professors from the government
indian school to indians and cowboys some
of em ridin in from as far out as crow
creek and zickrick

    them cow punchers had a lot of devil-
try corked up in their systems besides what
they had corked up in other things and once
in so often theyd pull th cork out o both

    they all bunched up in the three rear
coaches which they comfortably filled and
they were peaceable enough at the start
there wasnt any kick coinin till we got to
joys of the railroad joker

he finally turns over and tries to

swim out of bed

pukwana when durin the stop to take on
the contingent there about twenty or more
of em climbed on top of the rear coach

    i spotted em as i looked back when
we made the bend at the end of the turn-out
an i tells dan an he tells the conductor
when we gits to white lake

    the con was a young man but old
enough in that neck of prairie to know some-
thing of mr cow punchs disposition so
he makes his invite to them high-roosters to
come down kind of gentle and polite addin
softlike that it was strictly aginst the rules
of the passenger-traffic department to ride
either on top of or under the wagon an that
hed git fired unceremonious if he allowed
them the forbidden privilege

an invitation refused

   but they wasnt moved to tears none
by his heart-to-heart pleadin and assured
him in well-seasoned if not well-chosen talk
that it was too roarin hot inside the wagon
for them and that they wouldnt ride there
and that they proposed to stay where they
was and enjoy the fresh air and gentle
breezes of the prairie

    right then the con had some urgent
business elsewhere and he gives us the ball
to hit the trail ahead before we got to
plankington the con held a confab with some
of their friends inside and induced them to
make a try at gettin the fellows up above
to come down off their perch when we
stopped the result was so much powder
smoke hangin around that car it looked like
a prairie fire there wasnt anybody hurt
they wasnt shootin that way-jest foolin
like but the bunch on top managed to burn
up their last round of ammunition

    the insiders didnt take the turn-down
to their invite none too gracious and so they
framed up a job on the outsiders before they
got to mount vernon the last stop west of
mitchell when we pulled up at the depot
there the whole outfit tumbled out and kept
the outsiders attention attracted by tryin to
persuade em to come down which they
knew they wouldnt while a couple of em -
went into the depot and gave the agent a
telegram to send ahead to mitchell

    it was a request to have the fire depart-
ment at the station all coupled up an ready
for quick action if they wanted to witness
some ripe fun when the special pulled in


the railroad mans magazine

   a westerner is a sure enough maverick
if he isnt always ready to play a hand in
a game of amusement and pay the price at
that

    when we got to mitchell there was the
fire department in full attendance with their
apparatus equally divided to north and
south of the train the two cowboy leaders
in the game was off an runnin fr the chief
before the train had stopped with the other
pilin out ready for the cornin doins

dampening their ardor

    then things started to happen the
chief gave an order and the engines puffed
and chugged an wetness galore poured out
of the half dozen nozzles on both sides of
the rear car right then the cowboys round-

ed up and took charge of the ceremonies
they proved their aim -was as good with a
hose-nozzle as with a gun-barre

    they didnt give the top perchers nary
an invite to come down this time the play
evident was to keep em from gittin down
for if a stream hit a man hard on one side
and threatened to knock him off the roof
the punchers on the other side turned a line
on him and forced him back to center and
soon they was all lavin hard down on their
shirt bosoms holdin on to the ventilator
coop to keep from bein washed off

    a few tried to git down over the ends
of the car but they got the streams fairly
under em and was naturally squirted back
on top agin them cusses kept a playin
the hose on the bunch a top of the train
durin the whole of the stop for eats at the
lunch - room the reglar
firemen meantime enjoy-
in th show a holdin
their sides with laughin

    when it was time
to pull out the punchers
turned the hose and the
price of several wet
lunches over to the fire-
men and pullin a gun
or two apiece ordered
the soused rats on top to
stay where they was till
we got to soo falls or
till they felt they jest
couldnt any longer re-
sist the natural tempta-
tion to come down and
buy drinks for the bunch
inside

    but they proved
good resisters both ways
from the middle for
they stuck it out clean
into sqo falls and be-
ing plumb out of ammu-
nition they stood for the
rankest kind of guyin
at every stop we made

    the p  a v didnt
wind up till after theyd
been in soo falls for
about an hour when
theyd got stocked up on
prairie licker and took
on a fresh supply of gun
food and then it took
all the polite force and
part of the citizens to
prevent the towns grave-

 when we stopped
the result was
so much powder
and smoke

yards from bein filled up complete in one
instalment

    well says hank whod been busy
bangin up his extemporany wash and gittin 
inside some dry togs  i aiivt got gizzard
enough to send any man out on the long
run ahead of his natural schedule howsom-
ever much i feel id like to on this particu-
lar occasion but i will say id like to ham-
mer the stuffin loose in the onregenerate
son-of-a-hand-car that spoiled my cozy trip
to sleepy holler

proving his innocence

    now look here son interjects dave
 you can blame it all on your infernal saw-
mill hollerin on the trip that the run was
ditched but whoevers to blame it aint
your uncle dave i turned a heap of water
on a feller once and give him a duckin to a
finish- but when it come his turn he mighty
nigh makes a finish of me and i havent in-
dulged in the pastime of gittin folks wet
leastwise not outside for a long time

    it was a good many years ago that i
got mine continues dave

    i was firin one of them little two-by-
four pocket editions on the nickel plate with
billy ryan at the throttle well it may be
hot in arizonny an texas but they aint got
anything on the vineyard-belt along the lakes
when it takes a notion to get real hot upon a
real hot day and no breeze a blowin it was
so hot that day you could have fried an egg
on the top of a rail anywhere

    we picked her up at cleveland it was
one of them niagara falls excursions and
the bargain-counter fare had give em a
pretty jammed-up load it was hot enough
in them coaches to hold a clambake and it
werent no wonder some of em wanted to ride
on the platforms the which of course was
against the rules

    but the con who was a young feller had
sort of a human gizzard on his insides so he
lets em out for an airin between coaches
there bein no vestibules all but the front
platform next the engine not carrying any
baggage their luggage bein mostly lunch-
boxes-and he drives em all in from there
after havin a right smart argument with one
big feller that had some of the makins of
his farm on his boots and pants as material

he seemed to enjoy the exercise


the railroad mans magazine

evidence of his callin and then he locks the
door

    when we made the stop at east cleve-
land this farmer feller piles out and lopes
up to the front platform just as we was a
pullin out the con gets wise and goes up
to present his compliments and extend him a
cordial invite to come on inside out of the
draft fearin hed ketch cold or fall off

pleasant for mr farmer

  but the big guy jest returns the compli-
ments an extends his invite to the kid con
to come out and git him with the comfortin
assurance that if he did hed take him by the
nape of the trousers and the seat of his coat-
collar and smear him along the passin
scenery but the con being jest newly mar-
ried and havin a decent regard for his pros-
pective widow had the good judgment to let
him alone for a while

   however when we stops at mentor he
hikes up ahead and unbosoms himself of a
plan to make it pleasanter for mr farmer
to ride some where else and being young
and foolish i takes it like a trout goin up
for a fly i was to see that the gent got a
shower-bath along with his airin bill cops
the spirit of the thing and he bawls out of
the cab-winder

    hey dave  says he solemn as a
owl  youve got to wet down that coal agin
its too dry they didnt git enough water
on it down at the yards an see that you soak
her up good itll soak up a lot o water

liquid persuasion

      all right billy says i  that coal-
binll be a swimmin when i git through with
it and as soon as we pulled out i begins
drawing water in three buckets and sloshing
it up over the coal over is a good word too
for mighty few drops hit the coal bein swept
back by the draft and landin against the
end of the front car i was real careful to
hit the center so shed slash out both ways
and git that chap wherever he was and i
dont believe a bucket fire-brigade could have
kept a steadier stream of water runnin over
the back of that tender than i did

     i expected to see the cuss come up over
the end any minute and if he had id a begun
a heavin coal at him instead o water but
he had some class to his way o reasonin
knowin hed be out of his element on that
jigglin swayin tender so he takes his bath
like a perfect gentleman

      i concluded if he didnt vacate soon as
we reached the painsville water-stand id git
the spout goin full and then swing it on him
an jest naturally drown him out-the which
i did as soon as i could git it swung round
for he was still there soaked to the skin and
a cussin the best he knew how and his edu-
cation in that line hadnt been neglected

     that flood o wetness was too much for
him arid finally he hops off but i was
laughin so hard i lost track o him till i
heard the coal rattlin and looks round jest
as he grabs me gives me a jiu-jitsu lands
me face down on the water-table with one
hand pinned across my back and him a strad-
dle of my boiler then that cuss yanks the
spout inboard disconnects the canvas apron
so it could spread some and hauls it over
me direct

tit for tat

     i could have stood the water-soakin all
right but he give me a combination in soak-
ins and the way he let fly at me with them
hams hung on the ends of his pile-drivin
arms made my ribs crack and my head roar
like goin through one of them head-on col-
lisions when you git derailed and roll down
a hundred-foot embankment

    but he seemed to enjoy the exercise and
he kept right on never missin a lick and
not neglectin any part of my carcass that he
wasnt sittin on with the torrent from the
stand-pipe burvin us in a slather of water
that washed over and flooded the coal-bin
until my hollerin brought billy and the con
out of the telegraph-office together with a
crowd of passengers when he beat it over
the side of the tender and up the street the
drippin water from his clothes a layin the
dust as he went

      was so pounded up and sore that
seein it were the cons funeral anyway i
made him send one of his brakies up to help
me fire her into erie where i went into the
repair-shop for a week since then ive al-
ways let the other feller play his hand alone
jest as i did to-day its a powerful lot
safer

     well says benny fletcher getherin up
some of his stray runnin-gear thatd got scat-
tered in the openin melee  when it comes
to downright cussed persistence that guy
didnt have much on a red-headed farmer
that we hung a job up on out on the mo-
non back in the early eighties but the
beatin-up prize was drawed by the farmer in
this game
joys of the railroad joker



    he was a husky gingerbread-headed
hoosier that lived up the line near conners-
ville he owned a farm big as all out-doors
and he had a big herd of cows that he made
a great mess of butter from every week hed
ship it down to cincinnati market together
with several barrels of dressed chickens and
on a certain day regular hed have about a

tiredof him so to make a short tun of him
we framed up a fake express robbery for his
special benefit the run before the one we
was to pull it off on we spent our off time
in the express-car swappin yarns about all
the desperate hold-ups wed ever heard of
and some we hadnt the subject bein intro-
duced by bob the messenger sayin as how

wagon-load of the stuff goin down on the
midnight express

hanging a job on a hoosier

  he was one of them close-fisted sus-
picious geezers and he insisted on ridin in
the express-car-the which hed somehow got
permission to do-for the reason as how he
said he once had a pound of butter stole out
of one of his packin-cases by some wicked
thievin express-messenger and he wouldnt
let his eyes off his stuff no more till he saw
it safe in the market-stalls

  he made himself a regular bloomin
nuisance in the car and we all got right well

theyd recently been a darin hold-up on the
line that the officials was keepin quiet about
in hopes of catchin the robbers and he nat-
urally felt kind of creepy himself

    the old guy sets in close with his mouth
open and swallows the whole rope showin
by his nervous actions that he was goin to
be easy money when the game was called

the hold-up

    it didnt kill him off for on his next trip
in he hands us the pleasure of his company
as usual and so havin the cards all stacked
we played the brace-game as per schedule

 wed tipped off a bunch of the boys

that defy was a signal
for allthe lads with
long gun-barrels


the railroad mans magazine

whod be layin over and whod rathej have
a liand in a little rough-house than eat and
they dead-headed to liberty on the up-train

and stowed themselves on the front platform
ready for the attack

    bob was just tellin confidential-like
that his cash-box was plumb full of money
and he was restin easier because we was
nearin the end of the run when there comes
a loud poundin rap at the end door up front

    give us credit for bein duly scared and
makin a noise like a man shiverin in his
shoes when bob puts on a bold front and
opens the door only to jump back and throw
up his hands as a old blunderbuss that might
have been handed down by the puritan fa-
thers was poked in through the door followed
by about a dozen of the boys dressed like
regulation train-robbers carryin a collection
of antique firearms you wouldnt see on ex-
hibition outside a museum and that couldnt
have got a bullet out of its system without a
corkscrew

   it was sure a fierce-lookin gang and
we all acted the part of discretion by tryin to
git a strangle hold on the man in the moon
without unjointin our arms
-all but the farmer man

   seems like he wasnt
educated in the social eddi-
ket of hold-ups and gun-
play he sights the mas-
querade procession mutters
something onreligious- that
his kickin brindle cow was
probly familiar with makes
a grab for the ax in the
emergency-box falls back in
good order to his pile of
stuff where he stands ready
to protect it makin a pic-
ture thatd pass for ajax a
defyin the lightnin

    that defy was the sig-
nal for all the lads with
long gun-barrels to uncouple
from the main train sand
the track a bit slack ahead
and git busy switchin the
old geezer round the freight-
yard promiscus and uncere-
monious and they did

  after gittin the ax
away from him they went to
it in relays and in a friendly
sort of spirit give him a gen-
tlemanly beatin up that had
farmer bricktop yellin for
brakes before half of em
had a chance to take a wal-
lop at him of course they
didnt do any permanent
damage to his machinery that wasnt the
play but they did give him a round-fisted
massawge from his knees to his collar-bone
that made him a durned sight sorer than
when he had that pound of butter stole

     no children concludes benny after a
pause  if thats what you wanted to know
that old carrot-top always thereafter rode
back in the regular cars like the other white
folks and he never made any complaint about
bein robbed either although some of us
could bear witness that he made mighty fine
butter and that them there springers of his
was right good eatin broiled or fried

    never knew before ben that you ever
run on the  monon  and we all looks
around surprised to see the division superin-
tendent leanin against the door-jamb hat in
one hand nibblin a real cigar

     but ive been listenin to your story and
joys of the railroad joker



it proves it says he  for i knew that same
old shag-headed hoosier orchis twin-brother

the supers story

     back in the summer of  i think it
was he continued takin a seat in the circle
like he was one of us  i was a tr-ain-news-
boy then and had a run in with the same or
another sorrel-topped farmer of that town
he worked a con game on me

    being the first train up in the forenoon
there was a good sale for the cincinnati
morning papers on my first run i hopped
off at connersville took my stand by the car-
steps and handed out papers as fast as i
could pocket the nickels

    this guy with corduroys tucked in his
boot-tops stood back of the crowd until the
engineer got the high-ball and had em on
the first turn-over when he rushes up wavin
his hands at me and hollerin for an en-
quirer which i handed him and he pokes it
in his pocket then he begins to dig in his
clothes for the nickel and lie kept diggin and
mutterin something about never bein able to
find his change when he wanted it until the
front of the last car was up and i was pre-
parin to grab the last steps when he flashed
a wad of bills as big as a smoke-stack and
sings out to me as i swung aboard 

      sorry kid i aint got no change now
but ill pay you when you come back 

    i was green enough to expect that he
would for my confidence in human nature
those days stood about like the mercury out-
side around the hundred-degree mark its
down around the-frost-line noy

   i saw him nearly every morning after
that but he bought his papers off the local
boy and when finally i asked him for my
nickel he was always  durned sorry son but
i aint got no change about me jest now

    one day i asked a native and he told
me the old skinflint ran a dairy and poultry
farm which was just across the tracks from
a saw-mill plant up the road a few miles
where there was a loading-switch

   i had told the crew about the incident
and then forgot it until one day we backed
in on the mill-switch to let a special pass
and i spied a flock of his chickens scratching
around on the edge of a sawdust pile

     just then billy the baggage-man pokes
his head out and yells

     theres your chance butch to collect
your arrears on subscriptions from that old
scalawag-and dont forgit theres ten of us
in the crew and we all like chickens 

    then j ake sang out from the engine-
cab a young rooster for mine and jack
mills the front brakeman let me know that
he liked any kind of poultry just so it was
chicken

  but i didnt need their urging to stir
into action the resentful spirit of the kid that
was buttoned inside my shirt-bosom and i
was soon maneuvering to get the flock into a
corner where i begun grabbing at yellow-
legs with both hands one leg to a chicken
and in no time i had half a dozen in each
hand and was beating it for the baggage just
as the train started out

    but pretty soon there was two sprinters
running for that car and one of them was
the red-headed guy that had beat me out of
the price of a morning paper he yelled

     hey - hey - hey stop - thems
my chickens  i want my pay for em 
durned sorry old man i said as
jack give me a helping hand to get aboard
with my load

    then i poked my head around the cor-
ner of the car as he come puffing along hope-
lessly beaten and shouts at him i aint got
no change about me just now and then i
added  but ill pay you when i come back 
which i never did for i asked for a transfer
and took a run on another line out of the same
depot

  and he concluded chuckin a cigar-
butt in the big sawdust cuspidor  i never felt
overburdened with any serious promptings to
send that old duffed any conscience-money
either-and more than that i dont think
that i ever will

    well says benny  he sure was the
same identical individual for he told us that
same story plumb like you told it a goin
down one night-only he omitted to say he
stole anything from you-bein as he told us
a  pillar in die church and i got to thinkin
that if the institutions props was all of the
same worm-eaten holler material the whole
shebang would have tumbled down a right
smart spell ago

b b the weather wizard

by emmet f haitte

honk and horace have an inning
with a pensive prognosticator who
was anything but a hail fellow

b carew was his name
we called him b b which is
the next thing to a  short
he was the incumbent of val-
hallas new weather-station a
meteorological expert presuma-
bly but-well lets not begin in such a
hurry

  you know we were having quite an in-
flux of agriculturists around valhalla-
small-fruiters truck-patchers melon-raisers
and sugar-beeters-all sorts of versatile and
diversified farmers

  they bought and put in operation a large
number of farm garden and orchard ven-
tures of from five to fifty acres new ones
were coming in steadily prospects were
bright so honk set up a yelp for a weather-
station

  he wanted daily bulletins flags dis-
played wind-testers hourly prognostications
and everything so the untutored hoe-push-

ers in the vicinity could tell when to plow
when to plant and when to take a day off
for a picnic a worthy project if it would
work as i heartily agreed

  honk took it up with dade die general
immigration agent of our road dade
squealed to the p and p management and
they put the proposition up to uncle samuel
the humble movement growing like a cu-
mulus cloud on a humid day finally blew
us up something definite in the shape of
basil b carew accompanied by two pack-
ing-cases of skycological and windographical
instruments

  he came fresh from his civil - service
exam a round-headed youngish man but
uppish-ouch mister

  he had an arrogant confidence in himself
that was impressive he opened up on the
top floor of our tallest four-story heaven-
towering building where- he could see any
old kind of weather in any direction ten or
fifteen minutes before the rest of us plodders
down nearer the ground had a chance at it

  he strung up his little row of pennants
on a pole stuck up a whirligig or two set
out his barometer thermometer and chro
nometer unpacked his rubber-stamp printing
outfit and got busy with his prophecies

  honk is an enthusiast on any subject ex-
cept matrimony and buying tobacco im
not so much so im more conservative i
once forked for a year or so in missouri
anyhow when we got our weather-station
honk was mightily tickled

   a fine thing for our people horace he
said that first day the bureau started up
he was peeking through the end window of
the medicine-house at the fluttering flags
while speaking now the boys can tell
when its going to frost when its going to
be hot and dry or when well have rain or
b b the weather wizard



hail see that little strip of rag zipping in
the breeze that represents the supremacy
of mind-the triumph of thought

  while man cannot as yet harness and
guide the elements the vagrant winds the
tumbling clouds he can feel the pulse of
em and say to a certainty whence they come
whither they go and why

  science my boy science is the key
take away science and where would you be
to-day dressed in the pelt of a goat
delving with a pointed rock in the earth for
beetles or angleworms to stay your hunger
horace thats where youd be

  i cleared my throat for a fitting reply to
this sally but honk did not wait for it

   lcfan me a small chew will you   he
requested hungrily what do you think
of the new weather man anyhow

   hes not impressed with us as much as
he is with himself i said when he
talks to me he seems to think im just a
little fat dub who dont know very much
about machinery i asked him if he looked
for warm weather in august but he never
cracked a smile

  he said  in the event of normal pres-
sures throughout this district and with as
is usual a low percentage of precipitation
we may reasonably expect maximum tem-
peratures of ninety degrees fahrenheit or
even higher what do you think of that
why couldnt he have said  i should snick-
er itll be hottern blazes and been done
with it its all a guess anyhow he
neednt take himself so seriously

  i beg leave to differ with you said
honk its not a guess for instance
the flags say now  rain and colder and
if you look out you will see that theres not
a cloud in the sky thats where science
has the bulge on mere haphazard guessing

  your goose-bone prophets look up and
see a big black cloud and say its going to
rain when its clear with no wind and
the thermometer stands at twenty - eight
they guess its going to frost

   thats where weve got the edge over
em we know before it gets here its the
difference between the drilled soldier and
the rabble between the repeating-rifle and
the pea-shooter the electric furnace and the
dobe oven no guesswork about it my
dear horace

  on the strength of the prediction of  rain
and colder he phoned over to a sewer-con-
struction gang telling the foreman to knock
off ditching that day and get the cement
under shelter in view of the cloudless sky

and the bright sunshine the gang probably
thought him crazy with the heat but theirs
was not to reason why so they followed in-
structions

  about five - thirty a dark - green cloud
rolled up from the west and it rained a
regular gully-washer winding up with hail
as big as cantaloupes-that is small canta-
loupes you understand not muskmelons
when it quit hailing it was cold enough for
ear-muffs

  honk just about swelled up to the ex-
ploding-point with that he wanted to de-
clare a half holiday get out the populace
and have a parade in honor of the successful
outcome of the prediction

  great he said there you are
quod chat demonstrandum the vindication
of scientific methods never let me hear you
quibble again keep your eye on the sig-
nals and youll never go astray if you
dont see it on the bulletins it aint going to
happen thats all and other i-told-you-so
palaver of the same sort it was his inning

  i accompanied honk next day when he
went up to gas with the weather man b b
didnt seem to feel flippant he was just
taking the pulse of the elements and noting
it down on a chart that looked like the rise
and fall of the price of wheat since 
zigzag lines arrows dots and circles made
with red ink honk rubbed his hands and
smirked

    fine stuff he said admiringly  great
doings whats on the menu for to-day

   cloudy with variable winds shifting to
the east said b b like a poll-parrot

   that means more rain said honk

- i didnt say so said b b curtly i
said cloudy with variable winds shifting to
the east

   i heard you said honk  hows
your chewing we came up to congratulate
you on yesterdays prediction it was the
warm article right on the dot

  friend b b refused to beam

   our system is very comprehensive and
dependable he said with a bored air
the possibility of error is quite remote
the united states weather bureau has
passed beyond the stage of mere conjecture

   just what i told horace here bubbled
honk he is something of a doubting

  b b looked over by and through me
as if i was some kind of a worm he made
no comment insects and vermin had noth-
ing to do with the weather

electric heater i said to honk  it seems
chilly up here b-r-r-r 

   i thank you ill have no need of it
said b b  i think ill be able to manage
besides if i should require any additional
furnishings the government attends to all
detail of that character please do not han-
dle the instruments gentlemen

  honk and i withdrew this weather man
was an unresponsive kind of a hail-fellow
he struck me as a little bit sleety with a
raw wind accompanying

  now will you stand hitched i asked
after we had made our escape never
monkey with the band-wagon unless you can
play the oom-pah

   the young man is nervous and excited
naturally said honk  he isnt adjusted
yet he is in a new environment unfamil-
iar surroundings andall that and probably
our brusk western camaraderie shocks him
you cant blame him for that

  i didnt i forgot all about him for the
next two or three days the crappie were
biting too well for me to worry about b b
until one noontime my attention was called
to the new weather bureau by honk who
was comparing the code with certain signals
displayed above the observatory he was
muttering to himself

   a white flag with a black triangle
above it means fair and warmer hes had

em up like that for thirty-six hours and
its spitting snow with the wind in the north-
west say horace that weather man has
got switched off into a blind siding come
here and see how you get it

  i cast the horoscope

  fair and warmer i said shivering it
had commenced to rain-a cold driving
rain-and the wind was yowling honk
shook his head

   i cant see into no such a forecast as
that he said

   he means to-morrow i suggested

   he had the same ones up all day yester-
day

   then its for day after to-morrow i
declared

  b b kept his fair and warmer signals
di-splayed until it did turn fair and warmer
however that was a week later we had
all sorts of cold rain biting winds sleet and
slush in the meantime

  on the day it moderated and the sun came
out again b b yanked down his white flag
and black triangle and hoisted his blue with
a black-centered white above it we grabbed
our code list and found that we were in for
a cold wet wave ill say this however
it was the warmest and dryest cold wet
wave i ever saw a regular chinook

  then ensued a carnival of weather peo-
ple spoke about it gradually of course

 

honk did the paul re-
vere that afternoon

thunder and lightning or rainfall exces-
sive heat high winds and such other mani-
festations of the fickle atmosphere are com-
mon in their respective seasons

  it takes some time to get the american
public stirred up the people will stand
for a lot and pass it off by saying yes
but this aint a patch on a circus-tent to
what we had in the spring of  or
when i was a boy etc

  valhalla was so comparatively recent that
we hadnt many precedents our oldest set-
tler had only been there the number of years
he could count on the fingers of one hand
and then have counters to spare neverthe-
less it was a revelation to all of em that
festival of weather

  april came in like a lamb cooed like a
dove warbled frolicked raved snarled
chirruped roared and went out like a bull
when he sees a dago washing on a right-of-
way fence

  b b was predicting just as fast as he
could all this time but he couldnt keep in
sight the weather veered so fast he blistered
his hands changing signals he got the
swing of it a little better after a while and
settled down to a routine about two days
behind

  wed have a hot shower with b b main-
taining a strictly cold and dry schedule
then when he got his half-blue and half-
white flag up wecl have a dust-storm

  may came on apace may that had al-
ways been a shy sweet gentle sprite with
her budding and blooming and her busy
bees in the clover but this time she came
with bristles standing out like the quills of a
porcupine snarling and spitting

  only once during the month did we have
a warm spell and that was the week honks
orchard-growers had such a time with their
smudge-pots

 it was the second week in may when our
weather - station fired out frost warnings
 prepare for killing frosts the bulletins
said  cover up the bean-vines and blan-
ket the tomato-plants

  light freezes in the valleys and old hoarv
jack with all his whiskers on the hills was
the dope

  honk was all aswirl with it

   i must get out and carry the news to
every fiend of em he said or some of
the louts are sure to get their fruit prospects
nipped in the bud

  go ahead i said take my bicycle
and enjoy yourself the exercise will do you
good besides helping you

  honk did the paul revere that afternoon
until he was black in the face

   get out your smudges he told em
 build fires between your trees and in your
berry-patches frost predicted for to-night
burn up your old clothes and consign your
furniture to the flames if necessary but save
the fruit men save the fruit

  well they got out and worked all night
a nice warm balmy night it was too with
the moon ogling them and the soft summery
breezes blowing the smoke from the smudges
into their eyes ears and throats

  ardently jdid they labor and every man
imagined that he was staving off the white
blight that would destroy all liis neighbors
crops while his alone would escape no
doubt they figured on what awesome prices
fruit and garden sass would bring when it
had all been killed but their own one little
patch

  toward morning it got so warm that we
had to open the windows of the medicine-
house the entire heavens were darkened
with the smoke from the smudges

   say i said  these guys are heating up
the entire out-of-doors with their frost pre-
ventives its warm enough to hatch flies
outside

  honk looked out and sniffed at the com-
bination smells

  fact he said if this keeps up ill
have to shuck my flannel

   its almost warm enough for you to take
your annual bath i remarked

  the heat was no mere figure of speech i
suspected that i might be called upon in aft-
er years to stir the fancy of some reminiscent
group of weather-sharks with the data of
how many degrees persistent smudging could
raise the frosty air of night so i dug out a
thermometer and hung it outside within
fifteen minutes it registered  which is
what i call smudging some

  b b kept his frost warnings uppermost
for five days during which period it got as
hot as  in the shade in the afternoons
the fruit men got tired of smudging and
dropped out one by one to keep fires go-
ing in the face of summer heat requires
more than blind faith it is too much like
work

  we heard mutterings and scpffings round
about a pair of ex-smudgers who came to
the freight-room for some small consignment
or other said to me-

  wheres that long hungry who came out
on a bicvcle to give us the bum steer about

honks teeth clattered together like a compressed-air riveter

   hes down in the south end to-day see-
ing after some paving i said truthfully

   him or somebody needs fixing in the
hay-loft they said why this weather-
bureau business is the worst frost weve had
around here does anybody pay out money
to keep up a joke-works like that weather
bureau  

   they do i said decidedly  its main-
tained by the government and its very ex-
pensive and elaborate the system has been
brought to its present high standard of ex-
cellence by the expenditure of immense sums
of money for experiments and the employ-
ment of the best brains in the country to
perfect the work

  and it dont amount to shucks they

said still unconvinced whats-them flags
up there mean now

 colder with rain or snow i trans-
lated

they gazed at the flags at the flood of
golden sunlight at the heat dancing along
the earth in all directions at the blue vault
of sapphire sky and they snickered one to
the other i told honk about it when he
came home to dinner that night

    let them have their
 fun he said  science
 has been jeered at all down
 through the pig - headed
 ages mankind is the most
 ungrateful animal that
 runs at large anyhow he
 gives no credit for the hits
 but hes always ready to ki-
 yi at the misses

   honk had been planning
 a jaunt into the hills for
 the purpose of locating a
 dam site-no profanity in-
 tended

   he had in mind another
 big reservoir and reclama-
 tion project at the last
 moment i took a notion to
 accompany him seeing it
 was saturday afternoon
 and sunday wasnt a very
 busy day

   it was a pretty ardu-
 ous trip through canons
 rocky trails and bad lands
 -not very far only about
 thirty miles but unhandy
 we hadnt got macadam
 driveways built in the
 mystic hills yet

    ill get the ponies while you fix ug up a
lunch honk said well ride out take
a few measurements size up things and
come back by moonlight itll be poetic

     if it doesnt storm i said

 ill drop in at the observatory and get
the dope he said  if theres anything
doing b b will have it on his chart

 honk cantered up leading my mount in
half an hour it was a bright balmy buoy-
ant and altogether blithesome may day

 leave the medicine-house all open he
suggested  it needs a good airing hang
the bedding out the windows nothing will
bother em and the weather observations say
continued warm and dr b b took a spe-
cial reading for me well have a dry wave
b b the weather wizard



  i went back after my slicker at that honk
refused to take his and made remarks be-
sides

  we got to our destination about 
the dam site was within a hundred yards of
where honk had expected it to be he meas-
ured calculated set stakes figured levels
computed thicknesses and lengths and other
idiosyncrasies while i jotted down the re-
sults in a note-book in my fine copper-plate
handwriting

  we became hungry ate our sandwiches
admired the view and took chews from my
plug

  about sundown we started on the poetic
return trip it was sultry presently a cloud
gathered from nowhere in particular and it
began to thunder and growl like all the sun-
dogs were on our trail it was just a step
from that to wind and rain then fire and
water engulfed us the earth rocked the
trail melted the air turned to spray honks
hat blew up-that is off and up about two
hundred feet in the air took its bearings
and sailed about a mile across the canon

  i apologized to honk and donned my

what would the department of agriculture say if i gave you a
playful kick in the slats

slicker it wasnt a passing shower not by
six hours it kept on even after honk was
thoroughly wetted and liell never be any
wetter in this world

  it was a cold rain too honks teeth
clattered together like a compressed-air rivet-
er until he began to feel aggrieved-which
he did ultimately

  tk-tk-tk-tk he said whatd that-tk-
tk weird ass of a tk-tk weather man mean by
tk-tk-tk saying it wouldnt rain

   hes a wag i suggested  a p-funny
man he was joshing

  ill josh him castanetted honk ill
josh the tk-tk-tk block off of him

   mankind never gives credit for the hits
i remarked  but is always ready to ki-yi
at the misses

   do you want to be flung over a preci-
pice   threatened tlonk

  so soon as he got well angered his tem-
perature rose and he was warm the rest of the
journey i have noted that fact for the bene-
fit of arctic explorers icemen and others

then the world turned
upside down

  the storm abated soon after we sloshed
into the medicine-house at  am our
quarters were well soaked the only things
that had escaped a drenching were the in-
sides of the electric-light bulbs

  honk raved and raged i sat wrapped in
my slicker and listened i wondered if he
would touch on every phase of the situation
before he ran down i believe he did
some he touched twice-and with a rare
eloquence and biting sarcasm

  he blamed the whole thing even to the
loss of his hat on little round-headed con-
ceited b b

  it was no fleeting rankle either he was
still savage next day we hunted up the
unfortunate prognosticator and honk told
him about it

  youre a false alarm you are sneered
honk  what you dont know about weather
conditions would keep a book-publi slier
busy for a thousand years a wiseacre you
are a sage and a seer i dont think if i
had your head id waste no time with
weather id travel with a side-show a
freak thats what you are you-you-

  ahem interrupted b b bristling
your tone is offensive sir the depart-
ment of agriculture does not encourage the

idle criticism of its representatives by this
or that upstart good day sir 

wait a minute you four-flusher
shouted honk what would the de-
partment of agriculture say if i tweaked
your nose for you or gave you a playful
kick in the slats shut up dont sass
me why-why do you know who youre
talking to  

but b b walked away ungraciously
without waiting to hear who honk was
or seeming to care particularly about it
anyhow

   honk plunged with
 fervor into the task of
 getting b b elimi-
 nated from valhalla
 a proposition not so
 simple as he thought

   he wrote to the
 home office first set-
 ting forth a string of
 complaints that took
 eight cents to for-
 ward after a due
 lapse of time he got
 an answer a sort of
 printed slip stating
 that his charges
 would be investigated 
 in regular alphabet-
 ical order

 they advised him to keep perfectly calm
in the meantime take no rubber money in
payment of bills eschew worry live within
his means and to bear in mind that the mills
of the gods were too large to do any three-
hundred-revolutions-a-minute stunts all of
which was signed with a rubber stamp

 impatient honk took the matter up with
dade with the p and p with the senators
from our state members of the house of
representatives and even threatened to
write to the president himself

 while all this was going on b b dis-
played his flags issued his bulletins and
concocted strange pathetic predictions to
suit his own whims an odd genius was b

b	what the weather actually turned out to
be in the end didnt interfere with his work
in the least his observations were separate 
and apart

 if the local rain flag needed an airing he
aired it sunny days preferred if he thought
we needed snow snow he predicted may or
no may

 he branched out too pretty soon got
him a lot of new instruments which he in-

stalled with gusto one day a big box came
for him by express and not long thereafter
valhalla was stirred by the sight of a cap-
tive balloon tethered to the roof of the ob-
servatory b b was going to be a scientist
for true

  he anchored his balloon with a block and
pulley attachment so he could pull her down
climb into the basket and take his skycome-
ter up four or five hundred feet where he
could observe and potter around discovering
weather never before dreamed of

  the turmoil of weather and false proph-
ecy continued it was a record-breaker for
valhalla that spring blazing hot days
jerked the fruit-buds into blossom and
freezes followed which killed the leaves on
the trees

  it was weather that no smudges could
combat when all the vegetables were nipped
down to the ground it would turn warm
for a few minutes rain change to sleet end
in snow and freeze up again

  june arrived with hot flashes and an omi-
nous calm the first day of june was a
smuggy underwear-sticky day and so hot
you could taste it too hot to woyk too
hot to play

  honk and i sat on the shady side of the
medicine-house all afternoon of that day
with our tongues lolling cut panting at
two oclock it was bad at three worse and
at four we gasped and swore we couldnt
stand it a minute longer without help

  look at that weather-pimple wheezed
honk  hes up in his balloon trying to
locate a cold snap look at those signals
he sneered high winds and unsettled
faugh and not a leaf stirring fan me
or i perish 

  at that moment a dull droning sound vi-
brated in the air we were so nearly stifled
we didnt pay much attention to it at first
the droning grew to a murmur honk sat

up sweating with the exertion and cocked
his ear to listen

  whats that roaring he asked

   its the high winds predicted i said
hold on to your hat

  he dragged himself to the end of the car
for a reconnaisance

  man he said theres a cloud com-
ing up and its coming buzzing

  it was from the southwest a big tum-
bling black funnel with a flying frothy
spume scudding before it

   a jimmycane  i yelled  dig for cover
under the coach and hang on to the rails 

   look at that fool weather man  shout-
ed honk he had to shout for the whistling
roar was upon us  he dont know enough
to go in when it rains 

  then the world turned upside down all
the fireworks in the universe exploded ten
million dogs howled and yelped and a bil-
lion wild horses galloped across valhalla
ever hear the screaming high-keyed siren
of a tornado excuse me i dont care for it

  it dont waste no time with you though
if it dont get your meat-house the first
swipe youre safe it is gone

  i unhooked myself from the rails where
i might have been cut in two by the medi-
cine-house if the wind had shifted her-
but it hadnt-and looked for honk he
crawled up out of the ditch muddy and
disheveled but intact

  finally the rain slackened with one ac-
cord we looked toward the observatory
honk and i it wasnt there any more
neither was the balloon

  honk gouged a large chunk of mud out
of his left ear stared at me in solemn silence
for a moment and then said huskily

   hes gone

  well i said he made good before
he left anyhow he predicted high winds
and unsettled

tree blocks trains two days

  a giant red fir-tree standing on the west
  slope of the cascade mountains was re-
  cently blown down falling across the tracks of the
  northern pacific railroad where it blocked traffic
  for two days its monster trunk measured nine
  feet in diameter and as there was no saw in that
  part of the country large enough to cut through it
  and chopping would require many days the wreck-
  ing crew set to work to dynamite it

  a number of auger holes were bored into it and
these filled with dynamite the explosion splin-
tered the trunk to such an extent that it could be
removed and also tore up the track for some dis-
tance

  the rebuilding of the roadbed however was
considered but a small task as compared to the re-
moval of the tree by other means than dynamite

                  they had a baby doll for waitress at the next place on the line
                  a brakie told us all this giddy news

    one freiglit-train crew entire had gone raving mad about her-

                  she could marry any one of them shed choose

                  she was pretty she was witty her figure was a dream

                   but brakie checkers said  shes not my style 

    just by that we knew hed lost out but we never said a word-

                 only handed him a sympathetic smile

                  in two days by the calendar the  dream  was sent to us

                 because shed scrapped with every one up there

                  she was painted powdered made-up and fourteen dollars worth
                  of puffs and dangle curls adorned her hair

    she passed the other hashers like a pay-train would a tramp

                  the manager was dealt a haughty grin

                  we could see she thought she owned the place shed come to settle down
                  just brought along her charm-strings and moved in 

                  could she work she scrubbed the counter off she tidied up the shelves
                  and took a dozen orders in a flash

    took them she didnt bring them in please to understand

                 bluffing was her forte-not slinging hash

                  she told the boss to  go sit down and rest your face and hands 
                  believe me there was class to her for fair

    she ordered all the girls about and called the chef a  chink

                  because he joshed her once about her hair

                                   

    we thought the boys all liked her and she liked all the boys-

                   thats the reason that we stood for so much sass

why the steam-locomotive
will stay

by robert h rogers

there is a wide-spread impression that electricity is in a fair way to suc-
ceed steam on railroads not only in suburban and terminal service but
for general trunk-line requirements as well and that the passing of the
steam-locomotive to a berth with the cable-car in the hall of antiquities cannot
be delayed much longer

    the truth recorded in this article about the electric locomotive seems to
render the above conclusion largely fallacious in view of the very slight ground
which exists for its foundation it is unfortunate that the peace of mind of rail-
road men should be at all disturbed

    this is not unnatural however as there is much loyalty to ideals and tra-
ditions in the ranks of railroad men it amounts almost to a spirit of resentment
toward the innovation and added to it is a feeling of uneasiness over what must
follow in the wake of such a drastic revolution in motive-povver

some very good reasons why the controller-handle will never take the
place of the throttle-lever in main-line railroad
operation in america

has been feared by engineers since
the introduction of the electric
motor into railroading that the
dignity which has now become as-
sociated with their part in steam
traction will largely disappear
and with it a reduction in wages to the scale
now paid motomien on interurban lines
firemen on the other hand are concerned
over the probability that they will be rele-

gated from their present position of impor-
tance to that of helper or  second man on
the motors also with reduced compensation

  if such a possibility as a general electri-
fication of railroads now operating by steam
should materialize it would affect many
more than these two classes of railroad men
it would in fact completely disrupt division
and shop organization as it is now consti-
tuted


the railroad mans magazine

  the engineers and firemen however have
in reality much less to fear than the men in
the shops for in localities where electric
main-line traction is in evidence it has been
demonstrated that the road men can be
readily adapted to the new order of things
but it is extremely doubtful if places could
be found for the present roundhouse hands

unlikely changes

  the electric locomotive has little in com-
mon with the steam-engine so far as main-
tenance is concerned it has no cylinder pack-
ing to renew no flues to calk no valves to
set no staybolts to cut out nor steam-pipe
joints to grind the boilermakers would
practically disappear from the roundhouse
and the present work of the machinist would
be so modified as to be unrecognizable all
of the minor occupations such as flue and
ash-pan cleaners grate repairers brick-arch
men boiler-washers and many others would
have to be eliminated from the shop organi-
zation

  in place of these time-honored standbys
there would necessarily arise an army of
mechanics now largely unheard of in rail-
road work to cope with entirely different re-
pair conditions and whose ranks might be
scanned in vain for any of the old guard ex-
cept possibly the air-brake inspector box-
packer and turntable man

  all this however is merely idle conjec-
ture because there is scarcely a remote prob-
ability of trunk-line electrification these
bugbears are mentioned because they have
been bothering railroad men ever since the
first electric locomotive succeeded in pulling
a train on a steam railroad and because
there is no worry akin to the lear that comes
to one whose lifes work is menaced

  as the title of this article implies it is
intended to be reassuring to those who look
for sudden changes in railroad operation
with that end in view it may be best pre-
faced with a few timely statistics these in-
dicate that  locomotives were built in
 and although this total is less than in
former years it nevertheless shows a heal-
thy addition to the total steam rolling-stock
of the country

  though the size and hauling capacity of
locomotives continues to steadily increase
every year the outlook for  points to at
least  engines through their greater
development these will easily equal in power
the  produced in the banner year 

the mere mention of statistics indicating

a revival in locomotive building is far from
being the compelling argument for the con-
tinuance of steam traction the real augury
for its future can best be made after a careful
review of what has been actually accom-
plished with the electric engine and of the
prominent features associated with its cost
of installation and comparative performances

  not until recently have these figures been
available for consideration as the various
motive-power chiefs have been occupied in
their tabulation covering a very long period
and because they have hesitated to commit
themselves one way or the other besides
these causes of delay the presentation of
such statistics has not been forthcoming for
the very natural reason that there were few
to offer

  with very few exceptions the railroads
not deceived by the optimistic claims and the
enthusiasm which greeted the electric loco-
motive have largely preferred to play a wait-
ing game the general policy was to let
somebody else take the initiative and make
the mistakes inseparable from any such dras-
tic and costly metamorphosis

a pioneer in electrification

  for a long time the baltimore and ohio
railroad which has been the pioneer in
heavy electric traction was very closely
scrutinized and there is little doubt that
what happened there largely dictated the
policy of other roads in going to electrifica-
tion this road in  through the latter
medium began the operation of all passenger
and freight trains from camden station via
the new  belt-line  tunnel under the city of
baltimore to its northern limits a distance
of about two miles

  this departure was on a scale of startling
magnitude for the times as it implied the
complete surrender of the steam motive-
power in the territories mentioned

  the details of the experiment had been
planned with exacting care and it was won-
derfully successful almost from the first day
those early motors handled with ease the
heaviest freight-trains including always the
engines of the latter which were of no assist-
ance as they were not allowed to use steam
in the tunnel

  although the records are somewhat hazy
the writers notes gathered during active

least one per cent and this train would prob-
ably have required the two locomotives to

slow progress

  the electric locomotives weighed one hun-
dred tons each and in view of the fact that
they were built with each of their four axles
directly driven the total weight was avail-
able for adhesion excepting a few improve-
ments which time has brought about in elec-
tric-locomotive construction these pioneer
motors differed but slightly in general build
and appearance from those now in service

  with the exception of the electrification of
the manhattan elevated railroad formerly
a steam road with about thirty-eight miles
of track traversing new york city this two-
mile stretch of the baltimore and ohio re-
mained for a long time the only example of
main-line traction operated wholly by elec-
tricity in which steam had been supplanted

  although admittedly successful and thor-
oughly economical this line was too short
for any definite conclusions as to the real
value of such an equipment hence little
progress was made during the ensuing eight
years up to 

  during this interval there was a notable
extension of electricity to municipal and
suburban lines particularly to city cable-
roads but this work has no bearing on what
has been done toward changing trunk-line
traction from steam to electricity and the
effect of the change on steam-railroad em-
ployees

  while operating practically alone in an
unexplored field the baltimore and ohio
effectually developed the fact that electricity
affords the only real solution of the locomo-
tive smoke problem in large cities its belt-
line tunnel would probably never have come
into being had not the advocates of the new
power made it clear to the city of baltimore
that with it the general train service would
be clean and noiseles

solving the smoke problem

  the full realization of these two pleasing
features eventually inclined the new york
municipality to the consideration of a similar
system to be effected in that city for relief
from the smoke arising from the engines of
the new york central and the new york
new haven and hartford railroads both of
which use the park avenue tunnel between
the grand central station and eighty-ninth
street

  when the agreement was entered into be-
tween the city of new york and the new
york central lines it called only for the
operation of trains by electricity through the
park avenue tunnel but the railroad com-
pany from a broad standpoint concluded
that the electric traction should be extended
to embrace not only the remainder of its
passenger lines in new york city lying to
the north of the tunnel but also extending
out into westchester county for a distance
of from twenty-five to thirty miles from the
grand central terminal

  in reaching this conclusion it was also
decided that the safety of the public be bet-
ter guarded by the elimination of grade-
crossings in the cities and towns along its
right-of-way in almost every instance the
local governments cooperated with this poli-
cy but regardless of the strenuous efforts
of all concerned the proposed improvements
north of the limits of greater new york
came to a standstill because of the lack of
unity between the railroad and the board of
railroad commissioners

why electrification fails

  consequently the new york central was
temporarily forced to fix the northerly limits
of its electric zone at high bridge on the
hudson division and wakefield on the har-
lem division seven and thirteen miles re-
spectively from the grand central terminal
this interruption to the companys plans
occurred in  and many adjustments
have since been made the ultimate termini
will be at croton or peekskill on the hud-
son division and north white plains on the
harlem division

  the new york new haven and hartford
railroad being a tenant of the new york
central between woodlawn and new york
a distance of about eleven miles was also
forced to provide an electric equipment be-
tween these points but with a similar ex-
pansive policy decided to extend its electric
zone to stamford connecticut thirty-seven
miles from the grand central station which
gives it the longest electrically-operated main
line in the country

  so much for what has been done in trunk-
line electrification since the baltimore and
ohio broke the ice in  the grand
total of less than one hundred miles of road
not of track converted from steam to
electricity in fifteen years should not occa-
sion any particular alarm to the men of the
steam roads


the railroad mans magazine

  this mileage does not include unimpor-
tant steam lines which may have been con-
verted in that period although there are very
few even of these most of them were trans-
formed into trolley roads and the change has
no bearing on trunk-line conditions

  the cost incidental to converting this in-
significant number of miles to electric trac-
tion has been enormous it is doubtful if
 would cover it in the aggregate
these were old railroads well organized
and thoroughly equipped with steam require-
ments

heavy cost of installation

  the change they made compelled them to
take on a vast number of skilled mechanics
hitherto not employed without appreciably
diminishing the ranks of the regular em-
ployees as the percentage of miles electrified
is so small compared with the total railroad
mileage there has been no reduction in the
number of locomotives required and each
road has added materially to its steam equip-
ment since the partial electrification

  this tremendous initial expenditure con-
stitutes the prohibitive feature agairist the
electrification of present-day steam railroads
while there are a few instances in this coun-
try where the change would be permissible
from a financial standpoint in no case would
it be undertaken without the assurance that
an increase in net receipts would follow suf-
ficient to more than pay interest on the extra
capital involved-a condition which is apt to
prove extremely unlikely

  in support of this view the recent com-
ment of president harahan of the illinois
central in a report on the proposed electri-
fication of the suburban service of that
road is of interest

   our suburban traffic is not sufficiently
dense to warrant the expense necessary to
electrify these lines and it is evident that
even under electrification there would not be
an increase in traffic sufficiently large to
offset the annual cost of operation it simply
proves that under present conditions of
steam-railway electrification where it means
the replacement of a plant already installed
it is not justifiable either in whole or in
part

  so far as the density of the traffic in the
above statement is concerned it may be add-
ed that the suburban district of the illinois
central in chicago covers about fifty miles
of road and carries in round numbers
about  suburban passengers every

year an average of  per day or 
in an hour the net revenue of this busi-
ness as at present operated under steam for
the fiscal year ending june   was
 and the estimated net revenue
under electric traction is  a gain
of  in net revenue if electricity
should be installed

  but before this can be realized there must
be an initial outlay of  to cover
the cost of electrification on which the an-
nual interest and depreciation can be safely
reckoned at ten per cent or  a year
deducting from this startling amount the
 saved through electrification the
annual deficit under electrical operation is


  an increase of  per cent in earnings
would not enable the suburban business of
this road to break even should it be elec-
trified if the suburban traffic of the illi-
nois central is not sufficiently dense to
warrant the expense it is hard to see how
it could be undertaken by less prosperous
roads for whose use it has been advocated

executive attitudes

  mr i kruttschnitt is director of mainte-
nance and operation of the harriman lines
-probably the most important railroad posi-
tion in the united states if not in the
world and any opinion of such an incum-
bent must necessarily be carefully weighed
mr kruttschnitt lias this to say regarding
the proposition to electrify the main line of
the central pacific over the sierras

  we have found that it pays to make
haste slowly with regard to innovations
electrification for mountain traffic does not
carry the same appeal that it did two years
ago oil-burning locomotives are solving
the problem very satisfactorily each mal-
let compound having a horse-power in ex-
cess of  hauls as great a load as two
of the former types burning ten per cent less
fuel and using fifty per cent less water

  the pennsylvania railroad must use elec-
tric traction between harrison new jersey
and sunnyside long island in connection
with its new york improvements and will
employ it to that extent on its system but
nevertheless mr a w gibbs its general
superintendent of motive-power is quoted
with the following pessimistic opinion

   the cost of everything electric is tre-
mendous the electric locomotives such as
they are cost more than double the steam-
locomotives which they replace and we must
why the steam-locomotive will stay



add the cost of track preparation of the
power plants and all that goes to make the
electric system as a whole

   the demand has frequently been made
that lines leading into terminals should be
electrified in some cases the same demand
has been made in the case of cities that are
not terminals such a demand would in-
volve two locomotive terminals one on each
side of the city with electrification of the
space within the city limits a supply of
special electric locomotives and the delay
consequent upon a double stop

  to offset the cost of this there is no
saving whatever in operation on the con-
trary the operating cost is largely increased
even if the railroads could stand the bur-
den of cost it is quite certain that the pub-
lic itself would not tolerate unnecessary de-
lays of this kind

expense too great

  naturally the roads hesitate to under-
take new electrifications not only on account
of the expense but also because it is wise
for one railroad to profit by the mistakes of
another and thus avoid costly repetitions

   while anything of the kind is possible
with an unlimited expenditure of money
we do not hesitate to say that the time has
not yet come when such an enormous out-
lay of capital would be justified by the
returns and further we assert that the
capital thus diverted would be used to bet-
ter advantage in other directions

  the boston and albany railroad betrays
little enthusiasm for the project as the fol-
lowing quotation from its report states

   some slight economies might accrue in
transportation expenses under this operation
but these would soon be entirely absorbed
by the additional expenses incurred and the
net saving would be so small as to be almost
inappreciable

  thus run the guarded opinions neverthe-
less of those whose expressions may well be
listened to in the study of the transporta-
tion problem although none of the above
quoted have essayed the experiment it is
quite evident that they have carefully
weighed what has been accomplished and
that they do not consider the game worth the
candle it may be well to briefly review the
experiences of the roads which abandoned
steam for electricity as a motive-power

  in the baltimore and ohio experiment the
end has no doubt justified the means from
every view-point but it should be borne

prominently in mind that this is almost what
might be called a helping service and is
far from the scope exhibited by the new
york central in the city of new york

  the baltimore and ohio motors pull trains
only in one direction up the grade from
camden to mount royal station and return
light for other trains whereas on the former
road the power is expended in each direction
and on a vastly greater volume of traffic
this may serve to partially explain why the
unquestioned good performance of the balti-
more and ohio failed to influence for such a
long period

  following the baltimore and ohio the first
electrified steam road from which any con-
clusion of results may be drawn is the man-
hattan elevated the total cost of its electric
installation was  the operating
expense since the change was made has de-
creased from sixty-one per cent to forty-six
per cent of the gross receipts and its net
results after taking care of the increased
capital etc show fifteen per cent profit

  the significant fact remains however
that the increase in business since electrifi-
cation has been forty-six per cent the sys-
tem now carries  people a year
 a day or  an hour relying
on these figures from published reports it
will be appreciated that forty-six per cent in-
creased business was required to bring about
fifteen per cent reduction in operating ratio

  for another prominent example of elec-
trification and to preserve the sequence it
now becomes necessary to refer to the mersey
tunnel road connecting liverpool and bir-
kenhead england in its four-years report
of electric operation the net profit allowing
interest etc on the increased capital due to
electrification is also shown at fifteen per
cent but it took an increase in traffic of fifty-
five per cent to make this possible

  experiences of the n y n h and h

  there is no doubt that the new york cen-
tral and the new york new haven and
hartford are handling trains more economi-
cally in their respective suburban districts
about new york than they formerly moved
them by steam but the fact remains that to
enable this to happen extremely heavy capi-
tal costs had to be assumed and the charges
on these costs make the entire operating cost
far higher than it used to be in the days of
steam operation

  the new haven road went heavily into
electrification its four-track main-line from


the railroad mans magazine

stamford connecticut to woodlawn new
york about twenty-seven miles represents
the highest development in electric traction
which can be exhibited anywhere in the
world the motors embody a combination of
trolley for the new haven proper and third-
rail contact while on the new york central
from woodlawn into the grand central sta-
tion they cost the company  each
or twice that of a steam-locomotive adequate
for the same service

  besides the heavy outlay for single power
units it requires two of these  elec-
tric engines to handle an express-train of
eight cars on the same schedule which pre-
vailed when steam was in vogue this makes
the capital cost of the motive-power on these
trains at least over  and in connec-
tion with this there must be an interest and
depreciation amounting to  a day

for suburban electrification

  the attitude of the new haven road after
employing electric traction since  may
best be illustrated in the following extract
from a letter written by mr c s mellen
president of that road and which is em-
bodied in a report of the electrical com-
mission of the state of massachusetts

  we believe we are warranted in saying
that our electric installation is a success
from the standpoint of handling the business
in question efficiently and with reasonable
satisfaction and we believe we have arrived
at the point where we can truthfully say that
the interruptions to our service are no greater
nor more frequent than was the case when
steam was in use but we are not prepared
to state that there is any economy in the sub-
stitution of electric traction for steam on the
contrary we believe the expense is very much
greater

  this naturally becomes the most concise
utterance of any heretofore quoted as it is
derived from actual experience with electric
main-line traction although as has been
mentioned only one-half of the new york
division was included in the electrification
this was sufficient to place the new haven
road in the van as the exponent of electric
traction for trunk-line requirements

  mr mellen further says the interrup-
tions to our service are no greater nor more
frequent than when steam was in use the
business is handled with reasonable satis-
faction although it is believed that the ex-
pense is very much greater

  in other words the inference may be

drawn that the substitution of electricity has
simply resulted in maintaining the usual and
established efficiency of the service at a large-
ly increased expenditure

  in an address recently given by mr l
r pomeroy before the engineering society of
columbia university and to which the
writer is indebted for some of the statistical
matter in this article he summed the situa-
tion in a nut-shell as follows

   the only casts where electric operation
is commercially justified is in congested local
passenger situations where the conditions
closely approach a moving-sidewalk condi-
tion and the records show that these cases
have been profitable only when a large in-
crease in business has been realized

  it is only fair to the electric locomotive
after the above unfavorable facts and to the
judgment of those who risked the heavy
initial outlay for the sake of future results
to say that if the first costs could be elimina-
ted from consideration which of course they
cannot electric installation would be per-
fectly justified from the standpoint of econ-
omy as the electric locomotive can be main-
tained at about forty per cent of the cost of
the steam-engine

comparative figures

  the distribution of the amount required to
maintain a steam locomotive is approximate-
ly as follows boiler  per cent running
gear  per cent machinery  per cent
lagging and painting  per cent smoke-
box  per cent tender  per cent total
 per cent for the electric locomotive
boiler  per cent running gear  per
cent machinery  per cent one-half the
corresponding item for steam engine lag-
ging and painting  per cent  per cent
less than for steam engine smoke-box 
per cent tender  per cent total  per cent

  presuming that electricity would be adopt-
ed as the standard motive-power on the
pennsylvania railroad it is estimated that
the saving in fuel annually would be  per
cent or  water saved entirely -
 other supplies about a  per cent gain
on steam or  wages principally in
the reorganization of shop forces -
 repairs  total yearly sa-
ving through electric traction over amount at
present expended  but as large
as these alleged savings are they would not
amount to more than  to  per cent on the
necessary increase in capital which the
change would necessitate
why the steam-locomotive will stay



  that these slowly cropping facts adverse
to the electrification of existing trunk-lines
have received consideration is significantly
reflected in the thorough course of training
for apprentices which is now a feature on
the erie santa fe new york central cana-
dian pacific and many others in the various
schedules for study and practical instruction
there is not an allusion to the electric en-
gine its construction management or main-
tenance the training as outlined plainly
discloses that the end in view is to fit the
boys to cope with conditions which could
only prevail with steam-locomotives and it
would appear inconsistent to say the least
with the advanced motive-power ideas of the
present day that the expense of this elabor-
ate instruction would be incurred without
the prospect of ultimate return in the shape
of efficient service

no cause for alarm

  railroads are not exactly philanthropic
enterprises many of them supposedly pros-
perous are staggering under heavy burdens
of taxation and unjust legislation and an in-
cessant fight is in order to make both ends

meet hence the policy of their management
is keenly whetted to an appreciation of the
facts which this article has summarized and
it is to be hoped that the latter are suffi-
ciently convincing to delay even partial elec-
trification to the far distant future

  it has been shown that while terminal
electrification pays in some cases any further
steps in that direction should not occasion
any concern to the present employees of the
steam roads it would not indicate doing
away with shops roundhouses or locomo-
tives and only a very slight reduction in
the immediate terminal repair force which
would be more than compensated for by
large additions to the pay-roll of men quali-
fied in electric locomotive maintenance

  the former locomotive engineers and fire-
men of the new haven road are now em-
ployed on the motors at the same pay which
prevailed before the change and are still
entered on the roster in the old familiar
capacities a machinist or boilermaker
anywhere is as well justified to-day in en-
couraging his son to follow in his footsteps
as he would have been twenty-five years ago
because the time for the revolution if it
ever comes is far from being at hand

storm-guard for engineers

new window for protection of the man at the throttle on which dirt and

moisture cannot collect

learning from experience the dangers that
 beset the engineer of a locomotive when in a
storm he is unable to see the track ahead through
the front window of his cab a dunkirk new york
man has invented a storm-guard which he claims is
a solution of the problem

  there is no work more exacting than that of the
man at the throttle of the steam-locomotive on
his vision depends the safety of hundreds of lives

  at times it is impossible for human eyes to see
ahead on account of the weather an engineer is
seated in the engine-cab looking out through an
open space by the arrangement of the device he
is enabled to look ahead without being subjected to
a swift current of air and smoke neither can cin-
ders rain nor snow be driven into his face

  the principal part of the device consists of the
regular glass window of the cab and another pane

of glass somewhat shorter about six inches in
front of it the sides are joined together and the
bottom is open a deflector set at an angle is
placed over the opening at the top of the outer
glass the lower end protruding between the panes
of glass

  in service wind rain snow hail dirt or objects
of any kind in the air strike the deflector and are
thrown downward between the panes of glass
when the engine is traveling at a good speed not
only is there a current of air downward from the
deflector but there is a slight draft out of the cab
and down through the panes for extreme weather
conditions there is a small hinged window which
comes down and joins the inner pane closing the
opening condensation on the glass is prevented
by the current which rushes downward from the
deflector

some of the joys o dispensing pasteboards and pleasantness through
a two-by-three hole in the wall to passengers
who kick and cuss

the following paragraphs will not be used as a
means to determine why the earthworm can-
not peel potatoes with a gimlet or why the saw-
horse doesnt saw wood but simply to call the at-
tention of the traveling public to a few of the
travelers with whom we come in contact

 

  dont get it into your head that you are the only
passenger on the train

	

  if you are a traveling man commonly called a
 knight of the grip you should keep on playing
that game of    at the hotel until the train pulls
into the station it makes no difference if you have
six or eight pieces of baggage to check the ticket-
agent will have plenty of time to wait on you even
though they are stacked up at the ticket-window
seventeen deep  

  be sure and cuss the agent railroad company
and everybody on the train even though you only
go to the next stop and probably pay as much as
twenty-five cents for your ticket and twenty-five
cents excess all of which expense is paid by your
house	 

  then we have the negro preacher with his clergy
permit who has been sitting in the waiting-room
hobnobbing with the sisters until train time
when he prances up to the ticket-window planks
down his clergy book calling for a half-rate ticket
in texas while other full-grown men are paying
full fare	 

  then an old son of the soil strolls into the
waiting-room looks at the clock combs his whis-
kers with his fingers and asks if that is the correct
time proceeds to pull a dollar-and-a-half nickel-
plated duplex movement with rawhide fob attach-
ment from his overall pocket and asks to compare
with your watch to know if he has the exact time
only to find that he is expecting his wifes sister
from down brushy creek next week and lowed
as how i was mighty nigh kerrect although he
was about sixteen minutes slow according to the
regulator with a contented chuckle he turns

from the window swaps the half-pound of  star
navy from one side of his mouth to the other
and ambles out on the platform with his calloused
and sunburned hands rammed deep in his pockets
to see  them kyars come in

 

  i once remember of an instance where an  old
nester in east texas came up to the ticket-win-
dow leading a long-eared mongrel by a string and
wanted to buy a ticket for the dog to a station nine-
teen miles distant when our friend was referred
to the baggageman he reluctantly turned from the
window with a look of utter disgust muttering
something about  these new-fangled ideas

 

  the old lady with the black handbag and an
armful of bundles is still with us with the same
old stereotyped question  what time is that four
oclock train due and who says could i leave
these hyar bundles hyar in your charge while i
walks up-town and gets me a bottle of snuff and
some candy for the children to hum i clean
fergot em while i wuz up thar

 

  dont pull your wallet out at the ticket-window
take out a twenty-dollar bill to pay for a dollar-
and-forty-cent ticket and accuse the ticket-agent
of short-changing you only to find you were mis-
taken and that you had kept four or five passen-
gers from the ticket-window while you were put-
ting on your little show

	

  here he comes now the ever-jovial traveling
man  give me a ticket to hearnc all right
how much heres your money give me the
baggage-checks ill put them on for you have
a cigar  whats the use  cheer up old man we
all have our troubles

  as he sees the station porter pulling hard on the
baggage-trucks he pushes up behind turns shakes
your hand and says

   good-by old man ill see you again in thirty
days

author of  being a boomer brakeman and the evolution of almost

       bartholomew e goldsworthy takes his
       name and a few other things to arizona

chapter i

why he went to arizona

honorable charles flynn

	dispensed justice and gen-

	merchandise at winslow
ays insisted that but one of
 calamities caused men to

             seek the dry solitude of ari-
zona-poor health or family troubles

  bartholomew e goldsworthy aside from
having a six-cylinder name possessed an
anatomy of such generous dimensions as
made him look like a human tandem com-
pound

  the first time he paid his compliments to
the harvey house dining-room at the ter-
minal he calmly signed his name to the
switch list turned it in and with no appar-
ent distress found trackage for all the loads
the lady working the field set out

  this was circumstantial evidence that so
far as general appetite and health went he
had no need for either a bad order-card or
a dry climate

  if the honorable charles really knew
what he was talking about bartholomew e
goldsworthy came to arizona on account of
domestic infelicities

  bartholomew looked as much too big for
the position of roadmaster as he did for the
suit of overalls he purchased the day he
broke in on the time-table life of the ter-
minal

  it may have been his size which brought
him the job for the superintendent had just
terminated an experience with a man who
was too small for the place and as the hon-
orable charles had often remarked  better
have the plug too big for the hole than the
hole too big for the plug

  at any rate bartholomew dropped from
no  one morning and when no  went
through that night he was roadmaster for
the third division where one hundred and
forty-three miles of track spends all the time
it is not going up a mountain going down
one or around another in his new position
bartholomew was in duty bound to see that
about three hundred mexicans and indians
received nothing from the company under
false pretenses

  according to the eminent member of the
territorial judiciary already mentioned it is
no small task to teach an indian which end
of the spike goes into the tie and to thorough-
ly convince him that he is wasting time en-
deavoring to drive the big nail through the
base of the rail or an angle-bar

  speaking with some authority no doubt
the jurist further deposes that in mexico a
head is made on both ends of the match for
the reason that the native would otherwise
strike the wrong end for an hour before
realizing that in order to get results he must
turn it around

  it is self-evident that there were condi-
tions surrounding the position of roadmaster
on the third division which made it less
desirable than some other places in the offi-
cial list and that bartholomew accepted such
a job in such a country would indicate that
his domestic infelicities may have been of
an extraordinarily turbulent nature

  while the division pay-roll insisted on
maintaining the dignity of the roadmasters
office by carrying his full name in less than
a month after his appointment bartholomew
e goldsworthy underwent an operation

  a large portion of the alphabet was ampu-
tated from his personal label

  however as bart goldie appeared to be
just as large a man just as active and just


the railroad majts magazine

as regular in his eating as had bartholomew
e goldsworthy it is reasonable to suppose
that the operation was not only quite suc-
cessful but painless

  when i met bart goldie the first time i
was sure that i wasnt going to like him and
just as sure that i would be particular not
to let him know it

  it was the second summer the cinder pit
was in operation one thinks of a cinder pit
as a hole in the ground but unless one is able
to imagine a very deep hole turned inside
out and upside down the cinder pit was
so far from being a hole in the ground that
it was a mountain of aolcanic ashes

  instead of digging down for the cinders
a few charges of dynamite judiciously placed
along the big cliff would bring down more
cinders than three crews could haul away in
a day

  over one hundred laborers were used in
the work at the cinder pit and another
hundred took care of the unloading and bal-
lasting at various locations along the right-
of-way

  bart goldie came onto the job as road-
master just after the pit had opened that
summer after he found out what he was
against he made his headquarters at the pit
making little side trips over the division
keeping in close touch with the progress of
the work

  coming east one afternoon a few days
after the pit had opened i got an order at
ash fork to set out my string pick up all
the empty cinder flats in the yard run to
the cinder pit and tie up

  of course i said a few uncomplimentary
things about certain individuals connected
with the road which found a unanimous in-
dorsement from the entire crew

  after showing our independence by taking
thirty minutes more time than usual in which
to eat and putting it down on the delay re-
port in a bold bad hand we went out to
shuffle the cars and make up our train

  it was turning dusk when we pulled in on
the siding at the pit and tied up for the
night it was evident that we had drawn our
summer vacation we were to be one of the
three crews in the hauling service for some
time at least and i guess even one on the
crew felt rather bellicose

  i had reached the popping-off stage my-
self and just as soon as the doghouse was
in the clear i started out to find the jefe
as the mexicans call the big boss and unload
some of my pent-up ire in his vicinity as a
result i met bart goldie

  i found bart engaged in a rather extraor-
dinary pastime down at the end of the spur
where a dozen outfit cars served as temporary
quarters for the foreign population

  it seems that goldies education while it
was really college-made was mighty weak on
foreign languages especially spanish quite
naturally he had been forced to make up the
linguistic deficiency by a generous use of his
hands so generous in fact that his fist
when neatly folded and placed in a position
near ones nose looked like a gould knuckle

  it had come in contact with romero gar-
cias left lamp when romero had suffi-
ciently returned to consciousness as to be
positive that he had not been caught beneath
a cave-in from the cinder cliff he did not
take kindly to the roadmasters method of
argument and planned to take summary re-
venge

  romero unlike the average care-free mexi-
can was of fair size and of sullen and de-
fiant disposition he ruled his outfit through
brute force and had been a source of trouble
long before bart goldie came on the job for
he stirred up dissension on the least provo-
cation

  it seems that goldie had insisted that
the gang was not loading the flats with a rea-
sonable degree of speed when he found
romero sitting in the shade smoking a cig-
arette he motioned him back to work

  romero became sullen and his sullenness
spread with strange contagion to the rest of
the gang and during the course of the after-
noon romero acting as ring-leader and
spokesman informed the new jefe on cer-
tain little matters and endeavored to run in
his bluff goldie had in his rebuttal intro-
duced a knockout argument in the form of
his right fist

  this was several hours before the 
pulled in on the siding with the cinder flats
and quite naturally when i walked around
the outfit cars and found a six-footer doing
a juggling act with a track gage and a mexi-
can i wasnt sure whether i had suddenly
dropped in on a nicaraguan revolution or a
vaudeville performance

  goldie thoroughly convinced several of
that gang that a gage-iron can be used for
other things besides measuring the distance
between rails and that night they took ro-
mero and two of his mutineers down to the
terminal for treatment

  with three of the gang bowled over the
rest of them happened to remember that the
tortillas and frijoles were ready wifey
would be awful angry if she had to wait
on short time



supper on them and a prairie dog didnt
have them beat very much when it came to
getting into the clear in a hurry

  when the show was over goldie turned
about and saw me standing near of course
the light wasnt extra good and i had
thoughtlessly picked up a side-stake as i
came up

  what do you want im running this
job  it was evident that goldie was still
foaming a little i promptly dropped the
side-stake and hastened to assure him that
from all appearances he was running the
job and that i had no desire to make ap-
plication for his place

  when he realized that i was just a harm-
less conductor and if not thoroughly civi-
lized at least partially domesticated he be-
gan to laugh

   guess im getting nervous he remarked
 every time i hear a fellow coming up be-
hind me i think he wants to play mumble-
peg on my back with a butcher knife talk
about your football games bucking center
is parlor pastime alongside this job that
gang will work the way i want or ill put
them all in the hospital 

  it was the way he said that last sentence
which prejudiced me against goldie there
was something of the bully in his manner
that evening over at the mess-room when
we were planning the work for the following
day he remarked

  to-morrow morning we will leave here
with forty loads and-

  we have never hauled more than thirty-
five with one of these hogs i interrupted

  well take forty loads he continued
just as if he had not heard me we can
get away from here by six oclock get down
to the curve below riordan and have the
cinders unloaded before the passenger-train
runs us in

  of course after having been accustomed
to leaving the pit at seven oclock-as we did
the first season it was operated-that one
hour made me very enthusiastic we had
never tried to unload even thirty flats on the
riordan curves ahead of the morning pas-
senger and i made a mental note that mr
goldsworthy our new roadmaster had some
few things to learn in operating cinder trains

  but the next morning when he came down
and almost kicked in the caboose-door i
realized that we were going to leave at six
oclock with forty loads just as he said
thats just what we did and we unloaded
the string and were well in the clear when
the passenger came along

  after i had been working with him for a
week i learned that when goldie said we
are going to do so-and-so you could take it
as a part of the standard book of rules
while he evidently knew more about college
football than he did of train tonnage and
cinder plows he had decided views about
ballasting track and improving a right-of-
way

  we had been working about ten days and
it began to look as if the train-master had
lost us all together i began to feel a long-
ing for an emery-wheel and a real bath with
a sandpaper rub-down we had been eat-
ing canned corn and corn in the can three
times a day until every time one of us tried
to yell it sounded like the tin solo at a
charivari

  then the  got the idea that she was
a street sprinkler and went to leaking like
a sieve so for the good of the order i wired
the train-master to run us in to winslow for
general repairs

  nothing hurts a train-master more than
light mileage the old man rather than let
us run from the pit to the terminal with an
engine and a caboose sent a message order-
ing us to run extra and do whatever work
goldie might find for us on the way in

  there was a slow order out on bridge 
over cosnino creek and it seems that a
cloudburst up in the mountains had sent a
torrent of water down that way doing quite
a little damage to the embankments

  we will take five cars of cinders re-
marked goldie  pick up the section gang
at cosnino and see what we can do at the
bridge

  of course puttering around there for sev-
eral hours with an appetite which would
have made business mighty good at the har-
vey house gnawing at my vitals particular-
ly appealed to me but we did it just be-
cause goldie said we would

  when we got down to the bridge we found
the water hurling down a ravine which
paralleled the track for a half mile where
it emptied into cosnino creek at the bridge
it had taken away enough of the bank to let
two telegraph poles down and the wires
were swishing about in the current

  i sent back a flag and goldie began to
exercise his sign language for the benefit of
our foreign passengers with the result that
they were shortly working a bit faster than
they had ever worked before

  while i acted as a sort of straw boss over
the unloading goldie took four of the mexi-
cans down to see if he could get the tele-


the railroad mans magazine

graph wires out of the water while the
water in the ravine was not more than waist
deep it was tunning swift and cosnino
creek was really a torrent

  after hauling and tugging for some time
goldie managed to get the wires free from
the poles with a view of fastening them on
the superstructure of the bridge until the
linemen could come out and restring them

  the mexicans being by nature very hos-
tile to a bath didnt take kindly to going
into the water but finally three of them were
either persuaded or frightened into wading
out to attach a rope to the wires so that they
could be pulled over to the bridge

  i guess the natives didnt understand the
nature of a telegraph wire for when they got
out to them instead of putting the rope about
them it looked much easier to just take hold
and pull them in

  they drew the grand surprise the minute
their hands closed about the wires there was
a bunch of yells that would have made an
apache war-cry sound as gentle as a bene-
diction two of those mexicans came out
of the water scrambled up the bank and
started down the track im a goat if you
could have caught either one of them with a
prairie type on a down-grade most of the
time they were running wheel to wheel for
when one would get ahead the other would
reach for him and pull him back and if
you ever see two mexicans just touching the
high spots headed toward the line dont try
to stop them for they are some scared

  the third one furnished the real excite-
ment and incidentally obliterated my prej-
udice against bart goldie he let out one
agonizing screech and went under he came
up in a second and started to produce an-
other vocal noise but the best he could do
was to give us a very realistic imitation of a
whale spouting then he went off his feet
and the swift current shot him out into
cosnino creek

  i knew it was all over except burning the
candles-but i hadnt figured on goldie

  by the time i was off the cinder flat
goldie had reached the steep bank i knew
that cosnino creek below the bfidge was lit-
tle less than a canon and that it would be
impossible to get out of it without the aid
of a rope

  i wanted to explain this to him but by
the time i had covered half the distance to
where he stood he had thrown off his hat
taken a festive skip and a hop and just
as if he was taking his first plunge in the old
swimming hole he went in head first

  the bank was thirty feet high and almor-t
as smooth as a building wall and i was
positive that the job of roadmaster would
be open to competition again within thirty
minutes

  nobody ever accused me of having a brain-
throb or an idea so i guess it must have been
 dude  bowling my brakeman  the
cipder end who went to the caboose after the
rope

  i know i was hypnotized by the sight
in the water so that all i could do was fol-
low along the bank and make mind bets
that theyll both stay down this time

  i guess i lost a million dollars before i
realized that goldie had found a piece of
rock sticking out of the bank and was hold-
ing to it with one hand and keeping the
mexicans head out of water with the other
then bowling came up with the rope and
the rest was easy

  goldie held to -the rock while bowling
and i pulled the mexican out and then we
dropped the rope over for the roadmaster
in a few minutes he too was standing on
the top of the bank the mexican wasnt
standing understand he was more or less
water-soaked and wasnt a bit enthusiastic
about coming back to life but goldie
wrestled him around for ten minutes and he
finally began to mutter something about  the
much grand jefe which would have em-
barrassed goldie if lie had fully under-
stood it

  from that day on goldie was elevated to
a station of reverence with every mexican
on the division and some of the american
population that i know decided they thought
a great deal more of him than they would
care to admit in public

  we wont say anything about this when
we get into winslow remarked goldie as
we climbed on the caboose and since goldie
said we wouldnt we made a noise like a
long silence but it finally got out through
the mexicans

  on the way in that evening i found that
goldie had made no permanent arrangement
for his roundhouse accommodations and i
suggested that he join me in my two-room
adobe over in old town

  it was only a few hundred yards from the
tracks and there was a cook-stove and a few
pieces of chinaware not to mention the furni-
ture so that a fellow could live very com-
fortable at a small cost

  the idea appealed to the new roadmaster
and he went over with me to try it out the
result was that he camped right there and
on short time



in less than a month i was convinced that
the honorable charles flynn was correct

  family troubles brought goldie to arizona

  about the second time we took our chairs
outside and leaned back against the adobe
wall when all the fireworks were hung out
in the sky and the cool breeze from the san
francisco mountains drifted down to twist
the smoke from our pipes into funny shapes-
about the second time we sat out there and
heard the laughter drifting over from a mexi-
can dance which was going on farther down
the crooked street and the dreamy guitars and
mandolins in the strains of  la paloma -
he came clean with it

  bartholomew e goldsworthy had been
playing the role of the sheep with the bru-
nette wool he had been educated for a
civil engineer and had turned out a cham-
pion football player

  by putting two and two together i man-
aged to figure out that he really knew the
difference between a  t  square and a sur-
veyors chain and that his family troubles
were not so much with his own family as
with a young lady of another family who had
expressed an aversion for black sheep

  ive always been so busy trying to keep
my name on the pay-roll and my caboose in
the clear that i have had no time to give
the woman question much consideration but
the honorable charles says that if it wasnt
for his wife he would never have owned the
only general merchandise emporium in win-
slow and he would never have been elected
to the dignified position of justice of the
peace

  so i suppose there are really some women
who could put enough steam in an old scrap-
pile like me to make him get out and make
the running time with his full tonnage

  as for bart he seemed to be on short time
there were certain circumstances which he
discussed very guardedly which convinced
me that he wanted to do something worth
while and he wanted to do it quick it
looked as if it might be a case of two fel-
lows running for the same station one of
them coming down grade and the other going
up

  bart had the up-grade to climb and a poor
start and knowing a few elemental truths
about human machinery i couldnt see how
he was going to win when he was out there
by himself with nothing much to think about
but the way lie had slammed the gate in the
face of opportunity

  since they have put a double track around
the world the old ball seems to have shrunk

considerable no matter where you go youre
pretty close to some place else and it sur-
prises a fellow when he jumps a board bill
in el paso and meets the landlady in chi-
cago a year later or when he bids a friend
a fond farewell in mexico city only to
meet him in new york

  its a very small world after all and im
not surprised to know that bart goldie
should come to arizona for the express pur-
pose of hiding himself from a certain young
lady until he had made a man of himself
only to put on his working-clothes and meet
her here face to face when he hadnt had
a shave for a week

  one night over at the cinder pit bart
came into my caboose and picked up an old
official list which gives the names of every
one connected with the management of the
road down to the division superintendents
hired girl

  he looked it over rather careless-like and
started to throw it back on my desk when
a name near the top arrested his attention

    a r martin general manager west-
ern lines lie read then he just let the
book slip from his fingers after a minute
he said isnt that funny

  funny i replied funny i should
say it is ive laughed myself sick over it
many times

  i guessed my sarcasm lacked steam for
bart never noticed it

   id like to see a r martin he contin-
ued  but of course he cant be the same
man 

   if you want to see him i volunteered
you will probably have plenty of oppor-
tunity this summer i understand he is com-
ing through here next week his family
generally puts in several weeks at the grand
canon

  if bart said another word that night it
was after i had gone to the hay and when
i once get into the hay-well ive been
known to sleep several hours after dawn
when i knew my pay-check was waiting for
me over at the agents office

chapter ii

the lady at he wreck

t f you ever attended the b of r t an-
a nual ball at winslow you know just as
well as i do that it was attended by every
railroad man who was fortunate enough to
be in town-wearing his best pair of over-
alls


the railroad mans magazine

  the winslow symphony orchestra prac-
tised from one year to the next just for that
ball and then there were times when it
would run out of pieces and have to go back
to the first number and that was a real
orchestra too

  there was  dad  matta the human cube
four feet any way you measured him who
played the violin what time he wasnt selling
chili and beans over in old town  dutch 
mattison who could blow more music out of
a flute than i could churn out of a hand-
organ ken gillett who could triple-
tongue a cornet until you was sure he would
stutter when he tried to talk and the little
lady with the brown lamps who could ramble
over that piano until you stood about as
much chance of counting her fingers as you
would the pickets on a fence from the win-
dow of the limited when she was four hours
late and running down-hill

  sometimes the ball was held in december
and sometimes in july one year it run in
sections the first going by in the winter and
the second section coming along in the sum-
mer but as it was warm in winslow all the
time the season of the year never cut much
of a figure except on the price of eggs which
were high in the summer and higher in the
winter i suppose the hens were more to
blame than the heat

  the year that bart goldie came to the
third division the annual ball wtas held in
the middle of july-not that bart was
there but that my crew just happened to be
in town thanks to the disposition of the
 to choke up in the nozzle

  i planned to be there in time to see mayor
bauerbach who owned the only dress suit
in town lead the grand march and i prom-
ised myself that when the janitor locked the
hall the next morning he would have to put
me out

  i put in all afternoon creasing my black
trousers and trimming some of the fringe off
my best coat and i fixed up my shoes so
that they looked as if theyd just been turned
out of the paint-shop

  when the six oclock whistle sounded over
at the roundhouse i decided that i would
put on my good clothes treat myself to sup-
per in die harvey house dining-room and
get used to myself being in company

  more than once i wished that bart could
have been there for a college education dont
have much of a chance to show off when its
associating with mexicans and indians all
the time

  over on the siding near the offices pri-

vate cars nos  and  the latter the trav-
eling office for the division superintendent
were lined up together i walked down to the
despatchers office to take a look at the board
and i had to laugh when i saw bennett
marked up for extra west at  pm

  if there is one thing that bennett would
rather do than draw his pay-check it is to
dance it took no vivid imagination to pic-
ture bennett when the call-bov caught him
just as i was leaving the office with my
glad flags out he came in to get his orders
and register out

    going to the ball   i asked

   no he snapped

  oh thats right i continued you
dont care much for dancing

  he turned around and gave me a look
that would have stopped a wild engine and
not only requested but demanded that i take
a long journey to a warm climate

  instead i went as far as the dining-room
walked right in as if i had time-card rights
and took a chair at one of the seventy-five-cent
tables

  i had hardly decided which dishes i
would have switched out for me when in
walked the old man and a r martin the
general manager and come to think of it
there were two ladies-but i saw only one
for the time being

  during supper-i suppose bart would
have called it dinner-i kept my eyes on
that young lady she was a little the best
i ever saw-a real observation pullman with
all the latest improvements

  she looked like a million dollars worth
of one-dollar bills and as i finished the last
of three different kinds of dessert i just
says to myself young lady if you ever
want a partner in a home-sweet-home
waltz id sure like to have the job

  in fact i hadnt got her off my mind
when the music started for the grand march
i was standing there looking around to see
if there was any young lady in the hall who
even remotely resembled her when some one
touched me on the arm and i turned about
to meet the freckled oblong wall-eyed face
of the call-boy grinning at me as he stuck
that dirty book before me

    extra west in ten minutes he said like
a parrot that didnt know anything else

  the mayor was just coming onto the floor
his lady on his arm and his white shirt in
that low-necked vest showing up like a new
coat of paint on a signal-block

   hurry up an sign cause ive got to
find yer shacks yet -
on short time



   i never wanted to see how- hard i could
 kick some one as bad as i did right then
 i believe i could have put that call-boy on
 the peak of bill williams mountain from a
 standing start

   well sign it baldy sign it its the
 wrecker and ive got to get th rest of yer
 crew

   with music in my ears i put my official
 signature on the book and started for the
 despatchers office feeling as festive as if i
 were riding a pilot-beam into a head-on col-
 lision

   when i reached the office i found the
 wrecking outfit standing on the main line
 andthe switch engine was coupling into the
 two private cars preparatory to bringing
 them out and setting them on behind my
 caboose i hastened into the office and asked
 the cause

    bennetts in the ditch beyond moqui 

   if i had that mans disposition i would
 stay away from a- railroad just because
 he couldnt stay in for the ball he goes out
 and the first little bridge he comes to he
 puts two engines and eleven cars through
 it just so some other fellow will have to
 leave the festivities and go out and pick
 him up

   any body hurt i asked

   not a soul answered the chief

   that showed plain enough that it was a
 put-up job

   how soon will you be ready i asked

    just as soon as you sign these orders

   what engine do i get

   take one of the yard engines the
 

   there i was with my best trousers on and
 a new shine on my shoes there wasnt
 anything to do but sign the orders and get
 out of town

   when i took the orders out to the engineer
 i looked to see just what i had in the way of
 a train the wrecker and the coal-tender
 three cars of ties a water-car tool-car my
 caboose and private cars  and  the old
 man and the general manager were going
 out with me and then i heard a voice which
 sounded a great deal like- that of the young
 lady i had seen in the dining-room

    but father she was saying  i never
 saw a real wreck in my life and im going
 along

   its no place for a woman lois youll
 just be fatigued

   the idea of a man being the general man-
 ager of a railroad and saying that a wreck
  is no place for a woman especially a beau-
  rr

tiful woman but of course i couldnt stop
and tell him that he was wrong so i just yell
 aboard  and gave denny reagan the
high-ball as the young lady was on the
car platform when we started the question
solved itself and she went along

  the  had seen better days but denny
reagan got more out of her that night than
i ever dreamed she had of course she
made a few little side trips out into the
surrounding country but she always came
back to the rails and kept running and just
so long as the whistle worked denny could
make any engine run

  we dropped down through the moqui sag
the old boat shooting a stream of sparks from
the stack that would have made the tail on
a comet look like a glow-worm and while we
hardly made the limiteds time up moqui
hill we were going at a pretty fair clip when
we topped the ridge

  bang bang went the torpedoes and the
tail lights from bennetts caboose showed
up less than a mile down the track

  the wreck wasnt so bad as it might have
been for both engines of the double-header
had crossed the little bridge and while they
were on the ties they were still right side up

  the piling under the short trestle had
burned away the eleven cars next the en-
gines were scattered about in various degrees
of dilapidation some of them were ready
for the tooth-pick box while others would
have made better kindling-wood

  the section hands from moqui beat us
there but the mexicans were so busy cache-
ing out bottles of beer and shoes that they
had done absolutely nothing else

  of course the first thing was to get the
steam derrick down to the wreckage and
swing it off the right-of-way we coupled
onto bennetts caboose cut off the string that
was still on the rails and pulled them back
to the siding at moqui switched the wrecker
ahead and went back to put in the balance
of the night opening up the track

  when we got back to the wreck another
derrick and wrecking gang had arrived from
the cinder pit and with it was bart goldie

  from the minute he stepped off that
wrecking train things began to move the
old man and he had a very brief conference
while the general manager stood by and lis-
tened

   its up to you to say just what you want
to do mr arnold i heard bart say to the
old man  if you want to stand for the
delay i can build a shoo-fly around this in
twelve hours


the railroad mans magazine

   but what do you think best   ques-
tioned the superintendent

   if you were not here and i had to act
on my own responsibility i would open the
main line in the shortest time possible re-
plied the roadmaster

   which means-

   which means that i would roll some of
these badly demolished cars down the bank

  then the general manager spoke in a mod-
est voice as if he was apologizing for being
on earth

   dont you think mr arnold that it is
always a pretty good rule to clear the main
line as soon as possible especially when we
have mail-trains coming down on us and the
government checking up every trip we
make  

   its expensive volunteered arnold

  i suppose barts idea of railroading had
not prepared him to see officials stand back
and study over a move as if they were play-
ing a game of checkers at any rate the
two officials were still discussing the ques-
tion when bart started his men to work by
the time they had decided to clear the track
at any cost he had already rolled two box
cars down the bank

  the old man found himself taking orders
from bart just the same as the rest of us
the new roadmaster standing in the very
center of the debris on a box car which had
been stood on end was directing the two
derricks and a half dozen various squads of
laborers at the same time if he made a
false move it would take more of an expert
thani to tell just where it was

  off to one side of the track one gang had
started to burn some of the wreckage the
big fire flared up making a ragged silhouette
of the entire mass barts six feet of nerve
and muscle seemed to stick out as the big
feature of the picture

  i was recalled to the fact that there was
a lady in the wrecking party martin was
standing off to one side watching the work
apparently well satisfied with the progress
being made i had just come down off the
apex of the pile of wreckage following a
consultation with bart and as i passed by
martin i heard that musical voice again

   who is that man standing up there
father  

  thats the roadmaster

  but what is his name insisted the
young woman whom i now distinguished in
the shadow by the general managers side

   goldsworthy i believe replied her
father

  isnt that funny after a little pause
she continued more for her own information
than for the enlightenment of her father
 but he cant be the same man

  about that time i was beginning to be-
lieve that it really was funny for bart had
said something like that the night he was
looking over the official list and found
martins name at the head of it

  well daughter i dont know exactly
what you are talking about but i hardly
think he is any one you ever saw before
as i walked away i had to think of the
time i was standing on a street corner down
in el paso and a fellow kept looking at me
until i began to wonder if i had ever board-
ed with him finally i spoke up

  was there something that you wanted
sir 

   i was just thinking he replied  that
you look as if you might be able to change
a five-dollar bill for me which simply goes
to prove that when a fellow thinks on sur-
face facts he is always just about four dol-
lars and ninety-five cents wrong and i was
just about ready to bet my monthly insult
against a blind gasket that after all he was
the same man

  for the next half-hour i watched miss
martin more than i did the wrecker and
she watched bart goldie more than she did
anybody or anything else

  if bart had known that the general man-
ager and his daughter were standing less
than a hundred feet from him much inter-
ested in his work he could have done noth-
ing more to appear to the best advantage

  of course i dont know what the girl
thought about him for no one can tell what
a woman thinks except the woman herself
and about half the time shes wrong but
when martin insisted on taking his daughter
back to the private car just as they were
passing by me i heard him remark

  that man goldsworthy is a wonderful
worker wonderful i shouldnt be sur-
prised but that he gets this litter cleaned up
by daylight

    i should like to get a good look at him
said the girl close up so i could see his
face

  youll probably have the opportunity in
the morning for- they passed out of my
hearing and i was half convinced that mar-
tin was after all a man of excellent judg-
ment not only of daughters but of desirable
roadmasters

  the sun was just coming up over the mesa
beyond moqui when bart gave me the order
on short time



to take the wrecker back to moqui and bring
back a couple of loads of ties

  the track had been cleared and all there
was left to do was to replace about two hun-
dred ties and put in a couple of rails with
the trestle cribbed the main line would be in
temporary repair

  i suppose reagan being used to kicking
cars around in the yard handled our train a
little rough for private cars for when we got
the ties ahead at moqui the old man came
out of his car and i could tell by the red
spots on his face and the way he hadnt
combed his hair that he wasnt in an angelic
mood

  i couldnt help but wonder how he would
have felt if he had been up all night wear-
ing a pair of shoes that were two sizes too
small for him getting mud and oil on a pair
of black trousers which besides having cost
 two years ago had been hand-pressed
the day before and on top of that knowing
that the mayor was a strutting around the
ballroom down at winslow with a sparkler
in his boiled shirt as big as an electric head-
light

  i couldnt help speculating on what he
might have done under those circumstances
if a dish-faced piker like bennett had kept
asking him every time he got within tele-
graph distance if he could have the pleasure
of his company for the next dance i really
would have enjoyed being superintendent
that night i would have tied a piece of
hardware onto bennett the size of a bald-
win boiler

  when we started back to the wreck the
old man climbed on with us going down to
see how much fault he could find bart had
the gang cribbing the trestle when we got
there i admit that the crib looked as if it
had been built contrary to all the laws of
statics it was a fine imitation of a rheu-
matic pig-pen

  that will never hold a train growled
the superintendent when he reached bart

   we will see replied the roadmaster
knowing bart i held my breath for a min-
ute to see if the superintendent would argue
the question he never said another word
on the subject-not there at least-but went
nosing about looking into every nook and
corner as if he had lost his carfare

  goodness only knows what he thought of
the job but so far as i am concerned while
it may have been lacking a little finish in
spots it had been clone in less time than i
had ever dreamed possible two hours later
when no  whistled for the board at moqui

the operator gave her the white wing and she
drifted down to the scene of the wreck

  bart and the superintendent were still
down there i suppose the old man was
just waiting to see how far into the ravine
one of the pullmans would go when it hit
that crib which had been built like a pyra-
mid stand on its head we had tried it out
with the wreck trains and it had hardly
sagged an inch at the distance of half a
mile i couldnt tell just how she acted under
the varnished cars but i could tell even from
that distance that the passenger-train had not
stopped and when angel the next station
beyond  osed  no  she was on time

  i was still standing in the center of the
track watching number  as she crept across
the damaged trestle when the general man-
ager walked up to me

  number  is on time isnt she he
asked

   be here right on the dot i replied glad
of an opportunity to be of any little service
to the father of that daughter-more so since
he was working on the same road

  then the wreck has caused no delay to
our passenger service

  not a bit i answered

   isnt that rather rapid time in cleaning
up a mess like that

  well mr martin i replied ive
helped clean up a good many of them and
this is the best job in the shortest time i
ever heard of

  i just made a mental note that bart goldie
owed me four bits for that boost

   are you going back to the wreck soon  
asked the general manager

   ill run down to pick up mr arnold and
mr goldsworthy before going into winslow
im waiting for running orders from the
despatchers office now dont expect to start
back until number  goes in as goldsworthy
wants to see her across the crib before he
leaves

   when you get down there please tell mr
goldsworthy that mr martin wants to see
him in car no  when it is convenient for
him if he has nothing to hinder tell him
to come over and ride to winslow with me

  yes sir ill tell him i answered

  and ill be much obliged to you sir
replied the general manager i really felt
for the first time that he was a decent sort
of a fellow-almost as near human as a
brakeman or a conductor

  number  crossed the crib and came by
on time when she was over the switch
we ran around the string with the 


the railroad mans magazine

brought the two private cars out on the main
line went in for the rest of our short train
and pulled out and coupled the varnished
carlets on behind

  i went over and insisted that reagan
handle them with plush gloves and he really
did a nice ladylike job of it after having
backed down to the site of the wreck we
had to wait another half-hour for bart

  while we were waiting i went over to
where he was and delivered the message from
the general manager bart accepted it with
the joy of a prisoner taking a twenty-year
sentence he looked down at his khaki
clothes-that is they were once khaki they
were now benzine sand molasses grease
and in one spot nothing at all during the
night he had grown careless with one of
the fires and had lost about four inches off
the bottom of his left pants-leg

  after i had delivered the message he
pulled a wad of waste from his hip pocket
wiped it across his brow not knowing that it
left a smear of oil rubbed his left thumb
which had been badly mutilated by a falling
jack and muttered

  and i have not had a shave for days
never mind bart i cut in feeling
rather peevish at the way he stood on a
little formality of that kind  come over
to the caboose and ill have the rear shack
give you a shave and a hair-cut manicure
your finger nails and-

  bart slowly looked me over he noticed
the fading crease in my trousers the rem-
nant of a shine on my shoes and the stiff
hat i was wearing-and-he smiled

  no he says  if bowling turns out such
dude conductors as you i guess id better
stay away

  never mind i answered  i haint been

livin beyond my income i can afford all
these good clothes bart youre a friend of
mine and i know youll be pleased with
my good luck i made a fortune last night
gambling asked bart

   yes gambling i won so fast i couldnt
keep count you remember that night up
at the pit when you found something so
funny in the official list you read a r
martins name then you looked wise and
remarked that it couldnt be the same man
i didnt think much of the remark that
night but having nothingvmuch to occupy
my mind i went to gambling on it lets
see at midnight i had won  i bet
myself that he was the same man

    and how do you know you won   asked
bart with an imitation smile

   by the way you kept away from him
and by what his daughter said

    his daughter 

   if bart had not been impressed with the
train-load of money i had won he was real
excited over a portion of my proofs

   yes i replied his daughter she ij
back there in the private car

   baldy have you a razor in your ca-
boose  

  nothing but a broken looking-glass
bart

   well tell mr martin ill be over in a
few minutes

   as bart climbed onto the caboose to wash
some of the soil from his anatomy and dig
the cinders from his hair i gave reagan the

transcontinental railroad building seems to belong to such a dim
remote past that it gives one a creepy feeling at first to talk with the men
who actually carried on the work of one of its most spectacular achieve-
ments but after meeting a number of them and finding them still enjoying
life and as young as ever one begins to feel that the c p r isnt so ancient
after all

     pushing a road-bed through the wilderness of southern canada  to the
western limits of british columbia was a heavy undertaking and now and then
there was excitement enough for every one and plenty of trouble always in store
for those in search of it

experiences of the rough and ready crew who helped to build canadas
greatest railroad many of whom are still holding
down their old jobs

  liminary surveys through that part of the
  wilderness between cartier and kenora-a
  little stretch of  miles-and who was en-
  gineer of construction on the  miles be-
  tween markstay and missanabie

    he acquired the railroad-building habit
  in such aggravated form that after the road
  was completed he went to brazil where he
  pursued his vocation until surveys were be-
  gun for the grand trunk pacific he then
  returned to get cooled off once more on the
  latest of the transcontinental lines in the far
  north william brandreth now a member
  of the provincial parliament in british co-
  lumbia and a prosperous farmer near van-
  couver was another old-timer discovered ri-
  ding  a limited train across the wilderness
  which he helped survey for the c p r be-
  ginning away back in 

on the right-of-way

speaking of this newest of transcontinental
lines it isnt like the good old days any
more when they were trying to find out
where to lay the rails of the canadian pa-


f course j m egan who was
superintendent on the canadian
pacific railway during con-
struction from ss to 
didnt mean to tie up the road
when he sent out a message a
couple of years ago announcing that he was
making a trip over the line and would be
glad to meet all the old-timers once more
he simply didnt realize that on the c p
r as everybody in the dominion calls it
no one ever dies and still fewer resign

  the history-makers of the canadian pa-
cific are still walking around hale and
hearty and so numerous are they that egan
thought his car was being mobbed when he
pulled into medicine hat he was delight-
ed to find that it was only the old gang
which had taken his message to all liter-
ally no other railroad on earth can boast
such a complete living history as the c p r

  i	had hardly got settled comfortably on
one of the through trains which cover the
longest run on the continent from montreal
to vancouver  miles before i was in-
troduced to s r toole who made the pre-


the railroad mans magazine

cific men were willing to go out into the wil-
derness for twenty dollars a month and live
on a diet of  chicago chicken which is a
euphemism for pickled pork when they
could get it but as provisions had to be
brought up in canoes and on mens backs
the surveying parties were forced to live a
good part of the time on the anticipations
of what they would do to a beefsteak the
next time they caught one alone and unpro-
tected

  on the grand trunk pacific the men got
from forty to fifty dollars a month and three
meals a day with oatmeal and condensed
milk bacon and beans desiccated potatoes
pickles jam cheese lime-juice corned beef
canned vegetables fruit and butter

  think of it butter in the woods yet
the men kicked because they couldnt have
printed menus and clean napkins at every
meal

  the way the men in a surveying-party are
pampered nowadays is scandalous they
are furnished with mosquito-proof tents in
the summer and tents with stoves in the
winter the chef has a cook-tent and a port-
able range in the good old days only the
staff reveled in the luxury of a stove while
the men slept in a wigwam as for the cook
they didnt have chefs then he fried the
bacon and made the coffee over an open fire
when the rain didnt put it out

  they can take luxuries into the wilder-
ness but they cannot do away with its perils
twenty-five men were drowned on the grand
trunk pacific surveys winter too has its
terrors an axman sent on an errand failed
to return after a two-days search they
found him standing up against a tree his
legs frozen stiff and immovable

  he had fallen into a waterhole getting
wet to the waist and had gotten his matches
damp so that he could not- build a fire to
dr himself out another man froze his legs
to the knee and finding no surgeon handy
amputated his own toes with a razor and a
pair of scissors from which it would ap-
pear that cold-blooded nerve was not an at-
tribute monopolized by the old-timers

the mounted police

  billy mcleod now manager of a de-
tective agency at vancouver helped make
history as high private in the rear rank of
the detachment of royal northwest mounted
police assigned to duty on the railroad he
began when the end of the track was at flat
creek  miles west of winnipeg it is

pretty well known that the canadian pacific
was built without any of the disgraceful law-
lessness that marked the construction of
transcontinental railroads on this side of the
border but it may not be so well known
that the mounted police were chiefly respon-
sible for this immunity from trouble

  the mounted police were sent to keep
things straight on the road and they did it
by adhering strictly to the one great funda-
mental rule on which the force is founded
which is to do things first and consider the
fine points of the action afterward when
there is nothing else on hand if a man
hasnt sense enough to know what the right
thing to do under any and all circumstances
is he cant get on the force

war on fire-water

  bad men and men who would have been
bad if they had had the courage flocked to
the canadian pacific just as they did to the
american roads the only difference being
that they didnt stay on the canadian road
the mounted police were always on hand
whenever strangers arrived in camp and if
said strangers could not give a satisfactory
reason for their presence there they received
such a pressing invitation to leave that they
never refused

  the most persistent and determined efforts
were made to supply the construction-gangs
with whisky the laws of manitoba did not
prohibit the sale of liquor but when the
canadian pacific railway company was
confronted with the alternative of burdening
itself with a drunken construction-force or
preventing the men from having all the li-
quor they wanted it elected to let them
go thirsty the word was passed to the
mounted police to prevent the sale of liquor
without too fine splitting of hairs over the
law in the case

  and they certainly did it they boarded
all trains they searched all wagons and
when they found whisky they poured it out
on the thirsty prairie soil thousands of
gallons of whisky went to stimulate the
growth of sunflowers along the railroad so
great was the drought that whisky was
quoted at fifty dollars a gallon with none to
be had at any price

  it was not because the whisky-dealers were
not ingenious in expedients for they tried to
smuggle in small kegs of the stuff in cases
of dry-goods and pianos in egg-shells in
ox-yokes and even in bibles but whisky
could not be hidden from the redcoats
pioneers of the canadian pacific



  bootleggers who tempted by the hope of
enormous profits ventured into camp with
small quantities of whisky concealed on their
persons fared rather badly they were sure
to be caught and when they were they were
taken before the commanding officer of the
mounted police who acted as magistrate

  they always got the limit and to make
sure that nothing that was coming to them

heavy for reasons of his own mcleod had
left his red coat in camp so the stranger
setting down the grip with a sigh of relief
mopped the perspiration from his face and
accosted the policeman

   hallo bill working down there  
yep im not feeling well so ive
knocked off for the day

   say i got something here thatll

was overlooked they were sent to some
mounted-police post to serve their sentences
they never tried the game a second time

delivering the goods

  one sweltering august day near broad-
view mcleod who had been up at the front
watching the track-lavers handle steel until
the sight of so much hard work made him
tired was returning to camp when he met a
stranger staggering along under the weight
of a satchc that seemed to be particularly

straighten you out wouldnt you like a
drink

  what ye got  

whisky and brandy twenty-five cents
a drink

 with these words the stranger opened his
 grip which proved to be filled with quart
 bottles encased in cheap socks to keep them
 from rattling on top lay a revolver of die
 largest size

what ye goin to do with that asked
mcleod pointing to the gun

 i tell you what im goin to do with

when they found whisky they
poured it on the thirsty
prairie soil


the railroad mans magazine

the first meddlin- redcoat that lavs hands on me is goin to
get a dose o that

that the first meddlin redcoat that lays
hands on me is goin to get a dose o that
um-ra-m say whatll ye take for
your outfit

  four hundred dollars

  ill give you three hundred if youll
throw in the gun

    its a go

   bring it down to camp and ill give you
the money said mcleod picking up the re-
volver which he pretended to examine with
great interest retaining possession of his
new pistol mcleod led the way back to
camp with the stranger puffing in his wake
crrying the heavy grip it was more than
a mile back to camp there was not a breath
of air stirring and the sun seemed to be try-
ing to drive the mercury out at the top of
the thermometer-tube

  mcleod simulating great anxiety to get
his purchase under cover almost ran all the
way giving the heavily laden stranger no
chance to rest at last the whisky - pedler
dropped the grip and turning purple and
yellow by turns managed to gasp

  wh-wh-why you-youre taking me to
the police station

  sure i am i forgot to tell you that you
are under arrest

  for a time the whisky-
pedler was speechless
when he found his voice
he could only give utter-
ance to incoherent ra-
vings but when he got
right down to it at last
he relieved himself of a
torrent of profanity
winding up by exclaim-
ing

   i dont mind the ar-
rest but to make me lug
this dray-load of liquor
two miles on the double-
quick in this awful
sun- and then he be-
came incoherent again
he was fined two hun-
dred dollars his stock
was confiscated of
course and he was run
out of camp

  ten years later mc-
leod met the former whis-
ky-pedler who in the
accents of one whose grief
while mellowed by time
is none the less poignant
again upbraided his late
captor for making him carry that load of
whisky to the police station

  trofessional gamblers who strayed north-
ward were run out of camp with such en-
thusiasm that they never ventured into can-
ada again a game of poker among the men
however was overlooked provided it was
kept very quiet which meant that the stakes
must be nominal when the end of the track
had reached regina a plan was laid by some
of the men who were suspiciously dexterous
with cards to inveigle the paymaster into a
game of poker and fleece him

 pinching  the paymaster

  mcleod heard of the plot and warned
the paymaster being a knowing young per-
son the paymaster volunteered to take care
of himself without any assistance from the
mounted police notwithstanding this offer
mcleod kept his eye on the paymaster

  when he saw him go into a tent that eve-
ning in the company of the card-sharps he
waited only long enough to allow time for
things to get running smoothly then with
a partner he pushed open the flimsy wooden
door of the tent and fell upon the table so
quickly that lie had scooped a jack-pot
pioneers of the canadian pacific



amounting to four hundred dollars into his
pockets before the poker-party realized what
was going on

  all hands including the wise young pay-
master were taken to the station colonel
steele the commandant was awakened and
sitting on the edge of his cot in his night-
shirt he tried the case then and there im-
posed a fine of fifty dollars on the paymas-
ter and double that amount on the gamblers
then he rolled into bed while the police es-
corted the gamblers out of camp and told
them to keep on going

breaking up a riot

  a riot started by a striking steel gang at
oak lake was suppressed in the same sum-
mary manner it was in the spring when
work was first begun and the men just ar-
rived in camp had managed to smuggle in
enough whisky to start a row

  the nominal cause of the strike of course
was of no consequence sergeant percy of
the mounted police was sixty miles away
when he was notified of the trouble with

four men he boarded an engine and hastened
to the camp

  the first thing the five redcoats did on
reaching the scene of the riot was to get
axes and go through the camp smashing
everything containing whisky when this
was done to their satisfaction they arrested
a few of the ringleaders in the row then
the sergeant and three men went about their
business leaving a solitary redcoat to keep
the drunken camp in order

  he did it too for the magic of a red coat
in preserving the peace is something that
passess the understanding of a free-born
american citizen they are a quiet unpre-
tentious lot of men who never indulge in
any gun-play nor loud talk but everybody
in the northwest knows they are crack shots
when shooting is called for and that the
maxim that is burned into their brains is
that when they are sent to do a thing they
must do it or never show themselves again

  so the single policeman was enough to
quencli the smoldering embers of the riot
next morning the steel gang sobered and
chastened returned to work

sitting on the edge of the cot in his nightshirt he tried the case


the railroad mans magazine

  another volume of the living history of
the canadian pacific who is still hale and
hearty tells the story of the roads narrowest
escape from trouble of a really serious na-
ture he is father lacombe a gray-haired
catholic priest who went into the northwest
as a missionary to the blackfeet indians be-
fore the building of the road had been de-
cided upon

averting a massacre

  the canadian pacific it will be remem-
bered was built without any trouble from the
indians father lacombe is the reason why
there was peace rather than war indians
north of the boundary line were just as blood-
thirsty just as quarrelsome and just as
treacherous as their kinsmen south of it
but in canada catholic missionaries had
gained a wonderful control over them the
indians never would attack a ramp of an-
other tribe if they knew a black robe was
there in all the difficulties between the in-
dians and the government the railroad and
the settlers the black robes rendered invalu-
able assistance

  by the time the construction armyhad
reached medicine hat chief crowfoot and
his tribe of blackfeet had made up their
minds that they did not want a railroad
through their reservation to make sure
that it would not be built fifteen hundred
of them led by crowfoot put on their war-
paint sharpened up their tomahawks and
prepared to run down to medicine hat and
massacre the railroad-builders

  father lacombe hearing what was in the
wind hurried as fast as horseflesh could
carry him to the construction camp and
begged the men to stop work for a day or
two until he could have a chance to pacify
the indians the request was received with
jests and curses and with the assurance that
they did not propose to stop for indians nor
any one else

the black robes advice

  father lacombe could deal with red sav-
ages if not with white ignoring the ribaldry
of the men whose lives he was trying to save
he bought two hundred pounds of sugar and
as many more of tea tobacco and flour
hurrying back to the blackfoot mission he
invited the indians to a council he dis-
tributed the provisions among the chiefs who
were to divide diem among their families
father lacombe knew well how to talk to

indians and he spoke their language per-
fectly said he

  listen to my words if one of you
can say that in the fifteen years i have lived
among you i have given you bad advice
let him rise and say so fearlessly

  not an indian stirred

  well my friends i have a bit of advice
to give you to-day let the white people
pass on your lands and build their railroad
they will not rob you of your lands more-
over these white men obey their chiefs and
it is with the chiefs that the matter must be
settled i have already told these people that
you are not pleased with the way in which
the wrork is pushed on the governor will
come here to arrange with you himself

   he shall listen to your griefs lie shall
propose a remedy and if the compromise
does not suit you it will still be time enough
to order the railroad-builders off your res-
ervation

  crowfoot at once took the floor and de-
clared the advice of the chief of prayer was
good and that it should be followed that
ended the trouble and the railroad-builders
worked on unmolested never realizing how
very near they had come to losing their scalps

president for an hour

  meanwhile father lacombe had tele-
graphed the situation to the authorities and
a few days later lieutenant governor dewd-
ney arrived as promised by the chief of
prayer in exchange for the tract of land
taken for the right of way on the border of
the reservation the indians were given a
strip on the northwest border that fully satis-
fied them

  the canadian pacific railway company
fully appreciated the value of the service the
missionary had rendered in proof of this
father lacombe was made president of the
road though perhaps that fact may not ap-
pear in the archives of the company

  when the first train ran into calgary
which was already a flourishing village in
anticipation of the coming of the road it
was followed closely by the private car of
president george stephen now lord mount
stephen he was accompanied by three presi-
dents of american railroads a number of
english lords and a german count ste-
phens first act on reaching calgary was to
send father lacombe an invitation to take
lunch with him in his car when the good
priest appeared he was unanimously elected
president of the company a position which
pioneers of the canadian pacific	

crowfoot declared the advice of the chief of prayer was good

he filled with satisfaction to all and credit
to himself until the meal was over

  a few hours ride beyond the scene of the
massacre that did not take place there is
another spot that makes the history of the

c	p r still more vivid it was no longer
ago than july   that the first through
train into british columbia stopped at
field a few miles beyond the continental
divide and left a dining-car on the lonely
siding to serve as an eating station until a
hotel could be built another dining-car
was spotted at glacier

pioneer through trains

  sam woods who had already had the
honor of running the first train into port
arthur on lake superior was the conductor
he is now station-master at vancouver and
to all appearances will be able to take charge
of more first trains half a century hence
robert marpole then superintendent in the
mountains is now executive assistant at
vancouver

  the dining-cars were spotted at field and
glacier because it was too difficult to haul
them over the stiff grades in the rocky

mountains and the selkirks on grades of
two and a half to four and a half per cent
all kinds of things were liable to happen
and in fact generally did happen

  for instance the snow in the selkirks has
such a disagreeable way of sliding down the
mountains in great avalanches sweeping
everything before them that one of the first
things the railroad company had to do after
the rails were laid was to build miles of
snow-sheds to protect the tracks

  when the bids were opened the lowest
proved to be offered by william mackenzie
and d d mann mackenzie was the owner
of a little sawmill at donald while mann
was a contractor in an equally small way
neither was overburdened with capital but
the company risked awarding them the con-
tract

  when the snow-sheds were built mac-
kenzie and mann had more money than they
had before besides they worked together
so well that they have kept it up ever since
they are still making history at the head of
the canadian northern railroad which is
spreading through canada like measles in a
boarding-school

the second train that left the pacific

coast for the east was burned with the ex-
ception of the sleeper at six-mile creek on
the eastern slope of the selkirks a bush
fire had set some wood piles alongside the
track ablaze when the train tried to
run past the burning wood-piles the rails
spread and threw engine and train into the
ditch the sleeper alone was not derailed
so crew and passengers got out and pushed it
back out of harms way

conductor babbitts wet ride

  for a fire that was rather tame on mon-
day may   they did a little better
on that day no  was flagged at snow-
shed no  because shed no  near
rogers pass just below the summit of
the selkirks avas on fire a work-train crew
in charge of conductor babbitt was above
shed  fighting the fire they had a flat-
car on which were a couple of wooden tanks
from which they were nimbly throwing
buckets of water on the fire

  about the time the shed which was of
dry pine was in a fine blaze the coupling
broke leaving that tank-car free to start
down the two and a half per cent grade
which it lost no time in doing all hands

  but conductor babbitt jumped from the car
without waiting for formalities as it started
to run into the burning shed those who
had no time to jump just fell off

  conductor babbitt stuck to the flying car
and running for the brake threw his soul
into an effort to stop the car if anybody
can figure out why conductor babbitt want-
ed to stop the car right in the middle of a
blazing snow-shed they are welcome to the
information

  providentially for him the brake like all
other flat-car brakes since the beginning of
time was out of order and would not hold
an ounce

a watery crash

  the car shot through the shed gaining
speed at every turn of the wheels so swiftly
that conductor babbitt came out of the oven
very much underdone in fact he was only
scorched a little down the mountain roared
the car with tidal waves sloshing out of the
tanks and engulfing him every time they
struck a curve and that part of the road
consists exclusively of curves at every in-
undation babbitt would splutter and give
the brake-wheel another twist

the englishmen took up their
position on the pilot
pioneers of the canadian pacific



  he probably would be winding up that
impotent brake-wheel yet if no  had not
been standing on the main-line at shed 
when he saw no  babbitt concluded he
had been heroic enough for one day so he
dropped off

  when the passengers crawled out from
under the seats where they had taken refuge
without any effort on their own part and
went up ahead to investigate they found a
heap of splinters scattered around the engine
which a very wet gentleman said was all
that was left of a tank-car on which he had
been making a tour of the selkirks

  the engine had lost pilot headlight
smokestack sand-box bell and other things
too numerous to mention but engineer
garvin after they had remembered to dig
him out of the debris cobbled her up and
using a water barrel for a smoke-stack she
contrived to limp down hill to donald

  but the favorite classic anecdote of the c
p r which after all these years is still the
piece de resistance wherever old-timers are
in gabfest assembled treats of two english
sportsmen who made the trip east from van-
couver away back in early days

  of course they had heard of the abun-
dance of big game in the mountains so when
conductor mccutcheon casually mentioned
that the train would pass a bare patch near
the base of ross peak they got mixed on
orthography their ideas of a bear patch
apparently was a natural corral filled with
grizzlies at which they could take pot shots

from the train this shows that we should
not too rashly jump at conclusions

  with a great show of reluctance engineer
baldy brown gave permission for the sports-
men to ride on the pilot until they passed the
bare patch attired in strictly correct hunt-
ing costume of the period including double-
ended caps the englishmen took up their
position on the pilot with their elephant guns
at full cock lying across their knees and
their eyes fairly popping out of their heads
as they scanned each foot of ground for the
bear patch or rather the bare patch

  just before they reached this interesting
spot the train entered a tunnel which in
those days leaked abominably at a place
near the center when the pilot was directly
beneath the worst of the downpour the en-
gine came to a standstill

  as they were in inky darkness the sports-
men had to sit there for twenty minutes
with miniature niagaras running down the
backs of their necks listening to baldy
brown abusing the fireman for letting the
steam run down so low

  not until they were well on their way to
london did they recall that they could hear
baldy browns vituperation only half the
time because the roaring of the safety valve
drowned his voice the other half of the time

  those who venture to doubt this story are
shown the identical bare patch that con-
ductor mccutcheon mentioned to the english
sportsmen and the tunnel in which baldy
browns engine died that day

         by augustus wittfeld

     carlock bjones follows a false clue and finds
     that he has been initiated into an ancient order

entered carlocks apartments
and found him swinging in a ham-
mock he gave me a quick glance
and heaved a deep sigh

    why so melancholy   i in-
quired

  my dear watchem he answered  i had
hopes that your afternoon would be at my
disposal but of course since you are going
to the ball-game with emmons i cannot look
for you to assist me in the mysterious case of
o b c osofat

  who told you i am going to the ball-
game i asked

   why watchem he answered  the truth
is self-evident y ou are wearing your somber
garments on a week-day you can have put
them on only for the purpose of lending
color to the yarn you told your chief that
your grandmother is to be buried this after-
noon

   as she has died at least a dozen times to
my knowledge i can deduce but one thing
and that is that the interment will be at the
usual place

   carlock i commented  you are right
but what gets me is that you know i am
going with emmons

    easiest thing out replied carlock
 emmons came in and tried to borrow a dol-
lar from me said he was going to the ball-
game ergo he must be going with you or
he wouldnt have to borrow the money

    carlock i said in amazement  youre
a wonder but tell me why are you swing-
ing in a hammock  

    because i enjoy the suspense he replied
 suspense stimulates the mental faculties
and besides a hammock affords free sway
to the imagination

    have you discovered any clue to the mys-
terious disapipearance of the case of fat-
reducio which was consigned to o b c

osofat and which was lost while in transit
on the pole-to-pole railway i asked

   before answering your query replied
carlock  i wish to refresh your memory
on the subject you remember it was while
i was engaged on the famous case of the gold
coupler that o b c osofat came to me
with the astounding information that a case
of fat-reducio had disappeared in transit
on the pole-to-pole railway

   mr osofat had ordered the preparation
with the idea of reducing his excessive weight
and in anticipation of the results which had
been guaranteed by the manufacturers he
had donated most of his clothing to the home
for obese octogenarians and had ordered a
liberal supply of new ones to fit a man
weighing a hundred pounds less or one
hundred and seventy-six pounds

   the preparation had been consigned to
him by the manufacturers at phanta-smania
and was receipted for in good order by the
pole-to-pole at patrickgonia somewhere
between that point and this city it disappeared
completely the resources of the road have
been exhausted and as a last resort my mar-
velous powers have been enlisted in an effort
to solve the mystery

  mr osofat is one of the largest stock-
holders of the road and consequently the
directors are especially anxious to please him
as they realize that heavy stockholders are
not to be made light of

  carlock paused and opening his medicine-
chest he handed me a pepsin tablet

  what is this for i asked

  take it he replied it will help you
to digest the evidence

  i did as he directed and he continued

  when i took holj of the case there was
absolutely nothing to work on after in-
finite pains i discovered that the baggage-
car of the train that received the case at
the goat degree



patrickgonia was in charge of pud judson
one of the heavy-weight baggage-smashers of
the road i looked up his antecedents and
found that he had lots of first-class records
which he used on his phonograph he was
credited with being as straight as a string
but considerably thicker

   i also discovered that after reaching new
york on that trip pud had disappeared and
was missing for four weeks when he finally
reported for duty he had grown considerably
thinner the cause of his falling-off in
weight has never been explained

   has any one asked him the cause   i
asked

  watchem said carlock reprovingly
will you never learn that it is very un-
ethical to ask a suspect to explain anything
the proper course is to secure evidence or
failing in this to resort to the expedient of
manufacturing evidence to fit the case when
you have succeeded in building up a plausible
theory confront your victim with it and by
judicious work win from him a confession
 as the case now stands i remarked
 what do you make of it 

   by logical deduction i arrive at the con-
clusion that pud judson is responsible for
the disappearance of the case of fat-reducio
and i propose to fasten the crime on him

   but carlock i interrupted  i was not
aware that any crime had been committed
 is it not a crime to deprive a man of
hope   asked carlock  is it not a crime
to rob a man of the anticipated loss of one
hundred pounds of surplus flesh and con-
demn him to carry it through life 

  i had to admit that it was

   i have summoned judson continued
carlock  to report here at three-thirty to-
day and if you want to see something that
has baseball fanning the air i would advise
you to remain

  well i replied since emmons failed
to get the money i guess ill have to take
your advice

  precisely at three-thirty the indicator on
the wall announced that pud judson had
entered the building and was even then on
his way to carlocks apartments in a min-
ute or so the elevator stopped and then there
was a knock at the door carlock opened it
admitting a short emaciated man in a rail-
road mans uniform

  you sent for jne   he asked addressing
the great detective

  i summoned you said carlock be
good enough to note the distinction a pro-
fessional man never sends for any one

  carlock surveyed judson critically having
taken a post-graduate course in surveying at
a correspondence-school suddenly he made
the startling accusation

   judson you are short

  judson cowed

   only a matter of fifty shares or so he
asserted

   i do not refer to your petty market specu-
lations said carlock severely  i refer to
your weight you have lost about a hundred
pounds had you lost this weight in a legit-
imate manner it would not have been neces-
sary for me to summon you but since you
have usurped the loss which should have been
anothers it is my duty to secure from you
a statement of the facts

   i do not know what you mean asserted
judson

   you know that on your last run there was
a case of fat-reducio consigned to o b c
osofat of this city you also know that when
you reached here the case had disappeared

   but why accuse me of knowing what be-
came of it if the case was lost i do not see
how i am to blame for it protested judson

  when you received that case at patrick-
gonia said carlock you were known as
pud judson no one could accuse you of
being entitled to that name now to what
can we attribute your loss of flesh if not to
the fact that you have taken something to
bring about this result 

   i tell you i know nothing about it pro-
tested judson when i arrived at new
york on that run i was a very sick man
my complaint was one that baffled the skill of
the physicians and left me as you see me
now

  judson said carlock do you mean to
say that you did not eat the case of fat-
reducio for the purpose of reducing your
weight  

   i tell you i know nothing about it in-
sisted judson

   judson said carlock  a crime has been
committed and it is necessary that the crim-
inal be found you were in that car alone
with the case of fat-reducio you are known
to have often expressed dissatisfaction with
your excessive weight

   during the long run from patrickgonia
to new york you pondered on this fact and
cast envious eyes at the case which was in-
tended to reduce the weight of o b c oso-
fat you envied him the good fortune which
made it possible for him to indulge in the
luxury of a case of fat-reducio

   in the solitude of your car you sue-


the railroad mans magazine

cumbed to the temptation and when no eye
was on you you ate up that case come
man you may as well admit it i know
what i am talking about

  i did not eat it said judson i was
not in the car alone there was a goat on
board it was consigned to a cattle-show in
kentucky i tell you i know nothing about
it

   watchem said carlock turning to me
 this is the toughest case ive ever tackled
ive got to get an admission out of him at
any cost the directors have ordered me to
mate a report as quickly as possible

  he turned and opening his safe he took
a handful of gold-pieces from his cash-box
placing the gold on the table he addressed
judson

  did you ever see this before

  no replied judson

  it is yours insinuated carlock

  no no moaned judson i wish it
was

   it is yours repeated carlock  come
now like a good fellow admit that you ate
the fat-reducio

  i do not understand wailed judson
 but if you say the money is mine perhaps
i am mistaken perhaps i did eat the fat-
reducio

  the money is yours carlock assured
him  come now admit that you ate the
case of fat-reducio

  mine-all mine exclaimed judson
joyfully yes i think i did eat it

  he picked up the gold-pieces and let them
flow from one hand to the other then he
put them into his pocket

  you did it persisted carlock you
know you did it

  yes i did it said judson wearily

   whew  exclaimed carlock  that was
a tough job twenty minutes by the clock
did you phonograph it watchem 

  yes i replied it is all on record
carlock dismissed judson and proceeded
to transcribe a full report of the confession
he was a lightning operator on the type-
writer and i watched the sparks flying from
the machine as he wrote

  are you not afraid of setting fire to the
paper i asked

  no danger he replied i use asbestos
safety-paper	

  as he finished his labors the postman en-
tered and handed him a large legal-iooking
letter

 carlock passed it to me and asked me to
read it to him

  i broke the seal and opened it clearing
my throat i read

mr carlock bjones new york u s a

    dear mr bjones-we are addressing you
  as the head of the detective staff of the pole-
  to-poie railway and beg to report to you that
  some time since we shipped one of our prize
  fat goats over your road to the kentucky agri-
  cultural fair the goat was a beautiful speci-
  men weighing two hundred and twenty pounds

     shortly after its delivery to the agricultural
  show people it commenced to lose weight and
  in the short space of one week it lost the
  amazing sum of one hundred pounds it is
  needless to note that the goat was unfit for
  show purposes and we were compelled to with-
  draw it

    we determined to investigate the cause of
  this loss in weight and our mr arsenic loo
  ping was assigned to the job with the great-
  est ease he located the man who had charge of
  the baggage-car in which the goat had made the
  trip to kentucky

    he found him in new york suffering from
  a mysterious malady and disguising himself
  as a trained nurse he gained admission into
  the sick-room he was rewarded by learning
  from the delirious ravings of pud judson that
  a case of fat-reducio in the car had been en-
  tirely consumed by our prize fat goat

    we propose to enter suit against the pole-
  to-pole railway for damages sustained by us
  through your carelessness in transporting our
  goat

    mr arsenic loo ping sends you his greet-
  ings and assures you that you will have to
  get up early to beat him

    very sincerely

 carlock i commented it looks to me
as though pud judson has the best of you
there seem to be two goats in this case
no replied carlock bitterly there
is only one im it

observations of a country
station-agent

by j e smith

no -the railroad detective as represented by pat flynn who un-
earthed a hideous crime in a couple of trunks
from chicago

he wise and observing whom we
  have with us always tell us
  that if one would live a hun-
  dred years he must have a fad
  of some kind outside the rou-
  tine of his daily occupation

  pat flynn who aspired to a hundred years
decided as an incidental feature of his exist-
ence-and supplementary to his job in the
livery-stable and off-bearing in the saw-
mill-that he would be a detective

  pat did not want to be a common country
constable handling summonses and serving
notices and trying to stop city automobiles
that streaked through pippenville at a hun-
dred barney oldfields an hour

  he wanted tragic enigmas to go deep into
unravel  and apprehend he wanted to
hist and aha

  when the railroad found pat he was
night-watchman or to put it with more dig-
nity merchant police in the town of pippen-
ville at a salary of seven dollars a week paid
by the voluntary subscription of the bank
the hardware merchant the general store the
lumber-dealer and others

  his duties were to go up and down the
main street in the grave-vawning hours with
an occasional sly sortie in the next alley back
and see that neither vandal nor buccaneer
disturbed the peace or property of the vil-
lage

the railroad mans magazine

  for the police surveillance pat fully
equipped himself by sending five dollars to
a detective bureau at cincinnati ohio and
received by return mail a pewter badge and
credential papers with flamboyant seal no-
tifying all concerned that the  aforesaid pat-
rick flynn was appointed duly qualified
and fully authorized to detect anything any-
where whatsoever or whomsoever

  thereupon he detected a new job paying
forty dollars per month - baggage-master at
the depot

  pat made out his application for the place
in a stout round hand and indicated a stur-
dy ancestry back to bailyhooly cork coun-
ty ireland

  now being station baggage - master at a
way station is not altogether what one would
term a flossy job

  all the -pound sample trunks weigh
 pounds and every month your  anxious-
to-please uncle samuel adds another rnail-
sack besides there are records to keep and
janitor work to do

  the forty dollars allured pat but his
heart was not in the work

  his natural bent was for police duty had
he not already paid his five dollars and qual-
ified as a detective

  again hist and aha

  but pippenville was  field for sher-
locking there were not people enough and
there was no crime one cannot run down
and apprehend when there is nothing but the
idle persiflage of old womens tongues

  pat went to the railroad to broaden his
opportunities

  railroads need the keen penetrating vision
of the trained detective there are mystery
cases on the railroad every day and pat saw
his opportunity

  when the company learned he was a de-
tective with papers indicating it substan-
tiating it and notifying all concerned that
he had the authority and cooperation of the
national detective association of porkop-
olis to run down whatever was dark and
dank he would not long remain in pippen-
ville as baggage-master they would- call
for him for secret-service duty

  that was why pat went after the job as
station baggage-master

  the branch line from the prairie connects
with the trunk line for chicago at pippen-
ville a great deal of baggage and mail is
transferred between the two

  pat adjusted to his duties quickly enough

  then he began snooping about for crime
double-dealing and mystery

  it came quickly enough

  one day pat unloaded two truck-loads of
baggage off the branch on one of the
trucks were four shoe-trunks all alike

  pat checked his baggage with the train-
baggagemans way-bill every check num-
ber corresponded and the pieces tallied he
signed up for all of it mailed his receipt for
it and loaded up the greater part of the bag-
gage on the chicago train

  the shoe-trunks with some other pieces
were checked to pippenville these he al-
lowed to remain on the truck at the west end
of the depot

  within an hour the drayman came after
the shoe-cases and gave pat four duplicates

  when pat went out to deliver them he
found but two trunks but a strap-check
hung on each end of each trunk to match the
four duplicates he found four checks dan-
gling on two pieces of baggage

  pat had a hazy recollection of there being
four of them when he unloaded them and
lie was certain he did not load two of them
on the chicago train nevertheless he ar-
rived at the swift conclusion that there had
been but two in the first place detectives
think quickly he removed the four checks
and delivered the two trunks to the dray-
man

  this brought the shoe-man to the depot in
a hurry

   im short two of my trunks brother
he insisted and i need them right this
minute

  you aint short nothing answered pat
them two trunks was checked twice and
thats four four checks and only two
trunks see

  aint short anything yelled the shoe-
man dont i know how many trunks i
carry didnt i check four at holton
didnt i see the agent load em didnt i
see em unloaded on your truck didnt i
count em  one two three four before i
went up-town

  now youve delivered two of them to
some one else or you have loaded them out
for chicago get busy brother get busy
i want em i want em bad i want em
this minute

  you aint got but two trunks persisted
pat doggedly detectives must be firm as
well as nimble-witted  but theys checked
twice a check on each end four checks
on two trunks see  

   have you delivered any trunks to any
one else  

  no sir
observations of a country station-agent	

cago

 then you put them on the train for chi- ends-see then you come here and claim
 f	four trunks its a slick scheme to beat the

company youre a swindler but pat

   i did not  responded pat firmly  i
did not load any slioe-trunks on the train for
chicago you had them trunks checked
twice thats four one check on each
end thats four two trunks-four checks
aint that plain enough

  the shoe-man made threatening gestures
under pats nose

  no use to talk to you he howled

flynn-

  pat did not get any further he was about
to say that pat flynn had solved the mys-
tery and exposed the plot but the fourth of
july came so suddenly and they touched off
the fireworks all at once and the pin-wheel
went buzzing around at such a rate that pat
did not complete his deductions when he

j nokmam lmmo -

they bound him securely and led him away

youre a muckle-head you dont know
anything ill go after the officials by tele-
graph ill get them and theyll get you
this line of talk ruffled pat and brought
out a hot retort when a man has ancestral
tracing to ballyhooly cork county ireland
and detective credentials besides hes bound
to come back

   look here  said pat  dont make
motions around me you dont know who
youre talking to look here

  pat displayed a glimpse of the pewter
badge

  see this paper membership national
detective association i see through this
case you got em checked twice-on both

came to the brutal shoe-man had gone up-
town

  pat had taken the count

  the controversy and investigation raged
with vigor for many days

  pat was firm and loud in his theory of
four checks and two trunks and he backed
it by the signed credentials of the national
detective association and by the weight of
his pewter badge

  the mystery was not solved the shoe-
man made good his claim the company
could not find the trunks and finally paid
for them

  pat flynn expostulated and protested but
was overruled and censured he had to


the railroad mans magazine

stand aside mute and helpless while the
company  came across  with the where-
withal

  pretty tough isnt it when one has full
detective power and has solved the mystery
and then have all concerned coolly turn down
the expert deciphering

this delicate job was performed
with all the gentility con-
sistent with safety

  pat was somewhat humiliated and dis-
couraged but it was not long before oppor-
tunity again gently tapped at the baggage-
room door and pat promptly answered the
call

  this time it was big game-same as
rhinos in africa

  a desperate criminal had successfully
eluded the police of chicago

  pat lit his pipe one day and sat down on
a brass-trimmed double-strapped trunk

which he had just unloaded from the chi-
cago train and trucked into the baggage-
room

  then he opened the daily howl and
scanned the three-inch head-lines with eager
interest he gave a hasty glance at the po-
litical doings none at all at the editorial

lthd

conjecture but landed without delay or fur-
ther ado upon the sporting page

  exhausting that mine he returned to the
particulars of a revolting crime that was baf-
hing the police of chicago

  a beautiful young woman had mysterious-
ly disappeared and the theory was that she
had been murdered dismembered and the re-
mains concealed in a trunk and carted away
in the night

   baldy  brewer was suspected and want-
ed by the police

  the trunk was described as brown brass-
trimmed and double-strapped

  pat jumped three feet straight up and
landed in the middle of the baggage-room
while gooseflesh sensations played up and
down his spine

  the paper fell from his hand he was
sitting on it-the brass-trimmed double-
strapped brown trunk just from chicago

  there it was no doubt about it

  pats system was surcharged with suspi-
cion he went outside and leaned heavily
observations of a country station-agent



against the depot fanned himself with his
cap and gathered his thoughts

   theres a reward for  baldy  brewer
all right he mused  heres where pat
flynn gets his picture in the papers and a
wad of money too and makes his reputa-
tion

  in another moment a train came in on
the branch line and pat unloaded another
trunk he trucked it into the baggage-room
and dumped it beside the other then he
stared in astonishment they were exact
duplicates each brass-trimmed double-
strapped and brown

  thats only a happen-so pat solilo-
quized  it has no bearing on the case

  again he read the particulars in the chi-
cago papers and corroborated every detail
of the description of the trunk

  the hackmen and passengers departed
no one claimed the baggage pat was
alone

  he turned the trunks over but there were
no telltale marks then he speculated on
the crime

  no doubt the trunks would be called for
what would he do what assurance had he
that one of them was  baldy  brewers and
contained a corpse none at all it might
be however there was a possibility

  pat reached behind the counter and
brought forth a hatchet

  there was a reward of course-a big re-
ward for information leading to the capture
of baldy brewer

   it was pats duty as a detective to inves-
tigate to prowl and pry and prod wherever
there was suspicion

  would faint-hearted indifference lead him
to let this opportunity slip from his grasp

  pat brandished the hatchet in answer and
locked the door to prevent interruption
then he forced the lock and hurriedly un-
buckled the straps

   he raised the lid cautiously gave a quick
peep and dropped it with the suddenness of
an electric shock

  he staggered to the door flung it open
and again leaned against the baggage-room
pale and excited

  he had caught the glimpse of the top of a
womans head-a scalp covered with fine
wavy brown hair

  his heart beat hard and fast he strug-
gled for breath not for some minutes did he
venture inside to restrap the trunk and tap
the lock to its proper place

  then he straightened up with a start to
the discovery that he had opened the wrong

trunk-the one that had come in on the
branch line instead of the one from chi-
cago

    the discovery confused him and led him
 to the wildest speculations

    was there a corpse in each trunk had
 baldy brewer committed a double crime

    pat was emboldened to further investiga-
 tion he looked into the other trunk and
 forthwith slammed the lid down in great
 haste and hurriedly buckled the straps

    the glance revealed the calf of a leg
 flesh-tinted and well-rounded

    he rushed to the telegraph-office and sent
 this message

 chief of police chicago

    what reward for the capture of baldy
 brewer and for recovery of body of his victim

                         patrick flynn

 in due time this answer came back

 patrick flynn

     two hundred dollars for information lead-
 ing to baldy brewers arrest

                           chief of police

                                                  

 pat sought the town marshal

 i reckon said pat diplomatically if
 you was called on to help me arrest a pro-
 fessional criminal youd show the white
 feather

  would i   retorted the marshal with
 scorn  id like to have the chanct

  youll get it all right said pat eager-
 ly  this very afternoon down at the de-
 pot an hes a bad actor youll duck
 though ill bet you ten dollars on that you
 aint got the nerve

 in rebuttal to this insinuating taunt the
 marshal threw out his chest and displayed
 the butt of a bulldog revolver all of which
 indicated that he was the man for desperate
 undertakings

 what is it pat he asked with cau-
 tious whisper

 pat drew him aside

 a store was robbed at salem last night
 and the plunder is at the depot in two
 trunks said pat with easy invention

  when the thief calls for em you nab him
 -see dont let him run any bluff on you
 and dont give him any chanct to get the
 drop on you hes bad-do you mind ill
 file a affidavit against him all you got to
 do is to hold him till they come after him
 theys ten dollars in it for you

  id better get constable cherry hadnt


the railroad mans magazine

i   asked the marshal in a tone of wise
precaution

  three of us ought to handle him all
right returned pat

  the officer made off in gum-booted wari-
ness to marshal his aid and pat returned to
the station congratulating himself that the
secret was safe and the others engaged in
the legal undertaking of apprehending  bal-
dy brewer were ignorant of the real crime
and the character of the criminal

  when the formidable battalion of police
in jerkies homespun and one lone tin star
was arrayed in military attention in the bag-
gage-room awaiting with some palpitation
the arrival of baldy brewer pat ad-
dressed it

   whin you nab im hold right on to im
dont pay any attention to wat he says
these trunks aint to be opened till the offi-
cers comes no matter wat he says are in
em aint any guesswork whats in em i
know see

   after a breathless hour and a series of ap-
prehensive hists portending the culmi-
nation of the enterprise the police force
from its various corners of vantage heard
the approach of pats footsteps and the ring
of his voice

   come right along in the baggage-room
with me your trunks inside we want to
get the right one you know dont want any
mistake

  the door opened pat stepped aside and
the unsuspecting culprit walked directly into
the trap or rather he used a cane and
came with a shambling limp-a sort of
squeaky protest from the ankle

  the minions of the law pounced upon
him it was an unexpected onslaught he
got in one random blow with his cane by
way of resistance and landed with a re-
sounding whack on pat flynns pate

  but they bound him securely and led him
away fighting protesting and profaning
like a demon

   as the lock was broken on the village cala-
boose they confined him in a room at the inn
under a heavy guard of village constabulary

  soon a fleet-footed messenger came from
pat flynn summoning the marshal again to
the station in great haste a female accom-
plice had appeared upon the scene and was
claiming the other trunk

  they took her in custody this delicate
job was performed with all the gentility
consistent with safety

   you are under arrest blurted the mar-
shal seizing her by the arm

   help  she shrieked and fell over n a
faint

  she shrieked explosively for her false
teeth fell out and the awkward official
struggling for his balance stepped on them

  she came to in the parlor of the inn
she was hysterical and belligerent by turns

  the officer sought to pacify her by as-
suring her that by evening officers would be
there and if she was not implicated in any
way she would be liberated and that she was
only held  suspicion for a short time

    where are my teeth   she shrieked wild-
ly you puppy you imp youll thuf-
fer for thith outrage you contemptible thug
-you brute-where are they i thay  

   it was an accident mum i stepped on
em you let em fall out

  a heartrending wail went up

  the marshal blinked in confusion and
backed out toward the door he would have
flown but the stern duty of the law bade
him remain the woman pounced upon him
in a paroxysm of rage and slapped his face
witli a ringing smack then she sank into
a chair and wailed hysterically

  the burden of her lamentation was her
teeth twelve pearly teeth-the ivory en-
semble that artistically robbed the face of ten
or fifteen years-were gone and there was no
consolation

  but her emotion had degrees and soon she
was sobbing more rationally

  in the meantime the marshal with the
instincts of a sleuth had secreted a sharp-
eared constable behind a piece of furniture
the alleged  baldy  brewer was brought
down into the parlor and the two arrested
partners in crime were left alone with numer-
ous guards and sentries at every possible exit
on the outside

  the secreted deputy listened with open
mouth inhaling vast quantities of subter-
ranean lint and almost rupturing his tym-
panum in the effort to catch incriminating
confidences passing between the pair

  for a time no words were spoken pres-
ently the man asked

  are vou the landlady

  thir

  are vou the landlady

  dont you belong here

brought me here oh dear i dont know

never seen each other but weve wrote each
other for a long spell

  indeed indeed how romantic tell
me about her-pleath do 

   shes rich and shes beautiful too some-
how i just naturally picked her out when i
read her ad in the matrimonial bulletin
i aint got nothin agin a woman just cause
shes got money but ever man likes em
purty an a purty woman with money aint
to be run acrost every day

   she writes a mighty good letter an so
do i ar it didnt take us long to find out
we was made for each other i just kind a
felt she was my divinity as they say
how do you know thes tho rich

   she dont say so right out but she
hints at it purty often she dont want her
property to have anything to do with our
affairs she wants to be loved for herself
alone

  a lady about my age i prethume

   oh no he came back briskly  shes
about twenty years younger than you are
shes somewhere between thirty - five and
forty

  the woman came upright with a ierk
thir i dont thank you for thoth in-
thinuations  she retorted then she put
her handkerchief to her eyes and sobbed
with ladylike softness she audibly lamented
the loss of her teeth

  after an assuaging silence the man spoke
up brave and conciliatory

  teeth do make a difference in any
ones appearance thats a fact if i was
you an was goin to meet some one and
cared for my appearance do you know what
id do

   what would you do   she asked ea-
gerly

   just as quick as they let me out id go
and see a dentist maybe hes got a second-
hand set you could use an that you could
rent cheap

  the woman started

   the idea thir  she exclaimed

  the man seeing the need of propitiating
words went on breezily

   of course we all need some fixin up
to make us just right now take me youd
think i was about the article but i dont
mind tellin you i got one leg off maybe
you noticed my ankle squeak when i step
its artificial thats why i got another that
fits better an i dont even limp with it but
i only wear it when i dress up

  doth the lady know that you have but
one---limb 

   sure not i never told her thats a
personal matter only concerns me you
know same as bein bald an- im that too
-maybe you noticed people cant help
them things i argue theyre personal-en-
tirely personal an dont concern any one
else take yourself for instance your hairs
purty scant thats your own lookout
see

  the woman involuntarily put her hand to
the knot of thin hair on the back of her head

  have you ever been married before
she asked

   ill tell you true you seem to be inter-
ested ive been married two times i got
six children an the oldest ones thirteen i
argue thats personal too dont concern
anybody but me

   and you never told the lady  

   its a personal matter mum i didnt
mention it of course not if shes a good
woman shell be glad to take care of em
if she aint a good woman i dont lose any-
thing do i i dont ask her about her
personal matters we just took each other
an thats enough

   i dare thay the lady will thertainly be
thurprithed

  maybe she will and maybe she wont
what if you find she isnt pretty and
hasnt any money

  id think she fooled me purty bad if she
wasnt rich

  but what do you mean by rich dont
you know thir a womans riches are her
affections that the wealth she brings is in
her heart and that her full love is opulence
enough for any man  

   may be so mum but ive been married
before an im past thirty-five and for my
part ill take em even time when they have
the real samoleons

  the woman settled back in her chair she
emitted a melancholy and despairing sigh
and a long silence fell upon the pair

  the train came in from chicago two
detectives arrived and were at once closeted
in the ding baggage-room with pat flynn
and the town marshal

  pat unbuckled the trunks with nervous
hand they crowded close to inspect the
gruesome contents pat turned his head he
felt sickened

  ha exclaimed one of the lynx-eyed
detectives  human teeth here on the floor
one incisor two premolars

  the marshal was about to explain but
just then the trunk lid was lifted

  with firm hand the detective pulled out
observations of a country station-agent



and held up an artificial leg the other
trunk yielded a wig of womans hair-brown
wavy and beautiful

  there were many other articles for the
make-up and embellishment of the human
figure male and female and that was the
extent of the horrors

  the marshal bearing the glad tidings of
liberty hastened to the inn

  he found the woman in a half-fainting
condition and muttering something about
 the end of loves young dream

tective whom the thieves had bamboozled by-
switching the checks before making away
with the loot

  then came formal complaints and law-
suits from the man with the cork leg and the
toothless woman

  strange terms came to tat flynns ears
such as false imprisonment assault shock
humiliations property damage alienation of
affections breach of promise etc

  the badged and credentialed patrick dis-
appeared

they crowded close to inspect the gruesome contents

   you see explained the man  its this
way mr officer by and by she asks me
if i will tell her the name of the lady i
was expecting and was talking about so
i up and tells her - gwendolyn hortense
yvethersby

   it just seemed to kind o squelch her
then it just struck me all of a sudden-by
thunder-thats her an say i want to git
out of here on the first train to chicago
seven oclock aint it ill say for her she
wants to catch the first train out on the branch
-an thats no josh either

  on the day following carpenters made
some repairs on the high platform west of
the baggage-room and they found two shoe-
trunks concealed thereunder

  there they had been secreted and rilled at
leisure under the very nose of p flynn de-

  he did not part from the railroad linger-
 ingly and regretfully but he went like a
 meteorite

  when he landed he was a hundred miles
 away where a brick-yard job claimed him at
 once

  so for the last time  hist  and
  aha

  as for fads-one parting word

   there are only two safe ones for a railroad
 man one is the chicken-ranch the other is
 the fruit-farm

  these are so far removed so inaccessibly
 in the future so entirely impossible and
 harmless diat they merely stir the fancy and
 cannot endanger the job

  never  fad  in the same orbit with the
 job

nerve in the tower

by peter mulligan

the true story series notwithstanding the interlocking
switches and automatic safety devices in every big railway terminal the man in
the tower has many experiences when the lives of scores of passengers and
trainmen depend on his capacity for keeping a clear head and carrying out orders
without the slightest deviation in cases of emergency the train-despatcher
sometimes comes to his aid with instructions but as shown in the case of tower-
man mcmanus there is frequently no time to wait for orders and then only a
quick wit and a steady nerve can be depended on to prevent a smash-up

    a mistake of a train-despatcher can often be rectified before it is too late
but where the trains are speedingby at a mile a minute the men who shift
the levers are given no alternative but to keep their eyes open and be ready
to do the right thing at the right moment very few of the traveling public are
aware of the existence of the man in the little tower beside the track neverthe-
less he is there behind his bank of bristling levers shunting the trains back and
forth over the web of tracks like so many giant shuttles playing a part in the
safety of modern railroad travel that the layman might do well to study

series began in the october  railroad mans magazine single copies  cents

        twenty-three all copy
the monotonous measured
clicks of the telegraph instru-
ments that bind a railroad
division into one unit began
talking to the tower men
scattered along the nine miles of track that
stretch through the new york centrals
yards in the heart of new york city all
day and all night such orders came to them


nerve in the tower



little sat as if he were frozen

enty-second and ninety-sixth streets notify
workmen 

  this was unnecessary the operators were
already on the move but the despatcher was
leaving nothing to chance

  set blocks on everything

  long before the message was finished the
operators were at the levers throwing switch-
es setting signals and tying up traffic in the
long tunnel that runs under park avenue
for almost fifty blocks for to each tower man
had come an understanding of what might
happen in that tunnel as the wild engine
passed through

  within were three hundred men laying
the third rail for the electric system now in
use hearing an engine coming from the
terminal they would instinctively step on the
in-bound track but that was the very
track over which the wild engine was sweep-
ing

a mysterious runaway

  how the engine ever got loose is a mys-
tery that has never been solved it hap-
pened three years ago but there are men
connected with the terminal who still have
cold shivers at the thought that it might hap-
pen again

  the engine had just brought in train no
 due at the grand central station at half
an hour after midnight when unhooked
according to custom it was backed down to
the coal-pit to be made ready for the first
run in the morning it was the sort of thing
that is done every hour of the day in all rail-
road terminals

  but somehow-and here is the mystery-
it suddenly developed one hundred and
eighty pounds of steam all it could carry
and started out through the yards

  lou smitten who for twelve years had
been a fireman on the empire state express
and was at this time yard-conductor saw it
start but although he had only a few steps
to take and took them on the dead run he
missed the runaway

warning the workmen

  his fingers were just able to scratch the
tender as he hurled himself forward in a
desperate effort to catch the hand-rail and
then he rolled over and over in the cinders
the engine meanwhile was picking up
speed at every revolution of the wheels and
was now beyond catching

  the whole yard heard it go out roaring
its steam was up to the limit and behind it
trailed a white feather from the safety-valve

  there was but one thing to do-clear the
track this was no easy thing in a terminal
where there is almost a train a minute even
at that time of night the tracks were loaded
with traffic dead against which the engine
was running wild

  in tower no  was william little extra
night despatcher the moment he saw the
engine he jumped to the instrument and sent
out the message that suddenly filled the
tower men all along the line with galvanic
action

  as he opened the key the engine was
already passing and going close to fifty miles
an hour it had but four short blocks to run


the railroad mans magazine

when it would be in the tunnel within that
time the operator at fiftieth street had to tie
up traffic and save the lives of the fifty men
who were only a short distance inside

  seizing his megaphone as he ran he
leaped down the tower stairs and entered the
tunnel at the same instant as the engine
which was close beside him fortunately
the megaphone threw the sound of his voice
forward so that it was plainly heard above
the noise of the runaway

  jump to other track quick he yelled

an impending catastrophe

  the men were on the track on which they
felt secure but his sharp command made

  ml

them obey instinctively they jumped into
what they had every reason to believe was
certain death then there was a flash a
roar and the wild engine rushed by

  the tunnel was lined with safety appar-
atus torpedoes were automatically pushed
on the track gongs were set ringing slap-
signals intended to break the glass in an en-
gineers cab pounded futilely on the tender
and within the engine itself there was a
cab-signal ringing frantically the noise in
the tunnel was deafening

  at fifty-ninth seventy-second and nine-
ty-sixth streets there was a somewhat lon-
ger length of time in which to warn the work-
men but instead of this being an advantage
it caused the operators difficulties which the
tower man at fiftieth street by the very sud-
denness of his command was able to avoid

the workmen thought the operators were
mistaken and stopped to argue but the bed-
lam of noise coming up the track awakened
them to the fact that there was really some-
thing unusual going on and they saw their
danger in time to jump out of the way of
three hundred men at
work on the tracks not
one was hurt

  at n i n e t y - sixth
street the track leaves
the tunnel and at one
hundred and sixth -
only a few seconds
travel for the speeding
engine-it is supported
on an elevated structure
far above the streets of
harlem approaching
one hundred and
sixth street from the
north on the same
track was the pough-
keepsie local which
had already left one
hundred and twenty-
fifth street station be-
fore the engine wrent
wild the local was
gathering speed and
was doing its best because it was late

here was a problem to which the men in
tower no  were keenly alive and to them
it seemed that there was no way to prevent
a collision crowding behind despatcher
little who sat cool and keen with his fin-
ger on the instrument they cried

ditch her ditch her for heavens
sake man ditch her 

for one second little sat as if he were

his fingers were just
able to scratch the
tender
nerve in the tower



frozen but during that second there passed
through his head the whole panorama of
the situation if he listened to the clamor
of the older men behind him he felt certain
that the ditched engine would jump the wall
of the embankment and smash down into the
street

the devil and the deep sea

  that he dared not risk for he knew not
how many people might be in the street be-
low but the alternative was hardly better
a picture of a head-on collision with the
poughkeepsie local flashed into his mind as
the older men kept calling to him frantically

  ditch her ditch her

  there was one chance left and he meant
to take it if he failed it meant everlast-
ing disgrace success lay only in providing
for other troubles farther up the line but
there would be time enough to think of the
other troubles

  not to follow the unanimous demands of
the others took strength of purpose but lit-
tle although he was only twenty-three years
old did not hesitate

  the situation was in fact worse than the
others realized there was almost a min-
ute to get the poughkeepsie local to one
hundred and sixth street where it would be
switched to another track if this could be
done all well and good but here a third
difficulty blocked his way a dead train on
the other track was coming in on passenger
schedule and if it reached one hundred and
sixth street at the same time as the pough-
keepsie local the cross-over would result in
another and hardly less disastrous collision

  but within the second that all these alter-
natives shot through his mind in spite of
the cries of  ditch her ditch her  he saw
his way clear

  shut up mind your own business
he roaredt though afterward he did not
know he had opened his mouth his mind
was on the order he was about to give to
kid mcmanus the tower man at one
hundred and sixth street

one wreck averted

 meanwhile mcmanus was doing some
thinking on his own part all the alterna-
tives that passed through littles mind shot
in hot waves through his own he like all
the other operators had received the original
message and he knew that there was no time
to lose he could see the poughkeepsie

local so close to him that it hardly seemed
safe to throw the switch before it but he
had received orders to clear the track and it
had to be done

  at full speed the local took the cross-over
and shook and swayed as if it was going to
leave the rails but to mcmanus it seemed
to be crawling down the track he could see
the wild engine coming and made bets with
himself as to whether the local or the engine
would win as the last car passed he swung
the lever and closed the track before the wild
engine had it been five seconds earlier it
would have struck the last coach and gone
over the embankment into the street

  then mcmanus had time to think but to
little the problem that the wild engine pre-
sented was one bristling with difficulties the
other men in tower no  held their tongues
now principally because they felt certain
that he would ditch the engine as it ran into
the mott haven yard but here again lit-
tle knew he dared not ta e the risk

  there was a tower directly in front of the
only feasible place at which to derail it and
as it stood under an embankment with the
tower man almost on a level with the track
the engine would plunge straight through it
to order the tower man to ditch the en-
gine would have been asking him to kill
himself

some quick lever work

  another possibility came to his quick wits
and while the engine going faster than a
mile a minute went a distance of twenty-
four blocks in less than two minutes he
raised the operator at white plainsj on the
new york new haven and hartford which
also runs through the mott haven yard to
learn what tracks were clear on his division

  the answer came immediately but to
make the proper switches at mott haven
required the few remaining seconds instead
of giving the whole order at once to the
tower man as he would have done under
ordinary circumstances little called for
switch after switch to be thrown and before
the last was closed the engine was already
slamming from track to track

  but the rails as if by magic jumped to
place ahead of it taking it safely on a zig-
zag course through a yard that was full of
moving cars and switch-engines until it
struck a long stretch of open track out
through the bronx along which it was al-
lowed to run until its steam gave out

altogether that engine traveled about


the railroad mans magazine

twenty miles making the first nine of them in
eleven minutes which is much faster than
the time made on any schedule over the same
piece of track

  for that ten minutes work-little was
made chief despatcher and although he is
only twenty-six now he is known as one of
the most efficient men connected with the
telegraph end of any railroad in this country

   among telegraphers his feat is regarded as
the quickest piece of work ever done by a
despatcher the telegrapher who told me
the story who was one of the men in the
tunnel said that the name of mcmanus
however should not be forgotten either for
he also showed a quick wit and a steady
nerve if he had waited for little to tell him
to make the cross-over there would not have
been time

  cases where tower men by independent
thoughthave averted wrecks occur much more
frequently than any one knows of but since
disaster is prevented and the trains go on
their way unharmed the facts rarely become
public

where the tracks crossed

  the greenport express was bowling along
the main line of the long island railroad
only a short time ago and was slamming
through station after station with all signals
set at clear -there was apparently nothing
in the road and nothing was expected to
block its progress for it had the right of way

  after leaving westbury as it neared the
end of the run there was no stop short of
jamaica and the engineer began to pick up
speed for the final spurt he rattled through

mineola new hyde park went by in a blur
and now well in his stride he shot by flo-
ral park as if there were no such station on
the map

  it was only fifteen miles to long island
city and the journey would be over in a few
minutes but while no one on the train from
the engineer to the most complacent passen-
ger had any thought of trouble a trap was
being set that all but turned the train into a
shambles

  a local from hempstead loaded down with
passengers and late pulled into floral park
and stopping with its coaches immediately
across the main line began to unload them
the passengers thronged over the track with
no knowledge or fear of the greenport ex-
press and the scene was set for a slaughter-
house worst of all the man whose business
it was to prevent the greenport express from
smashing through the local felt as secure
about the matter as any one

  it was a case where the automatic signal
was not expected to give warning that was
the affair of towerman d a sharp and he
having set the signals against the greenport
express turned unconcernedly to watch the
crowd his duty was done he had set the
signal and there was nothing more for him
to do but wait to send the semaphore-blades
to clear after the hempstead train had pulled
out he knew the greenport express was due
and he looked up the track casually

signals that failed

  as he gazed his eyes suddenly stared in
terror and his blood ran cold there was
not a semaphore at danger as far as he could
see

whirling to the levers in a panicky fear
that he had altogether forgotten the signal
he seized the handle and pulled at it use-
lessly it was over in the right position

he did not know it but the hempstead
train standing across the main line had de-

 sav  are you alive down there  
nerve in the tower



veloped some defect in the wiring and caused
a short-circuit that had put out of commis-
sion the whole signal system for several
blocks

  under such circum-
stances a man with-

o	u t initiative would
have been lost all
that he was accus-
tomed to rely on as
infallible had abso-
lutely failed him an
earthquake-shock or a
bolt out of the sky
could not have found
him less prepared in
such emergencies the
average man fails but
here sharp showed his
metal the moment he
saw that the signals
would not work he
was down the stairs
in a jump running
up the track waving
a flag and gesticula-
ting wildly with both
his arms

 shes got to
stop  he said

  by this time the
express was spinning
past semaphore-poles
that should have been
an absolute bar and
by the time the en-
gineer saw sharp
there was barely
enough time for him
to shoot on the air
and jerk the train to a
as if it had struck eternity

  inside the passengers complained among
themselves at the jarring they received but
a few minutes later when their train con-
tinued on its way to new york no one noticed
the young man in the tower who had just pre-
vented a wreck in which a score of people
might have been killed

a train on his back

  among telegraphers these stories circulate
but the world at large knows nothing of them
there is hardly a tower man in this country
who has not at some time been called upon
to take quick action

  an instance famous within the profession
but never told outside would have made a

hero of a a leonard now one of the best-
known men in the business but to his fellow
telegraphers who are the only ones who ever
heard it it was all part of the days work

  when he was a boy
just learning to read
morse and holding
down an operators
job at barree on the
middle division of the
pennsylvania
he averted a wreck
that would have gone
down in history had
it occurred like most
railroad stations the
one at barree was
built with a bow-
window so that the
operator could look
up and down the
track and in this
window leonard was
one day sitting un-
knowingly awaiting
the most thrilling mo-
ment in his life

  a fast east - bound
freight was pounding
past ten feet in front
of him hurrying to
reach a siding two
hundred yards down
to clear the way for
the mail - train no
 which was due in
five minutes sudden-
ly right before him a
car slumped down on
the track with a bro-
ken axle that began tearing up the ties
while a flagman who was passing over the
top leaped wildly into the air after that
for fifteen seconds there were plenty of things
happening

  the car behind the one with the broken
axle turned sharply at right angles reared
and made a bolt directly through the waiting-
room catching johnny clemons the station-
agent in the back and shooting him sur-
prised but unhurt through the back door

  the next came quartering caught the bow-
window before leonard had a chance to
move and cut it away from the building
before the piling-up had finished there were
seventeen freight-cars within four car-lengths
of track and somewhere under the wreck was
leonard

  cut bruised shaken like a rat and all

standstill it stopped


the railroad mans magazine

but unconscious leonard knew what was
happening to him but it seemed as if addi-
tional cars would never cease piling up
on top when they stopped to his great
surprise he realized he was still alive al-
though he had ever- reason to believe that
he ought to be dead

  he tried to think but his head was hum-
ming so that he could hardly collect liis
thoughts he also felt as if he had lost a
part of his body but he soon discovered that
he was intact though his arm was wedged
upward at an angle that caused him excru-
ciating pain

  in his head was a jumble of something
vaguely connected with the flagman he had
seen jump he seemed to be having a night-
mare and could not collect his evasive ideas

  through his pain after the prolonged
agony of a minute it came to him-no 
the flagman was probably dead what
could he do where he lay it might take
them hours to dig him out

  above his head his hand felt free and in
the hope that some one might see it he wig-
gled his fingers to expect his hand to be
seen through the wreck of seventeen cars was
ridiculous but it was the only chance he had

  johnny clemons had by this time regained
the breath that had been knocked out of him
and rushed back inside the station-house to
see what had become of leonard the first
thing he noticed in the pile of wreckage was
that feebly waving hand it was battered
and bleeding and seemed to be giving some
ghastly signal

  he began to pull at the wreckage but
making no headway he called out

   say are you alive down there 

  leonard heard as if he had yelled in his
ear there was only a piece of timber and
some rubbish between

  you bet im alive he answered but
dont mind me look out for 

  then clemons was gone and after an
eternity of suffering he returned and dug
leonard out meanwhile he had stopped the
passenger-train and saved a score of lives
but all the passengers ever knew about it was
that there had been a wreck down the track
and their train had been delayed several
hours

  there are a surprising number of tramp

operators working over the length and breadth
of the country and although they might be
regarded as too easy-going to bear the respon-
sibility that is placed upon them it is seldom
that one-of them fails also now and then
one gets an opportunity to play a heroic part
and a chance to make good it is in a time
of stress that such men always arise to the
emergency

  at albion illinois on a cold and stormy
night last february a tramp operator took
charge of the traffic for the southern railway
he had just landed the job and was par-
ticularly glad to be back to the key and
form a part again of the never-ending life of
the railroad the good-fellowship of the
passing train-crews warmed his heart and
he made up his mind to stick to his job

  he bubbled over with good feeling and
rubbed his hands so much that he did not
get down to the rather immediate business
of learning the schedule and before he ex-
pected it an engine swirled out of the storm
trailing behind it a string of brightly lighted
coaches filled with passengers with the
snow rail-high deadening the noise it slipped
in upon him unnoticed but the moment he
saw it pulling out he realized that he had
an order to hold it on the siding

  he rushed outside lantern in hand but
only a passenger or two saw the lantern and
to them it meant nothing this left but one
chance-to catch the train but at the first
step he slipped and the lantern went out
when he pulled himself to his feet the last
car was already passing he took another
step and slipped again

  the train was now whirling along much
faster than he could run but it was not the
first time that he had made a flying leap to
the platform he took a quick step jumped
and clung on in desperation as his fingers
closed about the frozen rail

  pulling himself up he attacked the rear
door and found that the car was dead it
was no time for ceremony with his fist he
broke the glass made his way through the
front end of the car in the same way and
stopped the train

  when it backed into the siding at the sta-
tion just in time to get out of the way of a
double-header freight he closed the office
took his hat and departed for parts unknown

a bright headlight must be backed by watchful eyes brilliance needs
     intelligence behind it-biags of the big eagle eye
the engines leap

by merritt crawford

         was it a case of suicide or did the
         curve prove too much for  old kate

            any men on the e r and y
will recall the accident at
the curve just beyond the
station at vannette which
gave engines leap its
name yet i doubt if any
of them have ever heard the strange version
of it here made public for the first time or
its stranger sequel

  for many reasons it has seemed advisable
to conceal the true names of the places and
characters that have a part in the story al-
though doubtless certain old - timers will
have little difficulty in identifying them
for these all explanations will be superflu-
ous but for the benefit of those others who
are unfamiliar with the serpentine windings
of the e r and y i will say that vannette
is one of those unimportant little side-hill
stations clinging to the lower slopes of the
alleghanies that lie between eurenia the
head of the rockland division and mead-
owville its southern point seven miles be-
low vannette in the direction of meadow-
ville is the junction

  on the official map of the e r and y
in the train-despatchers office at eurenia
engines leap-the leap it is usually
called-is designated simply block sig-
nal no a rockland division because
at the northern extremity of the curve on
the very tip of the crescent and just out of
view from the station-agents window there
is a semaphore opposite the station itself
is a siding

  from the outer edge of the leap a
green slope stretches abruptly down to the
road that skirts the base of the hill sixty
feet below the slope is seamed and scarred
with deep ugly gashes now almost obliter-
ated by the rains and snows of a dozen sea-
sons although beneath the wild blackberry-
bushes that riot above the ivv-clad stone

	r r	

wall at the roadside may still be found frag-
ments of charred and rotting wood or rusted
iron the last evidences of the wreck which
gave the curve its name

  late one mid-august afternoon i was
leaving vannette after my annual visit to
a venerable maiden aunt and by some mis-
calculation i had reckoned the arrival of
the local which connected at the junction
with the night train for the city at exactly
one hour earlier than it was actually due
when i had obtained this interesting infor-
mation at the ticket-window and stepped
out oh the platform again i became aware
for the first time that the rickety old phae-
ton which had brought me was gone

  silas my aunts man had evidently felt
acquitted of all further obligation to me
when he had deposited my trunk upon the
baggage-truck in front of the station prob-
ably he was also of the opinion that unless
he hastened the tip i had given him would
turn into brass or dead leaves like the magic
money of the arabian nightsfor the phae-
ton was the center of a dust-cloud just then
rapidly disappearing down the road

  as i stood gazing irresolutely after it un-
certain whether to laugh or be vexed old
briggs as he was generally known on the
countryside - he had been station-agent
operator and baggageman at vannette for
twenty years-came out of his office

  whats the matter he inquired slip-
ping the check on my trunk as he observed
my look of annoyance in the direction of the
vanishing silas did you forget some-
thin

  i assured him that i had not and that i
was only annoyed at the defection of the
thirsty silas when i might have wished to
send him back for something he grinned
sympathetically and mechanically i of-
fered him the courtesies of my cigar-case
	the railroad mans magazine

    thanks he said as he selected a weed
ill smoke this after ive watered those
flowers if you dont mind i guess they
need a drink moren i do a smoke just now
-maybe as much as si does he added
dryly

   he pointed toward the grass plot back of
the station where a large bed of red gera-
niums and sweet alyssum bloomed with a
freshness and profusion that spoke well for
the care of their owner

   my acquaintance with old briggs had cov-
ered a period of several years owing to my
visits to the aforesaid aunt but it had sel-
dom gone beyond an exchange of ordinary
civilities and i had never observed him par-
ticularly now however i did so a man
who loves flowers is always worth cultiva-
ting and as old briggs circled the flower-
bed watering-pot in hand it was evident he
belonged in this category now and then he
placed it on the grass beside him while he
plucked a dead leaf or withered blossom
from one of the plants as tenderly and care-
fully as a mother would treat an ailing child

  you seem fond of your flowers mr
briggs i said by way of opening  and
they are certainly worth your care i dont
know when ive seen any that are lovelier or
better kept

  he raised his head with a quick glance
of appreciation it was a large head rather
too large for his spare little body and
thatched over with thin sandy hair shot
with gray but it was his eyes that com-
pelled my attention just ordinary brown
eyes the casual observer might have said-
only there was in them an indefinable some-
thing a strange mingling of sadness and ex-
pectancy as he leaned over the flowers with
back of all a haunted apprehensive look that
did not fit well with his years or occupa-
tion this i observed later was habitual

  as he looked toward me he emptied his
watering-pot

    are you fond of flowers   he asked

   i nodded

   theyre about the only company i
have he said slowly since my daughter
married and went up to eurenia to live
then he added as if in apology for a weak-
ness id get pretty lonely sometimes-if
it werent for them

   when he had finished his labors he came
and sat with me in the shade of the big elm
that grows by the station and we talked at
first our conversation was desultory for the
old man was shy and hesitated about voi-
cing his opinions when he was uncertain

how they were going to be received but
little by little he gained confidence and as
men who live much alone are wont to do
when the- have a sympathetic listener he
began to talk freely he had been with the
e r and y since boyhood and he told me
many interesting incidents-little fragments
and glimpses of railroad life observed from
his simple view-point during his forty years
experience

  by degrees our talk wandered from the
practical side of railroading to the unreal
the extraordinary the unaccountable that
happens in every railroad mans experience
old briggs recited many interesting remi-
niscences some of them had occurred with-
in his own knowledge but most had been
related to him by others he did not pre-
tend to vouch for these last although it was
apparent from the way he watched for their
effect on me that he more than half be-
lieved them

  he told of the odd and at times almost
human freaks and failings of engines of
air-brakes that set without the hand of the
engineer upon the lever - briggs had been
an engineer himself until his eyesight had
failed him of engines that refused to steam
even though the gage showed plenty of pres-
sure and of vicious vampire-engines that
had crushed the life out of their masters and
could always be depended on to do the un-
expected

   i listened to the old man as one listens to the
yarns of some venerable tar allowing always
the proverbial grainof salt yet so simple
and direct was his speech so obvious his be-
lief in much he was narrating that i for-
bore showing any incredulity i must con-
fess that during the telling i half believed
them myself and even now in the light of
later events i cannot afford to be too cynical

  from time to time as he talked old
briggs rose from where we sat and glanced
nervously up the track in the opposite direc-
tion from that in which the local was to
come it was evident that for all his volu-
bility his mind was on other things each
time he returned to his seat he resumed the
conversation only by the exercise of consider-
able mental effort he fidgeted constantly
and seemed uneasy and apprehensive one
might even have said expectant

   are you expecting a north-bound train
before the local   i inquired curiously on
the occasion of his last look up the track

  no-o he answered hesitatingly at
least-not exactly

  i beg pardon i returned but i 
the engines leap	

thought from the way you kept looking up
the track that you must be expecting some-
thing

  he made no reply instead he took out
his watch and made a brief mental calcula-
tion all the while shuffling nervously up and
down the platform as though debating some
question in his mind he pulled a long
spearlike blade of grass up by the roots and
chewed it savagely

  ive got to tell some one he said al-
most fiercely at last and more to himself
than to me

  then as if his mind had been suddenly
made up he came and stood in front of me

  excuse me mr ordway he said with
a directness that was yet diffidence but-
er-but do you believe in ghosts

  the question was so bizarre so sudden
that it startled me though i pride myself
on being phlegmatic but i admitted that i
had some doubts on the subject ghosts
toward the latter end of an ideal august
afternoon seem very far-away possibilities

  i dont mean ghosts of people he went
on ignoring my reply but ghosts of en-
gines-of engines that have been scrap-iron
for years maybe  

  i still confessed some doubts-at least my
face did for although i had said nothing
he continued exactly as if i had denied their
possibility

   i didnt believe such things myself-
once he said but im an old man now
and maybe an old man can see things that a
young one cant anyway you can soon see
for yourself itll be here in about eight-
een minutes he glanced at his watch
again

  i did not know what  it  was but i was
content to wait and see ghosts be they hu-
man or otherwise have few terrors for me
when the sun is shining yet i could not
help looking at old briggs curiously he
did not observe me for he was gazing
thoughtfully toward the curve beyond the
station

   yonders engines leap he said ab-
ruptly as though i had asked him the ques-
tion i felt relieved at the change of sub-
ject

  it was a runaway freight-engine that
jumped the track there wasnt it i in-
quired  i think i remember hearing about
it six or seven years ago when i first came
to vannette

  he nodded

   it was a suicide he said

  but i thought that only an engine and

two or three empties were smashed-that no
one was killed i corrected

  there wasnt he repeated but it was
a suicide all the same

  i checked the question on my lips for i
saw that the old man was not through

   i hadnt meant to tell anybody about it
he said gravely  most of the boys would
laugh at me if i did but as sure as i stand
here what im goin to tell you is true-
as true as the book

  he paused and after a moments hesita-
tion resumed his seat beside me

   did you ever hear of a man-an engi-
neer he queried whose engine was his
mistress who fussed over it and petted it
for all the world as if it was alive

  i shook my head in negation for i had
never heard anything of the kind it was
an idea entirely novel to me

  jack brodhead was one of that kind
went on old briggs  theres engineers
like him on most every division-until he
met my daughter nellie had the same en-
gine for twelve years- old kate he
called her although like the rest of course
she had a number-and jack had taken care
of her as  fireman and engineer from the
time she was brought from the shop

   he was forever foolin and tinkerin
about her even on his time off and many
a days pay he blew in buyin brass fittins
for her that werent included in the com-
panys supplies brass oil-cans brass lan-
terns brass waste-cups everythin brass-
inside her cab she wasnt anythin else as
far as the rules permitted-and all of it pol-
ished so you could see your face in it any
time

   jack had even got a couple of fine brass
flag-sockets to put op old kate when they
had an excursion or political jamboree to
take out though that wasnt often and a
pair of pretty silk flags to go with em too
he certainly did make a lot of that engine
maybe because she was his first and in fact
the only engine hed ever taken out reglar

  again and again jack and mckegney
the roundhouse boss almost came to blows
about replacing some part of old kate that
maybe showed only the least bit of wear and
tear but jack most always won out for
the super liked him and mckegney knew
that if an issue was made hed get the worst
of it so he had to give in even though it
did go against the grain

   even on his day off he used to go over
before the local went out-jack was reglar
on the local then same as he is now-to see


the railroad mans magazine

how old kate was though there wasnt an
extra but hated to take her out of the yard
for they all agreed that of all the cranky
unreliable engines on the division she was
the worst

    you dont know how to treat her
right jack would say to them  kates got
feelins just like any other lady and she
dont like being mauled by a lot of plugs
that dont appreciate her and after a while
most of the extras half agreed with him
old kate would climb a hill-and theres
plenty of them on the rockland division-
a goat couldnt eat grass off of if jack was
in the cab but let any other engineer take
her out and shed lay down on him at the
first chance

  naturally when jack began payin at-
tention to nellie he couldnt spend so much
time fussin around his engine he couldnt
be at eurenia and here too on his days off
and when a mans got a girl on the brain he
aint apt to waste much time thinkin about
an engine especially an engine that ought to
have been pullin freight for three or four
years

  fact is old kate would have been on
freight long before she finally was if it
hadnt been for the care jack took of her
but of course with other things to think
about-a home and fixins and nellie-he
let up a lot just about the time jack and
nellie were goin to be married the company
decided to put one of a new lot of engines
in old kates place-she took the local-the
train youre waitin for-from eurenia to
meadowville and back

    maybe you wont be so partikler about
your new engine brodhead said mckeg-
ney when he told jack of the coming change

 next one who gets that old crab of yours
wont be botherin us at the roundhouse so
much thats a sure thing

  jack laughed as he crawled out from
under old kate with his oil-can and a fist-
ful of waste in his hand

    im to be married next week mckeg-
ney he said  to the best little girl in the
world so i guess i can stand losin old
kate though if theyd taken her away from
me a year or so ago maybe id have cut up
some i used to think there wasnt another
engine like her on the e r and y

  jack started to climb in under her again
-backward you understand-to finish up
his job when mckegney yelled  jump
quick jack shes movin 

  jack jumped hed felt her most as
quick as mckegney had seen her drivers

move another second and shed have
crushed the life out of him

    by heavens mckegney he said as
he swung into the cab though old kate had
moved only about three feet  thats the first
time she ever tried that since ive been on
her but how did she get steam in her cylin-
ders the throttles over as hard as i can
jam it

  i dunno growled mckegney good
thing for you the big black divil aint tried
it before send her up to the roundhouse
when you get your new engine and well fix
her up for her new boss meanwhile youd
better watch yourself shes layin for you

   the day jack got his orders to take over
his new engine he seemed relieved nellie
and me were waitin here on the platform-
she always waited for him-when the local
pulled in without old kate she was in the
roundhouse bein overhauled by mckeg-
neys gang

   i asked jack how he liked his new en-
gine

fine he said then he leaned over
and whispered so that nellie couldnt hear

 im mighty glad to get rid of old kate
it may seem foolish but twice within the
last week i believe shes tried to get me
next time she might have better luck so
im glad shes gone where she cant do any
harm

   i laughed the idea of a big strong
chap like him havin such notions struck me
funny but i think differently now i
know things that i didnt know then and
besides-

   old briggs paused as though overcome by
some vivid recollection and nervously wiped
the perspiration from his forehead i made
no comment and he went on

  then jack told me what ive just told
you and how a second time shed have got
him if she hadnt been over an ash-pit he
didnt say what was the truth-that he was
afraid of her each time she moved only
about three feet-just enough to mash him
if hed been where she thought he was

   before i could ask him anything more
the conductor pulled the rope and with a
wave of his hand to nellie jack and the
local were off toward the junction i didnt
think much about what he had said-not
then later on i did though

   it was wednesday when he said this
and on saturday the weddin was to come off
on friday nellie came up to the station
as usual to meet him the night before old
kate had grunted through pullin a heavy
the engines leap



second-class freight she was due back with
a string of empties from the junction any
time before midnight that day

   i told nellie how sour she looked as she
went past wheezing like a horse with the
heaves  youd hardly know her i said

  nellie tossed her head

    old kates the only habit jack had
she says pertlike  and i guess he dont
mind losin her now that hes goin to get
me besides shed ought to have been pull-
in a freight these three years

   i didnt say anything girls are girls
and engines are engines and both are un-
certain in some ways but i couldnt help
thinkin just then of what jack had told
me it hadnt struck me before but i saw
it then that jack felt toward old kate some-
ways like a chap does toward a woman hes
thrown over it seemed to me i could even
see that cussed jealousy between woman and
woman showin in my own flesh and blood
when nellie spoke of that old has-been of an
engine

  maybe id have said somethin about it
but i was busy lightin up it was gettin
dark for it was along in the winter time
you know just then nellie looks up at the
clock

    jack must be late with  she says
anxious-like hed ought to be here now
and i havent heard him whistle yet at the
south-end crossin

  as she said it we heard him blow three
miles down the grade and we both went out-
side there was a trunk to go down on the
local and i put it on the truck there and
pushed it to the end of the platform sos it
would be opposite the baggage-car thats at
the back end of the train

  just as i got it down there nellie sings
out-i taught her the code when she was
knee-high to a mouse oh dad theyre
callin you from the junction 

   i ran back thinkin it was some special
orders for the local maybe but as i heard
it somehow i knew it meant hurrv

    vs-vs-vs  - thats vannette - it
was clicking  vs-vs-vs

   quick as i could get there i grabbed
the transmitter and answered it was jim
gaffney up at the junction sending

    hold  on siding-quick he rapped
over the wire engine running-wild-

   i didnt wait for any more i jumped for
the door nellie ahead of me as we ran out
on the platform again way down the track
toward the junction faintlike at first but
gettin louder every minute we heard the

umpty - tumty - tumty - tump umpty-tumty-
tumty-tump of the runaway its down-
grade you know all the way from the junc-
tion it came over me in a flash what we
were up against

  jack and the local must be still a mile
away-its a stiff two per cent rise from
south-end crossin here-and he never could
make the sidin before that wild engine
judgin from the way it was coinin reached
us there was only one thing to do if
we held the local on the block around the
curve by throwin the switch from the main
track into the sidin maybe i could ditch
the runaway it was the only chance

  nellie i says as-we ran down the
track toward the switch together-its a mid-
dlin long piece down the track there- run
back to the station - quick - and set the
block she understood and i heard her
gulp as i stumbled on in the darkness and
all the time that umpty-tumty-tumty-tump
umpty - tumty - tumty - tump gettin clearer
every second maybe twas imagination
but it seemed to me that it was right behind
me i could hardly breathe and my chest
seemed as if it was a solid chunk of lead

  just before i got to the switch - the
track was a glare of ice-i slipped and fell
-i could see the glint of the runaways
headlight on the rails as i went down i
must have hit my head or something for i
was out for a second i guess but i rolled
over out of the way and scrambled to my
feet again somehow

   then i fell again-i must have been
dizzy-with my hand almost on the switch-
lever but i couldnt reach it everything
happened so quick it was all mixed up i
heard the locals brakes screech as jack gave
her the air and her stack and the front of
her cab swung round the curve before he
could stop her and reverse shed overrun
her block fifty feet and how he had the
nerve to stick to her and not jump with that
other train cornin smash into her i dont
know i guess jack dont either

  then i heard nellie scream oh dad
-dad-its old kate its old kate  the
runaway roared over me-i wasnt two feet
from the rail-there was a ripping crash and
an explosion and i didnt know anything
more till i came to in the station with jack
and nellie hangin over me and all the lo-
cals passengers tryin to make out i was a
hero

  old briggs broke off for a moment and
again looked nervously up the track

  the experts said he went on after a


the railroad mans magazine

short interval that striking the curve at
such high speed old kate was bound to leave
the rails but i dont agree with em if
the local had been on time shed either have
been in front of the station or on her way
to the junction and nothing this side of a
miracle could have saved her perhaps twas
a miracle after all but i think it was a
plain case of suicide it looks to me as if
old kate killed herself out of disappoint-
ment because she missed the local

   there are certainly some things in the
story that seem to support your theory i
answered  and at least it is most interest-
ing but what has it all to do with ghosts
except that it is somewhat uncanny

   thats just it he replied if it wasnt
for that part id never have thought old
kate was a suicide-a real suicide she
walks - though maybe that aint exactly
the word to use about an engine-and thats
what made me think first she filled herself
its eight years almost since she took the
 leap and at first i didnt see her reglar
but now she comes through-just as she did
that late winter afternoon - always on a
friday-the day she did it

   i started for the day was friday

  at first she fooled me he went on ear-
nestly  and i used to set the block and run
for the switch even now she fools me some-
times sometimes i think its a warning-
a warning for me or jack though hes never
seen her

  i thought of what he had told me of his
run for the switch and his fall on the icy
track perhaps he had received some in-
jury not apparent

   but mr briggs i suggested  surely
after so many years it cant be a warning
and after all are you sure it isnt your fan-
cy you tell me you are much alone-

   listen  he interrupted raising his
hand  shes coming-now

  the harried apprehensive look in his eyes
deepened i listened intently but i could
hear nothing but the drowsy chant of a dis-
tant cicada and the plaintive chirping of a
family of crickets in the next field far
away a locomotive tooted shrilly and long

   thats the local at the south-end cross-
in he said significantly the other train
-gets here just before it

  still i could hear nothing old briggs
grew visibly more tense he pressed his
lean gnarled hands to his temples

  cant you hear her-yet he queried
look youll see her clearing the bend-

  i looked but i saw no more of old kate

than i had heard it was different with my
companion that he saw her clearly vivid-
ly was written in every shaking line of his
pallid face and staring eyes i was turning
away in pity when suddenly at the far end
of the platform i saw some fragments of
paper swirl and eddy through the air exact-
ly as if disturbed by the passage of a train
all along the platform line the dust rose and
fell a puff of wind swept over us yet
i saw nothing absolutely nothing nor did
i hear anything but the quick labored
breathing of the old man at my side he
clutched my arm convulsively

   thank heaven he said fervently
 hes passed 

  instinctively i looked toward the leap
around it slowly swung the engine of the
local and an instant later the train drew
up at the station

  brodhead clambered down from the cab
 whats the matter old man   he asked
kindly  you look as if youd had a touch
of the sun

  im all right jack said old briggs
shakily and without saying good-by to me
he turned and went down the platform to see
my trunk safely aboard

  when i came back to vannette the fol-
lowing year there was another and younger
man who received my trunk on the platform
wheres old briggs i asked him

  he did not quite understand

   why hes dead he answered bluntly

   dead   i echoed  when  how  
by this time the new agent had observed
that my trunk was checked from the city

   oh  he said shortly  i was won-
derin how you hadnt heard about it most
every one round here has the old man
died the night of the landslide at the
 leap last winter it was heart disease
or apoplexy - they say he hurt his head
eight or nine years ago an maybe an artery
burst-or something

   they found him lyin up by the switch
there-though why hed gone there nobody
could make out-but hed set the block all

here are some stories about a lively gang of railroaders who liked to play
tricks at weddings they were running on lines in the middle west back
in the early eighties when rules were not so strictly observed as in these
days be that as it may you will recognize in these yarns many happenings that
do occur in our times even if it is not good railroad business to run excursion
trains to hangings	

an episode in a monkey-cage a runaway train that played havoc with
a rubes wagon and an engineer who took his girl
in the cab and eloped with her

yalking about tricks played at
  weddings said jack i be-
  lieve that one of the funniest
  a well as one of the most
  unpleasant jokes for the vic-
  tim was played upon jake
  brown by the boys of the missouri pacific
  at sedalia missouri

  to give a thorough understanding of the
matter i must tell you about jim merrifield
and the causes that led up to the perpetration
of the trick everybody knew jim merrifield
he was running freight on the sedalia and
lexington branch the katy was a part of
the missouri pacific then and five divisions
centered at sedalia

   on the katy there was the division from
sedalia to hannibal and from sedalia to
parsons and on the missouri pacific from
sedalia to st louis sedalia to kansas city
and sedalia to lexington if there was
any devilment going on jim merrifield was
sure to have the credit of it though he may
have been at the other end of the division
whenthe affair occurred

   at that time there was a lively gang of
railroaders in sedalia and they used to make
things hum if the railroad interests had
been taken out of the town there would not
have been much left the sedalia bazoo
published by the  immortal  j west good-
win whose fad was running excursion trains
to hangings was at the height of its pros-

perity and ed burrowes was goodwins
chief cook and bottle-washer

   he was managing editor city editor and
hustler-in-chief he was known all over the
system and when he felt like going on a
whiz he would climb on a train and wind up
at galesburg illinois denison texas or
some other seaport

  it made no difference whether he had
any money ticket or pass he had right-of-
ay over all missouri pacific rails he was
in close touch with the railroaders and gener-
ally one of the leaders in any pranks that
they might cut up

  merrifield was given a passenger run
soon after the occurrence i am telling of
some five or six months later having a run
between sedalia and kansas city and he
was running there the last time i saw him
though after i left there and went to another
part of the system i heard that jim had been
elected to the board of railroad commission-
ers of missouri

  he had acquired the nickname of  tor-
nado jim because one of these festive
cyclones that we used to think belonged
exclusively to kansas had concluded there
was no fun in chasing grasshoppers and it
raised up crossed the missouri river and
when it had got a few miles east of kansas
city it swooped down to earth to see what
was doing

  jims train was pulling along with some




the railroad mans magazine

thirty loads and was possibly half-way
between sedalia and lexington when the
cyclone struck jim was seated in the look-
out of the way-car as it was a warm day
he was leafting out of the window with his
elbow on the deck when he saw the storm
coming

  now jim had never seen a cyclone but
when he saw that copper-colored cloud sweep-
ing across the landscape its tail twisting
and turning like an elephants trunk hunting
peanuts he did not need an expert to tell him
what it was so he crawled out through the
window and had just got out on the running-
board when there was something doing

  the playful zephyr picked up the big
mogul and stood it on its nose in a ditch
it scattered the box and flat cars promiscu-
ously over the right-of-way it lifted the
caboose over a barbed-wire fence and gently

it picked jim

op bodily and
dropped him in
a hedge

deposited it in a corn-field it picked jim
up bodily carried him some distance and
dropped him in an osage orange hedge

  jim was not hurt but he was pretty
thoroughly disrobed and his flesh was
peppered with thorns from the hedge

    now blessington had a sister-a bright
winsome girl brown had been rather de-
voted to her but none of the boys suspected
that there was anything doing until one
evening when jim came off his run he was
met by burrowes who told him that a mar-
riage license had been issued to jake brown
and grace blessington and he presumed they
were to be married that evening

    whether j ake feared to let the gang know
what he was doing dreading some of their
practical jokes or whether he had concluded
that his marriage was none of the gangs
business the fact remains that few of the
boys knew what was up

 j im had not forgotten the cyclone episode
and he passed the word among the boys that
there would be something doing

 an impromptu meeting was held at the
roundhouse and the best plan of playing a
joke on brown was discussed all the en-
gine crews and trainmen who were in town
were corralled and at midnight there was a
mob of them at the roundhouse

 the blessington home was not far from
the roundhouse and at three oclock the
lights were all out except one in the second-
story front room the roundhouse foreman
was in the play so he sent the caller with a
message to the house to call
jake to go east on second 

   the gang kept in the
background and as jake
opened the door clad only
in undershirt trousers and
slippers and signed the
book the gang made a rush
and captured him

  near the roundhouse
was an old monkey-cage
that had been left by some
circus into this they thrust
jake securing the door firmly with a switch-
padlock

when the whistle blew at seven oclock
in the morning a pacific express com-
panys wagon drove up to the roundhouse
and the driver asked the roundhouse fore-
man to sign the book receipting for one
monkey in a cage the foreman did so
without a smile and the cage containing
the unfortunate brown was lifted from the
wagon and carried into the roundhouse
told in the roundhouse



  here he was spied by all incoming and
outgoing crews they kept him there all
day every man that came in brought a
little bag of peanuts until there must have
been fully a peck in the cage this with
water was all brown had to eat that day

   every man went through the usual per-
formance of people before a monkey-cage
passing in peanuts and poking him up with
a stick for a while the language that
brown used was red-hot but he soon gave
it up and sat there sullen and silent chew-
ing the bitter cud of his anger the more he
would storm the more joy it was for the
gang all he could do was to-sit there and
plan how he could get even

   in the meantime the wives of the mem-
bers of the gang were calling at the blessing-
ton home congratulating the bride and
sympathizing with her on the cruel fate that
had sent her husband out on an extra run
the night of his weddijig but assuring her
that it would not have occurred had he let
them know that he was to be married and if
the roundhouse foreman had known this he
would have sent somebody else out

    blessington had to sit there and listen to
them but all he could do was to grit his
teeth and swear that he would get even he
did not dare to tell his sister of the trick that
had been played

   brown was released at night as he came
out of the roundhouse he was met by bles-
sington with the remainder of his clothes
together they planned that brown should
not show up at the house until the following
day about the time that he was to have come
in on  so that the bride should not know
of the trick that had been played

    their precautions were of no avail how-
ever the gang saw to it that the bride
should hear the full particulars and when
they finally showed up there was more
trouble at the blessington home

   blessington had fallen a victim to the
western fever and for some time had been
contemplating a change to the far west he
had been promised a train on the santa fe
extension in new mexico and had only been
waiting until his sister married when he
intended to resign from the missouri pacific
and with his mother depart for new mexico

   brown decided that he would go with
him so about a month or six weeks after
the wedding they called for their time got
their clearances and left for the west

  the gang was out in force and gave
them a royal send-off when they finally
got away any feeling of animosity was en-

tirely gone but the die was cast and though
brown was out of work and had a new wife
to provide for he was not uneasy he was a
good runner and he did not doubt that he
would soon get an engine

   the party passed a couple of days in
kansas city and the railroad boys there saw
that they had a good time while in the me-
tropolis of the kaw they stopped at topeka
where brown saw the master mechanic of the
santa fe and had no trouble in getting an en-
gine especially as he was willing and anx-
ious to go to the front so when they left
topeka on no  brown had a job as well
as blessington

  now the construction gangs were being
pushed for all that was in them there
was not much money available for the road
was new and as a result the roadbed had
to follow the ground pretty closely and
there were heavy grades and sharp curves
grades could be cut down and the curvature
reduced later on the tiling now was to get
the road through and trains running

   blessington was given a run out of las
vegas and brown was also assigned to the
same division so that it frequently hap-
pened blessington had brown to pull him
no regular passenger service had yet gone on
this division and passengers were carried in
the way-cars there was considerable local
freight to be handled and most of the ton-
nage was new material going to the frontier

  the road crossed the divide at glorietta
summit the western slope was pretty steep
with several stiff curves some of the engines
had air but at that time few freight-cars
had air-brakes it required the best efforts
of the three brakemen and the con with the
help of the air on the engine to hold em

   brown was pulling thirty loads bound
west and as he dropped over the summit
he shut her off and put on the air but the
brake was out of order and the air failed
to take hold

   he then squealed for brakes but the
shacks had set every brake on the train he
saw that he could not hold em and as the
train dropped over the hill the momentum
increased so rapidly that the engine was soon
rocking like a ship at sea

   a switch-cable and hook carried on the
pilot-beam was thrown into the air and
caught the hand-rail on one side of the
engine tearing it away as one would snap a
pipe-stem

   down they went at the rate of a mile a
minute brown realized that he had done
all that he could and that the only hope


the railroad mans magazine

the boys sworjs that he must
have cleared seventy-two feet-

lay in getting off that engine before she
turned over and pitched down the gorge

   brown got down on the tender-step
swung from the hand-rails for a moment
and then jumped the boys swore that he
must have cleared seventy-two feet actual
measurement in that jump-but as it was on
the side of a mountain and he jumped down-
hill there is nothing remarkable in that feat

  the fireman hesitated until it was too
late to jump he had to stay he opened
the sand-box valve but the pipes were
clogged he got out on the running-board

and poked away until the
obstruction was removed
and the sand running
freely

   material curve was
short and steep the
outside was elevated for
thirty miles an hour so
that when the engine
struck it going at the
rate of sixty it was prac-
tically the same as a flat
curve the engine rode
on the inner rail for
a moment it was touch
and go whether she would
overbalance or hang to
the rails f ortunately
she came down all right
and held the steel

  while all this was
happening the brakemen
were not having a picnic
being on top they got
the full benefit of the
swing and roll as the
trucks struck the low
joints and high centers

   they were compelled
to lie flat on the deck
and hang on to the run-
ning-boards with all the
grip of demons there
was nothing else to do
if the cars went into the
ditch they would have to
go with them all they
could do was to stick to
the running - boards and
trust to luck to get clear
when they went down

  as the train dropped
over the summit bless-
ington back in the ca-
boose knew there was
something doing fortu-
nately the only passengers he had were paw-
nee charlie and his wife he managed to
pull the pin and cut loose from the train
and then found that he could hold the way-
car under control with his brakes while his
train darted away down the mountain

  he saw brown as he dropped from the
engine and as the way-car whirled past the
spot he noticed that brown was still on his
feet and felt thankful that one man at least
was safe blessington managed to hold the
way-car under controi but he did not attempt
to stop on the hill that was impossible
told in the roundhouse



  with the usual stolidity of the indian
pawnee charlie and his wife felt no concern
it did not occur to them that the were
likely to find themselves in the happy hunting
grounds in short order

  for sixty miles that train plunged down
the slope and though little more than an
hour was occupied before it struck the three
miles of level track below cononcino it
seemed a lifetime to the crew

   the grip of the brakes which were still
set began to have an effect and before the
train had crossed the -three-mile level she
stopped

  ten gondola-cars next the engine were
laden with steel rails and track fastenings
the stuff was scattered along the right-of-
way just where it was not wanted

  when brown met blessington he told
him that he believed he would much prefer
playing monkey to attempting to hold thirty
loads down glorietta hill

  if all stories are true jake had his
troubles in the west running an engine
in the mountains with three-and-a-half per
cent grades and sixteen-degree curves was a
vastly different matter from running an en-
gine across a missouri prairie between se-
dalia and kansas city where anything over

one-and-a-quarter per cent grade was terri-
fying

  they say that it was some time before
brown would shut off in time on the summits
and let his engine drift-and he frequently
dropped down a hill working steam when he
ought to have had her drifting

  but jakie soon caught on at that time
the demand for men was so great that
experience in mountain-running was not
asked about and each newcomer had to
learn the road as best he could

   get over the division any old way but
get over was the rule it not infrequently
happened that men were sent out on an
engine who had never seen the road beyond
the outer switch-stands of the yard and
there was no time to give them a chance to
learn it but as the road was under con-
struction there was no necessity or demand
for fast time and there was no one to kick
if trains only ran within rifle-shot of the
time-card a man could manage to bang
along over the road even though he did not
know it

  now if there is one thing that will make
a general manager get up on his hind legs
paw the air and howl that is a succession
of engine failures it not infrequently hap-

 near the roundhouse was an old monkey-cage into this they thrust jake
g

the railroad mans magazine

pens that these are caused by a lack of funds
in the motive-power department or the neg-
lect of the purchasing agent to honor the
requisitions of the master mechanic for the
spares and supplies that should always be
carried in every storeroom

   one-half the engine failures are caused
by the neglect to have some little thing on
hand when needed the poor engine-runner
is called on the carpet for an engin failure
that would not have occurred if some store-
keeper or purchasing agent was not trying to
make a great showing for economy

   j ake was where he could not get sup-
plies and his engine would have only such
care as he should give her with the help of
the wipers

   he dropped over glorietta summit one
day with twenty-six loads behind him
about a third of the way down a road crossed
the track after running alongside for half a
mile and then continued to follow the track

down the mountain for a quarter of a mile
farther there was no excuse for the driver
of a team coming in either direction failing
to see an approaching train

  as he dropped over the hill he hooked
her up and shut her off working only steam
enough to run the air the brakies were all
on top his train was well under control
when a farm-wagon containing a man and
two women came up the hill toward the
train

   jake blew the usual whistle for the cross-
ing and did not dream that the fellow in the
wagon would not stop instead the man
drove deliberately onto the crossing there
was no time to swear at his stupidity jake
grabbed the reverse and threw her over gave
her both sand-pipes and opened the throttle

  with the-engine in the back motion he
hoped that he could check the train and
avoid hitting the wagon	-

   instead he blew out his left cylinder-
head he hit that wagon square in
the center the women who were
in the rear seat were dumped on
the right side of the track and
the driver on the left while the
wagon was thrown into a field he
knocked off the headlight and
jammed the stack back at an angle
of forty-five degrees and he did
not check his speed

  as jake swept by he leaned
out of the cab window cussing
the yokel sat where he had been
dumped on the bank with open
mouth staring at the train when
the way-car went by blessington
threw a piece of coal at him

   there was no stopping the
train now they had to keep
moving motion is money in rail-
roading and in this case motion
meant not only saving the lives
of the crew but avoiding a wreck
also so down the hill they swept
jake could only work one side
now and so long as they were
on a three-per-cent grade he had
to keep going

   they got the train in all
right but jake got ten days for
plugging his engine and blowing
out a cylinder-head the farmer
and his women and the team were
unhurt but of course there was
a danfcrge-suit and the company
had to pay though it was entirely
the fault of the farmer

the knot was soon tied

  in the summer of s said my pal
the old hogger  there was a young engineer
by the name of king on the katy pulling
passenger between sedalia and parsons he
was a handsome young fellow well set up
well-educatedand a gentleman

   he was quite a favorite in sedalia and
had a tenor voice which was fairly well
trained he formed the acquaintance of the
daughter of a wealthy business man and in
the course of time they fell in love

  the young couple were admirablysuited
and finally king managed to pluck up suffi-
cient courage to pop the question he was
accepted for a time all went smoothly
the young man was a frequent guest at the
young ladys home and so far as he could
see was not objectionable to the old gentle-
man in the course of human events it
became necessary for king to ask the old
gentlemans consent

  then there was trouble father told
king that while he had no objections to him
as a man he had other plans for his daugh-
ter he would not allow her to marry a
greasy engineer

   he ended by strictly forbidding the young
couple to see or speak to each other

  this was the worst thing the old man
could have done the daughter was a chip

off the old block and just as determined and
headstrong

   it was not long until the old man found
that the lovers were frequently in each oth-
ers company and he determined to send the
girl to an aunt in cincinnati

   both were well acquainted with a young
woman the society editor of the bazoo and
through her they established a means of
communication the fact that she was to be
sent to cincinnati was duly communicated
and a-plan was at once set on foot to cir-
cumvent it

  at that time katys no  pulled in
from hannibal shortly after  pm and
would meet the missouri pacifics no  from
kansas city to st louis no  following
no  as far as the roundhouse where 
changed engines for st louis and  for
parsons

   the plan was that the young lady should
have her pullman reserved on no  for st
louis and board the sleeper at the depot
where all her friends would bid her good-by

  the society editor of course was in the
crowd but claimed to be going as far as
jefferson city so when the train pulled
out the two girls went into the chair-car
the society editor having only a couple of
hours ride was not taking a berth


the railroad mans magazine

  when no  reached the roundhouse
there was none of the young ladys friends
on board so she quietly dropped off the
steps of the chair-car opposite the round-
house and hurried around to the katy tracks
to the south

   here she found kings engine standing
on the house-track waiting to back down
and couple on to no 

   he was watching and as the dark form
of the girl glided around the back of the
roundhouse and came up on the right side of
his engine he leaped to the ground and lift-
ed her into the gangway

   he told her to crouch down on the deck
close to the boiler-head where none of the
railroad men would notice her the fire-
man stood in the left gangway so that any
one glancing into the cab would not see the
crouching figure

   king did not draw a full breath until
his engine had coupled on and the con gave
him the light he pulled the - throttle and
as soon as the train was clear of the leads
and swinging into her stride for the run he
got down and assisted the girl to the fire-
mans seat

   he made her as comfortable as possible
for the long night-ride from sedalia to par-
sons the only danger was that the con
might come ahead and see the girl and king
did not want her to be seen by any of the
crew except the fireman

   but king did not know that the society
editor of the bazoo was on the train or that
she had miraculously received orders at the
last minute to go to parsons instead of jef-
ferson city

   she knew the conductor personally and
after he had worked his train he came back
and sat down beside her for a little chat she
informed him that her friend was on the en-
gine and that she was eloping with the en-
gineer king she said did not want any
one to see her so that if the old man used
his power with the railroad officials the crew
could plead innocence

  the con was in the play in a moment
and he arranged that when they stopped at
clinton the bazoo girl should go ahead to
the engine and tell king that wherever it
was necessary for orders to be handed him
he should turn the engine over to the fireman
and drop off as the engine passed the depot
so that the con would not have to go for-
ward

  at clinton the bazoo woman went ahead
as agreed and king felt easier

  at nevada the division superintendent

came ahead to the engine and talked a few
minutes with king whose heart was in his
throat lest the super should take it into his
head to ride on the engine

  just before they reached fort scott he
had the girl don a jumper and jammed a
cap down close over her short curly hair

   it seemed a whole year before they got
away from fort scott though they stopped
only six minutes from fort scott to par-
sons it was plain sailing

   as the sun rose over the prairie he
glanced across at his sweetheart to see how
she was holding up under the long hard ride
to one unaccustomed to the motion of an en-
gine but her eyes were bright her color
was good and there was no trace of fatigue
as she answered him with a smile

   just as he pulled into parsons he no-
ticed a hack drive up close to the left side of
the track he saw the bazoo baby drop
down from the front platform of the smoker
and run ahead by the time the train had
stopped she was even with the cab she told
him there would be a conveyance waiting for
him at the roundhouse that the driver had
instructions where to drive them and then
she dodged around the nose of the pilot and
was just in time to help her friend down
from the engine and into the waiting hack

  kings engine was cut off and he pulled
down and let in the other engine that was
to pull the train from parsons to south mc-
allister

   he had to stand on the siding until no
 pulled out and as he started to pull down
to the siding the editor of the sun who
had been let into the secret climbed into
the cab saying that he would ride to the
roundhouse

  now king wished that editor anywhere
else than in his cab just then but he felt that
it would not do to offend him as he
jumped down to look over his engine the
editor followed him and told him that he
had a cab waiting for him at the roundhouse
and that the girls had already driven to the
parsonage

   king grasped his hand and thanked him
warmly the two men climbed back into
the cab and no  having pulled out they
backed down to the roundhouse without
waiting to remove overalls and jumper king
the fireman and the newspaper man entered
the hack and were whirled away

  the knot was soon tied

   a quick drive to the depot a wire to
papa saying that his daughter was now mrs

  there was trouble and then more trouble
  and there was only one cause for it all

o  the salt lake limited
used to chase no  the fast
freight into salida as a ter-
rier chases a tomcat into the
kitchen if  was ten min-
utes late she had to pull
right into the yards but if she arrived sharp
ait  the road engines would cut off at the
coal-chutes pull up and back in on the house
track

  that gave the yard engine ten minutes
to pull the freight in to clear the main line
allowing five minutes for variations clearing
the line for  due at 

  now if you have never done one hun-
dred and twenty miles on an alkali division
in summer you will say its a small thing to
scrap about why dont you pull on up
into the yard 

  thats all very fine but just pulling up
isnt all the limited follows you in the
road forks here the limited has to be
cut and shifted into two sections-one for
leadville and the other over marshall pass
to salt lake for this thing happened when
what is now the main line ended at lead-
ville

  it was summer in salida johnny hill
and johnny carr came in on -double-
heading they were on time the  and
the  respectively were the grants han-
dled by these energetic space-eaters hill was
ahead and when the  was opposite the
switch he hooked her over the head brake-
man pulled the pin behind the second en-
gine

  all this time killeen the yardmaster
was giving frantic signals for the double-
header to hoist the train up into the yard
hill didnt appear to see these signals when
the yardmaster saw that the brakeman was
cutting off he jumped on the foot-board and

l

told the driver of the  that was the
goat to back up

  just as hill and carr got their engines
into the forward motion the goat jumped on-
to the frog and blocked the switch

  the yardmaster - whose word is law in
the yard limits-ordered them to back up
couple on and pull the train hill asked
him where the yardmen were killeen in-
timated that that was his business

   bet four dollars theyre over at mc-
guires gin-mill

  thats their business-back up

  have they any other business hill
asked

  killeen knew that old tom andrews was
on no  and as he looked at his big watch
she blew the rear brakeman had gone back
and a second later they heard tom answer
his signal

  now will you back up you still have
two minutes to save your job

  all three of the engines were blowing off
hill beckoned killeen up under the cab win-
dow and told him to ask carr as killeen
went back hills fireman dropped off and
picked up the pilot-bar of the  as he did
so hill pushed forward and before the yard
engineer knew what had happened they were
all coupled up

  hill whistled carr ahead and then began
a tug of war that resembled a fight between
bulls

  if the goat had been on her guard she
could have backed them up but they got
her going all three were wide open spit-
ting fire and grinding sand the air was
blue with smoke and full of a smell like
brimstone

  the goat screamed down brakes but the
two grants eager to get to the turntable to
turn and head for home would not down


the railroad mans magazine

  at the water-tank where the rail was wet
both the grants blew up and before they
could get sand to them the yard engine
started them back

  the racket created by the three engines
brought carl ridgway chief clerk in the
office of his father the superintendent bare-
headed to see what was happening

  jones the master mechanic rushed from
his office and de remer the foreman from
the roundhouse

- the yardmaster and the head brakeman
on the freight were scrapping for the posses-
sion of the switch there was such a rain
of fire from the three stacks that nobody
seemed to care to rush in and pry them
apart

  without taking time to hear the case the
motive-power officials were inclined to sym-
pathize with the road engineers while young
ridgway leaned toward the yard crew

  while they scrapped old tom back on
 swore audibly while traveling men
who knew the road left the train and hur-
ried up to the hotel to supper

  it was smooth sledding for the goat until
she struck the wet rail by this time the
road engines were on dry sand one more
run and they shot the goat over to switch
the brakeman and the yardmaster were still
struggling for the switch when carrs fire-
man threw it over and the two grants backed
into clear

  when the officials had succeeded in pull-
ing killeen from the brakeman the goat
backed down coupled on and took the
freight in off the main line no  pulled up
to the station fifteen minutes late

  hill and carr were in bad

a life on the ocean wave

 i r she ship that i was on-against
my wishes-was the molly o
ml i malone a brigantine of some
jg i	two hundred tons burden i

vtirda- learned in the most startling
manner that she was bound
from san francisco to a port in china
where she would load coolies and then
sail for a port in the south sea islands
where the coolies would be sold to a wealthy
planter who had planned this particular
expedition because he was looking for cheap
labor

  when i awoke in the morning a big swede
who i afterward learned was the second
mate of the ship told me to go to the focsle
and get some grub

  there were six other men in there-all big
husky fellows save one this particular one
was a weak and puny lad he could not


the railroad mans magazine

meat and potatoes cooked together a large
white pitcher was filled with water

  this mess was placed in the center of the
table and each man dipped into it at pleas-
ure hands forks and spoons were used
with equal facility

  hunger had hold of me and it all tasted
good i must admit that i ate with a relish
that must have puzzled my companions of the
deep but i noticed that the weak lads plate
was empty and that his sobbing was pitiful
to hear

   youre not much like your pal there
said one of the men addressing me and
pointing to the youngster

   cheer up there sonny  yelled one of
the men we aint goin to hurt ye

  but the poor fellow only cried all the
harder he actually wept as if his heart
was breaking-and it was only once during
his sobbing i heard him speak then he
said

   i want-to-go-home  -

  then it dawned on me that like myself
he had been kidnaped

  the sailors jeered him roundly but i said
nothing in my heart i felt sorry for him

  i could understand how they could steal a
big husky fellow like myself but why they
should want a poor little waif like him was
beyond me

  one by one the sailors finished their break-
fast and filed out we two were left alone

  i went over to the poor fellow and tried
to comfort him he told me that he had been
walking along the water-front of san fran-
cisco with his father looking at the shipping
when in some way or other he and his
father had become separated

  he suddenly felt a hand clapped over his
mouth and before he was aware three men
had bundled him into a hack which was
rapidly driven away

  one of the men pulled a revolver and
ordered him to keep quiet he began to
cry he told me and fearing that he would
make a noise and thwart their plans they
put a gag in his mouth

  the next thing he knew he was in the hold
of the ship he had not eaten anything
since he was taken aboard his condition
was pitiful when he finished his story he
began crying again and he moaned and
cried until his poor little frame shook with
grief

  i tried to comfort him by telling him that
the men would not hurt him and that we
two would stick together whether or not he
believed that i like himself was a sniv-

eler the sailors term for the shanghaied
man i do not know

  he did not seem to trust me somehow
or other and just as i was about to convince
him further-for i wanted him to know that
i was his friend-the big swede stuck his
head in the focsle door and swore at us

   get out o here and get to work  he
yelled

  i left the boy and went out on deck i
found there two big stones that looked very
much like hard pieces of sandstone and
shaped about the size of an ordinary cobble

  they were placed beside two buckets of
water

   get down and scrub said the swede
pointing to one of them

  i dropped on my hands and knees and he
did also but only for the purpose of showing
me

  he sprinkled a little water on the deck
and then taking the stone in both hands
proceeded to rub it over the wet place until it
shone with cleanliness

  this interesting pastime is called holy-
stoning and when it is kept up for several
hours under a blistering sun one wishes that
he were on a torture-rack

  the swede stood over me for several min-
utes to see how i progressed harder
harder he yelled prodding me in the ribs
with his boot

  i bent over it with a will i could feel the
sun on my back but keener still i could
feel the piercing eyes of that giant swede
finally he was satisfied that i was doing
my best and he turned from me saying

  you do the port side

  it was evident that the other bucket and
the other  holystone  were for the unfortu-
nate youngster who was still crying his eyes
out in the focsle the swede mate looked
around and perceiving that he was not on
deck-that he had failed to obey orders-he
went forward to get him

  continuing my holystoning i turned so
that i could see what would happen i saw
the big mate go to the focsle door he
cursed and called evidently the youngster
did not reply for the mate darted into the
focsle and the next thing that i saw my
kidnaped companion was being hurled to the
deck by a force other than his own will he
sprawled along for ten feet

  he managed to find his feet he stood
there in the shade of the foreshrouds the
most wobegone object in all the world

  go aft shouted the mate and go to
work 
the man who wasnt game



  he made no reply he could not again
the mate ordered him to the holystone poor
lad i do believe that he made one feeble
attempt to obey but it was too feeble his
tears were blinding him

  that human brute rolled up his sleeve
drew back and with a force that would have
felled an ox struck the boy square in the
jaw he went down in a heap

  he lay very quiet-his face red from cry-
ing his poor weak hands clutched in what
might have been the feeblest effort to defend
himself i stopped and looked up

   go on or ill give you the same  yelled
the swede looking at me and accompany-
ing his words with oaths

  i bent to my work i didnt care to go up
against that fist-not yet

  he kicked the boy lying on the deck he
swore at him and cursed him he turned
him over on his back with the rough boots
of him and the lads face looked motion-
less at the burning sun

  he picked him up as easily and as roughly
as one would handle the carcass of a beef
and stood him on his feet

  but tht boy could not stand he fell
motionless forward i surmised by the pe-
culiar listless manner in which his hands
hung by his side that he was dead

  and i was right

chapter vii

i take the aggressive

cor a second the swede stood looking at
the body of the boy whom a kindly
death had saved from the worst torture a
man can know-a life on a slave-ship then
he ran aft and down the companionway to
the captains cabin

  in a few moments he returned the cap-
tain followed i kept on with my scrubbing
and cold chills ran along my spine my brow
was covered with sweat

  the captain looked at the body a moment
leaned over it and put his hand on the spot
under which the heart once beat

  he was convinced without further par-
ley that his mate was a murderer and or-
dered the body consigned to the deep

   lend a hand here  yelled the mate

  at first i did not know that he referred
to me but he stared at me and repeated
his orders then he called to the man at
the wheel

  we were going before a calm wind and
so the helmsman had only to lash the wheel

with a piece of line kept on deck for that
purpose and come forward

  i left my holystone and stood beside the
corpse awaiting further orders the mur-
derous mate went to the focsle-deck and
returned with three long marlinespikes and
some rope

  lash him to these he ordered as he
threw them to the deck

  the sailor and i bent over he knew what
to do-i didnt but i blindly followed him
and in a few moments we had tied the mar-
linespikes to the dead boys legs

  now heave him over ordered the
mate

  the sailor took him by the feet and i put
my hands under his head my heart was
going like a trip-hammer i wanted to show
him some human respect-i wanted to be as
gentle as possible but the mates hurry
there  indicated that the molly o malone
was no boat for sentiment when it came to
burying her dead

  we lifted the body to the taffrail and
tipped it into the sea the heavy spikes car-
ried it from sight

  the helmsman returned to his wheel the
swede returned to his brutality i returned
to my holystoning and-i must confess-
a few of my tears mingled with the water and
the stone to make the deck more white

  we sailed on the hot sun still beating
down on my aching back but the deck was
getting whiter and whiter as i plied my mus-
cles to the stone it was a digression any-
how and while i was toiling i thought of
that poor lad sinking to his grave in the
deep of his parents of the awful murderous
mate that might end my life in the same
manner if i thwarted him

  and while these thoughts ran through my
mind i resolved that the death of that boy
would be revenged in some way or other

  i was born with a sort of fighting mania
it is a mania that is kindled whenever i see
any one getting the worst of it it is the
feeling for the underdog

  many of us have it whatever it is born
of i do not know but it is certain to rankle
in the breast of the man who has the blood
of sympathy in his veins i believe such men
are really human

  the more i thought the more i wanted to
get at that swede and i believe that if he
had crossed my path at a certain moment
that day i would have picked up the first
thing handy and let him feel my wrath

  but as the moments wore away i looked
at the situation more coolly i would have


the railroad man s magazine

my revenge but it should come at a time
when i would not get the worst of the battle

chapter viii
i try to make good

vjlte sailed on and on with the monotonous
precision of day unto day the good
ship behaved herself well the weather held
fair the wind remained steady but not
strong and the men including myself were
now in the regular routine of their work

  the swede mate said nothing to me for i
did my work-always the dirtiest about the
ship-without a qualm

  perhaps he felt that i had learned a good
lesson from the unfortunate lad and-well
perhaps i had

  there was one thing-he could not kill me
with work i was equal to any task he or-
dered done

  work never had horrors for me because i
always looked on the bright side of it and
went at it with a sense of pleasure on the
other hand nature had blessed me with one
of those bodies that can stand any kind of
wear and tear

  i began to know the sailors and found
them all friendly i was finally assigned
regularly to the second mates watch which
comprised four others besides myself

  one was a tall thin man from san jose
california whom we called charlie an-
other was an italian who had deserted from
a war-ship of his country and who was
known as tony and the other two were long-
mustached abs of the captain kidd type
that i used to read about in story-books

  our lives however were anything but
story-book lives if there was any glamour
or romance on that lime-juicer it must have
been in pickle none ever told a story none
ever sang a song none ever related daring
escapades with pirates on the high seas

  we were just an ordinary hard-working
crowd with a sort of kindly bearing toward
one another we had but little to say as i
have indicated but we never spoke of two
things in particular

  one was the death of our unknown com-
panion the other was the destination of the
molly o malone

  just why this second query seemed unan-
swerable i do not know none of the crew
aside from me seemed to care i was on
the alert however but every man i asked
set the answer aside as if it were of little
or no importance

  one night while i was seated on a coil of
rope on top of the forward hatch i received
an unusual shock

  the swede mate approached me and real-
ly spoke to me in a pleasant manner

  i had been given to understand that it was
far from ship etiquette for a mate to speak
in friendly fashion to any of his men but
this man-whom i hated from his head to
his feet without reserve and in a manner that
left no opening for anything but hatred-
had actually come up to me and was speak-
ing to me in a kindly tone of voice

  well how do you like it he asked
drawing a long whiff of smoke from his
pipe

   im getting used to it i replied  i
find the work pretty hard but-

  have you ever been to sea before he
asked twisting the words to suit his foreign
method of expression

  no i replied

   youd make a pretty good sailor do
you like the sea

  then i replied

  i have not been to sea long enough but
there is something about the life that ap-
peals to me i think that i might like it if
i were on a different sort of ship

  i had hopes that this might anger him i
wouldnt have cared if he had landed on me
then just as he had landed on the unfortu-
nate boy i was ready for him

  but instead he only smiled his great
hams of fists hung listlessly at his side i
dropped my eyes for a moment to take them
in

  what a chance for a heavy-weight pugilist
thought i six feet tall and over shoulders
like the back of a cab arms that hung al-
most to his knees and those mighty hands
added to these fighting qualities he had the
thin hips of the ancient warrior and an in-
telligence which would have stood him in
good stead

  he only smiled

  this is a good ship he said we are
on a splendid journey the men will have
the very best of treatment if they will only
do as i say

  what do we get paid i asked

  that depends on what we do after we
leave china

  are we bound for china was my next
question

  yes he replied we go there for chi-
nese laborers theres big money in it we
kidnap em then we take them down to the
south sea islands or to south america
the man who

wasnt game



where we sell them to the planters who want
good labor for little money

  now ive been watching you boy he
went on speaking more kindly than i be-
lieved he could speak  and youre the kind
that knows how to work besides you are
not the ordinary sailor youve had educa-
tion i can tell that by the way you mind
your business

  to be sure he was trying to lure me into
his vile business of slave-trading

  my first impulse was to reach for the near-
est spike and let him have it full on the head
-but that would have been foolish

  he would have had the best of me for
even if i had felled him he would have
called the other men to his assistance and i
would have been put in irons or shot-and
i did not want either 

   i will play with this gay lad said i to
myself  tis a long journey that i have
before me and when the hospitable coast of
china looms up on the bow then he and i
will have our little say meantime i will
be diplomatic and i will even become a
slave-trader if it will please him

  the days wore on and the ever-varying
life of the sea charmed me

  i began to like it there was something
spirited in the life there was the risk and
the danger which i liked and when we sped
before the wind or reefed sail in a squall i
loved the sensation it was so real-so ex-
hilarating 

  the swede and i became good friends-
at least so he thought i had promised to
give him my answer about joining his slave-
trading gang when we reached china

  he never pressed me to decide against my
will but he continually persuaded me to
do so

  not once on the long journey did he ever
refer to the young man whom he had killed
not once did he even hint that the boy had
been aboard one night i made up my mind
that i would speak to him about it but on
debating it in my mind i decided that i had
better wait

  as we approached the orient uncertain
winds carried us toward the south and one
morning just after dawn the man at the
bow sang out  land ho 

  he was pointing over the starboard bow
and there in the dim haze we could outline
a mountainous land

  it was the first time that i had ever seen
land from the sea-and it was a strange sen-
sation at first i thought that it was a cloud
hanging low on the horizon and my childish

and repeated where where where
must have startled the other sailors to laugh-
ter

  as the day wore on it loomed larger and
larger ahead of us we were making straight
for it and once i noticed the captain come
on deck and  shpot the sun only to nod to
the mate that all was evidently well and
to keep her head into the wind

  i had learned to steer and took my place
at the wheel whenever my turn came just
the same as any of the able-bodied seamen

  it came between six and eight bells that
night and as the moon shone bright and
clear the captain decided to keep before the
wind until we got too close to the land
ahead when we would take a tack offshore
of this i was not sure but i imagined from
the little sea knowledge that i had gained
that this would be his idea

  the wind freshened toward ten oclock
and the moon kept its vigil in a clear sky
the bell had just struck six times when i
jumped from my bunk in the focsle where
i had been reading and clad only in over-
alls and shirt walked aft to relieve the man
who was then steering

  he stood aside to give me the spokes and
said as he didso keep her full

  this was his last order and of course it
had to be passed on to me

  i nodded took the wheel looked up at the
topsails which were bulging with the wind
and knew that i was on my course

  the land was now very close perhaps only
eight miles away but it presented a grand
and majestic sight in the moonlight it
seemed that the mighty mountains rising out
of the sea were ready to topple over ci us

  there was not a light visible-not even a
beacon of the sea-and it seemed as if we
were approaching some strange coast some
fairy-land not recorded on the maps but
which had come out of the sea like a mighty
titan to greet us

  as we drew nearer i noticed a series of
small twinkling lights near the horizon
they looked like the lights of a small vil-
lage and with malice aforethought i
brought the molly o malone around so that
she was heading straight in their direction

  i bared my breast to the cooling breeze
from the shore which now reached us i no-
tired that it was redolent with the odor of
spices and strange woods that carried the
tang of encouragement into my veins height-
ening the plan that was rapidly forming in
my mind

  the swede came out of the focsle


the railroad mans magazine

looked at the stars then at the land ahead
and came aft

  the instant that he caught sight of the
lights on shore he yelled to me

  port hard a port 

  i brought her around as quickly as pos-
sible

   keep her off he said  why didnt
you let me know that we were so close keep
her off 

  i did not reply and he went below when
he was out of sight i let her come back to
starboard so slowly-oh so slowly-that he
did not notice it i estimated that we must
have been about five miles offshore and my
plan was to keep her about that distance un-
til i could carry out my program

  the wind was dying and the wrater was
calm save for the lapping of the waves
against the vessels prow i could not hear a
sound

  we were hardly making five knots an hour
when the wind died altogether the sails
were soon flapping idly and then came that
monotonous noise of the lime - juicer the
bumping of the staysail block on the deck
as the sail tried to pick up each vagrant gust

  this noise brought the swede mate to the
deck again it told him that  was not just
right he looked about for a second and
then came aft to the wheel where i was
standing

  didnt i tell you to keep er off he
yelled

  i simply nodded my head

   then why didnt you- he uttered an
oath

   because i didnt want to i replied
without a gleam of excitement

  my moment had come

  now was the time for him to pay for kill-
ing that poor lad whom his men had shang-
haied

  i slipped the lashing on the wheel-spokes
and before he had time to realize what was
happening i fairly jumped at him with all
the fury of a tiger

  my hands were around him and i was
choking him i could hear the blood gur-
gling in his jugular vein and in the faint
light i could see his eyes bulging from his
head

  having made the attack i had the advan-
tage i got as close to his hot and sweating
body as possible because if i kept any dis-
tance from him he would have been able to
hit me

  ere he was aware of it i had forced him
against the house i bent him back until his

spine must have cracked and with my hands
still on his throat i thrust my knee into his
stomach

  now you dog i said im going to
make you pay for killing that boy 

  just to rub it in good i cursed with un-
wonted enthusiasm and heaped the con-
tumely of contempt on him in words that ex-
pressed my feelings beyond a doubt but he
was slowly getting the use of his hands
those giant members were gradually getting
a grasp on my body and it was time to act

  tightening my grip on his throat i lunged
him to one side tripped him and hurled
him against the taffrail

  before he could regain his feet i had
pulled a marlinespike from its socket he
made for me but i did not spare him

  the marlinespike crashed into his head
and he went down into the lee scuppers like
a fallen beef

  i thought that i had stunned him but he
was up and ready for a new attack and
perhaps the only thing that prevented me
from finishing him was the fact that he
yelled for help

  my plan was to beat him into uncon-
sciousness jump overboard and swim
ashore

  i was obliged to jump sooner than i ex-
pected however for the captain came up the
aft companionway and the first mate with
whom he had been playing cards in the cab-
in appeared at the forward way

  i saw a glimmering pistol in the hands of
each

  i knew that my life w-as not worth more
than the first shot that would be fired rush-
ing at the swede i landed a crashing blow
on his head for good measure i saw- him go
down again as i nimbly leaped the taffrail
and shot into the wrater

  i struck out for the shore looking over
my shoulder i saw the captain and the mate
start the foolish scheme of shooting into the
water i had only to surmise when they
might pull their triggers and then let my-
self sink when the bullet struck the wrater
its impetus was broken and its course de-
flected they couldnt possibly harm me

  once or twice i heard the bullets go ping
as they struck the water close to me but i
kept on-each stroke bringing me closer to
the shore

  i knew- that i had the swim of my life
ahead of me but my plan was to get out of
range of the bullets and then swim easily so
as not to exert myself

  finally the shooting stopped i turned in
the man who wasnt game



the water and could see that the molly o
malone was pointing her nose outward it
was evident that her skipper had decided to
take no risk in coming closer i surmised
that he might have hove-to until morning
so that he could get his bearings and make
port but she seemed to have caught a land
breeze and leaning over in the moonlight
and making headway she was a picture that
i shall never forget

  i struck out boldly for the shore but a
strong current seemed to be forcing me back
it was a powerful current too but i was
game once or twice i became somewhat
exhausted but for relief i would turn on
my back and float for a moment

  however i knew that this sort of thing
only retarded my progress and my rests
were not for long i kept on and on

  now and then i felt a peculiar numbness
in one of my legs now and then some of my
muscles seemed to be getting useless now
and then the shore and the lights seemed to
go farther than come nearer and the great
ocean that lined up in front of me seemed a
turbulent barrier which no human being
could cross

  but i kept on-slowly and mechanically
my mind was ever on my goal i kept say-
ing to myself you must make it you
must make it  and i smiled as i said it
and this seemed to give more strength and
more courage

  i can never write just what sort of feel-
ing possessed me when suddenly a stretch
of beach-white and sandy-appeared before
me it looked like the snowy beach of a
fairy-land now i could hear the water
lapping the shore now i put one foot down
to see if i could stand

  my foot touched a sandy bottom i
thanked my stars fate was indeed good to
me i waded in step by step and at length
i stood on the beach something reeled in
my brain the exhaustion was beginning to
tell i sank to the ground it was soft and
welcome wet as i was i fell asleep

chapter ix

the village in the distance

rthere i was-a modern robinson cru-
soe on his tiny isle when i awoke
the sun was just breaking through the east
in a radiance of opal glory its shafts flung
high to the heavens in golden majesty i
arose stiff and sore but thoroughly rested
and took in my situation

  i was on an island about a mile from the
mainland-if a small protuberance on a
coral reef could be called an island i could
see the white thatched houses nestling on the
shore and i could also see some natives clad
only in waist-cloths walking to and fro

  i was thirsty my mouth and tongue were
swelling for want of water my first in-
tention was to hunt for fresh water on my
island but a hasty survey told me that it
would be futile

  i was on the tiniest of atolls and the wa-
ter in the center was so brackish that it was
undrinkable

  putting my hands to my mouth i tried to
yell but tny voice was harsh and sluggish
and did not reach to the other shore i took
off my shirt and running close to the water
waved it

  i had not done this for more than a few
moments when i noticed a commotion on the
mainland several natives had come down
to the waters edge and were gesticulating
wildly others followed them soon the
beach was covered with them-and then a
canoe was put out from the heavy trees four
men jumped in and they were soon pad-
dling in my direction

  as they came nearer and nearer i could
see that they were very black one in par-
ticular wore his hair high in some fantastic
dress and was talking with more vehemence
than the others pointing at me all the while

  they came closer i did not like their
looks i turned and looked out to sea-
just why i do not know the molly o
malone was nowhere in sight

  i turned toward the land again the na-
tives were now close to the atoll and were
eying me curiously presently they beached
their canoe they approached me with some
hesitancy two of them i noticed carried
some kind of death-dealing clubs

  they walked toward me and i smiled and
tried to show that i was friendly and said
 good morning in english - which lan-
guage they evidently did not understand

  they jabbered in their lingo but i could
not understand them i pointed to my
mouth and made other pantomimic signals
for a drink of water

  they motioned to their canoe and i
jumped into it the four pushed it into
the water until it was well afloat and then
scrambled aboard and plied the paddles

  on the way to the mainland they kept up
a constant talking they seemed to be in
a wordy fight about something

  the shore was now black with natives
g	the railroad mans magazine

and they almost pushed one another into the
water as the canoe was beached and they al-
most crowded me to suffocation as i stepped
ashore i was very weak and i sat on the
ground

  i pointed to my swollen tongue and
parched mouth the leader of the quartet
yelled  y era te papo vera te papo with
such vehemence that several dozen natives
scrambled through the thick growth of trees
and returned with a variety of vessels filled
with clear cool water

  it was high time that i had it too the
fever was mounting to my temples and i
was beginning to choke

  i drank the water in great gulps it per-
meated my system and made me feel cool
and strong i sat there with that great
crowd around me seeming unable to get
sufficient of the water-now drinking now
bathing my head and face i threw it all
over my body-it was so fresh and cooling
-and some of the natives helped me out by
throwing it on me from the vessels they car-
ried

                              to be

    in a short while the leader of my rescu-
 ing-party approached me he was mutter-
 ing something and i could see that he was
 trying to make me understand he motioned
 to me to rise i did so and he indicated
 that i was to go with him

    he led the way into the village and i fol-
 lowed him-and behind me was a crowd of
 native men women and children all talk-
 ing and gesticulating about the strange vis-
 itor who had been cast upon their shore

    presently my guide stopped in front of a
 low house and bade me enter he entered
 alone with me i found myself in a clean
 room furnished with a table and a chair
 made of the stout branches of a tree covered
 with the hide of some animal on the floor
 was a mat and a pillow made of weeds
 there was only one window and that was
 very small and near the roof

   my friend or foe-i knew not which-
 after seeing me safely inside closed the door
 and left me alone

    i heard the bolt clang and i knew that i
 was locked in

pinkerton days on the
lake shore

by john h painie

some pioneer railroad work of the famous american detective which
resulted in putting behind the bars some clever criminals
who had long defied the police

general manager of the lake
shore railroad was sitting in
his office studying the report of
a division superintendent on
the latest of a series of disas-
trous wrecks which had oc-
curred in the neighborhood of chicago
that was forty years ago the general man-
ager was sorely troubled not only had the
wrecks cost the railroad thousands of dollars
in damages but the officials had been unable
to find any explanation for them

  it had been supposed that the accidents
were due to defects in the road-bed but their
frequency coupled with the fact that they
had all occurred on the same division point-
ed to train-wreckers

  guards had been stationed along the divi-
sion but those who were perpetrating the
outrages seemed to have an intimate knowl-
edge of their movements and the wrecks
went on as before the general manager
after going over the report of the last acci-
dent failed to gather any suggestion from it
as to the identity of the culprits and he sent
for the general counsel of the road

   cheesbrough he said when that offi-
cial entered his office im stumped ive
exhausted all my resources and im just as
far from knowing how these trains are
wrecked as i was at the beginning

   if i were you said mr cheesbrough
 i would call on a man whom we have used
in our office lately to run down some dam-
age claims for us hes bright resourceful
and i think could solve the case for you

  the general manager sent word to the
person thus recommended to come to his
office and the next morning he appeared


the railroad mans magazine

  he was rather commonplace in appear-
ance somewhat short with a round expres-
sionless face his manner was quiet in the
extreme the general manager told him
briefly of the wrecks and explained the cir-
cumstances attending them the other lis-
tened attentively and then putting on his
hat started to leave the office

  where are you going the general
manager asked

   im going to get your men replied the
visitor

    but we havent discussed the terms said
the general manager

  well if i catch those train-wreckers i
shall expect the lake shore railroad to pay
me five thousand dollars he replied  if
i dont catch them i dont want a cent

  three weeks after this interview the yard-
master of the chicago yards called on the
general manager

   i wish you would see the city authori-
ties sir and ask them to do away with a
grogshop thats been opened right on the
borders of the yards he said  its a dis-
reputable shanty and the men are getting
drunk there in droves

on the job

  the general manager made a note of the
location of the place and in a day or two
strolled through the yards to investigate he
found a rough board shanty standing in the
outskirts of the yards with its entrance sur-
rounded by a crowd of switchmen car-
couplers and other employees of the road
he was very indignant and threw open the
door of the shanty intending to order the
proprietor off the grounds behind the bar
however to his great surprise he saw the
man he had interviewed but three weeks be-
fore in a dirty apron with the sleeves of his
flannel shirt rolled up serving beer from a
row of kegs behind a rough plank bar

  speechless with amazement the general
manager gazed at him for a moment and
then finding his look returned with a blank
stare totally devoid of any sign of recogni-
tion he turned on his heel and left the place

  soon he was in receipt of more complaints
from subordinate officials of the road telling
of the demoralization wrought among their
men by  martins speak-easy as the shanty
came to be known the master mechanic
said that men who had never been known
to drink would now turn up at the round-
house intoxicated and the yardmaster at-
tributed three or four bad smashups among

the freight-trains to the evil influence of mar-
tins bar things went along in this way
for several weeks when one morning the
general manager received this telegram

    you owe me five thousand dollars your
  men are in jail in elkhart please send coun-
  sel to prosecute

  the general manager was so interested in
the case that he went with the counsel of the
road to elkhart the same day there they
found two switchmen who had been em-
ployed in the yards the bartender met them
at the station and told the story of how he
had run down the wreckers

setting the trap

  at the very outset everything pointed to
its being the work of employees of the road
i thought at first of taking a job on the
line and trying to pick up a clue in that
way but railroad men are always quick to
recognize a spotter and wouldnt be apt to
put confidence in a green hand anyhow

  bartenders on the other hand for some
reason or other seem to know everything
thats going on so i decided to open a saloon
i didnt have any luck at all the first week
or so and i was beginning to feel discour-
aged when finally one night one of the two
men i have in jail here came into the shanty
about seven oclock and asked if he might
leave a couple of spike-draws behind the bar
he said the tool-house was locked but that
hed put them away later in the night i
felt pretty sure then that i had one of my
men

   i had an assistant in the shanty who
was dressed up to represent a dirt saloon
loafer as soon as the switchman who had
brought in the spike-draws left i told this
man to get ready and together we waited
for the switchman to come back he turned
up about  oclock and asked for the spike-
draws i gave them to him and he left the
shanty my man johnson was lying on his
stomach alongside the shanty on the watch

on the trail

   as soon as the switchman came out he fol-
lowed him i stopped just long enough to take
off my apron and then hurried after them
i could see johnson dodging along the rail-
road tracks beside freight-cars through the
yard and i followed him until we came to
the outskirts of the yard where the tracks
began to come together
pinkerton days on the lake shore



he quarreled with the conductor over paving his fare

   johnson stopped and i
came up with him he
pointed through the darkness
ahead without speaking and
i could make out dimly the
figure of another man talk-
ing to the switchman the
two lighted a lantern and
then started ahead up the
tracks the lantern made it
easy for us to follow them
so we let the men get some
distance ahead in order to
avoid any danger of alarm-
ing them

  we must have trudged
four miles out along the main
line when the lantern in front
stopped we were far behind
but we didnt dare come up
with them at that point the
road being open and no means
of concealment offered we
waited to see what would
happen and after a few
minutes the lantern began to
come toward us suddenly as
we watched it disappeared

we decided to go ahead and
had walked about five min-
utes when we heard a freight-
train coming over the tracks
on which we were walking

  we were on a trestle over a short culvert
and to save ourselves from being run over
jumped down into it we lit on top of those
switchmen and for about ten minutes there
was the liveliest fight you ever heard of we
had the advantage of being uppermost how-
ever and after a time managed to get hand-
cuffs on them then all of a sudden it
dawned on me what had happened

the capture

  we found their lantern and lighted it
and i sent johnson tearing up the tracks to
stop any train that might be coming down
he held up the mail train from cleveland
and i came along later with the two prison-
ers about  feet from where he stopped
the train we found a section of track taken
out on the way back the two men con-
fessed to us that they and two others whom
we will get to-morrow had caused all the
wrecks

  the proprietor of  martins speak-easy 
was allan pinkerton and his capture of the
train wreckers marked the beginning of his

connection with the lake shore road a con-
nection which lasted off and on throughout
his lifetime whenever anything came up in
the course of the administration of the road
which needed investigation the general man-
ager would call on him and he came finally
to have an annual contract with the com-
pany under a sort of roving commission to
find out anything he could that it was desir-
able the general manager should know it
was not so easy as it looked

  one of his most useful fields was in run-
ning down dishonest conductors who with the
elementary ticket system then in force were
often a real menace to the prosperity of the
road whenever he had nothing else to do
he would drop into the general managers of-
fice and say

    i guess ill take a run over the line for a
day or two you may get some messages
from me

  sure enough they would begin to come in
within a few hours

whistle at crossings and so on until he re-
turned to chicago

tricking the general manager

  these excursions were veritable pleasure
trips to pinkerton and he once told the gen-
eral manager that the reason he liked them
was because they gave him an opportunity to
practise his disguises the general manager
had read eugene sue and the great  lecocq 
stories but like most americans he was skep-

didnt recognize him until pinkerton
introduced himself

tical of tales of that sort it was this skepti-
cism which led him to bet pinkerton a dinner
one day that he could not disguise himself so
that he wouldnt know him

  two or three days after this conversation
a countryman in high rawhide boots with his
trousers tucked into the tops wearing a wide
brimmed felt hat and a red bandanna hand-
kerchief around his neck sat down in the
seat beside the general manager as the latter
was coming to town from his country home in
the suburbs of chicago the countrymans
maimer was most offensive he quarreled
with the conductor over paying his fare and
crowded the general manager so that he re-
monstrated with him the train had reached

chicago and the general manager was walk-
ing down the platform when the country-
man seized him by the arm

    if you dont mind ill call for that din-
ner after ive changed my clothes he said

   the surprising thing about it was that pin-
kertons only disguise consisted in his rough
clothes and in the accent he had assumed-to
change his voice he also had long straight
hair which with practise he had learned to
arrange so as to completely change the expres-
sion of his face he never used false beards
or articles of that kind after his experience
on the train the general manager met him
many times when he didnt recognize him un-
til pinkerton introduced himself

scenting a clue

  the general manager had many long talks
with pinkerton in the course of their ac-
quaintance in which the great detective told
him of his methods of solving cases on which
he was employed

    my first rule he said  is to determine
what person has the greatest motive for com-
mitting the crime having decided on that it
is generally a very simple matter to gather suf-
ficient evidence to convict the offender

   in illustration of this pinkerton told of a
bank robbery in a small town near chicago
which he solved months after the police had
abandoned the case

   i never pay much attention to a case of
that sort while the excitement over the dis-
covery of the crime is at its height he said

    it is much better to wait until the police
have let it drop then the criminals begin to
feel safe and relax their precautions

    in the case in point the cashier of a small
bank in springfield illinoisopened the bank
vault one morning to find that it had been
robbed during the night of every cent it con-
tained the locks had not been tampered with
and there was absolutely nothing to explain
how the thieves had entered the place the
police arrested the cashier as he and the presi-
dent were the only persons who had the com-
bination of the vault his innocence was
clearly established however and the case
was at a standstill when i was called in

first impressions

   i spent weeks in springfield getting ac-
quainted with the people in the town without
letting who i was become known my favor-
ite plan was to pose as a life-insurance agent
as that gave me an excuse for asking questions
pinkerton days on the lake shore



  about those in the place without arousing sus-
  picion there is a good deal of intuition in
  ray work and it was that as much as any-
  thing else that led me to look up the record
  of a grocer who had a small shop diagonally
  across from the bank

     i learned that he was regarded by his
 neighbors as a shiftless sort and some of the
 wholesale merchants with whom he dealt in
 chicago said he was very poor pay i scraped
 up an acquaintance with him and found he
 had advertised his business for sale there
 was nothing very suggestive about all this
 and yet whenever i pondered on the case
 that grocer would bob up in my mind i
 didnt like his looks in general and he didnt
 have the air of agrocer furthermore i soon
 learned that he knew very little about the
 details of the grocery business

     i had made friends with the wife of a
 man who kept a notion store next to the
 grocery and i played on her jealousy by
 praising in an off-hand way the appearance
 of the grocers wife

aided by a woman

      well my gossip snapped out  all ive
  got to say is she doesnt meet my notions of
  an honest woman none of the rest of us
  round here have money enough to go to chi-
  cago every week and she doesnt wear the
  same clothes she does at home when she goes
  either you wouldnt know her as she goes
  traipsin off to the station

     this was news to me for i thought i had
 studied the family pretty closely it only
 goes to show that women are keener observers
 than men when it comes to the little things
 the next time i came near the grocery store
 i was dressed in a way which i knew would
 disguise me and i shadowed the house until
 early one morning i saw mrs grocer leave
 for the station she was stylishly gowned
 and as the wife of the other storekeeper had
 t said you would hardly have recognized her

  i	followed her and we took the train for chi-
  cago together she went straight to a bank
  on leaving the station there and deposited a
  large sum of money

     in the course of the day she visited four
 banks and made deposits in each one i let
 her go back to springfield without molesting
 her but i knew the minute i saw her enter
 the first bank that i was on the right track
 when she returned to springfield two of
 my men went with her and my orders were
 that they should watch the couple day and
 night and arrest them if they started to leave

town together unless i gave them orders to
the contrary

    i then had another agent visit the grocer
in springfield and represent himself as a
purchaser of his store my object was to get
the suspect and his wife out of springfield
for a day so that i could have a clear field
to go through their store my agent arranged
with the man and his wife to meet him in
chicago the next day to sign the necessary
deeds for the transfer of the property

closing in

    as soon as my other men notified me that
the coast was clear i broke into the store by
a rear window and began my search every-
thing in the place convinced me that the store
was merely a blind to cover the mans real
aims the stock was small and evidently
had been selected by a person who knew
nothing about the business i spent four
hours in going over the store and living-
rooms however without discovering the
smallest thing to bear out my suspicions

    finally i went out into the back-vard a
small plot of ground surrounded on three
sides by a high board-fence there was noth-
ing there to excite remark and i had turned
on my heel to reenter the shop when as i
stepped on the stone flag put at the bottom
of the steps it tilted somewhat and glancing
downward i noticed that there was appa-
rently a hole under it i stooped over and
found that the stone pulled out with little
difficulty beneath it was a square hole and
leading from it a tunnel large enough for a
man to crawl through with ease on his hands
and knees

the hidden passage

    i got a candle from the store and started
to explore the passageway incidentally it
was the hardest trip i ever took the tun-
nel was at least  feet long and i was
thoroughly tired out when i reached a square
hole at the end here a beam had been put
upright supporting a stone flagging at the
top

   i removed the beam and pushed with all
my might on the stone after a time it gave
way and i climbed through the hole my
candle had gone out while i worked at the
stone climbing to my feet after crawling
through the opening i relit my candle and
by its light saw that i was in the vault of
the bank

  the thing was so simple that it fairly


the railroad mans magazine

took my breath away the vault was built
with heavy brick walls on three sides and on
the roof this was lined with rolled sheet
steel the floor was of cement with a coat-
ing of sheet steel over that

    the bank officials however had foolish-
ly put a layer of oil-cloth on the floor of the
vault and this had concealed the hole which
the thief had drilled through the cement and
the sheeting of the floor strange as it seems
neither the police nor i had thought to lift
that piece of oilcloth it was a lesson to me
which i have never forgotten after i had
replaced the slab of cement over the hole and
put back the beam supporting it i crawled
back through the tunnel to the grocery store
and waited there for the proprietor to return

a confession

  when he came back we put him and his
wife under arrest and after showing them
that i had discovered the tunnel and that we
knew where he had deposited his stealings i
asked him how long it had taken him to dig
the tunnel seeing that the game was up he
acknowledged that he and his wife had been
at work on the bore for six months they
had only been able to work at night for fear
of arousing the suspicions of the neighbors
he had dug the tunnel with a small coal-
shovel taking the earth out in a bifshel bas-
ket they had spread this in layers over the
back yard

   the grocer turned out to be a man named
arthur clapp a crook well known to the
police of new york and several of the large
eastern cities it had become too hot for him
to work in the east any longer so he had
taken the proceeds of his last robbery to buy
the grocery store and stock necessary for his
plot in springfield in all it had taken him
a year to consummate the robbery and he
had planned so he said to retire and live
honestly

  pinkerton was engaged by the lake shore
railroad to solve two train-wrecks later in
which romance played a most unusual part
at intervals of three months two fast trains
on the main line were ditched a short distance
below a small way-station there was abso-
lutely nothing to show what had caused them
the track except for some crushed ties
where the wheels of the trains had struck
them in going off the rails were in perfect
condition and an examination after the
wrecks showed that there was nothing the
matter with the trucks on either of the loco-
motives or the cars

  after the railroad officials had gone over
all the evidence pinkerton was called in
he carefully investigated the circumstances
of the first accident but was unable to reach
any conclusion then came the second dis-
aster and a weeks careful probing brought
no results he was talking to the general
manager about the case one morning when
a thought suddenly struck him

  by jove he said i believe i know
who wrecked those trains

  who was it the general manager
asked

  the station-agent he replied

   why we sent that fellow a letter of
commendation for his good work at both
those accidents the general manager said
he worked like a trojan day and night
while we were clearing away the wreck and
showed that he had keen intelligence

   i cant help it pinkerton said  thats
the only man that could have done it and
im going to look into it

   go ahead the general manager said
but i think youre on the wrong track
pinkerton went out to the little town where
the station-agent was employed and after his
usual custom spent many days in getting ac-
quainted with the people in the place he
didnt go near the station-agent but he soon
found that the latter was paying marked at-
tention to the daughter of a well-to-do farm-
er who lived on the outskirts of the place
pinkerton made an excuse for getting to
know the farmer and stuck to it until he
had been invited to his house for dinner

a woman in the case

  there he met the daughter and he found
her to be the ordinary type of village flirt
dressed in cheap finery and with an exalted
notion of her own charms he seized a favor-
able opportunity to get her to discuss her
many conquests and soon found that the
two principal suitors for her hand were the
station-agent and a man who had been a
soldier in the civil war and had all the
advantage that came of a romantic career
in the army

  the war at that time was fresh in every
ones mind and any man who could lay
claim to war service was a hero in the com-
munity the young woman in a burst of
confidence admitted to pinkerton who had
assumed all along an air of brotherly in-
terest in her affairs that she was divided in
her own mind which of the two to take

  she admitted though that her feelings
pinkerton days on the lake shore



for the station-agent had become warmer
since his gallant work in rescuing the in-
jured and dying from the two bad wrecks
which had recently stirred the countryside
she produced onpinkertons expressing an
interest in the accidents newspaper clippings
telling of the station-agents heroic work and
pinkerton agreed with her that it showed the
young man had lots of grit and courage

  pinkerton had absolutely
no definite evidence against
the agent but he decided to
try a bluff he -went down
to the station the day after
his conversation with the girl
and walked boldly into the
office where the agent was at
work at his telegraph key

  you cant come in her
the agent said angrily  the
public is supposed to stay on
the outside this office is pri-
vate

  pinkerton very deliberately
took off his hat put it down
on the table and sat down in
the only other vacant chair
in the little enclosure with-
out answering the operator
he sat regarding him stead-
ily for a minute or two
drumming with his fingers
on the arm of his chair he
could see that the agent was
nervous under his scrutiny

   i thought i told you to
get out of here   the agent
said again with a manner intended to be
domineering but which had a quaver of un-
certainty back of it which was not lost on the
detective

  pinkerton continued to eye the man stead-
ily and the agent became plainly more and
more ill at ease finally in a very quiet
tone pinkerton said

the bluff that worked

   im a detective in the employ of the
lake shore railroad ive come to arrest
you for wrecking those two trains i know
why you did it and how you did it and in
fact all about it you might just as well own
up and take your medicine it will be bet-
ter for you in the end

  the agents knees gave way under him
and he sank back into his chair

  how do you know i did it he iisked
weakly

  listen to me pinkerton said in an or-
dinary conversational tone as he drew his
rhnir closer to that of the operator

   you are in love with miss smith-dont
deny it he interposed hastily as the agent
started to object  i know all about it
weve talked about you and she says she likes
you she says she thinks youre a fine young
man and shes particularly proud of the

                                       i

work you did in saving the wounded from
those trains in fact she thinks youre a
hero

   ive been in love myself and i know
how hard it is for a man to sit still and see
some one else win the girl he wants himself
you knew miss smith favored that soldier
and you wanted to do something that would
make you appear to advantage in her eyes
as well as to gain the good-will of your em-
ployers i guess you see your mistake now
but its too late and i guess youll have to
come with me

  pinkertons tone and manner was so sym-
pathetic albeit perfectly positive that the
agent gave way he sat silently for a mo-
ment his eyes fixed in a vacant stare and
then suddenly threw his head forward on his
arms and sobbed like a child pinkerton
didnt interrupt him but waited patiently
until the mans nerves steadied finally the
agent sat up


the railroad mans magazine

   im glad its over he said  i couldnt
have stood the strain of the last few months
any longer i havent been able to sleep
and i think i should have killed myself soon
if you hadnt caught me

he seized a favorable opportunity to get
          discuss her many conquests

  on the way to the jail in chicago the agent
confirmed pinkertons theory as to why he
caused the wrecks and told him how he did it

  after making up his mind that in order to
win the girl lie must do something striking
to win promotion and find favor in her eyes
he thought that if he could flag a fast train in
the nick of time and gain credit for heroism

  it would accomplish his purpose accord-
ingly he took a crowbar one night and went
to a deep cut on the line about half a mile
from his station there had been a series
of heavy spring freshets in the previous week
and he thought that they would lend
color to his plan he pried loose a
heavy boulder and sent it rolling
down the bank to the track then
he took his lantern and went up the
track intending to flag the train
to his horror although he waved
the flag frantically neither the en-
gineer nor the fireman saw it he
dashed the lantern into the cab as
the engine passed him but still the
train tore along at full speed and
hit the boulder lying a hundred feet
beyond the force of the impact
was so great that it lifted the boul-
der clear off the tracks and that
is why no explanation could be
found for the wreck

  horrified at what he had done
the station-agent ran down the
tracks to the scene of the wreck
genuinely anxious to do everything
in his power to aid those for whose
injuries he was responsible he
worked like a maniac and it was
his unusual zeal which attracted the
officials- of the road the newspa-
pers heard of his effort and the re-
porters always anxious for a  fea-
ture made him the hero of the
day this blinded him to the enor-
mity of his crime and made him
thirst for still more glory there-
fore with the praises of every one
sounding in his ears he decided to
try the same thing again

  this time he decided to put a steel wedge
on the track and so hardened had his first
immunity made him that he apparently gave
up any idea of stopping the train before it
was wrecked twelve people were killed in
this accident the station-agent was sub-
sequently hanged

railroad fish planting

the lehigh valley railroad is helping the
fish commissioners of new york and penn-
sylvania stock the streams in these two states with
fish the pennsylvania commissioner w e mee-
han has sent out  cans of trout fry from the
harrisburg hatcheries for planting along the line

the company is also cooperating with the new
york commissioner in his efforts to stock the up-

state streams with trout and bass a corps of
trained attendants accompanies each consignment
of fish to see that they are fed at regular intervals
and planted scientifically every effort is made to
transport them with the least possible delay

  the company arranges with outing clubs and in-
dividuals to be on hand when the fish arrive so no
time will be lost in getting them to the water
the best-tailored individual
on the line

           by robert fulkerson hoffman 

somewhere in every large railroad station if you keep your eyes wide
open you will discover this well-dressed individual whose clothes are cut
to fit with a precision and nicety that is seldom to be found in the best tailor-
shops and which have a dash and swagger that could never be obtained in the
most expensive ready-mades

    frequently several of these immaculate individuals who dress very much
alike may be seen ready to make their departure from a big terminal as they
are great travelers and are always on the rail

     no they are not knights of the grip bankers railroad presidents or globe-
trotters once you see them you will be sure to know them by the traveling-
jackets which they always wear and by the simple pattern from which their
garb is made and they are quite fashionable

just try a few guesses and once on the track the solution of the
mystery will soon strike your mental
solar plexus

 fn this day of robust prices of exact
 niceties of dress and of other
 things that have their useful parts
 in helping us to forget that long
  long ago when we crept stealthily
 out of a cavern and cudgel in
 hand procured a new suit of fox-pelt at first
 hand where it grew how would you like to pay
 about two hundred and fifteen dollars for a
  suit of clothes 

    this question of course has nothing to do
 with that gender of mysterious apparel fear-
 fully and wonderfully made which far pass-
 eth the understanding of men it is a mans
 problem solely and it does not contemplate
 the inclusion of a silk hat silk-lined swallow-
 tailed coat low-cut waistcoat and patent-
 leather pumps it has to do only with a very-
 good very plain very nicely fitted business or
 working suit of which you may have seen
 many and never known their value

    we may yet however have to include some-

     	r r

thing of the feminine in this consideration
even at the risk of making our two-hundred
and-fifteen-dollar outfit seem cheap by com-
parison with some parisian creation of the
gentler sort which might loom large before
the mental eye of a reader who does not rejoice
in bifurcated serge or blue jeans

  at any rate if you were standing in any
one of the great railroad terminals say the
union station in boston the grand central
in new york the rock island in chicago
or the union terminal in st louis and the
man who knew should ask of you which
is the best-dressed individual in this throng 
you would be apt to gaze at him in some sur-
prise you might even look around at the
kaleidoscopic throngs about you and then
give up promptly as to the answering very
probably unless you knew your questioner
well you would edge away from him as
politely and as expeditiously as possible

  but if your questioner should be given op-


the railroad mans magazine

portunity to answer his own question cor-
rectly he would say merely  there she
stands and so introduce the only element
of femininity with which this has to do and
as much of individuality as the occasion will
permit by pointing out the big pacific-type
locomotive standing at the head of your train
in the big shed ready to start you across the
continent or to where you will

the glad rags of a locomotive

  if following that answer your questioner
should further ask  what color is a locomo-
tive   you might feel so sure that you knew
the answer as to allow yourself a certain
measure of disdain for so plain a query from
the nature of his questions whether you hap-
pened to be of the railroad fraternity or not
it would be clear to you that your friend the
questioner was either of that keen-witted
brotherhood or close of kin to it and that he
probably had some clear method in his ap-
parent drollery let us see

  once more back to the long ago to the
time of the primitive engine  hero which
will be eminently safe ground as to time then
a locomotive ran naked in the elements with
not even a freshly drawn fox-pelt with which
to cover itself

  later it was found advisable to provide
some sort of protection for them-raiment
clothing a jacket in the language of the
initiated first so far as we know this was
a crude sheathing of wood which did very
well with low steam pressures and corre-
spondingly low resultant temperatures

evolution of an engines jacket

  then with regard for appearances as well
as for durability a sheathing of iron was
added still later a heavy blanket of hair-
felt was first laid closely upon the exterior
of the locomotive boiler over this was care-
fully coopered a close-fitting suit of smooth
pine boards held tightly in plac by thin and
narrow hoops of iron and outside of this
and smoothly encasing the whole a jacket of
thin sheet-brass or of sheet-iron with broad
bands of thin brass was fitted and drawn
tightly to place

   still later it was found that the hair-felt in
a short time charred to dust in the great heat of
the boiler and that the pine boards charred
almost as badly and sometimes caught fire
and burned fiercely under the iron jacket
while the locomotive fanned the flames with
its speed all this was expensive short-lived

exceedingly troublesome and sometimes dan-
gerous due to the blinding of the engineer
by smoke while running fast

  out of all these former glad rags was
evolved the trim and simple double suit that
clothes the locomotive of to-day namely a
complete suit of snowy-white magnesia-asbes-
tos board about one inch thick sometimes
thicker cleated closely upon its russet-red
shell of steel over that a plain and beauti-
fully simple jacket of planished steel of the
familiar blue-gray that flashes by at the head
of every swift-flying limited or plods pa-
tiently along at front end of every heavy-laden
freight train is placed with a skill which
requires the apt calculations of a man well
versed in mathematics and even geometry and
necessitates as deft a cutting and fitting as
that of any tailor

what the wardrobe costs

  this suit as we have elected to call it for
an up-to-date pacific-type passenger locomo-
tive of a proper size to carry cylinders having
a twenty-two-inch diameter and a twenty-
eight-inch stroke costs as we have noted two
hundred and fifteen dollars approximately
and that cost is made up as follows

magnesia-asbestos board 

labor fitting and applying

planished-steel jacket 

labor cutting and fitting labor applying plan-
   ished jacket to engine

total cost labor and material one engine 

  that is to say of the total purchase price
of a locomotive such as we are considering
costing from  to  approxi-
mately   per cent is paid for its mere out-
ward clothing why

  manufacturers of railroad rolling - stock
are not more given than other manufacturers
to the outlay of money solely for appearance
or sentiment even though a certain senti-
ment for locomotives-almost equal to a per-
sonal liking-exists in the minds of most
railroad men the reason then for this
very considerable outlay not far to seek and
familiar to most of us must be practical and
of a definite value in its application re-
duced to its plainest terms it is this

why an engjne needs coverings

  a locomotive stripped of its jacket and
lagging running nakedly in the out of doors
upon its customary schedule would suffer
the best-tailored individual on the line



the same physical loss as a man denuded of
his clothing although not of course in just
the same manner of detail but in case
both were thus exposed and both could sur-
vive the exposure proceeding about their al-
lotted tasks the net result would be in large
measure the same an extravagant loss of
energy

  this fact was early recognized and as we
have seen in some measure provided for in
locomotive practise yet a superficial view
of practise which requires the expenditure of
approximately one dollar and a half out of
every one hundred dollars invested in the
purchase of the superb locomotive of to-day
ranging into thousands of dollars of total first
cost would seem to mark the first-named sum
as a disproportionate and extravagant sum to
be set aside for the mere outward clothing
of a jxigh-power machine

  that conclusion however would be very
far from the fact the jacket in an impas-
sive way and rated by its first cost is one
of the most important dividend-earners on
any locomotive and in fact upon any rail-
road

  we are aware that that is a pretty broad
statement but it is also a statement which
will bear analysis

comparative tests

  in  or  or perhaps a little earlier
some tests were planned and made on the
chicago and northwestern railroad at chi-
cago with a locomotive properly lagged and
jacketed and again with the same locomo-
tive under conditions as nearly similar as
could be obtained for working the locomotive
while it was stripped bare of lagging and
jacket the net result as we recall it was a
clear saving of  per cent of coal used by
the naked engine as compared with that used
by the jacketed engine

  these tests as reported at the time were
made with the locomotive running regularly
upon the road and also while it was at rest
at the west fortieth street shop-yards thus
giving the means of checking up results and
confirming the value of figures obtained

  that the above mentioned percentage of
gain which is quoted from memory and
which is open to confirmation or correction
by any of our northwestern friends who may
chance to see this article was safely con-
servative and wholly within the facts there
can be no doubt the writer while em-
ployed as mechanical engineer of the at-
chison topeka and santa fe railway in

 had opportunity to confirm this on a
somewhat larger although fairly parallel

scale

  there were on the santa fe system at
that time three timber - preserving plants
having a total of eleven large cylinders for
the reception and treatment of timber the
plant at somerville texas had six cylinders
belmont arizona had two and las vegas
new mexico three from this distribution
it will be apparent that the train-haul of
fuel from any available source was long to
some of the plants and the fuel cost corre-
spondingly high

the writers experience

   this with the large dimensions of the cyl-
inders the long periods of maintaining steam
pressure in them during the cooking process
and the fact that up to that time all of these
cylinders were worked with no covering
whatever except the plain board buildings in
which they were installed had attracted at-
tention to the fuel-bills and the advisability
of lagging the preserving cylinders

  looking to that end the writer mapped out
and made a test of one of the cylinders un-
der conditions which were peculiarly well
adapted to the obtainment of reliable data
on the money value of good heat insulation

  the preserving cylinders at the las vegas
plant were of steel nine-sixteenths of an
inch thick having an outside diameter of
about six feet and a length over all of close
to  feet

  to cover one cylinder therefore not in-
cluding the cast-iron hinged door at the head
end which was impracticable at that time
because of a massive and somewhat compli-
cated screw-clamp used for locking re-
quired over  square feet of magnesia-
asbestos lagging

  the preserving process regularly em-
ployed involved briefly the running of a
narrow-gage train load of timber into the
cylinder on suitable small trucks sealing
the door of the cylinder cooking the timber
for some hours under the pressure of live
steam turned in from an adjacent stationary
boiler plant pumping a very low vacuum
turning in the treating solution not heated
and after thorough saturation to the desired
depth was assured returning the treating
solution by gravity to its tank

  from thisit will be seen that there was
an alternate chilling and heating of the great
expanse of cylinder steel to be accomplished
in addition to the heavy loss by radiation
the railroad mans magazine

while the cylinder was under steam pressure
in the big up-and-down board building
which housed that part of the plant rather
loosely

   one of the two boilers in- the stationary
battery was shut off from all connection with
its fellow in preparation for the test and all
other connections of the plant were shut off
except direct connections of this boiler and
the heavy vacuum pump as they were re-
lated to preserving cylinder no  the in-
spirator for the boiler was fed from a tem-
porary tank standing upon a platform scale
thus giving a record by weight of all water
fed to the boiler

   coal fired during the test was carefully
weighed and skilfully used the duty of
the vacuum pump being the same for each
division of the test the steam used for the
pump was set aside as nil all other water
weighed in through the inspirator therefore
represented the amount condensed in the pre-
serving cylinder as will appear-

  on october  the test of preserving
cylinder no  naked was made the cylin-
der was sealed left empty to avoid the factor
of green or seasoned timber and a vacuum
of twenty-one and one-half inches of mercury
was produced in it from the stationary
boiler carrying constantly two gages of water
and a steam pressure of one hundred and
thirty pounds steam was throttled into the
preserving cylinder by john a mclearie
and maintained at a constant average pres-
sure of about twenty-two pounds per square
inch for a period of five hours a pressure-
recording gage gave a definite and graphic
record of the pressure maintained

   between october  and october  this
no  cylinder was carefully lagged with a
coat of magnesia-asbestos board and on
the latter date the first test was duplicated
in every particular the results are tabu-
lated for convenient comparison below

of mine good quality

  to bring about the change of operation
shown had cost  for labor and ma-
terial in lagging the first cylinder experi-
mentally from that experience with com-
mon stock of lagging material it was esti-
mated that the labor cost for lagging other
cylinders with more suitable sizes of board
could be reduced to  per cylinder
bringing the total cost of lagging one cylin-
der down to 

how coal is saved

  the cost of coal used at the las vegas
plant for three cylinders for a period of
seven months preceding that time was by in-
voice  and applying the same
ratio to the total of eleven cylinders for the
whole system the coal cost at belmont and
somerville was higher however the saving
of  per cent of coal as shown by the fig-
ures for the las vegas test made the way
clear to the saving of  in each
lapse of seven months by the single outlay
of  to lag the eleven cylinders at
the labor and material prices then ruling

  all of which brings us through and well
out of the dry-as-dust statistics and to where
the man of the cloth would point his moral
or the logician append his corollary prob-
ably it will serve our need as well however
to call it simply the point and that is

  lag and jacket boilers cylinders and
every other radiating and exposed part that
is accessible as carefully as you would clothe
your body and keep them lagged every
piece of boiler-covering that is removed and
not replaced in hasty repairs every cylin-
der-head or steam-chest that is stripped and
sent out with only its steel casing to cover it
every naked steam-pipe or dome-cap is
draining away power as really as though
each one of them dripped hot water upon
the right-of-way

  this bald fact familiar to most of us and
by most of us too often forgotten is the key
to the reason why a locomotive is russet-red
snowy-white and blue-gray in color why
it is so carefully tailored and why it is the
best-dressed individual in any station throng

when the boomer beat it

by w h wilcox
the candidate for the booby-hatch had him on the

run but at the end of the

he once immaculate mccarty
was a sight to behold huge
rents ventilated each leg of his
overalls which were held in
place by a safety - pin and a
tcnpenny nail in lieu of the
customary buttons the general color scheme
of both overalls and jumper which had
originally been blue was now a sadly mot-
tled combination of black and brown with
here and there a trace of the basic hue still
struggling for existence but waging a losing
battle against the legions of coal-dust oil
and grease which were gradually lending a
shiny enamel-like surface to the cloth

  formerly the word cleanliness had been
symbolical of mccarty in the minds of all
the men on the division but that was be-
fore mrs mccarty had departed on a three
months trip to the old country unfortu-
nately she seemed to have taken all her
worthy spouses love for neatness along with
her and a sad and steady disintegration of
mccartys immaculacy had set in

  it is not to be wondered at then that the
boomer stared in open-mouthed astonishment
at the representative of rags and dirt that
joined the other men beneath the water-tank

  for three months the boomer had been
isolated on the work-train at west farms a

chase positions changed

small hamlet with a population as he ex-
pressed it of one lizzie her mama two
oxen six hens a million sand-fleas and a
hired man before he had departed to rusti-
cate in the west farms sand-pit mccarty
had undoubtedly been the cleanest fireman
on the system

   holy smoke said the boomer  what
has happened to mcirty  

           when the old cats away

           all the mice they will play

   it looks like a big night to-night sang
cyclone brown

  oh thats it is it mrs mccartys
away and macs runnin wild

   yes and aint he an awful-looking ani-
mal to be holdin down the left side of the
nutmeg limited observed old pop mor-
gan

   aw if yer dont like mlooks yer neednt
look at me there aint anything in the
book says yer have ter keep yer eyes glued
on the fireman

   i knew the book of rules before you was
hatched mccarty but ltill say youre an
awful - lookin object to be sharin the cab
with a respectable - lookin man like me
youre enough to drive a man to the insane
asylum


the railroad mans magazine

   yer ought to be down in middletown
anyway retorted mccarty youre about
as near bughouse as any one i know

    speaking of crazy people observed the
boomer  reminds me of an experience i
had when i was lirin on the d and m
holy gee ejaculated punk riley the
boomers dreamin again ill bet he told
fairy tales to the sand-fleas down to west
farms his trip to the gravel-pit didnt do
him any good

    i want you to understand riley that i
dont tell any pipe-dreams whatever stories
i relate are true happenins however if
you dont want to listen to em you neednt
and he arose in offended dignity

   hold on boomer said chub eddy
grabbing the boomers coat-tails and pulling
him back onto the bench

  tell us your experience with the crazy
man well keep that empty head quiet or
throw him in the connecticut wont we
fellers he asked turning to his immediate
followers whereupon such a unanimous
shout of assent issued from those worthies
that riley sat up in sudden apprehension

   on being assured that punks sole hope of
escaping the chilly waters of the river lay in
his absolute silence the boomer began
well you see i was working spare out
of barton one night carter the fellow-
firing the willington scoot sprained his
ankle going home from the roundhouse and
they sent me to dead-head up there and cover
his run in the morning the call-boy didnt
come after me until nearly eleven oclock
and by the time  got over to the engine-
house and secured my overalls the last paj-
senger-train had gone so i fixed it up with
slicky maynard who pulled the night
freight to slow down at willington and let
me off

   everything went along as smooth as
grease till i struck that lonesome one-horse
village  huh says i after droppin off
s back  im sure some glad i dont live
in this dead-and-buried place a fellow of
my disposition would die of monotony here
but it wasnt goin to be any monotonous that
night not on your life though i didnt
know it when i was grumblin to myself of
course

    i hikes over to the operators shanty a
fittle eight-by-ten shack full of levers with
barely room for a chair and operatin -table

     say hank says i rudely awakenin
the key manipulator  stop dreamin about
your country susan and tell a guy where he
can get a bed in this here one-horse burg

    hown thunder dyou spose i know  
says he  you big lopsided coal-heaver i
aint no more rube than you are i live in
barton and come up on  every night

    a thousand apologies says i  i
thought you were a resident of this here
place though i might a known by your
looks you never were hatched in no such cem-
etery as this

  that mollified him somewhat and he in-
formed me that there was a widow woman
lived back of the station vho took boarders
in the absence of any hotel it was me for the
widders and i hot-footed it over to the
house he pointed out from the shanty win-
dow

   after makin a noise like a full-grown
boiler-works or a kids dishpan brigade on
the front door for about half an hour i
finally succeeded in awakenin the guardian
of the place in the shape of a boston bull-
terrier he came gallopin around the cor-
ner lookin in the moonlight as big as a
sheep and displayin a row of teeth like so
many rail-spikes

  i didnt stop for closer acquaintance
oh no

  good-by widder says i and i beats
it for the road fortunately for me there
was a picket fence around the house and
i am a good jumper i took that wooden
separator iji just one leap and i was none
too previous either for doggie was cornin
so close to my heels he couldnt stop when he
put the brakes on and he bumped his dear
little nose against the pickets

   that didnt seem to please him any judg-
in from the racket he started he was just
in the middle of his third or fourth series of
yelps and i was standin across the road
tellin him what i thought of him and any
one who would keep his likes around when
the window over the front-door opened and
a high - pressure narrow - gage sort of a
female in a red flannel nightgown and a
head full of newspaper clippins appeared in
the openin

     if you dont stop that awful language
says she  ill telephone for sheriff jones
you ought to be ashamed of yourself if i
used such talk id be afraid the lord would
strike me dead in my tracks

  you see id skinned my shins getting
over the fence and i guess my conversation
want any too genteel

     madam says i  if you dont like rail-
road talk you hadnt ought to live near the
track

    she started in on a thorough dissection of
when the boomer beat it



the morals of any man that would use pro-
fanity but i didnt stop to hear her doggie
had found a place where there was a loose
picket and was struggling hard to get
through he already had his front feet on
my side of the fence and was stuck in the
middle but squirming so that it looked at
any minute as though his caboose might fol-
low so i pegged a rock at him and retreated
to the operators shanty

     whats the matter bill   asks the op
the minute i poked my head through the
door

    why you red-headed biscuit-faced
dope i got a good mind to put a dent in
your empty skull with this dinner-bucket
says i  why didnt you tell me there was
a small-sized elephant over there  

   to tell you the truth says he  i for-
got the dog

    well this airit gettin me any bed do
you know any other place here where they
take boarders and dont keep any canines
around  

    no says he  guess you will have to
sleep in the coaches to-night

  guess again rosy said i youre
about as handy at guessin as a cow with a
musket must be you want me to freeze to
death id look nice wouldnt i the last
of november no steam on those coaches and
little willie bein slowly refrigerated nay
pauline i guess i can manage to get a few
hours sleep on the roof of the cab its
warm in the engine-house anyway i seized
my dinner-pail and started for the door

    i look out for the watchman there called
the op after me  hes been in the bug-
house at tewksbury for the last year and
though they have pronounced him cured he
still acts rather queer and is liable to break
out again any time

     tell that pipe-dream to the despatcher
says i thinkin he was tryin to kid me

   i hiked over to the roundhouse hunted
up a bundle of waste for a pillow and
crawled up on the roof of the  looked
all around the house and made racket enough
for a dozen men but no sign of the watch-
man did i see

  i dont know how long i slept majbe
a half an hour perhaps three-quarters but
when i did waka up it was some sudden and
with a sense of something wrong there was
something wrong too about the first thing
my eyes lighted on was the watchman coinin
up over the runnin-board with an ax in his
hand

   his head was just on a level with the

cab-roof and the light from one of the house-
lamps shone full on his face one look was
enough to tell me he had gone plumb crazy
again of all the devilish expressions i ever
saw his was certainly the capper

  you can bet it wasnt more than the six-
teenth part of a second before i was on my
way over the coal-pile for the back of the
tank and i didnt linger none in gettin off
that tender either

   soon as he saw he was discovered he
let out an unholy shriek that sent the cold
chills racin up and down my spine by regi-
ments and took after me i was goin a
pretty good gait when i left the back of that
tank but when he let out another one of
those terrifyin yells of his it added about
ten miles an hour to my runnin powers
round and round the engine-house we went
in a regular indoor marathon with me look-
in for a place to get out and him swingin
that ax and lettin out a blood-curdlin yell
every time we passed the 

   i surely thought it was all up with me
about the twelfth lap my heart was poundin
like a c v compound both feet weighed
about a ton apiece and there was a funny
feelin across the back of my head an im-
aginary line just where i figured the ax
would strike

  what the outcome would have been had
nothing interfered with the lunatics sprint-
in powers i hate to think happily for
me though he slipped on a greasy spot on
the concrete floor and slid into one of the
vacant pits that gave me time while he
was scramblin out to draw the bolt on one
of the doors and jump outside 

   but just because i stood outside that
engine-house didnt give me any time to
waste no sir mr crazy guy was out of
that pit in an instant and after me the next

   it was a bright moonlight night and
you could see everything plain as day for
two miles i was too near all in for to at-
tempt a cross-country race with the lunatic
and his ax so i ran around the corner of the
engine-house lookin for some place to hide
or for a club so that when the end came id
stand some show in the fight i was bound
id put up

   i had hardly turned the corner when i
ran plumb into a ladder standing up against
the side of the house it reached clear up to
the roof and looked so invitin that i didnt
stop to wonder how it came there but climbed
as fast as i could work my feet at that i
just stepped off the top rung onto the flat
tarred roof when buggy started up from the


the railroad mans magazine

bottom i let him get half-way up and then
suddenly turned the ladder over

   he wasnt lookin for any more like that
and consequently was shaken off droppin
pretty hard on the top of an old tank that lay
next the wall for a few minutes he lay
there without a move while i hauled the
ladder up on the roof

   i thought at first he was killed but for a
while i was too nearly winded to try any
fancy investigatin stunts so i laid down on
the roof and watched him over the edge
soon i noticed his head was almost imper-
ceptibly turning so he could get one eye on
me and i concluded he was playin possum

  not so youd notice it bill says i
 you can play youre dead as long as you
want to but little willie stays right up here
till help arrives

   he stayed there a couple of minutes after
i said my little piece to him then all of a
sudden jumped up and off thetank and
made for the turntable he spotted the
table opposite the stall where the  lay in
which position there was a straight track
from the back of that pit clear across the
table over the ash-pit by the water-plug
out to the switchon the laurent branch

   i was wondering what he was up to
when bang the  comes out of the house
takin the door with her runs across the
table down the runnin track and through
the switch out onto the branch he stopped
to clear the switch got off lined up the iron
and climbed back into the cab the next
minute the  starts up the line toward
salem junction gathering speed with every
revolution of the drivers and rippin the ex-
hausts out of her stack like a gatlin-gun

   i stood there on die roof listenin to the
sound of her steam until it had become
almost imperceptible then suddenly i
remembered the horn freight out of salem
junction at  and that if it was on time
it would just about meet the lunatic with
the light engine in snake hollow

   i didnt lose any more time listenin for
the sound of the s exhaust but dumped
my ladder over the edge and slid down the
side-pieces i hardly think my feet touched
the ground before i was on my way for the
operators shanty

   call up salem and stop the horn
bill i yelled bustin in the door

  what for he asks real sleepily but
nevertheless reaching for the instrument

    that crazy watchmans got the  out
on the branch and is headed for salem at
seventy miles an hour

    click-click-clickety-click-click he banged
away with the key in a regular fever of ex-
citement while the perspiration started down
his face

     its no use he says  i cant get salem
theres something the matter with the wire
ill call up barton and see if the despatcher
can get him by way of lovell over the east-
ern division hed hardly cut his main-
line instrument when i thought i heard
somethin coinin and sure enough when i
looked up the branch through the ops win-
dow there was the  cornin back like a
whirlwind you could just see a black spot
in the moonlight away up the long piece of
straight iron looming against the snow but
i knew from the pall of black smoke that
floated aavay over the white tops of the trees
that it was an engine and it could only be
the 

   when is  due here  i demanded

   says he

    gimme that red light i yells climbin
over a forest of levers and breakin for the
door

     theres no tellin but what that lunatic
will run through the main-line switch and
its  right now

   cant bellows the op  they put a
derail in on the branch yesterday i only
hope he tries it if hell get the  off here
so he cant move her well have a chance to
flag the horn maybe all the time poundin
away at his key

     great scott says he suddenly crump-
lin up in his chair

    barton says the horn left salem four
minutes ago

   come on i yells  we got to stop him
somehow

   how we goin to do it  asks the op
we were already half way to the engine-
house switch

     if he dont run the signal and go off
the derail hell have to stop before he gets to
it and we got to jump on the pilot when she
goes by and pull the angle-cock open that
will set the brakes on her and he cant
move as long as there is sufficient air in
the brake cylinders to keep the brakes on
tight

  luck was with us that night had we
prearranged even move the whole business
could hardly have passed off more smoothly
the  rolled to a stop with the rear of the
tank directly opposite the place where we
were crouched every muscle tense and vi-
brant awaiting the proper moment for a
spring that would land us on the pilot of
when the boomer beat it



course all we had to do then was to step over
and turn the angle-cock on the back of the
tank and the  became as helpless as 
dead cow

   up on the cab we could hear the lunatic
throwin the lever back and forth and swear-
in cuss words of all colors

  hell be down in a minute says i
 and its up to us to think up some kind of
a reception for him when he comes

  we were standing close to the section
shanty with its usual pile of scrap-iron to
one side

   the op suddenly sprang over to the heap
of odds and ends and in a jiffy was back
with a piece of iron pipe about three feet
long which he thrust into my hand

     stand close up to the edge of the ten-
der he says  and ill show myself on that
side when he makes after me you be ready
and the instant he goes by the end of the tank
wallop him on the block as hard as you
can

  all right oppie says i and the next
minute the op was up alongside the cab spit-
tin out cuss words at mr bug-house

    i stood close up to the edge of the tank
my pipe upraised and all ready to put the
whole of my hundred and eighty pounds in-
to a blow that would send the lunatic to
dreamland but i was so excited i nearly let
the operator have it instead of the watchman
when it did land it went straight to the
mark and the poor wretch crumpled up like
a rag-doll

    i thought id killed him at first but we
found on investigation he was only stunned
so the op went after the bell-rope to tie him
with while  stood over him to administer
another piece of persuasion if he came back
to life too soon

  no sir i reckon there wasnt anything
monotonous about that night and the
boomer paused reminiscently

  aw say interrupted punk if youd
tell that story to a mule hed kick your head
off

  this remark of rileys was apparently
just what chub eddy and his followers were
awaiting for with one accord they arose and
fell on his startled punkship the squirm-
ing heaving tangled mass of heads arms
and legs presently resolved itself into a
group headed for the river and carrying the
futilely struggling punk in their midst

  hey ejaculated windy sanderson wi-
ping the perspiration from his face with one
hand and keeping the fingers of the other
closely clutched in a death-like grip on one
of rileys ankles

    its too far to carry this big ox over to
the river lets tie him to the drain gate un-
der the old plug and drop the lever the
waiter comes in a rush there and itll be just
the same as droppin him in the connecti-
cut

  a unanimous shout of approval greeted
this suggestion and soon the unfortunate
riley lay atop the drain grating with six
gleeful firemen superimposed upon his still
struggling but somewhat exhausted anatomy
while a seventh hot-footed it to the engine-
house after a piece of bell-rope

  so taken up with riley and his coming
punishment were they that one and all
failed to observe the boomer lift the link off
the lever governing the water-valve their
first indication that anything was amiss with
their plans occurred when the eight-inch
stream of icy water descended upon their
tousled heads

  bewildered drenched and gasping for
breath they stumbled and rolled from be-
neath the watery deluge in time to see the
boomer streaking across the field back of the
engine-house to the accompaniment of the
cheerful tones of the dinner-bell wielded
vigorously by mother jones from the door
of the boarding-house

  for an instant the boomer paused in the
door and surveyed the dripping watery pro-
fane group lined up along the railroad fence
then with a seraphic smile and a hand-flip
of derision he disappeared

what is the best and most concise description
of a locomotive which you can quote

         	what is meant by the gooch valve
motion-c h binghamton new york

  	a self-propelled vehicle running on rails for
the purpose of hauling cars it may be operated
by steam electricity gas from volatile oils or com-
pressed air few compressed-air locomotives have
been built but they resemble steam locomotives in
general design and mode of utilizing the exhaustible
fluid

  steam locomotives consist of a boiler and engine
mounted on a frame supported on wheels these
wheels are turned by the engine the boiler con-
tains water and has a fire-box forming part of it
in which fuel is burned to supply heat to the water
and convert it into steam

  the steam passes through a valve called a throt-
tle-valve thence through pipes to the steam-chests
from which valves operated by a connection from
the main shaft or axle or from the csank-pin as in
the instance of the walschaert gear automatically
admit it alternately to each end of the cylinders
and exhaust it therefrom into the atmosphere
through the exhaust-pipes and stack

  the expansive force of the steam moves the pis-
tons piston-rods and crossheads back and forth
and as the crosshead moves in guides and has
one end of the main rod connected to it at the
wrist-pin while the other end of the main rod is
connected to the crank-pin on the driving-wheel the

reciprocating motion of the piston is thereby
changed into a rotary motion of the driving-wheels

  a locomotive thus transforms stored-up or po-
tential energy of fuel into the kinetic energy or
mechanical work of propelling itself and hauling
cars

  the gooch is a valve motion employingtwo
eccentrics link link-block and rocker very similar
to the stephenson motion but differing from it in
having the link stationary

  on the whole it greatly resembles the motion used
by thatcher perkins on his famous baltimore and
ohio ten-wheel engines of about fifty years ago
it is not in general use

hat are the dangers to which engineers and
  firemen are exposed by their work on the
  engine-j h e baltimore maryland

  engineers and firemen are not only exposed to
bodily injury or even death in many accidents
which may happen to their engine but unless they
are very careful to preserve their health it is quick-
ly destroyed by the constant changes of the weather
to which their position exposes them and also by
the effect of the heat of the fire and by smoke the
coal gases which pour out of the furnace-door if
it is opened when the throttle is closed have an
especially injurious effect on the throat and lungs

  the steady loud clatter which an engine makes
while running has an injurious effect on many


by the light of the lantern



nervous systems engineers as a rule endeavor to
lessen these shocks of the engine by keeping close
watch over it and endeavoring to maintain the
proper adjustment of its parts

  owing to the demand which their daily labor
makes upon their strength and endurance locomo-
tive engineers must be careful not to increase the
strain by dissipation irregular hours or overwork
there seems to be something about the power of
endurance of the human frame analogous to the
capacity of a bar of iron or steel to resist strains
so long as the strains do not exceed the elastic
limit-that is if the bar recovers its original length
when the strain is removed-it will bear millions
of such strains without becoming weaker but if it
is strained so hard that it is permanently stretched
then comparatively few applications of the force
will rupture the bar

  in a similar way if the strain or fatigue which
a man endures is no more than he will recover
from after an ordinary rest he can endure an al-
most unlimited number of such strains but if the
fatigue exceeds his  elastic limit then he soon be-
comes permanently injured

  the sixteen-hour law now of general applica-
tion practically prohibits the working of excessive-
ly long hours and makes the matter of proper rest
between intervals of duty mandatory on the part
of the railroads and the employees as well



gw t knoxville tennessee-the strain on
 the cylindrical part of a boiler can be cal-
culated by multiplying its diameter in inches by its
length in inches and its product by the steam pres-
sure per square inch thus for a boiler  inches
in diameter and  feet long with  pounds pres-
sure the calculation would be  x  x -
 pounds the reason for multiplying by the
diameter instead of by the circumference is because
only a portion of the pressure on the inside sur-
face of the boiler exerts a force to burst the shell at
any one point

how many pounds of steam does it take to
     whistle for crossings stations etc

          are there any locomotives running
which require two firemen

   who is the oldest operator on the chicago
milwaukee and st paul railroad-a w b
lima center wisconsin

   the amount of steam expended for such a
purpose is insignificant in view of the free steaming
qualities of modern locomotive boilers and would
have no appreciable effect on the steam-gage unless
the whistling were unduly prolonged since it
would have no effect on the steam-gage it is impos-

sible to answer your question as the gage is the
measure of boiler-pressure

   	we cannot recall any such at this writing
and feel safe in stating that all engines in this coun-
try at least are fired by one man

range why not address the chief train-despatcher

vicinity

motion than in the back motion and if so
what is the reason for the difference-

 what is the heaviest narrow-gage locomotive
 built and what kind is it

   	are there any narrow-gage pullmans built
 and if so how many compartments are there and
 how arranged

   	are any chair-cars built for narrow-gage
  roads and how many will they seat-c w

 greeley colorado

   	address h k porter  co locomotive
 builders pittsburgh pennsylvania who are in a
 position to give you definite information since
 the general widening of narrow-gage roads our rec-
 ords are somewhat hazy regarding that class of
 power but the above firm has turned out many
 of them and will no doubt be pleased to advise you

   	a comparison of the performance of com-
 pound freight-locomotives with that of simple or
 single-expansion freight locomotives as included in
 the report of the tests made on the locomotive test-
 ing plant of the pennsylvania railroad at the st
 louis exposition in  were very favorable to
 the compounds for a given amount of power at
 the draw-bar the poorest compound showed a sa-
 ving in coal over the best simple averaging above
 ten per cent while the best compound showed a
 saving over the poorest simple not far from forty
 per cent

   it should be remembered however that the con-
 ditions of the above tests which provided for the
 continuous operation of the locomotive at constant
 speed and load throughout the period covered by
 the observations were all favorable to the com-
 pounds

directly answering your question it may be said

that the compound locomotive at least so far a
these thorough tests established was stronger
on the draw-bar pull than the simple engine the
steam pressures being equal-compared with sim-
ple locomotives doing the same kind of work-com-
pounds show a saving in coal and water of from
twenty to thirty per cent

  stated in another way the compound develops
from twenty to thirty per cent more power than the
simple engine of the same type consuming an equal
amount of fuel and water

  liability to breakdowns and cost of repairs are
items that usually show a balance in favor of the
simple engine but where intelligently handled and
maintained the advantages of the compound out-
weigh these defects

   and  all elaborate narrow-gage passen-
ger-car equipment including the types which you
mention disappeared with the application of stand-
ard gage to the denver and rio grande road and
to the mexican national railway when narrow-
gage roads these two lines had a splendid equip-
ment of pullmans and chair-cars and these were
so admirably proportioned that it was difficult to
realize the difference in the gage of track the

  	anthracite or hard coal differs from bitu-
minous or soft coal in the fact that it contains a
much larger proportion of carbon and less of hydro-
gen and that it consequently gives off very little or
no coal-gas its combustion is therefore more
simple than that of bituminous coal as there is very
little else than solid carbon to burn it is usually
burned on a very long grate and as the heat is very
intense the grate-bars are usually made of iron
tubes through which a current of water circulates
so as to prevent them from melting these tubes
are screwed into the front or tube-sheet of the fire-
box and are fastened with tapered thimbles in the
back ends which are driven into holes in the back
sheet so as to make a tight joint around the tube

  as these tubes are so fastened in the sheets they
are immovable and it is necessary that some means
be provided for drawing the fire from the fire-box
this is done by using solid bars instead of tubes
at intervals which rest on a support or bearing-
bnr at the front end and at the back end of the
fire-box pass through tubes in the sheets through
which they -nay be withdrawn when it is desired
to remove the fire

  there are of course many variations in grate
arrangements for hard-coal burners but all are on
the same general plan with water-bars

  	never heard of the corliss valve-gear in

of course a lifelong friend in stationary engine prac-
tise the stephenson link motion the walschaert
gear and the joy gear are commonly employed for
the purpose of actuating the slide-valve of engines
in this and foreign countries but there is another
less used called the gooch valve motion which may
be the one to which you refer in this latter valve
motion the link is hung with its curvature reversed
to its usual position and in some cases is driven
by eccentrics on an axle ahead of it if you will
send a rough sketch of the motion which you have
in mind we will quote the approved practise in ma-
king adjustments

   	the best method is to take the valve out and
do the job right you can however push the valve
against the front exhaust port mark the steam in
that position and if you have the valve and port
dimensions measure for the rest of it all such


the railroad mans magazine

practises however are unsatisfactory arising from
the liability to error when so many sizes are being
added

  	a fair job can be done by making a template
from the old cylinder saddle which you have re-
moved assuming of course that you have refer-
ence to repair work for instance applying one new
cylinder to an engine in the instance of new work
it is advisable to put the cylinder up and mark it
off the editor of this department however does
recall a device for this purpose which he noticed
in the shops of the baltimore and ohio railroad
over twenty years ago it was a wooden structure
shaped like an inverted  t the bottom being
curved to the inner curve of the smoke-arch to which
the new cylinders were to be fitted

  from the upright part of the inverted t a
pendulum scriber was hung and adjusted to exact-
ly sweep the outside curve of the smoke-box this
being effected the machine was removed from the
smoke-box and set up on the saddles of the two new
cylinders which of course had been previously
bolted together it only remained to scribe the
front and back saddle-flanges with the pendulum
mentioned the length of which had been deter-
mined as above explained

  these lines so scribed on the front and back sad-
dle-flanges were continued by means of a straight
edge on the side-flanges and they were chipped
the writers recollection is that they got very good
results from the device although it has long since
been abandoned

  	it depends entirely on the metal composing
the wheel the proper allowance to be made is
largely if not entirely a question of judgment ex-
perience and the feel of the calipers

  	the walschaert valve-gear was first intro-
duced into this country in connection with the balti-
more and ohio locomotive no  built at the
schenectady works of the american locomotive
company in  this engine was also the first
mallet compound after much experimenting the
walschaert gear received the unqualified indorse-
ment of a w gibbs general superintendent of
motive power of the pennsylvania railroad and in
all probability that road has more locomotives so
equipped than any other although the new york
central lines are making a general application

  space limitations forbid giving a description of

the baker-piliiod valve-gear as much as we would
like to oblige and the same applies to your request in
regard to a valve-setting problem in the walschaert

gear

  the editor of the railroad mans magazine
however advises that in connection with the latter
motion an early article will deal with the subject
from every angle and in particular will thoroughly
explain the procedure in usual and unusual cases
as indicated by the marks on the valve-stems

some new experiences of the knights of the grip that will make other
travelers hold on to their buttons and ask for the pedigrees
of their smoking-compartment acquaintances

  an interrupted game

omebody in the group in the
  smoking - compartment of the
  sleeper had just unburdened him-
  self of a mournful tale of how he
  had fallen a victim to the game of
  a card-stacker in chicago

     thats about the only kind of
bad luck that never reached me said
george munroe who travels for a brooklyn
hat factory but there was a time when it
gave me a pretty close call

   there were three of us sol goldman
out from bond street with  the finest shirts
on earth and fred kress whose specialty
is razors were the other two we were all
trekking for home by way of the big four
when kress suddenly caught the poker fever

   sol thought a four-hander would be
more interesting and somewhere in the train
he managed to dig up a stranger who had
such an open honest face that we all thought
he was the real goods

  we hadnt dealt half a dozen hands be-
fore the three of us began to tumble to the
fact that the stranger was no spring chicken
at the game he was wiping up everything
on the board

  luck why with the luck he had he
could have gone out in his back yard and
discovered a gold-mine before long he had

us all so flustered that we wouldnt bet more
than a white chip on a straight flush

  we gradually got a strong hunch how-
ever that the stranger wasnt playing a
straight game and we made up our minds
that wed better quit if we didnt want to live
on bananas the rest of the way home

    ive got a bad headache sol was say-
ing by way of getting out but he didnt fin-
ish the sentence he didnt have to for the
stranger suddenly- slammed his cards down
on the table and jumped to his feet quick
as a cat in a second he was down the aisle
and disappearing at the end of the car

  we were at a station at the time taking
on passengers pretty soon the train rolled
out but he didnt come back we waited
and waited a quarter of an hour went by
but still no stranger

   one of the passengers in our car was a
fat man who had just got aboard he want-
ed to know what the stranger looked like
we told him he was a tall slender chap
with black eyes and a scar on his chin for
a moment he looked as if wed handed him
a big surprise

  then he began to dig into his inside
pockets he pulled out a poster with a
mans picture on it-and it was the picture
of our missing fourth hand perhaps youve
heard of roy smith who broke out of jo-
liet where hed been sent for grand larceny


the railroad mans magazine

 all-round gambler and bad man and one
 of the slickest card-sharps in the west
 well he was the man

   the fat man he was from the chi-
 cago central office-chicago or buffalo i
 forget which anyway he was a detective
 and our fourth hand must have seen him
 coming in at onend of the car just in time
 to get out at the other

    i was the banker of that game and i
 owe that runaway convict twenty-two dol-
  lars and thirty cents sol and fred kress
 have been after me for years to split it up
 between us but i say no that western
 crook may come for it some day-if the po-
 lice dont get him first

peterss hair-restorer

 peaking of fat men remarked har-
 vey small one of the roadmen from
 the broadway clothing district some of
 you boys must know harry peters the shoe-
 bagger perhaps you dont know how he
 got his experience as a roadman it was
 selling hair-tonic-his own preparation
 quite a jump from hair-tonic to shoes but i
 guess he likes shoes better theres all kinds
 of bad luck goes with hair-tonic

   that particular preparation of his was
 more than a tonic it was a hair-grower
 guaranteed to grow hair on bald heads in-
 side of a month to hear peters tell about
 it youd think it would make frayed hair-
 cloth furniture as good as new or a bil-
 liard-ball look like a powder-puff in a week
 you could sprinkle it on your mangy house-
 cat and have an angora in thirty days

    it was a wonder of wonders that prepa-
 ration-either that or peters was a wonder
 as a truth-destroyer hed put a couple of
 thousand dollars-all the money he had-
 into his hair-grower figured on making a
 million or so and retiring but as i said
 theres no luck in hair-growers

   the first way peters exhibited his busi-
 ness sagacity was in getting the top of his
 head shaved as smooth as ivory then he
 started out on the road with his preparation
 the drug-store people wanted to know why
 his restorer wouldnt grow hair on his own
 bald head peters told em to wait a while

    it was a brand-new remedy he explained
 and he hadnt had time to experiment with
 it in his own case though hed seen it work
 wonders in others he told em he soaked
 -his own head in it twice a day and was look-
 ing for quick results

   he had been out on the road a few
weeks and began to double back over the
same route there was thick black hair
half an inch long all over his bald top it
was a brand-new idea in advertising and it
certainly made those druggists sit up and
take notice

  but the trouble with that game was that
it wasnt good for more than one season
the druggists finding the stuff didnt come
up to peterss prophecies were all over-
stocked and wouldnt have anything more to
do with it then some man down south
claimed the stuff had turned his hair from
red to green and sued peters for ten thou-
sand dollars damages

   what became of the suit i dont know
but peters was but hustling for a job before
long that hair-grower ruined him thats
why hes selling shoes to-day hes grown
as bald as a bat but its no use trying to get
him to experiment with any hair-growers
he cant bear to hear em mentioned

a matrimonial gold brick

xhe ensuing talk about bald heads and
their causes reminded frank rolfe a
newark hardware salesman of sam lewis
who used to travel for a broadway millinery
house and whose cousin he had met a few
days before in st louis

    sam was a living illustration of the fact
that its worry that causes baldness de-
clared rolfe

   after his unfortunate matrimonial affair
he grew as bald as an eagle that marriage
of his shows that a man ought to stick strict-
ly to his employers business when hes on
the road but sam always had an eye out
for the ladies and was always talking about
how he meant to marry rich and retire

     any man can do it hed say  if hes
only got sense enough the world is full of
single women with fat bank accounts look-
ing for husbands look at all the rich
mens daughters and at all the rich widows
there must be a million of em its a good
deal easier to propose to one of em in the
space of ten seconds than it is to work for
twenty years selling goods

   one day while sam was running west on
the central he saw a good-looking woman in
the next seat who had a pint of diamonds
sprinkled over her she had a fur coat that
must have cost a mint of money too and it
was easy to see she must be well fixed

   he kept his eyes glued on her and on
told in the smoker



the fur coat and the diamonds and as he
couldnt see any wedding-ring decided she
must be single he got a chance to get into
conversation with her and before they got
to chicago hed proposed and had been ac-
cepted they were married the very next
day

   sam sent back word to his friends that
hed married a million and he began to think
about throwing up his job but it wasnt
half a day after the wedding when his bride
told him she had a confession to make

   shed been married before and had di-
vorced her husband he had to pay her a
good fat alimony but that would stop now
that shed married again outside of the
alimony she didnt have a cent and her dia-
monds were most of em paste but she was
sure sam hadnt married her for mercenary
reasons and wouldnt mind about that

  after sam had pretty near worried him-
self to death over that development she an-
nounced shed got another confession to make
he must be prepared to meet her children
she had five of em

   well you dont suppose ive got to sup-
port another mans children do you   gasped
sam  whats the matter with his support-
ing em 

    but theyre not his she explained
 when i married him i was a widow and
i had em all then

  to add insult to injury that divorced
husband met sam a while after that and
told him he wished him joy-that he had
to thank him for lifting a load of trouble
off his shoulders



  cupid foils a robbery

rphere was the case of tom wales
said terrercc murphy of maiden
lane  he was running out of detroit
one day when he fell in with a nice-looking
young fellow who told him he was traveling
about the country for pleasure by the
time they got to cincinnati the stranger
knew waless line and had a pretty good
idea of the value of the goods he was carry-
ing as a matter of fact wales had fifty
thousand dollars worth of jewelry locked
up in a big case

  they both went to the same hotel the
next morning wales called a cab to take him
to the train and while the cab was wait-
ing outside he gave a porter a quarter to
watch the jewelry-case in the lobby the
case was asibig as a small trunk so there

   	rr

didnt seem to be much danger of losing it

as soon as waless back was turned along
came the new - made friend told the
porter who had seen the two together that
he would take the case to the cab hurried
outside with it jumped into the cab and
told the cabby to drive somewhere

  did they get him they havent yet
hes one-of the few crooks that ever slipped
through the far-stretched net of the jewel-
ers protective association but his capture
isnt so necessary for the jewelry has all
come back two months after the robbery
more than half of it came in a lump from
some place in the west

  then came a letter without a signature
explaining that the writer was the thief who
had taken the jewelry and that hed fallen
in love with a nice girl and was conscience-
stricken he told her the whole story and
had promised her hed send every bit of the
stolen jewelry back the rest of it came
piece by piece and it took more than a year
before it all got back to maiden lane evi-
dently hed hocked part of it and had been
getting it out of pawn in instalments as fast
as he could afford it

the absinth diamond

t know a better maiden lane story
a than that said a man with an enor-
mous black pearl in his tie

   its the story of the absinth diamond
if you know anything about jewels youll
know that the absinth diamond when its of
any size and perfect is one of the rarest and
most valuable stones in the world its just
about the same dusky whitish green as ab-
sinth and theres a weird light in it thats
enough to give a man the jim-jams

   martin crosby whos retired now but
was for a long time a well-known diamond
salesman was riding in a day car on the
santa fe in colorado in  he noticed
in the next seat a shabby young chap wear-
ing a sombrero and looking like a ranch-
man

   the next moment crosbys eyes pretty
near popped out of his head with surprise
in the tie the young man was wearing was
an absinth diamond of at least three carats
crosby was over talking to him inside of
thirty seconds he got a good long look at
the stone and he was dead sure it was genu-
ine but the mystery was how did this
shabby young ranchman come to have it

 crosbys firm had been looking for just


the railroad mans magazine

such a stone he asked if the young man
wanted to sell it yes he thought he would
if he could get a hundred dollars for it for
he was broke of course it looked like a
case of thief right away but crosby fol-
lowed the man up found that he was a
young englishman with a wife and baby and
that the were almost starving to death out
on a little ranch where the irrigating ditch
had run dry and the crops had failed

   the diamond was an heirloom the young
mans only inheritance for his parents for-
tune had been swept away before he came to
america crosby investigated and was con-
vinced that the story was true but he
wasnt small enough to take advantage of the
mans ignorance of the stones value and
after getting in touch with his firm he of-
fered him seven thousand dollars for it the
money came just in time to save the eng-
lishmans farm from foreclosure

   seven years went by one day that young
englishman appeared in maiden lane he
had become one of the richest whcat-farmers
in montana and he had come east to hunt
for his absinth diamond at length he
found it in a store on fifth avenug where
for years it had been lying in the safe he
paid twenty thousand dollars for it

    i promised my mother whos been
dead many a year that id never part with
that stone unless i had to he explained  i
sold it because i was down to my last dollar
and didnt want to see my wife and child
go hungrv but i always meant to get it
back

when the sun was late

toes anybody remember cy burrill
the alarm-clock man no he didnt
sell alarm-clocks shirts were his line but
he practised with a vengeance the theory that
the early bird catches the worm and he
always carried an alarm-clock with him
to rout him out of bed at the most unearthly
hours i will take my oath that the full
extent of his personal baggage was that
alarm-clock and a comb

   i had a grudge against cy and his old
clock for i once shared a room in a crowded
hotel with him and had been routed out by
his buzzer before daylight lying over a
night in ashland new hampshire i ran
across cy and a fellow named joe wether-
bee and after cy had gone to bed-as
usual with the chickens-i told joe that
story

   well heres your chance to get even
said joe  cys going to take that six-
thirty train down to nashua in the morning
hes a sound sleeper and well go up and
twist the hands of his buzzer ahead about
four hours and a half and hell get up in
time for the  am there are no locks on
these country hotel doors

   joe and i waited up to see our scheme
work about ten minutes of two cy came
scurrying down-stairs in a hurry with his
clock under his arm for hed overslept he
thought no proprietor around no break-
fast but he didnt have time to wait

   he lit out for the station and got there
just as the two oclock train rolled in hed
been wondering why in thunder it was so
dark we were down at the station to
make sure that he got away and as the
train pulled out he stuck his head out of the
window stared up at the stars and said
by gum its the latest sunrise i ever
saw 

a grateful hobo

 tts surprising how many romances a

  a man tumbles into on the road ob-
served george munroe who had told the
poker story  coming down from seattle
on the s p our train stopped for water
in the woods nea the california border one
morning and some of us got out for exer-
cise

   a ragged soot-blackened young fellow
scrambled down from the roof of one of
the sleepers where hed been riding all night
and asked one of us to get him a glass of
water he gulped the water down like a
thirst-crazed man in the desert and i found
out that he hadnt eaten in about twenty-
four hours

   i went into the diner and when we made
our next stop i called to him and he came
scrambling down i handed him half a doz-
en sandwiches and half a dollar he was the
most grateful chap i ever saw and he went
at those sandwiches like a famished wolf

   about a year after that i drifted into
goldfield on a round-up of the nevada hat
dealers i had lost my roll somewhere in the
train i was wondering what i was going
to do for money

   i was getting a bite in a restaurant and
was telling my tale of wo to a chance ac-
quaintance at the counter when a young chap
tapped me on the shoulder and remarked
 i can help you out with a hundred or two
told in the smoker



he went to the cash drawer and pulled out
a roll of bills  im making barrels of money
feeding miners in this boom town he said
 so you neednt think i cant spare it

  it was too much of a mystery for me i
was dazzled  is this the way you usually
treat strangers out here i asked

    well sometimes says he  if youll
take a good look at me perhaps youll remem-
ber the fellow you saved from starving on
the s p last year 

  just then the porter put his head in

   can any of you gents change a five-dollar
bill  he inquired

   i can said harvey small digging into
his pocket and taking the fiver  heres
four ones and a half-dollar you can keep
the other half-dollar for yourself

   thanks boss returned the porter and
he went away smiling gratefully

  arent these porters wonders cried
small  ive worked that game time and
time again and they always bite but the
porter came back

 doing the samaritan act

 tts pretty tough for a man to be stripped
of all the coin hes got when hes on
the road remarked tom bowles the under-
wear man

   ive had that experience myself and i
know but its harder still on a woman she
simply goes into hysterics in such a plight
ive always had a notion that it was a case

like that that boosted jim corning to the job

of manager of one of the biggest concerns
in chicago

   ten years ago jim was on the road for the
house hes with now he was a young fellow
just breaking into the business once as he
was going into the diner for breakfast on the
c b and q he noticed an old lady crying
he asked the conductor about her and
learned that she had been robbed of all her
money during the night

   he went over and spoke to her and she
told him she was going through to denver
and was worrying over how she was going
to buy food on the way he pulled out
twenty dollars and insisted on her taking it
as a loan she consented and took his name
and address

   a few days later the money came back
to him in the mail and with it a note of
thanks from his boss who explained that
it was his mother he had helped jim
began to climb right up toward the top in
that house from that time and i guess it
was largely because the boss remembered
what hed done

   those sympathetic yarns  growled
terry murphy they dont go with me-
not since i lent a girl in the same fix ten
dollars and found shed been working that
game on all the roads in the country of
course if id been born lucky like corning
shed have turned out to be the daughter
of my boss but i must have come into the
world under some other kind of a star

disinfecting passenger gars

german railroad uses original method of ridding trains of vermin and

   deadly bacteria

between the ordinary method of cleansing
railway passenger-coaches with the house-
cloth broom and the cushion-beater ordinarily in
vogue in this country and the scientific processes
developed in germany there is all the difference
in the world perhaps the conditions of interna-
tional traffic in europe account for the advance in
european methods for it has been the experience
of german railroads that cars sent into and returned
from russia for example are often infested with
vermin these could not be exterminated by the
ordinary precautions consequently apparatus has
been devised for accomplishing for railway coaches
what has long been done for steamships

  at the potsdam shops of the prussian state rail-
ways a huge cylindrical structure has been pro-
vided into which the car is run after the heads

have been hermetically closed the interior is heated
to a temperature of from  to  degrees fahren-
heit the heat permeating into the cushions and into
all upholstered parts at the same time the air is
pumped out of the cylinder the partial vacuum
and the heat together destroying any trace of ani-
mal life germ as well as insect if a still more
thorough disinfection is desired formalin is also
introduced

  the total weight of the apparatus is about three
hundred thousand pounds and it is provided with
special inspection holes for the reading of the ther-
mometers on the inside it has been found that the
entire process of heating obtaining the partial
vacuum etc requires about two hours time it is
also claimed that the polished wood surfaces of the
cars suffer no injury from the process

 engineer millburn ran the snow blockade

but death was waiting

   j v o millburn the warmth of the
red-hot cannon-ball stove in
ij i iii illlllue the six-by-fourten office at
wh damon station after five con-
mceaaaj secutive hours in the numbing
cold of his engine-cab was the
next thing to paradise twisting at the
icicles in his gray mustache he leaned grate-
fully to the heat and his satisfaction was
supreme for because of the snow blockade
damon was now the end of the run and the
icy gale that roared outside would not get
another chance at him that night at any rate

  it had been a hard day one of the worst
in many winters on the prairies of the far
north and he and some of the oldest men
on the division pay-roll who had been called
out of their turns to make up the crew for
 had suffered intensely with the increas-
ing cruelty of the weather

  presently the station-agent a dull fellow
whose eyes made the old engineer think of
watery pools frozen to the bottom came
toward him and thrust out a yellow paper

  supposing this to be the regular order for
a lay-over until morning millburn held out
his right hand for it while with his left
he mechanically fumbled in his blouse pock-
et for the bit of pencil with which he would
scrawl his o k but as he unfolded the
sheet he read

   cut out everything but loaded coal-cars en-
   gine  at damon proceed with said coal-
   cars and snovv-plow to relief of cold sufferers
   at devils slough

 o k that er not the agent inquired
gazing into the cold sullen eyes of the
man before him the engineer felt himself
shivering as he replied wait a minute
wait

  he wanted time to think this order de-
creeing that he and his fellows must struggle

to take the throttle

in the storm against those forty-foot drifts
with onlya single engine and a plow was
absurd enough to have originated in the
mind of this loutish agent also it was
heartless enough to have emanated from the
same brutish source

  knowing however that an order does not
come from headquarters except with a very
definite purpose behind it he realized in-
stinctively that this one had been sent out
only for the purpose of silencing newspaper
agitation against the north orient rail-
road because of its failure to relieve at once
the suffering at devils slough caused by the
storm

  in the light of this reasoning he also saw
that he and his gray-bearded fellows had
been drawn for the run because being over
the age limit they would not dare refuse
lest they should be discharged and cut off
forever from railroading and a livelihood

  millburn gazed thoughtfully at his age-
worn fireman johnson and he noted too
how clearly the years had wrought havoc
with brakemen smith and clark oakerson
the conductor had only recently recovered
from an attack of pneumonia and was still
weak and thin knowing that for the sake of
their families these four men would obey the
command to go up into the freezing drifts
where beyond all doubt permanent disabili-
ty and perhaps death awaited his heart went
out to them in pity

  a desire to save them came to him and
as he racked his brain a plan slowly took
shape it meant the end of his own rail-
roading but after all his suffering would
not be nearly as poignant as theirs

   i wont take  any farther he said
finally in a quiet tone

  the mouth of the agent gaped wide but
the eyes of the four vaguely comprehending
beamed approval
beyond the drifts



  a scuffling noise came from the other end
of the room and out of the deep shadows
there a scarecrow of a man limped for-
ward his hands were like swabs of dirty
rags his nose and ears were black and peel-
ing and his cheeks had the metallic hue of
broken iron but his eyes glowed with a
light that showed a mighty purpose behind
them

   mister he said coming close to the en-
gineer  i reckon it were me that got ye into
all this trouble i mean i got ye into it
because this here agent wired em as i ast
him to i come out from devils slough
ye see them people up there is a needin
help mighty bad they haint got no coal
nor no wood nor  nothin the outsides
and the insides of all of them houses but
one up there is gone and the inside of that
one were a going when i left jist to make a
little fire for the chillun to hover over

   mister theys wimmin an babies a freez-
in up there yes sir they air a freezin
to death slow like while you an me is
warm and comfortable by this stove

  he put up his hand to shade the light
from his frost-fevered eyes and then went
on

  and me a seeing that were what made

me come i lowed that if i could make it
out a-foot other men might think they could
go in on a train

   i heerd ye say ye wouldnt go no furter
probly yeve a wife an babies of yer own
at home but mister if they wuz up at
devils slough and every time ye shet yer
eyes ye seed em a freezin there as i kin see
mine now yed simply have to go if ye
couldnt hep em all alone yed hunt as i be
huntin thinkin that people with no fault of
their own shorely caint git past help an
yed come freezin here as i come and yed
beg as im a beggin now for hep

  the engineer looked again into the faces
of his fellows and upon their straightening
forms but this time in the light of his kind-
ling sympathy for the sufferers at devils
slough the sacrifice seemed more worth
while

   we better try he said quietly  yes
we got to try

  then withdrawing the pencil from the
pocket of his blouse he scribbled his o k
upon the order

  forty minutes later with seven cars of
coal somewhere in the whirling night behind
him and with the crew and the half-frozen
man crowding his elbows in the narrow cab

o k that er not the agent inquired


the railroad mans magazine

millburn opened the throttle and  was
on her way in the forlorn hope of reaching
devils slough before it was too late the
snow-flakes danced upon his cab-panes
hemmed in by the black of the night beyond
and he watched until it became a thick white
veil that cut off even the darkness

  he swept his hands upward and sought to
climb with infinite toil he gained a few
inches but his arms stiffening as if age had
struck them he slipped slowly back to the
bottom and staggered past the wheels up the
steps into the cab

  i dont know how thick it is he said

 probly yeve a wife an babies of yer own

  he thought of his wife and children at
home and then of the women and of the
babies at devils slough he shook his head
but he opened the throttle a little wider

  after a time he felt an increasing pressure
of the snow against the plow then suddenly
the cab reeled backward and he knew they
were stuck fast in a mighty drift

  having shut down he lifted the storm-
curtain which hung between the tender and
the cab the icy whirl filled his eyes com-
pletely and the cold stung his nostrils and
his ears under the blindness and the sharp
pain he hesitated until getting his bearing
he dropped from the steps into the snow
feeling his way he floundered past the
drivers the pilot-wheels the flag-standard
and then his shoulders struck against a solid
bank in which the snow-plow was embedded

 it may be a whole lot and then again it
could be nothin at all

  reversing he backed and backed until the
distance for a good run lay between them
and the hidden wall after waiting five min-
utes for a higher boiler-pressure he opened
the throttle for the plunge ahead beneath
the wheels the rail-joints rattled then clicked
rapidly to the flying speed again the cab
reeled backward this time with a thunder-
ous hammering sound as the drivers settled
back upon the rails

  a second time he reversed and a second
time with higher pressure he hurled for-
ward again came the impact and again the
thunderous blows of iron on iron beneath
them suddenly the cab settled lower and
lower and he knew that the rail under the
toppling mogul had given way
beyond the drifts

  turning to oakerson he said we got
to have shovelers go back to damon and
ask for the section crew as the old con-
ductor obeyed he began getting out the jack-
screws and the bars

  after two hours with the help of all hands
except the fireman who stayed above to keep
the water-pipes from freezing he had the en-
gine once more level and after another two
hours he had ripped a good rail from some
distance behind the train and put it in place
of the broken one then he took out the
jacks and  was on her feet again with
her only way of retreat cut off

  at noon oakerson returned with six sec-
tion-men and an order from headquarters
that the train be immediately returned to
damon

   but when are they goin to try to make it
up to devils slough millburn asked

   i dunno the agent up there said that
the papers this morn in has it that the block-
ade is absolute and that there couldnt be
nothin done until the weather cleared so
theres no need of rushin now

  well were not goin back

  theres the order oakerson postulated

  yes but were not here because of any
order were here because we want to help
the people up at devils slough weve got
force enough to try shovelin we better try
we got to try

  to this three of the section-men and three
of the train-crew assented and with mill-
burn they took their shovels and groped past
the drivers to begin their blind toil against
the drift

  there in the whirling chaos their mittens
and their clothing became crackling mail
their breath froze in their beards and their
eyebrows were covered with ice but always
millburn urged them onward with his own
steadfast courage and obeying him they
saved themselves from freezing by desperate
shovel-play at length when the day that
more resembled night was dippearing un-
der a darker swirl he gave them leave to
rest

  while they floundered groping their way
back to the cab he went once more to the
scene of their digging and found to his grim
satisfaction that they had made perhaps a
hundred feet

  returning to the engine he worked an
hour helping the fireman to get a head of
steam and they drove forward again into the
narrow cut

  then after a supper of bacon and bread
and coffee cooked over a shovel of coals from

the fire-box he led them once more against
the drift

  six times that night he got a head of steam
and six times he drove the pilot an engine-
length ahead

  but with dawn it seemed that his efforts
must cease for the wind which all of the day
before and through the night had blown a
gale now rose to a hurricane

  undaunted however he advised the men
to keep on

   we cant go back now he said  for the
snow in the mouth of the cut is blocking us
weve got somehow to make it out to-day
because the water wont hold out for steam
another twenty-four hours and mebbe them
people up there cant hold out either weve
got to try some more

  so again he led them to the work but the
wind drove the clouds of fine snow into their
nostrils suffocating them as smoke to save
the men from strangulation he led them up
the incline to its very top where he shouted
above the storm we darent go back well
shovel here the wind will help

  but here the cold was terrific it looked
all moisture up in frost and the frost in
turn disintegrated and blew away in frozen
dust

  their ice-mail of the day before was turned
to powder now and through their coarse
clothing the wind swept as if upon their
naked bodies they dropped their shovels
and covering their heads settled down in the
snow to die

  the engineer unfalteringly stuck to his
task until his hands were helpless from the
cold and then joining his fellows he also
waited

  presently however as he felt the numb-
ness creeping deeper and deeper he was aware
of a strange sensation-that of being moved
then he heard the voice of johnson shouting
that they were being blown away and in
the next instant he knew that he was falling
and sliding down a slope suddenly his foot
touched something he groped about and
feeling a rail and a tie beneath him he lifted
up his voice in a shout that thrilled them
through and through

   its swept the cut its swept the cut

  at that moment as if some obstruction that
had been restraining it had given way the
tempest surged against them with a force that
threw them off their feet he struggled to
his knees but his hands and arms being
powerless he could not crawl again he
waited

  presently in the white murk he saw a

a iulllik cooked over a shovel of coals

black something show and disappear it
showed again and he knew it for the crusted
snow-plow at the head of the train which the
wind was pushing toward them along the
rails

   shes coinin he shouted  ketch er
as she goes by

  then rolling from between the rails he
got to his knees and when the cab-step drew
alongside he encircled it with his helpless
arms clinging on until assistance came

  inside the cab he brought life back to his
hands by the torture of the fire

   i darent wait for the snow he ex-
plained  the way is open and the waters
goin fast we got to drive her on

  then for twenty minutes he was busy with
a thawing-torch over the water-pipes and the
stiffened oil in the cups when the steam
was rising in the gage he went to the tool-box
for a heavy jack-screw with which he crawled
through the window of the cab and over the
slippery jacket to the dome

  having wedged the safety-valve so that it
could not open he wrent back

  now he said to them everything is
ready well go ahead when the steam gets
up i dont want to be advisin you what to
do but i can either make it on alone with
the devils slough man to fire or else we

cant any of us get through theres just
water enough if we dont lose a gallon ive
fixed the pop-off so it cant open and lose a
drop but if we hit another drift and the
pressures high i reckon the boiler will bust
i suppose my hands will hold out if every-
thing goes all right you fellows can do
what you want to i expect the chances are
better for your going back to damon

  the brakemen both disappeared behind the
curtain but old johnson stayed

  presently the hand of the gage slipped up
from sixtv-five to seventy-five from that to
eighty-five it jumped to a hundred then
to a hundred and twenty-five it still crept
higher until it marked two hundred and
fifty pounds-pressure

  when it had gone twenty points beyond
the safety-mark the engineer opened his
throttle

  slowly the mogul responded to the heavy
pressure in her cylinders the lank of the
trucks over the rail-joints presently became
a roar that harmonized with the blast and
the smick-smack of the flying drivers told
that their thousand-pound counter-weights
were whirling along at the rate of fifty miles
an hour

  millburn watch in hand counted the min-
utes smiling into the faces of johnson and
beyond the drifts



the man from devils slough he said to them
i dont know but what well make it after
all vve must be gettin somewhere close i
darent risk runnin by you fellows fix the
fire again and cover up with the curtain
while i open the window so i can see where
we are

  they fixed the fire and wrapped the cur-
tain about them they had snuggled under
it on the floor when they felt the rush of the
cold air sweeping from the open window
they shivered as they thought of the engi-
neer sitting in the freezing draft and often
they called out to him but on his assurance
that he was all right they would again lie
down in time they drowsed

  somewhere an hour or so later jonnson

awakened with a start the train had
stopped he flung off the curtain and run-
ning round into the gangway found the fire-
box door cold he craned his neck and saw
millburn sitting in his seat staring straight
ahead through the open window into which
no wind now roared

   millburn  he called

  but millburn did not stir

  the old fireman ran over and aroused his
companion together they climbed up be-
side the silent engineev and found him dead
there was a smile on his lips as if his sight-
less eyes found a picture of comfort in the
smoke that wreathed upward from the chim-
ney of the one remaining house in devils
slough

the goats of the u p

the union pacific railroad has discovered a
new use for billy goats and every day at half
a hundred stock-feeding stations on the line of the
big railroad system solemn goats with long white
beards act the part of judas luring unsuspecting
sheep to their doom little did the members of
the interstate commerce commission think when
they made a ruling that live stock en route from the
great western ranges to the packing-houses along
the missouri river should not be kept aboard rail-
road trains for more than twenty-eight consecutive
hours that they would be responsible for the crea-
tion of a band of goats trained to ingratiate them-
selves into the confidence of innocent little lambs
matronly ewes and stately rams and bring these
down to their death

  but such is the case and the union pacific rail-
road has a flock of goats each individual member
of which can do better work along the lines for
which it is trained than would be expected

  when the twenty-eight-hour law went into ef-
fect the union pacific found it necessary to build
big feeding yards at numerous points along its line
-in fact these yards were installed about every
twenty-five miles from end to end of the big sys-
tem during the shipping season that railroad
brings hundreds of thousands of sheep from the
great ranges of wyoming colorado utah idaho
oregon montana california and the southwestern
states to the packing-houses at omaha under

the new law it was necessary that these sheep be
unloaded fed and watered and then reloaded every
twenty-eight hours

  the railroad at first found it necessary to main-
tain a large force of men at each feeding station it
being found more economic to do this than to spend
hours and hours loading and unloading a train
this cost money and lots of it but there seemed
no means of avoiding the expense

  to-day however when a long line of stock-cars
each filled with sheep draws up at a feeding-yard
a goat is sent up the chutes and into the car among
the sheep he quickly makes the acquaintance of
the newly arrived animals and then calmly walks
out the door true to the idea of following a lead-
er the sheep fall in line and march out behind old
bill

  when ready to reload the goats are again sent
among the sheep with whom they frolic a few min-
utes and then they start for the cars followed by
the sheep

  the feeding-yards are all equipped with electric
lights so that cars may be loaded and unloaded at
night thus saving much time when a train ar-
rives at night especially are the goats necessary at
such times they enter the cars when the sheep are
lying on the floors and butt the sleeping animals
around until they are thoroughly awakened-and
then they lead them out into the feeding-pens-

small beginnings of big railroads

by arno dosch

railroads like all the other great factors of our modern civilization un-
derwent peculiar stages of evolution before reaching their present state of
development some are apt to bring smiles to many of this generation
who find it difficult to reconcile twentieth-century wonders of steam and steel
with the crude makeshifts of the past

     it is hard to imagine a great system like the pennsylvania railroad spring-
ing from the humble device of some timbers laid through the mud to form a road-
way for a farmers wagon

     how the up-to-date eagle eye would laugh if some one were to suggest that
farmers be allowed to drive their teams to town over the railroad tracks block-
ing all the freight and passenger trains yet even this was once a daily occurrence
on many big systems whose trains now run on mile-a-minnte schedules

the wild dreams of early railroad promoters whose visions grew to
realities after the long fight against all manner
of queer opposition

ohn thompson hopped out of
bed one morning with an idea it
was one hour after daybreak on a
chilly damp day in the fall of
 the cold air blew up from
between the cracks in the floor but
he did not mind since the first streak of

dawn he had been wondering how he was
going to get his potatoes and turnips to phila-
delphia over impassable roads when all at
once out of his waking dreams an idea
struck him with an uplifting force that shot
him out into the middle of the room

  pulling on his boots he waded across his

series began in the february railroad mans magaine single copies  ccnts


small beginnings of big railroads

slushy barn-yard and came to the public
road which was a quagmire all the way to
the turnpike and that was but little better
instead of scowling at the knee-deep slough
that passed for a highway however he
smiled and cherished his idea

a road of rails

  in a shed near by there were some rough-
hewn timbers and these he pulled out and
dropped in two parallel lines along the road
through the thick of the mud then he
lifted the shafts of a cart and started the
wheels over the tops of the parallel timbers
a montli later he had built a track as far
as the turnpike and drove his cart easily
down the middle the wheels following the
grooves

  the neighbors stopped to look at the
contrivance and chuckling contemptuously
whipped their plodding horses through the
mire but as john thompson beat them to
town he could afford to disregard their
sniffs in the hour of his triumph he even
ventured to predict that they would be haul-
ing their produce to town that way before
long

  he became so enamored of his idea that
he talked of nothing else and was dubbed a
crank he and his  railroad  became the
joke of the community and he was fre-
quently regarded as being mildly insane it
made him an isolated man but he did not
seem to have cared much though with his
son it was different

  the son was a small boy in school at the
time and there he was made to feel the scorn
that was shown his father

  he had spirit however and for weeks he
came home every night with swelled lips
and blacked eyes until he had licked half the
school and had been licked by the other
half finally his parents withdrew him

  listening to what his father said he
dreamed boyish day-dreams of building miles
and miles of similar highways and vindi-
cating his father as he jogged along on the
seat of a heavy cart he even imagined an
empire of such  railroads  that would con-
trol great cities annihilate distance and re-
move the curse of the country-bad roads

  it was only the day-dream of a boy with-
out playmates but it was the real beginning
of the great pennsylvania railroad with its

	miles of track its army of men its

	locomotives and  cars

john edgar thompson the inventors son

fared rather better than the rest while he

was still growing up the first excitement
over railroads swept the inhabited part of
this country and even the farmers who had
made merry over john thompsons contrap-
tion began to see something in it

  the citizens of philadelphia caught the
fever and laid several similar roads the
state also saw their advantages and estab-
lished public roads built after a similar
fashion designating them railroads

  the time soon came when all the farmers
drove up to these various tracks with their
wagons and getting them upon the rails as
best they might started for town

  every morning numbers of them could be
seen making for the city in the afternoon
the tide set the other way there were no
sidings and the whole caravan had to move
in one direction at the pace of the slowest
horse on the road but even at that the
new railroad was considered the latest and
greatest wonder in the world

  then the locomotive was invented and
horatio allen the first of the many famous
american railroad engineers brought one
over from england immediately the state
of pennsylvania became excited over it or-
dering one for its railroads

pleased the farmers

  when it arrived thetracks were improved
to support its weight and the offer was made
to haul wagons into town for a fixed fee
some of the fanners took advantage of it
others did not and the usual procedure for a
number of years was a long line of wagons
drawn by horses constantly breaking down
on the track followed by more wagons
drawn by an impatient wooden-wheeled
engine that had a bad habit of getting into
difficulties itself

  it is hard to believe it now but this kind
of railroading went on from the early thir-
ties to  when it was decided that the
state management of railroads was so unen-
terprising in the face of the great strides
made in other parts of the country that they
had better be given over into private hands

  the apology for a railroad known as the
philadelphia germantown and norristown
which had grown out of john thompsons
idea was bought from the state by the newly
organized pennsylvania railroad of which
john edgar thompson was chief engineer

  a pretty girl who enjoyed the excitement
of taking the first ride behind a locomotive
in this country is responsible for another of
the big railroad systems about the time


the railroad mans magazine

that john thompson was receiving his ear-
liest vindication she was married at her
home in the ramapo valley to the westward
of new york and with henry l pierson
her husband went on their honeymoon to
charleston south carolina they arrived
just as the first few miles of the first rail-
road in this country had been completed
and heard nothing but talk about the loco-
motive which had been imported and was
about to hazard a run

  as soon as the bride heard about the loco-
motive she set her heart upon riding in
one to her husband and all charleston it
was as if a bride in this day should insist
on making an aeroplane flight but if any-
thing is needed to prove that the young wife
was actually pretty it is that she had her
way and took the ride

  after that to travel from the ramapo
valley to new york city by carriage was
altogether too slow and she cherished the
extravagant day-dream of riding behind a
locomotive to the metropolis

  she proposed to her husband that he se-
cure her fathers backing and build the rail-
road she desired and she wheedled her
father until he began to have day-dreams
himself the enterprise was slow in mate-
rializing but in spite of failure set-backs
and constant shortage of funds she urged
them on until twenty years later she was
able to realize her dream and rode from
new york to the great lakes within a day
over the erie railroad

a railroad that paid

  long before this historic event took place
buffalo had been reached by the new york
central a corporation evolved from the day-
dream that railroads could be made to pay
big dividends

  like most of the roads of the early forties
it came out of the delirium of railroad
intoxication in which the country was in-
dulging but that it developed so rapidly into
a connected railroad out of seven small mis-
erable disconnected links was due to the
efficiency of the syracuse and utica railroad
which paid handsomely from the start at-
tracting the attention of the first of the
financiers who saw the value in combination

  all the towns from albany to buffalo had
become connected in a haphazard way by
rail but the individual companies were all
so poor that they could not have secured
capital if it had not been for one road that
ran on schedule making ten to twelve miles

an hour crowded with excursionists even
as early as  before the other six con-
necting links had been built the syracuse
and utica had been a paying institution the
first of the successful railroad ventures
from a financial point of view

  it had but fifty miles of track half a
dozen engines and less than thirty cars but
it served as a nucleus for the vanderbilt
system with  miles of track  en-
gines and  cars

horses versus locomotives

  the beginnings of the baltimore and ohio
is an even more engaging story what made
the erie and the new york central possible
was that the interior needed an outlet to the

sea

  the same situation confronted the coun-
try to the westward of baltimore only in-
stead of the country worrying about it balti-
more took the burden on itself it fostered a
plan of laying a railroad across the alle-
ghanies to the headwaters of the ohio and
into the western country which was just be-
ginning to receive its first settlers

  new york was laughing at a ridiculous
individual who tried to get backing for a
railroad south of the great lakes to connect
with the navigable waters of the mississippi
and was inclined to regard baltimores
dreams as scarcely less ludicrous these
dreams would have come to little if the
original plan had been adhered to

  the locomotive had been tried out at
charleston and even had been run at night
by the light of a pine-knot on a flat car in
front but baltimore was skeptical and was
quite certain that horses would be sufficient

  it is no wonder however that they fought
shy of engines in spite of a few successful
trials four of the best-known english en-
gineers had just held a conference in lon-
don at which they decided that the locomo-
tive was impracticable as an alternative
they urged stationary engines much like the
present donkey-engines with a long rope at-
tached to a revolving drum a scheme some-
thing like the cable road

  any mine in the country to-day has a
tramway superior to this first attempt of
the baltimore and ohio it was nothing
more than a pair of wooden rails for wagons
with grooved wheels to be pulled across the
country by horses the cars held but a few
bushels and it was really about as cheap to
use the highway but baltimore took more
pride in that piece of track then than it

  ever has since although it has stretched
  out until it is now  miles long and
  has in its service  cars and 
  engines

     but as if to make up for its original lack
  of faith in the powers of the locomotive
  this road was the first seventy-five years
  later to see the value of the mallet com-
  pound locomotives and increase its freight-
  hauling capacity by fifty per cent

a track that disappeared

    the wabash got its start because in the
  winter of - the farmers of central
  illinois needed runners for their sleighs
  and wood for their fires

    the first railroad agitation had swept
  through illinois several years before and out
  of a hundred schemes for railroad building
  only one had materialized it was called
  the northern cross and was built by the
  state on the assumption that it was going
  to settle and civilize illinois it was a road
  of some pretentions when built but served
  no purpose whatsoever

    it began nowhere and ended nowhere it
  opened no communication to the outside
  world and could do no greater service than
  haul farm crops to miserable hamlets that
  had no need of them in those days chi-
  cago was only a small town and the rest
  of the state just missed being a wilderness

    nevertheless the northern cross had been
  built the whole state had been taxed far
  beyond its possibilities to pay for it and
  an attempt was made to get some good out
  of the money

    a locomotive was imported and it was
  run for several summers then came the
  winter of - when the strap irons
  laid along the wooden rails began to dis-
  appear making the seasoned timbers beneath
  an irresistible temptation to the fire-wood
  hunters

    in the spring there was no longer any
  track and the state officials throwing up
  their hands in despair put the northern
  cross to the block

    even at this dark moment the dawn of
  the great railroad geniuses who built up the
  country was at hand and the first of these-
  n h ridgely of springfield illinois-was
  on hand to bid  for what remained of
   the northern cross this was a ridiculous
  price as all that was left was the right-of-
  way however this was all that ridgely
  needed to serve his purpose

to the eastward two railroads which

sold sfoclc under the ambitious titles of the
toledo and illinois and the lake erie
wabash and st louis had built a few
miles of track what they needed to breathe
enthusiasm into prospective stockholders was
a few miles of road-bed in illinois so that
they could publish a prospectus stating that
they were building in three states at once it
sounded well and it was even easier to get
money out of peoples pockets then than now
so they merged the three roads into one it
was named the wabash

  the rock island planned to go to the
pacific coast and was the first of the pro-
posed transcontinental railroads to get a real
start

  this was never accomplished but if the
attempt had been for a lesser goal it might
never have had two terminals

  the rock island was only one out of
 similar projects to connect chicago with
the mississippi only a few of the others
even got a start and most of them began
and ended in small stretches of isolated
track which were finally torn up by the
fanners

  the rock island however proved so suc-
cessful in its limited field that its directors
scoffed at the wild plans of its first pro-
moters and when major-general grenville
m dodge went before them a few years later
to secure their support in an extension of
the rock island to the pacific they refused
to listen

would not heed promoters

  in his book  how we built the union
pacific he says in telling of this meeting
to which he went fired with enthusiasm

  the secretary of the company read my
report but before he was half through
nearly every person had left the room

  with great self-restraint general dodge
adds

   i could see that there was a lack of
faith and even interest in the matter one
of the directors said in the outer room that he
did not see why they should lie asked to hear
such nonsense

  so the rock island missed its chance of
becoming the first transcontinental railroad

  contemporaneous with it and based on a
scheme hardly less airy in its way than the
purposes of the original rock island pro-
moters was the inception of the great chi-
cago and northwestern

  in the year  there were two towns
in northern illinois which were striving for


the railroad mans magazine

leadership that one would become a great
city every one was convinced of the two
chicago had the best start with  in-
habitants but almost due west within a
stones throw of the mississippi was ga-
lena boosted by real-estate boomers who
were always in chicago selling galena town
lots

a real-estate railroad

  to help along their scheme they went to
the illinois legislature and received a char-
ter for the chicago and galena railroad

then with a great flourish and much sell-
ing of lots they set about surveying a rail-
road and ran ten miles out of chicago

  it was not necessary to go farther the
people in chicago would buy the lots on
that but shortly interest began to flag so
they did the next most conspicuous thing
laid tracks on dearborn street

  in those days the favorite -way to build
railroads was to elevate them on timbers and
so escape the unevenness of the country
rather than attack the ground with scrapers
and reduce it all to one level so these busy
promoters constructed an elevated track
down the center of dearborn street not that
there was any necessity for it dearborn
street being as level as the floor but because
it made more of a show

  with that grand spectacle to conjure with
the sale of galena lots was so easy that the
promoters soon rid themselves of all their
holdings and having no further use for the
incipient railroad left it as it stood

  for eleven years until s it blocked
the main street of the town-a nuisance and
an eyesore

  just as the wabash and the rock island
came out of nothing but frenzied minds in-
to great railroad systems the chicago and
galena was actually surveyed its whole
length and work was begun which has not
stopped yet

  by this time a number of small towns
had sprung up northwest of chicago and
it was thought best to take them in the
route from chicago to galena was there-
fore in the shape of an interrogation point
as work progressed galena and the country
to the westward was rather neglected with
the result that while the chicago and north-
western has spread itself over the whole of
the territory for which it was named to
go to galena over it even to this day re-
quires a roundabout journey over the inter-
rogation-point route

  there had been a lot of wonder and specu-
lation about a pacific railroad even before
the rock island got started that way and
the dreams grew in number until every town
east of the rocky mountains which had
more than a dozen houses regarded itself as
the eastern terminus of the proposed pacific
railroad

  in the same way each of the great trans-
continental lines afterward built took form
first in the mind of some dreamer

  josiah ierham appeared in new york in
 his shrewd face glowing with yankee
enthusiasm and announced that he was
about to sell a million shares of stock in the
peoples pacific railroad for which he was
about to get a charter

  if a man of josiah perhams type under-
took to-day to sell a million shares in an
airship line to london urging people to buy
for patriotic motives he would not be
treated with more contempt than the solid
business men of new york accorded josiah
perham moreover he would probably be
denied the use of the mails and if he pur-
sued congressmen and made the life of the
president miserable for fourteen years in his
desire to receive a government charter he
would be barred from washington

  what josiah perham thought of doing
seemed no less mad national enthusiasm
was bubbling in those days a little more
violently than at present but the project was
no less chimerical to financiers

  perham was rich for his time having
made a fortune arranging excursions on the
early railroads which he spent before he
was able to secure a charter

  so great wras his enthusiasm however
that he even got the foremost congressmen
of his time to speak for his project finally
in  after several other pacific roads
had been chartered he secured the name of
abraham lincoln to a paper that made his
plan possible

  the charter once launched was too valu-
able to be allowed to die and although per-
ham himself did not live to see his dream
realized the peoples pacific railroad finally
evolved into the northern pacific and was
built under that name

the origin of the missouri pacific

  but even while perham was making his
first attempt to secure a charter the city of
st louis with  inhabitants started a
railroad westward under the name of the
missouri pacific it had the far goal in
small beginnings of big railroads



view and seemed for the time to have the
best chance of reaching it but it was many
years before it touched the rocky mountains

   still that line stretching out over the prai-
ries was destined to become one of the
largest railroads in the country with 
miles of track more than  engines
and  cars

   it was one out of hundreds there was at
least one transcontinental railroad planned
for each parallel of latitude but less than
half a dozen of them had behind them
dreamers who could make their dreams come
true among them was abraham lincoln

  it has only recently become known that
lincoln belonged among the empire builders
and decided the fate of the first transconti-
nental railroad with the cities that have
grown up along its tracks a chance meet-
ing between lincoln and general dodge
brought this about in the book recently
published and quoted herein general dodge
shows how lincoln first pictured the rails
laid over the emigrant trail and afterward
decided that route for the union pacific

   back of it is a little history when the
rock island gave up its pacific projects
it lost the services of its most daring engi-
neer peter a dey he decided to go farther
on his own account and crossing the mis-
sissippi into iowa began the survey of the
mississippi and missouri railroad logic-
ally that was the beginning of the union
pacific although it afterward became part
of the rock island with dey was dodge

the first transcontinental line

   all sorts of surveys for railroads to the
pacific had been made but dey and dodge
had an idea that the best one lay due west
of where they were working dodge was the
more foot-loose of the two and he went for-
ward to investigate crossing the missouri
river at council bluffs in  to the spot
where omaha then an indian camp now
stands

  dodge crossed at that point and deter-
mined the future of omaha and the route
of the union pacific dodge felt that he
was making history and he became so anx-
ious to reach the platte to see whether it
was really the feasible route he believed it
to be that he left his escort and struck out
across the prairie by himself into what was
then a hostile indian country afterward
the union pacific was laid almost in his
ponys tracks

during the six or eight years that dodge

had made his headquarters at council bluffs
he worked farther and farther west until he
had mapped out a route through the rocky
mountains

  returning in  from an expedition
he was sitting on the steps of the old pacific
house in council bluffs when he was ap-
proached by a tall kindly stranger who
introduced himself as a lawyer from illinois

  the stranger asked several questions about
the western country and dodge answered
until he had imparted all the information it
had taken him years to get but he thought
nothing of it at the time as he was accus-
tomed to explaining the prairie country to
strangers and the matter would never have
been recalled had it not been tor an incident
which occurred in the midst of the civil
war four years later

lincoln maps the route

  dodge the engineer had become general
dodge and was in command of a district in
mississippi when one day he received a
message from general grant to proceed at
once to washington and report to president
lincoln

  in the heat of war general dodge had done
a number of things that he feared might not
look well from the presidents point of view
and he anticipated trouble wondering all
the way what was in store for him lie had
no inkling of the purpose of the journey until
he arrived then as he entered the white
house he was greeted cordially by the illi-
nois lawyer with whom he had been so
friendly and confidential

  the former conversation was brought up
immediately the president telling general
dodge that it was responsible for the present
meeting forgetting for the moment the cares
of war lincolns face lighted with enthusi-
asm and he asked to be taken once more-
on a mental tour-over the prairie country
west of the missouri then he told general
dodge that the bill for the construction of
the union pacific had passed congress and
it was his duty to determine the route so far
as it concerned the eastern terminus

   several towns on the missouri river
writes general dodge were competing for
the terminus but mr lincoln practically
settled the question in favor of the location i
recommended

  that location was omaha only a few years
previously the indian camp from which
dodge turned his ponys nose westward

the union pacific was so named because


the railroad mans magazine

it was to bind the union together but it
realized its purpose the sooner on account of
the central pacific which met it half way
the work of another dreamer-theodore d
judah

  of all the prairie and mountain country
no part lured the early voyagers more than
the fascinating region southwest of kansas-
past the bloody point of rocks over the santa
fe trail into what was then known as the
great american desert

visions of the santa fe

  even to-day in spite of the fact that it is
crisscrossed with railroad tracks it has the
same strong appeal to the imagination

  the man most interested in its possibilities
in those days was colonel cyrus k holli-
day one of the founders of topeka and a
kansas pioneer at one time his cabin was
the farthest west

  standing in his cabin-door -he would look
down the broad santa fe trail and day by
day it grew upon him that there was a route
for a railroad the soil of kansas had hardly
been turned and buffaloes still roamed over
it but there was no stopping colonel holli-
day and his day-dream one day he took a
last look from his cabin-door and started
east to get money

  nine years he talked and planned before
any one would listen to him the union pa-
cific and central pacific which had been
visions when he began were almost completed
before he received the slightest attention

  then in  he found men who had the
courage to build the first thousand miles but
it was many years after before the whole
of his dream was realized and the santa fe
circled through the mesas to california

  with the union pacific across the central
rockies the santa fe circling from the south
and the north pacific in the middle north
another of the great transportation systems
soon to be brought to life was the railroad of
the far northwest

  before any of the other roads had taken
form even when josiah perham was just be-
ginning to pave the way for the northern
pacific james j hill went into the north-
west at the time there were only six thou-
sand white people in minnesota

  when he had been there only a few years
the st paul and pacific destined to become
the great northern was projected but did
nothing to make itself worthy of the name
until twenty-five years later when he found
that it was ripe to build even in the fifties

he had his vision of empire and though he
had to wait he is the only one of all the dream-
ers who made his dream come true from be-
ginning to end

  when james j hill first turned his horse
westward from chicago to the prairie grass
the country was in need of cruder forms of
transportation than railroads for more than
twenty years his time was absorbed in getting
supplies as quickly as possible to settlers who
sent out their farm produce in an ever-in-
creasing volume

  sledges carts and steamers that could
travel in the shallowest water served his pur-
pose then but his thoughts were still far afield
and as soon as the settlers began to push into
the interior far enough to justify it he wanted
a railroad

  his interests had grown into the north
along the red river when in  it came
to him that his earliest dreams of an empire
in the west were ready for realization

   selling out all his other interests he cen-
tered his attention on the st paul and pacific
and secretly surveyed a route to the missouri
long before work had progressed that far
however his schemes had carried him across
the dakotas to montana and beyond and be-
fore any one realized what he was up to he
was rushing his tracks up the first stretch to
the mountains

a fight against odds

  when it was learned that he had nothing
less in view than another transcontinental
railroad every hand was turned against him
stockholders rebelled other railroad men
scoffed at his wild dream and for a time
even his right-of-way was blocked by the gov-
ernment but he shook his fist in the faces
of the new york bankers who tried to inter-
fere and told the stockholders that he would
not stop until the board of directors made him
that could not happen before the next annual
meeting

  it was a boast the directors also turned
on him

  then came the crucial moment of his life
either his plan would tumble about his ears
leaving his dream forever unrealized or it
would receive an impetus that would carry
it through like a whirlwind

  taking the meeting of the board by storm
he locked the door behind him and did not
permit a man to leave until by the power of
his personality and the logic of his argument
he had made the board see the situation with
his own eyes

synopsis of previous chapters

vincent wilson having risen from the apprentice shop to mechanical superintendent of the
mainland system has discovered what he believes to be a leak in the affairs of the company
and criticizes to president harvey jones the action of the board of directors on voting  for
certain purchases wilson visits a former employee of the mainland system doc ferguson who
imparts to him the information that kaintuck a former friend of both had developed leprosy and been
sent to the leper settlement at molokai kaintuck was betrothed to a beautiful girl meriel
planquette whose address wilson is very desirous of obtaining from doc doc refuses to give
this information unless wilson pays him  meriel planquette after kaintuck had been sent
to the leper settlement married john toylmore formerly new york representative of the mainland
system who shortly after their marriage had been killed in an automobile accident she now has
many suitors among them bertrand clivers an elderly broker and jimmie winters young
and impetuous she loves the latter and promises to marry him but is won over at the
very last moment by clivers and leaves with him for europe instead of going to europe however
mr and mrs clivers register at the continental hotel on fifth avenue where winters discovers them
he is mad with jealousy andhatred for clivers and forces his presence on meriel as she enters the
hotel alone he reproaches her and threatens her husband he overhears two men in conversation
in the hotel lobby and as they let fall the word clivers he determines to know more about them one
of them who proves to be vincent wilson is stopping at the hotel and to him winters sends up his
card he is received and explains the reason of his intrusion wilson is eager to hear his story and
in turn tells of his interest in the clivers winters is persuaded to introduce wilson to meriel as
she is lunching alone her husband having left for louisville to be away a few days wilson is also
anxious to meet clivers and arranges with winters and tom tracie a detective to be in the hotel lobby
on sunday evening at the hour clivers is expected to return on his arrival he is recognized by
wilson as stephen blander however it is not in wilsons plan to let clivers know he has been discov-
ered and so he greets him by his real name blander and seemingly takes it for granted that he is in
new york on a visit blander is suspicious of wilson but can find no foundation for his suspicion
until he ascertains that he wilson is stopping at the continental and this convinces him that he is
being spied upon and he determines to get wilson out of the way by fair means or foul the fear of
discovery however is so great that an attack of apoplexy seizes him and he is confincd to his room for
several days in the meantime wilson has returned to louisville leaving instructions with the de-
tective to keep blander under surveillance and relates to president harvey jones all that has trans-
pired blander declares that wilson must be put out of the way

a journey down-town

incent wilson must
pay for this i cannot
afford to lose

    these were the first
 words on blanders lips
 as he arose the next morning

 even as he dressed and took the spare
 breakfast that he had sent up to his room he
 kept repeating

 rr

   get wilson out of the way get wilson
out of the way 

  he wanted to burn the desire into his
mind he wanted to fix it so steadfastly on
his purpose that he would not quail at the
last moment

   get wilson out of the way 

  about half past ten oclock he called to his
wife and told her that he was going down
town

   and my dear he added  i may have
to run over to philadelphia for a day to
look over some bonds i may stay one day or

began in the may railroad mans magazine single copies  cents




the railroad mans magazine

two days-i dont know in any event make
yourself perfectly happy take all the motor
rides you want go to all of the theaters and if
you are lonesome call up some of your
friends

  do you have to be gone long asked
meriel half interestedly

   i cant say my dear i hope to close up
a lot of my affairs soon so that we can take
a long trip and be together for more than a
week at a time you see what it is to be
married to a financier who must fight like a
tiger for his interests now deary dont be
lonesome if you want any money the hotel
will advance you any amount he moved
toward the door

  the wife kissed him unfeelingly he waved
a hearty good-by and the door closed be-
tween them

  blander left the hotel unobserved the
lobby was crowded at the time the busy
clerks did not see his hasty exit nor did de-
tective tracie who had been keeping a silent
watch on the main floor as a matter of pre-
caution

  blander hailed a taxi-cab and was driven
to the ferry station at the foot of cortlandt
street ostensibly to take a jersey ferry there
he dismissed the cab and hurried into the
ferry-house-just as a bluff

   he looked out to see if the taxi driver were
waiting for another fare but to his satisfac-
tion he had departed

  blander didnt want to take any chances
the game that he had begun to play was a
desperate one millionaires and other men
whose names are familiar to the inner circles
of wall street and other places where the
great industrial affairs of the country are
discussed do not-as a rule-go about plan-
ning the murder of a fellow-being

  when he left the ferry-station he walked
briskly across the city-through city hall
park by park row-the home of the great
new york newspapers-to the entrance to
brooklyn bridge and onto the bowery

  he had gone along that thoroughfare about
three blocks when he started on an eastern
tangent to a certain tenement just beyond the
cherry hill district and not far from the
north river

  in this tenement lived brown taber
so-called because of the peculiar hue of his
brown hair and eyes and the sallowness of
his complexion the three mingled in such
a noticeable coloring that from his boyhood
he had been known as  brown  taber

  once when he was called before a judge
and jury for placing several and sundry

pieces of lead in the body of a policeman
who was trying to  take him in he said that
it was so long since he had heard his first
name he was doubtful if he knew just what
it was

  he was forty-eight years old-big burly
and strong by trade he was a teamster-
but for some reason or other he seldom plied
his trade his employers soon found him out
and they wouldnt take chances with a man
who had been publicly declared a thug and
who had a prison record as well on many
occasions he had been a  front-page feature 
in the newspapers he lived with his old
mother-a white-haired gentle soul who
was slowly going to her grave because of her
sons wickedness but his love for her was
the most notable topic of  the block as the
tenement in which they lived was called 

  on more than one occasion it had saved
 brown  from jail it was the old mothers
hope and prayer to reform her son ever
since he had come home from sing sing she
had pleaded with bim to stay in the right
path-at least so long as she lived-and with
the aid of father flynn whose untiring devo-
tion to the sinning souls of his parish do-
minion was heroic she had partly succeeded

   brownie -that was her pet name for
him- brownie was always a good boy
she would say through her tears until the
father died-and then i could not hold him

  but  brown  had promised to reform
he had given his old mother his word that
he would be good with some little aid from
father flynn coupled to the few hundred
dollars which in former years she had saved
from her husbands earnings they would go
to some new town in the west and begin anew

  poor little woman her mothers heart beat
with youthful joy at the thought of this she
wanted her boy to have a clean chance once
away from evil associates she could watch
over him-for even though he was a grown
man a thug and a prison bird he was her
own flesh and blood

  such is the love of a mother

chapter xiv
the interview with  brown

hp here was a knock on the door of the
taber tenement  brown  and his
mother were sitting in their little living room
they looked at each other queerly

  the knocking was new and strange to them
they knew the quiet friendly rapping of
father flynn they could tell the different
president of the line



announcements of the few friends that
dropped in now and then-but there was a
stranger at the door

  the knocking was repeated several times
and each time in the most sudden and sharp
manner as if the visitor wanted to be admitted
without delay

   i wonder who that can be   said the old
mother

  dunno replied taber sounds like the
knock of the last copper who come to pinch
me

    better go and see  brownie 

  the man obeyed he opened the door
cautiously outside stood the heavy-built
well-groomed form of stephen blander

  it was unusual to see so hefty a swell in
such a place as an east-side tenement but
blander showed by his manner that he had
no misgivings for being there it was evident
that he was not looking for a  lost-strayed-
or-stolen  son

   is this mr taber  he asked as politely
as if he had been in his own club

   yes sir replied  brown

   i should like to see you on a little matter
of business said blander

   brown  taber opened the door a little
wider but as blander caught sight of the old
mother he showed by his quick-changing
countenance that he did not want a tbird
party present to hear what he had to say

   come in said  brown

  thank you er- stuttered blander
 but-if it is all the same to you-that is
the nature of my business is such that-i
should like to see you alone

   oh i see said  brown

  you know of some place where i can
talk to you alone   blander put the ques-
tion very quietly

   brown  did not say anything he simply
reached to the little rack on the wall for his
hat and coat and blander stepped back into
the hall

  mrs taber did not like the whole proceed-
ing nor did it please her to see her son put
on his hat and coat and start off with a
mysterious stranger

  she arose and went up to him with more
tenderness than usual she put her small hands
up to his great face and patted him as if he
were an unruly baby

   where are you going  brownie    she
asked

   down to joe smiths-in the back room
he answered

   oh  brownie i hate to have you go
there why must you  

    well id better see what this guy wants-
and he wants to see me alone

    be careful my boy be careful dont let
him lead you into anything-not even for any
sum of money

   the old mothers eyes filled with tears she
looked into the eyes of her son and repeated
not for any sum of money 

  all right mother i promise

    brown  stooped over and kissed the little
woman he put his arm around her and he
could feel her body trembling it was clear
that she foreboded that something had sud-
denly come into their lives to spoil her plan

  oh women are so keen in such moments as
this what gives them their intuition-we
men often wonder-and well we may for they
possess it just as certain as there is a sun and
moon

  dont worry mother i know where i
stand  brown  added by way of assurance

  he joined blander in the hallway the
little mother went into her bedroom took the
small crucifix from its place on the mantel
and holding it before her knelt by her
humble bed and prayed as she had never
prayed before

 

chapter xv

at joe smiths

the tabers lived on the sixth and top
floor of die tenement the journey up
and down stairs was a long one and die stairs
were narrow

  blander led the way down and taber fol-
lowed neither spoke until the street was
reached blander stepped over to the curb
looked cautiously about him and then said
taber can i see you alone somewhere
near here i have a proposition to make to
you-a business proposition

   we can go down to the corner to joe
smiths replied taber its a saloon
there are some rooms in the back and we
wont be disturbed

are you quite sure it is quiet-that is-
er-i mean to say we will not be disturbed  
 its die best place i know  brown 
answered we can get in a corner and no-
body will hear us

    good  ejaculated the financier

  the two started off joe smiths was just
around the corner-about a block and a half
away neither man spoke a word and
blander tried to keep just behind taber so
as the people in the street would not think
that diey were acquainted


the railroad mans magazine

  but blander with his fifth avenue dress
and manners was a queer sight in those parts
his kind seldom appeared in the precincts of
cherry hill except when they went a slum-
ming and then they were usually hailed with
such a volley of ancient eggs dead cats and
tin missies-which the rising generation of
he hill kept for that particular purpose-they
seldom made a second visit

  blander knew that he was being observed
he might be taken for a landlord he thought
but little did he know that landlords are the
most unpopular of all human beings in that
section of the metropolis or he might be a
philanthropist-

  just as he was deciding which he would be
taber turned into joe smiths blander was
a little surprised and hesitated at the door
but this was no time to waver he mustered
up courage and the man who had been used
to the cafes of rich clubs and gay hotels
found himself inside the most ill-smelling
joint in all new york

  the fumes of stale beer and whisky
almost suffocated him the hangers-on-
reeking with bad liquor inside and the filth
of idleness outside-looked up at him and
one or two even began to jeer

  joe smith was behind the bar he saw
taber speak to blander and point to a room
in the rear of the place and he knew that
something good was going to happen

  that was why he yelled  shut up you
four-flusher or ill throw you out to one
half-drunk individual who had spent his last
cent in the place the night before and who had
suggested that the newcomer be asked  to
buy

  taber pulled up a chair to a table motioned
blander to be seated and then took a chair
himself

  what will you have asked blander
knowing that it would be necessary to patron-
ize the place

   beer replied taber

   so will i said blander

   two up  called taber through the door
presently joe smith came in with the drinks
on a tray and he took the financiers quarter
and his request to keep the change with un-
due civility as he went out he closed the
door

   anyting yez wants jess call  brownie 
he said

  the room was small and badly lighted it
was stuffy and unclean blander wished he
were in some other place but his mission was
as unclean as his surroundings and perhaps
it was all for the best

   brown  gulped his beer blander sipped
his then blander cleared his throat gave
the vest that covered his portly front a tug
and leaning over toward the other man said
in a low but clear voice

  taber i have come to you to ask you to do
a job for me

  somewhere he had read that putting a man
to death for money was frequently referred to
as a  job  by the initiated

  it is a job he went on that requires
the nerve of just such a man as you and i
understand that you are just the man to
carry it out i have read all about you-
and know you by-er--reputation so i feel
safe in-er-talking to you

   before going any further i may tell you
that its successful-er-carrying out will
mean a large sum of money-er-to the man
who does it

  what kind of a job is it asked
 brown

  blander looked nervously at the door fie
cleared his throat again and continued
speaking very softly

  for some time taber a certain man has
been bothering me-that is he has been try-
ing to make it appear that i-er-that i am
-that is somewhat involved in certain mon-
ey matters of course it is only a supposi-
tion of his-jealousy-thats it-business
jealousy he wants to make it appear that i
am-involved-that i have not carried on
my affairs-my money affairs-

  blander was floundering hopelessly taber
was looking at him straight and true with-
out a motion

  flis sharp brown eyes were penetrating the
financier his face was fixed and sober it
was very evident that he would be obliged to
tell blanders story for him

   coming down to cases said taber
youve got away with some dough that
dont belong to you and some feller has
squealed

  that was what blander wanted to say but
couldnt fie looked at taber with blanched
face he wondered how taber could have
guessed it

  an you want to make me a proposition
to  croak  the guy what knows that you stole
the coin aint that it

  brown was not a man to mince mat-
ters he was for coming straight to the issue
without any diplomatic frills or unnecessary
frippery his frankness took blanders
breath away for the moment

  no that is-well-i must admit it is
something like it
president of the line



  he took his handkerchief and wiped the
heavy beads of perspiration from his brow
and neck he had showed his hand-now he
must play the game to the limit

   yes that is something-like what i
would want you to do hes not-a-big
man went on blander believing that the
victims size might whet the homicides ap-
petite

  neither man spoke for a moment the prop-
osition had been made taber had brought it
to a head quickly and now he understood

  the man before him was evidently a rich
man and would pay the price-whatever it
was he was in a desperate situation or he
would not have come with such a proposition
in his mind but he would pay he would
pay-he was the kind who would pay

  and what was one more notch in tabers
gun he thought of the little mother and
the promise he could see her tears and feel
her caress and her soft and earnest words
were ringing in his ears-but this man
would pay-he would pay more than the
job was worth and the man who was brave
enough to do the dirty deed would be rich
and secure for life

  these and other thoughts ran through the
brain of  brown  taber

  he could see himself and his mother liv-
ing in luxury far from new york-and too
he could see the cold gray walls and the
barred window of degradation he could
picture himself and his old mother with
every comfort that the world could afford
and too he could taste the monotonous
bread and water of the law-breaker

  anyhow he asked  how much will you
give  

  five thousand dollars said blander

  it isnt enough replied taber with
businesslike promptness

  five thousand dollars repeated blan-
der slowly with emphasis on the last word
why my man that will be in cold cash 

   cold-cash on your part and cold blood
on mine said taber

   what will you take   asked blander
he was showing signs of nervousness it
was evident that he did not want to dick-
er long

  what will you give asked taber
its worth a lot to you youre the seller
and im the buyer you should know what
its worth to you

   suppose that we figure on-say-seventy
hundred said blander

  ill have to think it over said taber
 ill see you to-morrow

    i wish that we could arrive at some defi-
nite arrangement to-day

  you have to give me till to-morrow
replied taber  its too ticklish a job look
what stares me in the face-if i get caught
 i am not oblivious to your nervousness
in a transaction of this kind blander re-
marked but if you could facilitate matters
by communicating with mesaythis evening
well make it to-night said taber
 ill meet you here at eight

    suppose we say at the corner at eight
blander answered  i should not like to
come here without you

  whats your name asked taber as
the man started to go

  my name said blander hesitating
 i will tell you that to-night-if you will
excuse me until then

  he held out his hand which taber took
i just want to add continued blander
still holding tabers hand that i will pay
four thousand dollars on closing the agree-
ment-that is before any action is taken
and thebalance immediately on-er-on-
 on receiving the news that the guy is
dead said brown taber with his cus-
tomary method of coming to the point

chapter xvi

nakes in the grass

til lander and taber walked into the
-- street a curious crowd had gathered
while they were inside the saloon for the
appearance of such a fine-looking gentleman
as blander in such a region-especially
when he had been closeted in the back room
of a notorious saloon with a man who was
known as one of the most desperate char-
acters-was a matter for more than ordinary
notice

  blander eyed the crowd curiously but
those in the waiting throng knew that when
brown taber curled his lower lip and
said  chase yourselves  and waved his
hand in derision they were to disperse

  blander hurried on and was soon lost in
the passing crowd he made his way quick-
ly from the bowery to that part of the city
where men of his apparent kind walked and
talked

  taber walked around the square-and
thought he didnt want to go home until
he had thought it all over-until he had
sifted it over and over and over again in
his mind until he had looked at it from
every conceivable angle


the railroad mans magazine

  it was a desperate step to take but four
thousand dollars would be handed to him
when the agreement was made and the bal-
ance when the trick was turned

  it was a lot of money it would keep him
from harm for a mighty long time it would
bring to his mother-

  but then he didnt want to think of her
it would not be difficult to turn the trick
merely lure the guy down to the wharf on
some pretext or other some night when it
was very dark a quick sharp blow on the
head-the body dropped into the waiting
boat below-he would enter it so stealthily-
then he would row out into the river-a
weight would be tied to the feet-and it
would be finished

  thus he reasoned as he walked again he
found himself in the vicinity of jge smiths
before going home he would go in and have
one more drink-just one to sort of warm
the cockles of his heart

  joe was behind his busy bar drawing beer
for a quartet of sailors who had just arrived
on a south american bark and were cutting
loose with their money when he had served
them he turned to  brown  with a pleasant
smile and invited him to have a drink on
the house

  whowas your friend to-day brown
asked smith

   oh nobody in particular

  want you to pull off a little job

  im not saying anything joe

  well you and a rich guy like that dont
sit in a room over one glass of suds for an
hour without somethin happening did
you roll him  

  no nothin like that

   cant you let me know  aint i goin
to be in on it you know if anythin is
pulled off in my  joint  im entitled to some
of the winnings

   there was nothing pulled off i tell
you said brown it was only a busi-
ness matter

  not gettin chesty eh

  tabers first impulse was to let the man
behind the bar have a piece of his mind and
his fist as well that was his mode of
settling an insult but he was to bring bland-
er there that night and he did not want to
get into smiths bad graces-

  no i aint getting chesty joe i simply
cant tell you anything about this-not now
that seemed to satisfy smith so taber
swallowed his drink and started home he
climbed the long narrow stairs of his tene-
ment more slowly than ever before with

each step he weighed the problem in his
mind with each step he wondered just what
he would say to the little woman who waited
for him and who had been wondering what
kept him so long he stood on the threshold
of the door for a moment put his hand on
the knob and mustering up all his courage
entered

  the little mother was sitting with father
flynn the good man was comforting her

  as soon as her son entered she arose and
held out her arms to him

  oh brownie she cried im so glad
that you have come back i was afraid
that something had happened to you and i
sent for father flynn so he could advise
me

  the priest held out his hand and taber
took it and smiled

   im glad you are here my boy tell me
is there anything wrong

  nothing father he replied a man
called to see me and we went out to trans-
act our business

   all right replied the priest  now be
good to the little mother and if you want
me be sure to send for me

  the priest departed and taber sat rather
sullenly by the window his mother came
over to him put her ami around him and
sat on the arm of his chair

  brownie she whispered what is it
all about what did the man want
nothing mother-it was nothing dont
ask me

  she knew he was lying she knew that
whenever he was in trouble or planning some
miserable crime his whole manner changed
he became a brooding sullen disagreeable
sodden thing and all these elements showed
plainly now

   brownie she said again more tenderly
than before  i am your mother you prom-
ised me that you are going to be good
something came into your life to-day that
makes you want to change tell me tell me
all about it tell me everything-the entire
truth

  theres nothing to tell mother

   there is my boy and worst of all
you are not truthful about it come my dear
my boy my child tell me

  she stood up and tears came into her eyes
she put her hand-up to her face to brush
them away he heard her sob and he looked
up all the mother instinct went out to him
the vibrant force of her nature played in
harmony with his soul and he said
mother sit down i will tell you
president of the line



  she resumed her seat but her heart was
heavy she knew that if he had made up
his mind he would be hard to move he
took her hand in his and held it tightly for
a moment then said

   did you notice that man who called here
to-day well he wants me to kill a man
my child dont dont think of such a
thing what did you tell him

   i told him nothing but there is a lot
of money in it mother four thousand dol-
lars cash when the agreement is made and
the balance thirty-five hundred dollars
when the trick is turned think of that-
no no she screamed such a thing
must not be you must tell me you wont
think of me you would kill me remem-
ber that  brownie you would kill me 
then she came close to him and put her
arms around him and pleaded with him as
never before her poor frail body shook
with emotion and her tears fell hot on his
face her words came quick then faltered
and at length he could stand it no longer
he took her in his arms and said

  mother leave this to me

   brownie she said in one last effort  i
will send for die police and have you arrest-
ed if you do not promise me at once and
furthermore if you leave this hbuse to-night
ill call in the officers there is nothing i
wont do  brownie to prevent this so if
you value your life and mine you can act
now but you shall not leave this house to-
night unless it is over my dead body

  small and weak as she was he could see
that she was determined somehow or other
he didnt want to oppose her it was mighty
hard to be good in the face of such tempta-
tion the call of all that money was sound-
ing in his ears perhaps he could do it
without her knowing it but as he looked at
her standing there in her misery something
came into his heart and held him back

  however at a few minutes before eight
oclock that night  brown  taber met
stephen blander- on the appointed corner
and a few minutes later they walked into
joe smiths place

  they entered the same little room and
smith came in and took their order-and
closed the door

an engineer centenarian

october witnesses the one hundredth birthday of railroad veteran whose
son is eligible for an engineers age-pension

rocking peacefully to and fro in an arm-
chair john strange reeves probably one of
the oldest engineers in america passes each suc-
ceeding day in the shaded quiet of a comfortable
cottage on south k street tacoma washington
elated over the fact that next october eighteenth
will be his one hundredth birthday but disap-
pointed because he has been unable to see haileys
comet for the second time during his life

  living with a bachelor son and a housekeeper he
enjoys life to a marked degree keeping his custo-
dians busy watching him all the time because he
refuses to realize that his mentality is younger than
his physical strength and often wanders away from
their watchful care

  reeves comes from pennsylvania dutch stock
he was bom at yvilkesbarre lucerne county
pennsylvania october   and is the father
of fifteen children the oldest living son is now
seventy-two years of age all but four of the large
family of children have died through the sur-
vivors reeves can trace five living generations he
has twenty-eight grandchildren eleven great-grand-
childrbn and one great-great-grandchild living

   providence has been very kind to me he says
though i have had some mighty hard knocks at
times i have never been really sick for a day but
i met with several accidents which laid me up at
times

   until i was sixty years old i was a railway
engineer and made many records while taking loco-
motives in and out of cincinnati before that
time both my hands were injured-you can see they
are crippled now

   i never drank or smoked but i have chewed to-
bacco for a long long time i always went to bed
early and got up early and lived regularly i have
not been a vegetarian or dieted strictly on anything

   my oldest son john is a railway engineer on
the gould system in indiana hes run engines
there for more than fifty years and some time this
year he will be pensioned off and he is coming to
see me

  thirty years ago reeves met with a second acci-
dent on a locomotive and his skull was pierced by
the sharp end of a large oiling-can an operation
was necessary and at that time his skull was
trepanned with a silver plate
a corner in coyotes

by r k culver

          fresno smiths bright idea turned out to
          be a skin-game in more ways than one

ometimes said fresno smith
 im inclined toward a belief
that theres something supernatu-
ral about coyotes but maybe
im mistaken it may be only my
imagination i never did take
much stock in spirits and yet
when i hear coyotes unloading their funeral
song on a dark night like this i can come
mighty close to suspecting that the dead do
return and make noises

  at this point fresno smith kicked a dry
branch on the smoldering fire and peered over
his shoulder into the pitchy blackness
whence there came a series of quavering mel-
ancholy howls

    yes sir kind of prickly down the spine
thats the way they make me feel perhaps
i never mentioned it to you but another wise
man and myself a very long time ago got
mixed up in a deal in which coyotes figured
strong we learned considerable that time
about humans and coyotes the other wise
man knew more than i did to begin with

   he was a solomon on wild things he
kept cases on em all the way he could grab
off fancy latin names and hang them onto
anything from an ant to a buzzard was a
tribute to nature i tell you it was fine now
my strong point was human nature so we got
together on a scheme that took both kinds of
information

   but let me back up just a minute till i
tell you something more about old solomon
because he was the boy who started me to
working out my plan he collected specimens
and shipped em c o d to eastern points
some alive and some skinned with tags tied
to their hides

  the old professor was a wizard on ways and
means of separating from their natural
haunts all such parts of nature as were alive
and loose and valuable to parks museums

and menageries he had all other parties that
i ever met sewed up and looking foolish

  he took orders for everything along the
line from a blue-tailed skink which is a
kind of lizard to a california condor which
is some bird that flies high and is hard to
coop this solomon party he made good right
along

   one day i met him in the hills just be-
yond the rolling country where i was loafing
on a grub-stake making motions with a pick
and shovel now and then whenever anybody
happened to show up he wandered in car-
rying a butterfly net and a line of talk about
the scarcity of scorpions and tarantulas in
that section as against the large crop of the
previous year

  that is all ive got thus far says he
opening one of those carpet-bag valises and
exposing to view about fifteen fruit-jars full
of preserved snakes scorpions and big hairy
spiders along with some blue-bellied lizards
and a few homed toads i sprung a few old
snake yarns on him and we got acquainted
fine i found out as i was telling you that
he knew some things

   after a time i says  professor in die
course of your adventures and pursuit of
general information did you ever happen to
get next to the habit of the coyote 

    which habit  he says

    the only one he has that counts says
i  the habit of being heard and noticed a
good deal more than is necessary in a sheep
country and without ever stepping on the pan
of a trap or getting in front of a 

   he then informed me how he had once
fooled a noble specimen of  canis latrans or
prairie-wolf as he called it by means of a
lame jack-rabbit and about four-bits worth
of wire fencing

    but there js a far more scientific way
of capturing the wily beast says he


a corner in coyotes



    come across with it i says  you in-
terest me ive got a little scheme thats look-
ing bigger every minute

  then he went on to tell me that a pick
and shovel and a stick of giant powder was
the real surprise to spring on a coyote when
you got his home address with no spider-webs
across the opening

  dig him out he says but first you
have to find where he resides

    professor i says  fate has thrown you
and me together this old state of california
is pestered with those yellow sheep thieves
it offers real coin for coyote scalps of course
the bounty is away too small just now but it
will be raised if this ne plus ultra scheme of
mine pans out the way it ought to coyote
scalps will be quoted at five bucks apiece
when we get enough of them corraled and
after ive worked along the lines i will expose
to you directly

    the only trouble with coyotes is that
theyve been neglected they dont possess
the reputation for destructibility and rapid
increase which is coming to them all they
need is advertising leave it to me if you
come in on this deal youll get one-third of all
the profits and its easy money-very easy
well i talked the old boy
blind and it wasnt long before
he had agreed to help me collect
a bunch of coyotes for my coyote
ranch it was feasible all right
and the proposition looked hon-
est if you didnt glance at it too
close

   i took my old mule down to
bakersfield and came back with
two hundred yards of wire fen-
cing out of which i made a pen
around a big rock-pile on a sunny
slope when i had sunk the
fence three feet and leaned the
top in toward the center i had
a coyote - tight corral and was
ready for the breeding stock

   here was where old solo-
mon got busy he would find a
likely spot and then hed take
a piece of that wire fencing and
make a six-foot circle bending
in the ends almost to the center
leaving a little runway in be-
tween inside of that hed tie a
live jack-rabbit by one leg

   the coyotes would claw
around the outside of that circle
till they came to the opening
and then theyd just naturally

sift in the same as theyd go through a piece
of sage-brush sometimes wed find four or
five in there in the morning circling around
the inside of that deception and shooting
past the opening and against the other side
after they had followed up one of those
curved ends at a rate of speed which a coyote
always uses when hes scared it used to
make me laugli to see the way theyd fail to
find that exit

   but after a while one did accidentally
get onto it and he seemed to pass the news
around so we had to give that idea up there
was nothing to it then but to find where they
hid in the daytime and to dig em out and
let me tell you friends if youve never mined
coyotes youve missed considerable excite-
ment

   next to collecting rattlers with your bare
hands digging out coyotes is the most play-
ful and nerve-quieting sport i ever did enjoy
when you begin to see the two green lights at
the bottom of the hole you spread your wire
sack over it and shove a piece of lighted pitch-
pine down in among the animals and theres
something stirring presently

   i remember one old yellow dog got up so
much speed he tore right through the wire

he was a solomon on wild things


the railroad mans magazine

it used to make me laugh to
see the way theyd fail to
find that exit

mesh taking with him in his teeth a piece
of the professors old felt hat but we didnt
lose one often and inside of a month we had
the corral stocked up and then the food sup-
ply began to worry us

  for a while i knocked jack-rabbits over
with a  and kept the pen from starving on
our hands i got so i could pick a rabbit off
at a hundred yards no matter which way he
was headed nor how fast but shucks what
was the use i didnt have a gatling gun
and those coyotes they were always running
up and down that fence half starved

   one day i got to thinking about old man
bently tending to his flocks and herds up
on the grazing land a few miles north and
also of the fondness which a coyote has for
sheep to tell you the real truth this was
not what you would call a new idea with me
away back there when i framed the deal up
it had occurred to me that a pack of intelli-
gent coyotes sufficiently starved and turned
loose in the right locality at the proper hour
would help to raise the price of scalps

   in time the sheep men would set up a
holler that would get around to sacramento
where appreciations came from then i
would take the professor up that way and
arrange for him to give a little lecture before
the right committee on the destructive and
evasive habits of coyotes their annual rate
of increase and a scientific forecast as to the
future of the sheep industry being swallowed
hide and all by the increase in coyotes i

had heard old solomon talk some about evolu-
tion and the survival of the fittest and a lot of
stuff like that and i knew he could make good

   that night i picked out  prince  and
 wolf a couple of big half-starved coyotes
that jumped against the fence and wagged
their tails for more whenever i appeared with
two or three rabbits they seemed to sort of
like me and were getting tamer than the rest
i lassoed the two with a couple of bale-ropes
tied to the end of a pole and started out at
dusk when i reached the proper spot where
the odor of sheep was strong i turned em
loose

   in the morning they were back pacing
around the pen and looking fine and satisfied
around the girth you can see that there was
nothing to it from that on later in the
spring when the pups began to stick their
noses out of the holes in the rock-pile in the
middle of the pen i let the whole pack forage
and i dont believe i ever lost one anybody
knows you can domesticate a coyote and you
can take it straight from me they know more
than the smartest dog that ever walked

   it seemed a shame to do what i was going
to do with them the little woolly pups were
getting real playful many a night in the lone
moonlight ive sat and watched em maul
one another over and roll and tumble like a
lot of kittens then the old professor hed
drift out and ask me if the time for garnering
the profits wasnt about ripe he was a mer-
cenary person the professor was well i
a corner in coyotes



they seemed to sort of like me

needed cash myself so finally we landed up
at sacramento and went to work to get the
bounty raised

   just as i had expected those coyotes had
caused rumors of sheep destruction to float
in toward headquarters not only rumors
either there were sheep-men there to testify
that something had to be done to the carnivor-
ous coyote they played right into our hands
but to make things sure i took professor
solomon around to the committee-room and
turned him loose

   what he said to them was enough to curl
your hair why he showed by quoting dar-
win that according to the laws of evolution
and the survival of the fittest there would soon
be a breed of coyotes traveling up and down
the state as big as timber wolves and savager

  not only that but he also argued that in
the course of time nature would produce an
invisible coyote do you get that-an invisi-
ble coyote-one that could glide in past a
sheep-man and rub against his leg without
him seeing it at all all that he would no-
tice would be the damage that it left behind
i never knew before what the real advantage
of a college education was i sat up and took
notice when i heard the old professor spring
that one and saw him get away with it you
could have heard a pin drop when he finished
that coyote talk of his

   some of the committee rose and said that
 wasnt too much to raise the bounty on
coyote scalps after that but it seems as soon
as we got out they got more rational placing
the bounty at five dollars which was plenty
big enough for us and all i had expected
we hung around until it went through that
way and then we disappeared in the direction
of all those tame coyotes we had waiting to
be scalped

     professor i says  you are the wise old
owl in your line ill admit but when it comes
to human nature and the engineering of a
scheme i can give you cards this coyote
deal has gone right from the start and youll
get your third o k but ill tell you how i
feel about it its a shame to butcher all those
pets of mine for five apiece i cant ever
do it

   i saw a kind of cold gleam come into
his eye

    i have arranged for that he says ga-
zing far away

   supposing he meant chloroform or some
other pleasant scientific method of extermina-
tion i felt easier i thought id wait and
see

   when we got near to the ranch i noticed
a coyote streaking up the hill like the real
undomesticated type

    something has been around here and
has put the old fear into them i says and
when i got up close to the corral i understood

 some one else had been there and gathered
in those scalps there had been a massacre
i looked at the professor and i says  its back
 

the railroad mans magazine

 to town for me i need another grub-stake   i understand says he  that the bounty
 im dead broke	on coyotes has been raised to five dollars is

  old solomon he seemed to be preoccu- that true  

he argued that in the course of time nature would produce an invisible coyote

pied he was sizing up the buzzards that
were beginning to assemble there in large
numbers

     i will join you later he replied  if i
am not mistaken that is a california condor
over there on that fence-post and i think i see
another rara avis over there isnt that a
turkey buzzard in that flock with pink eyes
and with white feathers in his tail i have
orders for them both

   it was too sad a place for me as i rode
away that afternoon i met up with old man
bendy bringing in the sheep-that is what
was left of them

   yes i says  but who gave you the
information 

    oh a friend of mine that goes by the
name of solomon says he  he told me that
the price was going up and i was some inter-
ested seeing as ive been supplying sheep for
a coyote ranch he was running with me share
and share alike

    i was up there for a while yesterday
gathering in the scalp crop

   there being nothing more to say i just
moved on taking off my hat to him as i dis-
appeared ever since that time the howling of
coyotes bothers me

the riddle of the gage

by charles frederick carter

of all the vexatious problems of the railroad none has caused so much trouble
as that of its dimensions so far as the principal dimension is concerned
there has been no difficulty for it has been generally conceded that a rail-
road should be just long enough to reach from one terminus to the other

     but its width is a far different matter the proper distance between the
rails or in other words the gage is a point on which men may honestly differ
the problem is like an indeterminate decimal upon which one might figure forever
without reaching a final conclusion

     the late e h harriman expressed his conviction that the greatest mistake
ever made by the railroad-builders was in not adopting a six-foot gage others
as well qualified as harriman have entertained different views which they have
expounded at great length the problem has troubled railroad-builders the world
over ever since the first rails were laid

why the standard gage of four feet eight and one-half inches was
finally decided on after years of experimenting with
various widths from three feet up

ftephenson who saw the rail-
road first so to speak undertook
to settle the gage question himself
 without waiting for the advice or
consent of any one the wheels
on ordinary road-vehicles in eng-
land when stephenson achieved
his first triumph as well as on the horse-
tramways operated between various collieries
and the nearest navigable waters were  feet

	inches apart as the accepted idea of a
railroad was simply an improved form of
wagon-road and man being an imitative ani-
mal stephenson decided that his locomotive
should be of the same gage as a wagon

  but automatic machinery and accurate
templates and gages were not then in use
mechanics laboriously wrought everything
by hand and possibly they were not always
as painstaking as they might have been

  at all events when the  rocket  was as-
sembled in the shop its gage was found to
be  feet  inches it was another case of
good intentions gone wrong but after the
rocket had won such a sensational sue-

cess at the rainhill trials what was there to
do but copy it faithfully in subsequent loco-
motives 

  the rocket having become the model
for other locomotives it was definitely settled
that  feet sl inches was the proper gage
for a railroad the world adjusted its ideas
to this dictum and was moving smoothly and
harmoniously along until isambard brunei
the man who built the famous but unlucky
steamship great eastern objected

  brunei was a british engineer the son
of sir mark isambard brunei a famous in-
ventor and engineer who among many other
things surveyed in  the canal which
now connects lake champlain and the hud-
son river

  the younger brunei had a wonderfully
persuasive way which enabled him to manage
capitalists pretty much as he pleased in
 when the project of building the great
western railway of england was decided on
brunei was appointed chief engineer

  brunei was a man with an imagination
which enabled him to perceive the latent pos-


the railroad mans magazine

sibilities of the railroad more clearly than
many of his contemporaries he realized that
high speed was feasible but he erred regard-
ing the way it was to be attained

  he made the great mistake of believing that
a steam-engine was not capable of high
piston speed and that to get over the ground
rapidly a locomotive would have to have very
large driving-wheels to attain the speed he
wanted he figured that driving-wheels ten
feet in diameter were absolutely necessary

  such an engine would topple over in a little
less than no time on a railroad of the stephen-
son gage so to bring the center of gravity
down where it would have to behave itself
brunei determined that his ten-foot drivers
would have to be seven feet apart

  when it was announced that the great
western railway was to be a seven-foot gage
maybe there wasnt a row in great britain

  every man who didnt know anything
about railroads took his pen in hand and
wrote letters to the newspapers to prove that
the broad gage was or was not the proper
one

a costly change

  brunei and stephenson the leaders of the
broad and narrow gage forces for  feet j
inches was then considered narrow gage
and their chief adherents were the siege guns
in  the war of the gages as it was called

  lnforeseen events severely handicapped
brunei but did not cause him to lose the
contest when his express locomotive was
finished the wheels were so enormous that it
was almost impossible to start the engine
when it finally did get under way stop-
ping was equally as difficult the ten-foot
drivers had to be abandoned

  the railroad could not be abandoned and
it would cost altogether too much to change
the gage besides the affair of the ten-foot
drivers did not prove that anything was
wrong with the gage

  to be sure there could be no interchange
of traffic with connecting roads passengers
going to points not reached by the great
western had to change cars at junction points
which was not convenient

  unfortunately freight had to be trans-
shipped also and when packages routed via
the great western began to turn up in all
parts of the kingdom except their destination
the railroad officials began to hear from the
shippers manufacturers held conventions
adopted resolutions and made things gener-
ally hot for the great western

  finally the matter got into parliament
with the result that in  a royal com-
mission was appointed to inquire into the
general subject of railway gages the
commission listened to a very large volume
of testimony from which it was ultimately
deduced that the proper gage for all railroads
was  feet  inches

  for twenty years the contest waged end-
ing at length in a draw the great west-
ern continued to be operated as a broad-gage
road for a score of years until traffic condi-
tions compelled unconditional surrender and
it joined the ranks of the standard gage

  while the great issue smoldered in great
britain and on the continent as well the
railroad builders of the united states were
laying the foundations for trouble on their
own account like their british cousins
they could not agree on what gage railroads
should run

  the baltimore and ohios board of direc-
tors which sent a commission to great
britain to find out what a railroad was before
beginning construction copied the stephenson
gage of  feet sl inches only some of the
early railroads copied the baltimore and
ohio

  in new jersey there were some railroad
builders who thought  feet  inches was
the correct gage the first locomotive built
by the famous rogers locomotive works was
intended for this road it happened to
be the first engine equipped with a whistle
and president james of the mad river and
lake erie railroad of ohio who happened
to witness her trial trip was so tickled with
the whistle that he insisted upon buying it
for his road with the locomotive attached
it being the first locomotive on the first rail-
road operated in the buckeye state it set the
fashion in gages there

various gages

  while the prevailing gage in ohio was 
feet  inches in early days the sandusky
mansfield and newark railroad was  feet

	inches the atlantic and great western
the erie and the ohio and mississippi formed
a -foot gage route between new york and
st louis the mobile and ohio and vari-
ous other roads in south carolina and
georgia were  feet wide following the rec-
ommendation of horatio allen one of the
foremost of the pioneer railroad engineers
the st la-wrence and atlantic in maine and
canada was a  feet  inch gage

j p kirkwood chief engineer of the
the riddle of the gage



pacific railroad which was die first trans-
continental line on which construction was
begun but which has not yet got any farther
than pueblo colorado in its progress to the
pacific coast in a report to the board of
directors dated june   recommended
a gage of  feet  inches

  he gave cogent reasons for favoring this
gage and then quoted the opinions of eighteen
authorities including civil engineers loco-
motive engineers and others all of whom
favored a wider gage than  feet l inches
then known in america as in england as
narrow gage

  two were in favor of a -foot gage kirk-
woods recommendation was adopted and 
miles of the pacific railroad were built on a
gage of  feet  inches and so operated until
 when the road was reduced to standard
gage-

  for years the gage question in america
was a hopeless muddle each engineer had
his own idea the more plausible ones suc-
ceeded in getting their theories put into prac-
tise somewhere with confusing results

where engineers fear to tread

  legislators do not hesitate to rush in where 
engineers fear to tread learning what a
time everybody was having about so simple
a matter the legislature of missouri passed
a law which was approved february 
 section  of which reads as follows

  the gage of track or width between
rails of all railroads in this state shall be

	feet and  inches

  even this did not settle matters though
possibly it might have done so if a confla-
gration had not broken out in a totally unex-
pected quarter

  somebody in wales had a slate quarry in
order to get the product to market the owners
built a horse-tramway from portmadoc to
the quarries at dinas near festiniog a dis-
tance of j miles the tramway overcame
a total rise of  feet the steepest grade
being one foot in  this was back in 

  the festiniog railway as it was called
was the most remarkable railroad in the
world at that time for the builders undertook
to make its gage only two feet like stephen-
sons workmen they were not clever with the
foot rule so when the road was completed
and measured accurately it proved to be 
inches

  strangely enough no one paid the slightest
attention to this miniature railroad for 
years it pursued the even tenor of its way

transporting slate by horse-power every work-
ing day and earning money for its owners

  in  the owners awoke to the fact that
they were behind the age so they purchased
two locomotives they were toys weighing
but eight tons

gave free rides

  but they worked so well that the company
in  began hauling anybody who wanted
to ride free of charge next year some
coaches were put on and then fares were col-
lected the same as on any other road the
enterprise was so successful that the line was
relaid with rails weighing forty-eight pounds
to the yard and locomotives weighing ten
tons were put on still nothing happened

  finally in  fairlie invented a type of
engine which was the first attempt at what
is now known as the mallet articulated loco-
motive fairlie took two ordinary locomo-
tives with simple engines and hitched them
together fire-box to fire-box

  one of these fairlie engines the little
wonder was built for the festiniog rail-
way the little wonder weighed nine-
teen and a half tons each end of this me-
chanical siamese twins had a pair of
cylinders x inches and two pairs of
drivers twenty-eight inches in diameter

  it could take a trainload of  y tons
up the grade and could bring down a train-
load of  tons of which  tons was
paying load making a train  feet long

  the passenger-cars were  feet long 
feet  inches wide  feet  inches high
weighed  pounds and carried  pas-
sengers

  in  this toy railroad carried 
passengers  tons of miscellaneous
freight and  tons of slate earning a
total of 

  such an achievement as this could not fail
to attract attention london engineering
wrote up the festiniog railway then every
other publication took a turn at it imperial
princes and royal commissions from russia
spain france italy norway germany
brazil and the united states made pilgrim-
ages to festiniog to see just how small a
railroad could be and still earn dividends

  they were followed by so many self-ap-
pointed investigators that chief engineer
spooner began to wonder whether he was a
railroad manager or a showman


the railroad mans magazine

   the success of his road turned his head
and lie wrote a book and made addresses to
prove that  inches was the proper gage
for railroads about this time india was
bankrupting itself trying to build wide-
gage railroads

   these matters gave the press an excuse to
advocate narrow-gage railroads the ste-
phenson gage thereafter became standard
and everything less than that was narrow
gage 

  horace greeley spread the narrow-gage
contagion in the united states greeley was
peculiarly susceptible to new ideas and the
narrow-gage craze in his british exchanges
fascinated him he began to write editorials
for the tribune advocating narrow-gage
railroads

  the pennsylvania and kansas pacific
railroads had the honor of introducing gen-
eral william j palmer as the first narrow-
gage railroader in america backed by j
edgar thomson of the pennsylvania rail-
road s m felton and robert h lamborn
of philadelphia and governor a c hunt
of colorado he went to denver and in 
organized and began the construction of the
denver and rio grande railroad which
was a three-foot gage 

  when palmer announced that he had
built the first  miles at a cost of 
a mile while the kansas pacific had cost
 a mile denver became excited over
narrow gage

everything was narrow gage

   everything in town from street railroads
to cocktails was narrow gage during the
most acute stage of the attack it was consid-
ered the correct thing to refer to the pros-
pectors most useful ally the donkey as a
 narrow-gage mule

   other narrow-gage railroads were built up
the canons radiating from the colorado
metropolis the line up clear creek canon
which overcomes a rise of  feet in 
miles was built at a cost of  a mile
as compared with an estimated cost of 
for a standard-gage road

  denver the focal center of the narrow-
gage propaganda created a disturbance that
attracted the attention of the whole railroad
world the russian government fixed a gage
of  feet  inches for new and important lines
india after a severe contest formally adopted
a gage of  feet  inches carl pihl the
norwegian engineer induced his country to
adopt  feet  inches france belgium

switzerland italy austria and germany
also began to build narrow-gage lines

  as for the united states the printing-
presses could scarcely turn out narrow-gage
railroad stock fast enough a great national
narrow-gage convention was held in st louis
in  at which everything was settled in-
cluding the standard height of draw-bars for
narrow-gage cars which was to be 
inches from the top of the rail to the center
of the drawhead

the change

  much was made by the newspapers of the
first narrow-gage cars and engines for the
denver and rio grande the coach was 
feet long  feet wide  feet high from
rail to roof it weighed  pounds and
seated  passengers  abreast a double seat
on one side and a single seat on the other

the first box-cars were yz feet long

	feet wide weighed  pounds and
nominally carried  tons

  the first locomotive a baldwin named the
montezuma had four drivers  inches in
diameter a pony truck and cylinders x
inches the top of the stack was  feet 
inches above the top of the rail the  mon-
tezuma which weighed  pounds had
a tractive power of  tons on the level and
of  tons on an -foot grade

  nearly every state in the union began
building narrow-gage railroads nearly all
being of -feet gage on february  
there were  miles of narrow-gage rail-
road in operation in  states and canada
and  miles were projected

  gradually the country began to recover
from the narrow-gage delirium the numer-
ous projects for narrow-gage roads were al-
lowed to gather dust in pigeonholes while
the building of them just stopped a few
years later a m wellington an eminent
authority on railroad engineering was able
to write

   the irresistible logic of events has practically
   settled the question and the belief in the nar-
   row gage as an expedient and defensible sys-
   tem of construction which from the beginning
   was founded on illusion and delusion is rapidly
   passing away

traffic needs considered

  about the same time the owners of the
broad-gage roads finding themselves hope-
lessly handicapped by their inability to inter-
change traffic with the majority of roads
v the riddle of the gage



which were of standard gage began to bring
their rails closer together the ohio and
mississippi the western end of the -foot
route between st louies and new york led
the way

  on january   the board of direc-
tors voted to change to standard gage forty
standard-gage locomotives and a few stan-
dard-gage cars were ordered and arrange-
ments were made to alter  locomotives and
 cars from broad gage to standard at a
cost of  per locomotive  per pas-
senger-coach and  per freight-car

  saturday july   all broad-gage
rolling-stock was disposed so as to clear the
track at midnight at dawn on sunday july
 the work of changing the track from
broad to standard gage was begun at 
am the entire main line and louisville
branch altogether more than  miles was
finished

  this was a remarkable feat which de-
manded system and discipline of a pretty
high order it was not surpassed until 
between may  and june  of that year
more than  miles of track in the south
were changed from broad to standard on
no road was there any interruption of traffic
for more than one day

  the louisville and nashville changed
 miles including main lines and sidings
on may  s the total number of men
required for this great task was  an
average of four men per mile

  beginning at four oclock in the morning
of july   the mobile and ohio changed
more than  miles of track from broad to
standard gage in twelve hours interfering
with the movement of but one passenger
train and a few freights

  one days cooked rations were carried on
push-cars together with spikes and tools and
other necessaries one broad-gage push-car
was kept ahead of the work and a standard-
gage car followed the best record made by
any crew that day was  miles of track
changed in  hours

  that settled the broad-gage railroad in the
united states now the only broad gage so
far as i know is the mount washington rack
road which is of  feet  inches gage through-
out its entire length of  - miles

  the railroads of the united states to-day
are all df standard gage with double tracks
and sidings spaced  feet apart from center
to center some though are only  feet
or yi feet center to center while a few
including the illinois central are  feet
in the south most of the roads are  feet 

    	r r

inches gage while a few are  feet -
inches practically all railroads widen the
gage on curves at a fixed rate per degree of
curvature the maximum being half an inch

  but if any man thinks the narrow-gage
road has disappeared utterly he is very much
mistaken the denver and rio grande sys-
tem still includes  miles of -foot gage
and there are other narrow-gage railroads in
colorado there are some -foot gage tracks
in pennsylvania and still others in new
mexico utah arizona nevada and cali-
fornia together with some -foot gage

  the nevada california and oregon rail-
road to be  miles long when completed is
of -foot gage massachusetts has a -foot
gage road the boston revere beach and
lynn

  maine has a weakness for railroads of
-foot gage some of which are earning four
per cent dividends while others are earning
deficits just like some of the bigger roads
one of the longest of these -foot gage roads
is the wiscasset waterville and farmington
railroad from wiscasset to winslow 
miles the phillips and rangeley railroad
also a -foot gage is  miles long

  the longest -foot gage railroad in the
world is the otavi from the seaport of
swakopmund in german southwest africa
to otavi a distance of  miles construc-
tion on this line was begun in august 
and was finished in 

  it was a hard road to build for native
wars deprived the contractors of their first
force while the imported men who took their
places spent most of their time striking

  water was very scarce-so scarce in fact
that it had to be hauled forty miles

  after the steel was partly laid water was
hauled on trains for a hundred miles to the
men at the front yet in spite of these
drawbacks the line which was built to de-
velop some copper mines became self-sup-
porting a year after it was completed

  india and australia have railroads of as-
sorted gages up to j feet belgium and
france have narrow-gage roads sandwiched
in among the standard gage the caen
dives and luc railway in france of -
incli gage pays seven per cent dividends
italy has a large assortment of gages begin-
ning at yz inches and running up to
standard

  reduced to its elements the gage situation
at present is just this

  any man who has the money may build a
railroad of any gage he pleases then he is
at liberty to make it pay-if he can
billys unavoidable delays

by george foxhall

        what had to be done to prevent the p s and n b r r
        from buying any more second-hand motive-power

he most polite man in the world
could not have called the p s
and n b a first-class railroad
and jim parkinson was not
even the most polite man in
new mexico perhaps it is
not giving jim too much praise to say that
he was actually the least polite man in new
mexico-or any other territory or sovereign
state in our union

  what jim could say of the p s and
n b can therefore be readily imagined
this be it understood was on ordinary oc-
casions but what jim said of the p s and
n b when it made him miss the mail con-
nection with his varnished flier five times in
one week was a series of masterpieces in the
railroad mans fine art of saying things
about a railroad

  this was how it happened but first we
shall have to explain a little jim did not
work for the p s and n b if you had
mentioned such a possibility to him he
would have assured you-in terms admitting
no debate-that he did not

  the road jim worked for was the swellest
of the swell transcontinental highways its
road-bed was only equaled by its signaling
system its signaling system by its electric-
lighted cars its electric-lighted cars by its
high-speed locomotives and its high-speed
locomotives by jim while all were perfect

  but even perfect road-bed perfect equip-
ment and perfect engineers must in this im-
perfect world be handicapped in operation
and the handicap of the southern trans-
continental was the p s and n b

  now the p s and n b had at one time
been a prosperous little railroad of thirty-
two and a quarter miles that was in the
days of the lumber - camps gradually
however the lumber had grown less and less

finally there was hardly enough lumber to
fence a barn-yard

  farmers were slow in settling the country
and the finances of the p s and n b sank
into such insignificance that the duties of the
auditor would have been slightly less weari-
some than those of the crossing-tender had
the p s and n b possessed an official of
either type-which it did not

  when the southern transcontinental was
building prosperity was still hovering smi-
lingly over the p s and n b and the
road was not for sale accordingly the
s t had been compelled to make a wide
detour adding twenty miles of curves and
tunnels and stiff grades to the smaller roads
thirty-odd miles of valley track and the
s t had never forgiven the owners of the
p s and n b

  but hate must give way to convenience
and when the great rivalry for the mail con-
tracts came about the s t was glad
enough to run a couple of miles of track at
one end and a couple of hundred yards at
the other end of the jerk-water road and
making a running agreement for two trains
a da- over the perfectly level short cut
thus secure the contract

  shortly after this came the slump for the
p s and n b and wilbur warfield
president and principal stockholder had ap-
proached the s t with a proposition for
the sale of the road the s t knowing
that its close-shaven running contract was
now the chief financial support of the p s
and n b smiled to itself as it reminisced
over the millions that mr warfields obsti-
nacy had cost it on kn earlier occasion-
and refused to buy

  instead it offered a mortgage which mr
warfield with newly acquired insight re-
fused to consider
billys unavoidable delays



now things were coming to a crisis and
mr warfield was talking things over with
his vice-president master mechanic road-
foreman of engines and only engineer
- billy macdonald

     billy he said  unless we can get the
 s t to buy us by the end of the month
 we shall have to accept their mortgage and
 you know what that means

     i do said the vice-president etc

     that piece of motive - power of yours
 billy ran away with all our salaries for
 the- month and some over and to run six
 trains a day even with the same engine
 engineer and conductor costs money

     it sure does but we had to have that
 old horse as you know the old  hadnt
 a sound flue or connection in her and every
 thrust of her pistons threatened to wrap her
 side rods round her steam dome and would
 have - done so only she couldnt make
 enough steam to more than-just move em

     i know billy it was only the mercy of
 providence and the cleverest engineer in the
 u s a that kept her old flat wheels limp-
 ing on the rails as long as they did you
 surely are a wonder when it comes to tinker-
  ing billy you certainly have the courage
 of your convictions billy why dont you
 resign and go on the s t while we still
 have our self-respect

    it was a trick of billys to continue his
 conversation where he left off no matter
 how long the interruption when the inter-
 ruption was particularly distasteful to him

    and as for that second-hand water-
 boiler on wheels that you bought from the
 atkinson and santa maria i might as well
 tell you that its a hop-skip-and-a-jump
 four-flusher it hasnt a weak spot in it
 relatively speaking because it hasnt got one
 spot that can brag over another an some
 day its going to pieces like the deacons one-
 hoss shy

   tandem compound huh tandem
 compound what did we want any sort of
 a compound for she eats up more coal
 than a-steamboat and dont go as fast as a
 snow-plow

   why billy i thought you were so
 tickled over that new - second - hand com-
 pound that you hated to stop her even at
 terminals didnt i hear you telling your
 kid fireman and jim parkinson who was
 guying you about her that she was your
 arab steed or something and you cer-
 tainly have fixed her up to look fine

praise is a great wonder-worker still
one would hardly imagine that this small

commendation was enough to affect the
cool-headed young scotchman

  whatever it was whether it was the
praise or the sudden remembrance of some
forgotten fine point in his  arab steed
billy seemed suddenly to change his point
of view he grinned cheerfully he
beamed he gurgled he laughed

  yes he said happily she certainly
does look fine doesnt she with her painted
boiler and lacquered cylinder-covers and
polished nuts and rods and her neat little
sweet little dinky side-cranes to swing her
front cylinder cases on-all as handy as an
operating-room 

   she is one glorious credit to the road
and to me she is inspiring she is the
sign of hope cheer up mr warfield
well sell the road all right and still
chuckling billy made for the door

  mr warfield was alarmed had the
trials of his position and his affectionate loy-
alty to the road unhinged the young mans
mind 

   i say billy he called after him
why dont you resign and- but billy
was gone

  many people had asked billy macdon-
ald that same question and had received
answers that no chaldean soothsayer could
have understood or explained and chal-
dean soothsayers could explain pretty nigh
everything whether they understood it or
not

  jim parkinson had asked it almost every
day and so had mr warfield but hereto-
fore the latter had asked it with a twinkle
in his eye and a wink toward the portrait of
his daughter maggie that stood on the pres-
idential desk mr warfield knew why
billy stuck to the p s and n b and so
did billy and so did maggie as for the
rest it was none of their business

  and now mr warfield was genuinely
alarmed for his vice-president engineer and
prospective son-in-law anybody who could
try to assure him with-he must confess it
-a rather silly grin on his face that the
s t would buy the p s and n b r r
by the end of the month this being the tenth
must be on the verge of mental disintegra-
tion

  as for billy he climbed into his engine
and made a slow but successful run to por-
terville hauling three creaking coaches two
cars of miscellaneous freight and one near-
ly blind old woman with a nearly blind dog

then he made the return trip to bris-
combe minus the freight and with half a


the railroad mans magazine

dozen stolid farm laborers in addition to the
old woman who never left the train until the
final trip and always at the place where she
got on billy and the conductor always let
her ride and she always rode though never
going anywhere because she liked the gen-
tle motion so did the dog they were
billys mascots

  on the second trip out to porterville
things began to go wrong they had two
hours and a quarter to make it in and clear
the mail flier usually they made it in an
hour and fifty-five minutes jim parkinson
was pulling the flier when he had waited
ten minutes he began to swear when he
had waited fifteen minutes he continued his
uninterrupted swearing and when he had
waited twenty-five he sought the despatcher

  just as he was in the midst of an oratori-
cal demand for orders to dash at schedule
speed over the single track of the p s
and n b and was compromising with or-
ders to flag his way down billy pulled in
jim saw him and dashed down the steps and
up to billys cab to give him a quick but
complete glimpse at the state of his mind

  whats the matter with that old egg-
boiler of yours if i had a tin ten-legged
arab nag like that id set him plowing up
the sahairy desert or doin somethin more
useful than holdin up united states mail
for a real railroad a donkey-engine on
cog-wheels could haul a train fastern that
old cast-off teakettle

  jim would have said more only he hadnt
time and billy might have replied but
there was nobody to reply to so he just
grinned his lately acquired silly grin at the
back of the departing jim and by a won-
derful process managed to assume the most
wobegone face for the benefit of the division
superintendent of the s t who came up at
that instant

   awful sorry we delayed you mr sum-
mers he said  but i lost a crosshead-nut
five miles out of briscombe and didnt dare
move her either way on only one side she
pretty near coughs her soul-bolt out run-
ning on two sides and if wed gotten per-
manently laid out it would have meant a
worse lay-out for the flier had to send my
fireman back for a nut

  send your fireman back for a nut
shouted the old man wrathfully  send
your fireman back for a nut nice old
postscript of a near-broke road you work
for send your fireman back for a nut
why didnt you find the nut and send him
back for an engine send your fireman

  back for a nut eli why didnt you make
your fireman haul the train

  then evidently losing his wrath in this
close survey of the offending decapod he
suddenly exclaimed wonderingly  say
billy where did you get all that paint

  for a second billy had to duck in his
cab on the pretext of picking up a piece of
waste then he turned a face full of seri-
ous enthusiasm to the super

  now honest mr summers dont you
think she looks like a pippin dont you
think shes a credit to the man that decorated
her dont you think she looks as if she
could haul the flier easily guess she could
too with a bit of practise of course any
engine can lose a nut now i once-

  but the vision of an engine going through
training stunts to haul his crack flier was
too much for mr summers and with a
disgusted grin he made his escape from the
man he had come to rake over even an
irate superintendent has somewhere a hidden
sense of humor

  but if mr summers had a sense of hu-
mor it was put finally out of commission
when a similar accident delayed the flier
over half an hour the next day

  when the third day brought an even
longer delay he could have eaten the p s
and n b its lone decapod and billy with-
out even the smallest grain of salt

  on the fourth day billy managed to clear
and lie patted his arab steed affectionately
on her double-jointed cylinders and called
his fireman to witness that not a sweeter-
running piece of machinery was carried on
wheels the fireman who considered billy
the greatest mechanical genius of the age
agreed with him blindly

  but the fifth day was another  unavoid-
able delay and the sixth day saw tragedy
stalking grimly over the ties

  it was at the fill across the deep dip
swamp where die beautiful pride of billys
heart blew out her left high-pressure cylin-
der-head billy choked her off and looked
solemnly across at his fireman

  now wouldnt that hot your boxes
ben here we are over the swamp an
ive got to tie up that bad wing an run her
in on one side now ben i know darned
well that this willing engine cant do what
she cant do dont i yes i do and
what she cant do is to pull this train into
porterville with her right side in the con-
dition her right side is in at this minute
didnt we hear that right side hammering
like a boiler-shop this morning
billys unavoidable delays



 we certainly did billy attested ben
so what shall i do ben ill show you
some mechanical tricks we take this block
and tackle and this wrench and we climb
out of this cab-

  billy backed down onto the toes of the
conductor who nearly rolled backward into
the swamp- and we go to this neat little
dinky little crane with which all p s and
n b engines are equipped and we proceed
to remove this forward cylinder cover with
a view to doing the same tiling to the pound-
ing in the low-pressure cylinder-which we
do then we tie up our broken member
and proceed on our way without having held
up the snobby flier of the s t more than
an hour and forty-two minutes 

  billy quickly proceeded to suit the action
to the words he swung the little crane out
and rigged up his block then he ham-
mered and wrenched and pulled and heaved
and propped until in about half an hour
the front cylinder cover was swaying uncer-
tainly from the crane while ben the fire-
man clung for dear life to the rope that
supported it for there was no check-pawl
on billys crane

  billy was just diving into the inner mys-
teries of the exposed cylinder when the
exhaust of a hurrying engine was heard

  ha he said without looking up jim
comes to seek us we shall show him what
an expert engineer ought to know

  billy was so engrossed with his work that
he did not look up until jim parkinsons
voice caused him to jump suddenly he
dropped his wrench on the toes of the de-
voted ben who was struggling to make
fast his cumbersome charge

  ben let everything go to grab his foot
and before a hand could be raised the cyl-
inder-cover slipped down dragged the fast-
weakening crane from its bolts and rolled
with an appearance of thankful finality
into the swamp

  billy looked in despair at parkinson
why jim what you pushing the wreck-
ing outfit for

  jim was businesslike he was too busi-
nesslike even to curse the p s and n b
the elephantine proboscis of the wrecking
crane hovered hungrily over the pitiably dis-
mantled tandem compound

  billy said jim youve had a wreck
or the second cousin to one on this unfor-
tunate road pretty near every day this week
why shouldnt i bring the wrecker youre
a-friend of mine billy but theres a man on
that flat car with a shotgun and instruc-

tions to help me move this wreck has the
p s and n b any passengers

   i must admit that it has jim answered
billy stating the fact with the seriousness
it deserved  it has one aged female
woman nearly blind and one aged female
dog nearly blind also besides that it has
one car of cauliflowers from farmer per-
kins and nothing more the old dog lias
two teeth but they are both in one jaw so
she is harmless the old lady and the
cauliflowers are ditto

  conductor said jim turning to the
inarticulate youth who officiated in that
capacity for the p s and n b remove
your passengers to the baggage-car of the
flier and beware of the shotgun we are
going to remove the wreck

  jims removal of the wreck - engine
coaches and car of cauliflowers - is local
history in that part to get the engine in
shape to be pushed back would have meant
two hours delay for when billy had jammed
on the air-brake it refused to be jammed off
so piece by piece the rolling-stock of the
p s and n b was hoisted by that hungry
proboscis and dropped into the swamp while
billy looked sadly on

  then they pushed on to briscombe and
there jim handed in a telegram it read

  av b summers division superintendent

    s t r r porterville 

    have dumped entire motive-power and roll-
  ing stock of p s and n b from their own
  tracks into deep dip swamp advise presi-
  dent to buy their old road and stop cost out
  of my pay	parkinson

  five days later wilbur warfield miss
maggie warfield and william macdonald
were laughing happily over a communica-
tion from the president of the s t in
which the transcontinental offered the
stockholders of the p s and n b seven
hundred thousand dollars and the assuming
of all indebtedness for their title to the
right-of-way etc etc of the p s and
n b - all the officers of the road to be
taken in forming a new division with a
division superintendent

  there was a postscript stating that this
prompt action was being taken to prevent
the p s and n b acquiring any more sec-
ond-hand motive-power

  billy said mr warfield before i
accept i resign and elect you president
thatll make you division superintendent
and i said billy am going home to
write jim parkinson to come and be best
man at the wedding

by gilson willets

special traveling correspondent of the railroad mans magazine

to the ladies of the rail-god bless em at last mr willets in his long
x journey in quest of tales to tell has gathered the bunch of yarns we have
wanted-and the heroine of each one is a member of the fair sex each
heroine really had something to do with railroad life-something that was far
more tangible than riding in a passenger-coach

    we are glad to be able to hook up to just such stories as these the in-
fluence of woman permeates all branches of american industrial life and the part
that she plays in the great american railroads-whether it be the fair stenog-
rapher or the g m or the wife of the humblest tallow-pot-her interest in all
that makes this great throbbing railroad life possible is as keen as that of a man

     the mere presence of women is a great harmonizer said a great french
philosopher whose think-nozzle never became clogged we agree with him and
rise again to the toast  to the ladies of the rail-god bless em 

no -some railroad girls ive met

a necklace of bullets-edith jarnagin the despatcher-the c gs sten-
ographer-couple no -the bet she lost-the b and o

polar expedition-when mother allen moved

young woman riding a mexican
pony loped past the shack
bearing the big sign sa-
loon near the right-of-way
of the new st louis browns-
ville and mexico railway at
brazoria texas sixty miles south of hous-
ton the northern terminus of the road the
line was then building down the texas gulf
coast and brazoria was the front

  within the shack were gathered a number
of the railway-construction gang and a few
graders and when the horsewoman passed
one of the track-layers said

   its the lady doctoress

  prettiest lady between kings ranch
and corpus christi said a grader

   its third-drink time said a third mem-

series began in june railroad mans



ber of the construction outfit  and it should
be unanimous in our midst that we take said
drink standin up in honor of said lady doc-
toress

  in response to this proposed toast a gra-
der known as miguel the mexican ut-
tered a certain remark which mqt with such
vehement disapproval of all the other men
present that they  allowed  it would be a
good thing to swing miguel from the cross-
arm of one of the telegraph-poles that had
recently been planted beside the new right-
of-way

  thats what the outfit told miguel-just
to scare him

  pretending to be in earnest they dragged
him out to a telegraph-pole and put a lariat
around his neck just then a texas ranger
magazine single copies  cents
ten thousand miles by rail



one well known to the construction outfit
rode up and expostulated against the pro-
ceeding

  the boys took him aside informed him
that they were merely playing a joke on
miguel and requested him to  sit out of
the game

  at the same time miguel scared half to
death suddenly turned grim comedy into
dire tragedy

  slipping free of the noose he rushed to
where the ranger was sitting on his horse
leaped into the saddle behind the rider
whom he pinioned with his arms while ur-
ging die horse into action with his heels

  the animal guided by miguel who had
seized the reins dashed away toward a deep
dry arroycr

  on the edge of the abyss the horse plant-
ed his hoofs refusing to make the leap
whereupon miguel performed a horrifying
act for which he could not account later
except on the ground that the threat to hang
him had driven him crazy with fear so that
he hardly knew what he was doing

  while holding the ranger in an iron grasp
with one arm he used the other to drive a
knife deep into the horses flank

  with a pitiful neigh of pain the beast
reared and was about to take the fatal leap
when the ranger with almost inhuman
strength freed himself from the mexicans
grasp secured a hold on the reins and turned
the horse on its hind legs

  as the steed then sped away from the
arroyo miguel
lifted his knife
as if he intended
to stab the ranger

  a p i s t o -shot
rang out and the
mexican tumbled
from the horse

one of the con-
struction-gang had
fired that shot ta-
king the chance of
hitting the ranger
instead of  the
greaser

  an hour later
the lady doctor-
ess  came riding
back past the
shack in front of
which she found
a number of men
gathered around
one who lay on

the ground after asking what had hap-
pened she was told that miguel the mexi-
can had been shot and was about ready for
a coroner

  springing from her horse the lady doc-
toress knelt over the man lying on the
ground examined him with a few swift
movements seemed to be in doubt about
something then put the crystal of her watch
to the mans lips

  did you mean to bury this man she
asked presently taking a look at her watch
receiving an affirmative answer she added

   then you would have buried him alive
i think his life can be saved he must be
carried over to my office at once hurry
please

  three weeks later  miguel the mexican 
was able to walk and the construction men
promptly ordered him to leave die region in
a hurry

   soon after that the  lady doctoress  was
seen wearing a bullet attached to a chain
around her neck it was the bullet she had
extracted from miguels body it indicated
that she had saved the life of a human
being

  time passed and still the front of
the new texas railroad was at brazoria

  one day the construction train met with

an accident which
	was followed by a

  shooting affray
the lady doctor-
ess  attended to
the men injured in
the railroad mix-
up and saved the
life of the mail hit
when the lead was
distributed in a
short time she ap-
peared with two
bullets pendant
from the chain at
her throat

  months passed
and the road was
nearing comple-
tion many acci-
dents had occurred
in which men of
the construction
outfit were injured

  many shooting
scraps had taken
place and the phy-
sician who attend-
ed those who were

her necklace contained no less than twenty bullets


the railroad mans magazine

injured within twenty miles of brazoria was
the lady doctoress

  it was she who probed for bullets after
the shooting scraps and now her necklace
contained fifteen or sixteen bullets each one
representing a separate surgical operation
and a life saved

  general offices of the railway were opened

at kingsville a little south of the midway
point on the -mile line between houston
and brownsville there general manager
rodgers one day said to superintendent fin-
negan 

   we need a surgeon on the brazoria divi-
sion how would it do to give the appoint-
ment to that young woman up there who
has done such good work during the period
of construction-miss herzog

  dr sophie herzog replied superin-
tendent finnegan never heard of a wo-
man railroad surgeon did you

  no but that makes no difference

miss herzog has proven over and over again
that shes the equal if not the superior of
any male physician on the line

  the result was that dr sophie herzog
was appointed a surgeon of the st louis
brownsville and mexican railroad with a
district embracing some fifty miles of line
up and down from brazoria every man
on the line was glad to hear of the ap-
pointment

she had indeed made herself beloved by
all the hands employed on the new railroad
any man injured in an accident on the
tracks or wounded as the result of gun play
was only too glad to be attended by the
lady doctoress of bra-
zoria

no woman in all the re-
gion was so highly respected
nor so thoroughly admired
by the railroaders as was
dr sophie herzog

   the new road opened for
business and had been run-
ning regular trains for two
or three years when early
in  a surgeon of the
illinois central railroad
paid a visit to the texas
gulf coast making a stop
at brazoria

   there he met dr sophie
herzog having been shown
the now famous necklace of
bullets the illinois central
surgeon remarked

  theres certainly no
dearth of human target prac-
tise down this way

    is that not always the
case when a new railroad
pushes through a sparsely-
settled region like this  
answered miss herzog

   one year later i met that
illinois central surgeon in new orleans
whither he had come to attend a convention
of railroad surgeons connected with the vari-
ous roads traversing the southern states
he told me this story of one who so far as
he knew was  the only woman railroad sur-
geon in the united states if not in the world

    and her necklace when i visited bra-
zoria last year contained no less than twenty
bullets the illinois central surgeon added
 each bullet represented a surgical opera-
tion while the unique ornament as a whole
meant that my confrere dr sophie herzog
had saved the lives of no less than twenty

she set down the approximate location of every train
ten thousand miles by rail



men connected with the new railroad which
b f yoakum built down to the southern-
most town in the united states

  long ago i found that the wives daugh-
ters sisters sweethearts and women-friends
of railroaders read the railroad mans
magazine quite as much as the railroad
men themselves this is then a railroad
womans magazine as well as a railroad
mans magazine so here is an all-heroine
group of tales of certain of the girls in
dixie camps

the train-despatcher girl

  the engineers conductors and other
trainmen of the chattanooga southern rail-
way shook their heads when miss edith
jarnagin was made train-despatcher in the
general offices of the road at chattanooga

  edith jarnagin did not become the czar-
ina of a train-sheet by any haphazard
chance by pull or by favoritism she
earned that sheet and this was what she
did

  for several years she had been an expert
telegrapher holding a job at a station on the
chattanooga southern below chattanooga
one morning there was  wire trouble  of a
kind never before known in that region
the electrical disturbance was frightful
mysterious even appalling

  when operators opened a key brilliant
sparks would fly out the wires made
strange noises whenever an operator tried to
send a message fuses burned out com-
munication between all stations and the des-
patchers office was cut off and for five
hours trains had to run without orders and
get through the best they could

  most of the trains didnt get through at
all they got tangled up in bunches pas-
senger engineers found themselves on side
tracks while freights monopolized the main
tracks

  at the station where edith jarnagin was
operator no less than seven or eight trains
came to a standstill all having run so far as
they could without orders

   in this tangle of trains there was a special
which positively had to be moved and the
problem confronting the train crews was-
how to get past the stalled trains

  conductors and engineers argued and dis-
cussed ways and means trainmen butted in
with advice and section foremen suggested
this and that

  all the while the young lady operator in
the station sat figuring on a big sheet of

paper she set down the approximate loca-
tion of every train on the thirty-odd miles of
track between her own station and chat-
tanooga

  she then drew a plan of all the tracks
main side switch and y within miles
of where she sat having looked she
leaped-out to the arguing train crews

   it took her two minutes to show the freight
engineers exactly what to do with their trains
and to convince the passenger men of the
movements they could make she showed
indeed that by moving all the stalled trains
in accordance with her plan the special could
proceed at once and get to the end of the line
without further delay

  the work was done and well done just
as she had suggested

  a few days later the general manager sent
a message to edith jarnagin asking her to
come to chattanooga to see him

  wondering if she was about to be laid
off or jacked up or fired for some
mistake or misdemeanor miss jarnagin
traveled to chattanooga and hurried to the
general offices where she was ushered into
the general managers sanctum

  miss jarnagin said the general mana-
ger  i learn that you have a head for
mathematics such as a train-despatcher need
possess

   not at all sir

  and that you have strong nerves quick-
ness and tact-such as make a successful
train-despatcher

  no its a mistake sir

   and that you possess fertility in ex-
pedients for overcoming delays and provid-
ing against accidents-these being also the
qualifications of a good train-despatcher
nothing of the sort sir

  all or which continued the general
manager have militated in your favor to the
extent of inducing me to offer you the po-
sition of train - despatcher at these head-
quarters

  oh no sir i couldnt think of it
very well miss the matter is settled
you may report at once to the chief train-
despatcher and begin work

  next day conductors and engineers of the
chattanooga southern shook their heads from
side to side they were now receiving orders
from a girl train-despatcher and they pre-
dicted all sorts of terrible mixups

  weeks passed and the conductors and
engineers still shook their heads-not from
side to side now but up and down the
lieadshaking had become a nodding

  edith jarnagin had made good and the
boys were proud of the first girl train-des-
patclier in the railroad camps at dixieland

the c cs stenographer

  among the clerks in the office of the mas-
ter mechanic of the virginia and southwest-
ern railway at bristol tennessee was a
general air of expectancy everybody was
on the alert ever man appeared earlier
than usual on that morning in january
even the master mechanic himself arrived
fully five minutes ahead of his customary
time

  a new stenographer was expected that
morning she was very pretty it was said

  certain improvements were noted in the
sartorial appearance of the chief clerk to the
master mechanic proctor brown for ex-
ample mr browns shoes had gathered an
unwonted shine the necktie lie wore had
never before been seen in that office and the
crease in his trousers had a razor edge

  the new stenographer was coming to work
exclusively for the chief clerk

  on the stroke of nine miss carrie cor-
bett stenographer entered

  she had arrived only the night before from
her home at morristown tennessee and was
a total stranger to all in the master mechan-
ics office-in fact to all bristol

  the instant and unanimous verdict in the
master mechanics office was that nothing
lovelier in feminine apparel had ever been
employed in any department of the virginia
and southwestern

  with lightning-like flashes out came the
long rapier pins from her picture hat then
in a twinkling sheets of typewriting paper
were clasped around the lower ends of her
sleeves forming protective cuffs in a jiffy
off came the cover of the typewriting machine

  in a voice alluringly sweet and low miss
corbett said

  all ready mr brown

  chief clerk brown cleared his throat
moistened his lips and began dictating

  biff bang whizz sizz zip an-
swered the typewriting machine registering
words with the rapidity of an electric piano
playing a galop

   brown accelerated his talking gait but the
machine stayed right with him neck and
neck then he tried pouring out words with
the velocity of a campaign spellbinder
still the machine stayed right with him
when he paused for half a second the op-
erator twirled her thumbs and let it become

known by her expression that she was inde-
scribably bored by the manifestly slow pace
at which correspondence moved

   looks like youre going a hundred words
a minute miss corbett panted chief clerk
brown mopping the sweat of honest toil from
his brow

   hundred and elevens my record an-
swered the new stenographer  but i see
im going to fall off in speed in this office
for lack of practise i can do a hundred a
minute blindfolded

  three weeks passed a mere eighteen days
of toil in the master mechanics office on
the first day of the fourth week of miss
corbetts engagement chief clerk brown
said to her

  take this please the words began
rolling from his mouth like wheels down hill
the machine keeping pace as usual

   cross all that out said brown sud-
denly and take this instead begin this
letter with  dear miss  

  miss who snapped the operator

   ill let you know later carrie

   company letter-head  

  no carrie private all right - let
her go and brown dictated this

  dear miss

    having tired myself to exhaustion in repeat-
  ed and futile attempts to feed words fast enough
  to please a typewriter-girl who eats up whole
  stacks of dictionaries faster than any locomotive
  on the line eats tons of coal i veam for rest
  and believe that the only way to get it is to fire
  the typewritist as you have known her since
  she came into this world i write this to ask if
  you think she would object if the notice of dis-
  missal were put into her hands in the form of a
  certificate of marriage please wire answer
  immediately

  having dictated this the chief clerk made
a hurried exit from the room and had a long
talk with his boss the master mechanic

  when brown in the course of time re-
turned to his own office his stenographer
was not there neither was her picture hat
nor her deadly hatpins nor her paper cuffs
nor anything else that was hers

  on his desk however mr brown found
this message written on a telegraph form

   dear sir 

     replying to yours of even date i beg to state
   that though my friend already regards herself
   as fired yet she will meet you this pm at four
   oclock at the first presbyterian church of
   bristol tennessee to receive the formal notice
   of dismissal as per your favor of this date

  at  pm that january day of  the
ten thousand miles by rail



ceremony took place when i arrived at
bristol in february they were just the hap-
piest couple in all virginia

  proctor brown chief clerk to the master
mechanic hadthen in his employ the slow-
est-speeded typewriting artist in tennessee
and his speech was now like unto the drawl
of mark twain

   the chief clerk to the master mechanic was
giving his dictating apparatus a holiday

couple no 

   bristol the scene of the romance just nar-
rated is one of the most popular of all th
gretna greens on southern railway lines

  the main street is part of the boundary
line of virginia and tennessee thereby giv-
ing the town the distinction of being half

                           in one state and
         	half in the other

                        most everybody
                        down there writes
                        the address like
                        this bristol

did the spot-
light man inflict
the torture

virginia-tennessee

the  wizard of the
bristol gretna green 
is parson burroughs at
the time that i visited bris-
tol his books showed a total
of over  couples who
were wedded in his parson-
age

  the chief reason for the use of
bristol as a gretna green is this

under the virginia laws consent of
parents is needed up to a certain age
while under the tennessee laws you
may marry at any old time without con-
sulting the wishes of pop or mother

  naturally rev burroughss parsonage
is on the tennessee side of bristols main
street and a number of his patrons are
brides wishing to be joined in
wedlock to railway men espe-
cially those of the norfolk and
western the southern railway
the virginia and southwestern
and the virginian railway all
of which meet at bristol

just before i reached bristol

parson burroughs married cou-

  now said the good man after no
 had departed just one more happy
pair and ill round out an even thirty-two
hundred

  hardly had parson burroughs spoken
than-buzz buzz sounded through the par-
sonage the electric door-bell was ringing

  the housemaid flew to the door and pres-
ently ushered into the parsons study a blush-
ing bride-to-be and an anxious-looking
groom-to-be both from virginia of course
she was a railroad girl and he a norfolk
and western operator from rocky mount

   pearsey mcneil said parson burroughs
do you take this woman- margaret
partlow do you take this man- 

  i do

   amen  concluded the parson  and
now my children he added youre no
 of which perhaps over a thousand
were like yourselves railway folks and i
allow that when i make the record public
brother evans over at elizabeth city will
be somewhat astonished at the figures

the elizabeth city to which the good
parson burroughs referred was a second
gretna green for couples from virginia this
rival town being just over the boundary in
north carolina on the atlantic coast line


the railroad mans magazine

  it also happened that on the very same
night on which couple no  came to
parson burroughs another couple in railway
life appeared at the elizabeth city gretna
green to be united by parson evans

  this couple had come down from nor-
folk the groom being keeling thomas
manager of the norfolk news company
and the bride was lotta lowery

  they really had no need to elope for the
parents on both sides had given their con-
sent and everything was lovely but they
ran away all the same-from the great num-
ber of their railroad friends

  because when the railroad men of norfolk
had learned that the manager of the norfolk
news company intended to marry pretty
lotta lowery they prepared to celebrate the
occasion with a big noise they secured
scores of pots and pans and cowbells horns
and whistles and firecrackers were also
brought into the program they planned
a noise that would have made the battle of
manila but the cheeping of a spring robin

  hearing of all these preparations the
bride-elect said to the groom-elect

   lets give them the slip lets fly to the
gretna green at elizabeth city 

  thats why they appeared at the parsonage
of rev evans

   but well get em yet said the rail-
roaders at the norfolk station theyre
returning here to-night and it has been
announced that they will occupy a box at the
colonial theater well get em all right
that night at the colonial theater the
spot-light man had orders to train his light
directly on the bride the moment she ap-
peared in the box and to keep it on her
during the entire show

  then too one of the comedians was given
a ballad written by one of the bridegrooms
friends entitled  when the boss of the
newsbutchers came back with his bride
thirdly all the instruments of noise were
distributed among the railway men and others
in the audience the plan being to let loose
the din the moment the boss of the news-
butchers  appeared in the theater

  did the spot-light man inflict the torture
did the comedian sing his ballad did the
audience unleash the noises

  no the boss of the newsbutchers
and his bride went to another theater

  the audience the spot-light man and the
theatrical company cried as one man

 stung 

  meantime parson burroughs at the bris-
tol gretna green had made public the fact

that he had joined couple no  in holy
wedlock and he felt sure that brother evans
ar elizabeth city would gasp with aston-
ishment

   only thirty-two hundred exclaimed the
elizabeth city parson upon hearing the news
 dull marriage market over there at bristol
now my city has a record to date of over
four thousand wedding ceremonies performed
for couples from virginia including per-
haps some fifteeg hundred brides of railroad
men

  and all bristol cried as one man
stung

the bet she lost

  the senate of georgia sat in solemn con-
clave listening to a speech by one of the
 cracker  senators on  why the railroads
of jojah suh should be pushed into the
atlantic ocean or something to that effect
when suddenly one of the listeners after
looking up to the visitors gallery whispered
to his nearest colleague

   that young lady up there suh is the
daughter of the general passenger agent of
the seaboard air line here in atlanta our
friends invectives against the railroads prob-
ably interest her exceedingly

   whats more answered the colleague
 shes the granddaughter of general stone-
wall jackson suh and i propose to move
that we take a recess in order to do her
honor

  a quarter of an hour later after the sena-
tor had finished his harangue against the
dreadful railroads the senator who had told
his friend that the young woman in the
gallery was stonewall jacksons granddaugh-
ter arose and suggested that the senate as a
body take a recess of half an hour in honor
of the distinguished visitor

  the recess went into effect immediately
and the young lady was brought down on the
floor all smiles and blushes and filled with
astonishment

  the name of the beautiful young girl to
whom all the jojah solons now paid their
respects was miss julia jackson christian
her companion of the occasion was mr rand
preston of charlotte north carolina a
former legislator of his state and a lawyer
of prominence in his town

  that same night general passenger agent
christian of the seaboard air line at at-
lanta said to his daughter

   so you ran away to the senate to-day did
you hand in hand with preston
ten thousand miles by rail



   yes father replied miss julia  and
if you dont watch out she added with a
smile that dimpled her cheeks bewitchingly
well run still farther away and - join
hands forevermore-

   bet you ten dollars julia said mr
christian that no romantic child of mine
ever could elope and marry without my stop-
ping the proceeding-if i wanted to

 what for a wedding present

 no to pay your gambling debts didnt
 you bet me ten dollars that you would stop
 any child of yours from running away to
 marry and didnt i raise you ten twenty
 dollars please

no my dear i won that jackpot
myself

 how do you mean father

  the very next day mr christian received
a telegram reading something like this

    en route for salisbury north carolina
  will marry at midnight vou will have to
  hurry i raise your ten to twenty and play my
  hand to win with rand preston as partner

  twenty-four hours later when the happy
runaways returned to atlanta having been
marriedin salisbury in the presence of dozens
of friends who had been let into the ro-
mantic secret the bride said to her father
twenty dollars please

   i said i could stop the proceeding-if i
wanted to well i didnt want to twenty-
dollars mrs rand preston please

  and the general passenger agent of the
seaboard air line smiled grimly as the bride-
groom eagerly peeled off a twenty and handed
it to his father-in-law in behalf of the very
up-to-date railroad girl who had lost the
wager

the baltimore and ohio polar expedition

conductor leary awoke and looked out of
the frosty car window a trainman on the

handed it to his father-in-law


the railroad mans magazine

the two moshers started ahead to pick a trail
for the dogs

eleven hours-



 seat opposite woke up stretched himself
 and did the same

  the whole country looks like a picture
 out of one of pearys arctic stories said
 conductor leary

 and the snow still coming down in
sheets yawned the trainman

  we may be stalled here some hours yet
 the conductor said cheerfully its good
 there aint more women aboard

yes only two women-folks thank
heaven responded the trainman

  one of em looked like she wasnt feelin
 well when i last passed through her car
 about three oclock this morning the con-
 ductor announced

  sufferin from lack of food lack of sleep
 or lack of warmth   asked the trainman

you can search me the conductor
shrugged his shoulders in the fashion of the
pennsylvania dutch

 this occurred on train no  of the balti-
 more and ohio railroad just at daybreak

the spoton which the snow-
bound train stood was some
twelve miles north of the near-
est town that possessed enough
inhabitants to get a prominent
place on the map namely
butler-and butler was many
miles north of pittsburgh
the train had been standing on
that spot snowbound for
ver since eight
oclock the previous evening

being a local there was no
pullman the passengers had
to get rest the best way they
could on the seats of the day
coaches

                another hour passed there
wasnt anything to do except
for all hands to try to keep
warm and wait for a snow-
plow to come up from butler
and dig out the train just as conductor
learys watch announced eight oclock an
excited whisper passed from one to another
of the passengers and presently there was a
wild commotion in all the cars

  to enter into particulars it may be stated
that at exactly  am one of the two
women passengers rushed into the car in
which conductor leary and the trainman
were trying to snatch one more cat-nap and
announced that the stork had entered the
forward coach bringing a baby girl

  and the mothers got to be taken to a
hospital right away stated the herald of
awful tidings

  conductor leary was equal to any emer-
gency of railroading with all his readiness
lie spoke as follows

  madam please assure the mother and
child that they shall be transported at once
to a proper place

  he turned to his trainman saying  com
with me up to the baggage
ten thousand miles by rail



  on the way forward he continued  weve
got to fit out a polar expedition just like you
read about in pearys stories weve got to
have a sled and cushions for the sled and
dogs and harness for the dogs and mushers
whatever those are

  in the baggage-express car lear gave
orders for the men there to yank off two of
the wooden slats forming the latticed parti-
tion separating the baggage from the express

  theyll do for the runners of the sled
quoth leary

  while the men yanked off the slats leary
himself removed the screws from the hinges
of the cupboard door

  now he said with these same screws
well fasten this door to those runners

  a few minutes later as good a sled as
a peary could want in an emergency had been
constructed upon it were placed a lot of
empty mail bags for cushions then leary
pulled the bell-cord out by the roots and cut
off yards and yards of it saying

  and theres the harness for the dogs
  whos the dogs asked a trainman

   youre one of em said leary  and
the other shack will be the second dog see
that smoke there pointing through the
window-well its about three miles off
you two will have to pull this sled to that
smoke the smoke is coming out of the
chimney of a farmhouse and farmhouses
usually contain all the concomitants for a
proper reception in such a case as this

   you talked about needing mushers what-
ever those are said one of the trainmen who
was to play dog  wholl be the mushers  
 i will be one musher said a traveling
auditor ofthe-baltimore and ohio who had
come into the baggage-car to get away from
the wild excitement of the coaches

    ill be a musher too said a traveling
inspector of the baltimore and ohio

  the sled was launched upon the beautiful
snow and the mother and child were tenderly
carried out and laid upon it the two
trainmen got into the bell-rope harness ready
to pull for the big smoke the two mushers
started ahead to pick a trail for the dogs
 pear- himself couldnt do better said
conductor leary complacently  but look
here he added turning to the mother
where does your friend hail from i must
report this increase of population and i need
exact details

  shes from a place called frost and was
on her way to butler she replied

  frost eh ive an idea cried leary
whats the matter with this train - crew

adopting this kid right here and now and
naming it frostie in honor of the town its
mother hails from frostie listens kinder
girlish doesnt it all right frostie let
it be and i move that this crew -here
waving his hand to the engineer the fireman
the two trainmen and the two traveling rail-
road men-i move that we railroaders give
three cheers for miss frostie and that here-
with too we pledge miss frostie the pro-
tection of this train-crew as long as a man
of us shall live

  hooray hooray hooray cried all
the crew swinging their caps in the air and
letting the snow fall upon their bared heads

  youre off yelled conductor leary
 youre the first polar expedition ever sent
out by the baltimore and ohio

  for a long time after that whenever a
baltimore and ohio man met mrs mary
debeur at the station at frost pennsylvania
he would ask

  and hows our little miss frostie

 mother allen

  a box-car minus its trucks stood near the
railroad tracks and in it lived the best-known
railroad girl on the delaware division of the
pennsy

  the car stood there for fifty years and
was removed only two years ago it was the
first freight-car run over the division and
was presented by the railroad to a section
foreman named edward allen away back in


  allen died in  his widow amanda
allen is the heroine of this tale covering a
half-century of life in the famous box-car at
seaford delaware

  during that time she first sistered and
later  mothered the men connected with
the railroad between clayton and cape
charles

  when amanda allen and her husband
first took possession of the home presented to
them by the railroad company they opened
a grocery store in one end of the car and
established living quarters in the other end
allen grew rich had no use for banks and
stored his money in chests in the car thus
he left his widow considerable funds in
hand

  seven children were born to them in the
car and all were brought up to manhood
and womanhood within that unique home

  whenever a railroad man of the delaware
division got into trouble he went to  sister
allen  for advice and sometimes for more


the railroad mans magazine

substantial help-which he invariably re-
ceived

  every christmas and also on their birth-
days  sister allen  remembered the boys
with useful presents railroaders who lived
at seaford and were taken sick were nursed
by  sister allen

  no she said this car is dear to me
it has many precious memories ill not
leave it besides if i moved into a real
house the railroad men would not feel privi-
leged to drop in as they do now whenever
they need a helping hand ill stay here
toward the end of her life one of  mother
allens own sons and two of her railway
sons anxious to see her settled in a real

they opened a grocery-store in one end
of the car

  when her husband died sister allen
was then sixty-four years old the day
after the funeral of her life-mate a track-
walker was seriously hurt and she had him
brought into her box car where she nursed
him back to health

  it was he who changed the title of sister
to that of  mother and from that time the
railroad men called her mother allen

  it then came to pass that her children and
her railroad sons began begging her to buy
a more comfortable home for her old age

house such as she could wqll afford to buy
made these amusing announcements

   i will never get my hair cut again
mother allen said one of the railroad sons
until you move out of this car

  and i said a second cutting the top
button from his coat will never permit this
button to be sewed on again nor will i buy
a new coat until you move

   and i said edward allen her own son
 will go away and be an actor unless you
consent at once to move
ten thousand klles by rail



  but  mother allen  still refused to
budge one railroad sons hair grew down
his back and the second sons coat con-
tinued buttonless at the top and the real
son edward went away as he had threat-
ened to do and became an actor in ethel
barrymores company

  suddenly in may  mother allen
at length surrendered she declared that if
only edward would come home she would
move into a real house

  a few days later edward allen then in
illinois received this telegram

   come at once mother will move into a
  fine house to-morrow 

  edward was prosperous nevertheless he

left the stage and hastened to seaford dela-
ware to remain there long enough to see his
mother installed in her new home

  he arrived at his home town and hurried
to the box car a large number of people
gathered around including every railroad
man who had been able to get off duty

  crape hung from the side of the box car
carriages stood in line behind a hearse in
which pallbearers were placing a casket

  the next day the son with the long hair
went to the barber the second son got one
of his sisters to sew the top button on his
coat and edward allen resigned from the
theatrical company and stayed in seaford

   mother allen  had moved to a new
and better home in another world

international railroad board

steps have been taken by the united states
and canada toward the creation of a joint
international railroad commission for the control
and regulation of international freight and passen-
ger rates between the two countries it is regard-
ed as the most important step taken in many years
in furtherance of the cordial relation between these
two countries and is taken also as an indication of
the spirit with which the united states and canada
are to work out their question of reciprocity this is
the first formal move ever made in this country to-
ward the regulation of international railroad rates

  the preliminary step taken by the two govern-
ments consists in the appointment of martin a
knapp chairman of the united states interstate
commerce commission and j p mabee chairman
of canadas railroad commission as a committee
to consider the advisability of the creation of such
a commission the two chairmen are to meet at
an early date and report back to their governments
there is little doubt in washington that they will
report in favor of the international commission

  the actual creation of the commission will be
the result either of the treaty agreement between the
two countries or of concurrent legislation by the
countries or possibly both

  if an international commission results it will be
composed partly of canadians and partly of ameri-
cans the powers possessed by the railroad com-
mission of canada are broader and more compre-
hensive than those now possessed by the american
commission the canadian railroad commission
it is said is practically able to fix rates but the

power of the international commission as applied
to american roads would have to fall considerably
short of this

  such a movement would develop railroad traffic
between canada and the united states the traffic
over the border especially in minnesota and other
northwestern states has been increasing by bounds
in the last few years and it is the belief that the
near future will see a further marked development
in this direction

  the interstate commerce commission of the
united states and the canadian railroad commis-
sion acting individually practically control inter-
national rates between the two countries the in-
terstate commerce commission in the case of a
rate over an american road to a point in canada
compels the railroad to file not only the rate to the
point of destination but the proportion of the rate
charged to the border the commission thus in-
sists upon the rate to the border being just and rea-
sonable and the railroad commission of canada
exercises its power after the road crosses the line

  under present conditions of individual effort
however neither the united states commission nor
the canadian commission has been able to compel
the maintenance of through or joint rates to inter-
national points it is in this connection that rail-
road experts expect the greatest benefits to flow
from a working agreement between the two govern-
ments the tlirough rates to canadian points in
most instances now arc made up chiefly of the
aggregate of local rates which are said to be higher
than through rates would be

when odonnell stood pat

by marion patten lindsley

           a colossal game of bluff in which sheer
           nerve and a stiff upper lip saved the day

ill i accept it   said
  odonnell excitedly
  putting a pair of his
  wifes stockings into his
  suit-case by mistake and
  seizing a couple of col-
  lars and some handkerchiefs

   i will  would it suit my convenience
to report to mr davis in chicago on tues-
day afternoon    would it suit my conveni-
ence  well if they wire just tell them all
you saw was the streak i made as i hit the
pike for the depot to get there

    would i accept the position at four
thousand a year  would i would i turn
somersaults all the way to chicago to get the
raise  

   here william odonnell said his wife

 you go sit down somewhere and get hold of
your emotions while i pack this suit-case
what use are you expecting to have for a pair
of my hose and two jabots 

  he mopped his brow and paced the room
nervously until she finished packing then
he threw his hat on his head where it sat
jauntily askew seized the suit-case and started

  now remember william not to spend
any more money than you can help called
his better half cheerfully from the front door

 its all we have to see us through this months
bills it doesnt seem really necessary that
you should take eighty dollars with you it
ought not to cost you over twenty at the
very most if watkins presses for payment
ill simply have to wire you for money

  well you wire and ill send it at once

   a good woman maria thought he  but
a little too close to be real broad-minded his
money went with irish indifference to saving
and he was always in high feather while it
lasted though often lost in wonder as to what
had become of it when it was gone some-
times he was disheartened and blue for as



long as three or four hours over the depletion
of the exchequer

   then it was that maria always proved her
value as a helpmate for she brought out loose
change from some hidden place or showed
him a balance on her bank-book which cov-
ered the deficit and enabled them to worry
along until the next salary day

  maria was slow but sure and steady
when bill saw a thing he wanted he went
after it in leaps and bounds and somersaults
often in his enthusiasm he fell over the de-
sired object and rolled on beyond it while
some calmer and better balanced individual
picked it up behind him maria however
always approached the object of her desires
in a conventional jog-trot and by an orthodox
and well-traveled route on arriving she
often found that some one less painstaking as
to methods had reached it by a short cut and
that there was nothing left for her but dis-
appointment

  but both were philosophical though in
ways as widely different as their personal ap-
pearance bill was short rotund and mercu-
rial with a twinkle of recklessness in the
shrewd gray eyes that laughed out at the world
engagingly maria was angular tall melan-
choly and had a peculiar set to her chin that
frightened children

  on the way to chicago bill read a dozen
times or more the letter offering him the posi-
tion with the overland pacific it was a rare
streak of luck he was thrilled with excite-
ment to think that at last he was to meet davis
the man who had arrived at die heights
whither he was feebly striving

  he had always regarded davis with awe
and reverence and it would be quite a won-
derful thing to meet him and give him one or
two of the really good ideas he had for the
betterment of the road ideas that had been
formulating in his brain for months
when odonnell stood pat



 after all four thousand a year wasnt so
 much davis no doubt got treble that
amount possibly more if he could make
them raise it to five thousand maria could
have that house she had wanted to live in
so long there could be a new rug for the
parlor and really the girls were getting at an
age where they liked nice furnishings when
their young men called he had a vision of
their joy as he came in and carelessly an-
nounced 

    well girls how about that new rug for
the parlor maria better pick
out a fine one to fit the floor of
that seventh street house while
you are about it

  nan you might see about
trading in your old piano for a
new one

    alice did you say something
about wanting art lessons this
winter 

   myra you may take that
trip to chicago with your chum
ifyou want to

   he beamed with such satisfac-
tion that the wry face of a sour-
looking woman across the aisle
relaxed into a sympathetic smile
and she offered him her paper
to read his mind wandered
from its columns to the things
maria and the girls would have

   privately he did hot yearn to
hear music as for art when
alice with a soulful expression
had once asked him what he
thought of the flesh-tint values
of a bouguereau his sole ex-
clamation had been a shocked

gosh but he loved his wife
and daughters and liked to
have them take an interest in
culture they were warm-
hearted loyal folk and he was
proud of their little accomplishments and suc-
cesses and proudest of all that they loved
him

  his mind wandered back to davis why
was it he wondered that davis should be at
the top and he only a tenth way up  a head-
line in the paper struck his gaze- the
american game of bluff

   suddenly he remembered a friend of daviss
saying to him once no wonder he got there
odonnell why that man can bluff through
on a pair of deuces as if thy were four aces
stand pat and get away with the whole jack-
pot

  his active imagination gripped a new idea
and wrestled with it all the remainder of the
trip he left the train with as happy a smile
as though the eighty dollars in his pocket was
not all the ready cash he had in the world and
ensconced himself in the bus of the most ex-
pensive hotel in the city on arriving he
walked into the building as if he owned it

   give me the best suite of rooms you have
lie said to the clerk in an offhand manner

   the royal suite is empty but it is twenty-
five dollars a day- 

  odonnell flung down two twenty-dollar
bills and a ten

   call a bellhop he said shortly  can
a man get any service in this hotel or cant

he

  in an instant the clerk and several servants
were buzzing about him at last he was left
alone with a little  suit-case in the midst
of sybaritic splendor he walked around
looking at the pictures and feeling the plush
of the furniture he noticed that the suit-
case reposed on a costly inlaid table snatched
it off and wandered about looking at the
details of the apartments in his admiring


the railroad mans magazine

and awestricken amblings he encountered his
image in a pier-glass

  gosh what would maria say he in-
quired of it the image received the query
with a look of solemn wonder which changed
rapidly to nervous anxiety he fixed it with
a disgusted frown which gradually melted
away under the warmth of the twinkle in his
eyes

    billy odonnell he said chuckling  if
davis could you can too anyhow youre
going to stand pat and get a heap of fun out
of it so who cares  

  seating himself at the mahogany desk he
inscribed a brief note to mr davis informing
him that he william p odonnell was at

the - hotel would be too busy to see

him that evening expected to be very much
engaged the following morning but would
be pleased to see him at two the following
afternoon if he would call

  he perused the note with interest dis-
patched it and set about killing time until
the appointed hour cheery but with many
grave misgivings twice he had to restrain
an almost unconquerable impulse to go look
davis up in a meek and humble spirit be-
fitting the situation and express his abject
willingness to accept the proffered position

   at a quarter before two the next afternoon
he ordered a box of the finest cigars the hotel
afforded stuffing half a dozen of them into
his pocket he placed the box conspicuously
on the center table the next fifteen minutes
went like hours as the clock on the mantel
pointed at two he began smoking to quiet his
nerves at three minutes past two mr daviss
card was brought to him by a gloomy-faced
bellboy

   very good he said putting a dollar in
the boys hand very good just tell the
gentleman i am busily engaged on some highly
important matters and will be at leisure in ten
minutes ask him to wait and bring him up
in ten minutes or so theres another dollar
where that came from if you dont let him get
away

  im on said the boy with a wink

  odonnell seated himself in front of the
clock

  well will that ten minutes ever pass
he asked himself anxiously what if he
should go he started for the bell but re-
strained himself and paced the room back and
forth back and forth four minutes five
minutes six minutes seven-

  the strain was too much and as the eighth
minute passed he seized the phone and asked
to have his caller brought up to him

  while pacing back and forth waiting he
saw two prosperous looking men pass his open
door from a room just beyond they met
davis and the bellboy just as they turned the
corner into the corridor one of them he
recognized as the president of the north cen-
tral railroad whom he knew by sight he
noticed that davis bowed and turned to stare
after them with a peculiar expression on his
face and the thought flashed through his
mind that they would naturally be supposed
to have come from his rooms

  he met davis with outstretched hand and
they sized each other up with quick shrewd
glances strange to say he was perfectly cool
and indifferent now that the crisis was upon
him davis was puzzled and interested

   sorry to have kept you waiting ex-
plained odonnell with magnetic winsome-
ness  but it was unavoidable have a cigar 
daviss eyebrows went up a trifle as he
noted the name on the box and took in the
expensive overelegance of the suite he set-
tled himself comfortably in an easychair
facing odonnell who at once plunged into
the main subject between them

  now mr davis about your offer-the
assistant attorneyship wasnt it i fear you
and i will not be able to agree you spoke in
your note of a salary of four thousand a year
daviss gaze went around the apartments
and back to the cigar box he smoked a
much cheaper brand himself

  from what we heard of you we thought
you would about fit the position and that the
position would about fit you

  odonnell smiled enigmatically  i have
a family to support he said and laughed
good-naturedly

  davis blew some rings of smoke ceilingward
before he answered his mind was busily
trying to readjust itself to the unexpected dis-
covery that odonnell was a wealthier and
a higher grade man than he had thought to
find him the rooms must cost twenty or thirty
a day and evidently he smoked the expensive
cigars before them commonly as a number
were gone from the box he looked like the
sort of a man who would regard such luxuries
merely as an incident he assuredly was no
sybarite he had every appearance of being a
sharp reliable forceful business man with
horse sense he had the reputation of being
thoroughly posted on railroad law and of
having almost a genius for persuasion

   i heard you had some ideas about the
joint freight rates on the overland suggested
davis tentatively

   yes it is a pet way of mine to utilize
when odonnell stood tat



my spare time in studying over the railroad
needs and interests your road is losing a
good many dollars every month on that joint
freight arrangement i have worked out a
classification that will save you a lot of
money 

 yes

  yes 

 the two men eyed each other in silence a

 right here-that is all but the social part of
 it i have various interests and as you may
 have noticed i am a busy man with a num-
 ber of irons in the fire lately candidly i
 like the overland the best of all the roads and
 would like to work to advance its interests
 and protect them several inside facts have
 enabled me to study out plans for increasing
 its revenues materially they are plans which

it is twenty

moment the rings of smoke curling up and
vanishing one by one

    what is your idea  

    it is one which i should put into opera-
tion at once if i were given the authority to
do so

   i see well how does five thousand a
year strike you odonnell   i am not author-
ized to offer you more than the four but
frankly i think you are the man we want
there have been a number of changes lately
in connection with our road there would be
chances for promotion for you if you make
good as i have no doubt you will our present
attorney might resign in fact that may be
more imminent than is generally sunpcsed
if that is your idea mr davis i fear
our interview might just as well terminate

could perhaps be used by the north central
or some other road equally well

  davis eyed him a moment the fine net-
work of wrinkles about his eyes meeting the
deep lines at the corners of his thin-lipped
mouth odonnell noticed that while he was
tall well-built and prosperous looking he had
the worn jaded appearance of a man who had
lived much on the edge of his nerves

   what would you say to a salary of five
thousand  

   i should laugh at it and dismiss it from
my mind replied odonnell airily have
another cigar and put some of them in your
pocket if you like them this box seems
rather better than usual they are my favor-
ite brand

   about what asked davis warily

the royal suite is empty but
dollars a day


the railroad mans magazine

  davis went to the window
  stood a moment looking out
  and came back with out-
  stretched hand

   frankly i am sorry to lose
  you odonnell you are the
  man for us i am sure we
  thought this all out carefully
  and agreed not to exceed the
  amount mentioned

   oh well said odonnell
  graciously life is full of
  these little unadjustable things
  it has been a treat to meet you
  mr davis and if i can serve
  you personally at any time it
  will be a pleasure

  they shook hands odon-
  nell permitted a little regret to
  creep into his cool smiling ex-
  pression-gracious regret at his
  inability to accommodate in
  daviss eyes shone a gleam of
  strong admiration

c if  kxir	 	when the door closed after

j		davis odonnell started to

call him back and had to catch

  hold of the center - table with
f -v  both hands to hold himself

  the quick impulse conquered
  j	he sank onto a sofa and kicked

   all the gilt off one of its legs

 j	 you worse than fool he

  groaned  with your airy re-
  i could not think of less than ten thousand a year fusal of the biggest salary

                                                           youve ever had offered to you
 about what would be your idea of an amount youd best use a little sense and go after
that would make it worth while	him and tell him youll take what he chooses

  well i could not think of less than ten to give
thousand a year answered the mercurial he had a flash of intuition

billy carried away with himself	 no you cant do even that now if you

   um-m that is all our attorney is get- climb down hell despise you and not want
ting daviss inward thoughts were not per- you at any price

ceptible on his well-controlled countenance	 oh gosh what will maria say i wont

   i could materially increase the revenues tell maria there are some things a woman
of the road	never can understand anyhow it isnt neces-

  davis rose to his feet and stood in thought- sary to tell em everything maria knows im
ful silence a moment or two and then said a fool without a ground plan front elevation
well mr odonnell i am sorry we can- to that effect being sketched out and presented
not agree in this matter if you change your to her by me

mind let me know during the evening	he walked to the window and stood looking

   it is not likely i shall change mr davis out for ten minutes then wandered back to the
your call has been very enjoyable even if sofa again and seated himself in a little
we do not agree on all points the interests hunched-up bunch in one corner of it his
of your road are nearer my heart than those thoughts were neither lucid nor consolatory
of an- other and if you find you can meet my after a quarter of an hour he went to the
terms it would be a delight to serve you i table and smoked furiously for thirty minutes
will not make other arrangements-not to-day by that time his nerves were so unstrung that
at least	he could sit nowhere and he began pacing
when odonnell stood pat



the floor suddenly he encountered in the
pier-glass a queer round little figure of a man
with a countenance of deepest wo he
stared at his image in silence and shook his
fist at it then he burst into invective

  you would would you you addlepated
inbecile you took a flier didnt you just
because you hadnt brains enough to weight
you down if you will go up in an air-ship
of idiocy you must expect to take a hard fall
and get your little fool vanity bruised some
he walked the length of the room and came
back to make faces at the reflection in the
mirror  there are just three classes of fools
my son he expounded gravely

  there are congenital fools accidental
fools and just plain damfools you my
bright boy have proved your indisputable
right to be the leader of the third class

  he rumpled up his gray hair and smiled
with deep pity at the wild-looking figure in the
glass

  no wonder he sighed no wonder
you are suffering with an acute attack of
megalocephalitus complicated with ingrowing
nerve and there was no surgeon near to oper-
ate and reduce the swelling in your head in
time to save you no wonder youre gone

   youre a dead one my boy youre com-
mercially and financially and particularly
dead with nobody coinin to the funeral no-
body that is but maria

  this last thought added to
the gravity of his expression in
a marked degree he resumed
his restless pacing back and
forth

  you play a pair of deuces
as if they were four aces huh

youve played the deuce all
right youve raised for your-
self what william allen white
says they raise in kansas youll
just have to munch your crop
my long - eared silky - haired
friend whether you like it or
not

  william parnell odonnell
youre a sixty - horse - power
silver - plated double - riveted
mile - a - minute honker thats
what you are the geese and
donkeys just run to die under
your tires because they recog-
nize their brother they do

   youve thrown away not
only your own chances but ma-
rias new home and alices
art lessons and myras trip and

nans piano-thats what youve done all
those innocent women have to suffer because
of your asininity arent you proud of your-
self arent you

   its all because this gilt and plush and
paintings and folderol went to the weakest
spot in you and addled your brains though it
is only by courtesy one would call whats in
your head brains 

  he sat down and tried to compose his
thoughts and study the way out of the situa-
tion but ail hours deep meditation failed to
bring forth any inspiration it all came back
to the same thing he could go to davis and
eat humble pie and be coldly refused or at
best be taken on at the original offer of four
thousand though for this last he had no hope
feeling that his apparent prosperity and in-
difference were what had won and held davis

  two hours later he was still lost in painful
thought when a sharp rap at the door aroused
him he had just opened his mouth to call
 come  when the door opened and a mis-
chievous face peeped in it was lighted by
bright brown eyes and surmounted by an a
d t cap

  ye gods the telegram from maria wat-
kins had demanded that his bill be paid and
had refused to wait truly misfortunes were
thick upon him he just turned and walked
to the window and stood looking out sad and


	the railroad mans magazine

disheartened for well he knew that he had
not now the wherewithal to meet watkinss
demand in a moment it penetrated to his
consciousness that the room was very silent
he turned in time to see the boy stuffing
cigars out of the box into his pocket he
swooped down on him

    here you  he yelled wrathfully  that
will be about all for you you young limb
grabbing him firmly by the collar he liter-
ally shook him loose from the cigars but if
he looked for repentance or terror he was
doomed to surprise

  one look at odonnells jolly face made
the boy feel that he was not going to be pun-
ished  unhand muh  he cried im-
pudently his head on one side  hah
wouldst do muh harm muh the sole sup-
port of a widowed mother and her orfling
cheild  

   your widowed mother ought to take her
orfle child across her knee and spank him
said odonnell disgustedly  the idea of
a kid like you smoking its bad enough for
a man my age dont you know what they do
with boys that snoop around taking other
folkss belongings that way the police get
em ive a mind to see that they get you

   oh i say now mister you wouldnt be
so mean to a poor little feller what has to
hustle fer a livin would you begged the
boy now thoroughly scared i never took
nothin before sellup me when i came
into this room and saw all this gorgeousity
and splendiferousness it kind of went to my
head it did

  odonnells face softened the gor-
geousity and splendiferousrtess  had gone to
his head too why should he be hard on a
fellow weakling 

  when i sees them thirty-dollar-a-box
cigars- 

   the rest of the sentence was lost on odon-
nell merciful goodness thirty dollars a
box they were not yet paid for he had not
thought to ask the price and he hadnt thirty
dollars left he began some lightning calcu-
lations his watch would bring the amount

perhaps that would be needed for a graceful
exit from the hostelry

   but watkins this thought brought the
unwelcome message from maria to his mind
he took it up from the table but deferred the
misery of reading it to listen to the boys re-
marks which were still fluent

  an i dont smoke em meself not muh
i did onct an i didnt eat fer a week sos
things would stay down where they was put
i gets em when i can an i gives em to the
manager its just me little graft

   when i turns me flashlights onto all this
gold and them thirty-a-box cigars odonnell
winced painfully i says to meself  heres
one of them multimillionaires that throws
around five-dollar bills fer tips an the
thought of the five dollars you was goin to
give me and all the rest of it sort of went to
me head it did that message is fer you
mister an im to wait fer the answer
odonnell opened the missive slowly read
it straightened up with a wondering grin
read it again and gave a war-whoop of pure
joy he went to the window and stood look-
ing out the perspiration had formed in
beads on his forehead though the room was
quite cool he wiped his brow several times
during the evolution of an answer seating
himself at the desk he dashed off a note and
handed it to the boy

   wait i want to send a telegram too 
he thought deeply trying to compose a mes-
sage that would meet marias approval and
he succeeded admirably breaking out only on
the last word it read as follows

  mrs william p odonnell atchison
   kansas 

    appointed attorney overland pacific salary-
   ten thousand a year whoopee

  he mopped his brow again as he watched
the door close behind the boy to whom he
had recklessly given a five-dollar bill

   well he murmured limply with an-
other flash of intuition  if daviss bluffs
carried him through such hours of particular
hades as mine has me i wonder if he thinks
the games worth the candle
with the boys of the northwest

by m  g roche

when james j hill began railroading in the great northwest he stirred
things up mightily it is the nature of this big progressive man to  keep
things on the move and many are the tales that are told about him
although he figures in some that mr roche has set down here there are other
live ones of western railroading some dating back to those exciting days when
the great northern and the northern pacific first pushed their steel noses into
the puget sound country	

still in the game-thought he was dreaming-the irish special-hill had
resigned-the death of  checks and other
good ones

uring the villard regime on
the northern pacific t f
oakes was his right - hand
man he succeeded villard
to the presidency and had di-
rect charge of the operation
of the road villard was a financier and
oakes an operating man under the latters
management the northern pacifics develop-
ment was something wonderful

  what was once a stretch of barren country
reaching from st paul on the east to portland
on the west became a series of hamlets vil-
lages towns and cities many of the last
named growing to metropolitan proportions
and peopled by the very best bone and sinew
not only of our own country but of those who
have come from abroad

  back in the early eighties when oakes and
hill headed the two great northern trans-
continental lines the competition was more
than keen each move of the other was
watched with hawklike eyes and every effort
made by the one to circumvent the other

  agreements would be signed one day only
to be broken the next this grew to such a
pass that ofttimes the ink of a signed agree-
ment would not be dry before it was broken

  it is said that the agreements between the
traffic and operating officials were of such
little weight that finally mr hill and mr
oakes themselves came together for the pur-

pose of settling some knotty problem an
agreement was soon reached and duly signed
lo and behold the very next day the north-
ern pacific president discovered his agree-
ment was no more binding than one made by
the general freight-agent

  forthwith according to the story oakes
sought hill in his private office and a
stormy interview was the result as they
were about to separate mr oakes said to
mr hill his steel-gray eyes fairly emitting
sparks of fire

   mr hill i never knew before sir that
you were such a liar

  mr oakes replied the ever-ready j j
 i never knew before sir that you were such
a fool as to believe me

  and then they separated

  since those days mr oakes has retired to
private life having amassed a fortune in
wall street after quitting railroad work
mr hill however continues in the game
and to-day his position as a railroad ruler
needs no emphasizing

j

thought he  was dreaming

hphere is a good story told on joe mc-
cabe now a prominent railroad con-
tractor in the east mccabe was for years
division superintendent of the northern pa-


the railroad mans magazine

cific and afterward vice-president and gen-
eral manager of the washington and colum-
bia river road now a part and parcel of the
northern pacific when general manager of
the washington road mccabe traveled in
his private car

  side-tracked one da when inspecting
some construction work mccabe stood on
the rear platform smoking a two-bit cigar
as was his custom after a heart dinner

  along came a tramp a weary willie a
dusty rhoads a veritable hobo he sized
up mccabe and his car and then said
wats de chance guv of gettin sumtin
to eat

  after a moments thought joe said  good
come in  and turning to his porter said
 charley give this gentleman something to
eat-give him just what you gave me

  accordingly the soup was brought in then
the fish entree and some salad followed by
the roast and all things else which go to
make up the dinner of a hearty eater for
such was the genial general manager

   when his grace of the road had eaten his
fill and drunk until he could drink no more
he stepped onto the platform picking his
teeth with a quill toothpick as he cleared
the doorway the irrepressible mccabe took
a two-bit cigar from his pocket and handing
it to his guest said

  have a smoke sir

  as the tramp lighted it and turned away
joe said

  take another and smoke it later
without as much as thank you the
tramp stepped from the platform to the
ground walking half the length of the car
he sat on an embankment he puffed at that
cigar until it grew so short that he had to
stick a pin in it to keep from burninghis
fingers so anxious was he not to lose a parti-
cle of the fragrant weed

  when the pin grew so hot that he could
hold it no longer he lighted the other and
with his elbows on his knees and his chin
in his hands he neither looked to right nor
left but slowly puffed puffed puffed

  once again he resorted to the pin in
time that again grew too warm and what
was left of the cigar and the pin dropped to
the ground between his poorly covered feet

without as much as winking an eyelash he
sat there with his face still in his hands and
his elbows still on his knees he looked to
neither right nor left finally mccabe said
 are you sick

  without looking up or shifting his po-
sition in the least the tramp said

   ill bet five hunred to a doughnut dat
i wake up in five minutes

creaking of general managers there is
 one in portland who is rapidlydraw-
ing to himself the attention of the railroad
world he is j p obrien and like many
another railway manager has risen from the
ranks and is in every sense of the word a
self-made man

  as every one knows the private cars of
railway officials are known by a name or
number the car of the general manager of
the harriman lines is numbered   and is
known as such

  several years ago when drake oreilly
was assistant general freight - agent of the
oregon railroad and navigation he went
out with mr obrien to attend an important
meeting at lagrande in eastern oregon
the car was of course side-tracked during
their stay there and as is the custom was
inspected as the inspector was overhauling
the trucks and brakes and all such things be-
neath the car a car-whacker happened by

hill had resigned

tt is frequently said that railroad men han-
die the truth with economy and that it
is as natural for them to twist a meaning as
it is fof them to eat be that as it may
there is one man i know-and he is one of-
the most prominent railroad men in the coun-
try-who can be as careful in expenditure
of that commodity when he believes the
occasion requires it as any one i have ever
met

  before the completion of the canadian pa-
cific along the north shore of lake superior
all its business moved via st paul and st
vincent using the tracks of what was then
the st paul minneapolis and manitoba at
the time j j hill was president of the road
and also a director of c p r i was at
that time railroad editor of the st paul
pioneer press

  one evening we had an associated press
telegram saying mr hill had resigned as
a director of the canadian pacific of
course as he lived in st paul there had to
be some local corroboration

  accordingly i called at mr hills resi-
with the boys of the northwest



dence i found him with conrad gotzian
the shoe man they were great cronies as
i entered the room mr hill said

   what can i do for you roche  

i understand mr hill was my reply
that you resigned from the c p directory
nothing in it said the most prominent
railroad man in those parts then and to-day
one of the most prominent in the country

   but mr hill-

   i tell you roche there is nothing in it
i have not only not resigned but further-
more i have no intention of resigning
finally he gave me the opportunity of tell-
ing him i had an associated press despatch
which said he had resigned

   let me see it said he he read it
carefully and handing it back to me said
with a smile childlike and bland well it
is true i have resigned

an educated dog

tdoor old checks is dead checks
was a dog of the dandie dinmont
breed and a more faithful friend never drew
the breath of life checks belonged to jim
wright of the b and o t company he
was more than a dog and knew more than
many gifted with speech

  checks was a wonder he could do every-
thing but talk jim was a fool to continue
checking baggage when he had such an asset
as checks to such a man as p t barnum
checks would have been a mint he could
do any sum in arithmetic-addition sub-
traction or multiplication he could tell the
time of day your age pick out spurious coin
from that coined at one of the united states
mints and at cards he was a corker jim
was ready at all times to wager that checks
would win three games of casino out of every
five he played no matter who might play the
opposite hand

  how did he do it

   dont know nor did any one else unless
it was jim and he would never tell

  many a time have i seen jim put a num-
ber of pieces of fractional currency on the
floor and then say

   checks suppose i gave you a half-dol-
lar and told you to go out and purchase two
and a half pounds of steak at ten cents the
pound how much change would you bring
back to me  

  without a moments hesitation checks
would pick up the twenty-five-cent piece and
lay it at his feet

  his sums in arithmetic were done by
means of playing-cards which had the fig-
ures  to  pasted on the face these would
be laid on the floor in any old way and the
answers to the problems propounded to him
he would indicate by picking up the correct
cards

  in the same way he would tell the time
many a time have i shown him my watch
and to the minute he would tell the time the
hands indicated the first time i saw him
do this trick i was going out on the o r
and n eight oclock train there were a
number of other traveling men with me i
had been telling them of checks and his
wonderful powers they laughed at me
just at that moment as luck would have it
jim came into the car with checks for the
two were inseparable companions and al-
ways traveled together

   just in time jim i said  i have been
telling these fellows about checks but they
wont believe what i say

  jim was naturally proud of checkss won-
derful attainments and always ready to show
off his faithful companion

   show him your watch said jim  and
see if he can tell you the time

  we had just cleared the steel bridge over
the willamette it was eight-ten by the
watch jim did not say another word nor
make a move so far as we could see it
was i who did the talking

  without a moments hesitation checks
picked up the  then the  and finally the
 to say that my friends were astounded
is to put it mildly indeed

  i then asked one of the party the date of
his birth and ill be hanged if checks did
not tell him his age to the very day-so many
years so many months and so many days

  jim carried with him another set of cards
instead of numbers the faces of them were
covered with the trade-marks of the various
roads represented in portland checks could
tell you what road any town in the pacific
northwest was located on

  if any one asked the most popular way to
go to chicago checks would invariably pick
up the  rock island route  card in
those days jim de bevoise was the passen-
ger representative of that road and he and
wright were great friends this probably
accounts for the dogs partiality

  poor old checkss death was very sad he
did not die a natural death he committed
suicide of this there is not the slightest
doubt for those who witnessed his death
say he deliberately went to it


the railroad mans magazine

  it was during the lewis and clark fair
travel to the exposition city was so heavy
that wright was taken off the road and sta-
tioned at the union depot his time was so
taken up by business and there was always
such a rush at the depot that jim would
leave checks at home such a life soon
grew too monotonous for the little fellow and
he would a dozen times a day make his way
to the terminal station as often as he would
come jim would send him home

   it was pitiful to see the little fellow with
his tail between his legs-you could not see
his eyes because of the long hair which cov-
ered his face-turn and do his masters bid-
ding his heart was broken for never before
did he receive such treatment

  one day he evidently determined to end it
all a train was due and the pavement in
front of the depot was lined with hotel
buses checks stood on the curbstone and
watched the weary travelers but none more
weary than he as they filled the hotel cara-
vans

  the largest and heaviest was that of the
hotel portland as it moved away a wild
yelp was heard and the next instant the rear
wheel of the heavy bus crushed out the life
of poor little checks

   that it was a deliberate suicide is vouched
for by several witnesses they declared
that checks deliberately waited until the
bus moved and then threw himself beneath
the wheel

  jim heard the cry away off in the bag-
gage-room he dropped all work and rushed
out in time to pick up the mangled remains
of the most faithful friend he had ever
known

  if there is a heaven to which good dogs
go and regrets will take one there checks
is now certainly numbered among the canine
blessed

 couldnt see the point

olonel fred h tristram as-
 sistant general passenger agent of the
wabashand one of the best-known passenger
men in the country had occasion to remark

upon the density of our cousins from across
the water

  at the time he was passing through salt
lake in the smoking compartment of the
pullman car were three others-two travel-
ing men and an english tourist one trav-
eling man was telling the other all about the
mormons-how they had made their way
into the wilderness to found a zion and be
free from the persecutions of the gentiles
how they had picked out salt lake because
of its having some physical resemblance to
the holy land how it had taken forty years
to build the temple and how each stone was
numbered so that the edifice could be re-
placed in identically the same shape else-
where should the gentiles drive them farther
west how they had carted by ox-team all
material and furniture not indigenous to the
soil across the desert in fact he told him
everything pertaining to mormonism even
unto the tenets of the faith itself

  the fellow was an interesting talker and
exceedingly well posted his talk was new
matter to the englishman and he was of
course much interested

  naturally in the course of the narrative
the name of brigham young was mentioned
said the speaker to his friend

   that you know was not the mans real
name it was simply a nickname

   how in the world did they ever happen
on such a name 

   when the temple was nearing comple-
tion the apostles of the church the ruling
power sent elders broadcast throughout the
land to convert the world their last in-
junctions to these elders were now we
want converts but we want women mostly
bring all you can and bring em young
thats how the first president of the great
mormon church came by the name which
has been handed down to posterity

  the two drummers and tristram laughed
heartily but the englishman did not smile

  nearly an hour later just as they were
pulling into the ogden yards the english-
man spoke for the first time said he

   i cawnt see the point of that mormon
story the mans name you know was
brig-ham young and not bring-em young

chapter xii
pierre is left behind

vjft took pierre and anne marie a
jlljl whole day to make devils port-
age the snow seemed deeper and
jjij interfered with walking they
would take a few steps over the
crust and suddenly break through
sometimes knee-deep and they longed for
snow-shoes

  every mile made in the direction of lake
st john meant at least twice the actual
distance traveled owing to the obstacles they
had to surmount up hill and down across
swamps over rocks and windfalls through
brides sometimes cutting a passage with the
ax turning to escape heavy drifts and some-
times falling into treacherous pits in the
burned land that was covered with a maze of
fallen tree-trunks-there were places where
an advance of a hundred yards was equal
to the toil of miles over better going

  twice the dog disappeared deceived by the
thin coating of shimmering snow that cov-
ered the spaces between the fallen trees and
it was a task to rescue him as he was half
suffocated by the powdery snow that covered
him

  hes not an indian dog yet remarked
anne marie

  no neither is his master equal to a
savage replied pierre

  if he could have seen her look at him
he would have known that to her he was
more than a savage or a white man-more
than any human being she had ever known
and that in her eyes he was perfect

  when they came out upon the river again
they were just above the chute an diable

from here it is about thirty-eight miles

began in thi april railroad mans

to the mouth of the river a good deal less
to the first falls said the girl

  pierre felt cheered up after all it was
but a short distance with good snow-shoes
and a hard frozen river it would have been
but a small matter to have accomplished it
in a day an idea came to him

  look here anne marie he said as
they sat down upon one of the rocks near the
river we cant make regular snow-shoes
but we might be able to manage a couple of
pairs of skis

  what is that she asked

   a kind of snow-shoe used by people on
the other side of the great seas he replied

  but we have nothing we have even left
the piece of caribou hide behind though
that would have been no good

   they are made of a single piece of
wood he answered

  if pierre had asserted his ability to make
a railway engine she would have believed
him she gathered some wood and began to
make tea fortunately there was plenty left
although the milk and sugar had been gone
several days

  after drinking some of the tea pierre de-
cided to try spruce for his ski he cut down
a young tree and split it into long slabs
with the knife they were shaped as well as
possible while anne marie looked on curi-
ously in silence like all simple people she
could not understand a departure from a
long accepted type or make out in what
manner these things were to be used

  pierre had a good deal of trouble in curv-
ing his ski in front he had to make his
slabs thick and shave them forward until
he had them rounded to some extent he
worked a good part of the next morning be-
fore he had two pairs made and the thongs
fastened on trying them he found these

magazine single copies  cents






the railroad mans magazine

had been placed too far back and had to
change them

  anne marie watched him in admiration as
he ran over the crusted snow with them

   theyre not much good in the thick
woods he said when he returned  but
theyll do splendidly on ice

  the girl tried them on also and was
pleased		v

   it is good she declared  they will
not last long the wood should be harder but
we can easily make more

  we will travel far to-morrow anne
marie he declared quite elated

  yes a long way she answered smi-
ling

  but her smile vanished fast if the ice
would bear them most of the way their trip
would last but two or three days more and
then oh she could not bear to think of
it it was cruel

  she had known happiness  a new and
wonderful element had come into her life
she was toil-worn and hungry but did not
feel the aching muscles and the bruised feet
all that she knew was that she could have
gone on like this to the end of life by his
side -and soon he would be gone and the
world would be dreary and empty

  for the first time her stoicism left her
and tears quietly rolled down her cheeks

  pierre saw them

  whats the matter ou-memeou he
asked gently

  i dont know she answered endeavor-
ing to smile through her tears

   i know  exclaimed pierre  youre just
worn out thats the trouble youve had
a harder time of it than i thought and are
played out sit down we can stay here to-
morrow and rest if you like i guess the
grub will hold out

  they sat on a flat rock and pierre placed
one arm upon her shoulders as if she had
been but a tired chum gradually she began
to rest some of her weight on his great chest
the murmur of the great falls became
heavenly music and the snow far in the
distance was converted into a path of light
leading to a manito-nats-a paradise a place
of glory bereft of cold and hunger filled
with all good things wherein she would for-
ever sit by this man with his arm about
her

  and pierre seeking to dry her tears as
if she had been a weary and sorrowing
child stroked her hands and petted her
then it was that he realized she had be-
come very dear to him and that it would

be sad to leave her and that the toil of their
hard trial would be nothing to the tearing
asunder of some fibers of his heart that
seemed to cling to her

   ou-memeou ma tourterelle it will be
hard to leave thee he said

  and as her head lav in the hollow of his
shoulder his face went down nearly to hers
but suddenly he straightened up and stared
fixedly in the distance

   i love the poor little thing he said to
himself  but it will not do if i kissed
her once i would never leave

  in the morning an early start was made
but they could not use their skis in going over
the long portage of the devils falls the
going was too rough and hilly yet they re-
joiced in the idea that when they came to
the river again they would be able to travel
on the ice

  how glorious it would be to get out of
these tangled woods they would have to
be very careful and watch out for air-holes
and thin places over rapid water but would
make several miles an hour only taking to
the shore when compelled to by the falls and
rapids

  with their skis strapped to their backs
they toiled over the long portage the trees
were blazed and it was easy to follow as
compared with so many terrible places they
had already passed

  the portage begun to go down hill in
one place it was covered constantly with ice
by the spray from the falls pierre slipped
once and the girl who was then behind him
called out to him to take care he half
turned to reassure her but again his foot
slipped and like a flash he was over the edge
of the portage clutching wildly at branches
and snow-covered rocks

  the girl threw herself flat upon the path
and advancing her head and shoulders over
the precipitous edge looked down he was
there lying upon some snow that covered a
flat rock jutting over the torrent he was
more than thirty feet below her and made
no answer when she called

  she never could have explained how she
got down beside him clinging to roots
and snow-laden branches resting her feet
upon projecting bits of rock she descended
to where he had fallen and flung herself up-
on him chafing his hands and imploring
him to speak

  she decided that he must be dead and
the light went out of her world she sat
down by him she never could carry him
up the path again and it was the end of
a heart of the north



her life as well as his she would not be
able to bury him he would stay there and
she would watch him and the hunger would
come and the cold would make her sleepy
and she would not fight against it but al-
low the mati-manitous the evil spirits
which had prevailed against the tishe-mani-
tous the good spirits to have their way
for she cared no longer

  this was a separation but not the one she
had feared and dully she thought that per-
haps it was just as well

  they had been beaten-trapped like the
wild creatures the men brought back - and
it was a natural ending like them she
would await the coming of the evil one who
had set the snare

  paddy left above in the path howled
dolefully for he knew that everything was
wrong his voice touched something in the
girls heart some fiber long attuned and never
before made to vibrate she broke into a
mournful cry and threw herself upon the
prostrate form she kissed the beloved face
wildly again and again and held it in her
hands as if the great windego of the falls
had been ready to snatch pierre from her
arms and disappear with him forever

  she noticed a movement of his chest he
opened his eyes and looked about him not
realizing what had happened then he
saw the girl bending over him and noticed
her tears

  he took several long breaths sought for
her hand and kept it within his as if find-
ing comfort in it finally he said

  that came near being the end anne
marie

  she nodded and looked about her a
few feet farther on there would have been
nothing to prevent his falling in the grind-
ing turmoil of the wild waters

  as she sat there in silence she was once
more the shy taciturn daughter of indians
her face was inscrutable the love light gone
out of her eyes her lips no longer quiver-
ing yet within her there was a heart beat-
ing wildly with joy and she realized that
she had been in hades and had come out

   it was a knockout he said  i was
dead to the world lets take an account
of stock and see whats broken its either
my head or my foot-or both

  he felt his head upon which a large lump
was rising

   a good thing its a hard one and that
thick blanket cap helped a lot i must try
to stand up hallo whats the matter with
my foot  

  he was trying to rise but this gave him
such terrific pain that he nearly fainted
again and he collapsed discouraged

   i cant stand on it its surely broken
or badly sprained and theres no more walk-
ing for me ill have to send for an ambu-
lance he said

  his own incongruous thought revived his
spirits he got up on his hands and knees

  we must get out of this ill manage to
crawl somehow he said just see if there
is any way of getting back to the path

  again she looked they were on a flat
rock and a little farther on a great log
cast there by the spring freshets bridged
over a space that separated them from other
rocks above which protruded some scraggy
trees that had grown in the earth washed
into crevices she got astride the log push-
ing the snow away with her hands and
crossed over from rock to rock she reached
the place where the trees grew just above
them there was a steep incline that reached
up to the path by pulling oneself up by
their slender trunks one could reach the
portage but it was a hard job

  she returned and explained the situation
still on his hands and knees he followed her
got across the log and with the girls help
managed to get over the rocks

  by the strength of his arm he managed to
pull himself up the incline to where the
trees grew and finally reached the path
and laid down exhausted and dizzy with
pain

  it had taken him over an hour and at
every step he had found the girls shoulder
ready for him to lean on twice she actu-
ally lifted him

  anne marie cleared a place of snow and
he lay down all that the girl could think
of then was the universal solace of her peo-
ple-a cup of hot tea she made it strong
and black and he was comforted a few
yards away she found a place where the tent
could be pitched she attended to every-
thing deftly as usual and pierre crawled
under his blankets shivering while she
cooked their supper

  the young man could eat a little and
taddy as usual was ravenous but anne
marie looking over the provisions that were
left drank much tea and ate sparingly be-
fore entering the tent for the night she knelt
devoutly and prayed earnestly by the flicker-
ing light of the camp-fire for she realized
that they were in sore straits

  when she came in she suggested that
pierre should take off his boot


the railroad mans magazine

   well have to cut it he answered  i
could never stand to have it pulled of per-
haps we might just unlace it it might
ease it

  she unlaced the boot for him but it did
not relieve the pain he feared to take it
off knowing he would not be able to put it
on again he decided that if it was only a
bad sprain the boot might prevent the swell-
ing and support the ankle to some extent
and left it on

  weve got to go on anne marie he
asserted doggedly the next morning  i had
as soon bear that pain as to sit in this tent
while the food goes and the cold gets worse
im willing to stay here if you want to go on
without me and you can send me help when
you get to the first falls

  very well she said ill leave you the
tent and the food and will be back as soon
as i can

  not a bit you must take the tent you
can build me a little lean-to then you
must take three of the blankets and half the
grub thats left

  she would not hear of taking the tent
and he acknowledged that she was right
when she said its weight would make some
difference in her speed then she showed
him that she could get food as soon as she
reached the first falls while he would have
to remain until she returned with more

  at this time there was left but about three
pounds of meat less than a pound of bacon
enough flour for four or five flapjacks and
about a cupful of beans there was still
plenty of tea and tobacco

  she was soon ready to start with a little
of the food wrapped up in her blankets and
in the waterproof cloth with which she
might make herself a shelter in case she had
to camp out just then she decided that
the present camping-place was bad it was
on a side hill far from the water it would
be better to have it lower near the river
-where he could see down its course she
moved the tent nearly a hundred yards to
a better place and pierre managed to reach
it by leaning upon her shoulder with one
hand

  suddenly he rebelled

  look here anne marie i cant do it
id get the horrors sitting down here and
waiting two or three days there isnt much
left to carry ill take my share of the grub
and blankets and leave all the rest you
travel on as fast as you can but ill follow
ill make crutches

  no said the girl decisively how can

you use the stick snow-shoes you would
drop somewhere in the snow or go through
a hole in the river you will freeze to death
somewhere

  ill worry to death if im left here he
objected meekly

   then we go together she answered

  again- she packed up the tent the blank-
ets and the food

  it was hardly more than one good back
load and she swung it to her head with a
tump-line before this she had made him
a crutch-a mere stick with two spreading
branches cut short-within the fork of which
he could place his armpit she tied a ski
to his sound foot

  pierre at times rested one hand upon
her shoulder whenever his foot touched
the ground he was in pain but gritted his
teeth and went on it took them half an
hour to go a few hundred yards his un-
injured foot slipped once and he tried to
save himself with the sore one the pain
was so keen and fierce that he had to sit
down

  i cant do it nia cherie he acknowl-
edged

  it was the first time that he had ever used
a term of endearment to her and she wept
as she knelt by him

   oh i knew you could not do it have
patience she implored  i can get there
and back by to-morrow night or the next
afternoon please have patience i will
come for you with plenty to eat i will
bring men and dogs they will put you on
a sleigh and take you down easily please
have patience

  in her excitement she had taken his hand
in hers as she implored him she was pet-
ting it and finally she kissed it-and the
suffering man weary and broken with pain
felt a tear coming he took the fine dusky
high-bred little head within his hands and
kissed her for the first time

   go my dear may heaven be with
you  he said

  the tent was pitched once more after
she had spread out his blankets and placed
the cooking things and plenty of wood near
at hand she started

  paddy followed her for a moment and
then went back to his master pierre mo-
tioned him away

  go on paddy boy go on and bring her
back soon

  the dog barking ran away to where the
girl was disappearing in the distance the
ice was strong and she was running with an
a heart of the north



easy lope that promised good time when
he reached her she bent low patted his head
and told him to go back but he remained
behind for only a few yards and then came
up to her again and followed her on and on

chapter xiii

the long wait

anne marie bent to her task with all
the energy that was in her wild
strong nature without any waste of force
she ran on and on and the dog followed
her with tongue hanging from his mouth as
she came to the rapids of the second falls

  it was like a dream after a while her
eyes burned with the glare of the snow and
the pain of her legs possessed her and her
breathing came hard and gasping but she
went on and on and the scenery she knew
so well became unfamiliar she was going
on mechanically scarcely conscious of fa-
tigue impatient where she had to walk glad
when she could run again

  the night was falling when of a sudden
she recognized the rocky cliffs on either side
of the first falls just beyond in hazy faint-
ness a film of smoke was rising in the air
on the eastern shore there was a log cabin
and she was compelled to go some distance
below the falls to find solid ice in order to
cross over

  she reached it at length and a nondescript
dog jumped at paddy and a fight followed
in which neither contestant had much the
best of it when anne marie and a woman
who came out of the cabin interrupted the
proceedings

   quick  cried the girl  where are the
men  

  my man will come soon he has gone
down the river on snow-shoes he should
be back now what is it that you want

  anne marie briefly explained her errand
the monsieur had plenty of money it would
be well worth their while to help him

   the poor young man  exclaimed the
woman  i remember him well he stopped
here on his way up but come in you are
hungry

  the good soul immediately put water on
the stove for tea and brought out bread and
pork which she began to fry and buck-
wheat for cakes

ill have it ready in a minute you
are perished with the cold youve run
from the portage dti diable in a day it is
twenty-five miles just by the river you
 rr

have made a good deal more by having to go
ashore so often it is a terrible time to
travel later on when all the ice is solid
it is easier it is a hard days work for a
strong man

   i remember him well he came all
alone my man said only yesterday that
the young fool must have perished some-
where in the rapids he is a very nice man
he gave my boy some fishhooks and me a
piastre for letting him stay here all night
i did not want to take it at first but he in-
sisted it is a good deal of money of course
and he must be a rich man

   i wish your husband was here inter-
rupted the girl  i suppose he has no
sledge and dogs

   there is no sledge and team of dogs to
be had nearer than the mouth of the river
and thats twelve miles farther down an-
swered the woman sit down and eat my
man will be here very soon

  she placed the food on the rough table
and anne marie ate ravenously around
her a number of small children stood up
looking at her open-mouthed the two dogs
were lying near the stove having forgotten
their quarrel the woman put on her ca-
pote to go out and see whether her husband
was returning

  she returned in a few minutes with her
husband a rather elderly man much broken
by the terrible toil of the settler in hard
countries

  bojoti he said my woman has told
me i am glad the young fool is not drowned
it is a life to be saved of course but we
can do nothing now i will have to go to-
morrow morning to the mouth of the river
for a sledge and dogs and another man

   i will start early and be back by to-
morrow night then the next morning we
will start i dont think we will be able to
make it that day but we will be there early
the next one in the meanwhile you can stay
here and rest yourself

  no i must take provisions and start
right back answered the girl you do not
understand he has very little food he is
anxious and suffers much pain he is a
monsieur you understand and is not used to
hardships like ours you will come as
soon as possible make all speed promise
to come at once 

   the man gave her reluctantly flour pork
bacon and a quart bottle of molasses

  she slept poorly on the rough board floor
of the cabin that night and was up before
daylight the good people gave her some


the railroad mans magazine

breakfast and she wrapped up the food in
her blankets and started she tried to get
the dog to stay behind knowirfg he would
be well cared for but he pleaded so she
allowed him to come

  he will be glad to see you he loves
you she told paddy sadly

  the man promised to start at once he
felt sure that the next night or on the
morning after he would be at the chute du
diable

  anne marie felt stronger she had bor-
rowed a pair of regular snow-shoes and trav-
eled swiftly she ran on for an hour until
it began to snow hard soon she saw nothing
but a mist of heavy falling flakes and the
weather grew somewhat warmer

  all day she journeyed but had to use a
good deal of caution her former tracks
were obliterated and in many places the
treacherous ice was covered but with un-
erring instinct she kept on with the heav-
ier load she carried she was unable to make
quite as good time still she felt that she
could accomplish the journey by nightfall

  when she stopped at noon she felt very
weary but had accomplished more than half
of the journey she was not very hungry
yet she ate a little notwithstanding the
added hardship of pain she kept on and on
until at times she was dazed with the vast
expanses of snow until it seemed that there
never would be an end to them-that she was
fighting her way along to some goal that was
always receding and never could be reached

  yet the well-known portages went by
and she knew again every great blasted
tree that arose gaunt and sad above the
black line of the living ones she recognized
every great snow-covered boulder along the
edge of the river the cliffs the low shores-
the vast places where the water widened
over the shoals and the narrow ones where it
raged through rocky canons

  finally she came in sight of the prom-
ised land a long way off as the light was
just beginning to grow fainter she saw the
little tent she uttered a long ululating cry
hoping that he might hear but nothing
stirred and she ran on

  suddenly she saw him crawling out of the
tent on his hands and knees he waved
one hand at her and she hurried on as if
possessed of wings now she was hardly a
hundred yards away from him and paid no
more attention to her footsteps

  to be near him once more to hear his
voice to give him food to comfort him in
his pain-what happiness

  the ice was bad at that place owing to
the fierce volume of water that rail under
it coming from the great falls just above
several times it cracked under her but she
paid no heed and suddenly it broke

  in an effort to save herself she threw her-
self forward and the bundle she was car-
rying fell and disappeared in the loose
slushy ice that was nothing but a death-trap

  fortunately she only partly sank her
clothes and the loose ice partly kept her from
going under and she managed to keep
scrambling on until on her hands and knees
she reached solid ice once more

  it all happened so suddenly that she was 
safe again before pierre had managed to
take more than a few painful steps in her
direction

  she ran toward him wet and weeping

   the food  she cried  the food i was
bringing you plenty-now it is gone 

  he put an arm around her neck and pat-
ted her cheek as if she had been a sorrow-
ing child

  never mind he said thank heav-
en you didnt go under indeed i am happy
to see you safe and well i have been very
lonely without you ou-memeou

  but she could hardly be comforted she
wept as he made her go under the tent and
take off the clothes that were freezing on
her she was soon wrapped up in his
blankets and he built a roaring fire just
outside the tent and hung her clothes as near
it as he could with safety

  she told him the simple story of her jour-
ney

  to-morrow night they will be here with
a sledge and dogs and more food or
perhaps not until the next morning but they
will surely come

   let us hope so he said  there is
mighty little left

   i could start back again to-morrow
morning she proposed then i would
not need food till night and at the first
falls there is plenty to eat

  no dont leave me again anne marie
there is enough for a meal or two and then
we wont have to wait long the time was
very hard without you i sometimes feared
something would happen to you it kept
me awake during the night

  pierre shivered as he thought again of all
he had endured in her absence - the long
day during which he had worried lest some-
thing should happen to her and the fierce
pain he had suffered from his injured ankle
then the night-tenfold longer never
a heart of the north



ending-when the cold had bitten him sav-
agely and the suffering had grown worse and
the horrors evoked by his imagination had
crucified him

  he had seen her sinking through the ice
and disappearing and the thought that he
would perish alone was nothing compared
to the feeling that ou-memeou would never
again be near him

  the morning had come at length and the
booming of the great falls had seemed like
a portentous voice calling out for lives lives
more lives when the snow fell again it was
a white fall something that blotted out liv-
ing things it hid the world and stifled the
cries of dying men

  he was thankful indeed to see her again
there was no more fear nothing but the idea
that ou-memeou was near him that he could
chafe her cold hands in his that he could
kiss her dear face

  but he was shocked to see how dreadfully
worn she was even during her illness up
the river she had not looked so wan her
dusky indian complexion had become of a
grayish hue

  on the next day they took the bit of meat
that was left boiled it and drank the soup
they also drank strong tea then they be-
gan to wonder whether the men would ar-
rive that afternoon

   the new snow has made the traveling
hard said anne marie  i think they will
only be here to-morrow

  when they had finally given up hope they
went to sleep very hungry especially pierre
and the dog since anne marie had partaken
of two hearty meals at the first falls on
the next day they finished the little piece of
boiled meat and then nothing was left but
a very small handful of rice and beans
that they found at the bottom of one of the
bags but it did not matter the men would
come soon

  a any moment they might appear around
the distant point and then how they would
eat they watched and watched and dared
hardly leave the bank where their lookout
was for fear of missing the first view of
their arrival yet the hours were passing
and the men did not come

  then they boiled the few beans and the
grains of rice which made but a couple of
mouthfuls apiece and drank more tea far
into the night they watched and listened
but j no one came over the vast expanse of
snow and ice and the woods were silent
but for the wind that sighed through the
trees and the masses of snow that occa-

sionally fell with a dull sound from the over-
laden branches

  hunger was beginning to feel very pain-
ful it was a sensation as if something
living was gnawing them but anne marie
had often been hungry before she said
that this feeling would grow fainter and less
troublesome soon and then the men would
arrive they chewed pieces of leather from
their tump-lines to give themselves the illu-
sion that they were eating something but
poor paddy whined often and looked at
them pitifully they were very nervous
from drinking tea without food

  when the morning came they were very
feeble but they began to look down the
river before it was really light enough to
see very far

  pierre placed his hand on anne maries
shoulder

   i should have let you go back he said
 it was selfish of me to keep you here if
you are strong enough perhaps you had better
leave me now and try to reach the first falls
i am glad she answered i am hap-
py to be here with you

  her devotion touched him deeply he
knew by this time how dear he was to her
the love light in her eyes burned more
brightly since her return their hunger
and the cold seemed to put them upon a
plane of equality there was no longer a
monsieur and a poor montagnais girl but
merely two beings who had suffered

  as he looked at her he began to worry
over her thinness and the fact that she was
again breathing with some difficulty he felt
no fear for himself yet a chill passed
through his heart at the thought that if help
did come she might die before him yet
she said she did not suffer

  paddy rose restlessly weak from hunger
and from the toil of preceding days and
begged for food licking pierres hand with
his dry tongue suddenly his master had
an idea

  poor old paddy he said youve got
to save us

  sadly he took the little pistol out of the
bag and anne marie asked him what he was
going to do

  the poor old dog is starving like us
he said i cant stand it any more and
you are looking so pale so ill you must have
something to eat

  oh wait till night she cried just
this day you love the little dog i love
him too the sledge must come soon it
is two days late they would not let us die


the railroad mans magazine

they thought i brought back the food and
dont know we are starving please let him
live 

   why anne marie you savages dont
often care so much about a dog

   oh we have to kill our dogs sometimes
but men often go terribly hungry before do-
ing it you are going away you know and
then perhaps i will never see you again
perhaps you will leave me the little dog to
remember you by i will love him much
always and take good care of him

  tears were coming down her cheeks and
she looked very feeble pierre was suddenly
smitten hard as he realized how this child
of the wilderness had learned to love him
tears came to him too and he crawled over
to the girl who was lying down bent over her
and kissed her

  you shall have the little dog anne
marie he will love you and i will love
you also always

  from the expanse of ice and snow that
stretched south of them came a shout and
the firing of a gun they crawled out of
the tent and stood up and a feeble cheer
arose from them over the ice came two men
and a sledge harnessed to five big nonde-
script mongrels the rescuers were shocked
to find them in such a state in a few mo-
ments there was food in abundance which
at first they were allowed to partake of only
sparingly

chapter xiv
hand in hand

the two men were new settlers on the
lower eastern shore of the pcribonca
they explained that their dog team had been
borrowed by a neighbor who only returned
it the day after they were notified they
were badly exhausted and had needed a rest
coming up they had experienced a hard
time owing to the deep snow and the poor
ice and the difficulty of getting the sledge
over the portages they also said that they
were not voyageurs and were not used to
such long trips

  they did not possess a tent and fixed up
a little lean-to for the night they were
very tired and as soon as they had eaten
their supper and fed the dogs they went to
sleep

  pierre and the girl sat in the tent look-
ing at each other wondering at the marvel-
ous new element that had come into their
lives

  pierre felt very serious he had decided
that life with this little girl as a companion
would be happy he cared nothing for
civilization the great north had been very
hard to him yet he loved it it was the
country for him far from the influence of
those whose conduct is all fettered by metes
and bounds

  he had savage blood in him and it called
him back he would have nothing to do
with the people of cities he would trade
in the furs of the north and its lumber and
mines he would help open the country
and when it grew too civilized for him he
would move on into the vastness farther and
farther on and always he would have the
love of this girl

  surely ou-memeou had in her every ele-
ment that would make for his happiness
she was strong in mind in love in devotion
a rest would build her up again and she
would be his help among the vanguard of
those who were uplifting the new empire of
the north

  anne marie finally broke the silence

   you must sleep she said  unless you
want me to get you more food to-morrow
will be a hard day

  youre a regular little mother looking
after her little one he replied passing his
hand over her head  we will be out of
the woods in a few days ma cherie and be
no longer troubled with hunger and pain
and then we will make a new life for our-
selves

   a new life she pondered  the life
now is very good

  why anne marie

   because she answered looking at the
ground before her  because i am with you
and through the cold and into the night that
is enough to make a sunshine that warms
my heart

  pierres arm went around her waist and
he drew her toward him and kissed her
pretty oval face

   i will try to keep the sunshine ever in
that little heart of yours he answered

  that night she had no wish to sleep for
it would interrupt her happiness

  early in the morning the dogs were fed
the things packed on the sledge and pierre
was placed upon it suffering from a deep
sense of humiliation at being obliged to ride
while the others trudged alongside

  marche  cried one of the men

  the dogs bent forward and threw their
weights upon their harness and the sledge
slowly broke out and they were off most
a heart of the north



of the time the girl walked ahead distrust-
ing the ability of the two habitants to select
the best and safest places when they came
to portages or were obliged to go ashore on
account of bad ice pierre generally ltd to
get off the sledge he would go on slowly
suffering excruciating pains in his wounded
ankle one hand rested upon the girls
shoulder and he used his crutch with the
other

  the rest he had had in the tent while
waiting had not improved his leg he
could allow no weight at all to rest upon it
he had not taken off the boot since the
accident fearing he would not be able to
put it on again and often wondered what
was really the matter with it it must be
something worse than a mere sprain some-
times the men had to carry him and anne
marie looked on jealously

the

   another long day elapsed before they
 reached the first falls and pierre was taken
 into the log house for the night and made
 very welcome then came the farther trip
 nearly to the mouth of the river to the
 house of one of the men who had two good
 horses

    here they bade good-by to their two help-
 ers who opened their eyes at the liberality
 with which they were rewarded

   pierre and anne marie sat in the log
 house that night and their hands slowly
 clasped then their arms held each other and
 then their lips met

    it was a long journey i am glad it
 is over said anne marie

    a longer journey will begin for us dear-
 est we will stroll together through life-
 unto death my love shall it be so

     yes said anne marie softly

new mallet compound

great northern develops special type of giant engine for its heavy
grades in the cascades and rockies

anew type of locomotive in use on the great
northern railroad somewhat similar in de-
sign to the mallet compound is described in the
spokesinan-revicu as follows

the total length of the leviathan is  feet and
it is capable of hauling from  to  fifty-ton
cars on a level track

the total weight of the engine with tender is

	pounds while the tractive effort is about

	pounds

the rear engine has four pairs of driving-wheels
while the forward has but three pairs the drivers
are  inches in diameter the cylinders of the
rear pressure engine are  x  inches while those
of the forward engine are  x  inches

the locomotive as it stands cost  and

was built under the supervision of g h emerson
superintendent of motive power of the great north-
ern mr emerson has been in the employ of the
great northern since a young man having started
in as a fireman in 

  the performance of this engine will be watched
with interest for if it does the work it was de-
signed for in a satisfactory manner the construction
of others will follow

  the new engine is designed for use on the heavy
grades encountered in the rocky mountains in
montana and in the cascade range in washing-
ton

  the use of these locomotives does away with
the use of double-headers and helping engines on
the mountain divisions

torpedo block system

would railroad wrecks be any less frequent
if the engineer on approaching a point of
danger heard a bomb explode under his engine in
addition to the visual but silent signal of the time-
honored semaphore or  target  

  r j zorge of chicago who when he is not
selling wheat or com on the board of trade is an
inventor thinks he has a remedy for these acci-
dents

  it is a device for exploding a small-sized bomb
or a  torpedo  under the locomotive where it can-
not fail to be heard both by the engineer and fire-
man

  it was with the idea of making use of the sense

of hearing as well as that of sight that mr zorge
invented his automatic torpedo-magazine which has
now stood the test of a year and a half of con-
tinuous service without a failure it is said on the
long island railroad

  the torpedo-magazine consists of a rotating disk
on which are twenty arms like the spokes of a
wheel each holding a torpedo at its extremity

  underneath the disk is the mechanism for pushing
one of the torpedo-arms out over the rail and the
whole is mounted in a cast-iron casing about the
size of a washtub with a cover which leaves a
small aperture on the track side through which the
torpedo is protruded when necessary

brain teasers

perplexing problems that may possibly produce perfection
in precision perception and perspicacity

        mr dan m powell the n p operator at black river washington sends
        in the following	

              how many times brighter will the headlight of a locomotive appear at a
         distance of  miles than it does at  miles

              an engineer half a mile from a station sees the semaphore light with a
         certain distinctness how many times brighter will the light have to be in order
         to be seen with the same clearness at a distance of  miles

             from w h st address not given we received this one

               a train with thirty cars south bound and a train with thirty cars north
         bound meet at a siding which will only hold thirty cars and an engine the switch
         has thirty bad-order cars on it with draw-bars on at each end so any of the cars
         to be moved must be pushed not pulled each engine can only handle thirty cars at
         one time thirty bad-order cars must be left on switch as found how do the two
         trains get past the bad-order cars

             the correct answers to these teasers will be found in our october number

answers to the august teasers

              both trains would be the same distance from albany when they met

               suppose the trains have each been running at a given rate of speed for 
         minutes and that at that time the conditions of the problem are met in so far as equal
         distance is concerned in  minutes the flier would travel  miles and the freight
          miles at the beginning of the run the freight must then have been  miles ahead
         instead of  then we have the following proportion

                    x x being the required result which gives the value of x as 
         miles  rods and  feet

              adopting this result we find that the flier will have run exactly  - miles
         and that will be the distance between the trains

october is our anniversary-our fourth whis-

by blowing off a few blasts of extra steam
just to show that we are carrying more pressure than
ever and that all our joints are as tight as they
were on that memorable day four years ago when
we started on our first run

  we have been bucking the grade pretty consist-

of the crew-thev have been loyal workers who have
gathered but a very few brownies

air-lever out of the window you wont make a
stop until you have reached the last page

  when the con gives the high-ball for the birth-

be aboard

  there will be a short story called  a million
dollars a tale of ingenious touches and intense
speculation of a man who put a pile of gold on pub-
lic exhibition

  robert fulkerson hoffman will have a story of
the tortures that a towerman suffered who was
forced to remain on duty for over two days and
nights he had to keep awake all that time read
how he did it

  r k culver will tell of the scenic enterprises of
a certain westerner in a way that will make you
want to tie down the laughter whistle until the end
is reached

  emmet f harte will be aboard with another yarn
about honk and horace-our old friends this
time they encounter a young man of wild-eyed
bravado named dauntless dick

  there will also be stories by frank condon f

  among the special articles amo dosch will de-
scribe the new bergen tunnel near jersey city a
wonderful piece of engineering construction just
completed by the erie the present-day tendency

of railroads to burrow through the ground as they
approach their terminals has been abandoned by
the erie which believes in a right-of-way of fresh

  c f carter has a most interesting paper about
the fine art of running a freight-train he will give
us an idea of the grievances of the freight conduc-
tor whose train earns three times as much as the
fast expresses which go by with a whirl while he
is stewing on the sidings

  the home for aged and disabled railroad men at
evanston illinois will be the subject of a special
story

  robert h rogers is preparing an interesting
article describing at length the walschaert valve-
gear it will probably go in the birthday special
but may be held for another month we have had
a great many requests for this article and promise
that it will be the last word on this interesting and
timely subject

  in ten thousand miles by rail gilson wil-

a locomotives long suit

in another part of our magazine this month there
is an article which under the title of the
best-tailored individual on the line sets up
a spick-and-span new signboard at the various
crossroads of railroad mechanical departments and
points the way afresh upon well-known paths of
money-saving

  it has besides a peculiar interest of its own it
is quite aside from the beaten track of such
statistics even though it remains consistently
throughout on the solid ground of fact indeed it
is very modest in its claims for the value of careful
lagging and jacketing of locomotives or other ex-
posed heated surfaces which are not intended for
external heating

  therefore back here on the carpet we follow the




the railroad mans magazine

trend of the article a little farther even at the risk
of producing figures which at first sight may seem
too good to be true

  suppose that for safetys sake we go quite below
the twenty-six per cent for the locomotive and thir-
ty-nine per cent for the preserving-cylinder as re-
corded of the tests at chicago and las vegas and
say that a locomotive properly protected with its
modern  long suit  will save twenty-five per cent
of the coal that a  naked  locomotive would have
to use to do an equal amount of work

  assume again that a ton of coal averaging the
country over costs  delivered onto the tender of
the locomotive that is probably a very safe esti-
mate

  assume then that each locomotive in use on the
interstate roads will for  days out of  make
an actual or constructive mileage of  miles a
day and use each day  tons of coal that is to
say each properly jacketed locomotive will make a
total yearly mileage of  actual or construc-
tive and its coal bill will be  that also
would be a very low and safe estimate so far as any
fear of exaggeration may be considered

  and now for the fireworks

  since we have taken the unjacketed engine re-
ferred to in mr hoffmans article as the basis of
calculation then the  fuel bill of the jacketed
engine is only seventy-five per cent of what the
naked engines  bill would be and the jacket
stands to save an even  per engine per work-
ing year of  days as we have assumed it

  the latest available government report interstate
commerce commission d report  gives
the total number of locomotives of all classes in
use by the common carriers on june   as
 just foot that up please at  saved
per engine per year no dont we are not go-
ing to back away from it we have come too near
to finishing it we shall foot it up ourselves

  it amounts to  no that is not a
misprint fifty-seven million six hundred and
ninety-eight thousand dollars saved yearly in the
united states by locomotive jackets and they are
not making a single hiss or sputter about it makes
the whistle sound silly doesnt it but then there
is no way of telling what the whistle saves in one
way and another year in and year out

  there it all is figure it over for yourselves
and tell us where it is wrong

for over a year or more we have received numer-
ous requests from readers in all parts of the
country to print in the carpet the touching poem
by cy warman entitled  clickety click the
words of this little railroad ballad made a great hit
among trainmen from coast to coast at the time of
its first appearance years ago and that its popular-
ity still lives to-day shows that the merit it contains
has not gone unappreciated with the passing of

      at the front of the fast express

      clickety click though miles apart

      to her he is always near

      and she feels the click of her happy heart
      for the heart of the engineer

      over the river and down the dell

      beside the running stream

      she hears the clang of the engine-bell-

      the whistles startled scream

     clickety click an open switch-

      onward the engine flies

      clickety click theyre in the ditch

      oh angels hide her eyes

      clickety click and down the track
      the train will dash to-day

      but what of the ribbons of white and black
      the engine wears away

      clickety click oh worlds apart-

     the maiden hangs her head

      there is no click in the maidens heart-

      the engineer is dead

   greater terminals needed

james j hill chairman of the board of di-
rectors of the great northern railway pre-
pared a paper dealing with the increasing necessity
for greater terminal facilities which was presented
at a meeting of the northern association of millers
in this paper mr hill states that the pressure
upon the existing terminal facilities is a future
menace and a present handicap he says

  for months it has been impossible to get freight
 shipments delivered promptly if these have to be
 transferred at any of the central markets or prin-
 cipal terminal points

 the flood of business that rose to such a dan-
gerous height in  is piling up again with the
additions made by national growth since then the
future will add in increasing ratio to these difficul-
ties as well as to the losses they involve

 the only probable relief from the pressure on
our transportation agencies and especially on termi-
nals where the greatest difficulty exists is the de-
cline of our export trade

 the demand of the home consumer is lessening
the volume of our export of foodstuffs and will
affect similarly some other items on the list

  but this change will bring relief to the carrier
 only in so far as export terminals are concerned

 an enormous volume of new traffic is being de-
on the editorial carpet



veloped by the industrial advance of the country
between the mississippi river and the pacific coast
all of this must seek its market and much of it will
be added to the total that already overburdens our
terminals

   in the great markets of the eastern half of our
country the crisis has already arrived traffic
growth and terminal congestion are applying the
brakes to business progress this means trouble
for the whole country

  it is no more disastrous to have the banks close
their doors than to have the railroads choked

   the problem of terminals is the greatest problem
of the country the problem of transportation agen-
cies of financiers of the communities directly affect-
ed and of all the industries that depend directly or
indirectly upon cheap and speedy carriage for the
commodities which they buy and sell

   it is a problem for everybody since probably
not one business man in the whole country would
fail to see the disastrous effects if it were to be
neglected for the next five years as it has for the
last ten and to blight the present form of activity
by paralyzing the whole trade

  it is not the province of the eagle eye and the
con of this train to get mixed up in disputes of any
sort nor do we think that we are equipped to tell
the nation how to run itself or the i c c how to
fix rates but we do believe in our humble way
that these words of mr hill have no leaks in the
joints and should be read as carefully as an engi-
neer reads his orders by every american citizen

another old one

here is another old railroad poem for your
scrap-books boys it was sent to us by
mr j w wood of the katy who resides in dal-
las texas sometimes we believe that in the four
years since the railroad mans magazine was
started we have published about every old-time
poem worth keeping-but some kind reader kindles
our surprise with another do you know any
have you an old poem tucked away in your scrap-
book or your treasure-box which we have not pub-
lished if so make a copy of it and send it in
lets get all these good old songs and poems before
the public through the columns of the carpet
the poem sent to us by mr wood is called

how it works

what would you do asked the fireman grim

  of the sooty engineer

as the latter turned and looked at him
with a patent self-coupling sneer-

 what would you do if you jumped the track
  with another train in view

and found you couldnt stop or back-

  then what dye spose youd do  

do cried the sooty engineer

  with a look of pluck on toast

 you bet your shovel id stay right here

  and perish at my post 

and the fireman gazed with mute respect
on his chum and fed the flame

and wondered if the train were wrecked

  if he would prove as game

the engine tore the starless night
into long thin shreds of dark

and marked its headlong reckless flight
with many a blazing spark

and the engineer on his locker perched
looked down on his humble friend

until on a switch the engine lurched

and canted end oer end

and there in the broken steaming wreck
the luckless fireman lay

with a badly dislocated neck

and a general look of decay

and the passengers gazed upon the smash
where the ditch and the engine bumped
to see the engineer all hash-

but they didnt-he had jumped

a technical bureau

the formation of a permanent technical bureau
composed of active members of the master car
builders association was discussed at its recent
convention the members of the bureau it is sug-
gested are to have a thorough technical training
president wildin the father of the idea suggested
that one member of this bureau be a salaried incum-
bent with a compensation which would permit a
man fully equipped through experience and train-
ing to accept it it was suggested that the bureau
be given authority to act for the association on all
important matters arising between the annual meet-
ings and that it make a report at the next annual
meeting there is much work that such a bureau
could handle to advantage the development dur-
ing the past year particularly in connection with
government activity on railroad questions shows
the great necessity for having some organization of
this character which can act officially on technical
questions for the whole association

the lay of the dead cow

we are indebted to one of our readers who is
connected with the m and n a r r for
the following poem he tells us in his very kind
letter that it was composed by one of the engineers
no names are given but our correspondent assures
us that the author was the man  who saw what
was left of the cow

collins on no 

black killed the sheep and collins the cow

if you read these lines i will tell you how

collins changed the  for engine 

and said old man can this engine run

the old man said  well i guess some

now on straight track or around a curve

to hold her open you havent the nerve

so collins started south on no 

and the fireman was busy as he could be

a mile south of moro out on the line

now remember collins was making up time

while looking ahead he saw a cow

and said the speed of this engine i will try
     now


the railroad mans magazine

 so he looked at the fireman and winked his eye
 and said  son get busy i am going to try
 to show that cow what she is about 

 she is on my time and no flag out

 and i tell you lad she will have to hump
 if i dont put this engine against her rump

 the race was short but the cow died game

 but you ought to have seen her behind the train-
 a few crushed bones an old loose hide

 so	you may guess why this cow died

 this cow was a scrub but she is dead

 and the company will pay for a thoroughbred
 jersey heifer or a hereford bull

 because the farmers have a pull

 with the lawyers judge and the jury too

 and a railroad company they always dc
 get good money and then smile and tell

 they have another fine cow they wish to sell

 and will sell it too because it is fine

 the next time collins comes down the line

our thanks for this

 editor the railroad mans magazine 

 haye been a consistent reader of the railroad
 mans magazine since its initial appearance
 and i wish to state that i have never found
 anything in this class of literature that ranked any-
 where near the railroad mans

 it is the only periodical that i can read with the
 same untiring interest from cover to cover and the
 only one that tells railroad stories in railroad style
 and is thoroughly appreciated by railroad men

 the true story series is a feature that is worth
 the price alone while  by the light of the lan-
 tern  department is enjoyed by every one from the
 master mechanic to the humblest grease-wiper the
  observations of a country station-agent  is o
 k and the pen pictures of emmet f harte would
 chase the frowns from the most dignified official of
 any railway system in the country

 is like shaking hands with some of the old boys we
 knew in former days

 let them come same as ever theres always a
 feed and a place to kip and the lake is fine

 no hard feelings but please try to cut out the

to prevent railroad accidents

 xhe chicago and northwestern railway has ta-
 ken a step in the right direction by appoint-
 ing an official whose chief duty is to make a study
 of railway accidents and by a system of education
 and strict enforcement of discipline endeavor to
 eliminate the most fruitful cause of injuries to pas-
 sengers and damages to freight opportunity was
 recently taken of the reorganization of the companys
 claim department says the scientific american to
 relieve the claim-agent of much of the detail of his
 work and allow him to make a careful study of the
 causes of all accidents in the handling of passengers
 and freight it will be his duty to bring about a
 more thorough cooperation and a higher state of
 discipline among the various employees upon whose
 fulfilment of their duties the safe operation of the
 trains immediately depends

 the scheme is a most excellent one and we be-
 lieve that its results will be so satisfactory as to lead
 to similar arrangements on at least the more im-
 portant railroads of the country

at the end of the wire

  good friend sends the following poera for
 the carpet it sizes up the joys and trou-
 bles of a despatchers office just about right doesnt
 it how many of you have had such experiences
 as this

in a despatchers office

by charles w billman

 the train-despatchers office you all are aware
 lhe operation of railroading comes under its care
 tis an office which never is allowed to close
 midnight to midnight as the year around goes

 they arrange the make-up of a train

 advise when and where a crew gets same

 supplies cars to points issuing requisition

 and has the authority in furnishing disposition

 the train-despatcher from a certain point of view
 deserves great credit and all that is due

 he must be exact and accurate where responsibility
       lies

 and be able to answer any question that may arise

 to insure safety the train-despatcher must
 assume great responsibility hope and trust

 in his ability to protect and guide

 the movements of trains the schedules he provides

 serious incidents in many instances every day
 will cause some trains more or less delay

 especially on single track where advantages lack
 those of on double where they run opposite track
on the editorial carpet



from various points out over tiie line

reports of trains both late and on time

first second third class local and through

as well work-trains specials and extras too

to get this train through without delay

the train-despatcher must some figuring display

extra  with an important train

standing still on the eastbound main

to clear per diem they must clear track
for following trains that got up in back

c	 e extra  from  s f  wires

percentage of locomotives

editor the railroad mans magazine

in the august number of the railroad mans
magazine page   e r of parsons kan-
sas asks what is meant by the percentage of a
locomotive which question you were unable to
answer

the only way in which i have known the word

percentage to be used in connection with locomo-
tives was in reference to their hauling capacity or
tractive power some roads term their most power-
ful locomotives -per-cent engines and the small-
er ones are rated in proportion for instance if
the -per-cent engine has a tractive power of

	pounds one having a tractive power of -

	pounds would be a -per-cent engine and
so on

  the new york central lines base their locomo-
tive hauling capacity percentages on 
pounds they have of course no locomotive hav-
ing such high tractive power but this system is
much simpler than the other an engine having

	pounds tractive power being a -per-cent
engine one having  pounds being a -per-
cent engine and so on

  these percentages are all entered in the locomo-
tive classification book opposite the number of
each engine so that even an inexperienced person
can see at a glance the relative hauling capacities of
all the locomotives on the system and the approxi-
mate tractive power of each locomotive

fastest thing on wheels

in our july number we published an item from
the engineering record stating that the fast-
est mile on record was made by barney oldfield in
the automobile  lightning benz at daytona
florida march  last the figure touched by mr
oldfield was  miles per hour a measured
mile being covered in  seconds

  we received a great many communications re-
garding this burst of speed many claiming that the
writer was mistaken-that faster miles had been
made one of the most interesting of these com-
munications is from the kansas city star and we
publish it herewith

  in a recent issue of the star i read an item in
which it was said that a mile in  seconds made
by a motor-car was the fastest ever traveled by a
human being an incident in which a locomotive
greatly exceeded this speed came under my notice
many years ago it may be interesting

  in  i was station-agent at bonfield illinois
on a branch of the big four railway two pas-
senger-trains met there daily at  pm that go-
ing east having the right-of-way kankakee was
the next station east of me eleven miles away if
the west-bound train was a bit late it was customary
for the despatcher to give it a  time-order  against
the east-bound train to reach bonfield

  billy campbell was running the  one day on
the west-bound passenger-a big engine with -
inch drivers-and almost invariably when he had
that train he was late and invariably he had to ask
for  help  to reach bonfield to meet the east-
bound train finally the despatcher tired of it
and on this particular day inquired of conductor
lester at kankakee why he couldnt make his
thirty-miles-an-hour schedule

  tell him lester replied  that campbell is our
engineer now it chanced that campbell oiling
his engine heard this answer and it angered him
so that he hopped aboard the   lester caught
the rear car and before the despatcher could send
the usual time-order the train had gone


the railroad man s magazine

  the illinois central crossing was a quarter of a
mile from kankakee a half-mile farther on was
another dead stop for the draw-bridge over the
kankakee river then came three miles up-grade
out of the kankakee river valley and then eight
miles of straight track down a slope of twenty feet
to the mile into bonfield-and just ten minutes for
the    to make it

  allowing three minutes for the two dead stops
seven minutes remained for the eleven miles when
we at bonfield saw campbells smoke as he came
over the summit of the grade he had exactly three
and one-half minutes left for the eight miles straight-
away

  campbell probably was running seventy-five
miles an hour then the train was swaying the pas-
sengers as we afterward heard were clinging to the
seats in fright the landscape they said was only
a blur

  about a mile and a half from bonfield campbell
shut off steam closed his throttle and rolled into
the station ten seconds ahead of time he had
made the eight miles in  minutes and  seconds
not allowing anything for the time lost in coming to
a stop it was figured that he must have covered
some miles in  or  seconds

  was it possible for an engine to do that i rely
on the train-sheet figures as they were reported
and i know that when the train stopped conductor
lester went forward and told campbell that if he
ever did such a thing again with him aboard hed
shoot him

seventeen billions in railroads

in spite of those who arc still moaning about
hard times and more panics the railroads are
forging ahead at a rate that tells an entirely differ-
ent story more figures showing the ever-increas-
ing golden hoard represented by the railroads of
this country were recently made public by the in-
terstate commerce commission disclosing the fact
that on june   the face value of the amount
of railway capital outstanding was 
of this amount  was in the hands
of the public

   of the total capital outstanding there existed as
stock  of which  was
common and  was preferred the re-
maining part  represented funded
debt consisting of mortgage bonds 
collateral trust bonds   plain bonds
debentures and notes  income bonds
 miscellaneous obligations -
 and equipment trust obligations 

  of the total capital stock outstanding -
 or  per cent paid no dividends the
amount of dividends declared during the year was
 being equivalent to  per cent on
dividend-paying stocks no interest was paid on
 or  per cent of the total amount of
funded debt outstanding omitting equipment trust
obligations

  the total number of persons reported as on the
pay-rolls of the steam roads of the united states on
june   was  or an average of 

per  miles of line as compared with returns
for june   there was an increase of 
in the total number of railway employees there
were  enginemen  firemen  con-
ductors  other trainmen and  switch-
tenders crossing-tenders and watchmen the total
amount of wages and salaries reported as paid to
railway employees during the year was 

  the summaries show that on june   there
was a total single-track railway mileage in the
united states of  indicating an increase
of  miles over the corresponding mileage at
the close of the previous year substantially com-
plete returns were rendered to the commission for
 miles of line operated including 
miles used under trackage rights the aggregate
mileage of railway tracks of all kinds covered by
operating returns was 

  during the year railway companies owning
 miles of line were reorganized merged or
consolidated

speed in the south

editor the railroad-mans magazine

since the first number of the best magazine on
railroading published in the united states-
the railroad mans magazine - appeared i
have read each issue from the pilot to the markers
on the dog-house each number is better than the
preceding one and if the good things increase as
they have heretofore it will take a bimonthly issue
to get it all in

  articles on speed records have held my greatest
interest and a number with such articles is put
with a separate file to refer to at odd times in all
these articles i cannc recall to mind just at the
moment whether there has ever been anything about
speed-records in the south trains in this part of
the world are conceded to be slow but with per-
mission i would like to present a few records

  the old plant system which was dealt with some
months ago in an article about the founder of the
line henry bradford plant holds the worlds rec-
ord for short-distance speed in march  an
extra pulled by a -inch ten-wheeler built by the
rhode island locomotive works made the run
from fleming to jacksonville florida a distance
of five miles in the short time of two minutes and
thirty seconds flat-a speed of  miles an hour
several of these engines are still in service between
jacksonville and waycross and savannah georgia
changed to atlantic coast line and numbered
from  to  inclusive how many cars were
in the train at the time the run took place i cannot
say but it is improbable that there were more than
three

  then again in  the plant system and the
atlantic coast line jointly handled a train from
jacksonville to richmond virginia a distance of
 miles in  hours and  minutes at an
average speed of  considering the condi-
tions to be met with in southern railroading this
run was remarkable as also was the run made in
march  from jacksonville to savannah 
miles in  hours and  minutes by the atlantic
coast line with the old plant systems equipment
the speed for this run was made at an average of
 miles an hour-d v h tampa florida

one telephone
dumb
five million eloquent

  if there were only one telephone
in the world it would be exhibited
in a glass case as a curiosity

  even in its simplest form tele-
phone talk requires a second instru-
ment with connecting wires and
other accessories

  for real useful telephone service
there must be a comprehensive
system of lines exchanges switch-
boards and auxiliary equipment
with an army of attendants always
on duty

  connected with such a system a
telephone instrument ceases to be a
curiosity but becomes part of the

great mechanism of universal com-
munication

  to meet the manifold needs of
telephone users the bell system has
been built and today enables twenty-
five million people to talk with one
another from five million telephones

  such service cannot be rendered
by any system which does not cover
with its exchanges and connecting
lines the whole country

  the bell system meets the needs
of the whole public for a telephone
service that is united direct and
universal
