inccr in the world -dave martin febr all complete m tmsllver cross novelette by e s dellinger fiction-f act articles-pictures noahwebster thought that colds ivere caused if comets master scholar compiler of the great dictionary webster was among the first to inquire into the
baffling causes of that private and public menace
-the common cold

  his conclusion that colds were due to the fear-
ful plunge of meteors through the sky was far
from the truth but no less distant than that of
other savarits who assigned colds to the bite of
bedbugs and to sitting in cold damp churches
dr thomas haynes 

  for centuries hundreds of absurd theories as to
the cause of colds were advanced only to be
sharply exploded but now one has been presented
that science has generally accepted this is the
filtrable virus theory

  research men say the bacteria of this virus are
so small the microscope cannot see them so tiny
they cannot be trapped by the most selective
filters only by their harmful effect on the human
body can their existence be established with such
a virus scientists have repeatedly inoculated
others with one persons cold

at the first sign oj a cold

granting that colds are due to a virus that enters
the mouth nose and throat is it not a wise pre-
cautionary measure to use a good antiseptic to
fight such bacteria is it not wisdom to keep the
oral cavity clean and healthy noted physicians
tell us that it is millions of people find that it is

  numerous tests have shown that regular users
of listerine did not catch as many colds as non-
users nor were their colds so severe moreover
countless letters this company has received testify
to listerines remarkable ability to check colds
and to the almost immediate relief it gives in
cases of ordinary sore throat

  the moment listerine enters the mouth it
dislodges germ-bearing debris and kills literally
millions of germs on mouth and throat surfaces

  yet it is absolutely safe-does not irritate del-
icate membranes that is a point of utmost im-
portance in an antiseptic excessive strength in a
mouthwash may prove to be a danger instead of a

kidney acidity curbed
 quickly this easy way

doctors praise cystex-works in is minutes

cleans out acids and poisons
-purifies blood-brings new
energy in  hours

  there are  million tiny delicate tubes or filters in
your kidneys which must work every minute of the nigrht
and day cleaning- out acids poisons and wastes from
your blood if your kidneys or bladder do not function
right your body gradually becomes poisoned you feel
old and worn-out before your time and may suffer from
any of these energy-killing symptoms getting up nights
loss of vigor leg pains nervousness lumbago swollen
joints rheumatic pains dizziness dark circles under
eyes headaches frequent colds burning smarting
itching and acidity

  but you need not suffer another day from poorly func-
tioning kidneys or bladder without the benefits of a
doctors special prescription called cystex pronounced
siss-tex

  dr t j rastelli famous doctor
surgeon and scientist of london says
cystex is one of the finest remedies
i have ever known in my medical prac-
tice any doctor will recommend it for
its definite benefits in the treatment
of many functional kidney and bladder
disorders it is safe and harmless
cystex is not an experiment-it is
quick and sure in action and has been
tested and proved in millions of cases
throughout the world because it com-
bats and corrects many functional kid-
 t  p   ney disorders cystex has gained a
ur i j kasieui world-wide reputation as a suocessful
treatment dr t a euis graduate of toronto univer-
sity recently wrote cystexs influence in aiding the
treatment of sluggish kidney and bladder functions can-

not be over-estimated i have here a
formula which i have used in my own
practice for many years with excellent
results cystex hastens the passage of
over-acid irritants thereby overcoming
a frequent cause of burning itching get-
ting up nights and frequent urination

because it is a special prescription
for poorly functioning kidneys cystex
starts work in  minutes to tone and
soothe sore membranes and brings a
new feeling of energy and vitality in 
hours

dr c z rendelle well-known phy-

dr t a ellis sician and medical examiner of san
francisco recently wrote since the kidneys purify the
blood the poisons collect in these organs and must be
promptly flushed from the system otherwise they re-enter
the blood stream and create a toxic condition i can
truthfully commend the use of cystex

because of its world-wide success in
even the most stubborn cases the doc-
tors prescription called cystex is offered
to sufferers from poorly functioning
kidneys and bladder under the fair-play
guarantee to fix you up to your com-
plete satisfaction or your money back
on return of empty package get cystex
from any druggist and try it under the
money-back guarantee see for your-
self how much younger stronger and
healthier you will feel by using this
special prescription cystex must fix
you up and do the work to your entire nr r  dojdh
satisfaction in  days or cost you noth- ur  l kenoele
ing under the money-back guarantee beware of substi-
tutes and remember that the kidneys are endangered by
drastic irritating drugs or neglect cystex is the only
specially-prepared doctors prescription guaranteed for
kidney dysfunctions tell your druggist you must have
cystex pronounced siss-tex look for it in the black
and red striped package

pphe pig mauler shoves in
hard  his throttle yanks
jjj the reverse lever back and
  i i drills out a ca or brakes
that wakes up the hills the
big drag is racing over the rails and
catapulting downhill into town like a
bat outa hell

  but keep your shirts on fellers
dont even get excited we aint
gonna pile em up or spread em out
over the landscape no siree were
just gonna stop for a little water

  that whistle sure gets a lot of action
youghta see them shacks get a gait
on when they hear it

  end man shoots outa the crummy
cupola like he had dynamite in his
britches and races over the reeling car
roofs head pin tears back over the
tank like hed heard his mother-in-law

was coming to stay tor tne summer
shins up a side ladder and hot-foots
along the running boards

  both of em bucking the wind twist-
ing brakes cussing the hogger what
about who knows who cares

  when the string finally does jerk to
a stop darned if the old kettle aint a
good ten car lengths ahead of the water
tank somethings gonna pop now you
watch

  out of the cab window comes the
head of the hogger maddern a wet
hen he glares wild-eyed at the
shacks

   say whatsa matter you pinhead

railroad stories

this comes from one of the shacks on
a car roof  whatcha spect high-
ballin twenty-five loads down that
hump thirty miles an hour whatcha
reckon we are coupla steam winches 
the hoggfcrs got on a hard-boiled
hat he jerks this off and rams his
fist through the crown  well
whatcha gonna do about it gonna
tote that tank up here or have i gotta
back this whole train up hill to it

   better slack back a little this time
the other brakie hollers  nex time
you make a bum stop well back the
water to you-in an eye-dropper
then everybody laughs and begins
kicking off brake dogs yes theres
a brake wheel on the engine tank too
in those days

  no this incident didnt happen yes-
terday it occurred more than sixty
years ago when i was a kid ten years
old im seventy-two now but in
my minds eye i can still see that dirty
asthmatic diamond-stacked rogers
snorting back and forth trying to get
her mouth under a water spout for her
daily drink

  finally some smart hogger dis-
covers a way out of the  defugalty
stop a few car lengths back of the
water tank uncouple the iron horse
then filling ups easy

back in those days whenever i
heard the locals one long whistle
for our town i started running as fast
as my skinny little legs could travel
you know that train wouldnt get in
and out of woodbury unless i was on
hand to oversee things we met at
the water tank

  that sooty greasy wheezy engine
was the marvel of all creation to me i
gawked at her google-eyed till i knew
by heart every sag and hump and dent
in her rusty battered old jacket

  and that day of all days when the
engineer let me climb up in the cab
heaven came right down to earth at
once of all the shiny doodads dials
and gadgets i was told about steam
gages water glasses gage cocks in-
jectors and blowers but it was too
much for a ten-year-olds head to ab-
sorb in a single lesson

   are you gonna be a railroad man
when you grow up the engineer
asked me

  how clear to me still is his homely
honest face across the span of years
nose with a red plum on it and
whiskers like general grant only
streaked with tobacco juice but to me
he was a king the cab was the court
chamber his seat box was the throne

   yes sir i told him in an awed
fluttery little voice from my perch in
front of the fireman  an ill run an
engine zactly like this then in a
surge to the surface of boyish heart
hunger i bubbled over  gee mr
engineer i gotta three-bladed jackknife
ill give you if youll let me blow the
whistle just oncet

  i never blew the whistle but i did
ring the bell and i kept my knife too
i rode in the cab while we kicked a box
car onto a sidetrack

  my heart oozed out through the
soles of my feet when i climbed down
and bade that old engine good-by two
short whistles and she was off
through the mist in my eyes i watched
her until the caboose disappeared
around a curve in the track but that
little stab of sorrow had its balm and
i was happy again

  to every kid in the town i was a
hero to them i was a superior being
i knew all about engines i could hear
them telling each other  billy jones
rode in the engine and  billy jones
rung the bell and  billy jones is go-
the greatest engineer in the world



ing to be a reglar engineer when hes
a man

  and that wasnt all of it wed sit
on a tie pile beside the hand car shanty
a ring of kids were around me eyes
bugged out like hickory nuts on a limb

   fellers id tell em  im gonna
be the greatest engineer in the world
you watch im gonna run the finest
and fastest train ill have the biggest
and strongest engine ill call her
 shootin star  because theyre the
fastest things there is

   ill run her at night pitch black
ones and in storms too cause you
know the mail and the passengers have
gotta go im sittin up in my cab like
this then id show em how engi-
neers sit and act and id tell em

   kids this is the fast mail and im
runnin er right on the dot my throt-
tles wide open wheels turnin like
lightnin - sixty - seventy - eighty
miles an hour headlights scoopin a
white hole outa the dark im leanin
out the cab winder watchin the track
flyin back at us we tear over crossins
just like nothin we flash past signal
lights zip-zip-zip we fly through
towns never slack speed and the whis-
tle screamin like the mischief 

  by this time every kid was reeling
and lurching and they were all right
up in the cab with me and i said
 winds cuttin my face like a whip
but i gotta keep my eye glued on that
track thousand innocent passengers
back in them coaches every last livin
one of ems trustin the engineer
right there that smart alec fatty
robinson horned in  how about the
fireman billy he looks out his win-
der too dont he

  but i shut him up might quick
 firemen shovel coal they aint got
time to look out winders

   even my whistlell be different i

announced  so when i cut loose with
a zvhoo-oo zvho-o-oo everybodyll
say  here comes billy jones 

reckon i was bit pretty bad by
the railroad bug i raced along
the road trailing a rope till i was
skinny as a snake i was the engineer
also the engine of this fast freight
the rope was my string of rattlers
the knot tied in the end of it was the
caboose

  neighbors finally began to think the
jones kid was only about one flag stop
from the goofy house the family
grindstone and the old sewing-machine
got a lot of exercise id turn every-
thing that had a wheel making believe
i was going places

  as  grew older i pored over every
book on railroads and railroading i
could get hold of i devoured timetables
in railway folders until i knew darned
near every railroad and its stations in
the united states and canada in those
days there avas no international en-
gine picture club but i wish there had
been

  a corner of the granary was my
workshop here i made model en-
gines and cars out of wood with my
three-bladed jackknife and a gimlet i
created switching problems and solved
them i studied cylinder dimensions
steam pressure drive-wheel diameter
and tractive force and their related in-
fluences

  like abraham lincoln when my
time comes i want to be ready at
last i took the first real step in my
great career i went to work in a
railroad roundhouse my job was wip-
ing engines

   it wont be long now till im out
on the road i thought  here in
the roundhouse im up against the real
things-smoke soot steam hot grease


railroad stories

and countless locomotives its where
the engines go to bed

  long lean passenger greyhounds
with drivers higher than my head
built for speed those babies snub-
nosed freight hogs little wheels squat
on the ground made for heavy haul-
ing diamond and straight-shot stacks
with every one poked under a grimy
smoke funnel

  a couple of immense brand new
passenger compounds just arrived
from the rhode island locomotive
works i couldnt stand flat-footed
and reach to the top of their drivers i
stood by and watched em and said

   ill bet theyll make a hundred
miles an hour look like standin still
thems the kind im gonna run some
day

  if either of these compounds were
in the roundhouse when the noon whis-
tle blew id be up in the cab of the
monster with my dinner pail on the
right-hand seatbox every time

  every day there was a big trip some-
where id swing her reverse leaver
forward ease out her throttle a notch
at a time and we were off course she
was stone cold and had blocks under
her wheels but i was going places just
the same all i had to do was pull my
cap on tight lean out the cab window
and watch us swallow up the track
talk about the guy with the seven-
league boots we were making his
best time look like backing up

  here comes a road crossing signal
post flying at us i reach up to the
whistle cord and give her a beautiful
two longs and two shorts not a sound
to a soul but me i hear the blasts all
right

  then a station post flashes past i
take a look down the track  aw
thats only winnipeg or omaha
theyre just flag stops for this train

so we tear through town at  mph
everybodys down to the depot to see
the flight of the limited and engineer
billy jones

  when i shove in the throttle at the
one oclock whistle were in san diego
or vancouver i climb down out of
the cab with my long-nosed oilcan and
feel for hot bearings with the back of
my knuckles like real hoggers do

  next day i gotta bring her back
from san diego or vancouver and put
her in the roundhouse again its great
practice for the real runs ill be mak-
ing some day

gradually the roundhouse
gang began thinking the jones
wiper was cuckoo poked all kinds of
fun at me theyd make a call board
with chalk on the house wall then
theyd write my name in this as engi-
neer on first  that was the crack
passenger train of the road

   let em laugh id say to myself
 some day ill be pulling the throttle
on this same  and these smartiesll
be in the hole watching me zip past

  the hostler was a fine guy named
harry he sure savvied engines but
he never went out on the road harry
brought engines into the roundhouse
off what was called the house track
at first i thought hoggers were either
pretty independent or absent-minded
because they always left their engines
on this house track but the real reason
was they all liked harry and left the
hogs outside so hed have a job

  i helped harry fetch the engines into
the roundhouse and put em to bed
that is id get in the pit and pull the
fire skin up on top and the sand dome
help shove the turntable and block her
drivers when the stack was under the
funnel harry did all the rest

 summer waned and fall came
the greatest engineer in the world



roundhouse air was alive with a new
activity older wipers were sent out
firing engines on grain trains call
boy running his legs off rustling crews
for extra freights chain gang engine-
men-thems the  first in first out 
boys-doing something awful to that
old pay car right now most of em
taking out a drag doubling right back
to find another run waiting em

  im thinkin  ill surely get in on
some of this noontimes now im up
in any old engine shaking a shovel at
the black diamonds so ill have the
swing of the thing when im called

  finally i miss a wiper who is
younger than me on the job and
whacha think i see the big hams
name stuck up on the board as fireman
on an extra run

  do i blow up  say i slam my hand-
ful of greasy waste so hard in the oil
pail it almost dents the bottom of the
bucket in nothing flat im up in the
office of the big gazeek first question
i pop at him is

   does seniority apply to a wiper
 sure he tells me  seniority ap-
plies to everybody except old buck the
sweeper and the roundhouse cat
then i trot out my grievance the
whole things been an oversight and
im sent right up for examination at
last im on my way

  everythings fine so far im hard
as nails and tough as whalebone physi-
cally only one more river to cross-
the eye doc he hands me a strand of
yarn from a skein and tells me to match
it for color this is a leap-pipe cinch
i spot the yarns mate and hand it to
him he looks at me hard and shakes
his head

  great guns ive missed i try again
and again it looks easy but i muff
every chance

  to me its so awful i dont want to

talk about it every dream of my life
shattered knocked flat as a toppled
house of cards at the end of the eye
test i reel out of that room with words
of doom ringing in my ears im hope-
lessly color blind all i can think of
in that jumble is that im a washout
a failure-an engine all steamed up
with both cylinder heads blown out

  in a daze i wander off into woods
back of the shops i couldnt stand
to see any of them hateful smirking
roundhouse smarties theyd know
id hit the skids prone on the ground
i fight it out alone

   ill never run an engine i keep
repeating to myself its like a sen-
tence of death to me to lots of fel-
lows running an engine is just a job
but to me it was the one thing about
which everything else in life centered
and hard luck snatched that away

  at last my thoughts begin to clear
like mist in a marsh before the beams
of the sun somebodys gotta wipe
engines that somebodys me ill
march back to that roundhouse and get
on the old job ill say nothing and
saw wood

  if i cant run an engine i can revel
in grease in soot smoke and steam
if i cant ride into a boys heaven in a
flying engine cab i can still peek into
my lost paradise through the cracks in
the fence

forty years later im still toting
the waste and the oil pail-still
wiping engines the snow of age has
silvered my hair the weight of years
has sagged my shoulders boys at the
roundhouse now call me  old billy
the boss wiper

  i tell em if youre only wipin
engines wipe em right you hoggers
got them little signs in your cabs be-
fore your eyes  be sure youre right


railroad stories

then go ahead well thats how i
wanna wipe engines

  in these forty years ive seen the
boys come and go ive watched em
growup and grow old in the service of
this railroad ive waved em the high
sign as they started out smiling on that
last one-way run-from which they
never came back

  seen a lotta changes too in the
motive power about this ancient round-
house from the little vest-pocket
eight-wheelers of my young days ive
seen em grow into the giant articulated
compounds with as many wheels under
em as a caterpillars got legs

  me and the engines have grown old
together ive watched em being
broken in brand new seen em go to
the back shop for overhaul eyed em
through a mist finally being shunted
down a long sidetrack to that last great
locomotive graveyard known as the
junk pile

  there they stand winter and sum-
mer rain and shine a long funeral pro-
cession of weary worn-out iron horses
-pathetic reminders of a period that
has passed each one has stencilled on
its cab  vacated from equipment
roll and the date it hit the cemetery
that little notice is the old girls
epitaph

  wouldnt be so bad if theyd just
leave em in peace but they leave em
in pieces every time a side rod or
eccentric is wanted down they go to
the engine burial plot and tear an arm
or leg off a corpse its a sin and a
shame so it is

  of course im just a foolish senti-
mental old has-been or never-was i
love to steal down to that graveyard
of rusting iron and rotting wood and
sit in the bare cabs of those half-
stripped engines

  plain as day i hear floating up to me

the long cry of  boa-ard a dozen
car-lengths back i can see the shadowy
outline of a  con  in uniform waving
me the highball

  i tug at her creaky rusty protesting
old throttle i feel her quiver all over
as the steam seeps through her system
and warms her old bones she moves
at first uncertainly like an aged crone
limping on a stick then she slips
away down the rails

  were off out of this limbo of
ghost locomotives back to that past of
pristine engine glory we go what a
grand and glorious ride down the
line rushing roaring shrieking
through the country ninety miles an
hour a long string of  varnished
wagons  trailing behind us mail
grabbed and kicked off on the fly
everything on the road spotted in the
hole as we flash past man oh man
i just dont want to wake up

  and when i do open my eyes dog
gone it we aint budged an inch of
course i knew we wouldnt cause the
girl is short her side rods and both
cylinder heads shes just junk and
i think maybe thats why i come down
here birds of a feather- thats about
all i am junk

i keep thinking that im junk till
the great day the brass collar calls
me over on the carpet that big boys
one swell guy but i was right here
on this job most before he was born

  there i am standing before him and
hes sizing me up from behind a big
desk i aint done nothing i shouldnt
but im getting an awful funny feeling
just the same seems like somebodys
jacked me up taken my legs from
under me and left me standing on
nothin all i can see is that long
string of junk engines and me in the
line
the greatest engineer in the world



 that last great locomotive graveyard known as the junk pile photo by geo v hartman
e park blvd oakland calif who writes  this old abandoned union pacific engine sets
out among the sagebrush in oregon evidently she was not equipped with air brakes as
there is no sign of pump or air hose her main rods were lying in the tender i wonder
what she thinks out there alone in the desert and where are the hands that once pulled

her throttle

   and why not i tell myself  you
cant go on here forever the engines
dont the old the decrepit the worn
out among humanity are stencilled
 vacated from equipment roll same
as the engines thats life

  then i hear the big boy spieling
 billy how long have you waited to
run an engine

  i can feel the bad news coming  all
my life i tell him

  then he pops at me quick  howd
you like to run a real honest-to-good-
ness smoke-spouting steam-spitting
passenger locomotive 

  i start for my bandanna to wipe the
cold sweat off my bald spot im think-
ing id better start talking fore the
cat gets my tongue so i sail in

  if youre pokin fun at me mr
thoms please lets josh some other
way im giving him my old round-
house grin but im eyeing him in
earnest

   but im not poking fun at you
billy says the big brass hat  i
mean every word im saying you can
throw a reverse lever cant you

  im nodding the old bean

   and you can read a steam gage
work an injector ring a bell jerk a
whistle cord and pull a throttle 

   to this string of questions my heads
wagging answers like its on a hinge
 sure mr thoms ive ran an engine
a million miles but its all been in my
dreams

   well you can wake up now says
he  youre a real hoghead writh a
regular run from today on come on
ill introduce you to your new battle-
ship and string of passenger coaches
but i just stand there like a gilly
and gawk at him maybe im afraid
that if i move ill find its only another
dream  you-you know my trouble
mr thoms you know why ive spent
my life in the roundhouse did you
know that i cant read signals-that
im color blind

    dont worry about that billy ill
fix everything for you and he did

so here i am running a tom thumb
train on a miniature railway at an
amusement park taint zactly like the


railroad stories

great wheeled greyhound fleeting
across country with a dozen pullmans
that i dreamed of running when i was
a kid but shes a real little engine
and she suits me you know after
lifes kicked you in the seat of the
pants for half a century it dont take
so much to satisfy you

  in a sense this railroads distinctive
its strictly a one-man road and im
the man im the section crew train
dispatcher fireboy engineer brake-
man conductor hostler wiper and car
toad

  only one station on the entire sys-
tem too thats where all the kids
pile on and off but ive got that track
strung out clean across the country
and its a scenic system we got the
royal gorge the grand canyon the
high sierras-and that whole mile of
tin rocks down yonder with a sign on
it that says dont kiss your girl in
this tunnel thats the moffat tunnel

   i	collect the kids tickets ring the bell
from my seat back on the water tank
and as we pull out i holler  good-
by old new york when we come
around to the same spot again i make
a regular passenger train stop-just
ease em up to the platform then i

yell san francisco last stop
everybody out

  this makes a hit with the kids and
thats what im here for ive loved
kids all my life id planned a lot of
things like marriage a home and a
family id even figured out a little
whistle toot for the end of the run so
the folks d know dad was cornin
home

  them dreams all went with the
others cause- well shucks i aint
kicking but you cant do a whole lot
on a wipers wages

  after the last trips made i run my
iron shetland pony in her stall for the
night then i sit down all alone for a
long while and admire the little rascal
shes the banty rooster of the engine
family got everything her big sisters
have cept size   

  sfnd thats the way they found the
old man when he failed to take
out his train he was sitting in a cor-
ner of his tiny roundhouse facing his
engine smiling in his sleep and speed-
ing across the vast reaches of infinite
space at the throttle of some celestial
locomotive was the freed soul of the
greatest engineer in the world

ing out of chicago were getting tired of spending so much
of their time off duty polishing brass consequently they or-
ganized a grievance committee and made arrangements for a
conference with the general superintendent of motive power
the next time he was in chicago in those days each engi-
neer was assigned a regular locomotive and naturally he tried
to take very good care of it some even spent their own
money putting on extra brass plating one engineer whom ill call jim turcell was
operating a regular passenger run out of chicago with no  his pride in this loco-
motive was his besetting sin being a wealthy man he could afford to lavish a great
amount of money dolling her up wherever possible he installed brass and even paid
his fireman extra money to keep this brass polished his was the grandest locomotive
running into chicago she was envied and talked about a great deal by engine crews
of all railroads running into the same station

    however when the firemens grievance committee was in conference with the gen-
eral superintendent of motive power it did not inform him of the real motive which
was to get out of the job of polishing brass but told him the men wanted more money
the superintendent said he did not think they were justified and pointed out that the
men on the pennsylvania and the lake shore  michigan southern were getting the
same rate of pay and seemed to be satisfied the grievance committee then submitted
the fact they had more brass to polish than the firemen of the other lines which duty
required three to four hours before leaving on their runs the superintendent then sug-
gested they discontinue the brass work on the locomotives that was just what the
committee wanted so before the meeting was over it was agreed that all the brass
work except the bell would be painted black

    the superintendent did not live in chicago and did not know how old jim purcell
loved the  furthermore if he did know it would not have made any difference
when the roundhouse foreman was instructed to have the painting done he asked if
this order included the  the superintendent replied that the order was given for
all engines and added that he did not see why any exception should be made for the 

    it was a hot afternoon in july when the painters got busy they started on the
 eight or ten of the firemen gathered around the roundhouse to watch the fun
someone delivered the news to jim purcell jim lost no time getting to the round-
house when he arrived coat in one hand and straw hat in the other there on the out-
going track stood the  with two painters just about to daub up the flag holders

    something happened to old jim he ran for the master mechanics office nearly
knocking the hinges off the door getting in with the master mechanic sat the general
superintendent of motive power jim had now a full head of steam and was aoout
ready to pop but seeing the big boss he cooled down somewhat on being asked if
this was the way he usually came into the master mechanics office jim answered no
but added that something terrible was going on they are painting the brass work
on my engine black i

    realizing the situation and being a real railroader the super said  you dont
mean to tell me that someone is painting the brass work on your engine black
without your knowledge let us look into-it

   the three of them started down towards the outgoing track when the  was
in sight jim pointed to the painters on it and yelled  there is my engine with all
the brass work painted black

   the superintendent feigned surprise saying oh this is the engine you were
referring to mr purcell let me show you something walking around to the ten-
der he pointed to the letters on it do you see those letters well they stand for
baltimore  ohio and this engine is the property of the railroad furthermore i am
the man who ordered the brass work painted black

    old jims grief was heart-breaking and for two years thereafter he never talked
to any of the firemen who were on that grievance committee-elmer f miller

  our railroads are up against it although they have developed the cheapest
  transportation the world has ever known they are being bled by competition
  which is both inefficient and costly-the competition of trucks and busses this
  sounds impossible but it is true the facts are plain and they do not lie even if
  highway transportation may cost less in the beginning it costs infinitely more in the
  long run in this and other articles we are showing you why this is so-the editors

you pay more to ship by truck

            by george l phillips

ext time you happen to
go near a railroad main
line track stay there and
wait for a loaded fast
freight train to come by
watch it and count the cars you may
get to a hundred before the caboose
reaches you then stop and reflect
you are seeing  or more tons of
goods manned by five well-paid em-
ployees being hauled by an engine
which uses only  cents worth of coal
every mile you are looking at efficient
economical mass transportation

  then turn around and watch the
highway all too soon you will see
a big wide truck come lumbering
along exhaust belching gears moaning
as it tackles a grade and a mile-long
line of passenger cars behind it wait-
ing for a chance to pass it is run by
one badly underpaid man and is haul-
ing perhaps between five and ten tons
at a cost of almost two cents a mile
for gasoline to say nothing of oil

  stop and reflect
again a half min-
utes figuring will tell
you that it would take
 such trucks to
haul the load the
freight train is haul-
ing it would also

take  men and the gasoline bill
would be somewhere between  and
 a mile how is it then you ask
yourself that this truck can be and is
competing with the railroad without
having all the figures in the problem
you tell yourself that there is some-
thing wrong somewhere

  youre right there is in our last
issue we told you how trucks can take
unnatural advantage of the railroads
and how the economy of shipping by
truck is in the long run no economy at
all in future issues we intend to go
further into this matter but what we
want to tell you now is that when you
pay less to ship by truck you are actual-
ly paying more-not alone in the form
of taxes or in the form of decreased
purchasing power of transportation
employees but in good cold u s
cash

 the average rate for shipping
freight by rail is about one cent a ton
per mile but the lowest rate which
trucks can charge and
meet expenses is four
or five cents a ton
per mile - in other
words four or five
times as much as the
average railroad rate
whats more the

         from ry purchases dc stores
the railroad blues

truck rate would have
to be much higher if
its drivers were given
decent wages and if
the trucks paid a fair
charge for the use of
the highways

  how then do the
trucks get the busi-
ness if their rates
are so much higher
than those of the rail-
roads w h y should
anyone use them  the
answer is simple

they do not compete
with average railroad
rates but with specific
railroad rates which
are higher than average the railroad
rate structure built up under rigid
commission regulation was designed
to serve the interests of the public the
authorities have always encouraged
very high rates on light and valuable
articles with the understanding that
in return the railroads must offer cor-
respondingly low raus on heavy and
low-valued stuff

  let us see how this works out the
average rate is about one cent a ton
per mile now the commission has
said to the railroads we will let you
charge ten cents a ton per mile on
mens suits if you will cut the rate on
a ton of coal to eight mills ten mills
make one cent a mile

  suppose a suit of clothes weighs five
pounds  suits to the ton and that
it travels  miles the freight
charge on each suit will be  y cents
if the rate charged were the average
rate one cent a ton per mile the
freight on each suit would be only  y
cents this policy thus costs the
purchaser of a suit a little more than

	cents

  but how has it affected his coal bill
reduction of the rate on coal goes
with the higher rate on suits if the
coal moves  miles and it moves for
eight instead of ten mills a mile  is
saved on every ton of coal

  ten or eleven cents extra freight
on the price of a suit is a lot easier to
pay than  extra on a ton of coal
that is why the freight rate structure
was built up this way-to serve the
public interest by making charges heav-
ier where they will not be felt and by
lightening the burden where it is
hard

but what does the truck do does
it come along and offer to take
all freight at the average railroad rate
it does not it takes only that freight
for which the railroads charge much
higher than the average rates trucks
cannot haul low-rate stuff even if
they could they wouldnt want to they
would lose money doing so

  as soon as the high-rated traffic goes
to trucks the railroads have to raise
the rates on low-rated traffic to keep


railroad stories

the average rate from falling that
is exactly the reason for the rate in-
crease petition which was recently up
before the interstate commerce com-
mission

  people can afford to pay ten cents
extra for a suit of clothes or a cent
more a pound for meat if by doing this
they can save dollars in the price of
fuel building materials etc but they
cannot save the pennies and the dollars
too they have been saving the pen-
nies by shipping by truck now the
railroads have had to ask for an in-
crease in rates which were so low in
the first place that the trucks could not
begin to compete with them

  when it costs only one cent on the
average to ship by rail and four cents
or more to ship by truck and still the
traffic is diverted to truck anyone can
see what is ahead of us there is a
difference of three cents a ton per mile
which somebody is going to pay that
somebody is air public the ultimate
consumer and it is about time he
woke up to the fact

  remember every time you see a
long-haul truck moving a load of
freight which could be handled by rail
tell yourself that it is waste for which
someone is going to pay heavily that
someone is you

  and let us repeat this is not all the
story of the gold-brick  economy  of
truck transportation when the shipper
pays a freight bill to the railroad the
transaction is complete when he pays
it to a truck his expense has just be-
gun he has to pay taxes to maintain
the road the truck uses since every
truck shipment reduces railroad earn-
ing power and the ability of the rail-
roads to pay taxes the assessments on
other property owners must be in-
creased to make up the difference so
the man who ships by truck pays his
freight bill once to the truck operator
and twice to the tax collector

  the truck has -a proper place in
short-haul transportation since much
freight has to be loaded on it to be
taken to the railroad the greater cost
of truck operation may be offset in
short hauls by the saving in the cost of
loading and unloading there are
plenty of such movements up to  or
 miles and in some cases even
greater distances where the truck real-
ly represents economy

  but long hauls over the highway are
not economy they represent waste of
the most extravagant kind-waste
which is carried on at the expense of
every consumer and taxpayer in the
country
running into the
ticket office i
collide with a
dark figure

life begins

on the 

by the
engine picture kid

even on the happy valley railroad its
a long worm that has no turning

paa- big burly fellow gives me
a shove as he crashes into
the cab of our little old-
i ii i fashioned jack-the pride
and only locomotive of the
happy valley railroad the moose
slaps a lunch box down on the floor
plates he slings a brown satchel over
on the engineers seatbox then he
drags out a pair of overalls and starts
changing his clothes in the warmth of
the open firebox door it being a cold
winter day in the saskatchewan prairie
country a light snow is falling

  this stranger sure wasnt at the end
of the line when they handed out
nerve but as the old saying goes its
a long worm that has no turning

which is true even on our -mile
pike canadas shortest man-sized rail-
road

   hey i yell  you cant undress
here aint you got no respect for a

lady

   a lady-in an engine cab who-
you he laughs like a fool

  no i aint the lady i snap back
with flaming indignation  goldenrod
higgins daughter of the president of
this road wheels the  and shell
be along any minute shes a bona
fide hogger

  my my the fool pulls up his
overalls and slips the straps over his
shoulders boneyfide goldie sure
was boney last time i seen her a


railroad stories

skinny long-legged kid eatin bread an
jam with jam smeared all over her
freckled mug

  you know miss higgins i ask

   know her  the big guy grins
 we used to play around the c p
yards in vancouver together were
pals thick as that he crosses two
fingers

  naturally as i am engaged to gold-
enrod myself there is other people i
would rather see than him in plain-
view the main terminus of hardshell
higgins happy valley line

  while i am thinking goldenrod
climbs into the cab both leather gaunt-
lets clasped in her left hand she stares
at the stranger a moment then rushes
to him

  jim she exclaims grabbing his
hand then turns to me  kid i
want you to meet my cousin jim
kelly

   yeah says the big goof  thats
me an if i do say it myself the best
fireman in canada goldie whos
this fellow

   why says goldenrod  i thought
you knew thats the engine picture
kid

  jim shakes his head  a picture
nut huh he fixes his eyes on my
international engine picture club but-
ton  i been seein those buttons on
guys all over the country

  with that he moves over to the
right hand seatbox and begins talking
to goldenrod i have a feeling that
jim and myself aint going to get along
very well together

  this feeling increases when golden-
rod gets her highball from the con and
the  starts rolling down happy
valley with jim kelly still in the cab
and a curtain of snow beating against
the cab windows

  this kelly guy has many irons in the

fire besides railroading i learn that he
has come to saskatchewan only because
of a temporary slump in business

  to bad i gotta bump you kid
he says to me  but i got seniority
on this job straight from old man
higgins himself

  goldenrod is leaning out the cab
window watching the snow she dont
say anything a queer lump rises in
my throat because i have become very
fond of firing this jack with my girl
friend at the throttle which i been
doing practically since hardshell hig-
gins bought the happy valley line five
or six months ago so i keep wishing
jim kellys business had kept him out
of plainview

  when we get down to valley park
at the other end of the line jim buttons
up his coat and leaves the cab to look
around the depot and i ease over
toward goldenrod and tap her on the
shoulder

   whats on your mind she says
but i guess she knew because be-
fore i get a chance to tell her she says
 im afraid its true rule one in
dads book of regulations for the h
v is that only members of the family
shall be employed he wrote aunt
matilda a long time ago that jim was
marked up for fireman

   still- i begin

  goldenrod gives me a smile and
says were just engaged kid
technically youre not actually in the
family-yet

  jim kelly barges along and we shove
back for plainview funny but all
the way back the coal scoop weighs a
ton and the slice bar has got so heavy
i can hardly lift it besides it dont
make matters any better to have jim
not only telling goldenrod what a swell
fireman he is but also that he will teach
her new tricks about engine driving
life begins on the 



  i decide to have a showdown when
we pull into plainview i swing from
the cab and head for the h v execu-
tive offices over the depot on railroad
avenue where icicles is hanging down
over the windows

   run along and peddle your pic-
tures says jim watching me go

  hardshell higgins who was a
boomer hogger before he bought his
own pike and settled down meets me
at the door all excited

   hello son he says  have a
cigar congratulate me youre canned
i got a real fireman on the h v now
my sister matildas oldest boy jim

   but mr higgins- i says

   i know it i know it snaps
hardshell  the kellys were always
shanty people socially while us hig-
ginses are lace curtain irish but jims
a smart lad theres a lot of higgins
in him

  i have to listen to family history be-
fore i can explain i am not very
anxious to leave engine service on the
h v railroad at this particular time

   nonsense says hardshell  you
need more experience hit the boomer
trail see canada get a load of the
yellowhead pass where the c n r
enters british columbia great coun-
try out there

  it is useless for me to tell the old
coot that i would rather be a home
guard and stick around close to his
daughter under the circumstances

hardshell wont listen to rea-
son so i return to goldenrod
disconsolately who is still in the engine
cab which bears her name

   did dad fire you she asks softly

  yes i says so i quit ill
stick around though until the end of
the week when i draw my time

  she looks at me kind of funny

there is a mist of tears in her eyes
 youre a swell guy she says  ill
miss you a lot and some day youre
coming back with a lot of money and
well get married wont we kid

   you bet we will i says  but i
aint gone yet

  later old man higgins is passing
by where i live on dominion street
second floor back and he drops in to
see me shakes the snow off his big
fur coat and says

   kid i been thinking things over
and if you say the word i can give you
a job temporary for a few days in an-
other branch of railroad service

  that is like asking a condemned man
if he would be interested in a reprieve
 did jim quit i says hopefully

   no says hardshell  but my sta-
tion agent at plainview has got a case
of pneumonia can you sell tickets
 i can try i says

  of course selling tickets is a lot
harder job than firing an iron horse
because there is more arithmetic in-
volved and it dont make matters any
better to have jim kelly hanging
around our nice warm station on cold
days and telling me what a good fire-
man he is

  still it enables me to solve a mystery
that develops pretty soon as far as the
finances of the happy valley is con-
cerned the passenger business booms
very suddenly only the ticket receipts
dont show any improvement

  higgins is pretty mad about it too
because that is not the way to run a
railroad

   youre a fine bird to handle
funds he growls  i might have
knowrn it what do you do every night 
throw the money up in the air and
give the company all that sticks to the
ceiling

   no  says  i never thought of


railroad stories

that system and i must say it dont
sound very efficient from a company
standpoint

   it aint snaps hardshell  look
at this

  he shows me a big pile of ticket
stubs and an audited list of receipts
the two dont tally there is twice as
many tickets sold as money received

   you aint been having any cut-rate
sales on transportation have you

   no i says still studying the fig-
ures  it looks like somebody is steal-
ing the tickets and selling them out-
side

   it does says hardshell grimly
 and there aint anybody handles the
tickets but you and me there aint
any agent at valley park

   hmm i says  that makes one
of us a thief dont it mr higgins
and i know it aint me

  the way old man higgins carries
on you would of thought i had in-
sulted him or something nevertheless
in spite of all his raving he leaves me
something to think about saying that
if any more tickets is missing he will
have me thrown in jail in addition to
being fired

  he seems to have overlooked the
fact that i am engaged to his daughter
and such an action would cause a lot
of gossip in plainview

   besides he says storming out of
the depot and letting in a cold draft
through the open door  that smart
nephew of mine jim kelly says its
only natural that if you were clever
enough youd want to make yourself a
little extra money to travel on so youd
have it when my regular station agent
comes back

as time goes on tickets keep being
- picked up by old amos chutney
the passenger con that i have never

sold according to the money in the till
i figure that the regular station agent
aint so sick but what he can work a
racket and clean up a little money on
the side without getting blamed for it

  one morning as i open the office i
notice that someone has been in during
the night because i had stuck a little
piece of paper in the door jamb when i
locked up the night before and it
dropped to the floor

  so i spend most of the day rigging
up a scheme to catch the thief maybe
if i do i can hold the station agent job
permanent at plainview

   ill have the crook for you in the
morning mr higgins i says when he
comes in you have nothing to
worry about

  is that so retorts hardshell
 well you try operating a railroad
these days even just three and a half
miles and see what ive got to worry
about

    no i says  i will stick to selling
tickets for the present although i
cant help thinking to myself that some
day me and goldenrod will inherit the
h v pike after the old man retires if
it hasnt gone out of business by then
or merged with the canadian national

  that night i set my trap carefully
and after i am supposed to have gone
home to dominion street i sneak back
into the darkened depot on railroad
avenue and hide behind a bench in the
waiting room outside of a few mice
running around the place nothing hap-
pens until after midnight

  i am about to fall asleep when i
hear the door to the baggage room
creak open naturally i am on my
toes a floor board squeaks and a
dark figure makes for the ticket office

  the next instant there is a crash and
a blinding flash of white hot light in
two jumps i am running into the ticket
life begins on the 	

office the black maelstrom seems
doubly dark after the moments bright
light but i collide with the intruder
right at the door

   got you i says trying to throw
my arms around him  so you told
mr higgins you had pneumonia eh
to throw dust in his eyes

  i drag him down to the floor like a
football player i am not one to let
go my hold although a heavy rain of
blows is showered on my face then
i get a heavy boot on the chin from
this thief who doubles up his legs and
kicks out like a mule while i am
trying to shake my head clear the
crook gets up

  i stagger to my feet also and grope
for the switchlight something de-
scends on my head that feels like it was
the chair by the agents desk or maybe
the desk itself through the shower
of stars that twinkle through my brain
i cannot tell very good it might even
have been the depot roof

  anyhow when i finally come to
there is a lump on my head as big as
a signal light but my mind is very
clear i fumble around for the lights

  the crook has gone and of course
i am very sorry that i did not capture
him but at the same time quite relieved
to find that none of the tickets have
been stolen from the rack of course
being the regular agent he knew per-
fectly well where they were kept

  i have just finished counting them
when i hear a commotion outside
there is several people have come
down to the depot and among the
voices i recognize old man higgins
and his nephew jim kelly

   see that uncle hardshell says
jim  i told you all along that kid
was taking the tickets robbin a poor
honest railroad president of his hard-
earned money thats what hes doin

  naturally after the fight i have just
put up to catch the real thief i am
more than a little burned up i do not
feel any better when hardshell and
jim storm into the room with a police
officer

  look says jim pointing at me
 caught with the goods this time sit-
tin over there countin tickets

   yep says hardshell sadly  try-
ing to get even with me for firing him
trying to break the h v before he
left wait till goldenrod hears about
this

  mr higgins i says youre
making a big mistake i was just
counting the tickets

  at this time of night sneers
hardshell  its lucky jim happened
to be up and saw the agents office all
lighted up

   yeah says jim he turns to the
bluecoat  officer arrest that man

a sudden light dawns on me
 wait a minute i says looking
at jim kelly  how about jim mr
higgins  what was he doing around
the station at night

kelly laughs  lookin for the guy
stealin uncles tickets he beams at
hardshell  an i guess i found him
 gee i says  that makes two of
us but he got away

   who got away  snaps hardshell
 the crook  says then i tell
him about my fight and show him the
lump on my head

   no soap says jim kelly  that
story sure sounds fishy to me dont
it copper he probably stumbled an
cracked his head on something sharp
prowlin around in the dark

  thus i am in a bad jam all on ac-
count of trying to help out hardshell
higgins

   all right i says  if you guys


railroad stories

dont believe me catch your own crooks
after this im through

   and how says jim he nods to
the policeman who pulls a pair of
handcuffs out of a back pocket  slip
the bracelets on him

   gosh i says to hardshell  mr
higgins you dont think i really-
take him away says hardshell
turning from me  poor goldenrod
 that guy looked like a crook to
me from the first day i seen him says
jim and the officer gives me a shove

  i have slept on a lot better beds than
they have in the plainview calaboose
and i must say i am not feeling very
good in the morning when the warden
comes in with a sickly looking break-
fast which he slops down on a trap in
front of me

   want a lawyer he says

  what for i says im inno-
cent

   oh sure sure says the warden
slipping me the wink  they all are
just the same theres a feller named
slivowitz thatll get you out if any-
body can he takes all the tough
cases

   well i says  i aint a tough
case i was just trying to do my future
father-in-law a good turn

   o k the warden says cheerfully
locking the cell door and leaving me
inside  i dont blame you for tryin
its gettin caught that lands you in
trouble as he starts to leave he
calls back dont forget slivowitz
that warden i thinks to myself
must be getting a rake-off from slivo-
witz

from where i am looking out
through three little bars at a streak
of sunlight i must say the old boomer
trail looks pretty good to me i can
hear the  train whistle on her trip

down to valley park to bring the com-
muters back to plainview

  i wonder what goldenrod is think-
ing about as she grips the throttle of
the little fast-stepping jack maybe she
is sorry she ever became engaged to
me because i know things look very
bad

  about ten oclock i am surprised by
the warden announcing that i have a
visitor but shes not allowed to enter
the cell it is goldenrod looking at
me through the iron bars

   kid she says quietly  how in
the devil did you get in this mess

   gee i says stammering slightly
 then you-you dont believe i stole
those tickets

   of course not silly now start at
the beginning and tell me everything
dads so quick tempered he makes
snap judgments sometimes and hes
not always right

  i start at the beginning telling her
all about the trap i set to catch the
crook and how instead of him being in
jail it is me that is on the inside look-
ing out goldenrod shakes her head
very gloomily

   just like you she says  what
happened to the camera you fixed on
the shelf to get a picture of the thief
when he stepped over to the ticket rack
and set the flashlight off

   gosh goldenrod i says  ive
been so worried since i have been ar-
rested i forgot all about it its there
yet i guess

  goldenrods eyes brighten  wait
here she says  ill be back

  it is a long time until she returns
finally she arrives outside the cell door
again

   ive had the plate developed she
breezes  it turned out fine a regu-
lar portrait shows the thief with his
hands right on the ticket rack
life begins on the 



   i know i says  i measured the
distance carefully its the regular
station agent i knew all along he was
the crook

  goldenrod shakes her pretty blond
head and replied

   no it was cousin jim

  jim i gasp in surprise

 yes she says i thought hed
been acting queer lately him and his
big business talk the girl tosses her
curls  dad showed him the picture
you took and made him confess jim
returned the money he had stolen hes
leaving town tonight

   gee i says  its sweet of you

to get me out of jail the grub here
aint so good

 goldenrod squeezes my hand
through the bars  your camera did
it she explains with a bright smile
 after all she adds  what would
people think a higgins engaged to a
jailbird and as for the grub-well
when we get married-

  at this juncture the warden comes
up behind goldenrod his rusty key
turns the lock and goldenrod and i
arm in arm go back through the snow
to the little roundhouse of the happy
valley line tomorrow morning life
would begin anew on the 

    the passenger engine speaks

       im standing in the station with the limited in tow

       its dark and cold and snowing hard the winds begun to blow

the hogger climbs into my cab the air-brakes have been tried

    he is strapping on his goggles all ready for the ride

his hand is on the throttle and the tallows shoveling coal

    my headlight flashes on and my bell begins to toll

when the skipper comes alongside as mad as he can be

    and what he says to my boss takes the heart clean out of me

for he hollers that weve got to wait a quarter of an hour

    to accommodate some brass-hat boy the old mans look is sour

the tallow flings the firedoors wide and slams his shovel down

    and says oh why the hell dont they let us out of tovrn

so for all those fifteen minutes we wait and wait and wait

    for some congressman or other who doesnt care if we are late

but fve got to make the time whether we start late or not

    for if i dont at the other end the boss goes on the spot

then the old cab signal blows and my throttle is pulled back

    the switch lights change to green giving us an open track

the station has moved backward and im bumping through the yards

then were tearing through the suburbs and out across the plain

    the wind is howling through my wheels the snow has changed to rain
the track is wet and slimy and before me is a hill

  is steam on its way out

to read the newspapers these days youd think that the old iron horse was on her
last legs and that she will be replaced by intemal-combustion engines within ten
years some editorial writers say it would pay to run all steam locomotives on the
scrap heap and build a whole new army of diesel engines even the  new york
times  thinks all our railroads will have to replace their present passenger equip-
ment with streamlined diesel-powered gas buggies as soon as they can get rid of the
old junk it is very worried about the fact that railroads have so much steam equip-
ment on hand they wont be able to buy the new era trains for years

    well remember that the newspapers said wed all be rich by  and flying
to work by  remember too that newspaper editorial writers know as much about
motive power as a kid knows about thermodynamics they pick up their papers and
read that the spurlingtons  breezee the newest thing in gas-electric trains could
travel to hell and back on what it costs to run a steam train from san francisco to los
angeles immediately they sit down and knock out very very sad articles proving that
steam is on its way out

    but is it the answer simply depends on which type of power is cheaper

    few people have attempted to discuss this matter as it should be discussed with
no guessing no tearing of hair no ballyhoo doing so is a scientific process it calls
for lots of knowledge and plenty of clear thought-for consideration of all the factors
and not merely one within the last few years a few authorities have tackled the sub-
ject but apparently the editorial writers havent read anything about them one of
the best recent articles on the subject one which makes an honest intelligent discussion
of all factors appears in the current issue of  baldwin locomotives it is  motive
power for high speed service by r p johnson it takes up the points for and
against diesel and intemal-combustion power but it does not stop there it deter-
mines just what it will cost as compared to steam power and why it will cost just that

    in the first place any high-wheeled steam locomotive can be built to run as fast
with the same load as any diesel or intemal-combustion engine it also has the advan-
tage of being able to be uncoupled from one train of cars to another which diesel-
powered streamlined engines built so far have not such trains cannot even adjust
themselves to volume of traffic moreover internal-combustion engines of all kinds
cannot run at low speeds and must use either a gear shift as in the case of the auto-
mobile or electrical transmission which such trains use today this is expensive to
buy and maintain although they accelerate faster up to  mph they take much
longer to climb to higher speeds a modern steam train can attain  mph only  min-
utes after starting whereas an intemal-combustion train requires at least twice as
long and in some cases  times as long on the other hand intemal-combustion trains
weigh less carry enough fuel for long trips and are more efficient

    granted all these advantages and disadvantages which is cheaper

    there are ten items by which we can compare steam with diesel or intemal-com-
bustion power  fuel  water  lubrication  supplies  engine house ex-
pense  crews wages  repairs to locomotive  interest on book value 
amortization  taxes and insurance

    lets take up each of these items see how they compare and estimate from them the
entire cost of operating both steam and internal-combustion trains for an average mile

    suppose says mr johnson both types of power are run daily between two cities
 miles apart over fairly level country on a schedule of  hours the steam train
would be composed of six cars and engine the internal-combustion train of six cars
one of them the motive power unit the steam train would not be streamlined would
weigh  tons  for engine and tender  for  cars the internal-combustion
train would be fully streamlined would weigh  tons because of greater weight
and lower thermal efficiency the steam engine would have to develop  horsepower
more than twice that of the intemal-combustion engine  to maintain the serv-
ice  days a year two trains of each kind would be necessary thus each train would
run about  miles a year the following figures apply to such ajear

    first of all the steam train will require  worth of coal  tons at 
a ton whereas the internal-combustion train will use only   per mile worth
of oil this is what gets newspaper writers all excited round one for diesel

	 r
is steam on its way out



    second cost of water for the steam engine would be   gals at tf
per  gals for the mternal-combustion practically nothing found two lor diesel

    third cost of lubrication for the steam engine would be  for the internal-com-
bustion  steams round all the way

fourth supplies for both trains will amount to  for the year even up here

    fifth enginehouse expense will amount to  for steam and  for internal-
combustion or deisel on a basis of  fz round trips at  per turn-around for steam
and  for the other diesel is way ahead here

    sixth crews wages on basis of  a mile for fireman and engineman will come
to  for both types two men arc necessary in the cab of an internal-combustion
train this round is also even up

    seventh total maintenance cost of entire steam train including  for the cars
at ti a mile will be  of the internal-combustion train  also in-
cluding  for  cars quite a spread indeed these figures are reliable for there
are enough diesel switchers in use right now to afford a basis of comparison even
allowing for the fact that internal-combustion passenger engines will require less for
repair than switchers the above figures are conservative steams round again

    eighth interest on investment will be  for steam train and  for the
ether why the steam train costs  the diesel  this is figured at
 per cent assuming the economic life of the steam engine will be  years the cars
 years and the entire internal-combustion train  years economic life is the num-
ber of years service during which the total cost of an engine reaches its lowest
yearly average round eight for steam

    ninth amortization the amount of original cost charged off each year will be
 for the steam train  for engine and  for cars and  for
the other this is done by simply dividing cost by economic life steam again

    tenth taxes and insurance will be  for the steam train and  for the
internal-combustion train this is figured on a basis of  per cent of value last
round for steam

    diesel is still going but looks pretty groggy now lets add up the points and
see who won the totals for a -mile year are  for steam and 
for internal combustion or less than - a mile for steam and more than  a mile
for internal combustion these figures do not sound like a death-knell for steam

    remember too that the steam train we imagine is not streamlined is pulling
-ton cars and uses a pacific type engine undoubtedly lighter weight and stream-
lining would help it and as mr johnson concludes  it can be made quite as bizarre-
looking as any high-speed internal-combustion train

    on oct -  the union pacifics -horsepower -car diesel-powered
streamlined train ran between los angeles and new york city  miles in a little
less than  hours its fuel cost about lz a mile  miles a gal at tf a gal or
about  for the trip

    but suppose we look into the matter we find that a -car steam train such as we
described above could be built to run as fast it would use on such a trip no more than
 tons of coal including terminal and stard-by fuel at about  a ton the dif-
ference although great cannot make up for the other costs glance at the above fig-
ures again and you will see that the deisel train would be more expensive if its fuel
cost nothing

    soon the railroads and the public will have a chance to see both types in serice
the ealtimore  ohio is going to run two streamlined -car passenger trains one
diesel and the other steam between washington d c and new york the milwaukee
road has ordered two steam streamlined trains to compete with the burlingtons diese
streamlined trains which will travel between chicago and minneapolis when they get
going well see whether or not steam is on its way out

the true story of a wartime disaster
caused by one little box oi pills

  by e j baker

ittle things are always
important in the railroad
game a broken bolt is

jhf more than a broken bolt it

is a portent of disaster an
insignificant act is more than it ap-
pears to be it may lead up to terrible
consequences such was the case of
the worst circus wreck in railroad his-
tory it was caused by a box of kid-
ney pills

the accident occurred just before
sunrise of june   on the michi-

gan central at ivanhoe indiana a
suburb of chicago at  am the
second section of the westbound
hagenbeck-wallace circus train left
michigan city indiana with orders to
take the gary  western at ivanhoe
the train consisted of engine no
 seven stock cars fourteen flat
cars four sleepers and a caboose all
except the caboose being the property
of the circus company

this train was in charge of con-
ductor r w johnson and engine-

man gasper trainmaster f s whip-
ple was riding the caboose

  the circus was to play lhat day at
hammond indiana most of the per-
formers worn out from their labor of
the previous day were sleeping sound-
ly in their berths all of the cars were
wooden the sleeping cars were re-
built pullmans with steel platforms
and with some berths three deep they
were illuminated by oil lanterns hung
in the center no other lights being per-
mitted

  charles dollmer manager of the
show was sitting up checking over the
days books while his wife lay asleep
in their berth hercules navarro
nationally famed strong man was
snoring loudly joe coyle clown also
was asleep he had no foreboding that
nis wife and two babies would meet
death at his side and that he would
sob i wish i could have died with
them

  the train was loafing along at about
 miles an hour slowed up by a cau-
tion signal east of ivanhoe and came
to a stop at  am in answer to a
signal from conductor johnson who
had noticed a hot box on one of the
fiat cars loaded with circus equipment
engineman gasper stopped with his
locomotive pilot just a few feet from
the elgin joliet  eastern crossing

  trainmaster whipple dozing in the
caboose awoke with a jerk to see the
headlight of a speeding locomotive
boring a hole through the darkness
but not thinking at the moment that
it could possibly be on the same track

meanwhile an empty troop

train in charge of conductor l
johnson and engineer alonzo k
sargent had left michigan city at
 am  minutes after departure
of the circus special this train con-

sisted of engine no  and  steel
pullmans

  the night was clear and signal lamps
were burning brightly jogging along
at between  and  miles an hour
the troop train passed the automatic
signal two miles east of ivanhoe which
was set at caution it passed the next
signal red as crimson without even
slowing down it passed flagman
timm of the circus train although
timm swung his red lantern franti-
cally lighted a fusee and flung the
burning fusee at the cab window as the
 thundered by

  ignoring every possible danger sig-
nal the  plowed into the rear of
the circus extra the wooden circus
cars crumpled up like paper and al-
most immediately burst into flame
from the oil lamps

  clowns bareback riders trapeze per-
formers and acrobats many of them
veterans of the  big top perished in
the crash that had come too sudden
for them to escape many were suf-
focated or burned to death a total of
 men and women answered the last
call in that wreck and  others were
injured

  miss rose roseland a bareback rid-
er whose salary was  a year
was crushed to death in her berth the
ballet of one hundred dancing girls was
decimated among the other victims
were the rooney family of bareback
riders the meyer family of animal

dying was w p robinson -a con-

flagman timm of the circus train swung his
red lantern frantically at the oncoming 
and then flung a burning fusee- at the cab
window

north america at that time he was
switch foreman for the indiana
harbor belt at gibson ind he says
 we coupled onto twelve cabooses
and hustled them from gibson to
ivanhoe tower over what was known
as the gary  western there we saw
the horrible wreck the  was still
upright her front end down looking
like a big crouching dog

    we joined in the rescue work
whenever we saw a clump of bushes
move or quiver we hurried there with
a stretcher i came across navarro he
was crying out piteously kill me
i want to die

    my crew and i hauled  of the
 injured to the hospital at ham-
mond

   the first tints of dawn were visible
 in the sky at the moment of the crash
 performers who escaped death stood

along the right-of-way in their night
clothing dazed and helpless as their
comrades were dying in the wreckage
manager dollmer who had escaped
unhurt after throwing his wife out of
the car to safety just before the col-
lision was working heroically to rescue
those pinioned in the debris

  survivors clawed into the wreck
searching hysterically for friends and
relatives only force prevented some
from rushing into the roaring furnace
of wreckage trainmaster whipple
was among the missing

  news of the disaster was slow in
getting out as the wreck tore down the
wires ed ballard of french lick
indiana owner of the show was in
gary when notified by telephone re-
lief trains with doctors nurses surgi-
cal supplies and fire engines were sent
from hammond gary east chicago
and other nearby localities but there
was a dearth of water supply when
finally water was brought in tank
wagons it was too late to do any good

  sadly the survivors were taken to
ilammond where they were to have
given a performance that day instead
of the gay holiday crowds expected
a weeping and bandaged- throng of
men and women performers gathered
silently around a red and gilt trimmed
ticket wagon on the hammond circus
grounds that afternoon seeking word
of the fate of their comrades

  from behind the bars of the window
of the ticket wagon manager dollmer
began the task of registering the sur-
vivors and compiling the grim casualty
list one by one the survivors filed
mournfully past the window

  joe coyle bandaged said   therell
be no circus in hammond tonight the
kids will get left this time then he
fainted and had to be carried away
on a stretcher

when the circus went west



michigan central engine no  sister of the  which plowed into the rear end of tha
haqenbeck-wallace circus special near chicago just before sunrise of june  

old-timers in the circus troupe
were recalling a similar catastro-
phe of the benjamin wallace shows
avhich later were merged into hagen-
beck-wallace at durand michigan
as one of the veterans put it

  two sections of the train collided
in the darkness on august th 
killing  persons and injuring many
more the first section arriving from
charlotte michigan was standing in
the grand trunk railway yards at
durand when the second section run-
ning at fifteen miles per hour crashed
into it

   engineer probst of battle creek
said he saw the red tail lights on the
first section and applied his air brakes
but to his horror they refused to
work then he reversed his engine
but the momentum of a -car train
was too great three cars of the first
section were telescoped the engine
and five cars of the second were de-
molished in the caboose of the first
section the members of the train crew
were sleeping the next two cars were
filled with circus performers also
asleep they never knew what hit
them until it was too late

   one of the cars was occupied by
    r

five elephants and several camels an
elephant and two camels were killed
outright but the other animals and
their trainers escaped as soon as they
recovered from the shock the trainers
rushed to the cages to quiet the excited
beasts which were trumpeting and
roaring with fear the escaping steam
and screams and cries made a terrify-
ing spectacle in the early morning a
nearby hotel was used as a hospital

   engineer probst fireman colter
and head brakeman benedict who
had been riding the engine of the sec-
ond section agreed that if the brakes
had been in working order the collision
could have been avoided colter and
benedict jumped to safety as soon as
they saw a collision was inevitable but
probst remained at the throttle until
within one hundred feet of the other
train then he too saved himself by
leaping

  the loss of life at ivanhoe was even
worse than the durand casualty list
l w landman michigan central
general passenger agent was unable to
explain what had caused the pile-up at
ivanhoe- unless he said  the en-
gineer of the troop train was dead at
the throttle


railroad stories

the elephants are coming section of old-time benjamin wallace circus parade one of
these elephants was killed in the  wreck at durand michigan

  rumors were afloat that a german
spy had drugged engineer sargent in
the hope of wrecking the troop train
which however happened to be empty

  on june th five days after the
accident an investigation was held at
hammond jointly by the bureau of
safety of the interstate commerce
commission and the indiana public
service commission to determine the
facts

engineer gasper of the cir-
cus train testified that looking
back he saw his flagman protect the
rear of his train with red and white
lanterns and saw him light a fusee
give a violent stop signal with it and
then throw the fusee into the air

  fireman phillips of the circus train
who had been hired only a few months

before admitted this was his first trip
so far west and said he was not familiar
with all the signals he did not know
anything about the accident until he
felt the crash then he looked back
and saw fire breaking out

  the conductor of the circus extra
r w johnson testified he had been
riding in the cupola with trainmaster
whipple as they approached ivanhoe
and noticed that all the signals were
working properly it was he who spied
the blazing hot box and signaled engi-
neer gasper to stop as they slowed
down the flagman dropped off taking
with him lanterns a fusee and tor-
pedoes while he conductor johnson
went forward to fix the hot box

  looking back johnson saw the glare
of the troop trains headlight round-
ing a curve and saw the flagman give
when the circus went west



a  washout  with the fusee and then
witnessed the crash

  the flagman timm told how he
had tried in vain to attract the atten-
tion of the engine crew on no 
but there was no indication that they
noticed him and the engine sped on
without slackening speed

  conductor l johnson of the troop
train said he met engineer sargent
just after the collision and asked how
it happened to which the engineer re-
plied   i was dozing otherwise
asleep brakeman jackson of the
troop train confirmed this testimony

  the fireman on no  gustave
ivlauss whose period of employment
dated from october  did not
testify at the hearing but stated

   i did not see the circus train
until we were nearly on top of it real-
izing that a collision could not be
avoided i grew dizzy and sick at the
stomach engineer sargent told me to
jump i crawled down from my seat
in the cab and that is the last thing i
remember until i found myself on a
train bound for my home in michigan
city my mind must have been a
blank when the collision came

  several of the men who testified at
the hearing said that fireman klauss
seemed to be wandering about the
scene in a daze

  both sargent and klauss were ar-
rested and tried for manslaughter
sargent had hired out with the michi-
gan central as a switch fireman in 
and had a good record up to january

	when he was discharged for run-

ning past a block signal in the stop
position and colliding with the rear of
a preceding train on december 

	he had been reinstated and his
record was clear until the ivanhoe
wreck in his report to the m c com-
pany officials he said he had had little
or no sleep since  am june  and
 had had a couple of heavy meals be-
fore going out realizing that i would
not get anything more to eat until some
time the next morning   

   the wind was blowing very hard
into cab on my side and i closed the
window which made the inside of cab
more comfortable before reaching
the next signal i dozed on account of
heat in cab and missed it not real-
izing what had happened to me until
within  or  feet i awoke suddenly
and saw the tail or marker lights show-
ing red on a train directly ahead of me
not realizing that the rear end of this
train was so close i started to make a
service application but before com-
pleting it placed brake-valve handle in-
to emergency position we struck al-
most instantly   

  at the trial the truth came out sar-
gent had taken kidney pills shortly be-
fore the collision and these as doc-
tors and chemists testified tended to
produce unavoidable drowsiness for
this reason he and klauss were exoner-
ated sargent went back to work run-
ning a switch engine at niles mich he
is now retired on pension

  gustave klauss never returned to
the iron trail the havoc wrought by
a box of pills was too much for him

         half century ago the
country was railroad
crazy almost anybody
who had a half-formed
scheme to construct a
line from almost any place to almost
any other place could find someone to
take him up on it whether or not
there was anything to haul didnt mat-
ter very much the theory was that the
railroad would develop the country-
that the rails must come first and the
business afterward sometimes it did
and sometimes it didnt

   the glamorous old carson  colo-

on the old carson  colorado



men had recently completed the famous
virginia  truckee which coined
money for its promoters and which
really was the inspiration for the new
narrow-gage carson  colorado
sharon and mills both saw a great
future for the road to look at the
map you cant blame them but how
successful the road was to be is quite
another story

  its northern terminus was mound
house nev on the virginia  truc-
kee and it was named for two rivers-
the carson near mound house and
the colorado down in southern ne-
vada but it never got to the colorado
when it reached keeler on owens
lake in southeastern california it
petered out

  its main line was  miles long and
its most populous station was haw-
thorne nev with less than five hun-
dred inhabitants at the peak of its pros-
perity there were some larger towns
in owens valley in california six
or eight miles from the road and the
projectors of the road thought those
towns would be forced to move over
and locate on the line but the people
of bishop big pine and independence
were a stubborn lot arid decided that if
the railway would not come to them
they would not go to the railway

  d	o mills who was the principal
stockholder didnt see the road until
after its completion in  then he
made a trip over the line in company
with h m yerington the general
manager mills took in the surround-
ings in grim silence going and return-
ing but all the while vouchsafed no

    o 

word finally yerington plucked up
courage enough to ask mills opinion
of the venture

   it is either three hundred miles too
long replied d o  or it was built

 see dec  railroad stories

about three hundred years too soon

  in addition to a number of paiute
and digger indians and chinese coo-
lies keeler had a white population of
about thirty mound house was not
quite so big from it trains ran south
one hundred miles to hawthorne
where the locomotive was placed in a
roundhouse and the train hands and
passengers ate supper and went to bed
there was nothing else to do in haw-
thorne

  when jim butler the discoverer of
the famed mining camp of tonopah
made his first trip over the line he was
asked the inevitable  what do you
think of the carson  colorado rail-
road

  jim scratched his head squirted half
a pint of tobacco juice at a crack in the
station platform and drawled
 wa-al its the fust railroad i ever
see that began nowhar ended nowhar
an stopped all night to think it over

  of course when construction of the
line began there were a number of
prosperous mining camps like bodie
benton and candelaria contributing to
its revenue but then the fall in the
price of the white metal began the
consequent decline of the mining camps
was a hard blow to the road

during the early s the con-
ductor not only had to handle
the train but to do the station work at
the four stations between belleville and
keeler  miles conductor frank

d	cagwin was something of a telegra-
pher and reported his train at summit
and other stations conductor harry

e	epstine worrying about his job
saw that it might be wise for him to do
the same and soon was able to  plug 
as well as anyone

 man the engine is no  american type built by baldwin

way considered himself lucky when
the road was breaking even general
manager yerington got the idea of cut-
ting the trainmens wages but laws
would not stand for it rather than
do so he cut himself from  to
 a month this may sound phony
but laws was like that

  once when brakemen were scarce
alex wittman was taking a trainload
of cattle from laws to hawthorne-
eight cars of cattle no air brakes and
no brakeman at junction where the
train pulled off the main line alex
busy letting the cars down with hand
brakes got an indian from among a
lot of redskins that were riding on top
of the cars-indians always rode free
on the carson  colorado-to throw
the switch the paiute buck did not
relish the job which meant that he

would have to run a little distance to
overtake the train the thought
weighed so heavily on his mind that
he threw the switch before the last car
had passed and thus turned over six
carloads of cattle

   i was behind the cattle train with
the regular train records former con-
ductor epstine  and i surely found
a mess but fortunately nobody was
seriously injured i sent aleck on to
hawthorne with the two carloads of
cattle that had remained upright got
some cowboys from candelaria to herd
the rest of the cattle into the corral at
belleville and pulled the overturned
cars off the main line with my engine
and tackle it took a couple hours

  a couple hours didnt mean anything
on the carson  colorado

  there were many wrecks but only
on the old carson  colorado



two deaths and those among the train-
men main-line meets would occur
although always there was ample time
to stop and nearly all such accidents
were covered up

   after the southern pacific took
over the line relates epstine  the
new book of rules confused the minds
of some of the old hands one day
when the train manned by conductor
george woodruff and engineer gobey
should have waited on a sidetrack they
misinterpreted the rules and continued
on the main track my train west-
bound met them six miles out of rio
vista they refused to back up their
train to mason and i stood my ground
finally they yielded and did back up
but upon their arrival at hawthorne
they reported that they had met me on
the main line where i had no business
to be and that i refused to back up
being in the wrong they lost their
jobs but after a month or so superin-
tendent laws relented and took them
back again

during the os the trainmen
were all informally dressed but
when i first passed over the line in
 the conductors wore caps with
gold braid and blue frock coats with
plenty of brass buttons

business was still very poor

we often pulled out of
mound house without a
passenger in either of the
two canary-colored passen-
ger coaches which with the
mail and express car-also a
bright yellow-made up the train

  the conductor and brakeman liked
to have one passenger at least for then
with the railway mail clerk as a fourth
hand they could play whist during the
seven-hour run to hawthorne even
the engineer used to turn his cab over

to the fireman now and then and take
a hand at the game the headquarters
of general manager yerington were
at carson which was entirely off the
line and this gave the train hands con-
siderable leeway

  the only passenger north from
hawthorne one day was mrs jack
campbell wife of the editor of the
walker lake bulletin a hawthorne
weekly just after the train had slipped
over the first rise that hid it from
hawthorne it came to a stop and re-
mained there so long that mrs camp-
bell became annoyed and curious she
finally investigated walking the length
of the train she could find no sign of
the crew even the locomotive was
deserted so she climbed a hill that
would give her a view of walker lake
and there she saw the missing crew-
conductor brakeman engineer and
fireman-in swimming in the next
issue of her husbands newspaper the
incident made quite an item

  this stirred yerington to red-hot
wrath-not so much because of the
liberty taken by the trainmen as be-
cause of the damage to the dignity of
the road for the story was widely
copied in the nevada press he at
once issued a bulletin announcing that
the next train hand who
went swimming during his
run would do so at the peril
of his job

  the eyes of superintend-
ent laws twinkled as he ad-
vised conductor epstine of
the new rule epstines crew
had been caught by mrs campbell al-
though every crew on the run had been
doing the same thing epstine re-
marked at the time that laws himself
would have enjoyed a swim with the
boys

  from him the conductors had


railroad stories

orders for a time to pick up and carry-
on to his destination any man seen
packing his blankets beside the road
this order did not last long for tricky
rogues who were able to pay their fare
used to outfit themselves with a blanket
pack and impose on the generosity of
the management their hoggishness
resulted in the loss of free rides to
many a poor devil who deserved a lift

  one morning the only passengers out
of mound house were a woman and
her two children approaching wa-
buska the midway eating station
conductor a y gale told her it would
be her only chance to eat before haw-
thorne she answered that she thought
she and the kids could stick it out until
five oclock gale and the other train
hands ate and as the train pulled out

judging by this photo made in  at keeler the cc railroad boys stayed away from
the saloon as far as they could even when having their pictures taken the saloon is at
the extreme right whereas the railroaders are standing on the left with frank cagwin

the engineer beside a tree

  stations meant nothing in particular
on the carson  colorado the train
would stop at any place on the main
line to load or unload freight or
passengers prospectors far away in
the hills would leave their empty
barrels alongside the track and the
train crew would refill them with
water they would unload freight at
any place a prospector desired even by
the carload providing the prospector
would furnish men to unload it

gale boarded the smoker to enjoy a
cigar strolling into the passenger
coach half an hour later he was amazed
to find it vacant he rushed up to the
mail car -where the brakeman was
playing seven-up with the postal clerk

   say yelled gale  what became
of that woman with the two kids

  the brakeman did not know for not
having visited the passenger coach
since leaving wabuska he had not
missed her but the mail clerk who
on the old carson  colorado



another view of no  the ccs little wood-burning eight-wheeler in front of the lake-
view hotel at keeler nearly fifty years ago

had come late from lunch said he had
seen her entering the dining room just
as he left it which was immediately
before the parting whistle blew

   consarn it all ejaculated gale
who was called  deacon  because of
the mildness of his profanity  well
have to back up five miles to get her
and that is exactly what they did
for individual service the carson 
colorado was unbeatable

during nearly all the os the
major revenue of the road came
from shipments of soda and borax
which were taken from owens lake
when the road was completed to
keeler quite a borax industry sprang
up there the lake water incidentally
was hard on insects and countless
myriads of them lost their lives in its
waves so immense was the number
that on some hot summer nights the
stench from the lake smote passengers
nostrils five miles out of keeler

  when the insects werent so bad the

townspeople used to hold bathing
parties on moonlight nights their
bathing suits were nightshirts weighted
down with pieces of lead sewed into
the bottom hems of the garments two
keeler ladies once invited two newly
arrived railroad men to join them in
a moonlight swim the railroaders
asked about bathing suits and were told
that nightshirts would do but the
ladies forgot to tell them about the
necessity for weights so the boys went
into the lake without the weights and
the bathing party broke up in a hurry

  because of the chemicals which are
responsible for this buoyancy the
waters of the lake are excellent for
bathing it is said they will cleanse a
man of everything but original sin in
keeler they used to tell of a miner
from the panamints who came to town
with the accumulation of years of
grime upon his person he wanted to
bathe but after looking at the lake and
smelling the water he decided to get
drunk first then he forgot to take


railroad stories

his clothes off before going in he
simply lay down with his body in the
water and his head on the shore and
fell asleep when he awoke the next
morning he found that the water had
not only dissolved his clothing but had
removed a three-years accumulation of
whiskers

  i do know for a fact that robert
rauhut a virginia city nev barber
once got into trouble with his custom-
ers by using owens lake water for a
shampoo he had been induced by a
thrifty railway mail clerk from the
carson  colorado line to invest in a
five-gallon demijohn of what he ever
afterward referred to as  keeler
water and used it on his patrons with
striking results first their hair turned
to a chemical blonde then it became
shaggy straight and choppy then it
stuck up and out like lightning rods
and finally it fell out leaving the vic-
tims bald from that time on mention
of  keeler water  in his presence
would stir him to tears of rage

  in  the carson  colorado was
sold to the southern pacific-a most
unfortunate deal for the sellers the
road had hardly passed out of their
hands when the tonopah mines began
to ship ore and thousands of adven-
turers rushed into southern nevada
in one year the southern pacific took
in more than the  it had paid
for the pike

  then followed the discovery and set-
tlement of goldfield twenty-eight
miles from tonopah and the revenues
of the road were enormously increased
other newly settled camps like rhyo-
lite and manhattan swelled the profits
of the road

  the loss of the carson  colorado
business in itself was not the only one
sustained by the original owners they
still held the virginia  truckee and

that up to the sale of the carson 
colorado had always enjoyed its share
of the northbound traffic for it was
the connecting link with the southern
pacific at reno and the bulk of the
freight and passenger traffic went
through that place to and from san
francisco

  but the southern pacific had no
sooner acquired control of the carson
 colorado when it constructed a cut-
off which took all that away from the
virginia  truckee the cutoff ran
from churchill to hazen which left
mound house and dayton high and
dry and the s p has recently aban-
doned the line from churchill to
mound house lock stock and barrel

  and that isnt all the southern
pacific has asked the interstate com-
merce commissions permission to
abandon the -mile stretch from
mina nev to laws calif accord-
ing to the latest timetable a train is
run between these points only once a
week-from mina to keeler on tues-
day and return on wednesday by the
time this sees print it may be pulled off

  not many of the old-timers who
used to run on the carson  colorado
survive harry e epstine who served
on the line for twenty years and then
became a stock broker first in tonopah
and then in san francisco in which
city he has been for several terms
president of the san francisco stock
exchange and frank cagwin who
was first an engineer and then a con-
ductor are the only survivors of whom
i know cagwin a railroader by in-
stinct as well as occupation though
now retired is spending the remaining
years of his life at the railroad town
of sparks nevada wliere he can hear
the whistles toot and smell the engines
and where he can be closer to the actual
country of the old carson  colorado
americas only railroad station chapel

in old russia before the
soviet practically every
railroad station contained an
altar where the pious peasants
would invoke divine blessing
upon their journey and even
upon the baggage they carried

this custom was not carried
over into the new world until
just a few months ago and
even then in very modified
form when the pennsylvania
railroad erected its huge new
station at thirtieth and market
streets philadelphia it set
aside a beautiful suite of rooms
to be used as a chapel on the
second floor ol the great struc-
ture

this is said to be the only
chapel that is part of a railroad
station in north america cer-
tainly it is the only one in the
united states and there is none
in canada that we know of

originally it was intended to
be used for funeral parties
traveling by rail as a sanctuary
for the casket and the mourn-
ers set apart from the swirl
of traffic as yet no official
name has been given to this
suite although unofficially it is
known as a chapel funeral	courtesy of railway age  church st n  city

parlor mortuary chamber or

retiring room for wedding oouples or others desiring privacy and peace

    elisha lee late vice president of the pennsylvania conceived this idea and died
shortly after seeing it carried into effect while seated in the chapel of an ocean liner
he was so impressed by his surroundings that he decided to adapt them to another form
of transportation the railroad his first thought was to have a chapel aboard the
limited trains as a modernization of the old custom of carrying a small church organ
for sunday services on the early transcontinental trains but this was found to be
impracticable

    mr lee planned the station chapel in consultation with his son-in-law greville
a g haslam headmaster of episcopal academy philadelphia also various clergy-
men the station architects robert farnum chief engineer and george gibbs artist

    a suggestion was made that the chapel be hung with fine old tapestries portraying
religious subjects but this idea was discarded because no religious subjects could be
found that would be equally satisfactory to catholics protestants and jews to say
nothing of those who professed other beliefs or were freethinkers finally a series of
eight mural panels was decided upon symbolizing the beauties of nature with only one
spiritualized human figure that of a woman meditating the artist intended her to
be a cross between jhe madonna and mona lisa her head and shoulders are draped
with a shawl her feet are bare she is seated alone at twilight

    the room is isolated no-sound penetrates its cloistered seclusion it is furnished
with comfortable but dignified armchairs and davenports with a thick green rug on
the floor and glass ceiling all illuminated with soft blue and white reflected lights
the main chamber is twenty by forty feet there are also retiring rooms a large
lobby and a small marble crypt for the coffin if any-h r edwards

of -- types constructed for that road they were being used at the time of the

wreck of 

seventy-eight years ago

 by william s lee

  who died long ago this true tale is based on his testimony at the investigation

	n the day of the accident

thursday july   i
was engineer on the down
train southbound i was
not a regular engineer den-
tistry being my profession but i had been
in the employ of the north pennsylvania
railroad company now the reading for
about a year and i knew how to run an
engine

  my engine was the  aramingo there
was no clock at the upper end of the road
gwynned now gwynned valley station

twenty miles out of the present reading
terminal philadelphia so we had no way
of regulating our watches except in the city

 our conductor william vanstavoren
known as  van seemed bright and cheer-
ful on the morning of the th i dont
suppose he had any premonition that this
was to be his last day of life

  we left gwynned with a mixed train at

	am by vans watch van had come up
from philadelphia the previous night i
am not aware if he had regulated his watch
in the city that night but it was his habit

the  wyoming no  of the north pennsylvania r r was constructed by baldwin the
year after the wreck at ambler she had  x -inch cylinders -inch drivers weighed



to do so as the company had printed rules
to that effect framed and hung up in the
engine cabs

  we had a baggage car a passenger coach
and a freight we knew there would be
an excursion coming up from philadelphia
on our single-tracked railroad and we had
instructions to watch out for it

  the excursion as i learned later was a
sunday-school picnic from st michaels
r c church philadelphia there were
about twelve hundred passengers mostly
children excited and happy but still a bit
sleepy at having been awakened so early
they looked forward to spending a hot mid-
summer day in the country the spot se-
lected was schaefs woods in the white-
marsh valley near fort washington six-
teen miles from the present reading ter-
minal many carried huge baskets full of
lunch while the sunday-school manage-
ment took along ice cream for every-
body

  the train was to run in two sections
each carrying six hundred persons a h
fracker master of transportation for the
north pennsylvania railroad issued these
running orders

 this church was ioo years old oct  

    excursion no -leave master st
  at  am and run to fort washington
  with a clear track by  am returning
  follow flag of  pm train from fort
  washington and arrive at master st
  at  pm

    excursion no -leave master st
  at  am and follow flag of regular
  train from fort washington the en-
  gine will follow the same train to
  gwynned turn and follow back to fort
  washington returning leave fort
  washington at  pm and run with
  clear track to master st by  pm

    the train carrying flag for excursion
  will keep main track at passing places
  extra precaution must be taken by con-
  ductors and engineers carrying or fol-
  lowing a flag to prevent collision op-
  posing train will wait  minutes 
  flag for excursion trains then proceed
  at usual speed keeping  minutes be-
  hind should excursion train get more
  than  minutes behind it must be kept
  out of the way of regular trains

  these orders were not carried out fail-
ure to obey the last sentence set a new
high mark in railroad casualties

  so many eager picnickers tried to climb
aboard the first section on the fatal morn-
ing of july th that it was delayed until
 when the train finally pulled out
of the dingy little station it was overcrowd-


railroad stories

  ed with seven hundred passengers instead
of six hundred

  the first section consisted of one loco-
motive ten passenger coaches and one
freight car the freight carried the lunch
baskets ice cream hammocks swings and
equipment for outdoor sports

  a jinx hung over the crew henry har-
rison the engineer was riding to death
fireman john butcher was going to be in-
jured and conductor alfred f hoppel dis-
graced only the two brakemen lewis
page and sanford m cornell would return
unhurt and with clean records

while excursion no i with eleven
cars was heading northward on the
single-track road our three-car mixed local
was proceeding southward to meet it we
had four miles to go on a down grade to
make fort washington at wissahickon-
the station just before fort washington-
i said to my fireman

   i wonder if the excursion has arrived
we both thought the excursion had al-
ready reached our meeting place and was
waiting on a sidetrack-or  sideling as
we called it then i had seen smoke rising
around the hill at fort washington the
excursion was due there at  am we were
due at  but were a few minutes late

  in those days it was customary for a
southbound train to wait at fort washing-
ton fifteen minutes if necessary for an
excursion train then if it did not come
the southbound engineer was to proceed
slowly and send a man ahead on horseback
to warn the excursion that the down train
was on its way this we failed to do

  i asked conductor vanstavoren  is it
time for us to leave the wissahickon sta-
tion

   yes he said  go on

  but my fireman warned  go slow
around that curve the excursion may be
standing on the main track

  yes that was possible i did not want
to take unnecessary chances at fort
washington we waited two minutes with-
out seeing the excursion while van took
on passengers and cans of milk for the city

it was then  i asked him for orders

   go ahead said van

   very good i answered  but you had
better not there may be an accident

  van was impatient to get going we
were already late  blow your whistle and
run slow he ordered

  as we rounded another curve i blew the
whistle so loudly that i could not have
heard the whistle of the approaching ex-
cursion i shut off steam and let the train
coast on its own impetus then i put on
steam again to reach the next station
deweys lane now called fellwick

  we were then making ten miles an hour
suddenly i saw the shadow of the other
trains smoke on a curving embankment

  reversing the aramingo i whistled for
down brakes our speed was reduced
to about two miles an hour but a collision
was inevitable my fireman and i leaped
out of the cab just before the two iron
monsters came together

  fascinated with terror i watched the
crash each engine weighed about 
pounds first the excursion engine climbed
over mine with a din that could be heard
for miles then the impact swung them
around the bottoms of both coming to-
gether finally the aramingo rolled over
to one side and her boiler exploded

five cars of the excursion were shat-
tered to kindling wood it was a scene
of indescribable horror i found john ed-
wards our baggagemaster lying on the
ground he had broken a leg in jumping

i	carried him to a safe distance then i
assisted a man who had lost one leg and
had the other broken i rendered first aid
but i dont think he lived long

  van was working nobly to assist the in-
jured there was a strained and tragic
look in his eyes he told me he was con-
templating suicide

  john butcher fireman on the excursion
had been thtown thirty feet into a field
but was not seriously injured his engi-
neer henry harrison trying to jump had
fallen between his engine and tender and
met death instantly

gesture was futile five excursion coaches
were burned so completely that nothing
was left except wheels and axles in a
tangled mass of charred debris

 about nine oclock nearly three hours
after the collision the congress engine 

hose company of chestnut hill a neigh-
boring community came dashing up the
horses were in a foam from fast running
but they arrived too late to do any good
at the same time four doctors arrived

  the heroine of this disaster was mrs
mary benjamin ambler widow of andrew
ambler who had built a fulling mill at
wissahickon some years before as soon
as she learned of the wreck mrs ambler
ran over to the scene with lint bandages
and other surgical supplies all day under
the broiling sun she cared for those who
desperately needed help without stopping
herself to eat or drink


railroad stories

  dying men looked up into her eyes and
called her  angel injured children were
soothed by the gentle touch of her hand
under mary amblers direction stretchers
were made from house shutters and the
victims were taken to her house and the
mill there she nursed them until they
were able to be moved to their own homes

  in all sixty-six persons were killed and
at least a hundred seriously hurt it was
at that time americas worst rail disaster
one of those who met death was the rev
daniel sheridan rector of st michaels
church a watch found on his body was
stopped at  the moment of the crash

even before the bodies were removed
coroner delevau of montgomery
county summoned me to an inquest also
conductor alfred f hoppel the brakeman
of the excursion and other witnesses i
told what i knew about the collision after
which mr hoppel said

   the excursion left master street at
 am every few miles we had to stop
on account of the track being wet with
dew when we reached tacony grade we
were detained six or eight minutes by slip-
pery tracks and insufficient head of steam

   at this place i got on the engine and
told engineer harrison we could make
deweys lane after that i would see if we
had sufficient steam to reach fort wash-
ington we proceeded until we saw the
down train approaching then mr har-

rison reversed his engine and jumped i
jumped also my watch said 
conductor hoppel admitted the excur-
sion train was more than fifteen minutes
late  the time for the regular train to
leave the station at fort washington is ten
minutes after timetable time he said
 from my understanding of the instruc-
tions i supposed that in consequence of
our non-arrival the down train would leave
fort washington at  otherwise i
would not have run on

  the coroner censured hoppel for not
waiting on the sidetrack and for speeding
recklessly around a dangerous curve  at
the moment of the collision mr delevau
pointed out  the regular train had nearly
stopped while the excursion was still mov-
ing at the rate of thirty miles an hour
he exonerated van and me but it was
too late to clear van the poor fellows
mind had been unhinged by the tragedy
after working heroically to save as many
passengers as he could conductor van-
stavoren had taken his own life may he
rest in peace

  mary ambler died in  three years
after the civil war and twelve years after
the collision in which her noble efforts had
won commendation from railroad officials
and a few months later the ambler mill
was destroyed by fire thereupon the rail-
road company honored her memory by
changing the name of wissahickon station
to ambler and ambler it still is

href days and three nights
in a box car through
france that was sumpn

   back in november 
our regiment had arrived
from america at the french port of
brest after being forced to stay on

board ship for five days until trains
could be obtained to take us to our
training area we were taken ashore
one morning by lighters and marched
to the railroad yards where most of
us had our first view of a french train

torty to a car
we climbed
aboard

were funny the french name for a
freight car is  wagon and that about
describes it in english

  on the side of each door was lettered
 hotnmes- chevaux which meant
the car was to hold not more than forty
men or eight horses we were divided
into lots of forty to a car and told to
climb aboard

  there were removable benches down
the center and sides of each car for
the  hommes to get what comfort
they could in case the  chevaux
were passengers the benches were
thrown out and straw spread on the
floor we learned later on from the
experience of this trip that the horses
had the right idea after that trip we
too spread straw and by a lot of care-
ful planning all of us could actually
lie down on the floor at once

  the fact that horses had been the

    	r

most recent occupants of our car was
very much in evidence to put it deli-
cately it was very objectionable at first

  these extensive preparations gave
us the first inkling of the length of our
journey no one seemed to know just
where we were headed rumors were
plentiful one of them sounded good
to us it was that we were going to
be paraded in paris just to be shown
off to the french people but actually
i was in france almost a year before
i saw paris

  finally our train was all set to move
tzve-e-t tzve-e-e-t came from the en-
gine whistle this caused another
general laugh it sounded like a pea-
nut whistle which had gone haywire

  there was much shouting back and
forth between the people and ourselves
as we passed through the small villages
and towns we with our  vive la

france  and they with  vive iamcri-
que  when they realized who we were
then one of our wits conceived the
idea of yelling unprintable words to
all the french he saw and they think-
ing it some form of
american greeting
wrould reply with the
same word as nearly
as they could pro-
nounce it

our train was
continually being
shoved into sidings to
clear the way for
faster ones it seems
we were not supposed
to interfere with the
regular passenger
freight or french
troop trains we
never knew how long
these stops were to be
-sometimes for only
a few moments and
then again for hours
at a time usually the
stops were most wel-
come

  france was then having its annual
rainy spell for which it is well-known
the weather was raw and very cold
and as that first night drew on we won-
dered about sleep with all passen-
gers jammed into such close quarters
the air was considerably less than
fresh the upper part of the car sides
were hinged and could be dropped but
not in that cold weather so the side
doors which were of sliding type were
opened a trifle even though there wfas
complaining from the men nearby

  with not enough room for anyone
to lie down it was impossible to un-
roll packs to get out blankets the only
way to get any sleep was to sit back

to back on the low benches and doze

  sometime early in the morning we
were awakened by a loud banging on
the side of the car the train was at
a stop near a large french cantonment
and here were each
served with a huge
cup of alleged coffee
which tasted mighty
peculiar later we
learned it contained
about half cognac it
warmed us up nicely

  that next day was
pretty much a repeti-
tion of the first ex-
ept that the weather
was getting milder
this fact started
fresh rumors as to
our destination one
was that we were
going right on
through france and
were to do our train-
ing with the italians
instead of the french
even our officers had
no idea where wre
were headed

  twice during the day our engine
started from sidings with only a part
of the train in tow one of our bright
buck privates had  pulled the pin 
somewhere along the string of cars
he thought it would be a good joke
on the train crew but they couldnt
take a joke for they stormed loudly

  the major of our battalion was told
about it next time it happened he
called our attention to the seriousness
of the offense and pointed out that
these delays might cause the section
following to crash into our rear his
threatened courtmartial to any man
caught tampering with the train had
the desired effect

  by thethird day many of our men
were among the missing they just
got left behind for they couldnt make
it back to the train before it pulled out
of a siding  some were picked up by
the several sections following and a
few did not show up for weeks

  the third night we all slept like logs
from sheer exhaustion morning found
our train at its destination-a little

railroad town named void near this
point we were to go into training for
trench warfare we could hear the
steady rumble of the big guns front
line trenches were only  miles away

train and the distance in a straight

working as a conductor he was load-
ing a train of cattle when about a dozen
cowboys decided to give him a good
shellacking they fought around the
train chuck wagon and stock pens but
big john finally knocked them all cold
another time a coach load of roose-
velts rough riders tried to beat him
up but he the brakeman and an army
officer got the bad boys quieted down

  there were two rules in the book
that he wouldnt stand to see violated
and these were rules g and h he
hated anyone who drank or smoked
cigarettes i have seen him knock ciga-
rettes out of jellybean employees
mouths and run drunken switchmen
clean out of the yard limits

  once i was deadheading in a ca-
boose the conductor was sitting at
his desk making out a wheel report
smoking a cigarette when big john
headed into the crummy the skipper
swallowed the cigarette fire and all
and never batted an eye

  	rule g the use of intoxicants or narcotics
is prohibited

 rule h the use of tobacco by employees
while on duty in or about passenger stations or
on passenger cars is prohibited

 wsfoil i skrt

 photo from joseph lavelle
 a low-wheeled tough little -- built years ago by baldwin for the l-gn

  in  i was firing the third shift
 the austin pusher engine for a lazy
sleepy-headed engineer a hot shot
freight train came along about three
am we backed the helper engine onto
the caboose and started rooting him
up the colorado river mountain

  my hoghead hooked the reverse
lever almost up in the center of the
quadrant he gave her about half a
throttle put his feet on top of the auto-
matic brake valve pulled his cap down
over his eyes leaned back on the back
rest and said to me

   heres where i get my undisturbed
rest wake me up when we get on
top of the mountain

we had only gone a short distance
when the drivers of the big
freight engine on the head end began
to slip because of a heavy dew and a
heavy train our engine wasnt getting
enough steam to turn her wheels and
my little boy blue hoghead couldnt
even hear the other engineer blow
his horn for more help because he was
in the hay fast asleep

  we were on short time to make vin-
son a siding on top of the mountain
for a passenger extra with rights
over us i had just put a plaster of
about a dozen scoops of coal in the
firebox when i saw someone climbing

over the coal gates it was big john
he walked right between me and the
hoghead so i couldnt wake the man up

  john didnt say a word he took a
look at me the water glass steam gage
and saw that everything was percolat-
ing all right he next cast his eyes at
the hoghead then he took him by
the arm and gave him a few shakes
but the engineer would not rouse-he
thought i was fooling with him so
he just turned over and went on snor-
ing in a big way

  big john put his right hand under
the engineers shoulders his left under
his knees picked him up like a bab
and threw him down in the deck as
hard as he could

  then big john climbed on the seat-
box and sat down he put the john-
son bar down in the last notch
snatched the boiler handle wide open
and switched on the sander valve
clinkers as big as beer kegs started
dancing a jig inside the firebox

  by this time the hoghead had just
begun to realize what was taking place
i thought he was going to do a nose
dive into the colorado canyon when
big john turned to me and said

   youd better keep this engine hot
or ill throw you over the right-o-way
fence

  i reached for the scoop and started
true tales of the rails



baling coal big john looked at the
dethroned hoghead and started spilling
good advice

   im getting tired of these freight
trains dragging you sleepy hogheads
up this mountain coupled on to a ca-
boose and masquerading as a helper
engine from now on youre going
to help or theres gonna be some new
faces on this job

  the hoghead grabbed the coal pick
scaled over the coal gates and started
digging down arkansas smokeless
slack and i was burning it as fast as
he could rake it down

  on arriving at the top of the moun-
tain before the brakeman cut off the
helper engine john went to the ca-
boose we never heard another word
from him about the dreadful night al-
though the engineer thought he was
canned

even at the worst john was good-
hearted i have seen him dis-
charge employees keep them off a week
or so and put them back and pay them
for what time theyd lost before the
griever would have time to take up the
case with him

  big john always liked me because i
didnt use tobacco and he would give
me almost anything i wanted the
orneriest boomer switchman i ever
knew got canned out of the san an-
tonio yard he was so useless the
b r t griever refused to handle his
case this boomer came to me and
asked me to get john to reinstate him

  so i walked into his office unan-
nounced pulled off my hat and sat
down as soon as he got through read-
ing a letter he asked what i had on my
mind i told him he pounded his
desk with his fist till he shook the whole
passenger station and then said

   i thought youd have more respect

for me than to come here and ask me
to reinstate that punk if youll just
show me one good thing this man ever
done ill put him back to work

  i stood up cleared my throat walked
near the door and said  he doesnt
smoke cigarettes

  big john scratched his head pulled
off his glasses and laid them on his
desk i was afraid he was going to
take after me but he said

   ill give him one more trial but
if he doesnt tend to business better
than before im going down in the
yard and run him out of town myself
i had not told a lie this boomer
didnt smoke cigarettes but he would
smoke opium mariahuana drink
canned heat or beat a board bill he
worked a couple of days so he could
get a service letter and then resigned

  john spent his declining years on a
farm in missouri visiting the san an-
tonio division every few years the
last time i saw him was in taylor
yard he asked about all the old-
timers and wanted to know how his
successor a b kelly ran the division
and insisted that i tell him for its
human nature for a rail to want to
know if the fellow who took his place
is doing as well as he did

   mr kelly is a good man and a
good superintendent i told him if
you will tote fair with him he will tote
fair with you but he has one draw-
back

  big john wanted to know right now
what the drawback was he almost
had tears in his eyes while i was talk-
ing so i up and informed him that
a b kelly smoked cigarettes

  john looked up the track turned
around and looked down the track he
pulled off his big broad-brimmed hat
scratched his head and said

   yes and so do some ladies
the boomers corner

n  i landed a job as brakeman
out of springfield mo on the old
kansas city fort scott  memphis
and worked  days as student with-
out pay i well remember the first
trip i made for pay i rode out on
top all the way from springfield to
thayer  miles brakemen were required to
be on top while approaching stations also while
ascending and descending all grades but as there
were never more than  or  cars with air brakes
and sometimes none we had to be out regardless
of weather

  very few cars had air and only about half the
cars were equipped with the old jenny coup-
lers i was lucky never to get a hand pinched or
lose a finger front ends of engines were equipped
with the old pilot bars when coupling into cars
a brakeman had to hold this bar up i judge it
weighed about  lbs and there were  strips on
the pilot each about  inches wide to stand on
while making the coupling

  one night we were coming west out of thayer
i was head brakeman and had  cars to set out
in mountain grove where a  split derailer  was
supposed to stand for the crossover someone had
left it wrong i backed the cars and engine
through the thing cut the cars off and gave the
engineer a signal to go ahead since there was
no light on the switch the engineer had not no-
ticed it was wrong he started through we
turned the engine over blocking the main line
about  hours i figured that was the end of
my railroading but got off with   brownies
not long after that coming up koshkonong hill
one dark night we discovered a light ahead of
us it looked like someone waving a chunk of
fire as we were running slow all that was neces-
sary to stop the train was to shut off the engine
the engineer told me

   go out and see what that old farmer wants
i suppose some of his cows are on the track

  it was much worse than that an old wooden
bridge was burned out a short distance ahead
just around the curve but for the farmers warn-
ing we would have gone into it

  i left the k c f
s  m shortly after
the frisco took it over
then i became a boom-
er i worked a few
days for the m k
 t from denison
tex to sapulpa
okla then for the
rock island and the
mo p in  promoted to conductor in 

  in  my brother e s dellinger wanted to
get a job braking i did not want him to go on
the road i was afraid he might get killed and i
knew dad would blame me if anything happened
but i took e s on the caboose to osawatomie
kan and we went into the office of trainmaster
summers mo p i asked summers if he could

give the kid a job summers asked  vvhats he
been doing i said teaching school

  summers said  he looks more like a school-
boy than a teacher he couldnt set a brake light
as he is but ill give him a job if youll vouch for
him being twenty-one now bill you take this
kid out with you teach him not to be afraid of
engines and cars then well put him on local

  e s was braking for me once on what we
called the swing job we came out of k c on
a merchandise run and had one car to set out at
paola kan we were going over the train head-
ing down into paola she was running pretty
fast and i was ahead of e s as i went to step
from one car to the other i missed my step and
fell between the cars but i caught the brake
wheel as i went down when i got back up on
the car my brother was so scared he could not
talk for a moment finally he said  my god
bill how did you ever get back on top

 thats nothing i
said  youll soon get
used to little things like
that but he didnt think
so one morning he said

 bill ive quit the job

i asked what was wrong

he said  the end of a
running board broke with
me and i just about went
under such an accident wont happen to me
but once my brother went back home farmed
taught school and worked in a store but he
liked the iron road and when father died he went
to springfield and got a job braking on the frisco
after a year and a half of it with dwindling pros-
pects of holding a job he went back to teaching

  for the third and last time he came to kansas
city and got a job as brakeman on the frisco
where my  sons and i were working he worked
about  months and then returned to teaching
school and from that to story writing to which
i think he is much better adapted

after working for a lot of
roads i finally landed on the
frisco again i have been work-
ing for them out of k c for 
years in train service have seen many changes
and improvements when i first took up rail-
roading the largest cars we had were  lbs
capacity today we have them over  in
the early days we handled  to  cars in a train
recently i have handled as many as  other
roads handle many more than that

  when i started on the road wrecks were so
numerous that the wrecker was kept steamed up
and ready to go at all times now its different
we have not had a wreck on the friscos northern
div where i work for as long as i can remem-
ber and we make a speed of  miles an hour
with our freight trains we dont need any
wrecker i think wrecks are just as rare on other
roads also-wm f dellinger  summit st

summertime snow

        rumbling roar was
followed by a shower of
cinders and a cloud of
smoke as the  golden
gate limited  thun-
dered by the little switch shanty the
old boomer who was waiting for a
westbound freight looked up as
 humpy  cain turned to him with
a smile

 that was tommy brannigan
comes into town like hell in a whirl-
wind and goes out the same way give

him an engine big enough and hed
outrun the devil himsdf old  dare-
devil  dolan used to throw a mean
wheel but he never had nothing on
his son-in-law

   i remember dolan nodded the
old boomer  whatever became of
him

   he was pensioned about two years
ago humpy replied

it was a strange problem
that mary dolan brought
to enginemen on the
siwash division

railroad stories

 you dont tell me the old
boomer looked surprised  i thought
they were going to fire him when i
left here dolan was nuttier than a pet
coon

 not dolan humpy sniffed
 youve got your wires twisted if
daredevil dolan was nutty then ive
been overdue at the asylum for ten
years

   well he was the old boomer in-
sisted  seems like hed killed a little
gypsy girl in peters pass and the
mamma of the kid puts a curse on the
old man saying he would die in the
pass when snow fell in the summer-
time from then on the old hogger
was so busy looking for spooks and
the snow he couldnt make the time on
the limited they put him on a slower
run but no use on top of that the
firemen got to refusing to fire for him
they was talking about firing him
when i got canned i often wondered
what happened to him evidently he
must have beat the curse some way

   dolan could beat a dozen curses
spoke up  knowitall  bonner sage
of the switch shanty  but it was
brannigan who saw the snow in the
pass that summer night not dolan
only for dolan they would both have
been killed

   so the gypsys curse did come
true exclaimed the old boomer

   that knowitall smiled  is what
makes the story

   shoot begged the old boomer
and knowitall always willing to
spin a yarn obliged

it was dolan who made the trial
run with the fast mail that run
landed the contract for the t k  p
and set a record for speed which the
rival roads shot at for years in vain
however dolans reputation was

made long before that the nickname
he got after the dearville flood

  and a daredevil he was in those
days-a daredevil who handled his en-
gine as a jockey does his mount with
a black cap perched rakishly over his
right ear a smile on his map of ire-
land face and an old corncob pipe
turned upside down in his mouth
when section gangs heard him whistle
they took to the fields for safety and
section foremen swore it took the rest
of the day to put the ballast back on
the tracks after dolan had passed by

  but they admired him and loved
him on the old siwash division a
speedy runner and a safe one never
a wreck or a derailment dolan broke
records as easily as mary his blue-
eyed black-haired daughter broke
hearts half the young fellows in the
town were in love with her and want-
ing to marry her tommy brannigan
was among them he was dolans
fireman the odds were on tommy up
to the night that carson another fire-
man joined the brigade of suitors
after that it was another story

  it began the night of the firemens
annual ball carson was there he
was a switch engine man never would
be anything else to this day i never
see a collar ad that i dont think of
carson his wavy brown hair his white
hands his brown eyes

  a handsome lad but he could fire
an engine even if he did look as if
he had just stepped out of a tailors
bandbox carson boasted that lots of
the girls footed the bills for the privi-
lege of a date with him he was a
born heartbreaker and he knew it bet-
ter than anyone

  none of us ever dreamed of his pick-
ing out mary not with tommy bran-
nigan as her almost steady who would
have laid down his life for her at her
summertime snow



asking and dolan being what he was
-the railroads most famous engi-
neer the first time he danced with
her most of us put it down to pure
courtesy but after the third straight
dance with the switch engine dude we
all sat up and took notice

   this ought to be good said one
of the women at the dance  two
heartbreakers together the irresist-
ible force and the immovable object
have met at last

   he wont go very far there put
in another  daredevil dolan will put
a stop to that right now

   or tommy brannigan added one
of the husbands

  in that they were all wrong dolan
was there but he made no move to in-
terfere being the redheaded irishman
he was tommy brannigan did inter-
fere to his sorrow that was after
the third dance mary had with carson

   i wish you wouldnt dance any
more with carson mary tommy
told her  hes not your kind

   but hes such a wonderful dan-
cer mary raved  just like floating
on air i could die dancing with a man
like that honestly tommy hes the
handsomest man i ever saw in all my
fife dont you think so

   no t tommy growled  i dont
youre jealous mary laughed
pleasantly

   just the same dont dance with
him any more tommy warned her

  the dolans were noted for not
liking bosses no other suitor would
have dared talk like that to her she
threw back her black head angrily

   dont talk like that to me tommy
brannigan im not your servant ill
dance with whom i please and what
could you do if i did

   ill wait till you do tommy an-
swered coldly  then ill show you

he walked away leaving mary
fighting mad so was tommy
for that matter but he did not
rage tommy was not that kind i
think it was his quietness his stead-
fastness that had helped him hold the
inside track over all of marys suitors
there was a hint of strength in tom-
my in spite of his great love for her
she had never been able to bend him
completely to her will

  oh yes mary danced with carson
perhaps it was to show her independ-
ence if she expected tommy to come
running to her to beg dances she was
mistaken tommy took to dancing
with alice wilson also the widow
stitts whose husband had left her ten
thousand dollars life insurance and
who was in the market for another
man

  not once during the rest of the eve-
ning did mary and tommy dance to-
gether the  home sweet home 
waltz was with carson for mary bat-
tle smoke was in the air mary was
furious tommy cold and silent

   ill never go to another dance with
you again tommy brannigan mary
stormed  you disgraced me before
everybody by your actions

   you disgraced yourself tommy
retorted  and made a monkey out
of me

   youre a cheap sport said mary

   perhaps tommy admitted  but
not cheap enough to compete for your
favors against a man like carson

   youre not going to get the chance
again mary raged  you and i are
quits tommy brannigan i never
want to see you again never

  tommy stared  you mean that
mary he asked

   i do mary flung at him  you
talk about mr carson but at least he
has manners and is a gentleman


railroad stories

thats more than you will ever be a
woman could be proud of a man like
that

   i see tommy nodded  im
sorry mary

  they parted at the dolan gate
mary in tears tommy half stunned
out on the road the next day tommy
baled coal into the firebox with a
thoughtful face if dolan noticed he
said nothing he was wise never a
question from him as to why tommy
had not been up to the house

  dolan knew so did everyone else
in town mary was going everywhere
with carson it was that which caused
tommy to make his decision

   im leaving pineville tim he
told dolan one day  im taking a
freight turn

  dolan looked at his pipe and then
out the cab window  i think youre
foolish no general ever won a battle
by retreating from the field what is
worth having is worth fighting for

   love should not have to be fought
for tommy said stubbornly  she
prefers carson she told me so im
stepping aside gracefully it will be
hard to leave you tim but better for
all concerned he paused  i had
hoped you would not let her run
around with carson

   i would be a foolish man to tell
her no dolan replied  the dolans
do not take kindly to dictation and
forbidden things are always sweetest
tommy dropped the subject a few
days later he went to the freight job
on the marland branch that was in
october

up on the marland branch tom-
my brannigan worked hard try-
ing to forget the girl he loved no
easy task when the girls blue eyes
looked back at him from every firebox

door a dozen times he was on the
verge of throwing up the job and re-
turning to pineville only his pride
kept him from it that and marys
parting words

  spring came to the siwash division
and the world in general but not to
the heart of tommy brannigan it
was then that dolans turn came up
for a fireman the urge to return was
almost irresistible what puzzled tom-
my was that the bulletin called for
the  overland flyer  instead of the
 pride of the rockies he wrote out
a bid only to tear it up later to his
surprise a young fireman was assigned
to the turn

  after that a succession of bulletins
advertised dolans turn those bulle-
tins bewildered tommy of course
dolan was no easy man to fire for but
that could not explain the constant
changing of firemen the answer
came one day when the last fireman to
hold dolans turn showed up at mar-
land

   do not breathe this to a living
soul brannigan said the fireman
 the fact is dolan has gone nutty-
plumb cuckoo-since he killed the little
gypsy girl in peters pass lost his
nerve couldnt make the limiteds
time so they put him on the flyer
same there local officials are wor-
ried if the big boys ever get wise
to whats wrong dolan will be out of
a job

   i cant believe it tommy mut-
tered  that doesnt sound like dolan
he wouldnt lose his nerve over an
accident that couldnt be helped

   it wasnt the accident protested
the fireman  it was the curse

  curse tommy scoffed how
silly dolan would laugh at such a
thing he frowned and who cursed
him 
summertime snow



   the gypsy girls mother it must
have been a terrible curse from what
i hear she said he would lose his
health and his wealth and his job be-
fore another winter came that bad
luck and death would be the lot of him
and his to the end all of his loved
ones so the old gypsy said would die
in the snow just like her child but his
own grave would be a snowbank in
the pass that even the sun of the sum-
mer could not melt

   and dolan believed that rub-
bish tommy asked

   maybe not then but he sure does
now said the fireman  the bank
where he kept his money failed and
he lost all he had then the two homes
he had in englewood burned down
without any insurance the insurance
had not been renewed by dolan for-
got it i guess soon after that he got
word that his brother bob dolan
roadmaster on the mohawk was found
frozen to death in a snowdrift they
say his speeder must have jumped the
track and thrown him against some-
thing which stunned him the fact
remains he is dead as the old gypsy
predicted

   thats queer tommy mused  i
dont understand it he never used
to be superstitious

   youd never know dolan went
on the fireman  hes ages older
talks to himself on the run and is
always looking for snow in the pass
thats why they cant keep a fireman
with him they talk of putting him
on a plug run or letting him go the
gypsy curse has sure got him

  to hell with curses tommy ex-
ploded wrathfully  ill fire for him
and all the spooks in the world can
ride with us if they want to timothy
dolan is not going on any plug run if
i can help it well beat the gypsy

curse or know the reason why im
going back to pineville

tommy did it was a good excuse
at least mrs murphy his old
landlady who had always been more
or less of a mother to him wel-
comed him from her he learned about
dolan-and mary

   shes engaged to marry carson
the scalawag mrs murphy told him
everybody is surprised because they
never figured he was a marrying man
ill always think he brought them the
bad luck in place of the gypsy good-
ness knows theyve had little else since
the two got engaged but she seems
mighty happy and proud over her
catch bad luck to him

  tommy said nothing to this after
the widow murphy had run out of
talk tommy went down to the round-
house to see about the turn with do-
lan he had been assigned to it on
his way out master mechanic allison
called to him

   i see you got dolans turn son
he began  i suppose you know what
has been going on

   yes said tommy

   see if you can get him to make the
time allison begged  we all like
dolan would do anything to help him
but we have come to the end of our
rope the higher officials are getting
curious you know how crazy they are
about their passenger runs we cant
go on forever putting the blame on the
engines that reflects back on us and
puts us in bad

   you wont have to make excuses
any more tommy promised  dolan
will make the time with me he al-
ways did hell do it again

   i hope so allison sighed  its
all up to you

  tommy caught the run that night


railroad stories

dolan was oiling around when tom-
my went out to where the  was
waiting but it was not the dolan
tommy used to know no longer was
the black cap perched jauntily over the
right ear instead it was pulled down
tightly over his forehead the corncob
pipe was clenched between his teeth
and right side up and the blue eyes
held the shadows of a thousand fears
and sorrows the old daredevil
looked at tommy as at another ghost
you was all he said

   me tommy replied holding out
his hand  ive come back

  dolan ignored the outstretched hand
and climbed into the cab just as the
engine herder gave them the signal to
come back to the train conductor
avery was waiting with the orders
as soon as he had read them to do-
lan he hurried away in the olden
days conductors had always stopped
to chat awhile with dolan

  tommy finished taking water they
highballed a few miles out of elm-
wood they swung into the narrow
winding gorge known as peters pass
it was when they struck the first curve
that dolan began to squirm on his seat

  a moment later he had eased off the
throttle and was leaning far out the
window to gaze at the track ahead
dolans blue eyes were wide and star-
ing his whole body tense as if under
a strain and his lips were moving al-
though no words came

  the engine began to slow down until
it was making a bare twenty miles an
hour that was enough for tommy
he crossed and took hold of the throt-
tle one pull and the  responded
like the thoroughbred it was dolan
gave a gasp

   dont lad he said  we must
go slow

   not tonight tommy gritted

 were going through on time widen
on her if youre afraid to run let me
take her ill make the time

  dolan shook his head  soon well
be there lad ill show you where i
killed her such a pretty child she was
with her brown hair and eyes as
pretty as my mary ever dared be

   never mind that tommy said
 forget it

   forget it dolan shrilled  i
wish i could forget the dying child and
the curses of her mother curses that
are coming true one by one

 shame tommy snapped to
think a good irishman like you would
give heed to the words of an ignorant
gypsy go take my seat ill run the
engine if a thousand curses from a
thousand gypsies were on us all

  and before dolan could stop him
tommy had given the throttle another
yank dolan screamed as the engine
leaped forward his hands sought the
brake valve but tommy blocked him
the same with the throttle

   well all be killed dolan
shrieked  stop lad-for gods sake
stop

  but tommy did not stop he lifted
dolan bodily and deposited him on the
other seat across the cab another fire
and tommy was back at the throttle
the huge engine tore through the pass
that night like a meteor through the
sky all the while dolan sat hunched
on tommys seat trembling in every
limb

   death waits he yelled to tommy
once a bony finger pointing dowrn the
track  soon youll see the snow
waiting for us banks of it lad
shrouds for you and me they are she
said so

  tommys heart grew heavy but he
never slackened the pace it seemed an
eternity before they were out of the
summertime snow



pass and on the straight stretch of
track leading into dearville wiping
the cold sweat from his face he turned
to dolan

   take her tim were through
now

  dolan lifted a haggard face  you
were foolish lad now the curse will
be upon you as well as me

   ill risk the curses said tommy
grimly  but curse or no curse were
making the time on this run from now
on even if i have to run the engine
myself

they were on time at columbia
up in the offices the dispatchers
commented on it so did allison
when the flyer returned to pineville
on time the next night allison stopped
tommy on his way to the washroom

   nice work son he praised  i
knew you could do it keep it up

   i intend to tommy replied

  he passed on leaving allison smil-
ing just outside the gate he met
mary dolan hurrying towards the
roundhouse no doubt on her way to
meet carson and walk home with him
tommy thought and the feeling of
loneliness in his heart deepened he
lifted his hat not daring to hope she
would speak she did not but she
nodded and half paused then seemed
to change her mind and hurried on

  two more trips tommy made be-
fore he saw mary dolan again that
was at the church social it was in the
hope of seeing mary that tommy went
he was not disappointed mary was
there waiting on tables so was car-
son his handsome face wearing a
scowl peevishly and ill at ease he
stood aloof showing his feelings plain-
ly for all to see that he was not find-
ing any pleasure or enjoyment there
dolan was absent

   he feels his disgrace stated mrs
murphy  folks pity him and the
dolans cant stand pity mary is no
different look at the way she holds
up her head proudest of the proud
shell be needing it a poor market
she is driving her ducks to this june
when she weds that scalawag of a car-
son

 tommy said nothing he was
watching mary the while she laughed
and joked with those at the tables but
tommy sensed a false note there
were circles under the blue eyes which
belied complete peace of mind and hap-
piness

   mr allison has told me what you
did for daddy she began when she
came to his table to wait on him pre-
tending the while to clear the table  i
dont suppose you care but i want to
tell you how much mother and i ap-
preciate it weve been so worried i
never dreamed you would ever come
back to pineville

   i had to come back said tommy
truthfully  your father was a friend
to me when i needed it most you tell
your mother not to worry ill look
after tim

  tears came into mary dolans eyes
but she wiped them away quickly at
the same time tommy saw carson
coming towards them he drew mary
aside and talked earnestly what he
said tommy never knew until long
afterwards but the hurt in marys
blue eyes told tommy that carson was
being brutal about something a few
moments later they departed together
tommy soon followed

tommy did not see mary again
the next week night after night
he ran the engine while dolan huddled
on the firemans seatbox head buried
in hands later on tommy hoped to


railroad stories

get dolan to the point of running the
engine himself somehow he felt that
once dolan could conquer his fear the
end would be in sight it came as a
surprise to find dolan offering to run
the engine this night

   ill run her lad he told tommy
 youve done enough no more will
you have to be worried by an old man
like me some day ill make it up to
you for all the trouble ive been

   youve never been any trouble
tommy denied

   spoken like my own son said
dolan  once i had hopes you might
be lad

   ill always love her tim tommy
replied  always

   you would said dolan an odd
look on his face  youre that kind
it takes the test of battle to tell true
loves from false ones weve won our
battle lad already have we put the
enemy to flight

  of course tommy agreed  and
if you will run the engine-

  oh ill run the engine dolan
laughed loudly  not only tonight
but for all the nights to come our
winter is over lad gone is the sum-
mertime snow there is music in my
heart soon there will be a song on
your lips and a smile in your eyes
tommy turned away something
akin to a smile was on dolans face
and that smile brought dismay to
tommy no need to tell him what
had happened dolan had broken un-
der the strain of his worries this
was the beginning of the end no
more would he be able to help the old
daredevil no more would he be able
to shield him once the truth was
known

  swallowing the lump in his throat
tommy got down to put in a fire back
on the seatbox he looked out upon a

night made for lovers high in the sky
rode a silvery moon the same kind of
a moon that had been the night he
and mary parted forever soon she
would be carsons wife

  he stole an anxious glance at dolan
as they neared the entrance of the pass
what he saw made him look again to
make sure he was not dreaming
dolan was there sitting at the throttle
as easily as he might a rocking chair
at home the daredevils left hand
held the throttle and his eyes were
glued to the rails beyond atop his
graying head the black cap perched
rakishly over one ear while the corn-
cob pipe was upside down as in the
days of old

  nor was there any change in the
engineer when they swept into the pass
at a sixty mile clip on the tiny grade
the old master of them all gently
dropped the johnson bar a notch on
the quadrant and nodded in a satisfied
way as the iron steed barked its will-
ingness

   but its too late now tommy-
thought sadly  too late

  on raced the engine still dolan
held the pace tommy had just fin-
ished putting in a fire when he saw
dolan half rise to his feet and thrust
his head out the window to stare down
the track ahead too well tommy
knew what that meant one jump and
he was at dolans side blocking the
hand that reached for the brakes

  not tonight tim tommy said
gently  remember you promised-
 dont lad dolan yelled  look
ahead there in the pass stop

dolan was fighting frantically
now for the control of the brake
valve-fighting as only an insane man
could fight doggedly tommy hung
on unheeding dolans pleas to look
summertime snow



ahead some will beyond his own
made tommy glance through the little
window in the front of the cab what
he saw there made his hands drop
away he stared

 and well he might stare snow
blocked the pass beyond pile after
pile of it rising and falling in the
bright moonlight as if it were alive
a tiny shock barely felt tommy
heard the hiss of escaping air saw
dolan put the sanders to work in des-
perate effort to stop the train before
they struck too late already the
first flurry of snow was sifting into the
cab-snow as soft assilk and warm as
thistledown then more snow
tommy never saw the huge white ball
that hurtled in the window and sent
him crashing against the coal gates
there to sink into the deep black pit
beyond

  it was three days later that tommy
climbed out of the pit to find himself
in the hospital three cracked ribs a
broken shoulder and slight concussion
of the brain were his to show for the
accident his first thought was for
dolan

   walking about as fine as can be
the nurse told him  only a broken
arm now you be quiet so you can
get well maybe theyll let you see him
tomorrow that will please hm hes
been worried sick over you so has
somebody else i know of now lie
clown and go back to sleep

  tommy obeyed after all nothing
mattered now but he did wonder
who else could be worried about him
mrs murphy probably she was the
only other he could think of it was
two days later before he knew that
was when they permitted dolan to see
him dolan with arm in a sling and
contrition in his blue eyes

   its happy i am to see you coming

around dolan said brokenly  id
never have rested easy had you died
can you forgive an old man for his
deceiving you so 

  deceiving tommy repeated
 i dont understand tim what do
you mean

   i mean there never was any sum-
mertime snow dolan confessed  it
was all make believe for carsons bene-
fit his engagement to mary almost
broke my heart i knew she did not
love him selfish and conceited that he
was his kind wras not for her but
i dared not cross her she has a will
of her own as you well know

   yes i know tommy admitted
eyes gloomy

   maybe i was a little crazy dolan
went on  most irishmen are when
love goes deep when the bank failed
and the houses burned right on the
heels of the accident in the pass and
the gypsys curse i had an idea i
would pretend that i had lost all my
money and that the houses were not
insured i was pretty sure that car-
son would not be so eager to marry
mary then his kind loves money

  and you were wrong tommy
sighed  he still kept on

   he did dolan admitted  maybe
the scamp did love her in his own way
but i could see he weakened a little
then i grew desperate the gypsys
curse came back to me of course
that was out the old hag took back
her words when the claim department
paid her five hundred dollars but
nobody knew it but me and the claim
department i decided to pretend i
was losing my mind and give carson
something to think about in earnest
if he could stand the disgrace of be-
ing related to a crazy father-in-law
with the prospects of having to sup-
port him and his family for the rest


railroad stories

of his life then i would have to admit
i was beaten

   and you risked your job and
marys happiness to do it tommy
asked  dont you think you took a
big chance tim 

   men have risked their jobs for a
lot less dolan retorted  lives too
but marys happiness was not to be
found with carson she never loved
him her heart was with a certain
young man who ran away and left her
she thought her engagement to carson
would bring him back when it did
not she lost heart then you came
back

   i thought you needed me tim
 i did dolan told him  so did
mary the night at the social taught
her that it was then and there she gave
carson the mitten and his engagement
ring i knew it the night i promised
to run the engine myself perhaps i
should have told you but somehow i
was afraid you would not take it kindly
and might run out on me as you did
on mary

   and lost my chance for happi-
ness tommy sighed  i was silly
 you were wise in a way dolan
contradicted  i was the one who
was wrong in saying no general ever
won a battle by running away would
you like to see mary lad  she has all
but lived at this hospital since you were
hurt

  tommy could only stare at this piece
of news mary had come to see him
and he had thought it was mrs
murphy that meant she must love
him he started to tell dolan to have
her in only to see dolan at the door
and calling to someone in the hall

   the young idiot is sane once more
mary come in and get him

and thats the story of dolans
summertime snow knowitall
finished  they were married in june
dolan gave them a home as a wedding
present he had little money in the
bank when it failed and the houses
were insured a smart man was dolan
he was not given to gambling except
when the odds were all in his favor

   seems to be he did in risking his
job like he did grunted the old
boomer

   with a brother-in-law holding
down the chair of general manager
dryly from knowitall  not to men-
tion a cousin who was superintendent
of motive power dolan was not one
given to boasting i doubt that any of
the men knew it at the time i did not
for years neither did brannigan until
after his marriage

   just one thing more said the old
boomer  dolan admitted he faked
being crazy and that the gypsy took
back her curse and all that but how
about the snow in the pass

   there was no snow smiled
knowitall  it was sheep three
thousand head the owner was taking
to the hills for summer grazing dolan
knew what they were he was looking
out of the cab wirdow you know
tommy was looking through the little
window in front of the cab and his
vision was blurred then too he had
his mind on seeing snow he tumbled
to what was wrong just about the time
they struck the first stragglers in ad-
vance of the huge flock you know

benny the bum

by asahel nielson

  enny sat in a box car raking
a dirty thumb nail through
i ejmj a week-old beard he had
- done nothing else for an
hour because there was
nothing else to do benny was a me-
chanical engineer in name if in noth-
ing else he had been graduated in the
spring of  but no one seemed to
want an engineer of any kind in fact
no one seemed to want to hire anyone
to do anything

  of course benny could probably get
a job with the cvva or ccc but after
all that was almost like charity and
besides long before there was any
cwa or ccc benny had become a box
car bum now it was hard to change

  benny was startled from his con-
templation by three shots far down the
track shots didnt particularly interest
benny it was probably a cop after a
crook the number of crooks seemed to



be increasing every day however
since benny had nothing else to do he
leisurely got up and walked to the door

  yes it was undoubtedly a cop after
a crook of some sort there was a
short heavy-set man running down the
path between the tracks he seemed to
be about the same build as benny he
wore a long black coat and carried a
black traveling bag probably robbed
a bank or store and the loot was in it

  not far behind him was what benny
took to be a detective he had longer
legs and it was only a matter of time
until he overhauled the crook who
seemed to be almost exhausted

  as he watched the race benny sud-
denly got an idea he would high-jack
the loot and make a clean getaway
right under the nose of the cop why
not he was tired of being a bum
with a little stake he could go to an-
other locality and become a respectable

old lady luck
knocked - and
benny thought
his day had
come
benny the bum



man it would be no trick at all for
him to elude the cop in this large yard
full of cars there was no policeman
on earth who could follow benny in a
railroad yard and there was a freight
train due through in about five minutes

  but that would be the least of his
worries he could not allow the crook
to be caught because it would be evi-
dent that he had been high-jacked
then there would be a search for
benny this game would be risky to
say the least however benny deter-
mined to see it through

  ok buddy right in here whis-
pered benny as the crook was about to
pass by the car the short stubby man
was surprised at this unexpected as-
sistance but he was almost out of
breath and was willing to do almost
anything puffing and grunting he la-
boriously pulled himself into the car

  all right give me your coat and
bag and ill throw him off your trail
then ill meet you back here in about
ten minutes all you have to do is to
lay low assured benny in a soft hur-
ried whisper he was prepared to use
violence to obtain the coat and bag if
necessary with the man in that half
exhausted condition it would not have
taken much effort to throttle him

  but the fellow was willing to do just
as benny said it was only a matter of
seconds until benny wearing the coat
and carrying the bag appeared on top
of the car the officer naturally sup-
posed he was the man because benny
and the man were about the same build

the worst was over now benny
had the loot and it was only neces-
sary to keep the officer following him
and still stay out of gun range it
would not do to completely lose the
cop who might stumble onto the real
crook all that was necessary was to

allow the dick to see him catch the fast
freight which would be through soon
at the same time the cop would have
to fail to catch it then benny could
lose himself before the train reached
the next station and no one would ever
think of looking for him the train
would be gaining speed for the long
climb just beyond town so benny was
confident

  the light on the approaching engine
train appeared far down the track
benny led the cop over to the side of
the yards farthest from the main track
where the train would pass now it
was simply a matter of timing he
must not allow the officer to realize
that he intended to catch the rattler un-
til it was too late for him to catch it
already the engine was passing but
still benny loitered on the far side of
the yards the speck of green light
that was the caboose came nearer

  finally benny made a dash across
the yards idle cars waiting on the side
track seemed to help rather than hin-
der his progress one leap would place
him on the couplers and another would
send him lo the ground on the other
side the cop was left far in the rear
laboriously climbing over and under

  benny scrambled aboard on the third
car from the rear he was certain the
cop saw him catch it yes there was
the galoot running down the middle of
the track behind the cabose waving his
arms benny sat down on the running
board with the bag beside him from
now on he could take life easy

  the train began to slow down what
was the matter bennys eyes strained
toward the head end apparently
someone had left a switch open the
train would have to stop no a switch-
man was running to close it the train
was going slower the cop was gaining
would he catch the train before the


railroad stories

switch was closed then the switch-
man closed the switch the train gained
speed but it was too late the officer
made an extra effort and gained the
rear end of the caboose

  benny knew it would only be a mo-
ment until the cop explained to the
trainmen and that they would be on
top of the train after him he had to
think fast there must be some way
out yes there wras still hope he
could let them think they killed him it
would not be simple or safe but the
risk must be taken he couldnt allow
himself to be caught now benny
started running toward the engine
he had run over several cars when a
glance over his shoulder showed him
the cop and brakeman just climbing on
top of the caboose again it was a mat-
ter of timing he must be just at the
end of a car at the first shot

the timing was perfect benny
was at the end of a car when a shot
rang out the bullet certainly went
wild because benny didnt even hear
it whiz past him he had hoped that
the first shot would come closer but he
had to take things as they came he
allowed his legs to crumple under him
he fell face down with his arms hang-
ing over the end of the running board
his hands groped and found the run-
ning board braces one hand still held
the precious bag

  they both closed around the iron
braces then he rolled off the end of
the car for a moment he hung by his
hands he dropped to the swaying
couplers where he almost lost his bal-
ance here his long training as a bum
stood him in good stead anyone not
accustomed to moving freight trains
would have fallen under the wheels
but benny with an almost super-hu-
man effort regained his balance

  on one side the mountain towered
into the sky darkness had fallen and
the canyon on the other side was noth-
ing but a splotch of blackness benny
only paused a brief fraction of a sec-
ond on the couplers it had to appear
to the men on the train that he fell
he jumped clear of the cars and rolled
down the steep side of the canyon

  on the train the detective futilely
emptied his gun at the rolling figure

  the next morning found benny far
from the spot where he had fallen from
the train he had found the bag to
contain bills lots of united states
currency mostly small bills that were
new and crisp the kind of money one
dreams of it was small enough to use
without suspicion

  benny chuckled he had carefully
hidden the bag and coat and distributed
the bills in his ragged clothing now
he was sitting on a pile of ties waiting
for a freight train that would take him
far from his old stamping ground
since he had come over a hundred
miles on one train during the night he
felt fairly safe from pursuit

  a passenger train thundered by a
man sitting on the rear platform tossed
benny a newspaper benny strolled
over and picked it up it would not be
long until he would be sitting on rear
platforms tossing old papers to bums
along the track as benny opened the
paper a headline hit him in the face

detective kills counterfeiter
on freight train

  he feverishly began digging in his
dirty clothing for the bills    yes
they were counterfeit   

  benny sat in a box car raking a dirty
thumb nail through a week-old beard
he had done nothing else for an hour
because there was nothing else for him
to do
railroads that vanished

one would expect railroads to stay put but such is not always the case nearly ten
years ago officials of the french war office who were sent to overhaul a railroad
that had been constructed during the world war along the valley of puisieux near
albert could find no trace of it they were puzzled finally they learned from peas-
ants in the vicinity that  foreigners  had come into the neighborhood some time before
and removed all the rails ties and equipment down to the last spike where that par-
ticular railroad was re-laid-if indeed it was re-laid-is a mystery that may never be
solved

     another instance was the disappearance in  of a french branch line between
joigny and ville larcheveque upon which the department of yonne had been paying
subsidy the lines just simply vanished folded their tents like the arabs and as
silently stole away who took them and why are riddles which baffle the shrewdest
detectives in france central europe reported a similar case in  the cog railway
which ascended a steep mountain side at kahlenburg was closed during the war for
lack of tourists after the war when officials decided to reopen it they found only
one big broken cog of the funicular all the rest of the road had disappeared

     even in america a man stole a railroad  lock stock and barrel and got away
with it back in  the st louis  galveston coal mining co began operations at
hickory hill near lehigh oklahoma their property was located four miles from the
m-k-t and in order to get their output to market it was necessary for them to build
a railroad from hickory hill to midway where it connected with the katy midway
is about two miles south of lehigh

    the company bought a dinky four-wheeled locomotive which they named  old
hickory and for a while business was humming but in  on account of the ex-
cessive cost of mining hickory hill coal the company suspended operation there in
 a quiet fellow came to lehigh with a letter apparently from the mining company
stating he had purchased the railroad and had the authority to remove it after order-
ing parts for the engine and getting her in running order the stranger proceeded to
take up the track and sell it to a ballast company

     later an auditor for the st l  g arrived in lehigh to check up on their property
the caved-in slope of the mine and the roadbed where the railroad had been were about
all the assets he could find the letter authorizing the man to remove the road proved
to be a forgery a settlement is said to have been made by the ballast company at
mill creek to the coal company for the theft in time the mysterious stranger was
captured but broke jail and was never brought to trial

     the ballast company later went out of business  old hickory  rusted until 
when she and the railroad were sold for junk but it was found that back taxes were
more than the property was worth so the sale was cancelled several years passed
the frisco got tired of having  old hickory  take up space on their sidetrack to
which she had been moved when the sale was attempted the old abandoned engine
was picked up and set out on the frisco right-of-way she reposes there today in a
jungle of underbrush reminiscent of a north woods tragedy jan  and a
trip that cost   dec  in  the oklahoma mining  stripping co
re-laid the hickory hill track and operated a strip coal pit at that place for years

    old-timers say while  old hickory  was sitting out on the track near lehigh
kids from miles around would gather there and play railroad there was genuine grief
when the engine steamed away and rejoicing when the man who stole her was cap-
tured-e n martel


the ballast scorcher

by boomer bill hayes

      ex-enginer author of
       the santa fe trail etc

there had always been exceptions to rules
but trainmaster shively hadnt believed it before

-yll bracken came out of
mv the long saluda cut with
a stuttering burst of ex-
ttl- haust in his stack and his
smoke plume flattening
down over his cab roof the thunder
of his flight changed as the high rock
walls fell behind him and he straight-
ened on the mesa

  he hung loosely in the right-hand
cab window of the  sighted along
the boiler saw the white  extra  flag
on his engine snapping in the breeze
his ears were attuned to the symphony
of his running the crash of tires on
rail joints the blubbering steam

against the pops the rock ballast was
a gray blur hurling itself at his pilot
disappearing beneath and behind him
he notched his lever higher cracked
his throttle wider turned to watch his
fifty cars trail true behind him

  he was a young man with a clcan
strong face and a lazy smile he let
his smile broaden as his fireman jerked
at his sleeve

   you got better sense gil the
fireman was saying

gil looked at him with frank eyes
elevated one brow better sense
 you know what it says in the
book the fireman cautioned  youre
the ballast scorcher



just about burnin the ties now if
ever   

  gil bracken knew his speed he
also knew what it said there on the in-
side cover of the division timetable
just a paragraph under the heading
of  speed restrictions and said
freight trains should not exceed a
speed of forty miles an hour it also
said freight trains carrying wrecker
equipment should not exceed a speed
of twenty-five miles

  gil held his watch in his big hand
the watch said  pm the pilot
was closing in on the whistle post which
called for a crossing blast gil put his
watch back he knew he was violat-
ing that time card restriction but he
had a reason if he didnt hustle hed
show up at the terminal on overtime
and there was a general order under
the old mans signature that overtime
must be cut out there was no excuse
for overtime other than engine failure
on the road wrecks or other acts often
erroneously attributed to the deity
gil bracken had been in no wreck nor
had his engine quit on the job

  gil bracken was behind with his
work because a well-meaning dis-
patcher with an over-burdened brain
had looked at his train sheet wrong
had issued a flock of orders and had
caused a convention of freight trains
at a wayside town with inadequate sid-
ing facilities

  the net result had been a lot of
dumb delay that would be tough to
explain the only way to avoid ex-
planation would be to make up a little
of the time the only way to make up
the time was to run for it and when
it came to running for it gil bracken
was the man who could

  perhaps if gil hadnt been so handy
at speedy running he never would
have got into trouble or perhaps if

gil hadnt bowed and smiled one sum-
mer evening to a lady by the name of
hope his speed would never have
been held against him

  in any event gils record in the
superintendents file wasnt exactly
the kind a young man contemplating
matrimony should have it was full
of black marks it was studded with
notations of days without pay served
as penalty for this or that offense
most of the offenses read  excessive
speed between so and so

  each time the complaining officer
was trainmaster shively shively also
was a young gentleman with a frosty
mien and a great disappointment in
life he always felt he had seen hope
storey first thus when engineman
gilbert bracken had come along and
turned the ladys fancy he blamed it
on bracken

gil jerked his whistle cord at the
post the engine slammed past
it rocking with the give of the rails
gil mentally calculated what it would
take in the way of running to get in
under the wire he knew he could take
no more chances with his record
shively only needed one more whack
at him if he made overtime on this
trip it would be too bad

  of course he might try to blame the
dispatcher he might try yeh just
try to hang anything on the dispatcher
he was the one guy who has first
chance to cover himself and no dis-
patcher ever intends to be caught
napping why right now gil reasoned
that train sheet would be all fixed up

  gil looked back along the wheel line
the extra rolled with the wind and
like the wind across a gentle curve
he saw the caboose whipping his
lazy smile widened he thought of
hope and took a deep breath thats


railroad stories

the way she affected him every time
he saw her there was always that
breathless feeling

  he would see her tonight june was
a week away the first week of that
month she would lay aside her white
uniform of nurse in the company hospi-
tal at the terminal and go over to the
ministers house with him then in a
few minutes they would come out to-
gether and life would be wonderfully
new and different

  he half closed his eyes as he turned
from the caboose he let his gaze play
over the hills he sniffed the fragrance
of the full spring he could even ex-
press kindliness and love toward so
low a person as shively he even
told himself shively was a good guy
even if he did try to make mountains
out of mole hills yes sir shively
meant well

  it was unfortunate that gil at the
moment failed to look about him
thoroughly had he done so he might
have seen a gentleman sitting on the
side of a hill almost on a line with
what whistle post gil had just passed
looking closer he might have recog-
nized shively and seen him writing
something in a book he also would
have lost any feeling of good will

the old man looked like his
dyspepsia or whatever it was that
ailed him might be several degrees
worse he kept his big hands folded
over the rise and fall of his watch
chain he didnt move he sat listen-
ing intently

  trainmaster shively wore a self-
satisfied smile he was a slim man
he sat at the old mans right next
to shively was mr horn the assistant
trainmaster who seemed in many re-
spects a carbon copy of his immediate
superior horn was a little fuller in

build he had been a trainmasters
clerk before his elevation and there-
fore was familiar with the shively
school of supervising officers

  this was the picture engineman gil
bracken faced at ten oclock on the
morning following his flight out of
the long saluda cut he came in
from the old mans outer room with
an expectant smile on his features
speaking cordially to those present he
met their chill glances and stopped
where he was the call boy had sum-
moned him at ten but he had no inkling
as to what it was all about

  shively evidently didnt want to
keep him in ignorance very long the
trainmaster didnt even motion him to
a chair but merely said

   well bracken its too bad

  gil immediately drew himself up
his lazy smile vanished he looked
from one to the other of those hostile
faces quickly

  whats too bad gil asked he
kept his voice quiet

   same old charge the old man
muttered  it looks like youd never
get some sense

   same old- gil began as he
locked glances with shively

   from saluda cut to washpan
shively said thinly  you know what
time you passed the whistle post out of
saluda cut

  gil remembered having looked at his
watch the cords in his throat
tightened

   one fifteen or sixteen he said
 something like that

   lets see your watch shively
snapped

  gil held out his watch shively
looked at it compared it with his
the superintendent and the assistant
trainmaster studied the two dials

   three seconds different shively
the ballast scorcher



said  i clocked you by that whistle
post at sixteen compare your watch
with mr horns

  horn smirked he held his watch
out the comparison showed a dif-
ference of eight seconds

   i suppose he clocked me gil said
savagely but still quiet  at-

  at washpan switch shively cut
in  eight miles he clocked you
there at  seven minutes a little
better than sixty-eight miles an hour
with a freight train

  gil swallowed a hot retort he said
evenly you laid for me you
got me so what he knew it would
do no good to put up a defense he
knew shively had always had it in for
him but he never expected anything
like this

   im sorry shively said

   like hell gil cut in he couldnt
help it

   remember your place mr horn
simpered he glared at gil stonily
 you know why we have rules youve
been warned enough

  the old man raised his eyes from
the official record his face was im-
passive his eyes opaque he said
 from the looks of this record brack-
en and from your continued defiance
of restrictions-well you dont leave
me much choice

  the old man wrote a word across
the face of the record in bold script
he tossed it over to gil with an air
of finality

  gil bracken looked at the word
red spots showed on his cheeks his
impulse was to wipe the smirk from
horns face with good hard knuckles
to crack the ice on shivelys pan with
a blow from the knees instead he
thought of hope and felt suddenly
weak at his stomach he took his hat
and walked out slowly

hope held her hands clasped
tightly her breast fluttered
under the white starch of her uniform
with her quick breathing her eyes
flamed for a moment

   gil she said  they cant do this
to you they simply cant

   they did gil said

   but the brotherhood hope per-
sisted  the committee-

   i saw the committee gil said
 the griever dont hold out much
hope you see after alls said an
done they got me kinda dirty may-
be the way they went after it

   yes hope admitted  but sure-
ly-perhaps if i talked to mark shive-
ly i could make him see-

   thatd tickle him half to death
gil broke in  thats just what hed
like to have you do come to him on
your knees no thats out the
griever told me hed do everything he
could he told me they were trying
their best to nail shively to the cross
you know setting an automatic block
right smack in a mans face out at
some lonely place then hiding there
in the weeds to see if the man will
stop

   but there must be something she
insisted

   theres waiting hope gil said
quietly  weve got to wait thats
sure

  wait she laid her hand in his
they looked at each other a long time

  june came gil bracken ex-engineer
and hope storey nurse did not go
through the vine-covered gate at the
parsonage to come out in a different
life they met instead and found it
hard to speak in their waiting

  one evening gil said  i talked to
the griever again today hope hes
taking my case up with the general

brotherhood spokesman


railroad stories

manager at the meeting next tuesday
it may be that he can make the official
listen to me thats what hes hoping
for hes taking up my case along
with charlie spratts

  charlie spratt hope looked at
him closely  what happened to
charlie

   they got him last week gil ex-
plained  threw a red board in his
face just as he came out of saluda
cut on that curve there he saw the
board and the light was green he
turned to say something to his fireman
then he looked at the steam gage
finally when he looked ahead again
he was past the board he didnt know
it had been thrown shively and horn
were there and they threw the signal
by electric contact then they testi-
fied at the investigation that charlie
had seen it in plenty of time to stop
but had ignored it there was two
against one charlies on the anxious
bench along with me

   hes got a wife and three kids
hope reminded him

   hes fifty-two years old gil
added bitterly

  hope rose and walked to the end
of the porch and back her silhouette
in the shadows made her seem taller
gil stood beside her and they leaned
on the railing

  gil looked at his watch it was
 he picked up his hat held it
jfor a long moment looking at it then
he took hopes hand and held that
they were standing thus when the
wrecker whistle blew

then the engine caller came yell-
ing breathlessly through the dark
bracken gil bracken you up
there gil

  in the shadow on the porch gil
stood by hope storey

   im here gil called

  the boy came running

   you they want you now

  gil took the youths arm  easy
kid whats-

   dont stop for questions they
said to get bracken they aint got
any engineers ready an theres an
extra in the ditch an pink shivelys
pinned under it some of the crews
bad hurt an-

  hope was at his side as gil loped
up the quiet street the wrecker
whistle rose and fell its wail an eerie
thing in the fastness of the night its
tortured voice sent chills up and down
the spine and those who live in the
railroad world dread the sound be-
cause they never know when its blow
is a message of death and destruction
to them

  they came to the depot platform and
they saw the people milling about
there would be wives and mothers
making anxious queries wtho piled
up how many hurt anybody
killed

  hope panted  theres doctor
walling ill go with him

  she left hurriedly fixing her cap on
the great wave of her straw-colored
hair she ran for the coach which a
yard engine was hooking on behind
the equipment weaving through the
men hurrying to man the big hook

  assistant trainmaster horn came
out from the train shed with a lantern
in his hand his face was grave and
his simpering had disappeared

   ready bracken he snapped the
question not facing the engineer

   im reinstated  gil demanded

   get on horn said he still
wouldnt look at gil

  the old man plowed up puffing like
a hog on a relentless grade  wheres
the skipper he asked
the ballast scorcher



   how about me  gil inquired
 im supposed to be discharged

  the old man growled  find the
conductor horn we cant stand here
all night

  running out of the depot waving
his arms the operator cried  oh mr
horn mr horn the conductor
of the wrecker just called in from the
siding at washpan the wreckage is
on fire hes yellin for help

  wreckage on fire gil heard and
turned to the engine he climbed up
the gangway steps the old familiar
smells smote his nostrils wreckage
on fire he knew what that could
mean

  he got aboard and found it was his
old love the  everything looked
the same as he plopped down on the
seat cushion even his old fireman
was on the job his fireman came
over

   who piled up gil asked he had
to shout to make himself heard above
the bedlam outside

   joe varick the fireman answered
naming an old engineer on the
curve just east of the long saluda
cut

  gil brackens eyes flamed  test
he asked

   test the fireman answered
 shively threw the automatic block
in joes face he big-holed her for
an emergency stop she broke in two
just behind the engine an took for the
cornfield the head brakeman was
ridin on top about ten cars behind-
tommy naylor-him an a cotipla
tramps an shively are all under the
wreckage from what i heard

  horn climbed to the deck with the
old man and horn yelled  lets
go

  gil looked back along the platform
he saw the skippers lantern toss the

highball he answered it with his
whistle he opened the throttle fed
sand to the tires the wrecker moved
the old man came over to stand be-
hind him

gil watched the red and green and
yellow of the yard lamps the
ruby and emerald of the old familiar
switches he kept his eye on them
and threaded his way over the tracks
then he came to the signal bridge at
the tower he eased under it opened
his throttle a little wider and followed
his headlight into the darkness

  in his minds eye he saw boldly
printed the letters in that paragraph
on the inside cover of the division time
card    freight trains carrying
wrecker equipment shall not exceed a
speed of twenty-five miles an hour  

  the old man fidgeted about at his
shoulder looked out at the night
then turned to the gages and other
gadgets he clasped and unclasped his
hands

  horn looked out frowned and con-
fronted the old man they both
faced gil

  the old man said  that wrecks
a-burning

  poor shively horn added
finally the old man yelled  good
god bracken cant you step on it
 the book says twenty-five

  gil turned to poke his head through
the window his very impulse was
to shout out against restrictions forty-
eight miles ahead of him on the
saluda curve four men were facing
death his fingers clenched around
the throttle

   theres exceptions bracken take
the bridle off the old man bawled

  gil brought his head in  theres
always been exceptions he retorted
 youd never believe it before


railroad stories

   as gods my witness the old
man growled

  gil faced horn  you heard that

   scorch the ballast horn agreed
he kept his eyes averted

  gil bracken was the kind of engi-
neer to whom speed came natural per-
fect master of his engine at every
point he could let it out at will he
knew what each curve and tangent
would stand and adjusted his pace ac-
cordingly he adjusted it without
conscious effort so that when his
drivers were turning over in a sicken-
ing blur there still was no sense of
anything out of the ordinary

  his throttle came back precisely to
a point he knew to be best for the
most efficient working his lever came
up on the quadrant and he could tell
by the throb of power in the feel of
it just where it should rest he paid
little attention to the terrain he knew
the road by some hidden sixth sense
and he knew just how to run

  his whistle was wide open as he
banged down on the station at ryeland
fifty cars in storage on a track be-
side the main rattled and crashed
against gils ear drums as he banged
by them he touched his air just
slightly for the curve beyond the water
tower looked back to see the grim
outline of the big hook following in
outline of the big hook following

  the old man had his watch in his
hand on the swing through the gap at
birdsong gil stole a look at him and
thought the old mans cheeks were
pale horn stood braced grimly in
the center of the deck thinking his
own thoughts with a downward droop
to the corners of his lips

  at  they whooped past wash-
xpan switch and the sky in the west
was an angry glowering red the old

man poked gil in the ribs and pointed
he yelled at horn the assistant
trainmaster hung over the gangway

  gil leaned far out his window he
watched the glow come nearer gone
from his mind was all sense of ani-
mosity all personal feelings upper-
most was the fact that four men faced
death-four human beings pinned
somewhere under the pile of cars a
railroader worthy of the name forgets
his grievances and his grudges in
situations like this

  they stopped at the washpan west
switch to make the necessary change
in their train they had to get the
big hook ahead of the engine that
was the first thing they would take
the rest of the cars behind them

  joe varicks engine was in the
washpan spur waiting to help gil
didnt see the other engineer as the
necessary maneuvers were made his
mind was intent only on the job at
hand

  horn and the old man had left him
to talk to the wrecked trains conduc-
tor who had brought his engine and
the two head cars remaining on the
tracks down to washpan for help

  everything was done by the whirl
of lanterns the moves were made
with amazing swiftness finally after
five minutes switching the big hook
was ahead of gils pilot and his skip-
pers lamp was signaling gil whistled
out and the conductor immediately
came aboard

  he looked for horn and the old
man he voiced a brief question as he
opened his throttle

   theyre back with the doctor an
the nurse in the hospital car the skip-
per said  joes fireman got hurt
pretty bad when joe made that stop
banged against the tool shelf above
the fire door caught his back joes
the ballast scorcher



skippers got a broken arm too an his
flagmans back of the wreck

  gil had to keep his speed down be-
cause the crane was in front to de-
rail that would spell the end the
minutes seemed hours the night was
sultry and the breeze his movement
stirred up was hot lightning flashed
in the far sky

  presently they were closing in and
the air was on the wheels gil was
leaning far out his eyes wide it was
incredible that an emergency braking
could wreak such havoc what had
been a fleet-wheeled merchandise hot-
shot was now a tangled pile not a
dozen of the fifty-odd cars in the train
had been left standing

  a brakeman cut gil and the big hook
loose from the rest of the train and
gil shoved up to the burning heap he
saw the crew of the big hook shield
eyes against heat and flame and felt
it in his nostrils sparks were spiral-
ing up in thick smoke that told him
somewhere in the conflagration an oil
car had added to the hazard

  gil could see the wrecking boss mak-
ing motions and the brakeman gave
him signals from the platform of the
crane the big crane swung out the
chains dropped over the wrecker
slashed at the pile sparks skyrocketed
as a burning car was dragged clear
and sent rolling down an embankment

ittle by little the wrecker ate in-
-to the mess minute by minute
gil tensed at his throttle finally he
turned to his fireman

   you take it he yelled

  the fireman took the engine gil
dropped down into the glaring light of
the fire and ran alongside the wreckage

  men shouted gil saw one go over
two others carried him out gil found
horn and the old man they were a

little beyond the main conflagration
standing down close to a place where
three box cars were pyramided gil
heard the old man yelling

   well be gettin to you hold on

  gil ran up  shively he asked

   shively the old man said
 theres somebody else under there
with him maybe the brakeman may-
be a tramp we dont know

  the heat its getting worse
shively cried  cant you do some-
thing

  gil could see his wild eyes shively
was on his back and his head and
shoulders were out from the pile but
his chest and legs were pinned down
hopelessly his eyes were terror-
stricken flame licked on the end of
the car farthest from him

   were coming in gil shouted

   look shivelys voice was a wild
shriek he closed his eyes

  gil looked and he and horn and
the old man had barely time to jump
back the big hook in trying to drag
another car free had slipped in slip-
ping the burning car piled over on the
mess under which shively lay the
wind fanned the flame the heat was
fierce

  a cry went up from the men trying
to anchor the hook and drag the chain
then gil saw them running back
coughing panting shouting

  we cant make it the sub-fore-
man yelled  we cant get the hook
onto a one of those cars

  gil grabbed the foreman by the
arm  get your men back he
snapped no use all of us getting
scorched theres one slim chance
he started running toward the engine

   what are you doing gil  hope
had come up and she was now run-
ning after him

   stay back gil cautioned her


railroad stories

   dont be a fool the old man
shouted he was beside himself

  but gil wasnt a fool he knew
what he wanted to accomplish he
reached the gangway and yelled for
the clinker hook then he told his
fireman to wet his coat and throw it
out

   when i give a signal he snapped
to the old man  make that engine
walk back from the blaze watch my
signals and whatever you do dont
delay passing em

  hands tried to restrain him as he
ran back to the pyre he wrapped the
wet coat around his mouth and nostrils
he pulled his goggles over his eyes
he was thankful that the lenses were
transparent and heat-proof at least
he could see without danger

  he grabbed up the steel hook on the
end of the chain it was a mans job
handling that alone he maneuvered
it around until he got his long-handled
clinker hook fixed onto it then flat-
tening himself on the ground he
wormed his way laboriously up to the
blaze

  his eyes were fastened onto a point
near the drawbar of the key car if
he just could keep conscious and hold
out until he could get that steel hook
shoved up under there and was sure
it had a hold-

  he forgot the shouts from the side-
lines paid no heed to the fact that the
increasing roar had driven the others
back he could not see them the
heat permeated the soaked coat and be-
gan to steam his face his overalls
were smoking

  finally when breathing became
more and more difficult and the roar
of the flames more terrific he braced
himself and maneuvered the handle of
his clinker hook which gave him about
a ten-foot reach he set the big steel

hook exactly where he wanted it took
plenty of time to be sure that he was
making no mistake and then anchored
the clinker hook so that it would serve
as sort of support to the big hook until
the wrecker could get the signal and
drag the chain taut

  now that this part of the job was
done he started backing away the
coat around his face was suffocating
him because it had heated through he
began choking and finally had to pull
it away from his nostrils he dared
not breathe now because he might in-
hale flame his clothes were on fire
and the torture was fierce but there
was nothing he could do about it he
backed out wobbling then he fell
over blackness engulfed him before
he heard the answering bark of the
engines exhaust

  as he went down he was covered
with a shower of sparks the key car
was yanked away from the one that
pinioned the victims and then hands
rushed in to carry him away

the new general manager walked
up and down by the window a
hill engine hissed by with her cylinder
cocks open a westbound man whis-
tled in the distance calling for the
gate out of the garden the helper
behind him answered the new general
manager turned he looked at engine-
man gilbert bracken then his gaze
rested on nurse hope storey

  gil held his right hand still because
the bandages were still large over it
and half up his arm there was new
skin in patches on his face

   mark shively quit last week had
an offer from some road out on the
coast the official stated as he blew
his nose

  gil raised his eyes he rested his
frank blue gaze on the big boss
the sunny side of the track



  the old man the g m said
 thought hed like a transfer hes
taking a long rest first got a new
super coming in this week

   but its about me-my reinstate-
ment i asked to see you gils mouth
was dry as he spoke

   sure the g m replied  thats
what i want to talk to you about too
thats why i mentioned about mr
shively he and mr horn leaving
us that way-why i thought maybe-
well look whenre you two getting
married 

   when you say i go back to work
gil replied his eyes were hopeful

   i tell you the g m started then
found something out the window to

attract his interest he kept looking
out while he talked  you two go
ahead heres a little sort of wedding
gift see he laid an envelope on
the table without facing gil and hope
 you two go ahead then you take
a little trip couple weeks by then
the bandages will all be off i wont
do anything about a trainmaster till
you get back then you can make up
your mind a man with your nerve
well   

  the g m watched them through
the window they went gil quite
breathlessly to a vine-covered gate
hope passed through it ahead of him
they passed up the parsonage walk

did the railroads passenger revenue increase
when they reduced fares last year-g h
m merrill wis

   the eastern roads did not reduce the standard
mile rate c for passenger fares but merely
offered the usual low round trip and week-end
rates with unusually cheap excursions now and
then the western and southern roads slashed
fares very considerably with one-way coach fares
as low as iltc a mile in the south and c a mile
in the west and c a mile c for -day round
trip in pullmans upon payment of the pullman
fare the surcharge which is an additional fare
levied on pullman passengers on the theory that
it costs more to haul people in a pullman car be-
cause it seats fewer passengers was eliminated
this reduced the actual pullman fare by 

   isolated instances showed that these cuts were
very successful on many runs especially in the
south  and  times the regular number of pas-
sengers was carried and actual income was more
than doubled nevertheless total  passenger
revenues of southern and western roads did not
exceed those of  in any such proportion
figures available at the time we went to press
showed that passenger revenues of the southern
lines increased about  and those of the west-
ern and mid-westem lines  what is more
those of the eastern roads which have not re-
duced fares increased about whereas total
passenger revenues in this country increased a lit-
tle less than  just what these figures indicate

is not easy to say for to interpret them fully
would necessitate some guesswork about what the
passenger revenues of the southern and western
roads would have been if they had not reduced
fares they have much more highway and air
competition to worry about than the eastern
roads and even if they had only broken even by
reducing fares we believe the experiment would
have been a success from many angles in 
they carried about twice the number of people
as they did in  and in this way created a
drift back to railroad passenger trains whose ef-
fect may prove to be far more valuable in the
long run than the rather small immediate increase
in passenger revenue certainly they lost nothing
but bad will-of which all railroads can afford to
lose plenty

ican railway engineering association area
has recommended this formula for the selec-
tion of elevation which it adopted in

working this out we find that on a  curve
the super-elevation of the outer rail ought to be

	in for traffic traveling  mph  in for
 mph and  in- for  mph on a io
curve it should be more than  in at  mph
while on a i curve it need be only  in at

by railroads when working out this formula is
considerably less than the highest speed of pas-
senger trains over the curves for the obvious
reason that even fast passenger trains are rarely
run around curves at maximum permissible speed
and that freight trains are operated very much
more slowly

  we dont believe there is a railroad in the

years ago no  right was probably the  james mckay baldwin-built in  as no
 and then renumbered the other no  was first  then  then  and finally 
she had  x -inch cylinders and -inch drivers

trains run  mph or more every day between
certain points such examples can be found on
almost every road thus the  speed limit  of
lines seems to have little to do with the actual
speed of many of their trains and although we
realize that it would be poor policy to do away
with all speed restrictions we feel that some
revision of them is necessary

how to

build a

by charles g
cunningham

-i

overhead and side views of hand car model described here

built a hand-car model with-
out spending a cent on material
the wood was picked up from
a lumber yard brass for the
wheels came from an old brass
bolt axles were made of old piano wire
some of you fellows who decide to build a
hand car may buy the exact material men-
tioned in this article although something
else would do just as well i used to buy
things too when i really didnt have to
then i got wise to myself now i create
models out of anything handy

  in making the hand car first get a piece
of hardwood maple if possible it should
be the kind of wood that has fine little
burls or knots in it one piece  x x
will supply all the wood you need for the
car itself a line should be scribed
marked about  in from a squared

edge cut this off
so it will give you a
slab of wood 
thick x yz wide
and the length of
your block this
will supply cross-
beams longitudinal members and upright
posts on top where the handles are placed

with the y wide face lying flat on the
table mark additional lines which will just
cover the top of the piece with  lines
take a piece of steel or a scale and cut out
the strips with a safety-razor blade dont
let the scale slip otherwise you would ruin

	pieces and your fingers

select  of the squarest pieces and cut
them off  mm long as measured by your
millimeter rule make sure the cut is on
all  faces this avoids splintering and
waste on each end shape a handle such
as you used to see on old-fashioned wood-
en wheelbarrows sand well lay aside

next you need  cross members using
the same  square material cut 
pieces each  mm long there is noth-
ing left to do with these except sand them

model
how to build a model hand car

finished model of hand car photo slightly enlarged

dont try to sand them
after they are in place as
this would only result in
breaking them note that
the cross members stick
out a little beyond the car
edges not more than y
mm at the most these
also are laid aside put all
finished parts in a small
box nothing is so hard
to find on the workshop
bench as a tiny piece of
wood

  make a small block 
mm square for holding the
bull gear on the under-
side this about finishes
the under parts made
of wood the floor or main frame is a
rectangular piece of maple  x  x  mm
in the middle of this floor cut a hole 
x  mm long be sure this is in the exact
center now make uprights for pump
handles bottom sills are  mm square
 mm long taper these  pieces on the
top edge as in the drawing when making
the uprights lay them on a piece of draw-
ing-paper and glue them together there
later cut away the paper this gives the
parts support while drying

 pump handles are made of match
sticks the frame is a piece of tin cut
as the drawing shows with a no  drill
hole in the lower part some model build-
ers are in too great a hurry to make wheels
they turn and drill more than one wheel
at a time that causes wobbly wheels

  when drilling holes for wheels which are

	mm in diameter use a no  drill
axles are no  drill rod or an equivalent
diameter in piano wire cut the drill rod
off  mm long solder wheels to axle on
back forming little fillets or flat molding

  the other pair of wheels is not put to-
gether until you have forced a gear wheel
onto the axle the bull gear is easily
made of a large size watch wheel in this
gear drill a hole the center of which will
come just about  mm from the bottom
of the gears teeth this hole is for the

crank pin the crank pin is a short piece
of no  drill rod not more than  mm
long solder a small piece of tin onto this
to hold the crank rod in place

  holders for axles are made of staple
from the stapling machine they are bent
into u form and forced into bottom of car

  to assemble first varnish the 
square sticks but not the floor using a
good grade of ambroid stick the cross-
beams on first the  end ones go right
in line with edge of floor the  middle
ones are in line with edges of center hole
after these have dried put longitudinal
beams in place outside beams are in line
with sides of car the  center beams also
are in line with the center hole that is

	mm from center of car floor center
of axles is  mm from ends of car

  use your own judgment in placing the
 mm square block so the bull gear will
line up with the one on the axle paint
all metal parts black connecting rod
from pump handles is formed like the one
in the drawing and made out of no 
drill rod rest of car is easy to assemble

a realistic model of a rotary snow plow

i built a mallet compound model easily
and cheaply using largely scrap ma-
terial the boiler was a piece of  pipe
turned to shape in a lathe cab tender
etc were made of  gage sheet steel
while cylinders domes and stacks were cast
of aluminum drive wheels were cast of
brass at a nearby foundry from patterns i
made of aluminum this cost  the larg-
est single item the whole job cost 

  the locomotive is   long  high
by  wide she runs on a track  wide
about a  scale she has a polarity relay
in the tank which reverses her by simply
reversing the track polarity at some point
in the system

  my first thought was that if i could make
the drive wheels i could easily do the rest
of course they could be purchased but i
preferred to build my own therefore i
made up a set of patterns of aluminum by
first turning out  discs on a lathe  in dia
these discs were flat on one side the other
side being tapered down from the center
until within  of the outer edge this
gave the correct shape for the rim the
finished pattern is w in thickness

  next place the surfaces of the discs to-
gether and dowel-pin so that the finished
pattern can be taken apart in  halves
mark out for the spokes counter-weights
and crank pin drill between the spokes
and work them out with a small file it is not
strenuous work as aluminum cuts easily
cut out the pieces and pin on to make the
hub and counter-weights stand out coun-
ter-weights must be fastened on so they
can be removed as different sized ones must
be used for main drivers etc all parts
must taper from the middle to the outside
of each half of the wheel so it will draw
out of the moulding sand readily

  i now had a set of drive wheel patterns
which any foundry could cast from my
wheels are made of tough brass and shrunk
on the steel tires

  next i made the frame as mallets have
a hinge in the frame it was necessary to
make it in  sections these sections differ
somewhat the front section carries the
low-pressure cylinders pilot beam coupler
and pony truck on the front end the back
section has the high-pressure cylinders on
the front end and the trailer on the rear
trailers are generally made as a separate
unit but i made this one rigid with the
main frame this method proves satisfac-
tory my frame is made the same as the
real ones and has journal boxes for the
drivers i took  v x  steel bar and
marked out the frames by drilling and
filing out the openings for the boxes and
spaces between a very rigid and real like-
ness frame can be made

  next came the cylinders they were cast
from aluminum aluminum is good for
model making it can be melted in most
any coal range or furnace when melted it
is easy to handle make any mould or form
from sheet and pour in the metal it is not
bad about leaking out and after cool peel
off the sheet iron and you have a very nice
casting domes and stack can be made in
like manner

  after the cylinders were mounted came
the boiler this was made from a piece of
 pipe turned to shape in the lathe on the
drum end and fitted with a sheet-iron back
end and firebox all sheet iron used was

	gage some may have difficulty in
working sheet metal so let me say that
sheet metal is placed between them and
clamped in a vise with a little practice
it is easy to flange bend stretch or work
the metal in most any form

  now mount the boiler after which one is
encouraged and can go on and elaborate
with the trimmings as desired-air reverse
gear air and feed-water pumps and injec-
tors by looking at some real ones it is
easy to see how they can be made for any
model the cab is made as before men-
tioned by shaping  gage metal over
forms tender steps and door are all made
likewise

  the model weighs  lbs this is not
all natural weight as i put lead in the
boiler to give it more traction she can
pull  or  cars carrying my  lb son
quite easily she is electric driven through
a d rail in the center of the track power
the model trading post



is supplied through worm gear to each set
of drivers a remodeled essex starting mo-
tor was used placed in the firebox the
gear ratio between motor armature and
drivers is  to  this gives plenty of
power the motor was reduced in size
about one-third this is quite a job but
i believe anyone handy with tools can do it

  i have quite a railroad in my back yard-
a tunnel a trestle and switches etc also
a gas-electric car for passenger service to-
gether with a wrecking crane a snow plow
and several types of cars

 i	will prepare the working drawings
of my locomotive with more complete de-
tails if i receive enough requests for them

ex-brakeman mop author of crossings etc

umber  streaked west-
ward through the desert
midnight forty reefers-
refrigerator cars - filled
with hams and beef and
bacon chased the roaring decapod
which led them on through the south-
west beneath the desert stars

  atop a reefer behind the cold bar-

  rejers to the number j driving wheels

  rage of beating cinders the redheaded
   brick  donley crouched against an
  upraised icebox cover no common
  hobo brick two hundred thousand
  miles he had ridden as brakeman on
  another line

   the whistle blew for monksburg
 brick left the shelter of his icebox
 cover climbed to the running board
 and peered ahead where green and yel-
 low switch lights twinkled through the
 darkness

	 r

it was a good luck
charm-but it was
as lucky as a sentence
of death
the silver cross



saw only a dark form evidently a
mexican a headblock light was
gleaming with a green switch light be-
low

   you mean this main line switch
  si yes firs one on the right
   gracias thanks  ill-

   have you the match to light the
cigaretto a hand was thrust out
toward him

  brick switched on his silver lighter

the engineer had come with the torch

in its light brick saw a trembling
right hand rising

   i wonder he muttered looking
around for detectives  if theres any
bulls in this cock-eyed burg to nab a
man the minute he hits the cinders

   there ees my frien

  the voice was beside him brick

started all night he had thought him-
self alone upon the reeling reefers his
unseen companion laughed continued
in the same soft voice

  u three bulls work here nights
eef you jump off queek by this first
green light you mees heem all

  brick donley glanced sidewise and

     	r

the mexican seized it in the right
hand held the cigarette in his left in
the instant that he lifted both hands
simultaneously to his lips brick
glimpsed the face above

  the face was intelligent yet hard
and cold as a bed of frozen lava the
mouth was set in a sinister smile eyes
were balls of black fire beginning
with the upper lid of the right a white


railroad stories

scar ran out to lose itself in shadows
at the temple brick was to remember
that scar in the months to come-
months already marked by the long
lean finger of fate

  he watched the man walk toward
the rear saw his shadow against the
distant markers as he swung from the
roof and disappeared

  a moment longer brick himself re-
mained on top the headblock light
came nearer he slipped down the end
ladder as the ground ran by under the
headlight of the yard goat coming
down the change cabooses then pick-
ing a spot he landed

  while twenty reefers passed the fur-
loughed brakeman debated whether to
spend the night in monksburg or be on
his way if he went on no  he
would be in tuscany by morning
from tuscany he could ride a freight
hitch hike or pay a fare and be in
phoenix by tomorrow night

  he left the right-of-way walked
rapidly toward the street lights which
marked the business district of the
desert terminal he found the all-night
restaurant

  two men were eating at the counter
two lanterns on the floor and a train-
book on a hip identified them as con-
ductor and brakeman on a freight

  the shack was slightly older than
brick his companion the conductor
was past middle age they were not
talking one glance told brick they
were not the talking kind

  the conductor did not look in his
direction the brakeman eyed him with
mild curiosity evidently placed him as
a  transient  and continued the meal
a platinum blonde brought a glass of
water and patted a superior foot while
he scanned the menu when he or-
dered she called out in singsong voice

   scramble a pair

  soon afterward the conductor left
without a word he flung coin and
check upon the counter fished a tooth-
pick from the glass and strode into the
darkness the brakeman swapped
wisecracks with the blonde then he
too went out leaving brick alone with
the waitress

  she turned on the radio outside a
cowboy was picking a guitar and sing-
ing   in a lon-lee grrave dug sixx bv
threee    the girl listened to half
the verse muttered a  damn and
turned off the radio

   make yuh homesick sister 
queried brick sympathetically

  she flashed a look of appreciation

 yeah makes me wish id had
sense enough to stay on the ranch in
texas where folks do their eatin in
daytime an save the night for square
dancin

after brick finished eating he
-hurried up the dimly lighted street
and turned right on the first crossing
the yards lay in darkness save for the
glow of fixed signals and the shifting
sparks of a few lanterns

  he stopped on the crossing to get his
bearings to the east the curving
figure of the roundhouse roof wras
etched against the stars to the west
marked by its platform light lay the
passenger station with the division
offices and the yards beyond

  this his railroad eye took in at a
single glance another glance showed
him a pair of markers burning red on
track  with a steaming engine on the
west end of the track

  not caring to risk encounter with
railroad police against whom the
mysterious mexican had warned him
brick hastily returned to the street
followed it west for eight blocks and
cut back into the yards
the silver cross



  ducking across the main lines he
came up between two coal cars on track
i it was dark he stopped to listen
came the familiar drip-drip-drip of
water from icebox drains on the
reefers they were on the next track
knowledge of railroads had guided
him to the train he had ridden in

  he thrust his red head cautiously
around the end of a car to reconnoiter
a dozen car-lengths to the west was a
lantern

  swellhead he thought  grabbin

seals

  he eased back between the cars to
listen presently he heard heavy foot-
steps rap-rap-rap-rap then a pause
while the conductor checked the num-
ber on a seal against the number in his
train book another rap-rap-rap-rap
another pause

  nearer came the sound brick was
listening listening for the stealthy
tread of a cinder dick he strained his
ears and eyes

  did he hear another step yvas
another man keeping step with the con-
ductor or was it an echo he could
not determine

  the sound ceased when the conduc-
tor stopped came again when he
moved

  brick would have liked to look out
he did not dare for against the light
of the conductors lantern his head
would show as clearly as the dome on
an oil tank

  the conductor stopped at the door
of the reefer to the west checked it
and started on brick heard cinders
rattle heard the heavy rap-rap-rap-rap
and like an echo the fainter tapping

  the furloughed shack wished he had

 	swellhead-conductor also called grabber
the brains o r c captain skipper big ox
king smart alec brainless wonder etc see slang
vocabulary in oct  railroad stories

remained on the other side of the car
a moment later he was glad he had not
done so

  on came the conductor the lantern
light was before him and behind he
passed the coupling within arms
reach he stopped at the reefer door
ahead lifted the lantern grasped the
seal read the number

  another figure glided by the red-
heads hiding place he was dressed
in black he crouched on all fours
lantern light flashed from metal
brick came erect the prowler ivas
drawing a gleaming dirk

  brick yelled   look out

  suddenly the dark figure stabbed at
the conductor brick leaped and struck
at the prowler

  the conductor whirled dropping his
book and pencil with a startled
 madre dios the would-be assassin
went down but before either brick or
the conductor had time to think he had
scrambled to his knees darted under
the train and disappeared

the conductor flashed his lantern
in bricks face  what the hells
this  he demanded

  brick shrugged  looks like the
seeds of a funeral tryin to sprout

   yeah the skipper fumbled with
a peculiar watch-charm dangling from
a gold chain it was a cross of silver
with a tiny line of jade running
through its arms

   things are sure cornin to a hel-
luva pass in this section of the coun-
try he rasped  railroad man has to
have a bodyguard to keep some thug
from stickin a knife in his neck

   things aint so nice for railroad-
ers brick agreed  i happen to be
one myself

  oh doyuh

  yeah brick went on names


railroad stories

donley i hold rights brakin and run-
nin on the st  sf out of weller
the conductor eyed him shrewdly
 when did the st  sf start run-
nin trains through monksburg

  brick chuckled  they didnt we
had a board cut up our way im
headin west for the vegetable sheds
the older man glanced at his watch
made a notation in the train book
then he said

  im pat omalley

   glad to know-

   the pacific omalley inter-
rupted  furnishes me with a caboose
to ride in unless youd rather ride the
top of a reefer-

   thanks mr omalley if theres
no danger of bulls and brass hats

   bulls and brass hats dont interest
themselves in my caboose or what i
carry in it if yuh want to ride come
on back

  pat omalley went toward his
caboose checking seals brick followed
silently he kept looking back an
eight-inch dirk in a skilled hand is a
strong magnet especially in a dark
trainyard at ioo am

  they entered the caboose by the
front door the first thing brick saw
was a ten-inch square of pine board
hanging shoulder high on the closed
rear door it was painted like a tar-
get and around the bullseye were tiny
slits

  the hind brakeman was on the
bunk he laid down his paper his
mouth was open

  wide blue eyes were question marks
growing bigger

  omalley jerked a thumb toward his
guest and introduced

   larkin this is donley he be-
longs with the st  sf outa wel-
ler hes ridin to tuscany

    brass hats-railroad officials

  larkins hand was outstretched in
brotherly greeting  glad to know
you donley

   the pleasures mutual brick
gripped the extended hand

  omalley ignored them he did not
mention the attack he trimmed his
lantern wick sharpened a pencil took
his train book and went up the blind
side of the train

then larkin said  i was won-
derin donley if you carry a
magic powder or somethin

   no-o-o it was bricks turn to
be puzzled  why 

   ive been on this car five years
the shack went on  youre the first
man thats ever been asked to ride the
caboose its got me guessin

  the redhead did not enlighten him
together they discussed the railroad
situation lamented the fact that  the
old railroad she aint what she used to
be

  larkin took a long knife from his
locker brick remembered that other
knife he had seen that night he won-
dered if there could be a connection
he decided not this open-faced fel-
low was not the kind to plan or execute
a murder

  the brakeman flipped the knife in
a quick underhand toss it arched
through the air and buried its point in
the target thirty feet away he
glanced around for approval

  youre pretty good said brick

   i ought to be i been practicin
for three years

   so

  yah larkin recovered the knife
and prepared for another throw  guy
has to kill time on these night runs
somehow

  brick said   yes he sure does
  larkin hurled the knife
the silver cross



brick thought about pat omalley reports were done pat came to join

something in the conductors demeanor
intrigued him maybe it was the utter
contempt for danger he caught him-
self wishing that instead of getting a
job at the lettuce sheds he might re-
main here to learn more of this strange
pair who rode together

  he went outside no  came no

them brick moved over omalley
laid a detaining hand on his knee

   just keep your seat boy ill set
right here with yuh

brick yelled  look outl

 whistled off larkin appeared on
the rear platform and swung a high-
ball the slack went out

  brick caught the rear he and lar-
kin rode the platform until pat having
locked the main line switch swung up
beside them the conductor went into
the caboose arranged blanks and car-
bon sheets and began work on reports

  brick and larkin climbed to the
cupola forty miles rolled eastward

  pat climbed upon the cushion loaded
the clay pipe larkin kept looking puz-
zled they rode in silence for many
miles pat knocked the ash from the
pipe

   so yuh goin to the salt river to
pack lettuce hungh he queried


railroad stories

   yeah gonna try it

   kind of a hard graft im told

    aint so hot but it beats nothin
 youve tried it before this was
the brakemans question

   yeah second season for me
larkin blew smoke rings yuh
know donley he said  if i was out
of a job i believe id rather do news-
butchin than lettuce packin ever
try it

   no-o-o never thought of it

   aint so bad gives a guy a place
to sleep an a bite to eat an some of
these runs make good money

   it is about as near railroadin as
anything a fellow can get into ad-
mitted brick who had a keen love for
the iron trail

   why dont yuh give it a whirl

    ill think it over said brick

   pat was playing with the silver cross
 why dont you he queried  the
fredrickson company has the conces-
sion on both the pacific and the p  a
their headquarters is in tuscany it
wont take you thirty minutes in the
mornin to find out about it

   pretty heavy bond required isnt
there the furloughed shack wanted to
know

   not much was the reply  twen-
ty dollars maybe if yuh happened to
need a little i might-

  thanks mr omalley if its no
more than that i guess i can manage

brick did not go to salt river
instead he went with pat to
mandy grogans boarding-house and
met  the gang  at breakfast besides
larkin and pat there were two brake-
men and a fireman there was orville
anderson trainmasters clerk and

 	a news butcher is a train vendor of maga-
 zines candy fruit etc

there was  dalena  to think about

  magdalena was pats nineteen-year-
old daughter brick wise to the south-
west knew she was not all irish that
jet hair framing a face of milky white-
ness those eyes glistening like desert
stars those features finely chiseled and
almost moorish surely came from
spanish blood

  mrs grogan seated them side by
side the coquettish hand she offered
at her fathers blunt introduction sent
a tingling to bricks toes he glanced
around quickly and caught jack lar-
kin watching them jack did not look
pleased

  after breakfast the redhead went
with pat to the fredrickson offices
harry stimson local manager of the
news butch outfit with a scant half-
dozen questions hired him on the con-
ductors recommendation

   you may report at  this after-
noon donley stimson instructed
 ill send you east on number twen-
ty-two you can double back on
twenty-one this will put you out
with two different men and give you
the hang of things after tonight
youll be on your own

  briefly the manager outlined their
system of checking merchandise gave
instructions as to reports and regula-
tions and wished him luck and a
pleasant good-morning

  brick was not certain he would like
this new job he had always shunned
the starch and polish of passenger serv-
ice preferring the rough and tumble
freedom of freight

  omalley persuaded him to room at
mrs grogans that lady was pats
sister she was a motherly widow-as
boarding-house keepers should be-
plump and on the sunny side of fifty
though pat did not mention magda-
lena mrs grogan soon did
the silver cross



  on the morning he came to pay his
rent the two lading were in the parlor
magdalena was at the piano she was
smartly dressed in black from her
ears dangled silver bobs whose design
was the swastika cross of silver lined
with jade

  the elder woman threw a significant
glance  perhaps mr donley she
said jokingly  i should warm ye agin
the wiles of me pretty niece

   im afraid mrs grogan brick
responded gallantly  your warning
comes too late

  dalena blushed  dont mind her
mr donley folks would think i was
a regular man-killer

  mrs grogan chuckled later
brick went to his room and to bed with
the feeling that pat omalley and his
sister were deliberately dangling the
girl before him a rank stranger he
wondered why

  shrewdly he surmised it was not be-
cause they wanted him in the family
but because they wanted to keep some-
one else out and that someone he
guessed was jack larkin for a while
he lay awake thinking about the matter
and his decision was

   if that cutie wants to play railroad
on my right-of-way she can have a
clear track an no slow orders

brick never mentioned the circum-
stances of his first meeting with
pat omalley and because folks specu-
lated about it he supposed pat had not
done so it was not long until he
wished he had

  at first he did not like the news
butch job he felt a trifle self-con-
scious as he went down the aisles call-
ing

   candy-chewing gum-peanuts
like an apple for the baby lady only
a nickel

  but the feel of rolling wheels was
compensation he was still railroad-
ing after a fashion soon he came to
feel the challenge of increased sales
the challenge of the hard customer who
sits in stony silence refusing to be sold
but more than all else he felt the keen
pleasure of coming home

  always when he came during the
day dalena omalley met him with a
smile and a simple greeting sometimes
she went with him to a picture show
as she went with orville anderson and
the two brakemen

  with larkin she never left the house
alone often brick would see them ex-
change meaning glances drift out
separately and after an interval return
by different doors where and how
they spent those intervals he never
knew

the man with the scar

 i ahree weeks after brick went to
work pat was called emergency to
handle no  the incoming crew
turned the train over to his men and
he and brick went into the smoker

  pat as conductor took the two front
seats on the right side for his office
brick as news butcher appropriated
the two across the aisle for his shop he
set his trunk between the seats and
spread his merchandise - candies
chewing gum fruits cigarettes tobac-
co magazines and a dozen paper-
backed books printed in spanish

  when the train started pat came in
through the front door and unlocked
the washrooms then he began taking
up tickets

  brick decided to work the train first
with candy nuts and gum he started


railroad stories

when pat was halfway through the for-
ward compartment of the smoker

  practically every seat in this com-
partment was filled with mexicans
most of them were peons from below
the border or native ranchers and herd-
ers some joked in their native tongue
as the redhead passed others ignored
him a few eyed his wares with long-
ing

  when he had almost overtaken the
conductor he saw a man of different
type dressed in black broadcloth worn
but neatly pressed keen eyes darted
over the coach the lean face was
alert

  pat stopped at the seat ahead of him
the stranger jerked his head to the
left on the right side of the face was
a white-edged scar running down from
the eyelid brick tried to recall that
scar it was certainly familiar

  then he remembered it was the
scar-and the face-he had seen atop
the reefer the night an unknown mexi-
can had told him how to get by the
three bulls in the monksburg yard

  brick smiled in recognition his
smile quickly disappeared the mexi-
can was looking at pat omalleys
broad bosom those keen eyes were
fixed on the silver cross in them was
a look of deadly menace

  pat punched a pass and called
 tickets please the scarred one
thrust his pasteboard toward the con-
ductor quickly turned to stare from
the window

  under pretense of having forgotten
something brick returned to his
spread when he came back the mexi-
can was looking away

  two things more brick noted-the
right hand gripping the seat arm was
slim and white and on its fifth finger
was a ring whose emblem was a silver
cross a swastika cross inlaid with jade

  except for size it was an exact rep-
lica of the cross which pat omalley
was wearing for a charm-the cross at
which the scarred man had been look-
ing-and the two crosses which
adorned the lovely ears of pat omal-
leys daughter

  brick remained behind pat until he
had worked the smoker

  as the conductor started into the
chair car the news butch called  mr
omalley

  well omalley pivoted

   mr omalley did you notice that
mex up ahead the one with the scar
on his face 

   did i notice him

  something in pats tone made brick
feel like a man who has opened the
neighbors back door without knocking
and caught the neighbor kissing the
cook

 yes he looked as if hed like to
stick a knife in youf gizzard and-
brick hushed pat was toying with
the silver cross he did not look at
brick

   donley he said curtly  youve
done a right good job keepin your
mouth shut and tendin to your own
damn business since youve been here
dont spoil it

pat went into the chair car and
punched tickets brick went down
the aisle calling  chewing gum pea-
nuts salted peanuts candy nice
fresh chocolates

  he worked the pullmans and came
back pat was in the rear of the chair
car pat did not look up in the
smoker scarface was toying with the
ring he followed brick up the aisle

  brick felt a tickling at his spine he
remembered a night when a man had
stalked pat omalley

  the fellow looked over his spread
the silver cross



and inquired civilly  have you the
books of spanish

brick quit being a detective and be-
came a business man

yes-yes sir

he picked up the stock of books the
customer selected one from the center

  el diablo y el toreadorhe read
aloud

   the devil and the bull-fighter
translated brick

   you spik the spanish yes

   nope not much

   ees one beaut-tiful language
senor

  brick did not deny it the customer
bought the volume and returned to his
seat

  agua frio is sixty miles east of tus-
cany it is a water tank a pump shed
housing an old locomotive boiler and
a dwelling made by setting two box
cars like an l its sole inhabitant was

juan baca an old mexican pumper

  brick did not know it then but the
names of juan baca and the man with
the scar were written on the same page
of the book of fate

  the porter came through the train
calling agua frio agua frio
the man with the scar closed his book
taking up his check the porter said
again  agua frio sir

  brick was curious passengers sel-
dom left or boarded the train at this
desert station he followed pat the
man with the scar and the porter to
the platform pat opened the vestibule
the porter set a stool on the grade
the passenger stepped over the stool
and disappeared in the shadows

on the fifth finger of his right hand was a ring with a
silver cross
railroad stories

aawo days later came a row at the
grogan boarding-house what hap-
pened brick donley never positively
knew pat was two hundred pounds of
frozen fury mrs grogan was a cy-
clone magdalena was a flood

  one result was that jack larkin
moved to another boarding-place brick
saw little of him from that time on

  as soon as jack had gone brick
noticed a change in the girls demeanor
she seldom smiled she would sit by
the hour playing softly on the piano
playing things which fill the heart with
sadness

  brick longed to comfort her in the
lovers way he restrained his impulse

  pat too seemed worried he had
been morose before now he acted as
if he had turned at bay against a world
of enemies

  once in the twilight brick came
into the parlor father and daughter
were together she wore the silver ear-
rings whose ornaments were swastika
crosses lined with jade pat was toy-
ing with one of them

  brick heard her ask  when are you
going to tell me the story of these trin-
kets daddy

   some day dollie said pat

   youve been promising to tell me
 some day  ever since i can remem-
ber dalenas rich voice was petulant

   im going to maybe i ought-

  brick cleared his throat and started
out dalena sprang up and followed
him he had noticed of late that she
clung to him almost like a shadow
they went to the picture show together
that night

 and the next night-

etween pass city and tuscany
the tracks of the pacific and the
p  a roughly parallel each other
in places they are miles apart in

others they are so close together that
rival enginemen can shake hands from
cab windows

  heading east from tuscany the
pacific crosses the p  a and swings
north into the sand hills the rival
lines approach each other again at
agua frio each has a water tank
there but their tracks are two hundred
yards apart a mile east of agua
frio however they swing in close and
run side by side for forty of the sixty
miles into monksburg

  jack larkin was still braking behind
for pat omalley they were called
for an orange train east out of tuscany
at  brick had gone to pass city
the previous night on no  he left
pass city that night on no  at 

  at monksburg conductor rader of
no  came into the coach he was
pawing the air

   of all the nut-headed stunts i ever
heard of he raved  this is the limit
 whats happened now  brick
picked up a basket of fruit

   read that will yuh  the conduc-
tor thrust a piece of white tissue to-
ward the news butch who read

   order number  to c  e num-
  ber  at monksburg number  eng
   take siding meet exa  east
  at bannister

   puttin us in the hole for a freight
huh brick commented

   putting us in the hole for a damned
orange drag stormed the conductor
if that doesnt beat hell men work
a lifetime getting seniority to run a
train thats got some rights and then
get sidetracked for   

  brick chuckled he went down the
aisle calling oranges apples nice
juicy   

  the limited took siding at bannis-
ter twenty-nine miles west of monks-
the silver cross



burg five minutes after they had
cleared a light showed over the grade
far to the west the crew aired their
grievance on the cinders while waiting
for their meet with pat omalleys
orange train brick followed them

  they stalked along the tracks the
light divided became two lights side by
side

   do they run engines with twin
headlights on this pike queried
brick

   naw thats a drag on the p 
a rader answered sourly  prob-
ably another orange train racing with
our man i hope they beat him

  the earth trembled the porter
went to open the switch headlights
drew nearer the pacific train was a
dozen car-lengths in the lead brick
and the conductor took refuge between
the smoker and chair car

  past them zoomed the engine
reefers rocked and reeled rader was
on the platform brick was on the top
step

  the marker came on brick straight-
ened peered toward the cupola it was
empty he peered at the oblongs which
were windows opened his mouth to let
out a greeting yell

  as the window went by he glimpsed
something-something which froze the
unuttered cry in his throat

  it was only a blurred flash but one
which would remain with him to his
dying day

  over the desk where night after
night pat omalley sat to make out
reports he saw a hand descending in
the hand was a knife-a gleaming
knife

  brick heard conductor rader gasp
felt a hand grip his shoulder

   did-did you see that screamed
the conductor

   yeah i saw it

   what do juh make of it 

   murder

  rader hit the cinders he was
swinging a washout stop sign but
either the engineer on the  did not
see the signal or reckoned it was not
meant for him and the orange train
roared on

rader reported to monksburg
monksburg organized a posse
the posse flagged the extra a mile from
the yard limit and searched it car
lights were focussed on both sides so
no one could leave it

  in the caboose they found jack lar-
kin his nerve shattered the late pat-
rick omalley was lying in a pool of
clotted blood

  a bull laid a heavy hand on larkins
shaking shoulder  what do you know
about this deal brakie

  larkin gasped

   i-i dont know anything

   where was you when it hap-
pened 

   i went out to look about a hot box
on the train cornin up bellevue i
didnt get back to the caboose till a few
minutes ago he was-like you see
him surely you dont think i-

   hold him ordered the chief
 well see what else we can round up
they rounded up nothing no one
was on the train but the crew and the
rest of them had been on the engine
they found jacks knife in the caboose
they found his target

  say bellowed the chief aint
this our knife-throwin brakeman

   sure

   hes the bird were lookin for
 yeah him an omalleys been at
outs for months

they held larkin for the inquest
brick did not doubt but that the mur-
derer was the man whose attack he had


railroad stories

forestalled weeks ago he never
dreamed of their accusing larkin

  at  they reached tuscany brick
looked after his trunk and went to gro-
gans neighbors were whispering he
ignored their whisperings magdalena
and mrs grogan were leaving for
monksburg by auto knowing that
jack larkin was there the news butch-
er did not even consider going with
them

  he went to bed after two hours of
fitful sleep he got up and drifted over
to the yard office orville anderson
the trainmasters clerk and rader
were talking he heard the conductor
say  thats sure hell about jack lar-
kin isnt it

  brick thought jack larkin did
he get jack too

anderson said  im not surprised
rader retorted  i sure am i never
would have thought it of the kid hes
always seemed kind of harmless and
there was dalena-

   that was it the clerk interrupted
 pat and jack have been having merry
hell over dalena jacks been making
love to her and old pat thought she
was too young to marry

   sure looks bad for the boy

   hell sit in the hot seat for it
  that ended the conversation

brick confronted rader  whats
this i hear about larkin he
queried

   they think larkin killed omal-
ley

   why theyre nuts gasped brick
 larkin never no more done that
than-

   maybe you know who did  sug-
gested anderson

   yeah maybe you could see-

   i couldnt see any more than you
did rader not as much because you

was higher an had a better view of the
inside of that caboose but-

   know something you havent told
donley rader asked searchingly
youre damn right i do

  no  was due out porter and con-
ductor were calling their  bo-oa-ard
brick darted into the fredrickson
office the manager looked up in sur-
prise

  what is it donley

  brick explained briefly

   its that omalley case mr stim-
son ive got to go to monksburg on
number twelve

  brick darted to the platform and
caught the observation he knew little
of legal technicalities he assumed
that when he told what he knew the
law would release larkin and begin
search for the murderer he began
taking lessons shortly

  in monksburg the inquest was set
for  he tried to see jack larkin

   busy the deputy informed him
curtly  cant be disturbed

  the deputy did not tell brick that
nine men were grilling larkin in the
sweat chamber trying to wring a con-
fession from him before the inquest
the news butcher returned at 
only to be met with the same reply

  he went to the hotel magdalena
and mrs grogan had come into the
lobby at sight of brick the daughter
burst out sobbing

 dont take it so hard little girl
he laid a sympathetic arm about her
shoulder  you cant do him any
good its something we all must-
jack didnt do it she blubbered
 of course he didnt earnestly
the sobbing ceased  dont you
think so

   i most certainly dont

   everybody else seems to she re-
torted spitefully
the silver cross



  mrs grogan laid a hand on mag-
dalenas arm  the taxis here dar-
ling lets go

the coroners inquest

trick went to the inquest the
coroners office was crowded and
the proceedings were under way the
district attorney was there

  witnesses were called facts were
established patrick langley omalley
a pacific railway conductor had died
suddenly in his caboose between the
hours of  pm and  am
death was due to a wound from a knife
or other sharp instrument

  brick kept wondering how he could
get into the inquest about the time
they recalled larkin he sought a
deputy

   i know something in this case he
asserted

   name please

   b f donley i was news agent
on number seventeen last night i
saw-

  oh yes just a moment

  the deputy talked to the coroner
the coroner talked to the prosecutor
the prosecutor nodded the deputy
came back to brick

   all right mr donley well use
you when we finish with the next wit-
ness

  larkin told about going on the train
to look for hot boxes he told how he
had returned to the caboose and found
pat a knife was produced it was
clean and cold and razor sharp

   is this the knife which killed him
sir  queried the district attorney

   no-i-that is i dont know
stammered the flustered brakeman

   isnt this your knife mr larkin
  yes sir

   where was it when you ah re-
turned to the caboose 

   it was-i didnt see it i had it in
the locker

  jack had gone entirely to pieces he
looked as if he had been sick for a
month

   isnt it a fact mr larkin that
you have been carrying this knife on
your caboose

   ive been-been practicing with it
   practicing

  yes sir you know throwing

   how long

   about three years

   pretty good at throiving arent
you

  yes sir

   did you throw it at the deceased or
stab him with it

   i-i-didnt do it

   thats all

  jack returned to his seat the
prosecutor smiled knowingly and
called mr b f donley

   mr donley  answered questions
his age his occupation had he
known the deceased  how long  had
he known mr larkin how long

  evidently the prosecutor was little
interested in bricks testimony  you
may now tell us what you know con-
cerning the death of the deceased

briefly brick described what he
had seen through the caboose win-
dow as the orange train had passed no
 in siding at bannister

   i dont think he continued  that
mr larkin had anything to do-

   please confine your testimony to
facts mr donley the inquest is not
interested in your opinion

   well- brick scarcely knew
whether to go on or quit  about two


railroad stories

months ago i rode a freight train into
monksburg and intended to ride it

out-

   does this ride have any bearing
on the case

   it might have a lot bricks red-
hot temper was flaming  i was wait
in to catch a freight out and omalley
came by grabbin seals another man
was behind him the other man had a
knife he jumped on pat and tried to
stab him with it i knocked him down
he got up and got away i believe-
a spectator cackled another
croaked  horsefeathers

  the prosecutor twiddled his thumbs
 is that all mr donley

  yes sir except that-

   why did you not bring this to
light sooner

   mr omalley did not mention it
i thought-

   thats all witness excused
brick was furious he knew his tes-
timony had been inadequate contempt
and unbelief beat back from scowling
faces the jury the coroner the crowd
thought he had framed a lie to try to
clear larkin

  so he was not surprised when the
verdict came  the deceased patrick
langley omalley met his death as a
result of a wound inflicted by a knife
or other sharp instrument in the hands
of a person assumed to be john jacob
larkin

  on the strength of this finding jack
was held for murder deputies hustled
him to the sweat chamber under the
stone courthouse brick tried to see
him but was not admitted

the inquest was held on a satur-
day afternoon brick returned to
tuscany he desired to talk with mag-
dalena before taking action

  funeral service had been set for

monday knowing that he could do
nothing on sunday the news butcher
worked that night and the next he
returned to tuscany on no  and
gave mr rader details of the first at-
tack upon omalley

  the conductor listened skeptically
the press played up the circumstantial
evidence in the minds of the public
larkin stood convicted rader had
read the papers

  trials are expensive if a case can
be cinched with a confession it saves
money and it strengthens official
reputations

  an hour after jack was arrested the
officers convinced he was guilty
 turned on the heat from early
saturday morning until the hour of
the inquest nine of them questioned
him in relays

  one would stand at either hand one
behind him they would shake grisly
reminders under his eyes-his knife
pats bloody jumper magdalenas pic-
ture they would thunder questions in
terrifying tones trying to break his
nerve

  they told him that they knew hed
done it and the best thing for him was
full confession it would make things
easier if only he would tell the truth
then they would wheedle poor little
magdalena waiting at home for a
daddy who would never return

   we know you did it son why
dont you come clean and give us the
details so we can end the ordeal 

  jack wept sweated swore they
took him to the inquest he talked to
no one they returned him to his cell
throughout saturday night and sun-
day their questioning continued

  sunday night at midnight jiey left
him alone the floor was hard the
cell was a dungeon jack had only one
blanket between him and concrete he
the silver cross



tossed restlessly until the morning

  his tormenters came again all
through the day they put clever ques-
tions promising food and quiet  just
as soon as you tell the truth

rs grogan was in the parlor
when brick came in from the
funeral

   its ashamed av ye i am mr don-
ley she raved  here ayve been
th inkin ye was me friend an ye
turrn right around an go hellupin out
that fiend which murdered me poor
brither in cauld blood

   but jack didnt kill him

   no he didnt chimed in magda-
lena

 there ye gao the baoth of ye
traitors to yer aown flish and blude
 were not traitors magdalena
said stoutly  didnt you hear what
brick told the inquest

    yis an av all the patched-up false-
hoods-

   it wasnt a falsehood denied
brick  its the gods truth thats
why pat brought me here to tuscany
and got me a job

   jack and i wondered about that
the girl remarked

   i think said brick  it has some-
thing to do with the silver cross he
wore-

  magdalena threw her hands to her
head  the silver cross say-

  she hurriedly opened her fathers
grip it contained the articles taken
from his body his wallet with the
five-dollar bill and the two ones with
lodge receipt and passes his pocket
knife the pencil and its holder his
watch and chain

  she lifted the watch and let the chain
dangle the silver cross was gone

  brick and magdalena went to
monksburg jack could  not be seen

they hired james p warren a widely
known lawyer

  warren went to the courthouse
brick and magdalena went with him
they met the district attorney his
face was beaming

   so youre taking the larkin case
eh warren he chortled

  warren nodded gravely

    well youre a little late getting to
your man hes just signed a confes-
sion and everythings fixed

  two days later warren said to
brick donley  when i took the case
i was convinced larkin was guilty
after talking with him i am now con-
vinced he is innocent it will be hard
to prove that forced confession will
be difficult to get by a jury

  whats your program brick in-
quired

  the lawyer scratched his chin

   i dont know we have much to
overcome first is their contention that
the only person not accounted for on
the train is larkin we can refute
that if we can prove that a supposed
murderer could have left it while in
motion

   thats one thing which puzzles
me said brick

  if we refute that argument we
weaken their case if we establish a
connection between that missing cross
and a motive for murder we weaken it
still more if we find the man with the
ring and he has the cross on him that
would about clear larkin unless we
can- warren shrugged significantly

   the electric chair

   such things have happened my
dear donley

brick returned disconsolately to
magdalena and told her what
warren had said declared he was go-
ing to do all he could


railroad stories

   i want to help you she asserted
 all right theres things id like
to know if my questions become too
personal-

   nothing is too personal brick
with jacks life at stake

   you love him-that much

   yes i-i love him the black
eyes filled

  brick laid a hand on the trembling
arm just how strong was the
trouble between him and-and pat

   i dont know daddy objected to
my going with him said i was too
young to marry told me jack was not
ready to settle down yet he and
auntie tried to break up our engage-
ment i dont think either of them dis-
liked jack particularly except that we
went right on in spite of them

  brick nodded  your mother was
spanish wasnt she

   mexican the girl answered
proudly

   what was her maiden name

   i dont know daddy used to rail-
road in mexico magdalena explained
 they met while he was there he
came here after she died

   do you know where he worked 
   no

   does your aunt 

   i doubt it daddy was out of
touch with all of them for years before
she came to tuscany to keep house for
him

   is there anyone here who knew him
while he was down there

   not so far as i know

   do you know anything about the
silver cross

  the girl shook her head  nothing
 you have a pair of ear-rings of the
same design havent you 

  yes you wish to see them

   no do you know anything of
their history

   only that they belonged to my
mother

  brick ran slim fingers through his
red pompadour  do you suppose that
cross could have belonged to a set of
which the ear-rings were a part
dalena thought a moment

   it might have theyre being of
the same design would indicate it

   might there not have been four
pieces to the set  say a sort of locket
two ear ornaments and a finger ring
 we have no ring

   i saw one recently said brick
  did you where

   a mexican-an upper-class mexi-
can id say-was wearing it

   thats strange

   yes and the strangest thing about
it is that he was in monksburg the
night of the first attempt on your
fathers life and also in agua frio less
than four days before-before-

   you think-

   im certain of it the news butcher
insisted if we could contact your
fathers past i believe we could un-
cover something which might help
larkin

jacks trial was set for september
it was now nearing the end of
july brick went to agua frio to see
old juan baca the pumper juan
came out of the l-shaped shanty brick
did not talk much spanish juan did
not talk much english

  they conversed brokenly    the
desert the weather the pumping
plant there was a closed door at the
end of the shanty brick kept wonder-
ing what was behind it every time he
moved toward it old juan skillfully
steered him away

  juan showed him the ancient loco-
motive boiler which made steam for the
plant brick thought if the water
the silver cross



ever gets low on the crown sheet of
that pile of junk its going to send a
mex and a water tank to kingdom
come

  using english spanish and two
hands brick asked  who was the man
with the scar who got off number
twenty-one here a few nights ago

   scar-scar-

   si-si scar brick drew a
finger from his eye to his forehead

  the pumpers eyes were perfectly
blank he professed total inability
to understand what the news butcher
was saying

  no sabe scar no sabet

  noon came the pumper did not
eat brick sat on the bench beside the
closed door he could hear move-
ments inside the squeak of a stealthy
foot moving over boards finally he
pointed to the door and demanded
sternly what was inside

  juan answered readily

   mis perros dos perros muy
males my two dogs very bad
dogs bite the old man snapped
toothless jaws and grinned

  brick saw a long peculiar ridge
under the waistband of his overalls
such a ridge as a concealed knife might
make he considered either brazenly
opening that door or forcing the
pumper to do so

  he did neither he had come here
to scout he had no weapon if the
murderer were there it would mean
trouble two men two dogs two
knives against a pair of bare hands
suicide

a freight came from the west
brick caught the caboose he
waved farewell to the pumper and
started toward monksburg

  he did not go far at bellevue he
left the train and called attorney war-

ren he asked the lawyer to send offi-
cers with a search warrant he caught
the first train west and unloaded at the
arroyo beyond the tank he wraited
here until the officers came

  he was away two hours the offi-
cers came at  they were not
energetic in their search brick urged
them on they asked juan to open the
door where the dogs were he did it
willingly but with the air of injured
innocence

  the room was eight by twelve feet
it contained two vicious black mon-
grels and an old wooden bunk with
four army blankets the only sus-
picious article they found was a worn
broadcloth coat though it was many
sizes too large for him old juan
claimed it as his

  the officers apologized profusely
they glowered at brick

   as a detective one sneered  you
make a right good news butcher

  crestfallen and sore brick returned
to tuscany whether his man had
been in the shanty he did not know
if so his own bungling had permitted
the fellow to escape and now thor-
oughly on his guard would be difficult
to locate

magdalena continued to

worry over jack larkin every
day she grew thinner and her dark
eyes had a haunted look noticing it
mrs grogan complained to brick

   me niece is grievin hersel to
death aover the man that murdered her
fayther

   mr larkin didnt do it protested
the news butcher loyally

   yere a funny guy mr donley
said mrs grogan  here ye are heels

self an still wurrukin yer head aoff

folks are funny things

   dont mrs grogan please
ay wont mrs grogan was
chuckling shrewdly now  maybe
yere not so funny afther all mr don-
ley if ye keep tryin to the end an
thin fail why the yang lady-

  brick had thought of that it only
made him the more determined to do
something anything he tried to
figure some way of tracing pats life
below the border he sent inquiries to
railway offices he found no trace of
a man named omalley who fitted
pats description had omalley been
there under a flag if so what flag

  he tried to figure how a man could
have left that orange train at fifty
miles an hour with assurance of safety
it seemed impossible then-

he was on no  they
stopped at agua frio tank
the p  a tank was two hundred
yards north of it a fruit train on
the p  a was pulling out he heard
the engineer give two ringing blasts of
his whistle it sounded like a chal-
lenge

  the porter chuckled  we all guine
have some fun this mawnin butch
yeah how so

   at p  a guy say he wanna run
a race wid bat higgins an ouah streak
uh varnish

   hes sure talkin to the right man
brick saw the p  a hogger thumb
his nose bat was oiling around bat
shouted something to the fireman the
fireman quit on two thirds of a tank
bat called in his flag and by the way
the ground rocked under that iron
horse brick knew the race was on

  he worked the coaches keeping an
eye out for the fun when they went
through bellevue no  was doing

sixty the p  a orange train was
throwing sparks to the sky while
smoke from rival stacks obscured the
sun

  passengers had come alive to the
fact that a race was on they crowded
to the south side of the train watching
bat higgins with high wheels and
fourteen coaches overhauled the
p  a mike with forty reefers inch
by inch he dragged his coaches past
the careening caboose

  brick was on the observation plat-
form when they went by the rear end
of the freight caboose the two trains
were running at almost equal pace
the platform was crowded brick
stopped to take in the show

  the hind man on the orange drag
was a short chubby fellow wearing a
bill cap hind part before he had a
smudge of grease on each cheek and
another over the forehead he was
putting on a clown act

  he blew the whistle and danced and
cavorted and shook his fist at the flag-
man on the limited finally in mock
rage he stood on the cross timber of
the caboose and swung to the platform
of the observation

  breathless the crowd gasped the
change was made at sixty miles an
hour the clown joshed the ogling
girls and when the limited passed his
forward platform he swung neatly
back thumbed his nose at the pacific
flagman and disappeared

  brick hurried back through the
coaches he was calling excitedly
newspapers magazines books
but he was thinking of something else
that clown of a brakeman climbing
from one train to the other had given
him an idea

   funny i never thought about it be-
fore he was thinking  damn
funny why ive jumped em lots of
the silver cross



times at fifteen or twenty if a fellow
can make em at fifteen why not at
fifty

  he wired warren to meet him at
monksburg station the attorney did
so but looked a trifle bored as he
strolled out on the platform

   say cried brick  ive found
how our guy got off that train that
night

   what guy  what train 

   the guy that killed pat omalley

  it was the lawyers turn to be ex-
cited now whats that he
seized bricks arm  wha-

   yes sir its easy as pie for
thirty miles along there this p  a
an the pacific runs side by side there
was two orange trains that night one
on each track they was racin i re-
member it the pacific man was in
the lead a man could do it without
a hitch

   do what

   switch from one train to the other
dont yuh see it was like this

  brick indicated with his hands
two trains are runnin side by side
here the murderer strikes darts out
the door of pats caboose an hops over
to a ladder on the p  a drag they
dont find him on the train where he
done the job because he aint on that
train

   he was rollin into monksburg
on the p  a an laughin up his
sleeve to think how slick hed fooled

brick worked back into tuscany
arriving at ioo am one
sxnall bulb was lit in the grogan parlor

magdalena eyes burning like desert
stars was waiting for him

   i thought youd never come
brick she chattered

  why-why- the redhead
stopped it took all his will power to
resist the temptation to take her into
his arms to tell her how he loved her
 whats up little girl he asked in a
husky tone

  nothing only-only- well-
she laughed foolishly  after i went
to bed i had a hunch you know
theres a town in sonora called magda-
lena i wondered-

if you were named for the town
 yes and not only that i won-
dered if daddy used to work there or
met my mother there she paused
wistfully for his answer

  brick considered  there might
be something to it kid he said

   will you go down there dalena
suggested  you might learn  
brick did some quick thinking he
had less than fifty dollars warren
had required most of jacks balance to
cover fees and expenses of trial mag-
dalena may have read his mind

  if its money she faltered  i
might-be able to help out i have a
few hundred it wont-be worth
much to me if-if-

  brick nodded understanding he
knew the girl was shuddering at the
thought of her lover in the electric
chair

  the trial was now a scant two weeks
away whatever was done must be
done quickly brick reported off duty
he caught a train to the border and
rode south to magdalena

  magdalena is an ancient city of five
thousand population it serves a terri-
tory rich in legend and in agricultural
products for generations it has been
the trading center for mighty


railroad stories

haciendas ranches where live the
brave caballeros with their peons and
their cattle

  entering the town brick put up at
the hotel off the plaza and scouted
around he met an old boomer brake-
man now running a shop a fellow
named elbert sales to whom he told
his mission

  sales agreed to help together they
inquired of elderly natives and ameri-
cans of long residence whether anyone
had ever known pat omalley a rail-
road conductor running through mag-
dalena nobody recalled him

  brick had brought along one of
magdalenas ear-rings he flashed it
on old-timers he asked questions and
read faces for his answer but at the
end of a week he knew exactly nothing

  on his last day in magdalena while
sauntering past the mission of san
francisco xavier he encountered a
beggar she was an ancient crone
ragged disreputable consumed by dis-
ease she hobbled on a cane pointing
to her wrecked and ruined condition

  brick fished a silver peso from his
pocket she extended the palsied hand
he dropped the coin as the hand
closed over it he observed about her
neck three greasy leathern thongs at-
tached to two of them were bits of
filthy rag which carried tokens for the
warding off of evil attached to the
third was a familiar-looking silver
cross

  instantly brick came alive the
pobre muttered her gracias senor
may the mother of god be kind to
you

  brick studied the cross it was not a
crucifix it was a swastika except
that it was not lined with jade it might
have been the one he was seeking

  he fumbled for another peso the
pobre stopped avaricious eyes ap-

praised him  here he thought
 may be the one he did not pass
over the coin he shrewdly held it be-
tween thumb and finger

  the old hag smiled encouragingly
brick began talking in the best spanish
he could muster

   did you know an american named
pat omalley

  no she didnt

   did you know a man with a scar
on his face like this indicating the
imaginary cut in the eyelid and down
the face was impassive

   have you ever seen a thing like
this he flashed magdalenas ear-
ring

  at sight of it the dull eyes gleamed
trembling hands stretched out eagerly
trying to take it from him the pit-
eous voice broke into a startled cry

   bst la cruz de la plata madre de
dios bst la santa crus it is the
silver cross mother of god it is
the holy cross

  brick dropped the coin into the grop-
ing palm  whose  he asked eagerly
in spanish whose

  instantly agitation was gone the
face became an expressionless mask
the beggar whined fingered the silver
peso muttered dully  no sabe
senor no sabe

  brick knew he had stumbled into
something he was certain not only
that this beggar knew the cross but
that it held significance until night
he pleaded with her he thrust a hand-
ful of bills under her nose he sent
mr sales to her but the only answer
either of them could get was i do
not know

the trial opened with a bitter
legal fight as to whether jacks
 confession  should be admitted the
court ruled it should be even though
the silver cross



the prisoner claimed it had been forced
from him by  third degree  methods

  then examination of witnesses be-
gan jack thin pale calm took a
place beside his attorney

  the prosecutor established the fact
and manner of death and built up a
line of evidence hard to beat

  the accused had been with the body
his knife had been in the caboose he
was an expert with the instrument
there had been ill feeling between him
and the victim the train had been
running at a rate of speed which pre-
cluded the possibility of any person
having left it between the time of the
murder and its search by the posse

  finally the purported confession
was read it was signed in jacks own
hand asked if larkin had written it
one of the officers presenting it de-
clared it had been deduced from state-
ments made during the period of ques-
tioning and signed by the defendant
with a confident smile the prosecution
rested

  mr james p warren was clever
he could not go into intimate details
of the purported confession because the
men who obtained it were not on trial
this  confession  had been obtained
at the end of sixty-seven hours of in-
tensive  questioning  by the police

  that fact meant little to men who
had never been thus  questioned
they could not understand how an in-
nocent man could swear away his life
just to keep from being  questioned
furthermore in the selection of the
jury every juryman who had been
 accused of crime  had been chal-
lenged by the prosecution so that not
a juryman had a chance of having been
 questioned

  the jury was skeptical they
nudged each other and smiled their
smiles of unbelief

  warren shifted to other lines of at-
tack he brought out the fact that for
many miles before and after the mur-
der the train had been running side by
side with another train he produced
experienced trainmen who declared
that the transfer from one train to the
other would have been quite possible

  he next sought to discredit the
validity of evidence established by the
prosecution the defendant claimed
to have been out of the caboose at the
time of the murder inspecting a hot
box warren proved by yard em-
ployees in monksburg that there had
been a hot box on the orange eight
ahead of the caboose and that it had
been  doctored

  warren next proved there was an
unlimited number of knives which
might have been used in the crime and
in monksburg alone were many men
who could have done the deed

  from there he switched to the mat-
ter of motive despite vicious objection
from the prosecution and established
the fact that a silver cross of peculiar
design had been missing from the de-
ceaseds effects when the body had
been stripped and that this cross had
not as yet been recovered

f i hen brick was put on the stand
in an effort to prove that at least
one previous attempt had been made
upon pat omalleys life by a person
other than the accused

  from the moment he began his testi-
mony he met with a storm of protest
from the prosecution at every ques-
tion put by his attorney the opposition
was on his feet thundering his  i ob-
ject your honor on the ground   
three times the jury was sent from
the room while the judge decided
whether this bit of evidence or that
should be admitted


railroad stories

  in the end only the barest facts were
brought out no theories no deduc-
tions no reference to the mexican who
wore the ring to match the missing
cross the effect of this testimony was
greatly weakened by the fact that he
could not positively swear that the first
attacker was not larkin and the
further one that he had never men-
tioned the attack until after larkins
arrest

  even depositions as to brick don-
leys honesty and integrity from old
hell bender president of the st 
sf railway and peace officers in
weller failed to offset these facts

  the case went to the jury late mon-
day afternoon jack knew he was in a
tight spot so did his friends as he
was led back to his cell magdalena
lovely in black silk eyes glistening with
unshed tears flashed a message of en-
couragement he smiled bravely-and
was gone

  brick remained with magdalena he
knew she needed him as never before
in the twilight they left the city and
walked together out into the desert
where giant sahuaras stood with plead-
ing arms outstretched to heaven

  he held her hands and in the light
of the desert moon looked into the
tear-filled eyes where love was burning
he turned away in agony aware that
love like hers was not for him

  the following morning the jury re-
turned its sealed verdict jack was
taken to a crowded courtroom to hear
it brick brought magdalena

  it was an occasion which for three
of those present would never be for-
gotten the dingy courtroom the
solemn black-robed judge the whis-
pering crowds growing still the calm
voice reading  we the jury john
jacob larkin verdict guilty

  breathless agony as jack his face a

mask of ashen pallor rose unsteadily
to receive the sentence the solemn
voice of the judge pronouncing sen-
tence 

   on the second day of november
in the electric chairmay god
have mercy on your souli

  magdalena reeling from her chair
screaming  you cant do that hes
innocent hes- the heavy arm of
the law hustled her away

back in tuscany brick kept think-
ing about the expression on the
face of the old beggar in magdalena
mexico to whom he had shown that
cross he was convinced he had been
near the solution of the mystery but
he couldnt think of anything to do
about it now

  when he reported for duty stimson
was none too cordial

  are you through sleuthing the
manager asked shortly

   yes sir i reckon so

   well you better be said stimson
 the pacific officials raised merry hell
about your nosing into this omalley
murder case

   but mr stimson the news
butcher protested  im convinced
larkins innocent

   listen donley everybody ex-
cept that hysterical girl of omalleys
knows he did it shes so goofy over
larkin she cant even think straight
and now get down to business im not
going to use you on the pacific again
stick around a few days and ill get
you on the p  a but if youll take
a bit of advice from this time on
youll peddle merchandise for the fred-
rickson people and let bulls and flat-
feet nose out criminals

  brick did not argue there were
reasons why he should remain in tus-
cany he could not leave dalena in
the silver cross



her crisis she clung to him now as to a
brother

  then there was the chance that
something might come to light he
kept a lookout for the man with the
scar and the swastika ring and even
hired a private detective to help

  on the job he formed the habit of
watching agua
frio whenever he
went through he
could see from the
p  a tank the
pacific pumping
plant two hundred
yards away more
than once he won-
dered if his man
might be there in
hiding once so
strong was his
hunch that he re-
ported off duty
and watched the
plant all night

his vigil was re-
warded only by
the barking of
restless dogs

 three of the five
weeks between
death and jack
larkin went by

brick and magdalena went to visit him
when the doomed man told her good-
by the third time he asked her not to
come again two weeks from the day
of execution brick went alone

   i want you to be good to her don-
ley jack told him  ive never known
a man the prisoner broke down
for just a moment

   brace up old boy said brick
 were still trying-

   dont try to kid me donley you
cant help me nobody can help me
the cards are stacked against me he

choked stopped continued  before
i go i aim to do some-some stackin
myself

  brick looked up  what-

   if she knew id killed her old man
shed hate me wouldnt she

   but you didnt

  wouldnt she jack persisted

 wouldnt she
hate me if she
knew that

  there was a
mute plea in the
prisoners eyes a
plea and a cunning
gleam the signif-
i c a n c e of the
statement seeped
through bricks
consciousness

   i-dont know
jack he faltered
 dont be a fool
while theres life
theres hope
dont do anything
to block us in
case we should
uncover some-
thing at the last
moment

  jack laughed
harshly

   when the last deal comes donley
i aim to strip the deck-for-for her

later in a calm talk while motor-
ing with magdalena the news
butcher said  the only way we can
do anything for jack is to prove that
somebody wanted that cross badly
enough to commit murder for it not
only that but produce the person

  the highway circles both tanks a i
agua frio keeping to the hills above
when on their return they came out
on the height overlooking the tanks

e s dellinger author of  the silver
cross and the adobe shack near albu-
querque n m in which he wrote this
story


railroad stories

brick drove off to the side of the road
and stared moodily down upon them

   there -he waved his hand in the
direction of the pacific layout- is the
key to our mystery

  magdalena followed his pointing fin-
ger the autumn sun was painting the
top of the tank with gold and crimson
its shafts were playing on the wizened
figure beside the shanty door at his
feet a pair of mongrel dogs were lying

   you know brick she said slowly
 ive another idea it may fall flat
but-

  what is it little woman

  we think somebody wanted that
cross

   yes

  if he wanted the cross maybe he
wanted the ear-rings too

  yes brick wondered what she
was thinking

   if he did- dont you see if he
did and if he knew where they were
maybe he might try to get them
brick saw the possibility magda-
lenas idea was to use the ear-rings as
bait to lure the murderer from hiding

   it wont cost us anything to try
she urged

   it might cost you a lot if it suc-
ceeds brick objected  if that bird
comes for them he may come with a
lifted dagger

   what matter  she laughed bitter-
ly  what will anything matter after
a few more days

  they drove home magdalena put
on a silk mantilla fastened the orna-
ments in her ears and paraded down
the streets wherever she went people
turned to stare wise ones tapped their
foreheads gossips whispered

   has the girl gone mad  has she
no respect for the memory of her
father has she no respect for the
lover doomed to die

she spent that night and the next
day in tuscany the following
evening she went with brick to no-
gales they crossed the border to the
night club where revelry was in sway

  the second day they drove to agua
frio brazenly they paced the cinders
where juan baca could not help but
see them brick watched the watery
eyes a flicker crossed them when they
saw the ornaments of jade and silver
just a flicker and it was gone

  the third day they determined to
widen the scope of their baiting they
would go to the town of magdalena

  into the car they climbed drove
down the highway with mountains tow-
ering to right and left into the city
peons eyed them dully

  they lunched in the hotel off the
plaza they walked the streets loiter-
ing past the federal building and the
old mission they met the beggar in
her rags the three rawhide thongs
were still dangling from her neck they
dropped a peso in the outstretched
palm and watched the eyes which stud-
ied the silver crosses yet pretended not
to see all in vain

  back into tuscany hoping flaunt-
ing waiting brick felt uneasiness and
despair the hours drew on he fol-
lowed the girl like a shadow when-
ever she went down the streets he was
at her heels

  on the evening of the third day be-
fore the execution magdalenas hopes
took another tumble

   were not getting anywhere she
faltered  theres something wrong
maybe its your following me if only
youd keep away-

   and let them strike you down 

   its my request as a friend you
will not fail me please its our only
chance go out on your run leave
me alone until after   she stopped
the silver cross



  then ill hire a shadow

  no leave me alone i can take
care of myself if i cant-

  brick quit arguing and went for a
last visit with jack larkin instead of
the usual friendly greeting jack met
him with an unexpected sneer

   so you came did you donley 

   sure brick was puzzled

   i thought maybe youd got wised
up by this time

   wised up

  yes wised up read that an
quit bein a bigger fool than the lord
intended

  jack glanced furtively about thrust
a paper through the bars brick un-
folded it the writing was clear and
bold and stated

  to the bulls that caught me

  it would be too damn bad to kick off
  and leave you boys wondering whether
  youd croaked the wrong man you
  didnt my confession was ok i
  killed pat omalley he had the goods
  on me for another job nobody knew
  it but him i made love to his daugh-
  ter as a blind i waited too long it
  was me that donley almost caught that
  night in monksburg i slipped back to
  the caboose and changed clothes before
  they got there

  dont worry about that silver cross
  there are lots of them you might find
  that one if you dig long enough in
  meddlers arroyo west of monksburg
  thats where i dumped it dear little
  maggie put the idea in my head when
  she wondered what might be the story
  of that cross so long world

signed jack larkin

brick was dumfounded he stared
jack was rocking to and fro
on the balls of his feet he gave a hol-
low laugh  had yuh fooled all right
didnt i donley

  brick gasped  you-dont mean
for me to believe-

   what the hell else do you think i
mean you sap

   but the fellow i saw that night was

mexican the news butcher protested
 he talked the lingo-

    i talk the lingo better than the mex
himself listen

  jack reeled off a dozen sentences
his  madre dios was an almost per-
fect imitation of the exclamation brick
had heard that night in the monksburg
yard

  the guard was coming jack
snatched the paper slipped it into his
bosom

   from here on donley larkin
was almost sneering  youd better
confine yourself to peddlin peanuts
an let somebody that knows how do
the detective work

  utterly dazed brick turned to walk
away point by point he went over
jacks statement it seemed plausible
to the last detail it could have hap-
pened exactly that way then some-
thing caused him to turn and peer down
the corridor

  jack larkins head had gone down
his step lagged the guard was al-
most carrying him bricks eyelids
fluttered his throat became full

   almost fooled me jack old boy
he said huskily  ill let you go out
believin you did

at the end of the trail

twice that afternoon magdalena
saw a black-clad stranger loiter-
ing along the street she could not see
his face she followed he disap-
peared

  that night she went out-alone she
looked in crowds for the man with the
scar but did not see him magdalena
went up on the viaduct over the pa-
cific railway yards she leaned over
z

railroad stories

the railing to watch switch crews sort
box cars no  the pacific meat
pulled in

  when she looked again a stranger
was between her and the stairway up
which she had come she sauntered
toward him he was looking down in
the yards

  she cleared her throat the man did
not turn dalena passed within arms
reach he was wearing a black suit and
patent leather shoes she thought the
suit was broadcloth

  she idled down the steps the yards
were dark the man did not follow
magdalena filtered through the yards
and out into the unlighted streets
strange men whistled drunks jostled
her finally she went home feeling
a terrible premonition of evil

  it was nearly midnight the hall
was dark magdalena could not recall
when that light had failed to burn she
wondered if the bulb were gone she
opened the screen crossed the porch
slipped into the dark hall

  the girl fumbled for the light
switch she was thinking about the
bulb came a sound behind her she
screamed she had not intended to
do so

  frenzied arms closed about her neck
frenzied hands clutched twin shafts
of pain shot through her ears

  she caught the clutching hand a
light flicked on at the head of the stairs
a heavy ring was on the hand she
clung to it startled voices shouted
steps stumbled on the stairs

  her attacker was wiry with a star-
tled  madre dios he flung her from
him made for the door pats daugh-
ter was up and fighting like a tigress
in the dim light she saw a scar on the
right side of the face-a scar which be-
gan at the eyelid

  he flung open the door leaped from

the porch fled into the darkness mag-
dalena was stumbling from the porch
when hands caught her she was
screaming

   get him for gods sake dont let
him run away its the man the
man who killed

  as she struggled toward the open
door mrs grogan in flannel nightie a
trainmasters clerk in pink pajamas
and a brakeman supported her they
were chorusing did he hurt you
where did he go

  and then they saw the girls ears
they were dripping with blood the
ornaments were gone torn off mag-
dalena sat down to lament

   i had my chance oh god i
had my chance and muffed it

  they wrangled her to her room 
aroused neighbors came and hunted
for the thief one reckoned

   maybe that news butch was right
maybe somebody else killed pat omal-
ley maybe somebody ought to take
it up and try to stop that execution
another guessed  its just a trick
a trick hatched up between omalleys
girl and that guy donley to get jack
larkin free

  an hour passed they gave up the
chase and returned to bed or to specu
late

the pacific pumping plant at agua
frio had quit operating all day
repair men had worked on it they
had finished after dark the tank was
empty juan baca knew he would have
to keep his engine running nearly all
night to supply it

  at  his boiler had plenty of
water he put in a fire and took a
little nap at  he loaded his
grates he still had plenty of water
he took another little nap

  this nap was almost too long it
the silver cross



was after ioo when he awoke no
 had whistled for the station he
jumped up and looked at his gage
steam was down his fire was low
so was his water

  the old-timer put in a fire he in-
tended to fill the boiler when the fire
was done he did not fill it

  no  stopped at the tank the fire-
man pulled down the spout juan went
outside to watch soon the tank was
full the pacific meat pulled out juan
went back into his boiler room a step
sounded on the gravel a low voice
spoke excitedly in spanish juan
whirled there stood-the man with
the scar

   don diego cried juan

  don diego ramirez came stumbling
into the room his hat was gone his
hair was tousled his face looked as
if a tigress had attacked him his col-
lar was torn off his coat was ripped

   i have them at last he was cry-
ing in spanish  praise be to the
blessed saints i have them all oh
such happiness

  juan forgot his boiler habits and
lessons of a quarter century were for-
gotten he hurried to the shanty don
diego ramirez was at his heels

  the old man lit the coal oil lamp
don diego fished in deep pockets he
found a silver cross a pair of orna-
ments for the ears and laid them on
the table beside them he dropped the
ring removed from his finger

   las cruces santas he exulted

  both men stooped low examining
them they fondled their treasure and
gloated over it a train whistled for
the tank on the p  a stopped filled
and called in a flag

  juan lifted watery eyes they were
wide with terror

   mother of god he whispered  i
forgot--i forgot

  he hurried toward the boiler room
don diego followed he looked at
the water glass no water was in
sight

  juan hesitated he recalled what had
happened to other men who had for-
gotten to put water in a boiler-and
had remembered slowly he backed
from the room slowly he re-entered
not in more than twenty years had he
forgotten now-

  like a sleep walker he approached
the boiler gingerly he felt out the in-
jector he was praying  holy vir-
gin  let me not be too late let there
be water

  but the virgins ears were sealed
the injector caught cold water met
hot metal juan burst from the boiler
room hands over his head he stum-
bled into don diego shrieking

   back my lord back 

  his voice was drowned in a terrific
roar the earth seemed to rise the
buildings to fall and darkness closed

brick left pass city on the
 golden gleam he came
through monksburg at  no 
on the pacific lines left thirty minutes
ahead of him he disliked midnight
runs there was little business be-
cause most of the passengers were
sleeping

  he kept thinking about jack larkin
he debated whether he should try to
see his friend again might it not be
better to let things stand as jack had
left them maybe jack would wish it
thus

  he thought about magdalena how
would she take her lovers confession 
would she accept it would she re-
nounce her love for jack and turn to
him

  that brought another thought
when his love for her had seemed


railroad stories

hopeless he had longed for her he
had thought he could not live without
her now he recalled with misgiving
that his own life was set in boomer
trails could he forsake that life and
tie himself to a woman

  once there had been another his
heart had all but forgotten her was
love of a woman to be in his life only a
passing thing

  the  golden gleam  stopped for
its drink at agua frio as usual brick
climbed down from the smoker to
the south he could see the smear of red
which was the spur track switch on the
pacific he could see the oblong glow
from the shack window

  came another glow the door of
the shack burst open one shadow
darted from it another quickly fol-
lowed he could hear the distant ex-
haust as the ancient boiler forced water
up into the pacific tank

  his engineer called in the flagman
conductor and porter came into the
smoker brick followed them up the
steps he watched the porter close the
vestibule

 the engine coughed the train
moved outward toward the desert
gloomily he stared southward toward
the receding lights of the pacific tank

   the key to it all he thought

  there came a flash of light followed
by the dull roar of an explosion

  brick stared on toward the pacific
plant the red light the glow from
the window were blotted out a cloud
seemed suddenly to have arisen where
the tank had been

  muttering  what the hell  he burst
into the smoker the conductor was
not in sight brick grabbed a flashlight
and darted back to the vestibule

  he jerked the whistle cord in a stop
signal he flung open the trap he
swung to the ground from the moving

train and sprinted toward the pacific
plant two hundred yards away

  over sand banks raced the news
butcher tearing through patches of
mesquite and manzanita before he
reached the plant he knew it was not
there it had been wiped out

  brick remembered the ancient boiler
and smelled hot steam he saw a cloud
of it rising to the heavens obviously
there had been an explosion

d efore reaching the scene he re-
alized another thing pacific no
 was almost due he stumbled into
the pile debris from the wrecked tank
was piled head high upon the tracks
if no  should plow into that-

  brick flashed his light over it he
could see nothing for the white fog
then he called he heard no answer-
ing shout

  no  was now whistling he
turned away and sprinted up the track
to meet her the headlight plowed
around the curve brick swung his
flashlight

  the whistle  answered the train
stopped her engineer came down de-
manding what was wrong

  the tank brick shouted the
boiler exploded the tanks gone
down

  while the engineer was getting his
torch brick dashed back the white
cloud was still climbing to the heavens
many thousand gallons of water had
spread out over track and right-of-way

  in the track the redhead heard a
muffled groan he plunged through the
fog he expected to find old juan
baca but juan baca was not there

  the twisted broken heap of drenched
and tattered broadcloth held the man
he had been searching for-the mex-
ican who carried the scar and wore the
ring there was no mistaking it the
the silver cross



scar was visible beneath the grime of
blackened water

  the mouth was not set now in sin-
ister smile from the lips a crimson
froth was flying and in a dying gasp
they whispered in the native tongue

   the holy crosses ah woe is me
the silver crosses came too late-too
late

  brick heard the muttering he
tensed his mind repeated   the holy
crosses-came too late

  the hoghead had come with the
torch in its flickering light brick
could see a wobbling right hand rising
rising toward the froth-specked lips
he seized the hand and pried open the
stiffened fingers

  those fingers clutched in the grip of
death-a ring a silver cross a pair of
ear-rings set with jade

   my god brick recognized the
ear-rings and clutched the dying shoul-
der  did you kill her he shrieked
you murdering devil answer me
did you kill magdalena

  the blace eyes glazing fixed upon
him they stared and recognition
came and with recognition the mock-
ing smile

  magdalena no-no i do not
keel mees magdalena i cannot keel
dolores daughter i-only-

  a fit of coughing shook the form
and fresh froth thickened pacific men
were now upon the scene

  what is it brick conductor
rader asked  who-

  its him croaked brick the
man who killed omalley see the cross
he stole and magdalenas ear-rings
hes got them tonight

by this time old juan baca had
come jabbering prayers and
curses he had been only stunned at
sight of don diego he threw himself

beside the dying one sobbing and mut-
tering in his native tongue

  brick seized him not too gently

   do you know this hombret

   oh si the pumper quavered  i
know heem he ees one great caballero
he is don diego-

  the dying man lifted a finger he
signed for juan to come nearer his
voice sank brick watching breath-
lessly feared each word might be the
last he wanted a full confession be-
fore life fled

  don diego drew the old mans head
down close the others listening could
scarcely hear the whisper

   dijelos mi amigo dijelos la ver-
dad tell them my friend tell
them the truth

  the head fell back on donleys
shoulder and breathing ceased they
carried him from out the track and laid
him down old juan stood over him
pausing from time to time to sob and
moan juan switching back and forth
between his own tongue and the eng-
lish revealed the story

enturies ago old don diego
ramirez had done a favor for die
king of spain felipe had presented
to diegos wife  thees trinkets that
you see the king had blessed them
they were to bring peace and plenty
to his faithful subjects

  for many generations the family
had prospered on their hacienda in
sonora  beeg rancho-many horses
-many vacas-muchos ships for the
wool-muchos happy people ah but
that was one great hacienda there i
was born i taught the young diego
how to ride and how to throw thees
knife

  then young diego had been smitten
of a city girl in magdalena  she was
ver-ver beautiful thees senorita do-

it happened in real life

ellingers story  the silver cross tells about a con-
ductor being murdered aboard his train some fiction critics
unfamiliar with railroad history will grunt baloney such things
never happen in real life dont be too sure here is an incident
which actually occurred fifty years ago on a cuttingly oold night
in february 

    the texas plains were frosted with powdery snow but con-
ductor fraziers train on the international  great northern mis-
souri pacific heading toward galveston was cheery inside as it
pulled out from overton the colored porter davis-a dapper fellow with sideburns and
spanish mustachios looked up and down the train for tramps he saw two men climb
on the blind end of the baggage car up front tramps were daviss business he banged
the door shut marched up through the coach and the baggage car and opened its front
door with a key he had in his pocket for just that purpose the train had not yet picked
up much speed

    git off he commanded the men whirled and faced him they had on masks
and each carried two six-guns four guns were entirely too many for davis who sud-
denly retreated slamming the door but hed had a glimpse of the two faces

    a car or so down he met frazier and panted theys two tramps on the front of
the baggage car suh i told em to git off suh but they got guns

    frazier was too good-natured to put anybody off on the open plains on such a night
 ill bring them into the smoking car and drop them off at the next station he said
 this weather is terrible

    he and brakeman powers went through the baggage car and opened the blind door
the bandits expecting an attack instantly opened fire frazier fell dead powers was
wounded he banged the door and staggered back into the car the gunmen then
leaped off into the thin snow

    the murder was reported to general manager hoxie at st
louis hoxie sent detectives to overton and ordered a special
train up from marshall carrying a pack of bloodhounds which had
been lent by the texas and pacific the dogs were in charge of
a man named mundoon who had great faith in them

    aroused men of overton had already-at dawn-picked up the
snow trail of the fugitives and followed it to that town where it mingled with others
and was lost eager among the searching posse was john price the town blacksmith
a hard-boiled hombre but a staunch citizen when the bloodhounds showed up yapping
and baying he snorted with contempt  youll never get anywhere with those

    nevertheless the hounds set up a bellowing and started off-to the picket
fence around prices shack thats a good one roared price the crowd
hooted and jeered at the dogs mundoon patiently led them back to where theyd
started and the animals picked up a second trail-to the home of john knight
prices brother-in-law

    a few hours later davis in disguise stepped from a train wearing a battered
hat seedy trousers and frayed shirt he looked like a farm hand out of work the
porter had parted with his precious sideburns and mustaches in order to go to overton
and identify the suspects he quickly pointed out price who was shoeing a horse and
knight-still a member of the hunt party

    price tough guy was gingerly arrested toward the close of his trial when it
appeared that nobody dared convict him a tall texan ambled up to one of the railroad
detectives and said i was afraid price would be put in jail now that hes goin to be
let out i mean to kill the rat he shot my brother i just wanted you-all to know
a few mornings later price came out on his back porch to wash in a tin basin an un-
known man crawled out from under the porch raised a six-gun and shot him through
the head no one was convicted-jim holden

ever it is a poor sample
of british locomotive

better-voiced affairs al-
though most of them
are soprano or contralto
but why not as all loco-
motives are  shes  

  u s and canadian criticism reached british
ears and both l m s and l n e r have
decided to use bigger and deeper-toned whistles
the former road reverted to the famous drum-
mond  hooter a single-chambered instrument of
 chime-whistle  type formerly used for the en-
gines of its constituent railway the caledonian
of scotland all new l m s power is being
equipped with this mellow tenor-noted instru-
ment

  l n e r have just built a new pattern of
express loco a streamlined mikado type called
 cock o the north  class these are the first
l n e r engines equipped with the new whis-
tles which are genuine triple-chambered chimes
similar to the american pattern

  the caledonian ry was the pioneer of the
chime-whistle in the british isles about  years
back somebody had the big idea of fixing up a
distinctive whistle on the roads pet high-wheeler
the famous   cardean  -- type that
used to haul the  royal scots  predecessor on
the caledonian section of her run so they im-
ported an american-made triple-chime for  
and she kept it until the end of her career in

  as an ex-sergeant th ry engineers a e f
i have an interesting souvenir in the form of a
book of rules used on the leading french rail-
roads the etat p l m and p o during the
world war this book printed in both english
and french was issued to soldiers engaged in rail-
way service here are excerpts from it

   on all trains handled by american enginemen
the conductor will be a french railway employee

  trains must not be started at a station or at
any other point between stations until tne condr
gives a signal which is one blast of the horn the
absence of a signal indicates the track is clear

   a pocket whistle is used by station masters or
by their representatives to give to condrs of trains
the departure signal one long whistle

   a horn is used by condrs at the head end of
trains to give the departure signal to enginemen

   a bell on the tender of the engine is connected
by a cord to the caboose at the head end occupied
by the condr one stroke on the bell orders an
immediate stop stop signal also can be given by
several sharp blasts of the pocket whistle or of a
horn

  outfit for-train and engine men enginemen
must always have red flag red disc bordered by
a white circle lantern with red lenses torpedoes
box of matches trainmen must always have
red flag one lantern with white and green and
red lenses box torpedoes box of matches

   p l m ry-in switching at stations the
direction of movement is based on the position of
the smokestack of the engine with respect to the
engineman the smokestack precedes the engine-
man in all forward movements and follows him in
all backing movements-irvinc e adams

the new million-dollar streamline car

the so-called  million-dollar car one of which was recently placed in operation
on the b-mt surface lines in new york city embodies principles and equipment
developed by or for the engineering staff of the electric railway presidents conference
committee it is intended to provide the operating performance which the committees
investigations indicated as necessary in a modern rail vehicle approximately a million
dollars was spent in developing the new car requirements to be met were

     	motor and control equipment which would provide a degree of agility compar-
able to that of modern automobiles and which would permit high acceleration rates to
be achieved so smoothly as to avoid discomfort to standing passengers

    	braking equipment which would permit high schedule speeds to be obtained
with adequate safety in congested traffic

     	simplicity in the operation of control and brakes which would enable the oper-
ator to handle his car smoothly and with confidence while utilizing its full performance
ability

     	elimination of noise and disagreeable vibration

     	body structures having maximum strength and rigidity consistent with mini-
mum weight and construction cost

     	attractive exterior and interior body design combined with modern seating
illumination heating and ventilation

     the purpose was to obtain an urban rail vehicle capable of holding its own against
automobiles and busses in the contest for public favor and patronage it was built by
the pullman car  mfg corp which made somewhat similar streamline cars for the
surface lines of chicago cleveland and other big cities

     the chicago car weighs  pounds and is approximately  per cent lighter than
those in use today upholstered seats are provided for  passengers an improved
ventilating system gives fresh air in all seasons cooled in summer and heated in winter
indirect lighting of high intensity is furnished by a ceiling trough four -horse-
power -volt high-speed motors provide ample power for a quick pickup

     braking is done by a combination of air devices using the motors to generate elec-
tric current and also braking by magnetic shoes sliding on the rails these systems are
controlled automatically by a device known as a retardation controller the brakes

                        ihotos from pullman car it mfg corp chicago and li-mt corp n  city

two examples of the new  million-dollar  streamline car no  above is running in
chicago the  is operated by the brooklyn-manhattan transit corp in brooklyn n y

are equipped to maintain uniformly any desired rate of braking up to a maximum of
 miles per hour per second

    automatic acceleration is attained by a new type of controller which steps the car
up after the power is applied at rates varying from lz to  miles per hour per sec-
ond according to the speed required by traffic conditions an acceleration and braking
rate of nearly twice that of the standard car now in use is possible because automatic
control assures smoothness in operation

    the exterior of the car is striking in appearance it has graceful lines in keeping
with the modern trend toward streamlining and is finished in a light royal blue color
combined with aluminum and black striping the interior finish is of sheet aluminum
including the ceiling which is of special arched shape meeting in the center with a duct
for circulation of air
how engine builders
make photos

by paul t warner

former editor  baldwin locomotives  magazine

photos jrom the author and locomotive photograph co
box  w market st sta philadelphia pa

last collectors of locomotive photo-
graphs have reason to cheer up for
the past few years new engines have
been few and far between and even
now prospects are not too bright but
a number of locomotives of unusual
interest are on order or being built the northern
pacific lackawanna nickel plate lehigh valley
pittsburgh  west virginia and boston  maine
axe some of the roads which have recently received
or shortly will receive new power

  the most realistic kind of a locomotive picture
is one showing the engine on the road hauling a
train but in such a picture many of the construc-
tive details are necessarily lost to any one in-
terested in locomotive design a side view of the
engine while standing is more satisfactory

  the builder generally takes such a photograph
before the engine leaves the shop if the order
covers a number of duplicate locomotives only one
engine preferably the first to be completed is pho-
tographed if the design is unusual a series of
photographs is taken including the right and left
sides the front and rear of both the locomotive
and tender and other special views

  when a number of duplicate locomotives are
under construction a photograph showing the com-
pleted cab interior of the first engine helps in lo-
cating the fittings on the succeeding locomotives
it is rarely that drawings are made showing the
exact location of all the cab equipment thus the
photograph is usually the only record which shows
the cab fittings as actually applied

  to obtain a really satisfactory photograph of a
locomotive quite a bit of preparation is necessary
the engine should be painted in a flat color with-
out varnish in order to avoid light reflections this
is a special job which must be entirely washed off
before the locomotive is finally painted for service
a good effect is obtained by painting the edges of
the tires a light gray as the wheels then stand out
similar paint is often used on parts of the frames

                                         
	railroad stories

close-up of the running gear on np no  note the  boxpok  or spokeless driving
wheels and the light paint on wheel tires throat sheet and reciprocating parts

or spring rigging which would be entirely
lost in the picture if left a dead black

  the modern american locomotive is usu-
ally painted a dead black with little if any
striping gone are the days of red wheels
 wine-colored  tanks indians on head
lights landscapes on cab panels and brass
boiler bands occasionally a special color
scheme is called for as in the case of the
famous  president  locomotives on the
baltimore  ohio which were olive green
with gold and maroon striping and gold
lettering

  foreign customers sometimes ask for
special schemes with elaborate monograms
showing the initial letters of the road or
even chinese or japanese characters which
must be exact copies of patterns furnished
by the purchaser

  the illustrations show the photographer
busy on one of the huge -- type loco-
motives for the northern pacific recently
built at the eddystone plant of the bald-
win locomotive works there is a large
yard outside the erecting shop with plenty
of track room so that the locomotive can
easily be placed in a favorable location

  armed with my small camera i was
present at the time the locomotive was
moved out of the shop and spotted at vari-
ous locations in the yard by one of the
baldwin switchers the entire job includ-

ed photographing the right and left sides
taking angle views of the front special
views of the locomotive and tender looking
down from above views of the interior of
the cab and of the firebox the last one be-
ing made by flash light the following
sizes of film were used in taking these pic-
tures

  for the left-hand side or  regular
view exposures were made on jx
 x  and  x  film respectively
the prints made from the  x 
film are trimmed down to about x
inches and this is the size most generally
used the  x  size is for reproduc-
tion while the  x  prints are usually
for framing

  the right-hand side of the locomotive
was photographed on the  x  and
 x  sizes while all the other views
were made m the  x  size only

  while the majority of the locomotives
built today are of standard  j gage
it is frequently necessary especially for
foreign roads to build to other gages the
most common being one metre  
one of the tracks leading out of the eddy-
stone erecting shop is laid with five rails
spaced so that locomotives of almost any
gage can be run outside

  an important detail in finishing a nega-
tive is to paint out the background with
international engine picture club



opaque so that the locomotive will stand
out prominently in the finished print this
requires not only a steady hand but also
a knowledge of the construction of the en-
gine otherwise certain parts will be blocked
out that should be left in the picture

  a photo like everything else is of little
value if you dont know where to locate it
hence the locomotive builder maintains a
complete system of filing negatives and
prints if for any reason a single locomo-
tive or a group of locomotives leaves the

plant without being photographed the sub-
sequent need for a picture is almost sure to
arise a few dollars spent on photography
may later prove a true economy

  the steam locomotive is not yet obso-
lete nor will it be for a long long time
but it has reached a high point in its de-
velopment and now is a good time to work
up a photograph collection you can take
them yourself you can exchange or buy
them from others collecting engine pic-
tures is americas fastest growing hobby

international engine picture club

suggestions for members living in larger
cities why not occasionally organize a
sunday excursion on some railroad which
is offering a special rate that week-end for
example last november tli thirty members
of the railway  locomotive historical so-
cietys n y chapter and several members of
our club went down to halethorpe md where
the baltimore  ohio has kept on exhibition its
old-time engines cars etc which it displayed
at the  fair of the iron horse  in 
through the efforts of t t taber our fellow-
member and chairman of the historical so-
cietys n y chapter the b  o reserved a
special coach for the party and arranged to stop
the train at halethorpe although everyone was
traveling on a n y-washlngton excursion
ticket which cost less  than the usual
one-way fare it was the first time that any
such trip has been taken out of new york city
by railroad enthusiasts but judging from the
turnout it will not be the last what is more
it can be done elsewhere if enough people get
together on the idea
