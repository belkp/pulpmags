  even rome with all her sunlit posses-
sions must have this wild hercynian
swamp as well and its history like most
european history begins with caesar

these nether lands were partly german and

partly celtic in race in the extreme north
between the rhine and the eras were the
frisians a teutonic race -famed even
among their indomitable neighbors for
their instinct for freedom

tavians another shade of teutons no less
stubborn and independent after their
conquest by caesar these batavians-who
blended with the frisians made the modem
dutch-became one of the firmest allies of
rome cresars regard for their fighting
qualities was such that  the batavian
legion  was his favorite body of
troops and till the times of vespasian
it remained the imperial body-guard

  one may recall in parenthesis that
the south african boers are the direct
descendants of these sturdy batavians

so durable are racial characteristics
and so early in the history of a race
is its destiny foreshadowed-a re-
mark which applies no less to the
third race inhabiting the remaining
portion of the nether lands the
belgae proper

  these were mainly celtic in stock
- bravest of all the celts- caesar
declared them they were of the
same race as the gauls and shared
their brilliant qualities while add-
ing something of teutonic fiber

from their intermarriage with frankish
settlers from beyond ihe rhine the
descendants of the belgae are to-day called
walloons and make about three-eighths of
the population of belgium living almost
exclusively in the basin of the meuse and
speaking a language which is basic-
ally french the other five-eighths
are flemings confined to the basin
of the scheldt their language being
basically german

modern belgium therefore pre-
sents the singularity of a nation
composed of two essentially different
races speaking two distinct tongues
mutually incomprehensible french
is for the most part the govern-
mental and  polite  language but
their religion the roman catholic
is probably the strongest cement of
their political union

 the boundary between the
walloon and flemish languages
according to one authority  is a
fairly straight line from vise
southward past brussels and
courtrai to calais though wal-
loon is spoken in a few isolated
districts to the north and flemish
is spoken here and there to the
south of the line

by taking toll of the industry of the work-
ing population

  with all their combative instincts the
people of the netherlands united an un-
common capacity for hard work great skill
in handicrafts and rare commercial energy
the nobles were quick to see that the

encouragement of this commercial spirit
meant a steady revenue and the workers
on their part soon realized that in the
necessity of the nobles lay their opportuni-
ty thus in exchange for various financial
contributions in the form of tolls and taxes
they bought certain rights and privileges
as the towns grew up and prospered they
were able by providing funds for the cam-
paigns or crusades of their overlords and

like services to win for themselves those
charters of incorporation which made them
 free cities established on this footing
they gained a greater and greater degree of
self-government and a civic representation
among the estates of the realm

  thus the richer merchants gradually be-

came a sort of civic aristocracy which in
its turn was at once supported and threat-
ened by those protective associations of in-
dividual crafts known as gilds it was
a long and complicated process of evolu-
tion every step of which had to be pain-
fully won by patient struggle and not

republics able to raise armies on their own
account and to treat independently with
dukes and even kings

  before the end of the twelfth century
we read of  the community of the people
of ghent proud of their towering houses
their treasures and the number of their
population and of their sending twenty
thousand armed men to the help of king
philip augustus in  we hear of
bruges too which  with many thousands
came to his help of  proud ypres
whose inhabitants are  experienced in the
dyeing of wool of arras  the ancient
city of the atrebatians full of wealth
eager after gain and profit

  flanders counted already forty similarly
prosperous cities and brabant was not far
behind with antwerp brussels and lou-
vain the civic progress of liege owing

to its masterful bishops was slower but
of the martial spirit of its burghers and
of the position of such cities in the life of
the time one gets a vivid idea in walter
scotts quentin durward but the
dramatic story of ghent and jacob van
artevelde best illustrates the proud pros-
perity of the medieval flemish city and
the princely role often played by its chief
burghers

  it must be premised that a chief element
of the general prosperity of flanders was
its monopoly in the importation of english
wool in the early part of the fourteenth
century as the flemish weavers led the
world for skill so england owing to its
comparative freedom from war was the
only wool-producing country in europe
thus the finest cloths and linens were
woven in flanders and on this account it
 

b e l g i u m



was the policy of the counts of flanders
to cultivate english friendship wool was
the bond on both sides between england
and flanders for three centuries from the
period of the edwards to the end of the
time of the tudors -

 now when edward iii claimed the
throne of france so essential to his suc-
cess did he consider this friendship of the
flemish weavers that he sent over an em-
bassy to make sure of their support and
the importance of ghent and its burghers

may be realized from the fact that his am-
bassadors were instructed to win over its
chief burgher jacob van artevelde iirst
of all for artevelde was an even greater
power in flanders than the count of han-
ders himself

  it was at arteveldes advice that ed-
ward proclaimed himself king of france
and such was the affectionate familiarity
between the great king and the flemish
burgomaster that edward called the worthy
jacob  chcr corn fibre  and  grand ami

liberty in northern europe was torn to

too frequently democracy has rewarded its

ness and disaster throughout the whole his-

belgium in the tenth century-at this time after the division of charlemagnes empire
flanders was a fief of the kings of france while lower lorraine
known later as brabant belonged lo germany

 pages of history might never have been
 written

   as it was it was soon to be seen that by
 checking the power of the nobles the cities
 had only played into the hands of ambi-
 tious sovereigns and helped to build those
 absolute monarchies which were now to
 replace the feudal system in  on the
 death of louis ii count of flanders the
 male line of the reigning house became ex-
 tinct and flanders passed to his son-in-
 law philip the bold of burgundy by the
 beginning of the fifteenth century the
 whole of the netherlands had been brought

 under the burgundian rule of philip the
 good

   in one important respect the burgundian
 princes were of benefit to the netherlands
 they were liberal patrons of the arts and
 it was under their protectiofi that the great
 school of flemish painting took its rise
 the master jan van eyck being court
 painter to philip the good but their rule
 was not imposed without resistance from
 the burghers the city of ghent being once
 more the storm center of revolt for this it
 paid by heavy humiliation and the curtail-
 ment of its ancient liberties
ol 

belgium



  the institution of the famous order of
the golden fleece at this time was one of
the means employed by the duke of bur-
gundy to create a party of nobles in op-
position to the free cities one advantage
for some time enjoyed by the burghers
over the nobles lay in the use of artillery
which was still a novelty an iron gun five
meters long of a caliber of sixty centi-
meters employed by the burghers of ghent
in  has become historic and bombs
were also among their weapons their
wealth enabled them to hire those  free
companies bands of professional soldiers

which were now becoming features of war-
fare and of which we hear so much in all
the flanders wars

  as a result of the insecurity of the coun-
try large emigrations of flemish weavers
into england added to that countrys pros-
perity at the expense of flanders while
nature herself by the silting up of some of
the smaller rivers brought about the de-
cay of bruges and ypres to the advantage
of antwerp still amid all the turmoil of
repression and revolt the manufactures and
commerce of the netherlands continued to
increase as by irrepressible natural energy

 the accumulation of wealth seemed to be
 in the very nature of the people

   in  by the marriage of mary of
 burgundy with maximilian afterward em-
 peror of germany the netherlands passed
 under the rule of the house of hapsburg
 of this marriage was bom philip the hand-
 some and he in turn was the father of
 the great charles v with whose reign be-
 gan the heroic age of the history of the
 netherlands and its tragic struggle for re-
 ligious liberty

   the calvinism which had by this time
 taken strong root in the low countries
 found an enemy in charles v less as being

 a religious heresy than a political one it
 bred fearless patriots and opposed the di-
 vine right of kings it made the wealthy
 flemings less ready to submit to the
 enormous exactions on which charles v
 relied for the financing of his various wars
 therefore its persecution became part of
 his program of absolutism

   the wealth and spirit of ghent at this
 time are illustrated by the famous incident
 of the  chastisement  of that city in
  which was the shadow of coming
 events of a far sterner nature charles had
 demanded from the province a subsidy of
 twelve hundred thousand florins of which

a still more inhuman tyrant the stupid

  philip like his father relied upon the
netherlands for the larger part of his
revenue but he was more concerned than
his father to persecute heresy for its own
sake moreover he was obstinately bent
on the impossible task of making the
netherlands another spain overawing the
cities with spanish garrisons and employ-
ing spanish ministers in the government
though races more incapable of fusion than
the spaniards and the people of the nether-
lands cannot well be conceived

  finding it impossible to break the
burghers spirit by usual methods he called
in the aid of the inquisition backed by
the arms of perhaps the most bloodthirsty
monster that ever disgraced the name of
soldier the duke of alva the persecu-
tion that ensued is one of the most familiar
horrors of history humanity still shud-
ders at the atrocities perpetrated in the
name of religion but appalled as is the
imagination by that spectacle of unrealiz-
able cruelty even still more unrealizable
are the courage that could support such
tortures and the human idealism that could

  repression as ever failed of its object
alvas cruelties only resulted in the forma-

of spain as a world-power dates from his
persecution of a little people whose na-
tional spirit it fanned into a fiercer and a
purer flame to philips alva the nether-
lands made answer with counts egmont
and hoorn and william of orange

   but alas the victory of the patriotic re-
formers was far from being as great as it

might have been had all the states and
cities forgotten their rivalries in the com-
mon cause their dissensions laid them
open to the intriguing of ecclesiastical
diplomacy as well as to the subjection of
military force and only the seven northern
provinces were to escape the thraldom of
spain the remaining provinces though
still continuing to fight desperately for
their liberties were to become more and

ly irotestant moreover as we have al-
ready seen a considerable proportion of
the belgic population the walloons were
largely french in blood and tongue and
french was the language of public affairs

  possibly a modus vivendi might have
been found even among these differences
had the new dutch king proceeded with
even elementary tact unfortunately his
policy was one least favorable to cohesion
in every way he followed a dutch bias
giving dutchmen preference over belgians
in the government attempting to supplant
the french language by the dutch and
even aiming to impose the protestant re-
ligion

 uc a policy had its natural conclusion

the revolution in paris the belgian patriots

nemours son of louis philippe to occupy
the throne a french king however
would not have been acceptable to the
powers so the due de nemours wisely de-
clined the proffered honor and a more
satisfactory solution of the situation was
found by the selection of prince leopold
of saxe-coburg who was proclaimed king
of the belgians on june  

  this arrangement had been come to by

agreement between the five great powers
and was duly ratified by-them in a treaty
signed at london on november  
in spite of this decision of the powers the
dutch king william of nassau continued
to hold out with characteristic dutch ob-
stinacy till it was found necessary to send
a french army backed by an english fleet
in the scheldt to dislodge his garrison at
antwerp after a spirited siege of three

             weeks the city capitulated but it was not
             till  that difficulties between holland
             and belgium were entirely dispersed

              thus in the words of louis philippe
           u belgium owes her independence and the
           recovery of her territory to the union of
           france and england in her cause and
           what we might call her charter among the
           nations is the treaty of london of 
           it is hardly necessary to say that recent
           events have given this treaty a supreme
           importance in the history of belgium it

	may be interesting to recall the exact dates

            of its ratification by the various powers
            concerned-by belgium on november 
             by france on the th by great
            britain on december  by austria and
            prussia on april  t and by russia
            on may  

                its chief international significance lay in
             the clause providing that belgium  shall
             form an independent and perfectly neutral
             state this neutrality carried with it such
             a heavy burden of responsibility that it is
             a little difficult for the lay mind to realize
             wherein it was such an amazing boon and
             what difference there is between being a
             neutral nation on such terms and any
             other kind of nation for waiving the
             right to make offensive war on her own
             account belgium gained guarantees no
             more stable than those of an ordinary
             alliance while she was bound to defend
             herself if necessary to maintain her raison
             detre

              as a well-known publicist has expressed
            it  the important point to be remembered
            is that while belgium is a state whose neu-
            trality is guaranteed by the chief powers
            she retains in undiminished force the
            responsibility of making her neutrality
            respected and in the extreme case of in-
            vasion of affording effective cooperation
            to those who intervene for her protection

               that neutrality however served to pro-

tect her during the perilous crises of 
when england and france seemed on the
brink of war and again in  the year
of sedan-when england and france and
prussia signed a supplementary agreement
engaging themselves to declare war upon
any power who violated it the more
recent history of that presumably sacro-
sanct word does not enter into this brief
sketch of belgiums vicissitudinous past of
which little more remains to tell

  the choice of leopold of saxe-coburg
as the first king of the new state proved
an unusually fortunate one not only was
he a devoted servant of his people but his
noble personality his great wisdom and
just judgment in public affairs gave him
a unique position of influence among con-
temporary rulers by whom his advice in
international difficulties was often sought
-by none more often than by queen
victoria one of the earliest industrial
triumphs of his reign was the opening of
railroads quite or nearly the first in con-
tinental-europe

  the general commercial prosperity
which once more flourished in belgium
during his reign was no less encouraged by
his able son leopold ii who succeeded
him in  and whose most notable
achievement was the establishment of the
immensely valuable congo free slate

  leopold ii died on december  
and was succeeded by his nephew the
present king albert this gallant prince
has already proved himself worthy of his
illustrious traditions as the captain of a
people whose noble profession through the
centuries perhaps more than any other
european race has been to fight the never-
ending fight for freedom surely it may
be said of the belgians as of their frisian
ancestors that they  shall be free as long
as the wind blows out of the clouds and
the world stands

   when i am dead

the wind will roar above when i am dead

the sun take dusk and the great dawn flare red

the trees will sway above when  am dead

and times mad chariot whirl forever sped

while i drop back to that from which i came

men will be seared with the brief whip and flame
of pitiless life but let two lovers pass-

i shall forget and sing beneath the grass

the price of freedom

        by garrard harris

          illustrated by john h cassel

he boy gazed at the three-
room shack which was his
home and a wave of disgust
surged over him

  really the house was no
worse than the one they had
lived in last year or year before last each
time on a different plantation except that
this one had larger cracks in it and the two
main rooms were rough-ceiled with planks
-therefore there were more rats

  however the last misguided tenant had
foolishly rived out sufficient white-oak
pickets to go around a good-sized garden
spot those pickets saved a lot of work
and compensated for some of the disad-
vantages each one made four good pieces
of stove-wood and being brittle and dry
only two licks with the ax were necessary

  the door to the empty corn-crib creaked
dismally on rusty hinges from his seat
on the rail-fence a bit down the road
where he had been picking the half-dried
persimmons from the top rail they having
fallen from the tree above at the first frost
the boy eyed his father in the field beyond
searching in a half-hearted manner among
the luxuriance of cockle-burs for any over-
looked bolls of cotton

   you hen-nery aw hen-ner-ree-e
hen-nery dodds if you dont come ere an
chop me some stove-wood ill bust yore
haid

  henry never turned to look at the slat-
tern figure of his mother standing with
hands on the straight lines where her hips
ought to have been her face was dia-
mond-shaped - widest at the wide cheek-
bones sloping downward to practically no
chin-then from the same point upward
to a narrow skull at the apex of which
in a wad about the size of a walnut was
fastened her mouse-colored hair

  henry knew he was too far for her to
come after him he had spent most of his
fourteen and a half years calculating the
chances of sudden onslaughts from her and
endeavoring to do as little work as possible
his father had spent forty-five years calcu-
lating the same way on how he could exist
on the least effort henry meditatively
stuck another mealy sugary persimmon in
his mouth 

  mrs dodds in disgust stalked to the
garden fence yanked off two of the pickets
and with four blows of the ax had enough
wood to start the pot of collard greens
boiling for dinner then she took her
snuff-stick from her mouth gave it a care-
ful swab in the can and wiped her fingers
on the faded calico dress which was above
her shoe-tops in front and draggled on the
ground behind

  a high-stepping team of bays hitched to
a surrey came around the bend of the road
there were three men in it the equi-
page stopped opposite henry

   you live here asked one of the men
henry nodded

   wheres your father

  down vander in that cockle-bur patch
a huntin cotton-bolls

   call him wont you i want to talk
to him

  henry gave a shrill yell and the flat face
of mr dodds rose above the frost-seared
leaves henry motioned for him to ap-
proach laboriously he climbed the fence
hanging a half-filled cotton sack across the
top

   i am the agent of the united states
department of agriculture mr dodds-
this is mr rrown of the state depart-
ment and of course you know your
county superintendent of education said
the first speaker
the price of freedom



 dodds stared blankly and scratched his
 head

  naw suh-cant says i do he mum-
 bled finally

  well we want you to come to town
 friday to the farmers meeting we are
 trying to get all the farmers interested
 and well show you all how to more than
 treble your crops you own this place
 nope - jes rentin powerful pore
 place too

  what did you make this year

  bout three bales

  any corn hogs stock sweet potatoes
 molasses peanuts

 dodds shook his head dejectedly as each
 article was enumerated

  taint no use foolin ith them things
 a rentin landlord do want nothin but

 cotton-wont furnish grub fer nothin but
 the cotton

   but if you had made twelve bales of
cotton instead of three youd have money
-at that rate you could soon buy a place
and give that boy of yours a chance-give
him an education-have some money laid
up for your old age

  mr dodds gazed in goggle-eyed vacuity
from one to the other of the party his
colorless orbs showed no spark of interest
his mind groped and scrambled for a
reply

   you mean this hyar  book farmin
he asked

   some people call it that smiled the
superintendent

   naw-thats foolishness i aint never
seen nobody doin like that

   maybe not but it is being done every
year come to the meeting and bring
henry - let him join the boys corn


munseys magazine

   why theres prizes offered aggregating
two hundred dollars for the boys making
by their own efforts the greatest crop of
corn on one acre at the least expense
what is the most corn you ever made on
an acre

   twenty-five bushels on bottom land
 well theres a boy in south carolina
who made two hundred and fifty-four
bushels on sandy land

   i dont believe that

   but its so man why right here in
your own state boys have made as high as
a hundred and fifty

   i dont believe that neither it cant
be did

   it has been done

  well im a goin to try it anyhow
said henry who had come closer and was
listening intently

   you kin do what yer dern please-i
aint a goin to fool ith no sich foolish-
ness responded his father with dignity

   can you read henry asked the
superintendent

   no sir not much-but i can spell it
out slow though

   all right - you take these circulars
and pamphlets and read them all then
when you finish come to my office in town
and join the club-come to the meeting
friday if you can

   you reckon id be allowed in there in
these i aint got no cloes but these an
theyre powerful ragged the boy said
flushing as he looked at the garments more
fit for a scarecrow than a human he was
wearing a discarded coat of his fathers
and a pair of his old pants cut off and
patched to make them do

   if we were looking for merely clothes
we could have a lot of clothing-store dum-
mies brought into the meeting we are
looking for the boy beneath the clothes-
and beneath the skin said the superin-
tendent earnestly

   whats all this fer asked henry
pleased with the answer

   the government and your state want
to teach you boys how to get the most out
of phe soil so that you will be better farm-
ers make more money own your homes
and better homes with more comforts than
your parents have ever had everything
in the world has improved except agricul-
ture and the people who live by it we
will help them if they will meet us half-
way

   ill be there said henry with deci-
sion

   good - well look for you see you
later the whip flicked the backs of the
bays and with a wave of the hands the
party whirled up the road

   thats all foolishness stubbornly an-
nounced mr dodds there was a far-
away look on the face of the boy

   maybe tis dad but im plumb sick
of livin like a passel of niggers movin
from one place to another an doin no
good on none of em we jes range round
like cattle an all we get out of it is a
livin-an a mighty poor one at that

   ther haint no money in farmin no-
how said his father in a whining tone

   not the way we do it-i know that-
but there is folks that gets rich at it-
some right in his settlemint

   you dont expect ter git rich at hit
do ye sneered the man cmshingly

  yes i do passionately responded
the boy  some day im tired of livin
in rags and cabins im tired of squattin
on some other mans land to be chased off
at the end of the year because we aint no
good an dont make the rent half the time

i	want to own some land-an if other
folks can do it i can

  his father stared at him with colorless
bovine eyes and was roused to a feeble
resentment at his attitude

   aw yere a durn little fool we aint
nothin but  pore wite trash as the nig-
gers an rich folks calls us my daddy
was one-he never owned no niggers be-
fore the war ner did his daddy hit takes
money ter make money

   it takes work an im goin to find out
how to do that work

  the boy walked up the road ensconced
in a sunny fence-corner he laboriously
spelled out the information in an ele-
mentary treatise simply written on the
subject of corn-growing

  when he had finished he felt dazed-it
was all so simple just to prepare the
ground loosely so that the ravenous rootlets
could reach the food stored in the soil
then to see there was plenty of food there
for them and to keep the ground stirred
and loose so that the moisture could not
evaporate with seed of sufficient vitality
and of a good variety that was all

  he read the pamphlets twice before go-
ing to the meeting and once there he hung
eagerly upon every word the speakers ut-
the price of freedom



a great terror gripped him and he slipped out ob the door near where he sat

tered he found that there was a great
agricultural school maintained by the state
for boys who wanted to learn and that an
opportunity was offered for those who had
no money to work their way through

  full of a consuming ambition he re-
turned and marked off an exact acre on the
sterile farm-they were to keep it another

under to rot until spring the doddses
had no stock consequently there was no
barn-yard fertilizer he ranged the fields
and meadows with a gunny-sack collect-
ing the dried droppings and piled them on
a corner of his acre with layers of leaves
between to rot and form a compost heap
to be used in the furrows at planting-time

year as the owner could not find another
tenant for the unproductive place

  he packed dead wood and brush upon
his acre and burned it for the ashes to add
the needed potash and lime to the soil
he worked ceaselessly for two weeks gath-
ering dead leaves and spreading them upon
the land thickly to be turned under to
form humus and lighten the earth

  he pledged himself to a neighbor to cut
two cords of stove-wood in return for that
neighbor deep-plowing the- acre with a
three-mule team and turning the leaves

  a wind-storm unroofed a corn-crib in
which a neighbor had stored four wagon-
loads of cottonseed and a weeks rain had
soured and heated them henry bought
the damaged cottonseed and the privilege
of a wagon to haul it over to his compost
pile by promising to deliver another cord
of wood

  he saw little of his parents these days
-he was up with the dawn planning
scheming working on his acre or in the
woods cutting stove-wood with which to
fill his contracts his mind was full-


munseys magazine

surging and teeming with thoughts and
ambitions

   he would win one of those prizes-he
would do it if human endeavor could ac-
complish it on bitter days when other
people hugged the fire he swung his ax in
the woods on his fifteenth birthday he
measured up two cords of his own-he had
paid his debts now he was accumulating
working capital there would be the
spring rebreaking and bedding of the land
to pay for a sack or two of commercial
fertilizer and a hundred pounds or so of
nitrate of soda for the final stimulant for
his corn he could settle for all these with
his wood

   he dreamed at night of buying decent
garments and going to the agricultural
school on the prize-money he would win
by selling his corn the thought spurred
him through days of blistered hands and
aching back he saw the broad well-tilled
acres of his own as he sat upon a log and
munched his cold pone of corn bread and
bit of soggy salt pork at noon in the woods
time was too valuable to waste in going to
dinner

   the winds of early march dried the
land sufficiently for working it was re-
broken and bedded the first of april the
crumbly mellow beds were opened into
furrows the now rich and rotted compost
distributed in them selected seed had
been got for all the club boys and it was
planted and covered

   then the boy was called upon to help
his father in the fields but the scanty crop
planted by the elder dodds required little
except perfunctory attention he paid no
heed to henrys work and took no interest
in what the boy was doing he gruffly si-
lenced him when he tried to interest his
father or explain the new methods

   the corn came on apace and wonderful
corn it was-such great wide glossy leaves
such sturdy stalks passers-by marveled-
only henrys father and mother seemed
apathetic under his daily care it grew
like some enchanted crop

   the pageant of summer gave way to the
glories of autumn one odorous day of
golden sunshine and azure sky the com-
mittee came out and measured his yield-
a hundred and sixty bushels even they
were astonished

  that night the boy lay awake and
figured-at seventy cents a bushel the corn
would come to one hundred and twelve dol-

lars that in itself would insure a years
schooling and decent clothes sleep would
not come to his eyes in the darkness
broken by the squeaking and scuffling of
the rats above and the snores of his father
in the next room he saw visions

  fearful and abashed he hung on the
outskirts of the crowd at the court-house
the day the prizes were to be awarded
mr dodds had walked to town with him
and henry watched him furtively talking
with colonel simmons the lawyer

  a hush fell over the meeting-the prize-
winners were about to be announced the
county superintendent rose and read from
a list he held

   the committee has awarded the first
prize one hundred dollars in gold to
master henry dodds-the second prize of
fifty in gold to-

  the rest of it did not matter to henry
a surging pcean as of many trumpets was
ringing in his ears

    i can go i can go was his first ex-
ultant thought

  when his name was called to come up
and receive his prize a great terror gripped
him-a shame for his ragged clothes and
unkempt hair his gaping shoes-and he
slipped out of the door near where he sat
and fled like some shy wild thing

   is there no one here to receive the
money for henry inquired the super-
intendent

   im his daddy - ill take hit an-
nounced the elder dodds shambling
eagerly forward the money was counted
out into his trembling hand-five bright
heavy double eagles he slouched down
the aisle half afraid to look again lest it
would not be true that he had a hundred
dollars in his hand he had never held
that magnificent amount of cash before
he gripped it fiercely a half snarl upon
his lips-the same expression one sees upon
a dog making away with a bone to devour
in secret

  henry had gone home he felt that he
must get out of town he must have room
and free air in which to expand more-
over he did not want that crowd to see
him but to-morrow-ah to-morrow he
would return sell the corn too buy some
decent clothes a trunk and a ticket to the
goal of his hopes-the agricultural college
two hundred miles away

  dusk had fallen as he walked into the
cabin
r

the price of freedom



   ma i won first prize-a hundred dol-
lars he cried joyously

   im powerful glad son but im afeerd
theres some trick in it

   oh its all right and i want to leave
for school to-morrow

   well i dont see nothin to hender
ye wheres yer pa

   i left him in town

  it was ten oclock at night before a
maudlin medley of song curses and loud
thick-tongued talk rose above the clatter
of a wagon which came to a stop in the
big road opposite the shanty

  in the moonlight henry and his mother
watched from the front door two figures
assist a third to the ground as the man
lurched up the path the wagon drove on
he strode in the door and surveyed his
wife and son with bibulous gravity they
eyed him in wonderment

  a brand-new slouch hat adorned his
bulbous head a shoddy suit of bizarre
make and cloth new shoes a flaming red
and green tie and a shirt with large pink
stripes on it completed a startling en-
semble his vest-pockets  bulged with

cheap cigars one of which he was licking
preparatory to lighting it smelled like a
gasoline torch in one coat-pocket was a
bottle of liquor from the other protruded
five long plugs of tobacco

  in the light of the smoking lamp which
had no chimney he stood eying his wife
and son defiantly albeit his gaze was not
steady and he leaned heavily against the
mantel with feet wide apart

  henrys heart sank he surmised the
source of such splendor

   i don puppose to go roun lookin like
er dawg no more truculently announced
mr dodds  by gosh i got money-
plenty of it-see

  he brought forth a handful of gold
pieces silver bills and slammed it on the
table-another handful still another mrs
dodds forgot her seething wrath in wonder

   whered ye git hit she demanded

   i sole my cawn-got a hunnerd dollars
fert

  a cry escaped the boy

   why dad that corn ought to a
brought a hundred an twelve each
cent had been conned and its purchasing

dollars would pay his expenses at the
school for almost two months

  his father swayed and straightening
up glared at him

 corn  made worked for cut wood for

his voice rose shrill and passionate and
his hands were clenched

  aw you shet up taint yore cawn
-i ast cunnel bill simmons an he said
by law bein yer daddy i was entitled to
all you made by gum thets my cawn
an thats my money

  henrys senses reeled he could hardly
see and he extended his hands blindly

   daddy - daddy you aint gone an
took my prize-money too he wailed

  the grotesque figure bobbed its head
mandarinlike an expression of sly satis-
fied power upon his face

   yeh - suttinly - thats mine too i
got hit-an im a goin ter keep it too

   well all i got ter say is yere a low-
down dawg ter take ther childs money
announced mrs dodds shrilly

  her husband was tasting for the first
time the joys of power and the feeling of
affluent drink

   don keer what you think-an whats
more hes got ter plant two acres more
like that next year an th nex an th
nex till hes twenty-one what he makes
blongs ter me

   do you mean faltered the boy in a
low dazed tone as if half afraid to ask
the question  that youre going to keep
all my money and not let me go to school

  his father nodded emphatically and
took a pull at the bottle  thats per-
cizely what i mean by gum he announced
with finality

  oh my heavens the boy shrank
gropingly toward the door to the next
room and in the dark there threw him-
self across the ragged quilts and corn-
shuck mattress that formed his bed a
torrent of bitter tears burst from his eyes
his castles were all down about his ears

  the sounds of a quarrel long and loud
came from the room he left by degrees
it subsided to break out at fitful intervals
marked by the heavy thump of the bottle

being set back upon the bare table at
last followed stertorous snores

  the boy was sobbing quiveringly in the
dark his sentence to the galleys was not
an inviting prospect for him in lieu of
what he had dreamed

  the cocks were crowing for midnight
when his mother softly opened the door
and tiptoeing to the bed sat down beside
him he felt her rough toil-worh hand
caress his brow there had been little
tenderness between the two-somehow the
fight for existence had routed all such
sentiments on the surface yet in his hour
of loss and sorrow the boy instinctively
pillowed his head upon the shrunken
bosom and threw his arms about her neck
as he had done in his baby woes

  she sat rocking slightly her arm about
him and her free hand patting the tear-
drenched cheeks at last his racking sobs
ceased and he merely quivered with each
breath

   honey child she said softly  im so
sorry-hit aint right-hit aint right
he snuggled closer

    love ye son an ye shant grow up
ter live like weve lived an im proud
of ye son-an yeve been a good boy
he patted a withered cheek tenderly

   yer paws asleep in thar with his
head on that pile o yore money-an i cd
git some of hit fer ye

   nom he replied dully  its hisn
now-hes done took it let him keep it i
wouldnt touch a cent of it its the price
of my freedom im goin away

   yyhere to son

  im a goin to leave this very night
ithout a cent an walk to that school-its
two hundred miles but im a goin if i
live i can work through

  without a word the woman brought the
smoking lamp from the other room and
tied up a few ragged clothes in a bundle
-the best he had she combed the boys
hair-ah how often had she done that
when he was no higher than her knees
with her apron she wiped awav the traces
of his tears and got his hat from the other
room and placed it on his head

  then kneeling before the cheerless fire-
place she groped until her skinny fingers
clawed up a loose stone she blew the cov-
ering of ashes off and there lay four five-
dollar gold pieces

  she rose and thrust them eagerly into
his hand
the price of freedom



   take em sonny - theyre mine - i
aimed em ive picked cotton for em
an saved em cent by cent and year by
year gainst th time when youd be sick
since you was a little chap sos thered be
money fer th doctor an fer medcine an
then ef-ef you died i couldnt bear to
think o my baby boy a lyin all ragged in
an old plain pine coffin bought by charity
an buried the same way

   ive gone hungry sonny rathern

an cold an stented myself to keep it
take em my baby child its all i cn give
except my love

   go away an make a man of yourself
henry-an oh sonny-sonny i want you
to have yore chanst - but please dont

never quite forget yore pore old mammv
-will you son

  she threw her arms about his neck and
wept for he was all of love she had

  as he turned at the bend of the road for
a last look in the door of the cabin a
gaunt time-scarred woman stood holding
the spluttering light high above her head
she shaded her streaming eyes with the
other hand

  then he put his face to the north and
as he passed over the crest of the hill and
faced the pole star gleaming with a light
as high as his own resolve his own eyes
welled again and a great hunger for the
gaunt woman in the doorway gripped his
heart

   ox fifth avexue

 far wandered from his wonted deck
 my sailor stood with lips austere

 and clean cool eyes and rounded neck
 that comes of hauling at the gear

 clad in his smartest stood he there

 aloof alert before the crowd

 with yellow close-curled saxon hair

 good shoulders and a torso proud

 what thinks he of the throng i mused
 and watched him stare with steady gaze
 of eyes to star and beacon used

 to northern mists and tropic blaze

 for he was fresh from hostile seas

 and straits where baffled currents swirled
 from waves that crush and winds that freeze
 before the headlands of the world

 and he on drunken decks had trod

 lost in the storms black universe

 when the stark spirit knows her god

 yet greets him with a mindless curse

 when man among unshaken men

 he served the wills that stood to foil
 the hurricanes compulsion- then
 turned at its close to meaner toil

 what are his thoughts i mused again

 as briskly on the sunlit pave
 passed follys clan the weak the vain

 the fop the parasite the slave-

 thousands by thousands through the hours
 withdrawn from lifes realities

 and blinded to the wholesome powers
 that walk the mountains and the seas

 i gazed and there was none to warn

 i gazed incredulous and saw
 those eyes that held the seas in scorn
 filled now with envy and with awe

	-  

          by samuel j lewis

t came as suddenly as the
flashing sword of death

  in the morning big lenz-
surname struegman but big
lenz to all the countryside-
was a rather phlegmatic and
wholly unromantic gardener laying aside
his long-stemmed after-breakfast pipe to
worry and scrabble every square inch of his
pocket-size farm literally to force and
jerk and wrest from it the necessaries of
life

  if occasionally he wrung from the re-
luctant soil a few skimpy comforts for
marie and little lenz that was only be-
cause big lenz was stolid and untiring
and knew not much but how to work and
smoke and love also occasionally he
kissed marie and little lenz-whenever
he had nine and thought of it

  in the morning marie was a broad-
backed deep-lunged fat-fisted girl-wife
who flat-footed about the house and yard
punctuating her toil with shrill yelps at
little lenz to keep that head of his out of
the rain-barrel and those meddling hands
and feet out of the butter-pail marie too
found time to lavish her kisses with a pro-
fuse abandon they were moist volumi-
nous kisses as became her style and size
but they were the kisses of true love and
big lenz and little lenz appreciated them
at their full worth in spite of their ex-
plosive qualities

  at noon big lenz was a soldier in capa-
ciously bagging trousers and ill-fitting coat
with ridiculous flapping skirts a flat cap
was on his head beneath it a colored
handkerchief was tucked to curtain his
neck against the august sun he was al-
ready several miles from home whistling
and humming as he ambled along with a
thousand others he was going into battle
he was going to ride on the train he
might perchance also ride on the wings of
death but big lenz was not afraid it
was all in a mans work

  at noon marie brown hair flying red
cheeks still redder if possible skirt tucked
around her knees and bare feet stamping
an emphasis to her rage was bitterly anil
raucously reviling a regiment of invading
cavalrymen- great hulking lazy swine
she dubbed them-who trampled the gar-
den truck into the ground from whence
it had sprung stampeded the two cows
burned the sheds to give their approach-
ing field-guns a free range of the garrisoned
town in the distance and created a most
astounding havoc all of which was to
the intense delight of eighteen-months-old
little lenz and the boiling choking smoth-
ering exasperation of buxom marie who
for the first time in her twenty-one years
fell back for relief upon the profanity of
her fathers

  at night big lenz hung with cartridges
tin cup blanket and smaller accouterment
as a christmas-tree is strung with baubles
detrained in the open country some sixty
miles from his dismantled farm he washed
in a shallow creek ate what was handed
to him from a perambulating army kitchen
heard the locomotive whistle shriek and
watched the train back away

  he noted that the camp lay between the
stream and a woodland that sentries were
thrown out on every side and precautions
taken against sudden attack off in the
distance heavy guns barked and coughed
dully but no shells came his way at an-
other point a great red reflection on the
dark sky showed where a village was in
flames smaller illuminations in the same
general direction told of individual farm-
houses going up in flames

   all the reflections big and little were in
the path of the enemy persistently ad-
vancing but still too far away to attack
leaving big lenz no cause for immediate
worry he was lucky escaping sentry de-
tail and having nothing to do but smoke
and talk and then when the excitement
had died down to roll in his blanket and


women and children last



sleep with his head pillowed on his rifle-
butt

  here was genuine novelty a man s pas-
time something to remember when he had
grown old so he continued to whistle and
hum by turns why not had he known
 this is the life he would have added
the tune his repertoire for big lenz
manlike was happy on a full stomach and
a full pipe

  he did give a fleeting thought to marie
and the boy what were they doing hav-
ing a fine time probably with plenty to
eat and little to do but why speculate
surely they were being cared for as the
wards of a watchful and paternal govern-
ment then he dismissed them to listen to
a comrades funny story

  at night marie slept with a score of
other refugees on the floor of a neighbors
house little lenz cuddled in the crook of
her arm and in his baby dreams he pum-
meled the mothers hard flesh with his tiny
fists just as he had heard her threaten to
pummel the despoilers of the struegman
acre

  the struegman house had been taken-
only temporarily marie had been informed
by a fiercely mustached colonel who bris-
tled with hair and side-arms-as a sort of
combined mess-hall and headquarters for
the officers of a cavalry outpost every
fence shed growing plant and vine had
been leveled with the ground only the
house remained and that merely through
the enemys temporary necessity doubt-
less it too would be razed when the great
guns began to boom

  some of maries oxlike stoicism fell
away and she wept in a shaking mum-
bling heaving manner her womans heart
was great in proportion to her body and
strength she had not often cried in her
life and her sobs were almost cataclysmal
as she held little lenz to her and found
comfort in his sleepy blows

  she thought of big lenz and how he
fared she knew his danger was great
she had heard her elders speculate on this
war and speak of the million lives it
would surely cost when it came ponder-
ing the possible death of big lenz was
terrible not because she questioned her
ability to provide for little lenz-she had
strength to make a living for a dozen such
-but because she loved her man and their

  anfl a half years of married life had
been very happy

  lenz and marie were still reckoned as
honeymooners by the neighbors their
home had been built with their own strong
arms wedded when they were both chil-
dren in years they had already come up
from little or nothing to a fair degree of
prosperity and certainly to much content-
ment but in a moment this meager for-
tune had utterly vanished-and lenz too
might be gone forever just like the crops
and the cows

  then because there were others crying
and it became monotonous and unsatisfy-
ing to weep where none had time to sym-
pathize marie finally ceased and fell into
a sleep disturbed by visions of battle of
heaps of dead and wounded men each with
the face of her big lenz and of death
caparisoned like a gigantic ruthless soldier
riding his coal-black steed through smoke
and flame and withering hopeless catas-
trophe

ii

  three days later big lenz had his first
smell of battle being a sturdy virile
patriot to whom fighting came almost as
naturally as work he sniffed of it long and
deep

  when the sun was only two hours high
the bullets began to pepper and sing
around the army machine in which lenz
was a very small and apparently inconse-
quential cog a mile away on either side
of a grove of trees little brown spots rose
and fell with each rising there were tiny
jets of smoke white in the clear air and
soon disappearing on the breeze

  the enemy was pushing forward in
force coming on relentlessly as- he had
been doing for days those bobbing spots
now visible now hidden were his skirmish-
ers sent out to reconnoiter to feel out the
opposition to pick out and lay bare any
weak spots then to draw aside so that the
field-guns could mow and harrow a path
for the vanguard

already high over the heads of the ad-
vancing skirmishers the shells from the big
guns in the rear described their swift
parabolas there was a rumbling roar
constant and tremendous as the monster
war engines belched shot after shot look-
ing far off lenz could see them mounted
on hillocks and for a time he unconsciously
became oblivious to other things in noting
the interval between the appearance of the
puff of smoke at the cannons muzzle and


munseys magazine

the instant when the dull boom reached
his ears

  he heard two officers stop-watches in
hand figuring in split seconds the precise
difference between sight of smoke and
sound of shot to determine the actual dis-
tance of the batteries but this was car-
rying things too far afield for lenz the
technical discussion appealed to him much
less than the more immediate and vital
fact that a comrade ten feet away had
sunk to the ground with a bullet through
his chest just as the man he had slept next
to the night before was being carried away
bleeding from a ghastly open shrapnel
wound in his neck

   now with the onrush of the skirmishers
part of the enemys plan became apparent
from the shelter of the grove and its under-
brush a masked battery of machine guns
opened viciously on the brigade of which
big lenz was a unit while attention had
been diverted to skirmishers and distant
field cannon these small and spindling
slayers little larger than a photographers
tripod and camera had been slipped among
the trees under cover of a hill just behind
it was impossible to locate them exactly
but from their concealment beyond leaves
and vines the accuracy of their aim and
the effectiveness of their leaden storm were
soon evident

  men dead and wounded began to reel
and drop singly in pairs by the half-
dozen surely it was time to do something
to stop those invisible engines to silence
the demon mechanism that mingled horrid
death with its infernal racket even the
slow mind of big lenz realized the need of
action and with his tardy realization came
the sharp order to advance

  it was in this danger-fraught instant 
that fame singling out big lenz for her
smile touched his shoulder and signaled
him on he followed as she beckoned
really there is nothing else to do when
fame takes charge of things

  with two thousand other men forming
a great human flying wedge he started
over the uneven field toward the grove
crouching and running a few yards then
going down on one knee to fire haphazard
at the unseen foe among the trees then
rushing on again

  as an immense pepper-box might shake
out its hot flakes in a fiery stream so that
deadly grove emptied its scorching searing
shots the point of the wedge was crum-

  pled and bent back the middle faltered
wavered but was pushed on by the base
men gasped cried out leaped into the air
and fell on their backs some gave no
sound but toppled face downward into the
turf tn the midst of it all lenzs mind
recalled something he had once heard-
that there is hope for a wounded man who
falls on his back none for the one who
sprawls on his face

  i he man to the right of lenz staggered
and went to his knees in the fall the
bayonet on his rifle ripped the sleeve of
lenzs coat and pricked the flesh of his
arm a soldier just in front screamed
spun around and groveled on hands and
knees lenz tripped was pushed from
behind and pitched over him cursing and
scrambling

  he sprawled flat for a moment over the
fallen one-an officer-and in doing so his
hand came in contact with a revolver-butt
bewildered his eyes blinded with dirt and
dust lenz sprang to his feet his left
hand clutched the revolver his right still
grasped the rifle by its middle he was
pushed on forced on for another hundred
yards and finally with fifty other dirty
panting sweating comrades catapulted
into the edge of the wood

  just ahead and at last in plain sight
were the rattling popping machine guns
their fire was directed over his head and
lenz watched them for one brief impres-
sive moment

   on a trip to the big city a year before
he had seen a tall building rearing its frame-
work toward the sky air-driven riveters
pounded and pecked at the structures steel
ribs yes that was it those terrible
things hidden away in the wood sounded
exactly like the automatic riveters-indeed
like a thousand of those riveters

  but in the city the work had been con-
structive upbuilding here it was destruc-
tive down-tearing each of these pecks
each hammer-blow-eight hundred a min-
ute from each machine-meant a half-
ounce of lead sent to search out a human
billet and each gun so lenz had been
told although the figures were too large
for his comprehension was capable of
discharging eighty thousand shots without
reloading

  something just beyond the vomiting ma-
chines attracted his attention there on a
horse pointing this way and that with a
saber was a strapping young officer the
o 

women and children last

gold braid on breast and sleeves the heavy
epaulets the trappings of the animal he
bestrode all proved him a man of consider-
able rank

  then fame still beckoning urged lenz
to a daring deed

  once when a boy on his fathers farm
far up a wooded hillside a wolf had slain
half a dozen calves and had worried and
torn to death the dogs sent against it
young lenz in his anger had planned a
peculiar vengeance he baited a trap with
a rabbit and then when the wary ma-
rauder refused to be captured by gripping
steel had lain in wait and caught it with
his bare hands he held it prisoner in a
wooden cage in the barn-yard until his
father insisted that it must be killed be-
cause of the terror its howls and yappings
created among the farm animals

  something akin to that old anger
surged over lenz as he watched the officer
and saw him directing the murderous work
of the guns here then was the man-
wolf the executioner who had sent into
eternity so many of the comrades the coun-
trymen beside whom lenz had slept and
ate and smoked

  he would capture this man-would put
him in a cage for all the world to see and
mock and revile yes just as he had caged
that other bloodthirsty wolf and he
would make the punishment all the more
humiliating by bringing it about through a
contest of bodily strength-he a peasant
against this scion of nobility this upstart
of rank

  lenz saw his fifty fellow soldiers throw
themselves at the guns they closed upon
them in a hand-to-hand struggle with pistol
and bayonet the gun-crews fell in heaps
one by one the deadly weapons were si-
lenced overturned

  in this big lenz took no part his was
to be a flank movement for a greater vic-
tory he nosed through the grass and
bushes around to the right of the officer
and at the moment when the latter seeing
his command overwhelmed and his guns
put out of action turned to flee lenz
sprang at him

   he whirled his rifle-butt aloft and struck
at the officers helmet-a blow that would
have crashed through steel and hair and
bone had it landed but it did not land
it slipped over the helmets side grazed the
mans shoulder and fell on the neck of
the horse

  the animal reared squealing on its
legs and the officer slashed furiously
lenz with his saber in mid air l-
caught the wrist of the saber hand clir-
ing it and stopping the blow so it
knocked off his cap

  but the plunging horse descending
all fours struck lenz with its hoof --
ripped him from hip to knee teas
through clothing and flesh and muscle
most to the bone still holding the office-
right hand even though the left fist rai
blow on blow straight in his upturned fa-
lenz with his free hand jerked from 
belt where he had stuck it the revolver
had taken from the fallen man outside
grove then realizing that he was 
match for maddened animal and desper
man he shot the horse and with g--
mighty heave pulled his struggling nruni
clear of its falling body

  his revolver held to the mans back i
ordered a forward march keeping the pa
himself in spite of his dragging leg ancj
excruciating pain of the wound reachic-
the open the stolid lenz who probab-
had never laughed heartily at a joke in it
life felt moved to indulge in a brief bit o
pleasantry

   so you lose me my cap did vou
he grumbled  all right then-j t
yours thats fair

   he seized the disarmed officers glitteri-
helmet and planted it above his own e
zip s-s-s pst half a dozen bulk
sang around his head big lenz was b
ginning to think more quickly now a
he understood instantly that the enemv
head-gear made him a target for his ow-
companions

   take back your fools cap he crie

 the wearing costs too much 

  he hastily clapped it back upon ti
head of the man with whom he was pe
forming a fair imitation of the lock-ste
this peculiar action viewed from afar ev-
dently brought pause to the marksmar-
ship for no more bullets came the wav
the pair big lenz marched his capth
straight into the presence of his color
and staff

  would the officer with his arms ale
and a pistol-muzzle in his ribs please vi
his name and rank fie would indeed
he was rather proud of that name f-
was count franz diesendorff captain c
artillery there they had it they cou-
make the most of it


munseys magazine

  so ho big lenz struegman a simple
peasant unskilled in battle-a soldier of
the second rank and only four days from
home-had taken with his own hands the
son of the enemys minister of state

   war might be wearisome brutal inhu-
man but after all it was not so bad
when fortune smiled there was glorious
opportunity for even the most obscure and
insignificant

  so ho marie and you little lenz
there at home with nothing to do but sit
and eat yourselves gross and fat if you
could only see the husband and father
now

  so thought big lenz then from loss
of blood and the blinding grinding agony
of his leg wound he crumpled to the
ground

ill

  tenderly they laid big lenz on the
white hospital cot next to that of the
croaker his feat had won him such re-
nown that his life was a precious thing to
be closely guarded he would be an in-
spiration for others he was to be treated
in a way to urge others to do likewise
the unread gardener with the mold of his
farm still upon him must receive the care
the medical attention and the gentle
nursing that might have been accorded a
wounded general

  but the croaker-he of the next white
cot - feared neither prince nor pauper
when it came to voicing his croaks he
had been an itinerant preacher before the
war he had not sought because of his
calling to avoid what he regarded as a
duty to his country and thus he was flat
on his back

  he had fought hard and well his
wounds proved that three bayonet gashes
told that he had done his share in hand-
to-hand strife the croakers tongue
might safely wag though the rest of his
body must remain quiet and he still pos-
sessed ideas that required occasional airing
hence his sobriquet

   famine and pestilence-they make up
the ultimate price of war he argued to
those on the beds around him big lenz
among them  and it is not the soldier
who foots the bill the man goes into
action-it is all in a lifetime-so why not

a bullet or maybe sharp steel seeks him
out and he drops to a quick and painless
death or to a few hours of suffering on the

field and then to a clean soft cot with
softer hands to anticipate his every need
if he is killed his troubles and his fighting
are at an end-it is the long rest no more
forced marches no more wearisome nights
in the trenches no more of the battles
panting thirst or the torturing monotony of
the siege if merely wounded he is cared
for made well and sent home carrying
endless tedious tales of heroism to pester
his descendants and brighten his own tooth-
less old age

   but what of the ones at home
what of a land laid waste - of cities
ruined fields trampled uncultivated un-
productive what of the acres that are
plowed with cannon-balls and sown with
the dead bodies of the strong men who
might have tilled the soil and raised a
better crop than smoke and flame and dis-
aster what of a harvest of stacked guns
instead of the good stacked corn what
of the breeding disease that creeps and
crawls upon its victims what of the
homes dismantled and the roofless shelter-
less millions what of the weeping of the
lonesome years and the grief that grips
and numbs and crushes what of the aw-
ful waiting for the footfall that is never
heard what of a manless country and
those growing up without a fathers guid-
ing hand

   there brothers is the real cost of
war  continued the croaker warming to
his peroration  and that cost must be
met by the second the third and even the
fourth generation i have fought-i did
not shirk-i will fight again perhaps-
and i have a right to speak we men are
the privates in the ranks we are the play-
things of kings the cheap pawns on the
inonarchs chess-board but we are at least
fed-and well too napoleon said that an
army traveled and fought on its stomach
and his words are still recognized as truth
our stomachs are full that we may fight
be wounded and fight again-so that kings
may continue to rule and move their chess-
men but do you think of those who are
neither privates nor playthings who are
not even pawns whose stomachs are never
filled and whose anemic bodies run vein-
full with the waters of the sickness that
stalks in the armys wake

   remember brothers-famine and pes-
tilence

   big lenz heard in a stupid subconscious
way but he did not heed he was getting
women and children last



well coming back to his old strength and
vitality

  war a hell the idea was absurd
why hadnt the kings messenger come
only the day before and left the gay decora-
tion which even then hung from the bed-
post over his head wasnt the news of
his own tremendous deed going from one
end of the kingdom to the other wasnt
he - big lenz struegman - an honored
member of a royal order hadnt it come
in a single moment a thing for which
others toiled a lifetime-and failed there
was the decoration in ribbon and gold to
prove it and didnt he still recall every
word that the messenger had said

    his majesty wishes to be remembered
to you lenz struegman and congratulates
you upon your manly courage and great
service to your country

  could such things come except out of
war certainly not therefore war was
good

  and marie and little lenz-with their
warm house two cows half a hundred
hens and garden-stuff enough to feed half
that hospital why marie and little
lenz were at that very moment feeding
and stuffing and fattening and laughing
so that they might the more contentedly
bask in the glory that would be reflected
from the mighty the heroic big lenz

  and if that had been his experience
wasnt it also the experience of a thousand
-yes a million others the croaker was
jealous he was being gnawed by envy he
had simply failed to perform any heroic
feat the croaker was a pessimist-that
was plain

   of course big lenz had never heard the
truism that a pessimist is a man who is
compelled to live among optimists even
if he had heard it he would have lacked
the intelligence to apply it to the case in
point he knew that the croaker was an
envious pessimist who had come honestly
by his evil name

   famine and pestilence what rot

iv

   big lenz stepped from the rear of the
army ambulance at the crossroads a short
hundred yards from his homestead

   he might have ridden in state to his own
door for he had become sufficiently famous
t ssue orders to any mere ambulance-
dnver and to have them obeyed too
but he did not wish to frighten marie

she knew nothing of his coming he did
not know how to write and had sent no
word

   besides he still limped badly from his
stiffened leg although the doctors said that
that would pass away in time-probably
in a couple of years-and he would be the
same strong active man as before his
limping coupled with dismounting from an
army ambulance might cause marie a
needless scare

   so he hobbled up the road as besthe
could feeling his way on the two sticks
he had fashioned and carved during his
convalescence he had refused the cane
and crutch offered at the hospital such
polished varnished things looked too per-
manent he wanted to trudge home on his
own legs or at least on the work of his
own hands

   big lenz wore his decoration on his coat-
front and that in itself brought a tempo-
rary though perhaps false strength

   when he came at last within full sight
of his once flourishing garden-patch its
desolation brought as great a shock as his
natural stolidity was capable of feeling
sheds pens and crop were gone had dis-
appeared entirely only a few boards of

   he missed the berry-bushes the young
trees he had set out two years before and
which probably would have borne the next
season the well-house and a portion of
a lean-to shed were overturned and riddled
almost to splinters a dormer was torn
from the house roof and the whole struc-
ture seemed to reel drunkenly

   the disheartening sight took him ap-
palled and wondering from the road into
a field that he might the better observe
the unspeakable inexplicable domestic
tragedy and so stupefied and mouth
agape he came finally to his own door-
yard where marie thinner paler and pa-
thetically haggard found him when she
felt her way outside by wall and door-
jamb to ascertain who this stranger might
be

    oh lenz good lenz my man is it
really you come back to help me and the
little lenz she cried as she reached for
him with shaking hands and clung around
his neck kissing him with a feebleness that
brought a strange sense of mixed anger

and futility to the husband  oh lenz
lenz such an awful day-such a time-
such a ruin lenz everything gone-all
your work my work - gone sickness
death starvation-an awful day lenz my
man

  marie threw out her arms with a wild
gesture to indicate the vastness of the
calamity lenz had a fleeting moment in
which to note the sorrowful changes that
six weeks had wrought the woman who
had been robust and muscular had turned
gaunt and worn her cheek-bones pro-
truded through yellowing skin which had
once been rosy over the fullest cheeks
her arms showed a smooth pallid leanness
instead of a rough healthful cuticle like
brown sandpaper

   everything gone - starving - death
how you talk marie exclaimed big
lenz his self-inflated scheme for a glad
surprise badly punctured look girl
here you see something to make up for a
good deal of wfiat you call awful times

  the husband proudly tapped his breast
where hung the tricolored badge of valor
and fame

   ah the decoration - it is good i
knew it lenz when you marched away
you are my great man lenz-my brave
man and i knew you would come bring-
ing the badges of the high-ups yes i

did	lenz-so many times already i have
said it you are one lenz my man with
old rich liebstein on the hill he too
has the decoration - but not for bravery
it was given to him for helping the women
and children

  misery long pent-up turns to volubility
when released and maries speech con-
tinued like a verbal deluge

   but man how you walk-and on two
poor sticks too you are hurt lenz and
here i keep you standing come in the
house could they give you only a bit of
ribbon and no crutch no cane the
stingies do they think you can hobble
home on their decoration come lenz
we will hold each other up as we go for
i am tired and sick i tell you and did
you bring any money-did they give you
money also lenz money we must have
the sickness the hunger-they are every-
where  

  money - money no marie i got
none assured big lenz dully as he
gazed around the room trying to reconcile
his hopes of the past few weeks with the

household wreck he saw  i have service
money coming - some day - not a cent
now where would i have got money
marie then pointing to the cradle
 but little lenz how is he

   oh my man how shall i tell you
sobbed the woman to whom tears had of
late become part of the daily routine
 sick lenz with the big sickness and like
to die oh so many have died-thirty
fifty a hundred maybe they count no
more-it is too sad to know how many so
they forget to count i got it my man
little lenz too it is everywhere first
the soldiers who ruin us all then the
hunger now the big sickness but the
decoration my brave lenz i knew it
how grand it is-the ribbons and the gold
pin with your name on it is it - lenz
struegman and the crossed pen and
sword-are they gold too lenz see
we pin it to the cover on our baby boys
cradle little lenz will see it as soon as
he wakes

   food he must have lenz-food or he
dies they all say that-he must have
food when there is no food nothing-not a
loaf not a crust-in the house for three
days you go lenz my good brave man
-if you can walk so far-to liebstein on
the hill you show him your decoration
you tell him you are one with him and the
other high-ups and you tell him order
him-no you beg him lenz-to lend you
food if not the boy dies-and then i

die	too and you bring back the beauti-
ful decoration lenz then we put it where
little lenz will find it when he wakes he
must grow to know that his father was a
brave high-up but oh how sick i am-
and the baby such an awful time it has
been for us

  from a point far up the hill on his way
to the rich mans house lenz looked back
at his desolate home as he paused to rest
his aching leg he watched marie still hold-
ing to the door and waving long he
gazed and when he turned to resume his
slow journey he muttered wiping the
sweat-beads from his forehead with a cal-
loused palm

   hungry - starving sick - dving
thats it-the famine the pestilence  the
ones left behind-the wife the baby-
women and children - they are the ones
famine-pestilence that croaker told

          wenty millions of
 fighting men are now
 under arms in eu-
 rope according to
 widely disseminated
 and adopted esti-
 mates the law of the united
 states provides that our army
 shall not exceed one hundred
 thousand and it is comfort-
 ably within that maximum

   half the population of
 the earth is numbered by
 the nations and empires
 now at war the sovereign-
 ty over rather more than
 half the landed area of the
 world is involved in the
 struggle

   these big bald facts sug-
 gest the immensity of the
 crisis that grips the world
 to-day

   great nations and small
 are exerting every energy to
 establish themselves on the
 firmest possible basis of
 military security those at
 war are putting every pos-
 sible regiment of trained
 soldiers into the field and
 training more those not
 

 at war are mobilizing and strength-
 ening their forces in preparation
 for whatever emergency may arise
 all of them that is except the
 united states

   at the time of writing the war
       is only four months old yet in
       that short space the belliger-
       ent countries have demon-
       strated the wonderful possi-
       bilities of military power in
       a people prepared

         almost without exception
       they have already put into
       service forces that actually
       exceed the maximum esti-
       mates of their war strength
       as made before the war
       and they are holding out
       the confident assurance that
       they can go vastly farther
       than they have thus far
       gone in this direction

         it is fairly dizzying to
       contemplate the display of
       military capacity put for-

on this and the opposite pace is shown the largest mobilizeon ok united states troops

  yet more they have been found neces-
sary and have been employed effectively

  a year ago the accepted estimate of
great britain s war strength was seven
hundred and thirty thousand soldiers to-
day that country is said to have nearly
two million men under arms - on the
battle-line or in training it is asserted
that a third million can be pul into the
held before the end of the present year

  here is one nation actually in the busi-
ness of raising and putting forward a force

four times as large as its estimated maxi-
mum army power of a few months ago

     et mre strking is the showing of po-
tential military capacity on behalf of ger-
many the latest estimates before the
war indicated that the kaisers empire
could put forward as its  total war
strength  a little piore than five million
men i hat seemed like a theoretical rather
than a practical calculation yet a short
time ago with most of this force already in
the held a german authority put out a
computation to prove that the fatherland
could raise and handle twelve million
soldiers russia before the war was
credited with five millions and a
half as her u total war strength
now it is believed that pretty
nearly this
force is al-

 represented as being able to put into the

 a third five millions in case of pressing
 necessity

    the military resources of other countries
 involved in this greatest of wars are being
 stretched in corresponding fashion little
 portugal for instance with less population
 and less area than ohiopossesses is count-
 ed upon for one hundred and twenty
 thousand trained soldiers ready for duty
 mobilized and fit for transport to the fight-
 ing area whenever she may be involved
 while behind these is a reserve capable
 of sending as many more the little
 countries of balkania during their
 recent wars demonstrated their
 ability to put into the field
 and to maintain fighting
 forces whose numbers were
 about identical w-ith the
 count of their adult
 male populations

  it is useless to go
 into a detailed exposi-
 tion of the possible
 military capacity of
 the nations in a gen-
 eral way it is well
 understood that the
 united states is
 among important
 countries the most
 notable exception to
 jne rule of high mili-
 tary organization

  urpe has almost
 ne same area as the
 nited states inclu-
 ng alaska it has

just about four times as much population
yet europe has now something like two
hundred soldiers in service to our one

  the wrhole world is at war or in fear of
war the last half-year has demonstrated
that no nation no people no race no con-
tinent dare feel secure that its peace will
be preserved even for weeks at a time

u nited states did not need a considerable

side and the pacific on the other reason-
ably insured against such danger as would
justify a large standing army the last
century and a quarter of our history has
supported this reasoning but do the con-
ditions of to-day sustain it

  that question is looming larger every
month in the minds of men who are ob-
serving the mighty currents now running
in world affairs

of course on a new conception of the pos-
sible military needs of the nation

  opponents of a larger army commonly
justify their position on the ground that
we have a highly respectable navy and a
naval policy which designs to keep us
among the leading sea powers they urge
that our navy is strong enough and will
always be kept strong enough reasonably
to insure our safety against attack they

  when congress met at the beginning of
december it was with the issue already
largely made up-should the united states
have a new military policy that would in-
sure a dignified and secure posture among

i	he nations or should it go on confiding
in its isolation its general policy of peace
and its reserve force in numbers of un-
trained men and unorganized wealth

  congressman augustus p gardner of
massachusetts had already pending a reso-
lution for an inquiry into the countrys
state of military preparedness and had
made clear that he intended to press it to
consideration and action it had attracted
wide attention and there was evidence on
all hands of a revival of interest in the sub-
ject with which it dealt a revival based

insist that a large army would be a con-
stant temptation to assuming an offensive
that otherwise would not be attempted

  advocates of a larger army retort that
this is in fact a confession of the whole
case it there is no real danger of war
why maintain either an army or a navy
if there is real danger why not be really
prepared to meet it by having both

  isolation these army advocates say can
no longer be safely relied upon only a
short time ago the founder of the japan
society of london made a statement that
japan could and would place a large army

both the military and

would be entrusted

	i e v e that
there is real

army is admittedly
only a skeleton or-
ganization it has been
developed with the idea
that in case of need it could

rapidly be expanded to what-
ever numbers might be
needed could it

no doubt that it
 could so far as
concerns avail-

inspiring to
consider t h e
military possi-
bilities of l he

thirty-two million people

b to-day we have three times as many
people as then and more than a correspond-
ingly larger wealth if the nation should

respond as well it could within a four-year
period raise at least ten million soldiers
and support their operations in the field

the mere ability to count and to enlist
men fit for military service however is
very far from crystallizing them into mili-
tary power lord kitchener has more than
a million british recruits in training-camps
drilling and educating them to be soldiers
and he has assured his country that in six
months they will be ready to take their
places on the fighting-line but what might
have happened to great britain during
those six months if she had been exposed
to invasion ami had not had allies capable
of putting ready-to-fight soldiers into the

what might happen to us in some per-
fectly conceivable war of the future if a
single country can put half a million men
on transports and send them across the
world in two months

is it safe to say that such a war is im-
possible is it harder to conceive than the
present world-war would have been a year
  ago

upon public attention not only by events
in the old world but by the demand of
congressman gardner for a thorough in-
quiry into our preparedness to defend our-
selves mr gardner wants a national
security commission to consist of three
senators three representatives and three
other persons to be named by the presi-
dent with full powers of inquisition into
present military and naval conditions
and needs including authority to travel
wherever it might be desirable to study
foreign military systems

  mr gardner in presenting his resolu-
tion made a speech which attracted at-
tention throughout the country without
equivocation or qualification he declared

that this country is not prepared for war
either offensive or defensive that our
monroe doctrine and our policy of ex-
cluding asiatic immigrants have imposed
burdens of responsibility which cannot be
maintained without the backing of effective
power that neither our army nor our navy
-especially the former-is capable of dis-
charging the duties that would be imposed
by insistence on these policies and that as
a nation we have deluded ourselves with
the pleasant notion that we shall never
have a foreign war or if we have one that
we could somehow improvise the means
with which to carry it on

  mr gardners demand for attention to
this problem started a discussion which has
forced the issue sharply upon the communi-
ty it would by no means be fair
to say that opinion is unanimous
as to the justification of his

                                               for these facts of course we must go

not tend to avoid avar i term such dis-

 do not give a full idea of the disparity for
 practically all the european countries have
 systems of military service under which
 vast numbers of men are constantly trained
 for the army as fast as they finish their
 required service with the colors these pass
 into the reserve where they are available
 to be called to the field if wanted they
 are trained equipment is ready for them
 and every disposition is made for their
 quick utilization in case of need in short
 they constitute the second line of military
 force three to five times as numerous as
 the  peace strength  of the regular armies
 given above we have practically no cor-
 responding force at all

 while we have so small a standing army
 its wide distribution makes it still less an

   so much for our regular army
 of less than one hundred thousand
 men in popular estimate the
 regular establishment is presumed
 to be supplemented by the na-

forces just enumerated the coast
artillery is not counted as part of
the mobile army for the obvious
reason that it is not mobile it
must be kept where the defenses
are this corps is returned as
containing  officers and -
 men this is far below the
necessary strength to man the sea-
coast defenses at home and in the
colonies the chief of coast artil-
lery states that after counting the
full present strength of the coast-
artillery corps of the regular army
and the coast-artillery corps of
the militia there is still a defi-
ciency of  officers and 
men so much would the war de-
the american army



tional guard available in case of national
emergency what is the nominal strength
and what the effective force of the na-
tional guard

  by the most recent reports the organized
militia comprises  officers and 
enlisted men of these  belong to the
coast artillery the rest to the mobile forces
of militia but the military authorities de-
cline to regard the organized militia or
national guard as an even reasonably
effective military resource

  while this militia force nominally con-
sists of  officers and men the most
recent report shows that only  per cent
of these attended the annual inspections
only  per cent attended the camps of
instruction only  per cent had any prac-
tise with the rifle during the target season
and only  per cent qualified as first-
class or second-class marksmen

  not only this the regulations require
militia units to have at least twenty-four
drills of one hour each per annum-cer-
tainly a most moderate requirement yet a
very large proportion failed to get even this
small amount of drill

  if it were required to place the militia
in the field the government would be
found very deficient in equipment thus
there are  officers and men enlisted
in the cavalry but there are only 
horses available cavalry without horses
seems a misnomer but they are called
cavalry

  and when it comes to the field-artillery
branch of the militia the proportionate
shortage of horses is still greater take
the item of wagons for transport general
wotherspoon finds that if assembled in di-
visions and brigades the militia would be
 short of the necessary wagons for
transport

  if the field-artillery branch of the or-
ganized militia were called into service it
would need  more field-guns than are
now available and  rounds of
ammunition for this class of artillery in
other words besides horseless cavalry we
have a fine provision of gunless artillery

  these deficiencies cannot be remedied
out of the patriotic fervor of earnest na-
tional purpose they must be supplied by
factories and arsenals patriotic fervor
will not conjure horses and cannon and
ammunition-trains out of the atmosphere
the body of men who make up our militia
is equal to any in the world as material

      

for the making of soldiers probably it is
superior to any enlisted body of like num-
bers the men are not to blame for the
inadequacies of their organization the
law and the system are

  the law and the system-or lack of
system-provide us with horseless cavalry
gunless artillery ammunitionless guns and
defenderless coast defenses

  going to war we should be like a man
setting out to joy-ride in a fine limousine
from which he had merely omitted the en-
gine and the gasoline supply

  there is no doubt that this nation has
the human material for creating all the
military force it will ever need but it
took two full years from the beginning of
the civil war to get armies into the field
and in training on the other hand great
britain which has only a little more popu-
lation than north and south together had
at the beginning of the civil war has per-
haps a million effective soldiers n the field
now and promises another million in a
very few months why is great britain
able to turn out the best soldiers in so
much shorter time than our country could
do it

  this inquiry brings forward instantly
the difference between the british military
system and the american britain main-
tains a small standing army and is un-
likely ever to depart for any considerable
time from that policy because democracies
hate great military establishments but in
recent years-that is since the boer war
-britain has organized her reserves so
that they can be made effective in the
shortest possible time when need is pre-
sented

  the united states has no such plan if
we expect to maintain our place as a
power it would seem that the smallness of
the regular army ought to be the more
pressing argument for a greater and more
effective reserve system

  our organized militia or national
guard is not to be confounded with the
reserves of other countries the reserve
in a european country is as it were the
alumpal association of the regular army
it comprises the vast body of those who
have taken the regular army course and
graduated it is organized indexed listed
reported instructed as to places of mobili-
zation and the like

  on the other hand our national guard
might be compared to a body of students


munseys magazine

in a preparatory school getting some of
the training to fit it for admission to the
collegiate course-the army the militia-
men however take only the preparatory
course as a rule they do not expect to
go from the militia to the regular army
and seldom do so there is no contempla-
tion of such promotion under our system

  following out this comparison of a mili-
tary establishment with an educational
system it might be said that our national
guard is a small body of grade-school boys
learning a little about the  three rs  of
war and never expecting to take more than
this elementary course the reserve of a
great military country is the body of citi-
zenship that has taken the grade high
school and college courses in military
affairs has graduated and is organized in
readiness to return with this ripeness of
equipment and to serve whenever it is
called upon

  it is not so much the smallness of our
regular army as this utter lack of a re-
serve that constitutes the telling weakness
of our military system there is no other
country without some scientific and sys-
tematized organization of its reserve
forces so that they may be drawn upon
to fill the gaps in the regular force caused
by the losses of war or to expand the es-
tablishment under the necessities of war

  it has always been the military tradi-
tion of this country to have a very small
regular army and to rely on the possibility
of enlisting training and using the man-
hood of the nation when time of need
should come this plan has made our
wars long and expensive in the civil
war both sections were on an equal foot-
ing in that neither had any proper or-
ganization for putting into the field
trained effective armies it was necessary
to build and train armies after the war had
begun and therefore it was not till 
that north and south faced each other
with really effective armies competent to
achieve the best results

  it is not the purpose of this article to
discuss the political policy of maintaining
or not maintaining a large standing army
its design is simply to give a general view
of what we have and what we have not
and to suggest some of the proposals that
have been advanced for bettering the situ-
ation if it be desired to maintain a force
more nearly adequate to our needs if war
should come

  the boer war sharply reminded great
britain of the defects of her military es-
tablishment our spanish-american war
brought home to this country a like lesson
but this country has not taken the lesson
to heart and acted upon its teachings as
the british did so we see britain able to
place a million troops in the field within a
very short time despite the fact that it
has a very small standing army while an-
other million are promised for the near
future

  perhaps we shall never need the great
force that could be brought into the field
under a proper system there were peo-
ple in great britain before the boer war
who did not believe that country would
need a large army again

  there were people here before the
spanish-american war who felt similarly
secure

  there were people again in great
britain who did not believe a year ago
that it was possible for their country ever
to be called upon to arm and fight two
millions of men but all those things have
happened

  the possibility of an attempt to invade
this country despite its geographic advan-
tages has appeared much less remote by
reason of recent happenings japan hurled
immense armies across the sea of japan
into the mainland of asia a few years ago
and with them won a great war

  britain is sending large expeditionary
forces oversea with wonderful celerity in
the present war she has brought con-
siderable contingents from india canada
australia and new zealand in the cal-
culation of modern strategists who are
secure in their control of the sea half the
circuit of the globe is no insuperable ob-
stacle to moving great armies

  how then shall this country without
departing from its policy of maintaining
only a small standing army equip itself
with a reserve force available as the re-
serves of european nations have proved
themselves available in the present war
out of long study of the problem general
wotherspoon replies

   by using the standing army as a school
for the training of men who on graduation
from that school pass into the reserve
and constitute the real national military
strength

  he would have men enlisted in the regu-
lar army for two or three years active
the american army



service within which they would be made
into trained soldiers then he would re-
lease them from active service with the
colors and pass them into the reserve for
periods of five years or more as reserv-
ists they would return to the ordinary vo-
cations of civil life but would be under
obligation to resume active service if a na-
tional need should arise

  general wotherspoon calculates that the
national necessities of reasonable security
require that a standing army plus an
available reserve of this character should
be at hand amounting to half a million
troops how many men would have to be
kept in the standing army in order that
the reserve could be sufficient when add-
ed to the standing army to equal half a
million

  assuming that a period of three years
actually with the colors is necessary to
make a thoroughly trained soldier and
assuming further that the men after this
service should be held in the reserve for
five years the general calculates that a
standing army of about  would be
necessary allowing for deaths and other
losses he finds that in the first year after
this scheme came into full operation we
should have a reserve of  a year
later a reserve of  in the third
year a reserve of  in the fourth
year a reserve of  and in the fifth
year a reserve of  adding the
regular army of  to this last a
total of  available troops is pro-
duced

  general wotherspoons plan could be
modified by shortening the period of serv-
ice with the colors or lengthening the
period during which men should be under
obligation as reservists or both so as to
expand the total available force he does
not propose to abolish the militia as now
established but to make this regular army
reserve independent of it

  he does not however place much re-
liance in the militia observing that  un-
less there be a material change in the laws
governing it which will bring about an
increased control by the general govern-
ment that branch of our military estab-
lishment cannot be regarded and depended
upon as a reliable force he suggests
however that changes could be made in
the militia system placing it under pay of
the federal government and under obliga-
tion to serve it in case of war

  to produce the desired efficiency it
would be necessary to detach numbers of
officers from the regular army to help train
the militia once organized on some such
lines and brought up to a proper efficiency
the militia might then have applied to it
the same general rule for establishing a
reserve as has been suggested for the regu-
lar army

  one of the grave problems confronted
in considering any program for increasing
our potential military strength is that of
supplying officers all the authorities in-
sist that our military academy at west
point is the finest institution of its kind
in the world but it does not educate a
sufficient number of officers to handle an
enlarged army in great britain since
the present war began the heavy loss of
officers in actual service has constituted
one of the most difficult problems a sol-
dier may be trained to reasonable effi-
ciency in a comparatively short time es-
pecially under conditions of actual service
not so an officer

  various plans have been proposed for
remedying this very serious defect an
obvious one but still insufficient is to in-
crease the number of cadets at west point
which of course would be necessary if the
regular army were to be raised to about
two hundred thousand men in addition
it is probable that picked men from the
line rising through the non-commissioned
grades would be promoted to commissions
as fast as possible

  further it has been proposed to make
use of the military training establishments
of schools and colleges to equip a great
number of young officers to such an extent
that they could later be given a  finishing
course  in the regular army great
britain has a system of this sort known as
the officers training corps which has
done her good service in time of need by
supplying several thousand officers for the
army she is now forming various similar
schemes have been worked out in more or
less detail for use in the united states
but none has yet been approved by ulti-
mate military authority

  it is observable that the military au-
thorities of this country and of great
britain have in recent years turned often
to the example of the swiss military sys-
tem switzerland has a completely demo-
cratic army-that is every man in the
alpine republic is required to give military


munseys magazine

service if he is physically fit and rank in
the army is solely a matter of merit the
son of a peasant may command the son of
the richest banker in the canton and noth-
ing is thought of it where every man
must give his required stint of service to
the army there is an instant end to any
notions that the army is a refuge for men
who have failed elsewhere the uniform
commands the respect that is due to it be-
cause it is every mans uniform

  it is a curious commentary on the
democracy of america and britain that in
both there is apparent an attitude of snob-
bishness which makes the men in their
countrys uniform feel that they are looked
upon as inferiors tommy atkins com-
plains bitterly that-

its tommy this an tommy that an  tommy
   stand aside 

but its  spccial train for atkins when the
   troop-ships on the tide

in our own country there are constant
complaints of the snobbery that assumes
to pull its skirts aloof when the wearer of
the khaki appears

  that sort of thing doesnt happen in
switzerland there they begin preparing
lads for their expected military service
when they are ten years of age with gym-
nastic drills in the public schools this
physical preparation is continued when the
men reach the age for enlistment which is
twenty those with the keenest eyesight
are made artillerymen the smallest men
are sent to the cycling corps

  from twenty to thirty-two years of age
the soldier belongs to the auszug or elite
from thirty-two to forty to the first divi-
sion of the landwehr from forty to forty-
four to the second division of the land-
wehr after that he goes to the last line of
reserves the landsturm here he is liable
for service if called upon until the age of
fifty all youths of seventeen to twenty
are also liable for service in the land-
sturm and volunteers of over fifty may be
accepted for it

  in short the swiss system contemplates
making a trained soldier of every man
save a few excepted classes in the republic
the young man who is rejected on the
severe physical examination invariably
feels bitterly disappointed if not disgraced
he has to pay a special tax on account of
his immunity from army duty propor-
tioned to his income

  as soon as they reach the military age
the young men are sent to recruit schools
for their first training the school con-
tinues for only a brief period but the com-
panies in each locality have drills periodic-
ally after the manner of our national
guardcompanies the cavalry are called
out for ten days service in each year the
other arms for from fourteen to eighteen
days a year

  under this system the swiss have de-
veloped a wonderfully efficient military
force their general-staff system their
plans for mobilization and all other de-
tails of preparedness are the marvel of
military experts rifle clubs exist every-
where and by common consent the swiss
are regarded as the best body of military
marksmen in europe

  the cavalrymen are required to own
their own horses no man may be ad-
mitted to this branch of the swiss army
unless he gives proof that he can afford to
own and keep a horse when he makes
this showing and is accepted for the caval-
ry the government sells him a horse at
half its appraised value and thereafter for
ten years it pays him back one-tenth of
that amount so that at the end of ten
years the cavalryman owns his horse and
it has cost him nothing

  when not in service the swiss trooper
takes his horse home with him and may
drive ride or work it always however
with the distinct obligation that the ani-
mal is to be kept in the best condition for
cavalry service this method enables man
and horse to be acquainted and has pro-
duced some of the finest horsemanship in
any cavalry in the world

  after they pass into the landwehr the
men are not required to render service in
camp every year but every fourth year for
from eight to eleven days no time and
effort are wasted on careful drill in those
maneuvers which make for mere smartness
and trimness of bearing and appearance
the men are trained in marching shooting
and essential evolutions

  under this system switzerland-which
has only about the same population that
our american colonies had when they
achieved their independence-can turn out
a real working shooting marching fight-
ing army of about six hundred thousand
men

  the swiss have always been a military
people julius casar had some experiences
the american army



with them and a good many other con-
querors and would-be conquerors have
learned how well they could fight their
independence in no small degree depends
on the fact that they are prepared to de-
fend it

  during the war of - between
germany and france switzerland was
asked officially what it would do if a force
of one of the belligerents should attempt
to march through swiss territory the an-
swer of little switzerland was the same as
the answer of little belgium forty-four
years later

   fight

  late in the war a french army of about
eighty thousand men was pressed toward
the frontier the swiss authorities noti-
fied its commander that they were pre-
pared to protect their soil and that if he
entered it he must lay down arms and
have his force interned and he did just
that the entire force-men guns horses
munitions-was taken in charge by the
swiss nation and held until the end of the
war

  switzerland has succeeded in devising a
military plan that seems perfectly adapted
to the needs of a democracy there is in
it no menace of the domination of a mili-
tary caste such as many antimilitarists
have feared in this country its experi-
ence proves that a democracy may train
its whole manhood for the duties of war
so that it can be practically exempt from
all fear of foreign aggression and yet be
in no danger of militarism

  to establish for the united states some
system akin to this of switzerland to pro-
vide a popular and democratic army to
make this nation a military power without
making it militaristic is the earnest desire
of many of the students of our present
problems it may be taken for granted that
we shall never have a great standing army
that we may have some such organization
of regular army and adequate reserve sup-
plemented by a militia system based on the
swiss model is the hope of many men
prominent in making our national policies
they propose to press the issue until it
shall have adequate attention

 the hills call and the roads call and the sea
 with voices of remembered deeds and days
 of winds that roam the world forever free
 tempting the rover to the wander-ways

 yet though these voices hold their spell for me
 still do i linger in the citys maze

 thralled by the loud conglomerate minstrelsy
 of rumbling whistles and of hurrying feet

 of roaring traffic and the clamant beat
 of hammers on the ringing ribs of steel

 this is the citys summons this the call
 drowning the gentler voices one and all

 in rolling music of its vast appeal

 and if i seek the road the sea the hills

 a little space their ancient glamour fills
 my utmost need but presently i know
 a longing for the tumult and the press

 the fret and haste the glitter and the show
 the vast and never-sated restlessness

 and all the sounds of avenue and slum
 which make the city when i hear her voice

 i turn my footsteps homeward and rcjoice

   bite em

   infinitum-old stuff

ick burnell otherwise
known as foxy burnell came
to the fair-grounds early in
the morning and set up his
stand the mad river val-
ley fair at dillonvale is not
a big state fair it is not even a county
fair it is just a sort of neighborhood fair
consequently it has fewer visitors who
come to see the gentleman in pink tights
go up in a balloon and come down if lucky
in a parachute and more people who come
to see the cattle the horses the hogs and
the giant pumpkins

  dick burnell had discovered that busi-
ness in his line was always better at one of
these little fairs there were fewer coney
island attractions to compete with dicks
little attraction

  with a borrowed hammer and nails mr
burnell created a small table of which the
top slightly inclined he covered this
table with a piece of green baize which he
took from a businesslike black bag from
the same black bag he took three octagonal
wooden blocks each face of which bore a
number also he had with him a number
of cheap watches articles of gaudy plated
jewrelry and a revolver that looked sus-
piciously second-hand each article was
attached to a card and each card bore a
number

  you get the idea probably you paid
mr burnell a small sum of money for the
privilege of setting the three octagonal
blocks rolling down the inclined table
the sum of the three numbers uppermost
when the blocks ceased rolling was your
total if it corresponded with a number
that indicated a watch you got the watch
simple

  mr burnell the proprietor of this mush-
room establishment was a young man of
medium height thick-set and passably
well dressed his black derby hat was tilt-
ed back a little displaying a high forehead
and a fringe of black curly hair his eyes
were deep-set with projecting lids that
gave them something of the almond shape
that we associate with orientals his
cheeks were full and clean shaven

  what was most noticeable about the
young man besides his strictly business-
like air was a certain sophistication a look
of quiet passive cynicism he seemed like
a person who had lost all illusions prob-
ably he had he had been following
circuses and fairs for seven years

  among the early comers on the fair-
grounds was a tall man with a broad-
brimmed hat who wore an official badge
he spotted the stranger at once and came
over to him

   what you doing here

   looking for business

  	who told you to come

   nobody i thought youd probably
like another attraction its a straight
game try a roll go on try it it
wont cost you anything

  the tall man looked perplexed he had
an official duty but he also had a human
curiosity he lifted up one end of the box
that held the blocks and set them rolling
they rolled half-way down the plane and
stopped

   five-three-four counted the opera-
tor  thats twelve twelve is a-sure
enough twelve is a watch here take it
go on take it guaranteed for one year
see its a standard brand absolutely no
fake about this of course the chances are
in my favor or i wouldnt be here is it
all right

   why i guess so  replied the official
taking the proffered watch with a sheepish
grin
the lesser fleas



  a few minutes afterward another man
came over and stared at the outfit he
threw back his outside coat displaying a
constables shield

   whats the game young man

  the young man explained briefly at
the same time he pulled out a couple of ob-
viously good cigars

   smoke he suggested

   dont use them replied the constable

   have a watch

  the other man shook his head

   no use for it

  dick burnell bent over with a slightly
sardonic smile

   ever have any use for this stuff he
whispered placing his hand upon the other
mans

  the officer looked at something that
stuck in his palm and coughed looking
around furtively then he said gruffly

   all right no cheating though-see

   straight game absolutely replied the
young man

  after the constable had walked away
dick put the blocks back in their box re-
placed the captured watch with another
and muttered grimly

   grafters all grafters

ii

  people had begun to swarm into the
grounds a few gathered like a flock of
roosters cocking their heads questioningly
around burnells establishment

  try your luck he suggested speak-
ing to nobody in particular  you cant
lose every roll is a win and the high
numbers get the big prizes wheres your
sporting blood gentlemen be game boys
what good is your money after youre
dead

  about noon somebody won a watch from
dick dick let him rather grudgingly
the winner a farmer was very happy
about it no doubt he remained happy
about it until he remembered while doing
his chores that night that it had cost him
four dollars and a half to win a one-dollar
watch

  about four oclock in the afternoon an-
other man won the revolver dick let him
this man was in ecstasy about his high
fortune and displayed it to an admiring
crowd this was the sort of advertising
that mr burnell liked it created busi-
ness the man had paid over more than
three dollars before he won the pistol and

besides there was something the matter
with the trigger and it couldnt be fired

  a little while later the village black-
smith a french canadian tried his luck
he parted silently and hastily with the
money in his pocket amounting to seventy-
five cents then he drew back and eyed
the operator of the rolling blocks with an
expression of betrayed confidence

   by tunder meester dere is someding
crook about dose number he cried out of
an anguished heart

   back up now boy said mr burnell
without looking at his victim  dont
stand in the way of these real sports here
beat it

   eet ees crook shouted the black-
smith clenching his fists

   fade lad fade commanded mr
burnell  go get some more coin and
then ill talk with you step up gents
and roll the little blocks no blanks

  the smith looked at the little fake bits
of  jewelry  that had been thrust upon
him as a consolation prize for a minute
his face seemed to bode danger but the
supreme self-confidence of the fakir was
too much for him and he walked away
muttering strange harsh sentiments in the
language of quebec

  as soon as the september sun got low
behind the fringe of trees on the western
edge of the fair-grounds dick burnell put
his little blocks and his watches and his
cheap jewelry in the black bag together
with the green baize cloth it was one of
his rules to leave the scene of his opera-
tions a little earlier than too late in
every crowd there are hard losers who may
be thoughtless and ungenerous enough to
start trouble

  dick had had a big day but if it had
been a bad day the expression on his face
would probably have been the same
good days and bad days-he took them
all with perfect equanimity

  he stopped a moment at the merry-go-
round to hail the proprietor

   had a good day joe

    pretty fair

   see you at east durham

   sure

   going south after fair-time

   dont know yet

  the rolling-block man hired an automo-
bile to take him back to the hotel in the
village when he arrived there he went
up to his room and threw himself wearily

on the bed he had been on his feet all
day only a policeman or a department-
store clerk can really understand how he
felt

  there was a knock at the door a head
came into the room and announced

   somebody down-stairs to see you

   tell em to come up replied dick
burnell drowsily

  a few minutes later there was another
rap-a feeble one this time in response
to a bid from the bed an overgrown
freckled youth about seventeen years old
edged his way into the room

   mister he said

   my names burnell said the fakir
without looking up  what dye want
a sniff and a choking sound brought
dick sitting upright the face of the
youth indicated that he was on the verge
of tears

   it - it wasnt my own money he
stammered

   what wasnt your own money what
the-oh i see youre the wise young man
that rolled for a watch to-day and now
you want your money back eh ive seen
lots of em like you kid they all want
it back the world is full of pikers like
that

   honest mister said the overgrown
boy  i aint like that some of it was
my own and i dont care about that but
the rest wasnt mine i got excited - i
thought-

   whose was it asked dick suddenly
 i been selling tickets to the church
sale and it-was that

  the lad was trying to restrain the tears
 how much was it altogether how
much did you spend with me i mean

   two dollars and seventy-five cents
dick went into his pocket and counted
out the amount he flung it on the foot of
the bed

   listen to me you young embezzler
he said lying down again  you quit
gambling anybody that gambles on any-
thing is a fool if you got to gamble wait
till you can afford to gamble big by that
time youll probably be too wise to take
any chances anyway and listen-what-
ever you do dont gamble with other peo-
ples money now get out

   oh thank you- began the boy

   get out and leave me alone replied
the man on the bed  im tired

  there was no answer and no sound of

a retreat a few moments passed and then
dick burnell popped up his head

   you here yet he cried  what do
you want

  the youths face was cleared of its
troubles he grinned

   i thought maybe you might take a
couple of tickets to the church sale he
ventured

  well of all the cast-iron nerve ex-
claimed the fakir bursting into a laugh
 say kid youd make a good ballyhoo
with a medicine show you get your
money back and then you soak me with
-how much are those tickets

    twenty-five cents each

  dick pulled out a half-dollar from his
vest-pocket and tossed it on the bed

   give me a couple leave em there on
the bed and say when you get rich kid
with that nerve of yours and i come round
on crutches asking for a piece of bread
dont set the dog on me

   youre all right murmured the boy
admiringly

   im an easy mark you mean said
dick lying down again  now get out
will you

  a few minutes afterward mr burnell
got up yawned took the two tickets from
the bed threw them into the top drawer
of the bureau and went down to supper

ill

   it was bad business instinct on the part
of the managers of the church sale that
they permitted the event to take place in
the same week as the mad river valley
fair the result was that the people of
dillonvale w-ere short of money the sale
found itself in that predicament which so
exasperates the managers of any com-
mercial enterprise - a big crowd and no
business

  it was about half past eight a few of
the young women behind the booths hav-
ing made timid efforts to arouse interest in
their wares and having failed had arrived
at the giggling stage the face of the thin
pale young minister and the faces of the
committee wore expressions that testified
to their disappointment there was the
subdued hum of low talk such as might be
heard at funerals a cloud was upon the
scene and the best efforts of the lightest-
hearted could not blow it away

  it was just at this point that dick
burnell otherwise known as foxy burnell
the lesser fleas



entered the odd-fellows hall where the
sale was in progress

  the church sale had not been dicks
first choice of diversion he had asked the
hotel clerk whether there was a moving-
picture show in town

   only wednesdays and saturdays was
the answer

   nothing going on at all

   only the church sale

   the church sale oh thats what the
kid sold me tickets for said dick  isnt
there anything else isnt there a game a
fellow could sit into

   a game of what-dominoes was the
sarcastic answer of the clerk who came
from a larger town than dillonvale and
never lost a chance to sneer at his present
surroundings  why dont you drop over
to the sale i tell you one thing-youll
see some pretty girls there

   with their mothers dick added

   yes most of them but you can look
at them anyway thats something

   i suppose its better than going to
bed assented the fakir  ill drop in
there i guess and see whats going on
dick put on his best necktie flicked up
his boots and waved his front curly hair
to his satisfaction and then went over to
odd-fellows hall

  the moment the fakir passed through
the door a feeling swept over him that he
was somewhere he ought not to be the
smell of popcorn assailed his nostrils in-
stead of the sawdust-and-beer odor with
which he was more familiar there was
the delicate modest scent of white dresses
just taken out of bureau drawers far dif-
ferent from the choking musky perfume
which he associated with the region of
thirty-sixth street and sixth avenue
where he went into winter quarters

   this is no place for anybody but a
ministers son he murmured to himself as
he went in

  still he had a curiosity to see what this
world was like it was certainly different
from his-that is the world of his mature
years he could faintly remember being
dragged by his elder sister years ago to a
place just like this in a town just like dil-
lonvale

  dicks keen eye took in the business
situation at once

   all broke he said to himself  no-
body spending money and a very frosty
temperature

  a hand-shaking young man with a col-
lar that was nearly severing his jugular
vein strode over to dick and thrust out his
hand

   i dont believe i remember your
name he asked perfunctorily

  u burnell replied the fakir  im a
stranger

   oh yes my name is perkins-per-
kins  son shoe-store you know very
nice of you to come please enjoy your-
self this is the place to have a good
time

   thanks replied dick and he added
under his breath  this is about as jolly
as a police-station 

  dick walked once around the hall
hoping that the young hand-shaker would
introduce him to somebody even if only to
another hand-shaker but nothing of the
sort happened a few of the younger peo-
ple gathered in groups whispered and
dick knew that he was the object of their
conversation it made him feel uncom-
fortable he almost decided to make a
dash for the door but a stubborn feeling
detained him

   im just as good as they arc most of
them he thought  theyve got nothing
on me if theres anybody here that rolled
for watches they wouldnt dare to open
their mouths about it stick it out old
man stick it out something interesting
might turn up

  being an old hand at the arts of stimu-
lating business dick saw what was needed
to set the sale on its feet somebody must
begin to spend money somebody must set
the example and others would follow so
he began to buy

  he bought popcorn and gave it to small
boys and girls who took it with scared but
thankful faces he bought light fruit-cake
and dark fruit-cake and ice-cream and
home-made fudge and passed those around
soon he had a timid following of young fry
at a respectful yet watchful distance from
his heels

  he bought a dozen handkerchiefs two
pairs of woolen mittens and a knit
sweater-vest he tried his luck at the
fish-pond and the grab-bag and fished
forth and grabbed forth a quantity of rub-
bishy things which he dropped in places
where they might be found by somebody
who wanted them

  from booth to booth dick traveled
spending money impartially and carelessly


munseys magazine

  at each one one or two shy grateful
  smiles and some pleasant words from the
  young women behind the booths made the
  color come into his hardened cheeks

    dicks ruse proved effective for a while
  those of the other men who had money
  began to loosen their grip on it those who
  hadnt apparently borrowed some the sale
  began to liven up the hum of voices be-
  came more confident the set faces of the
  committee relaxed as dick passed the
  minister the minister actually smiled at
  him and nodded

    but the rush of business was short-lived
  the mad river valley fair had really
  taken too much money out of the pockets
  of the townsfolk something had to be
  done there was a hurried consultation
  in an anteroom which resulted in an addi-
  tion to the program

    a tall man with a stick of fire-wood in
  his hand knocked for order

     sh-h-h-h  said every one to every
  one else  mr osgoods going to speak
  s-s-s-s

     ladies and gentlemen announced the
  orator attention

     sh-h-h-h cant you keep that boy
  quiet annie

     keep him quiet yourself james i told
  him to hush

  stand over there a little will you
  please i cant see him

     thats right thanks

     ladies and gentlemen i am instruct-
  ed by the committee in charge to announce
  that as an added attraction and to make
  things more interesting mr parmenter
  one of our most generous workers has of-
  fered his roan horse and high-seated car-
  riage to be sold for the benefit of the
  church there will be one hundred num-
  bered tickets-mr perkins is now kindly
  making them each ticket will have a
  duplicate each ticket will be sold at one
  dollar-one dollar the duplicate tickets
  will be placed in a-er-receptacle and
  one of the children will draw one out the
  number drawn will win the horse and car-
  riage i am instructed to announce that
  the horse alone is worth the entire sum
  i am sure we all thank mr parmenter
  again and again all those who do not
  clearly understand the conditions will
  please come forward

     now thats something like said dick
  burnell turning to his neighbor a watery-
  eyed young man  they ought to have

advertised it in advance then theyd have
had a real crowd

   they wont sell anywhere near all the
tickets replied the young man  you
wait and see if they do a dollar is too
much

  there was another series of raps

   i should have said continued the an-
nouncer  that there will be no blanks
everybody will get something that will
make it seem-er-more proper as well
mr darling the popular druggist has
kindly offered ninety-nine boxes of con-
fectionery at cost to be given to the less
fortunate ones who do not-er-obtain the
horse and-er-carriage come now every
gentleman should buy at least one chance
there arose a bustle and stir at one side
of the hall then there was a measured
tramping of feet and a column of five men
composed of dillonvales most solid citi-
zens marched up to the platform each
deposited a dollar and received a ticket
it was done with the precision and speed
of a bread-line and it was so evidently
planned-that is the planning was so evi-
dent to dick burnell-that he gasped with
appreciative delight

  gee they know the game he said
to himself  those fellers are shillabers
but they did it rotten they ought to
have straggled up kind of slow from dif-
ferent parts of the hall

  a few other men came forward with
their precious dollars and got tickets
there was an uneasy stirring throughout
the room low whispers were audible to
dick

  a dollars too much

   sh-h-h maybe parmenter  draw the
horse himself

   if the price was lower they could sell
more

 thump thump thump the an-
nouncer proclaimed

   please dont be backward gentlemen
remember its in a good cause and there
are no blanks step forward gentlemen
but the gentlemen showed little inclina-
tion to step forward indeed they showed
much more of a disposition to step back-
ward out of the range of seduction

iv

  dick burnell elbowed his way up to
the front and bought two tickets one
lone imitator followed suit though buying
but one ticket

the lesser fleas



  then there was a long dull painful
pause the announcer rapped and rapped
again but enthusiasm was dead

   dont let it be a failure pleaded the
announcer  remember mr parmenters
generosity-and mr darlings we need
the money terribly

  there was no reply to the appeal the
sale had come to one of those impasses so
well known to dick many a time on the
fair-grounds he had felt the chill breath
of the same evil spirit

  dick shifted uneasily back and forth
he itched to jump to the front seize that
stick of fire-wood rap for attention and
sell those tickets he had a wild idea of
offering his services but he didnt dare
to do it

   must it be a failure pleaded the an-
nouncer  dont you think you could
afford one chance gentlemen-and ladies
i must not forget the ladies

  it was too much for dick burnell he
was clenching his fists in excitement

  pikers he was snarling under his
breath  pikers tightwads loosen
up you yokels

  he had made up his mind suddenly
the horse and carriage-they would not be
so bad he could drive across country to
the remaining fairs save mileage and have
some fun he could sell them at the last
fair of the season and get something out
of them anyway

   how many tickets have you sold
cried dick in a loud voice that turned
every head toward him

   sixteen replied perkins the young
hand-shaker

   ill take the rest of them said dick
 heres your money

  the crowd parted as he sprang forward
with an air of conscious superiority
dick took a roll of bills from his pocket
and skinned off the necessary eighty-four
dollars it left the roll sadly emaciated
to be sure but the effect on the spectators
was galvanic mr perkins of perkins 
son took the money gingerly as if he felt
that there was something wrong about it
he swept up the remaining tickets and
passed them over

  dick glanced around every pair of
eyes was fixed on him over at the right
he saw the freckled-faced youth to whom
he had returned the embezzled funds point-
ing a finger at him and talking volubly to
his neighbor

   dont you know who that feller is
the boy was saying gurgling with excite-
ment at being able to impart sensational
information  thats the feller that stuck
a lot of people out on the fair-grounds to-
day didnt i see him raking in money
just as fast as folks could hand it over
yes sirree hes a regular gambler that
feller is no wonder hes got money to
chuck away

   the way you talk i guess he trimmed
you suggested somebody

   me snorted the virtuous lad with the
freckles  huh i got more sense than to
play them games

   i dont think i remember your name
said mr perkins poising a pencil over a
long sheet of paper

   burnell - richard burnell replied
dick

   ah yes i recall now a stranger you
said i guess youve saved the day mr
burnell you fairly took our breath away
though

   when i plunge i plunge replied
dick  these little piking bets make me
tired

  a quick flush overspread mr perkinss
cheeks the word  bet  was rather ill-
chosen but dick with the perfectly honest
spirit of the gambler never suspected that
he had said anything inept he stuck his
hands nonchalantly into his trouser-pockets
and fed himself liberally upon his new
popularity lie had shown em there
was one sport in the room anyway now
let others come to the front

  it couldnt be said that the holders of
the other sixteen numbers were pleased
however they had evidently hoped that
many of the tickets would remain unsold
thus increasing their own chances of draw-
ing the prize one or two of them glared
at dick as if he had committed some
strange crime but against this mr bur-
nell had the pleasant consciousness that a
number of young women were looking at
him with the curious admiration justly due
to a man who can show eighty-four dollars
and spend it like a prince

  there was a wait of about five minutes
before the drawing of the important ticket
could be effected the crowd hung around
the platform though dick retreated to the
rear one or two of the younger men came
up to him and offered congratulations

  youre a sport all right hope vou
win




munseys magazine

    i guess that took the wind out of the
shellbacks all right

   say got any more where that came
from

    what are you going to do - start a
livery-stable

   the announcer came out and rapped for
order

    the winning ticket he called  is
no  who has no 

   dick had so many tickets that he hadnt
even looked at them he took them out
of his pocket and put them in his hat
throwing out one after another suddenly
he smiled held up a card and said

    ive got it

  a murmur of relief ran through the
crowd

    please to step forward called the an-
nouncer when dick approached the plat-
form he leaned over and asked your
name

    burnell replied dick rather savage-
ly he had given his name so many times
that it sounded more or less idiotic when
he uttered it

    mr burchell

    yes replied dick peevishly

    mr burchell wins the horse and car-
riage came the announcement mr
burchell holds ticket no  and is the
fortunate man i am glad to present him
with this slip of paper which is an order
for the prize the horse has been left with
peter dubois the blacksmith any one
will point out his shop to you sir i am
sure we all congratulate you

   thanks replied dick taking the
paper

    you are also entitled to eighty-four
boxes of confectionery i believe mr
burchell here they are on the edge of
the platform

   dick looked at the boxes and grinned
broadly they were the sample boxes
which generally retail at ten cents and
probably cost the storekeeper five or six
cents apiece

   just like my jewelry thought dick
remembering his own consolation stick-
pins that cost him two dollars a gross
and permitted him truthfully to say that
he had no blanks in his little game

    i never use candy said dick  pass
it round to the kids the horse and car-
riage is all i need much obliged wheres
peter dubois anyway

    youll find him in the rear of the shoe-

store hell deliver on receipt of the order
you have

    well ive got it said dick to himself
 i guess i can make some use of it

   dick went over to the side of the hall
found a chair and sat down he looked
contentedly around at the people

   good people he thought  but
theyve got no nerve when theyve spent
a dollar and a quarter they want to go
home thats the reason they never get
anywhere-never do anything big they
just pike along pike along

   excuseme said a hollow uncertain
voice beside him

   dick turned quickly it was the min-
ister standing there with a red face and
nervous excited manner

   mr bur-

    - nell supplied dick grimly

    mr burnell may i ask what your busi-
ness is

   dicks studied poise did not prevent him
thus suddenly accosted from showing a
slight agitation

   why he asked  what difference
does it make

    i am informed went on the minister
with the air of a man who has a painful
task to perform  that you were at the
fair-grounds to-day with a kind of business
which-if i may say so-is not very nice
er-illegal i might say i didnt see you
myself i am so informed thats all

    i run a little game replied dick un-
comfortably  its no worse-

    really we dont discuss that point
was the reply to tell you the truth
this is a very hard position for me-very
if i consulted my own feelings i should
say nothing about it i believe but there
are a number of very fine ladies present
who wish me to say-that ij you remain
here they will leave the hall may i trust
to your discretion mr bur-er-

  i he grim smile was gone from dick
burnells lips his face was as crimson as
that of the ministers a hundred angrv
retorts came into his mind and he had to
shut his teeth hard to keep them back
he looked around at the people he could
see plainly that every one understood what
was going on-that it had been talked over
in advance

    in regard to the money you have just
spent with us continued the minister  it
is my wish that it should be returned to

rrt  
the lesser fleas

   not on your life said dick breathing
hard what do you take me for -a
squealer goodnight

  he felt a hand laid on his shoulder as if
the other man had something further to
say he paid no attention

   what do you know about that he
said aloud when he reached the street
 now what do you know about that

v

  in the morning dick felt better he
reasoned it out pretty well for a young
man whose pride had been so wounded

   you cant blame them he said to
himself  my game does look pretty rot-
ten to them i suppose anyway ive got
the horse and outfit if i can get started
by ten oclock i can get into east dur-
ham to-night in time for the fair to-
morrow

  he lost no time getting to the shop of
peter dubois the big muscular figure of
the blacksmith loomed up before him in
the doorway

   heres an order for the horse and car-
riage they raffled at the sale last night
said dick  got em ready hurry up
and ill buy you a nice spreading chestnut-
tree

  peter didnt move he leaned against
the forge and began to send forth peals of
laughter holding both sides with his hands

 is this a fit or has something funny
been said exclaimed dick impatiently

   i ver sorry for you replied peter with
a throb in his chest that belied his words
 i ver sorry you in ver hard luck
meester

   embalm the sorrow and produce the
horse said dick

   ho ho shouted peter you take
my money my seventy-five cents yester-
day-just like that  he said snapping hts
fingers  but now i laugh two dollar
worth iio ho dat hoss she die las
night 

  dick winced he grasped at a rack of
horseshoes for support then as he re-
covered his balance he asked with a cymcal
smile repeating peters words as he had
heard them

   dat hoss she die las night did she

  peter nodded

   an nudder ting is he added  i
shoe her yestey-bran-new shoes i have
to ask you to take de carcass away and
pay me one dollar and quarter for shoes
ver sorry you come out in de yard and
i show you de hoss

   never mind about that pete said
mr burnell still smiling grimly  she
was probably a good horse in her day
tell mr parmenter for me that he is one
very fly gentleman tell him he ought to
be running a shell-game you can keep
the carriage to pay you for the shoes have
a cigar pete have two cigars i got to
be going now to catch that next train
down-country

   would you believe

 would you believe because the mocking-birds
 pour out their song in sweet melodious notes

 that other birds should strain their little throats
 to put lheir glad hearts into liquid words

 would you believe because the spring sunshine
 first in the woods a blue-eyed violet found

 that all the other flowers below the ground
 should hide their heads in sadness to repine

 would you believe because the petals fell
 from the red rose and left it standing bare

 that all the other flowers growinn there
 should bow their heads and shed their bloom as well

women i have loved

a reply to the article men i have loved published
in munseys magazine for november

y	dear girl i have read your
confession am i to feel
honored by the fact that of
the seven men you have loved
i am the seventh and hence
the latest i do not feel
honored i merely feel enumerated

  you say you find yourself an engrossing
subject for contemplation i too am ego-
tistic perhaps that is one reason why
your seventh affair is not destined to be
your last we are in that particular too
much alike two self-contemplating peo-
ple side by side be they ever so close are
much like parallel lines-they never meet
i am not one of the dry professors who
assert that parallel lines meet in infinity
i am a lawyer and demand witnesses

  you accuse me of being the most unen-
thusiastic man you ever knew and suspect
me of being emotionally as well as physic-
ally indolent you say that you could not
understand me that i baffled you that i
was a jig-saw puzzle which defied putting
together you were fascinated in probing
for something from which you could strike
a spark and you have a premonition that
you will keep on hurling yourself against
the opaque wall that i am until you are
battered into a hopeless mass of spinster-
hood-or until the wall yields

  perhaps you fancy that while i may not
quite forgive the accusation of indolence
i may yet relent because of the flattery in
your inability to understand me but if
such is your fancy you are sadly mistaken
the one thing unforgivable is that you
should fail to understand me that may
be flattery before marriage but afterward
it would come to life in the form of little
domestic scenes - in which for example
the wife fails to understand why the hus-
band has come home a bit late

   but my dear the husband says  if
you will only allow me to explain myself-

  this he cannot do because the wife is
weeping now i refuse to be an inex-
plicable husband and i have a natural
antipathy to explanations -an antipathy
which might render me too  indolent  to
explain myself did it ever occur to you
my dear nell that the difference between
not understanding and misunderstanding is
perilously small a wedding certificate
would make them synonymous

  they say that all is fair in love and war
but the fact that all is fair does not neces-
sarily mean that it is good strategy so i
should hate to have you continue to hurl
yourself against my opaque wall have
you read of the masterly retreats of the
present war

  i like you for your evident belief that
there is no reason why a woman should not
court in much the same way as a man may
but after all it was a caveman who wrote
that  faint heart neer won fair lady do
you remember what robert louis steven-
son said about the  fine solid sort of man
who goes on from snub to snub   
amid the astonished consideration of men
and angels until he has a favorable an-
swer he thought you will recall that
 marriages in which one of the parties
has been thus battered into consent scarce-
ly form agreeable subjects for meditation
perhaps you answer that i never
snubbed you no i was too chivalrous i
merely lapsed into  emotional indolence
i fear that i shall appear cruel unless
i become even more heartless it can
scarcely have dawned upon you that in the
conclusion of your confession you gave
yourself away but you did after de-
claring that you valued all your seven ex-
periences and were educated by them
you wrote the fatal words

  have i not that much more finesse in loving
  you cannot escape those telltale words

m


women i have loved



  they fell too easily and too unconsciously
  from your pen so love with you was a
  game and the man was the opponent
  whose defense you tried to destroy by
  finesse

    i confess to retaining something of the
  old notion that love is a matter of choos-
  ing a partner rather than a matter of
  finessing against an opponent you see i
  always suspected that you were playing a
  game and as i was not particularly fond
  of the game i insisted on being the dum-
  my- emotionally as well as physically
  indolent

   do you want to know the solution of
 the jig-saw puzzle that you found me to
 be it is very simple there are three
 girls who have taken the trouble to find
 the solution a few others perhaps have
 fitted together two or three of the pieces
 into a fleeting caress but they are for-
 gotten

    the first of the three was lillian i
 was a sophomore in college lillian was
 nineteen and i was twenty she was a
 rather frail girl but very sweet and lov-
 able i gazed at her i think much as an
 owl would have gazed and said very little
 our god of love was not blind but he was
 a bit dumb we understood each other
 perfectly-there was not much to under-
 stand-and finding little to talk about
 we used to read together the classics of
 english literature she had very little
 sense of humor i fear and as i write this
 i am unable to see how i could have had
 any at all

    i have often recalled with a smile my
 occasional misgivings about our speech-
 lessness i used to jot down subjects for
 conversation in a note-book at which i
 would give a parting glance when i was
 about to call i found difficulty in leading
 up to the subjects and rather envied the
 clergyman who could bluntly read a text
 and sail in but the conclusion was easy
 lillian expressed a genuine but monosyl-
 labic agreement with my sentiments and
 the exhausted subject died we preferred
 silence to commonplaces and we seemed
 to have no other alternative-except our
 classics to which we precipitately fled

    though not a conversationalist lillian
  was far from stupid she had a well-
  regulated mathematical mind nothing
  could be more even than the even tenor of
   her way i fancy that had we married
  she would have invested her entire love

for me in a life-income policy yielding a
conservative and unvarying three per cent

  at the end of my senior year we be-
came engaged looking forward hopefully
to the termination of a year of teaching
and three years of graduate study which i
had planned my year of teaching was in
a coeducational preparatory school in the
far west

  the brightest girl in the school was a
lass of fifteen named evelyn she was a
beautiful youngster with a spirit and vi-
tality that manifested itself no less in her
restless young mind than in her slender
and girlishly athletic figure her eyes i
have never forgotten they sparkled with
an intelligence that was always alert with
a sense of humor that seemed to be con-
tinually on the trail of something and at
the same time with a tenderness which i
have always thought was very remarkable
in so young a girl

  like lillian she was capable at mathe-
matics but unlike lillian i think she
was fonder of misapplied than of applied
mathematics i took an affectionate in-
terest in the girl which i being twenty-
two imagined was pedagogical

  the year was soon over and i went to
the harvard law school through my
three years there i continued to write to
lillian and i continued to think of eve-
lyn i pictured her as i imagined she
would have developed

  finally after an absence of three years
i wrote her a half-humorous reminiscent
letter her reply came i think by return
mail as i read her letter i could see her
eyes laughing and tender she also un-
derstood me she seemed to know in-
tuitively that i had never forgotten her
and to my reminiscences she added others
and said

  you see i remember every little thing

  i learned that a lass could be a rather
knowing woman even at fifteen-if the
lass was evelyn

  i saw lillian occasionally and we con-
scientiously tried some sort of artificial
respiration but our love was past resusci-
tation and eventually two boxes of re-
turned presents passed each other on their
mournful way

  i finished my legal studies and had es-
tablished myself in new york when some
two years later evelyn came east to make
a visit she was all that i had pictured


munseys magazine

frankly i wanted to tell her that i loved
her but i think my experience with lil-
lian had made me hypercritical and over-
cautious however i loved her and i
have no doubt she knew it and i confess
that the belief that my love was not alto-
gether unreturned has often given me mo-
ments of regretful sadness but the fact
remains that i met frances-and that fact
 cannot regret

  my affair with lillian was a boys love
for a girl my affair with evelyn was a
mans love for a girl my affair with
frances was a mans love for a woman

  not to mention the fact that they were
all blondes the three had this in common
-they understood me and knew intuitive-
ly that in the  jig-saw puzzle  of my
affections there was a place into which
they could fit so they crept in confident
of their right of possession and inci-
dentally solved the jig-saw puzzle by
themselves supplying the missing master-
piece

  i	have known but one man for whom i
have felt a positive affection and i think
it was due to the charm of a boyish frank-
ness and genuineness that were absolute
and unvarying and never lost for an in-
stant because they were a part of him
frances had a boyish profile and the same
boyish charm of utter genuineness

  she had a sense of humor almost too
keen to seem feminine-forgive me-
and sometimes a touch of fire in her eyes
which i fancy she inherited from spanish
skies with her love of life her hobby

for latest styles and latest dancing steps-
she somehow adopted them without imi-
tating them - and with her occasional
cigarette you would probably at first call
her a typical product of modern times
but you would be missing the fact that she
was through it all a wonderfully simple
elemental woman typical of all times

  there is a beautiful piece of sculpture
called  life which represents a man and
a woman holding in their arms a babe
the proud stern lines of the mans face
seem softened for the moment as he pauses
in the struggle of life and looks down in
humble awe at the babe the womans
face is upturned her head bends slightly
toward the mans her eyes seem almost
closed and on her face one reads the
longing the passion and the mystery that
lie in the birth of a child-her child it is
because i have seen that expression of a
true womans longing made in the sim-
plicity and beauty of an almost boyish
frankness that i am in love

  you see it isnt so much a matter of
finesse as the utter absence of finesse that
solves the jig-saw puzzle it is its very
simplicity that baffled you i think you
will forgive me nell for this letter be-
cause as a matter of fact however little
it may flatter me you never really loved
me or you would not have resorted to
finesse - you were merely curious and
will you let me come to see you some eve-
ning and talk to you - probably about
frances-while you tell me about number
eight

  evening song

 go day thou restless rover

 forever vain thy quest
 to match my hearts sole guest
 theres nothing to discover
 till he returns-my lover

 and night thy starry skies
 mysterious and splendid

 with dread and beauty blended 
 affright me sore who am not wise
 unless i dream of his dear eyes

 soothe time thy changing chime
 when he is far-my heart -

 how tedious thou art

 when he is near there is no rime
 to compass tby glad fleetness time

 whats the
 best thing
 in town

you see all the

plays and ought to know all about it
this question is frequently put to a
dramatic editor and a reply isnt the
simple matter it might seem the query is
usually propounded by somebody who
plans to go to the theater and wishes to
make certain he wont waste his money
but whats one mans meat you know may
be anothers poison and more than one
piece that was praised extravagantly early
in the season is already in the storehouse

  at this writing the new york theater at
which seats are most in demand is the
globe where montgomery and stone are
disporting themselves in  chin-chin yet
one would hesitate to proclaim this hodge-
podge of tunes and nonsense as  the best
thing in town suppose then one goes
by the reputation of the author in that
case undoubtedly the playwright with
the widest vogue is the man who wrote
 twelfth night in which ellen terrys
niece phyllis neilson-terry recently made
her new york debut but shakespeare
nowadays is caviar to most of the public
thus the question propounded above usual-
ly calls for the counter query

   which way does your taste run-to-
ward comedy crime or a cry-fest

  it is into these three classes that the

      

                   broadway offerings
of the present win-
ter would appear
most readily to fall
-that is excluding the musical produc-
tions of which at the outset there was a
decided paucity but election-time saw a
rush of new candidates for lyric favor and
novembers third week brought grand opera
once more to the metropolitan where it
had been feared silence might reign owing
to the caging of the song-birds on the other
side by the war

  the strict neutrality enjoined by the
president was observed in the selection of
the first three operas of the new york
season that for the opening night was
the italian  masked ball  of verdi fol-
lowed by the german  lohengrin  of
wagner this in turn by the french  car-
men  of bizet with geraldine farrar for
the first time in the name-part caruso is
here again and all the indications point to
a prosperous season in the buff-colored
temple of fashion and song-the barometer
in a sense of manhattans prosperity

  andreas dippel who was for years a
very useful tenor at the metropolitan and
who has lately been devoting himself to
opera management in chicago and phila-
delphia has now founded the dippel opera
comique company he selected for the
inaugural work charles cuvilliers  the
lilac domino which would have justified


munseys magazine

its existence if it had done no more than
bring forward eleanor painter and wilfrid
douthitt

  miss painter has both a good voice and
the temperament to wed it happily to im-
personation she is an omaha girl still in
her early twenties she was riding on
horseback at colorado springs at the same
time exercising her voice when two women
with operatic connections chanced to over-
hear her as a result they put her in the
path for an operatic training which she
obtained in germany wilfrid douthitt is
an english barytone who i am told had
the distinction of being the first man to
fill the post of  principal boy  in a drury
lane pantomime-a role that usually falls
to a member of the fair sex so well was
he liked in the innovation that he was re-
tained at the lane for two seasons

  as to  the lilac domino  itself the
music is in large measure charming it has
form and color and tunefulness and there
is a second-act climax that really stirs one
the third act is laid in nice at carnival-
time and kinemacolor motion pictures are
happily requisitioned to lead up to its
opening scene

  another musical play in which people
practically new to broadway made decided
hits is  the only girl reviewed last
month of course it is much more diffi-
cult to cast a production with unknown
performers than with players who have es-
tablished a reputation in certain lines joe

bates and marie doro

  it was mr gillette by the way who
gave miss doro her first chance at a big
part just ten years ago when she was
brought back from london-where she had
been appearing with willie collier in the
farce  the dictator -to enact the title-
role with gillette in his play  clarice
she won her way up via musical comedy
her real name is marie stuart and her
home was in kansas city where she ac-
quired such a reputation as a child actress
that it was a natural drift that sent her into
amateur theatricals and thence to the regu-
lar stage the winter of iyo saw her a
star in the first w j locke story to be
dramatized  the morals of marcus she
is petite and her large pathetic eyes help
to make her an ideal dora in the sardou
play among her accomplishments miss
doro numbers the composing of popular
songs one of them  doggie in our
yard hattie williams sang with great
success some years since in  the little
cherub

  like so many members of the profession
who reach the top of the ladder blanche
bates hails from the pacific side of the
continent to get away from there where
she was in the frawley stock she saved
up a hundred and fifty dollars and headed
for new york she had determined to
hunt for a job on broadway which at that
time was not quite so white a way as en-
terprising tire and tooth-brush manufac-
turers have since combined to make it
she wrote for an appointment with augus-
tin daly the david belasco of his period
but her savings dwindled as days went and
mails came without bringing any reply
from him at length in desperation she
took her courage in both hands and set out
to beard the lion in his den

  to apply this metaphor to mr daly is
something more than a mere figure of
speech tales of his formidable curtness
were very little exaggerated his reserve
the wall he built about himself were more
than a pose for instance i distinctly re-
call the chain that barred off one end of a
sofa in dalys lobby where the manager
liked to seat himself to watch the assem-
bling of his audiences he was determined
to make sure that no one else should oc-
cupy that particular corner

from  phoionath h white new york-cotxriehted by charles frohmnn

  the determined girl from oregon waited
in the outer office from nine oclock in the
morning without a bite of lunch until
three in the afternoon then mr daly
poked his head out of his den surveyed
the candidate asked a few questions and
finally told her that if she thought she
could live on thirty-five dollars a week she
might consider herself engaged

   i was to report on the following mon-
day said miss bates in telling about her
experiences  when i did so i discovered
that i had been billed to appear as bianca
in  the taming of the shrew  that very

night and i had never seen the play to
say nothing of never having acted in it
february   is doubtless marked
with a white stone in miss batess memory
it was on this date that she appeared as
countess mirtza charkofj leader of the
diamond gang in  the great ruby a
drury lane melodrama which mr daly
had decided to put upon the stage hitherto
dedicated to shakespeare and light come-
dy either with or without music he
found his justification for the revolutionary
departure in the enormous success the piece
achieved and miss bates so far over-
the stage



shadowed ada rehan that next day her
name was on every playgoers lips

   when marcia van dresser played the
 countess on the second night the rumor
 ran that miss re-

  hans jealousy of the
 newcomers hit had
 caused mr daly to
 drop her from the
 company as a mat-
 ter of fact the split
 occurred over quite
 another matter-the
 question of gowns

 miss bates wanted
 to wear her own and
 mr daly wished
 otherwise and be-
 fore miss bates went
 on in  the great
 ruby it seems she
 had promised the
 lieblers to create for
 them milady in
  the three muske-
 teers which she did
 soon after leaving
 dalys

   the following year
 found her with be-
 lasco in one of the
 very few failures that
 astute manager has
 registered this was
  naughty anthony to
 which an afterpiece was soon
 added and in the latter miss
 bates swept into another suc-
 cess - her cho - cho san in
  mme butterfly the play-
 let by john luther long
 afterward expanded into puc-
 cinis famous opera this
 paved the way for her yo-
 san in  the darling of the
 gods two years later the
 intervening season being de-
 voted to cigarette in  un-
 der two flags miss
 bates is also widely known
 in the name-part of  the
 girl of the golden west

in  she married george creel a
former dramatic critic who was then po-
lice commissioner of denver she still re-
tains her home in the vicinity of ossining

  one of the oddities in this strange theat-
rical season was the fate meted out to two
plays put on at the hudson theater rose
stahl arrived there with a new vehicle  a
perfect lady written for her by chan-
ning pollock and rennold wolf the
metropolitan critics tore it to pieces even
more fiercely than they did  the chorus
lady when that well-remembered comedy
introduced this clever actress to broadway
on september i   a perfect lady 
played twenty-three times in new york
and then went on the road where i under-
stand it is doing well

  it permits miss stahl once more to im-
personate an actress this time of the bur-
lesque order but she mingles slang and
moral precepts in about equal proportions
reforms the hard man of the town teaches
the minister how to fill his pews and ends
by marrying him of course it is miss
stahls inimitable fashion of delivering both
the precepts and the slang that will keep
her new posters on the fences

   a perfect lady  was followed at the
hudson by  the big idea this time
all the notices were good and the people
who saw the play seemed to like it but
nevertheless the audiences were so slender
that it was taken off after twenty-five per-
formances and as there was no star in the
cast with a  road  draft touring was not
to be thought of it is possible however
that the piece will have another trial in
chicago during the spring

the girl who really comes from utah

  the many friends she made in  the
pink lady  have hastened to applaud
hazel dawn as a star in  the debutante
a new operetta with music by victor her-
bert miss dawn who is actually a girl
from utah has lost none of her good looks

and witching ways and i am sure there
will be many in her audiences who will be
quite ready to comply with her request to
 take me home with you her catchy
number in the first act

  the piece is elaborately put on and in
her support miss dawn has such excellent
material as robert j pitkin for an irish
lieutenant in the british navy will west
-who sang  truly rural  in  the dol-
lar princess  - as a composer of cubist
music and maude odell who was the
 terribly temperamental  seeress in  lit-
tle boy blue playing opposite miss
dawn we find the breezy wilmuth merkyl
last season with  sari a young man who
seems to enter into his work with real
enthusiasm

  the castles on the stage again

  	watch your step  promises to dupli-
cate the knock-out hit of  chin-chin
why shouldnt it with the rag-time music
of irving berlin and a cast including the
castles frank tinney and elizabeth mur-
ray to say nothing of charles king and
elizabeth brice there are also sallie
fisher and harry kelly for good measure
and harry ellis with a really wonderful
voice as the ghost of verdi to protest
against the rag-timing of his tunes

  the slogan  made in america  appears
under the classification of the piece which
is set down as  a syncopated musical
show charles dillingham the producer
may boast that not only is the offering
made on this side of the atlantic but that
the scenes are all laid here as well and that
the only englishman in the cast is vernon
castle

  mr castle seems delighted to be back on
the boards again and works like a trojan
not only does he dance with much energy
and make a multiplex drummer of himself
to help out elizabeth murray in her
 minstrel parade but he takes a stage
fall which recalls the fact that it was his
acrobatics and not his terpsichorean abili-
ties that first impressed the public when
he made his advent in new york this
was in may  when he appeared as
souse berry lushmore in the lew fields
production of  the midnight sons  at
the broadway theater it was at that
time charles darnton said of him in the
evening world

  that strange assortment of legs and arms
vernon castle got badly tangled up with him-
the stage



self the way he turns himself out of a door is
quite the newest thing in exits hes a weird
specimen not exactly funny but certainly gro-
tesque has it ever occurred to you that he
would be an extremely difficult person to bury

   later in the same year young castle was
with lew fields at the herald square as
the hon algernon clymber in  old
dutch the following summer we find him
still with mr fields at the same theater as
oxford tig fie in  summer widowers in
 he married an american bride with
whom he appeared in  the sunshine girl
about a year ago the castles left the stage
and founded a dancing-school or  college
of dance as they prefer to call it

  in  watch your step  mr castle
plays  joseph lily burn who invented the
steps you watch but he is very much him-
self his wife being frankly herself on the
house-bill the same may be said of
charles king who enacts a matinee idol

  frank tinney whom the winter garden
first made famous not only impresses the
orchestra-leader into service for his black-
face fun-making but utilizes mr castle
for a feeder as well  watch your step
by the way is the first full evenings score
by irving berlin who was put on the syn-
copated map by his  alexanders rag-
time band heis also guilty of  when
the midnight choo-choo leaves for ala-
bam and countless others of their sort

always a good season for a good play

  although mary boland was john drews
leading woman for four years her three
seasons in stock-at cincinnati nashville
los angeles and providence at various
periods in her earlier days-probably did
more to give her the versatility that she
displays in  my ladys dress the lat-
ter piece did not last the winter out in
new york but its managers promise a re-
turn to town in the spring

   theatrical folk are making all kinds of
complaints about the present season but
it is to be noticed that when they produce
a play that the public wants to see neither
the war in europe nor the business situa-
tion here puts the clasp on the pocketbooks
of theatergoers

   i	he brady-brand melodrama  life  is
an expensive production and the top price
for seats at the manhattan opera-house is
a dollar and fifty cents but new yorkers
realize that they get full value for money
expended in going to see it and the run

     

seems likely to continue until spring i
was chatting with the author thompson
buchanan about this the first melodrama
he ever wrote

    no he said in answer to my question
 i did not try to fit my story around cer-
tain big effects mr brady and i thought
of the story first and the scenic stunts just
naturally cropped up in the path of its de-
velopment as to the use of motion pic-
tures to carry on the plot at certain points
this expedient had occurred to me previ-
ously but in mulling it over i had promised
myself to use them some time in farce

some people in  chin-chin 

   it was failure to pass her third-year ex-
amination at a chicago high school that
sent helen falconer on the stage you can
see her in the picture with douglas steven-
son on page  of this number he is the
aladdin in chin-chin and she the
violet bond with whom he falls in love

  miss falconer was fortunate enough to
know somebody connected with the thea-
ter none other than george lederer who
introduced her to charles b dillingham
this manager was then casting  the old
town an early montgomery and stone
vehicle and gave the schoolgirl a part in it
she made good and got a better one in
 the lady of the slipper  and when
elsie janis suddenly deserted the show to
go to london miss falconer was promoted
to her place as cinderella mr stevenson
was also in this piece as crovm prince
maximilian

   fred stones bareback riding in  chin-
chin  must remind him of his first essay
in the amusement business when he did a
brother act with eddie stone his
younger brother in a small wagon show
which went by the name of burr robbins
circus he fell in with dave montgomery
in st joseph missouri where they formed
a partnership for song and dance work
starting out with haverlys minstrels a
bonanza in black face

   they were in vaudeville at keiths thea-
ter boston when charles frohman en-
gaged them to go with edna may in  the
girl from up there the play failed but
montgomery and stone were broadway
favorites from that time they were first
starred in  the wizard of oz with stone
as the scarecrow and montgomery as the
tin woodman later they passed under
the dillingham management in  the red

by grace of star and comedian

  in the wake of last seasons  sari 
comes  suzi a comedy operetta of hun-
garian source but name and origin are
about the only points of similarity in-
terest in the story of  suzi  is a negli-
gible quantity and beyond some charming
melodies by aladar renyi the personal ap-
peal of the star jose collins and the
quaint humor of the comedian tom mc-
naughton there is little to say for the new
piece

  miss collins who began with the win-
ter garden forces and suddenly blossomed
into full flower with a casino show is the
daughter of a well-known mother the lot-
tie collins of the english music-halls who
used to sing  tarara-boom-de-ay  in the
early nineties jose collins has inherited
her mothers temperament plus a higher
degree of vocal ability a year ago she-was
with the ziegfeld follies of 

  robert evett the leading man in  su-
zi has been singing tenor roles in london
musical shows for about ten years tom
mcnaughton yet another of the host of
british players who are now on this side
came over first if i mistake not to creae
the part of roland with christie mac-
donald in  the spring maid it was
in this that he sang the now famous novelty
song punctuated with orchestral effects
 the three trees

  christie macdonald by the way is now
a wife and mother having married a new
york manufacturer in  she has re-
tired to private life and lives with her hus-
band on upper riverside drive

  erecting a pulpit at the princess

  nobly has the princess theater risen
above the fiasco of its first bill for the
season after a period of closed doors for
rehearsals the company of which hol-
brook blinn is director presented a quartet
of offerings which appealed strongly to the
interest of the new york public

  in one case something more than this
might fairly be said  across the border
by beulah marie dix coauthor of  the
road to yesterday is not only an inter-
esting play but the most effective sermon
against war that has yet been preached
for this reason it falls short in some re-
spects as a drama too much time is spent

in driving its points home but one does
not soon forget the awe-inspiring mysticism
of the second episode laid in  the place of
quiet where the junior lieutenant slowly
awakes to the fact that he is not merely
wounded but dead and is among people
who are existing in strange fashion  across
the border

  this curious scene shows none of the
signs or symbols one usually associates
with the land beyond the grave it is the
half light the unearthly stillness of the
figures sitting there in the gloom in what
seems to be an ordinary sort of house that
impart the impress of the strange the
supernatural there is just the right de-
gree of light and shade in the impersona-
tion of the junior lieutenant by david
powell who scores heavily in the part he
is a scotsman and was three years with
sir johnston forbes-robertson as the artist
in  the passing of the third floor back
a season or two back he became the hero
in  the yellow jacket

   nettie by george ade the only
comedy in the list despite its title has
only men in the cast and shows how three
impressionable hearts behind masculine
waistcoats are  done  by a demure young
woman posing as the most circumspect of
music students

  the fog by frederick truesdell an
actor in  on trial is a gruesome story
of jealousy in the back room of a small
london shop there is however a delight-
ful twist at the end when mr blinn as
the husband having strangled the wrong
man shouts back from the door to his wife
and her lover

   settle it between you which of you
killed the fellow behind the screen im
going for the police

  strong but almost too harrowing for
representation is  the denial with its
scene laid in the death-house at sing sing
immediately before an electrocution ex-
cellent acting is done in this by geoffrey
stein as the condemned man who refuses
to see a woman claiming to be his mother
but afterward consents only to tell her
that she is mistaken that he is another
man of the same name and that he killed
her boy while the latter was trying to re-
form him after she goes out he breaks
down with a sobbing cry of  mother un-
heard by the woman whom he had just
saved the one pang it was in his power to
spare her

into the hall
the ioth to-day

nan reached for his
on the rack

   so it is unseemly weather for the
season-too cold he thrust his arms into
his coat-sleeves and without a glance at
his wife flung open the front door  dont
wait dinner emmy if im late getting
home

 youll not be late to-night john

   never know deuced lot of work
he slapped his hat upon his head crossed
the piazza and ran down the porch steps
 good-by his wife called after him
the bang of the front gate drowned the
words mrs wright sighed and dabbed
her eyes with her handkerchief

   why the leak ma called a voice
from the dining-room

  mrs wright transferred the hand-
kerchief to her nose

   i believe ive a touch of hay-fever
stephen it usually comes on about this
time-the icth of october she lingered
over the date

 gee id forgotten it was the ioth
the boy gulped the bit of toast remain-
ing on his plate and made a dash for the
door as he pulled his cap over his ears
his mother caught him by the shoulders

   must you be off so soon dear school
will not begin for an hour

 but the zanesville blues are due in
town early to-day-the ioth he shook
himself free of her  ive got to beat it
she caught him again raising her lips

   oh lets cut out the sloppy stuff ma
im sixteen and - and the other fellows
dont do it

  his mothers hands dropped to her sides
she drew up her small shoulders

   all right stephen if you dont want
me to kiss you any more i-i wont

  the last words caught in her throat
with her handkerchief she covered the
treacherous quivering at the comers of her
mouth

   im off ma good-by

  the door opened and closed again and
emily wright was alone

  how little they need me she mur-
mured  they-they could hire a cook
to take my place

  she walked wearily back to the dining-
room sank into the chair behind the
coffee-pot and with her elbows on the
table and her clasped hands beneath her
chin sat looking absently into space

  she was a small woman her figure
straight and angular as a young boys a
pointed chin accented the triangular lines
of her face with its thin-lipped slightly
dished mouth three fine lines zigzagged
across her forehead and her dark hair was
thickly threaded with gray only her eyes
struck a wrong note in the sedate harmony
of her appearance and they were brown
with golden flecks that suggested strange
fires behind them

  now as she sank into the chair behind
the coffee-pot they were flooded with tears

   they have both forgotten that to-day
is my birthday she said speaking aloud
as people much alone have a habit of
doing

  she shook her head slowly in self-pity
then her attitude relaxed her chin sank
upon her bosom she yielded herself utter-
ly to her hurt feelings while her forefinger
moved absently over the cloth tracing the
figures three and eight again and again

  thirty-eight years old she mur-
mured  a middle-aged woman and-and
a sentimental fool john would say she
laughed bitterly  and i am not to kiss
stevie good-by any more she clenched
her hands  oh it seems as if i could
not stand it - shutting it all up within
myself

muxseys magazine

  as if to relieve the tensity of her feel-
ings she sprang to her feet and went about
the work of clearing the table and washing
the dishes with a sort of eager swiftness

  at ten oclock she took the key of the
r f d box from its hook and went for
the mail there were no letters in the tin
box only a weekly story magazine she
lifted it out pulling off its wrapper as she
turned toward the house the picture on
the cover told her that the principal story
was of the frozen north-a mans story

  she sighed as she settled into the easy
chair by the sitting-room window and
looked over the contents of the magazine

   all of them stories of action and out
of doors she murmured

  she was in no mood for them she
wanted romance

  she turned to the editorial page her eye
skimming the columns of tantalizing ad-
vance notices of stories then on to the
published letters from readers these al-
ways seemed to bring her into touch with
the outside world she read them each
week painstakingly almost as if they were
letters from friends

  this morning one of them specially held
her attention she read and reread it a
soft color swept into her cheeks her prim
mouth took on an upward curve her
brown-flecked eyes glowed under her droop-
ing lashes

  she felt as if somebody had spoken to
her out of the distance she glanced half
guiltily toward the hall then fixed her eyes
again upon the published letter that had so
strangely moved her

  i wish some of your readers would take pity
on me and drop me a line it would sure be
appreciated by a chap who is still young and
awfully homesick and heart-hungry who dares

  the letter had beenwritten from a town
in florida a place that seemed as remote
as the antipodes to untraveled emily
wright

  she closed the magazine on her forefinger
and sat for some minutes lost in reflection
then suddenly she sprang from her chair
and with an air of brisk decision walked to
her desk

   just for this once im going to let my-
self go she said in a lone of finality as
she picked up her pen and began to write

  noon found her still at her task her
color hectic a lock of loosened hair brush-
ing her cheek she seemed but half awake

  as she got lunch for stephen who gulped
his food and was off again

   at two oclock she finished her letter
signed it and walked with it to the village
post-office as the metallic flap of the
mail-box closed upon it irrevocably she felt
a spiritual relaxation she went home
slowly humming softly to herself

   at six oclock john wright getting back
from the city earlier than usual found her
waiting for him at the gate she had put
on a white muslin dress and had thrust a
blazing zinnia into her hair about her
thin shoulders she had thrown a white
crocheted shawl

    for goodness sake emmy her hus-
band scolded as he hurried up to her  are
you trying to get pneumonia hanging over
the gate in fourth of july clothes at this
time of the year get into the house and
put on something warm

   as she crossed the piazza stephen burst
from around the corner

  hello ma he shouted what are
you all dolled up for say theres a zinnia
sticking in your hair

  emily wright threw the flower away
went into the house and put on a heavy
dress the color had faded from her face
the curly corners of her mouth straight-
ened

ii

   a week later emily wright found a let-
ter in the mail-box addressed to  miss
emily wright r f d no  richfield
it was postmarked trenton florida

   why-why he thinks me unmarried
she whispered as she t -re open the envelope
and pulled out the single sheet of paper it
contained she read

dear miss wright

   your talk listened good to me i know a whole
 lot about the inside of you now but give me a
 line on the outside are your eyes blue or brown 
 what color is your hair id sure like a photo-
 graph if youve got the nerve to send me one a
 snap-shot or any old thing will do as you see
 im not much of a letter-writer but dont let
 that make any difference with your letters to me
 i can hardly wail for the next

   if you say the word ill fire alone a photo-
 graph of myself i am twenty-four years old
 and only passably good-looking

yours on the square

harry bedford

  emily wright mailed a photograph to
trenton that afternoon it had come in a
his wifes love-affair



       silver frame she had bought two years be-
       fore in which to place a picturc of stephen
       she supposed it was a portrait of some
       actress and hoped that harry bedford
       would not recognize it as such she chose
       it from several similar photographs because
       the pose was simple on the back of it she
       wrote

          hair and eyes brown i am not as pretty as
        this picture

         three days later she posted her second
       letter to florida as before the writing
       of it acted like a safety-valve she felt
       relaxed strangely at peace with the world
       when it was done and in the mean time
       she was more than ever thoughtful of the
       material comforts of her son and husband

           you seem to have kind of settled down
        emmy john wright remarked one morn-
        ing as she held his coat for him  i
        havent seen any sign of nerves for almost
        a month and youre eating better

         mas getting fat added stephen
       shes getting as chesty as mrs biddle

          its a fact said john wright and
       pinched his wifes cheek it was the near-
       est he had come to a caress in years

         emily wright went about her work that

	morning with a light heart she merely
      glanced at the package of snap-shots that
      she found in the mail-box showing a young
      man in a sombrero and light flannels doing
      various things in an orange-grove as she
      dropped them into her desk drawer she
      felt a vague sense of regret that in future
      she must think of her correspondent in con-
      crete form until then he had been scarce-
      ly more real to her than the hero in a story

         the letter she wrote that afternoon was
       less spontaneous than usual

         as the winter wore on emily wright was
       tempted many times to make a clean breast
       of things to harry bedford but the relief
       of expressing herself to somebody was so
       great that she postponed her confession
       and then one day in early spring the mail
       brought her a startling letter

       dearest emmy

          im starting north on sunday and im going
        to bring you back with me i cant get away
        from the look in your brown eyes they follow
        me about my work i just cant get along with-
        out you girlie youll probably say that i dont
        know you well enough to be really in love with
        you but ill bet i know you better than anybody
        else in the world does for youve driven on the
        snaffle with me since the start and there isnt any
        use your trying to use a curb now ive got to

 have you and youve got to have me so im
 coming after you if i could id start to-morrow
 but i want to paint the bungalow and get every-
 thing spick and span for my little emmy

    this will be my last letter after next week
 we drive double do you get me

your loving

harry

   emily wright finished the letter then sat
 back in her chair trying to think she
 must act and act at once to prevent this
 man from coming to her she would write
 to him but no a letter would not reach
 him in time to-day was friday and he
 was starting on sunday she must wire to
 him first ask him to wait for her letter

   fear beat against her temples made her
 face livid it was impossible she told her-
 self that this mystical far-away person
 had so suddenly become human threaten-
 ing and only three days journey from her

   there was no time to be lost she must
 try as best she could to make bedford un-
 derstand the soul tragedy that had impelled
 her - a middle-aged woman married the
 mother of a grown son-to pour out her
 wretched heartache to an utter stranger
 she must write and get the letter to the
 post-office in time to catch the one-oclock
 mail and on the way back she must tele-
 graph

   she sat down at her desk her pen flew
 over the paper she made a clean breast
 of everything she did not spare herself

  what did she care that sh made herself
 appear despicable faithless a middle-aged
 fool she poured out her heart as she had
 never done to any human being before

   when she had done without stopping to
 read what she had written she put on her
 hat and coat and started for the post-office
 a mile and a half away as she passed the
 station the eleven thirty train from the
 city rumbled in in half an hour stephen
 would come home from school hungry and
 wondering what had become of her her
 feet flew over the ground she arrived at
 the post-office flushed and breathless on
 her way home she stopped at the station
 and sent her telegram

   it was after twelve when she reached
 home again as she opened the gate john
 wright came to the door

   john she gasped feeling suddenly
 faint  what-what is the matter how
 long have you been here

   her terrified eyes were on her husbands
 face


munseys magazine

  she had left that letter in the drawer of
her desk had he seen it did he know

   i came out on the eleven thirty ive
a chance to sell the barker place to a
stamford party im to meet him there at
two oclock

   ill get lunch right away

  emily wrights eyes still searched her
husbands face-that stern impassive face
that never showed an emotion did he
know good heavens did he know

   ive had a bite id better get right
along its a big deal

   all right john she came close to
him raising her face  you-youre not
angry with me john her breath caught
in a sob which she covered with an affected
little cough

   certainly not emmy

  john wright picked up his hat

  john john dont leave me like this
 youre hysterical emily youve over-
exerted yourself sit down and rest before
you get stephens lunch

  the door closed on his substantial back
with clenched hands she waited until she
heard the gate click then she ran to her
desk everything seemed in order except
the sheets of paper that she herself had
scattered over the blotting-pad she
opened the drawer bedfords letter
stared up at her apparently nothing had
been disturbed

  in one corner was the little package of
kodak pictures she ran them over be-
neath her thumb six of them in all as
she did so one dropped into her lap and
she saw for the first time that something
was written on its back

to emmy from her harry

  she tore the picture into a dozen pieces
the others received ihc treatment then
she destroyed the letter

   its fortunate for me that john has no
curiosity she whispered  what would
he have thought if he had seen these

  she gathered up the fragments of letter
and pictures carried them to the kitchen
stove and watched until they had burned
to cinders then she set about getting
lunch for stephen

ill

  three days passed and emily wright
heard nothing from bedford she had in-
quired at the telegraph-office and had been
told that her message had been delivered

this brought a modicum of relief to her
if bedford would only wait as she had
begged in her telegram all would be well
but would he wait the question tor-
mented her day and night

  to make matters worse her husband
announced on monday that he had de-
cided to take a week off from business and
set out a new hedge around the kitchen-
garden

   but-but i thought this was the busy
season in real estate his wife stammered
almost overcome with the shock of the an-
nouncement and swaying a bit as she
grasped the table edge to steady herself

   dont want me around eh rumbled
her husband  i sort of expected youd
like the idea of having me here to help
with the spring cleaning

   oh i do john i do you know im
always glad to have you at home but-but
i wasnt intending to do any house-clean-
ing just yet-not for a month or so until
the weather is more settled and as for
the hedge the frost is hardly out of the
ground yet its early for planting

  her usually soft voice shrilled out the
last words in an ecstasy of nervousness
john wright towered above her his arms
folded his brows drawn down it seemed
to emily that his features had hardened
during the past few days she cowered
before the sternness in his eyes

   your nerves are getting away with you
again em-emily he said

  whirling on his heel he went out of
doors

  it was just before daylight on wednes-
day morning that emily wright was
awakened by the sound of soft footsteps
in the hall she listened somebody was
going stealthily down-stairs she stretched
out her hand the bed next to her own
was empty

   john she called softly

  there was no answer she waited a mo-
ment outside a horse whinnied there
was a sound of footsteps on the graveled
path leading to the porch

   john she called again

  still there was no answer only the sound
of a bolt being shot back in the door down-
stairs

   john what is it who has come

  the front door opened then closed
again there was the roll of wheels in the
road
his wifes love-affair



  emily wright struck a match and light-
ed the night-lamp by her bed the
next moment her husband came into the
room she shrieked and covered her eyes
as she glimpsed the blue barrel of a re-
volver that he carried

   milkman got around an hour earlier
than usual he remarked stolidly thrust-
ing the revolver beneath his pillow  when
i heard him drive up  thought it was one
of those scoundrels whove been lifting
cord-wood in the neighborhood

   and you would have shot him john
whispered his wife

   any sneak who tries stealing from me
will get plugged plumb full of lead emmy
-i warn you of that he blew out the
lamp and climbed into bed  sorry i
disturbed you emmy its still three
hours to breakfast-time and you need all
the sleep you can get

  it seemed to emily wright but a few
moments later that her husbands heavy
breathing told her that he slept

  until rising-time she lay with wide-open
eyes trying to muster the courage to
awaken her husband and tell him the whole
story of her correspondence with harry
bedford but it was useless john wright
was not the man to understand the almost
overwhelming desire for expression that
had first prompted her to write to this
stranger he would be inexorable scathing
she dared not tell him and yet she was
tormented by the thought that he already
knew that he had seen that letter in her
desk

  she did her mornings work in a haze
going repeatedly into the front room to
look down the winding ribbon of road that
led to the village fearful almost to the
point of hysteria whenever she saw an un-
familiar figure approaching

  meanwhile john wright worked uncon-
cernedly in the garden

  at ten oclock when the postman came
emily hurried out to the mail-box but
her husband had thrown down his spade
and before she had a chance to prevent
him he was holding out his hand for the
morning mail

   the florida letter is for the old man
this time mis wright volunteered the
postman grinning and handing an envelope
to john  but you cant complain mis
wright youve been getting most of the
valentines lately

  emily wright felt her knees weaken be-

neath her she caught her husbands arm
but he shook her off and strode into the
house

  somehow she managed to get to the
piazza where she sank weakly down upon
the lowest step and sat hunched forward
unmindful of the cold wind that lashed
her hair into her eyes wondering wonder-
ing what harry bedford had written to
her husband well whatever it was it
served her right there was no excuse for
what she had done and john would
never forgive her that was certain he
might leave her he had reason enough
and stephen-she moaned softly then sat
rigidly erect

   emily

  her husband was calling her

   yes john

  her reply was a mere gasp but she got
to her feet and stood for a moment lean-
ing against the porch pillar there came
a strange sound from within the house it
was like a sigh strangely magnified and
ending in a groan she crossed the thresh-
old then paused in the dining-room door-
way

  john wright sat at the table his face
on his arms which were thrust out straight
in front of him with the fists clenched upon
a twisted roll of something white

  for a moment emily wright stood awe-
struck staring at him then she swept
forward and gathered her husbands head
against her breast her terrified eyes fixed
upon a sheet of paper spread out on the
table beside him on it were scrawled a
few words in the handwriting of harry
bedford

   read the enclosed letter old man and wake up

  emily wright drew in her breath what
did bedford mean what letter had he
sent for her husband to read as she asked
herself the question the head in her arms
was thrown backhand john wrights face
was turned up to hers

   emmy  the word seemed to come
from the depths of him his fingers
closed on her shoulders bruising her flesh
 emily forgive me

   forgive you john you ask me to
forgive you she gasped  why it is i
who must beg of you to forgive me

   no emmy it is i who have been
guilty see he let go of her shoulders
and smoothed out the twisted wisp of
paper she recognized it at once it was


munseys magazine

her last letter to bedford  this is what
you wrote emily listen to it and then
say you will forgive me for what i have
done to you my wife

  his finger ran half-way down the page
then he began to read

   there is no excuse for what i have done mr
bedford i am not trying to make any you
cannot understand it-no man could but per-
haps one day some woman who like myself has
felt the burning need to utter her own soul will
explain to you as i cannot

   when i wrote to you that first letter i was
like a plant that has had no room for its roots to
spread i had become dwarfed shriveled old
before my time for years i had been withering
up just for lack of expression and then one
day i saw your appeal in the magazine with-
out thinking what it might lead to i sat down
and poured out my heart again and again i
wrote to you but believe me it was never really
to you i wrote but to my own husband and my
own boy neither of whom have ever let me say
to them the things that are in me-the real
things that i have said to you

   mr bedford the picture i sent you has noth-
ing to do with me i am an old woman my
hair is streaked with gray my face is lined
with-

  john wrights big hand spread over the
page shutting off the rest of the letter
his other hand reached up and pressed his
wifes cheek against his own and then
for the first time in his life stress of emo-
tion loosened the floodgates of his speech

   emmy my wife it is not true you
are not old he stood up and pushed
her from him tilting her head back he
looked into her face searchingly then
passed his fingers across her forehead as
if to rub out the lines that zigzagged across
it i am not the kind of a man who uses
words easily emily but god knows how
i have cared for you-knows that for a
week i have been in agony because i
thought i had lost you why girl i have
gone around with murder in my heart
waiting to kill the man who had robbed
me

  his hand swept up to brush back the
hair from her temples his breath catching
as he saw the gray that threaded it

   i am going to bring back your youth
to you emily if love and tenderness will
do it i have been strangling your soul
you said it in that letter and i know it
now but i didnt mean to do it you see

i never realized the need you felt for -
he hesitated searching vainly for the right

words-the need you felt for petting and
for showing your affection but let me tell
you that every hour in my dav you have
been in my thoughts it has been like this
-is she warm enough is she overdoing
is she sleeping well you know that i
have looked out for your physical com-
fort he drew her closer  how long
has it been since i kissed you emily

   the last time was when i got word
about mothers death her voice choked
in her throat

    youll never again have the day stand
out like that he interrupted huskily
raising her face to his

   as his lips met hers the front door was
thrown open

  hello dad ma

   half shyly mrs wright tried to disen-
gage her husbands arms they drew her
closer

   back already stephen ill get
lunch-

   come here steve and kiss vour
mother called john wright holding his
wife fast

    why whats up dad demanded
stephen in surprise

    dont you kiss your mother when vou
come home from school

 im almost seventeen im too old-
 youll never be too old look here
he kissed his wifes flushed cheek  im
not too old and ive some years the best
of you steve

  he laughed to cover the emotion that
swept him then he folded the boys arms
about his mother

    i only quit because-well dad didnt
kiss you ma explained stephen bash-
fully

   then he kissed his mother in what as a
child he had called the  snuggly  place
in her neck and again on her lips

    well we understand one another now
said emily tremulously as her sons arms
fell away from her and then you
both must be half starved

   i he happiness in her own voice as she
spoke the commonplace words thrilled her
as she stopped before the kitchen mirror
to smooth back her hair she laughed under
her breath

   in that last letter to bedford she had
called herself an old woman her eyes
her cheeks her glowing lips gave the words
the lie she was younger than she had
ever been before in her life-and happier
concerning hair-
restorers

by frank x finnegan

ou understand i am not bald
far from it i have a very
comfortable crop of hair for
one of my years but every
now and again some over-
solicitous friend cranes his
neck until i can hear his thorax creak
trying to peer through the undergrowth
he seems to suspect that my hair is
stitched on a silk base then he emits a
criticism

   getting a little bit thin on top there
old boy he says with the genial grin that
is being worn this season in fashionable
insane asylums  youd better get after
it before its all gone youll be half naked
if you lose whats left

  of course this doesnt annoy me i
know how much hair i have-or if you
prefer it how many hairs i have-without
getting any suggestions from outsiders if
i wanted to take the trouble i could count
them and stop all arguments with definite
and positive statistics but as i stepped
into a drug-store the other evening to light
a cigar i decided to get some information
on the subject of hirsuticus cadens or fall-
ing hair

  i am a strong believer in patronizing the
neighborhood drug-stores it encourages
them to stay open late so that there is a
place to get a light on the way home from
the theater

   i suppose i said to the attentive
clerk  that you have more or less calls
for hair-restorers

  i spoke lightly because i did not want
him to imagine that i was particularly in-
terested in the subject also i pulled my
hat down to my eyebrows

   you suppose correctly he replied
 next to handing out two-cent stamps
and answering the telephone its running

back there after hair-restorers that wears
down my rubber heels

   ah there is more than one on the
market then i suggested flicking my
ashes generously on the tessellated floor

   we carry thirty-seven different in-
fallible cures for falling hair he said
 all are guaranteed to grow hair on any
head that is not in the hands of a coroners
jury but there is only one that i can really
recommend its a little preparation of our
own

   what is it like i urged idly envelop-
ing him in a puff of smoke

   well he coughed  we call it hib-
bles happy hit it was discovered by a
man who was furnishing mexican hairless
dogs to the new york market he used to
ship em up here naked when they struck
this climate they shivered so hard that they
shook all their teeth out and starved to
death so he invented this happy hit
and it grew so much hair on the dogs that
he sold them for skye terriers at a hundred
dollars each and made hiseverlasting for-
tune then he sold us the formula its
very easy to apply but dont lick it
some of the dogs did that and it used to
make them bilious

   i have a friend who thinks his hair is
getting a little bit thin i said  i be-
lieve ill take a bottle for him

  he had it wrapped up for me before i
had time to change my mind

   it works fine on friends he remarked
 in fact we sell most of it for them

  i took my flask of happy hit home with
a light heart things looked brighter the
part about the skye terriers appealed to
me they have so much hair-stacks of
it

  i hastened to read the directions and
opened the bottle then i daubed my


munseys magazine

skull copiously following directions i
massaged briskly with my finger-tips

  after a few moments i noticed an un-
usual aroma in my apartment it was that
which lingers around a faithful watch-dog
to complete the illusion i needed only to
bark and wag my tail against the floor
i began to believe what the clerk had said
about the mexican dogs more firmly than
ever

  then i observed that the movement of
my fingers was being arrested by a strange
gluey substance several degrees thicker
than new orleans molasses i glanced
into the mirror my hands were enmeshed
to the hilt in a sticky morass which i
should have declined to recognize but for
the familiar features below it was my
hair

  hastily i seized the bottle of happy
hit and looked again at the directions
there was one trifling point that i had
overlooked

   first dilute two-thirds with alcohol
it read  otherwise the preparation may
thicken slightly

  it had already thickened slightly and
it continued to thicken as the night wore
on it settled down to its task and solidi-
fied i had to sleep crosswise on the bed
with my head hanging over

  in the morning i summoned the janitor
for expert advice he suggested cutting
away the wreckage and shaving my scalp
he said he couldnt see any other way of
making a neat smooth job i balked at
this however i might become bald in
time but i had no desire to volunteer

  we put in the rest of the day inducing
the stuff to let go it took quarts of

benzin and alcohol some of the latter
was applied to my gelatinous locks and
the remainder was consumed by the jani-
tor i found it necessary to treat him as
a brother to insure secrecy what i
thought of mr hibble and his happy hit
by the time we were through could never
be used as a testimonial the police
wouldnt allow it

  i was not to be daunted however hav-
ing started on the hair-restorer route i
was determined to see it through there
was a fascination about the thing i could
readily understand how the druggists had
thirty-seven varieties of hair-restorer on
the market i started in to try all of them

  for several months my head was in a
smeary and odorous state that made my
friends shy visibly when i approached
but i persevered the inventors of all the
remedies advised perseverance

  my first waking thought in the gray
dawn was to peer at my scalp in the mir-
ror and see what had happened overnight
in a saddening succession of instances
nothing had happened my scalp merely
seemed to flush indignantly under the
close scrutiny now and then i thought i
discovered a new hair peeping timidly
above the desert on closer examination
it always proved to be a wrinkle

  when i had worked through the list to
the thirty-fifth infallible preparation my
enthusiasm began to wane my hair had
been doing so with relentless pertinacity
i decided to quit with something in reserve
if i ever really need a hair-restorer there
are two remedies that i can approach with
buoyant optimism at least i have never
tried them

rectitude

    by william slavens mcnutt

irtue is its own reward
aint it the blond girl be-
hind the hotel cigar-counter
quizzed me as she dulled the
sheen of toil on her nose with
a medicated cigarette - paper

 um and if a canary had to live on
what an elephant got for being good the
poor bird would be on some diet  a clear
conscience gives a fine appetite but noth-
ing to feed it with and us good ones dont
even die young if we did i wouldnt
worry but we dont no were too healthy
we live to be old and go to the poorhouse

i wish i was eithera vampire or an idiot

    why the selection i inquired

    cause the vamps take care of them-
selves and some wise old owl with a weak
heart and a swollen wallet always takes
care of a female idiot im just good
enough and sensible enough to have to do
one dollars worth of real work for every
ninety-eight cents i collect im sore i
don t care what i do to-ay im going
to sympathize with the next man that
tells me what a mistake he made when he
married

   notice that dainty little blue-eyed
beam of sunshine that worked the other
shift here for six weeks if she was sun-
shine lock me in the dark she got the
job here because her stepmothers third
cousin by second marriage used to run er-
rands for the managers sister-in-law or
something like that she come here
straight from high school in some young
town east of the mountains just about big
enough to sprout an opry-house on its
upper lip

shes inexperienced the boss says

 but you can soon teach her

not soon nor late no wonder the
hair on her head grew thick and long it



had no opposition she ducked in behind
here and watched me out of those round
china-blue eyes of hers like a girls semi-
nary bonbon fiend at a sob-fest matinee
while i jollied good sales out of a half a
dozen cheap drummers stalled a date with
an old married goat thats got a boy old
enough to beat his time and got rid of a
loving souse without having a row

well i says when trade got slack
for a minute  what do you think of it

     she clapped her little hands and rolled
 those big blue eyes like the smallest child
 actress registering joy

    oh isn t it just too romantic she
squeals

    romantic a waste-basket for all the
cheap talk that any rummy with clothes
good enough to let him in the door and all
of a nickel to spend can pump out of his
system romantic

     just like sewing pants i told her
only more public

    i gave her the run of the stock and let
her try a sale she stood up there at the
counter and posed and threw herself
around like a limber wienerwurst with the
jimjams and simpered and blushed and
kissed her own finger till a fat whiskv
salesman breezed in from the bar with
more under his belt than he had in his
order-book and gave her the eve you
really couldnt blame him if i met a
peach on a low branch out over the side-
walk with the sign  pick me  hung
around its neck-and if i felt like peaches
-id pluck it he slouched his hat a little
over one eye tugged the bottom of his vest
shot his cuffs-they all pull the same pre-
liminaries - and hung one elbow on the
counter

  hello chicken he says  my what
lovely eyes youve got


munseys magazine

     o-o-oh she says just like that-like
a train letting off the air-brakes  do you
think so o-o-oh thank you

   it almost sobered him up he backed
off and took a good look when he saw
it was real he got down to business in a
hurry my but his work was coarse
never saw a girl he said that affected him
the way she did something about her that
attracted him the moment he laid eyes on
her never been much of a hand to fuss
around the ladies but the moment he saw
her- wasnt it funny how they both
liked the same things wah

   he pulled all that old summer-resort
canoe stuff and she fairly climbed over the
show-case to get it hed got down to
 that little bit of supper some place and
she was nodding her head so fast its a
wonder she didnt dislocate her neck when
i butted in with a few well-chosen words
that jarred him out of his poultry-yard

   as she got more experience-got the
hang of things so to speak-she got worse
every bum that smiled at her was just wild
to slip the matrimonial lariat over her neck
and drag her away to a life of idle luxury
-according to her version of it if they
frowned why they were being gnawed by
a secret passion which for some mysterious
reason they couldnt divulge we roomed
together up-stairs and it kept me busy
pulling her back from the abyss she was
always tottering on the brink as a long-
distance totterer she had that president
hew-erta of mexico beat by a dozen
precipices

   i talked it over with mr matthews
you know him the heavy-set good-
looking fellow with the iron-gray hair and
nose-glasses lived here in the hotel for
a couple of years i once had hopes there
id have done a tandem with him if id
had the chance he had lots of money
and hed wrote a book called  the psycho-
logical relation of poverty and crime
he used to talk with me about it i
couldnt understand it but it was awful in-
teresting gee i liked him he felt bad
about bernice

     she has absolutely no chance situated
as she is he says

     the trouble with her is shes got too
many chances i told him

     yes he says  chances for evil she
is like a beautiful moth fluttering about the
searing flame and doomed to be consumed
in the brilliance that attracts her

   i always fell ior him strong when he
talked like that it sounded fine now to
me she was just a flossy little empty-headed
boob about ripe to learn some lessons not
taught in school and learn them quick and
painful

   well the front-page stuff started to
pop last night she was due on at eight
and when she didnt show i sent a bell-
hop up to get her he brought back a
letter shed left pinned to her pillow it
was a fine letter id read most of it in a
book by bertha m clay that i found up
in the room the rest of it said she had
benzined for paradise with larry marma-
duke in his whiz-cart and was going to
live happy ever after and do good to the
poor with his money the first stop on
the road to heaven was to be tacoma for
some mysterious reason - she was strong
for mystery shed believe anything that
you couldnt explain to her-larry couldnt
be married in seattle so they was going
to stop in tacoma to have the seal of the
church and state stamped on their little
package of bliss billed right through to a
box seat with the angels

   you know young marmaduke him
marry hed run away with a rheumatic
squaw if no other woman was in sight
but he wouldnt marry a combination of
cleopatra and joan of arc just then i
saw mr matthews and i called him over
and showed him the letter

  too bad he says  poor little girl
cant we do something i says

     get a machine and follow them up
he says  it may not be too late ill
frustrate that blatk-hearted hound yet

   he had an elegant way of putting
things didnt he i always fell for him
strong when he talked like that i left the
tobacco industry flat on its back and run
out into the street after him it was rain-
ing hard but i didnt mind after the first
minute because then i couldnt get any
wetter

    we tumbled into a big seven-passenger
machine and mr matthews give the
chauffeur a handful of gold and told him
not to wait around he didnt he
kicked in the bottom of the car with his
feet and all of a sudden we exploded and
just fell out of the city im going to walk
over the route when i have time and get
my breath back

 about twenty miles out we come to a
sick machine and in the glare of our head-
the rocky road of rectitude



lights we saw larry marmaduke down on
his knees in the mud operating on it we
jumpedout and run up in the rain and
bernice stuck her head out of the machine
and says

      o-o-oh mr matthews

      my dear little girl  he says  thank
 god i have come in time this loathsome
 blackguard means to betray you

    he talked awful solemn and moral t
always fell for him strong when he spoke
like that

     o-o-oh mr matthews bernice
squeals all up and down the scale  do
you think so

    larry got up on his feet and says
where do you horn in on this party
you four-eyed remnant

    then while mr matthews was taking
his glasses off larry beaned him it was
an awful fight mr matthews done fine
but larrys bigger than him and was beat-
ing him up i told the chauffeur to get in
and do something but he says

      i m a chauffeur not a prize-fighter
  so i got a wrench out of the tool-box
 and went and refereed the scrap till i got
 my chance then i pasted a jack johnson
 on one of larrys curls and he slept a
 while mr matthews got up out of the
 mud and says to me

      youre a brave girl you have saved
my life for that fiend would have mur-
dered me

    it was awful dignified the way he said
it i always fell for him strong when he
talked like that then he went over and
comforted bernice ever since the scrap
started shed been bawling and jumping up
and down and waving her hands like a
spoiled kid thats dropped her buttered
bread usual side down in the dirt mr
matthews got her cooled off finally so that
you could hear yourself speak if you yelled
real loud we all got into the machine
and the chauffeur started to turn around
to go back but just then larry woke up
and heaved a sliver off a young mountain
that hit our poor chauffeur just outside of
his brains he let go the wheel and the car
upset in the ditch and spilled us on some-
bodys wheat-field while we was picking
out our own legs and arms and things
larry fixed his car and beat it

   it was dark and wet and cold and
lonesome and bernice threw the stopper
away and spilled all the noise there was
left m her

      there there my poor child mr
 matthews says  dont crv i beg of you
 i will protect you

    it was awful nice the way he said it
 but it made me sore somehow then i
 had to wade through the mud for two miles
 to the nearest farmhouse while mr mat-
 thews carried the poor dear angel simp
 in his arms her dreadful experience had
 weakened her so she couldnt walk a step

 i	d hate to have seen the dear sweet hussy
 boiled to death in oil of course but if
 somebody had tarred and feathered her or
 burned just one eye out with a red-hot
 poker i could have stood it

    we phoned from the farm for a ma-
 chine and it beat daylight to us but not
 much i was all in by the time wre got
 started back and i went right to sleep in
 the tonneau when mr matthews woke
 me up we was out here in front of the
 hotel and it was beginning to get light

     my dear brave girl congratulate us
 he says  we owe it all to you

   then i noticed that he was hugging
 bernice sleep went away from me and
 left me there to take it wide awake

     its all been a terrible mistake mr
 matthews says  she loves only me and
 she was driven to her rash act of last night
 by my neglect how was i to know that
 the dearest sweetest most lovable creature
 in the world could possibly care for a
 crabbed old bachelor like nie and she
 has consented to wed me at once this
 morning

    it sounded awful silly the way he said
 it sounded just like stale candy smells
 but thats about the works i guess shes
 slated for a yum-yum trip around the
 world i got bowled out for ditching the
 job like i done spoiled a dress and a pair
 of shoes caught cold in my head and
 sprained my disposition oh you virtue

    so youre going to turn vampire for
 revenge i inquired

    me for the vamp stuff she assured
 me earnestly

   a fat man in a loud check suit with an
 overgrown diamond in his tie bought a
 handful of cigars and leaning over the
 counter whispered to her confidentially

    no breeze she declared with anem-
 phatic shake of her head  not none
 with you why say if i was the sahara
 desert and you were a drop of water in
 the middle of me youd have to run a
 thousand miles to spill

he knew my father

t- he look of him was wholly commonplace-

j his grizzled beard worn garments fur-
          rowed face

it wanted all my life-learned poise to keep
suppressed an adverse note that strove to creep
into my judgment as i viewed the man

so shaped he seemed on utter failures plan

his was the seldom-travelers furtive look
cowering uneasy in his red-plush nook

to me at length for friendliness he turned

for human fellowship this lone man yearned

i humored his pathetic eagerness

to know my name my calling my address

  your fathers name  he trembled as he spoke
 and when i told him oer his features broke
 a look of satisfaction deep and sweet
 as if id made his cup of joy replete

 i knowed your dad - why him an me was
     chums 

and then i knew the happiness that comes
to every father-hungry grown-up lad
who never ceases longing for the dad
so little understood in callow days-

 so quick to blame he seemed so slow lo praise
 so wished-for now when wisdom holds her
 throne

 that for our disrespect we might atone i

 about that head erstwhile so commonplace

 a halo formed of glory and of grace

hed known and loved the father i had known
as boy friends intimate the two had grown 

 i clung to him-i all but held his hand

 this magic guest from an cnchanted land

now with a thrill his voice in memory comes
 i knowed your dad - why him an me was
chums

  aheres my old dog i cry in jest
vv the child from the house above
sinks her hands in his broad white chest
and strains him back from his love

well she knows as she holds him fast

    that his heart is otherwhere-

that i wait for his frantic leaps at last
    and his roguish dear despair

  wheres my old dog  i cry again

 as the pines shut close on the trail

 there comes a sound from that throat so fain
 as my feet go swift in the dale

 his bark rings far through the darkling wood
 mutinous eager strong

 and i smile as i think that though she would
 she cannot hold him for long

  wheres my old dog  i cry once more

 ah foolish clamor and quest

 for though he tugs on a neighbors floor
 his kennel waits in my breast

 the wood is still as the twilight hush
 renders its world-caress

 who so fleet in the crackling brush-

 blind in his eagerness

 love-hot yelps of a heart set free

 gladly i welcome the shock

 as my dog flows upward in joy on me

here is as every schoolboy
  knows in this scientific age a
  very close chemical relation be-
  tween coal and diamonds it
  is the reason i believe why
  some people allude to coal as
   black diamonds

  both these commodities represent wealth
but coal is a much less portable form of
property there is from that point of view
a deplorable lack of concentration in coal
now if a coal-mine could be put into ones
waistcoat-pocket-but it cant

  at the same time there is a fascination in
coal the supreme commodity of the age in
which we are camped like bewildered travelers
in a garish unrestful hotel and i suppose
those two considerations the practical and the
mystical prevented heyst - axel heyst -
from going away

  the tropical belt coal company went into
liquidation the world of finance is a mys-
terious world in which incredible as the fact
may appear evaporation precedes liquidation

	cotyright  by

 first the capital evaporates and then the com-
 pany goes into liquidation these arc very
 unnatural physics but they account for the
 persistent inertia of heyst at which we  out
 there  used to laugh among ourselves-but
 not inimically

   an inert body can do no harm to any one
 provokes no hostility is scarcely worth deri-
 sion it may indeed be in the way some-
 timesbut this could not be said of axel
 heyst he was out of everybodys way as if
 he were perched on the highest peak of the
 himalayas and in a sense as conspicuous

   every one in that part of the world knew
 of him dwelling on his little island an
 island is but the top of a mountain axel
 heyst perched on it immovably was sur-
 rounded instead of the stormy ocean of air
 merging into infinity by a tepid shallow sea
 a passionless offshoot of the great waters
 which embrace the continents of this globe

   his most frequent visitors were shadows
 the shadows of clouds relieving the monotony
 of the inanimate brooding sunshine of the

 tropics his nearest neighbor-i am speaking
 now of things showing some sort of animation
 -was an indolent volcano which smoked faint-
 ly all day with its head just above the north-
 ern horizon and at night leveled at him from
 among the clear stars a dull red glow ex-
 panding and collapsing spasmodically like the
 end of a gigantic cigar puffed at intermittent-
 ly in the dark axel heyst was also a smoker
 and when he lounged out on his veranda with
 his cheroot the last thing before going to bed
 he made in the night the same sort of glow
 as that other one so many miles away

   in a sense the volcano was company lo him
 in the shades of the night-which were often
 too thick one would think to let a breath of
 air through there was seldom enough wind
 to blow a feather along on most evenings of
 the year heyst could have sat outside with a
 naked candlp to read one of the books left
 him by his late father

   on the nights of full moon the silence
 around samburan-the  round island  of
 the charts-was dazzling and the sky emp-
 tied of stars and with the lonely orb looked
 as desolate as the empty and luminous sea
 the warm glow of the volcano was extinguished
 by the flood of cold light i dont know
 whether heyst missed its company i dare
 say not

   in exchange he could see his immediate
 surroundings which had the aspect of an
 abandoned settlement invaded by the jungle
 there were vague roofs above low vegetation
 and broken shadows of bamboo fences in the
 sheen of long grass something like an over-
 grown bit of road slanted among ragged
 thickets toward the shore only a couple of
 hundred yards away with a black rickety
 jetty and a mound of some sort quite inky on
 its unlighted side

   but the most conspicuous object was a
 gigantic blackboard raised on two posts and
 presenting to heyst when the moon got over
 that side the white letters  t b c co in
 a row at least two feet high these were the
 initials of the tropical belt coal company his
 employers-his late employers to be precise

   according to the unnatural mysteries of the
 financial world the t b c companys capi-
 tal having evaporated in ihe course of two
 years the company went into liquidation-
 forced i believe not voluntary there was
 nothing forcible in the process however it
 was slow and while the liquidation-in lon-
 don and amsterdam - pursued its languid
 course axel heyst styled in the prospectus
 manager in the tropics remained at his
 

 post on samburan the no i coaling-station
 of the company

    and it was not only a mere coaling-station
 there was a coal-mine there with an outcrop
 in the hillside less than five hundred yards
 from the rickety wharf and the imposing
 blackboard the companys object had been
 to get hold of all the outcrops on tropical
 islands and exploit them locally and lord
 knows there were any amount of outcrops
 it was heyst who had located most of them in
 this part of the tropical belt during his rather
 aimless wanderings and being a ready letter-
 writer had written pages and pages about
 them to his friends in europe at least so
 it was said

   we doubted whether he had any visions of
 wealth-for himself at any rale what he
 seemed mostly concerned for was ihe  stride
 forward as he expressed it he was heard
 by more than a hundred persons in the
 islands talking of a  great stride forward for
 these regions the convinced wave of the
 hand which accompanied the phrase suggested
 tropical distances being impelled onward in
 connection with the finished courtesy of his
 manner it was persuasive or at any rate si-
 lencing-for a time at least

   nobody cared to argue with him when he
 talked in this strain his earnestness was dis-
 couraging and we thought also that it could
 do no harm to anybody there was no danger
 of any one taking seriously his dream of
 tropical coal so what was the use of hurting
 his feelings

   ihus reasoned men in reputable business
 officesrfvhere he had his entree as a person
 who came out east with letters of introduction
 and modest letters of credit too - some
 years before these coal outcrops began to crop
 up in his playfully courteous talk from the
 first there was some difficulty in making him
 out he was not a traveler a traveler ar-
 rives and departs goes on somewhere heyst
 did not depart

   i met a man once-the manager of the
 branch of the oriental banking corporation
 in malacca-to whom heyst exclaimed in the
 biliiard-room of the club

 i am enchanted with these islands
 lie said it suddenly in no connection with
 anything else -a propos des bottes as the
 irench say and while chalking his cue and
 perhaps it was some sort of enchantment

 i here are more spells than your common-
 place magicians ever dreamed of

 roughly speaking a circle with a radius of
 eight hundred miles drawn round a point in


munseys magazine

north borneo was in heysts case a magic
circle it just touched manila and he had
been seen there it just touched saigon and
he was likewise seen there once perhaps
these were his attempts to break out if so
they were failures the enchantment must
have been an unbreakable one

  the manager-the man who heard the ex-
clamation-had been so impressed by the tone
of it that he had related the experience to
more than one person

  queer chap that swede was his only
comment but this is the origin of the name

 enchanted heyst which some fellows fast-
ened on our man

  he also had other names in his early
years long before he got so bald on the top
he went to present a letter of introduction to
mr tesman of tesman brothers a soura-
bava firm-tip-top house well mr tesman
was a kindly benevolent old gentleman he
did not know what to make of that caller
after telling him that they wished to make
his stay among the islands as pleasant as pos-
sible and that they were ready to assist him
in his plans and so on and after receiving
heysts thanks-you know the usual kind of
conversation - he proceeded to query in a
slow paternal tone

    and you are interested in-

   facts broke in heyst in his courtly
voice theres nothing worth knowing but
facts hard facts facts alone mr tes-
man

  i dont know if old tesman agreed with
him or not but he must have spoken about
it because for a time our man got the name
of  hard facts he had the singular good
fortune that his sayings stuck to him and be-
came part of his name

  thereafter he mooned about the java sea
in some of the tesmans trading schooners
and then vanished on an arab ship in the di-
rection of new guinea he remained so lone
in that outlying part of his enchanted circle
that he was nearly forgotten before he swam
into view again in a native proa full of goram
vagabonds burned black by the sun very lean
his hair much thinned on top and a portfolio
of sketches under his arm he showed these
willingly but was very reserved as to any-
thing else he had had an  amusing time
he said a man who will go to new guinea
for fun-well

   later years afterward when the last ves-
tiges of youth had gone off his face and all
the hair off the top of his head and his red-
gold pair of horizontal mustaches had grown

 to really noble proportions a certain disrepu-
 table white man fastened upon him an epithet
 putting down with a shaking hand a long glass
 emptied of its contents-paid for by heyst-
 he said with that deliberate sagacity which no
 mere water-drinker ever attained

    heysts a puftect gnleman puffect but
 hes a ut-uto-utopist

  heyst had just gone out of the place of
public refreshment where this pronouncement
was voiced utopist eh upon my word the
only thing i heard him say which might have
had a bearing on the point was his invitation
to old mcnab himself turning with that
finished courtesy of attitude movement voice
which was his obvious characteristic he had
said with delicate playfulness

    come along and quench your thirst with
us mr mcnab

  perhaps that was it a man who could
propose even playfully to quench old me
xabs thirst must have been a utopist a pur-
suer of chimeras for of downright irony
heyst was not prodigal and maybe this
was the reason why he was generally liked

   at that epoch in his life in the fulness of
 his physical development of a broad martial
 presence with his bald head and long mus-
 tache he resembled charles xii of adven-
 turous memory however we had no reason
 to think that heyst was in any way a fighting
 man

ii

  it was about this time that heyst became
associated with morrison

  one day heyst turned up in timor why
in timor of all places in the world no one
knows well he was mooning about delli
that highly pestilential place possibly in
search of some undiscovered facts when he
came in the street upon morrison who in
his way was also an  enchanted  man

  when you spoke to morrison of going home
-he was from dorsetshire-he shuddered
he said it was dark and wet there that it
was like living with your head and shoulders
in a moist gunny-bag that was only his ex-
aggerated style of talking

  morrison was  one of us he was owner
and master of the capricorn trading brig and
was understood to be doing well with her
except for too much autruism he was the
dearly beloved friend of a number of remote
villages up dark creeks and obscure bays
where he traded for  produce

   he would often sail through awfully danger-
 ous channels up to some village only to find


victory



a very hungry population clamorous for rice
and without so much  produce  between
them as would have filled morrisons suit-
case he would land the rice all the same
amid general rejoicings explain to the people
that it was an advance that they were in
debt to him now would preach to them energy
and industry and make an elaborate note in a
pocket diary which he always carried and
this would be the end of that transaction i
dont know if morrison thought so but the
villagers had no doubt whatever about it

  we used to remonstrate with him

   you will never see any of your advances
if you go on like this morrison

  he would put on a knowing air

   i shall squeeze them yet some day-never
you fear and that reminds me-pulling
out his inseparable pocketbook- theres that
so-and-so village they are pretty well off
again i may just as well squeeze them to
begin with

  he would make a ferocious entry in the
pocketbook

  memo-squeeze the so-and-so village at the
first time of calling

  then he would stick the pencil back and
snap the elastic on with inflexible finality but
he never began the squeezing

  when heyst met him in delli morrison
was walking along the street his eye-glass
tossed over his shoulder his head down with
the hopeless aspect of those hardened tramps
one sees on our roads trudging from work-
house to workhouse being hailed across the
street he looked up with a wild worried ex-
pression he was really in despair he had
come the week before into delli and the
portuguese authorities on some pretense of ir-
regularity in his papers had inflicted a fine
upon him and had arrested his brig

  morrison never had any spare cash in hand
with his system of trading it would have been
strange if he had and all these debts entered
in the pocketbook werent good enough to
raise a milreis on-let alone a penny the
portuguese officials begged him not to distress
himself they gave him a weeks grace and
then proposed to sell the brig at auction this
meant ruin for morrison and when heyst
hailed him across the street in his usual court-
ly tone the week was nearly out

  heyst crossed over and said with a slight
bow and in the manner of a prince addressing
another prince on a private occasion

  what an unexpected pleasure would
you have any objection to drink something

with me in that infamous wine-shop over
there the sun is really too strong to talk
in the street

   the haggard morrison followed obediently
into a somber cool hovel which he would have
disdained to enter at any other time he w-as
distracted he did not know what he was
doing you could have led him over the edge
of a precipice just as easily as into that wine-
shop

  he sat down like an automaton he was
speechless but he saw a glass full of rough
red wine before him and drank it heyst
meantime politely watchful had taken a seat
opposite

    you are in for a bout of fever i fear
he said sympathetically

  poor morrisons tongue was loosened at
last

    fever he cried  give me fever give
me plague they are diseases one gets over
them but i am being murdered i am be-
ing murdered by the portuguese the gang
here downed me at last among them i am
to have my throat cut the day after to-
morrow

   morrisons despairing reserve had broken
clown he had been wandering with a dry
throat all over that miserable town of mud
hovels silent with no soul to turn to in his
distress and positively maddened by his
thoughts and suddenly he had stumbled on
a white man figuratively and actually white
-for morrison refused to accept the racial
whiteness of the portuguese officials

   he let himself go for the mere relief of
violent speech his elbows planted on the table
his eyes bloodshot his voice nearly gone the
brim of his round pith hat shading an un-
shaven livid face his white clothes which
he had not taken off for three days were
dingy he looked already gone to the bad
past redemption

  the sight was shocking to heyst but he
let nothing of it appear in his bearing con-
cealing his impression under that consummate
good-society manner of his polite attention
whats due from one gentleman listening to
another was what he showed and as usual it
was catching so that morrison pulled himself
together and finished his narrative in a con
versational tone with a man-of-the-world air

   its a villainous plot unluckily one is
helpless that scoundrel cousinho-andreas
you know - has been coveting the brig for
years naturally i would never sell she is
not only my livelihood shes my life so he
has hatched this pretty little plot with the


lit

munseys magazine

chief of the customs the sale of course
will be a farce theres no one here to bid
he will get the brig for a song-no not even
that a line of a song you have been some
years now in the islands heyst you know
us all you have seen how we live now you
shall have the opportunity to see how some of
us end for it is the end for me you see it-
dont you

   morrison had pulled himself together but
 one felt the snapping strain on his recovered
 self-possession heyst was beginning to say
 with a drawl of urbane thoughtfulness that he
 could very well see all the bearings of this
 unfortunate- when morrison interrupted him
 jerkily

    lpon my word i dont know why i have
 been telling you all this i suppose seeing a
 thoroughly white man like you made it im-
 possible to keep my trouble to myself i see
 now that words cant do it justice but since
 ive told you so much i may as well tell you
 more listen this morning on board in
 my cabin i went down on my knees and
 prayed for help i went down on my knees
 you are a believer morrison asked
 heyst with a distinct note of respect

    surely i am not an infidel

   morrison was swiftly reproachful in his an-
 swer and there came a pause morrison per-
 haps interrogating his conscience and heyst
 preserving a mien of unperturbed polite in-
 terest

    i prayed like a child of course i believe
 in children praying-well women too but i
 rather think god expects men to be more self-
 reliant i don t hold with a man everlastingly
 bothering the almighty with his silly troubles

 it seems such cheek anyhow this morning i
 -i have never done any harm to any one
 knowingly-i prayed a sudden impulse-i- 
 went flop on my knees so you may judge-
 they w-cre gazing earnestly into each others
 eyes poor morrison added as a discouraging
 afterthought

 only this is such a god-forsaken spot
heyst did not depart from his habitual
urbanity he inquired with a delicate intona-
tion whether he might know the amount for
which the brig was seized

   morrison suppressed an oath and named
 curtlv a sum which was relatively so insignifi-
 cant that any other person than heyst would
 have exclaimed at it and even heyst could
 hardly keep incredulity out of his politelv
 modulated voice as he asked if it was a fact
 that morrison had not that amount in hand
 morrison hadnt he had onlv a little eng-

 lish gold a few sovereigns on board he had
 left all his spare cash with the tesmans in
 samarang to meet certain bills which would
 fall due while he was away on his cruise any-
 how that money would not have been any
 more good to him than if it had been in the
 innermost depths of the infernal regons

    he said all this bruskly he looked with
 sudden disfavor at that noble bald forehead
 at those great martial mustaches at the tired
 eyes of the man sitting opposite him morri-
 son knew no more of heyst than the rest of
 us trading in the archipelago did had the
 swede suddenly risen and hit him on the nose
 he could not have been taken more aback than
 when this stranger this nondescript wranderer
 said with a little bow across the table

    oh if that s the case i would be very
 happy pray command me

   morrison didnt understand this was one
 ol those things that dont happen-unheard-of
 things he had no real inkling of what it
 meant till heyst said definitely

    i can lend you the amount

    you have the money whispered morri-
 son  do you mean here in your pocket

     yes on me glad to be of use

    morrison staring open - mouthed groped
 over his shoulder for the cord of the eye-glass
 hanging down his back when he found it he
 stuck it in his eye hastily it was as if he ex-
 pected heysts usual white suit of the tropics
 to change into a shining garment flowing down
 to his toes and a pair of great dazzling
 wings to sprout on the swedes shoulders-
 and didnt want to miss a single detail of the
 transformation

   but if heyst was an angel from on high
 sent in answer to prayer he did not betray his
 heavenly origin by outward signs so instead
 of going on his knees as he felt inclined to
 do morrison stretched out his hand which
 heyst grasped with formal alacrity and a po-
 lite murmur

     trifle-delighted-of service

  miracles do happen thought the awe-
 struck morrison to him as to all of us in
 the islands this wandering heyst who didnt
 toil or spin visibly seemed the very last person
 to be the agent of providence in an affajr
 concerned with money

 as they were trudging together through the
 sand of the roadway to the custom-house-
 another mud hovel-to pay the fine morrison
 oke into a cold sweat stopped short and
 claimed in faltering accents

 i say you arent joking heyst

    joking heysts blue eyes w-ent hard as
victory



 he turned them on the discomposed morrison
  in what way may i ask he conjinued with
 austere politeness

  morrison was abashed

   forgive me heyst you must have been
sent by god in answer to my prayer i have
been nearly off my chump for three days with
worry and it suddenly struck me what if
its the devil who sent him 

   i have no connection with the super-
natural said heyst graciously moving on
 nobody has sent me i just happened
along

   i know better contradicted morrison
 i may be unworthy but i have been heard
i know it i feel it for why should you
offer-

  heyst inclined his head as from respect for
a conviction in which he could not share but
he stuck to his point by muttering that in the
presence of an odious fact like this twas
natural-

  later in the day the fine paid and the two
of them on board the brig from which the
guard had been removed morrison-who be-
sides being a gentleman was also an honest
fellow-began to talk about repayment he
knew very well his inability to lay by any sum
of money it was partly the fault of circum-
stances and partly of his temperament and it
would have been very difficult to apportion the
responsibility between the two

   i dont know how it is that i cant save
he observed with a worried air  its some
sort of curse theres always a bill or two to
meet

  he plunged his hand into his pocket for the
famous note-book so well known in the islands
and fluttered the pages feverishly

   and yet-look he went on  there it
is-more than seven thousand dollars owing
surely thats something

  he ceased suddenly heyst who had been
all the time trying to look as unconcerned as
he could made reassuring noises in his throat
but morrison was not only honest he was
honorable too and on this stressful day be-
fore this amazing emissary of providence and
in the revulsion of his feelings he made his
great renunciation he renounced the abiding
illusion of his existence

   no no they are no good ill never
be able to squeeze them never ive been
saying for years i would but i give up i
never really believed i could dont reckon
on that heyst i have robbed you

  poor morrison actually laid his head on the
cabin table and remained in that crushed at-

titude while heyst talked to him soothingly
the swede was as much distressed as morri-
son they must have had both of them a fair-
ly painful time of it in the cabin of the brig
in the end morrison casting desperately for
an idea in the blackness of his despondency
hit upon the notion of inviting heyst to travel
with him in his brig and have a share in his
trading ventures up to the amount of his loan

   it is characteristic of heysts unattached
floating existence that he was in a position to
accept this proposal there is no reason to
think that he wanted particularly just then to
go poking aboard the brig into all the holes
and corners of the archipelago where morri-
son picked up most of his trade far from it
but he would have consented to almost any
arrangement in order to put an end to the
harrowing scene in the cabin there was at
once a great transformation act morrison
raised his diminished head and stuck the glass
in his eye to look affectionately at heyst a
bottle was uncorked

  it was agreed that nothing should be said
to any one of this transaction morrison you
understand was not proud of the episode and
he was afraid of being unmercifully chaffed

  an old bird like me to let myself be
trapped by those portuguese rascals i should
never hear the last of it we must keep it
dark

  from quite other motives among which his
native delicacy was the principal heyst was
even more anxious to bind himself to silence
a gentleman would naturally shrink from the
part of heavenly messenger that morrison
would force upon him it made heyst un-
comfortable as it was and perhaps he did
not care that it should be known that he had
some means whatever they might have been
-sufficient at any rate to enable him to lend
money to people

  these two men had a duet down there like
conspirators in a comic opera of  sh-ssh sh
-ssh secrecy secrecy it must have been
funny because they were very serious about it
and for a time the conspiracy was successful
in so far that we all concluded that heyst
was boarding with the good-natured - some
said sponging on the imbecile-morrison in
his brig

  but you know how it is with all such mys-
teries there is always a leak somewhere
morrison himself not a perfect vessel by any
means was bursting with gratitude and under
the stress he must have let out something
vague - enough to give the island gossip a
chance and you know how kindly the world


mcjnseys magazine

is in its comments on what it does not under-
stand a rumor sprang out that heyst hav-
ing got some mysterious hold on morrison
had fastened himself on him and was sucking
him dry

    those who had traced these mutterings back
 to their origin were very careful not to believe
 them the originator it seems was a certain
 schomberg a big manly bearded creature of
 the teutonic persuasion with an ungovern-
 able longue which surely must have worked
 on a pivot whether he was a lieutenant of
 the reserve as he declared i dont know out
 there he was by profession a hotel-keeper first
 in bangkok then somewhere else and ulti-
 mately in sourabaya he dragged after him
 up and down that section of the tropical belt
 a silent frightened little woman with long
 ringlets who smiled at one stupidly showing
 a blue tooth

    i dont know why so many of us patronized
 his various establishments he was a noxious
 ass and he satisfied his lust for silly gossip
 at the cost of his customers it was he who
 one evening as morrison and heyst went past
 the hotel-they were not his regular patrons-
 whispered mysteriously to the mixed company
 assembled on the veranda

    the spider and the fly just gone by
 gentlemen then very important and con-
 fidential his thick paw at the side of his
 mouth  we are among ourselves well
 gentlemen all i can say is dont you ever get
 mixed up with that swede dont you ever
 get caught in his web

ill

   human nature being what it is having a
 silly side to it as well as a mean side there
 were not a few who pretended to be indignant
 on no better authority than a general pro-
 pensity to believe every evil report and a
 good many others who found it simply funnv
 to call heyst the spider-behind his back of
 course he was as serenely unconscious of
 this as of his several other nicknames

    but soon people found other things to say
 of ileyst not long afterward he came very
 much to the fore in larger affairs he blos-
 somed out into something definite he filled
 the public eye as the manager on the spot of
 the tropical belt coal company with offices
 in london and amsterdam and other things
 about it that sounded and looked grandiose

 the offices in the two capitals may have
 consisted-and probably did-of one room in
 each but at that distance out east there all
 this had an air we were more puzzled than

 dazzled it is true but even the most sober-
 minded among us began to think that there
 was something in it the tesmans appointed
 agents a contract for government mail-boats
 secured the era of steam beginning for the
 islands a great stride forward - heysts
 stride

   we heard that morrison had gone home
 through the suez canal in order to push the
 magnificent coal idea personally in london
 he parted with his brig and disappeared from
 our ken but we heard that he had written a
 letter or letters to heyst saying that london
 was cold and gloomy that he was as lonely
 as a crow in a strange country in truth he
 pined after the capricorn-i dont mean the
 tropic i mean the ship

    later on he went into dorsetshire to see his
 people caught a bad cold and died with ex-
 traordinary precipitation in the bosom of his
 appalled family whether his exertions in
 the city of london had enfeebled his vitality
 i don t know but i believe it was this visit
 that put life into the coal idea be it as it
 may the tropical belt coal company was
 born very shortly after morrison the victim
 of gratitude and his native climate had gone
 to join his forefathers in a dorsetshire church-
 yard

    heyst was immensely shocked he got the
 news in the moluccas through the tesmans
 and then disappeared for a time it appears
 that he stayed with a dutch government doc-
 tor in amboyna a friend of his who looked
 after him for a bit in his bungalow

    he became visible again rather suddenly
 his eyes sunk in his head and with a sort of
 guarded attitude as if afraid some one would
 reproach him with the dealh of morrison

    as a matter of fact many of us did not
 hear of it till months afterward-from schom-
 berg who disliked heyst gratuitously and
 made up a piece of sinister whispered gossip

    that s what comes of having anything to
 do with that fellow he squeezes you dry
 like a lemon then chucks you out-sends you
 home to die take warning by morrison

 of course we laughed at the innkeepers
 suggestions of black mystery several of us
 heard that heyst was prepared to go to eu-
 rope himself to push on his coal enterprise
 personally but he never went it wasnt
 necessary the company was formed with-
 out him and his nomination of manager in
 the tropics came out to him by post

 from the first he had selected samburan
 or round island for the central station
 some copies of the prospectus issued in eu-


victory



 rope having found their way out east were
 passed from hand to hand we greatly ad-
 mired the map which accompanied them for
 the edification of the shareholders on it
 samburan was represented as the central spot
 of the eastern hemisphere with its name en-
 graved in enormous capitals heavy lines
 radiated from it in all directions through the
 tropics figuring a mysterious and effective
 star lines of influence or lines of distance or
 something of that sort theres no more ro-
 mantic temperament on earth than the tem-
 perament of a company promoter

   engineers came out coolies were imported
 bungalows were put up on samburan a gal-
 jc-ry driven into the hillside and actually some
 coal got out these manifestations shook the
 soberest minds for a time everybody in the
 islands was talking of the tropical belt coal
 company and even those who smiled quietly
 to themselves were only hiding their un-
 easiness

   oh yes it had come and anybody could
 see what would be the consequences-the end
 of the individual trader smothered under a
 great invasion of steamers we could not
 afford to buy steamers not we and heyst
 was the manager

    you know heyst enchanted heyst

   oh come he was no better than a
 loafer around here as far back as any of us
 can remember

     yes said he was looking for facts well
 hes got hold of one that will do for all of
 us commented a bitter voice

   that s what they call development-and
 be hanged to it muttered another

   never was heyst talked about so much in
 the tropical belt before

     isnt he a swedish baron or something
    he a baron get along with you

   for my part i havent the slightest doubt
 that he was while he was still drifting among
 the islands enigmatical and disregarded like
 an insignificant ghost he told me so himself
 on a certain occasion it was a long time be-
 fore he materialized in this alarming way into
 the destroyer of our little industry-heyst
 the enemy

 it became the fashion with a good many to
 speak of heyst as the enemy he was very
 concrete very visible now he was rushing
 all over the archipelago jumping in and out
 of mail-packets as if they had been tram-cars
 here there and everywhere-organizing with
 all his might

 this was no mooning about this was busi-
 ness and this sudden display of purposeful

 energy shook the incredulity of the most
 skeptical more than any scientific demonstra-
 tion of the value of his coal-outcrops could
 have done it was impressive

   schomberg was the only one who resisted
 the infection big manly in a portly style
 and profusely bearded with a glass of beer in
 his thick paw he would approach some table
 where the topic of the hour wras being dis-
 cussed would listen for a moment and then
 would come out with his invariable declara-
 tion 

    all this is very well gentlemen but he
 can t throw any of his coal-dust in mv eyes
 theres nothing in it why there cant be
 anything in it a fellow like that for man-
 ager phoo

    was it the clairvoyance of imbecile hatred
 or mere stupid tenacity of opinion which ends
 sometimes by scoring against the world in a
 most astonishing manner most of us can
 remember instances of triumphant folly and
 that ass schomberg triumphed the t b c
 co went into liquidation as i began by telling
 you

    the talk died out and presently it was re-
 marked here and there that heyst had faded
 completely away he had become invisible
 as in those early days when he used to make
 a bolt clear out of sight in his attempts to
 break away from the enchantment of  these
 isles either in the direction of new guinea
 or in the direction of saigon-to cannibals or
 to cafes

   the enchanted heyst had he at last
 broken the spell had he died we were
 too indifferent to wonder overmuch schom-
 berg was the only man who couldnt forget
 heyst the keen manly teutonic creature
 was a good hater a fool often is

    good evening gentlemen have you got
 everything you want so good you see
 what was i always telling you aha there

 was nothing in it i knew it but what i

 would like to know is what became of that

 swede

    he put a stress on the word swede as if it
 meant scoundrel he detested scandinavians
 generally why goodness only knows a
 fool like that is unfathomable he continued

    its five months or more since i have
 spoken to anybody who has seen him

 as i have said we were not much inter-
 ested but schomberg of course could not
 understand that he was grotesquely dense
 whenever three people came together in his
 hotel he took good care that heyst should be
 with them


munseys magazine

   i hope the fellow did not go and drown
himself he would add with a comical earnest-
ness that ought to have made us shudder only
our crowd was superficial and did not appre-
hend the psychology of this pious hope

   why heyst isnt in debt to you for
drinks is he somebody asked him once with
shallow scorn

  drinks oh dear no

  the innkeeper put on a sinister expression
to tell us that heyst had not paid perhaps
three visits altogether to his  establishment
this was heysts crime for which he wished
him nothing less than a long and tormented
existence

  at last one afternoon schomberg was seen
approaching a group of his customers he was
obviously in high glee he squared his manly
chest

  gentlemen i have news of him who
why that swede he is still on samburan
hes never been away from it the company
is gone the engineers are gone the clerks are
gone the coolies are gone everythings gone
but there he sticks captain davidson com-
ing by from the westward saw him with his
own eyes something white on the wharf so
he steamed in and went ashore in a small boat
heyst right enough put a book into his
pocket always very polite been strolling on
the wharf and reading  i remain in posses-
sion here lie told captain davidson what
i want to know is what he gets to eat there
a piece of dried fish now and then-what
thats coming down pretty low for a man
who turned up his nose at my table dhote

  he winked with immense malice a bell
started ringing and he led the way to the
dining-room as if into a temple very grave
with the air of a benefactor of mankind

iv

   a fewt of us who were sufficiently interested
went to davidson for details they were not
many he told us that he passed to the north
of samburan on purpose to see what was go-
ing on at first it looked as if that side of the
island had been altogether abandoned this
was what he expected

  presently above the dense mass of vegeta-
tion that samburan presents to view he saw
the head of the flagstaff without a flag then
while steaming across the slight indentation
which for a time was known officially as black
diamond bay he made out with his glass the
white figure on the coaling-wharf it could be
no one but heyst

   i thought for certain he wanted to be

taken off so i steamed in he made no signs
however i lowered a boat i could not see
another living being anywhere he had a book
in his hand he looked exactly as we have al-
ways seen him-very neat white shoes cork
helmet he explained to me that he had al-
ways had a taste for solitude it was the first
i ever heard of it i told him he only smiled
what could i say he isnt the sort of man
one can speak familiarly to

     but whats the object are you think-
ing of keeping possession of the mine i asked
him

   something of the sort he says i am
keeping hold

      but all this is as dead as julius cajsar i
cried  in fact you have nothing worth hold-
ing on to heyst

      oh i am done with facts says he put-
ting his hand to his helmet sharply with one
of his short bows

  thus dismissed davidson went on board his
ship swung her out and as he was steaming
away he watched from the bridge heyst walk-
ing shoreward along the wharf he marched
into the long grass and vanished-all but the
top of his white cork helmet which seemed to
swim in a green sea then that too disap-
peared as if it had sunk into the living depths
of the tropical vegetation which is more
jealous of mens conquests than the ocean and
which was about to close over the last ves-
tige of the liquidated tropical belt coal
company-a heyst manager in the east

  davidson a good simple fellow in his way
was strangely affected it is to be noted that
he knew very little of heyst he was one of
those whom heysts finished courtesy of at-
titude and intonation most strongly discon-
certed he himself was a fellow of fine feel-
ing i think though of course he had no more
polish than the rest of us we were naturally
a hail-fellow-well-met crowd with standards
of our own-no worse i dare say than other
peoples but polish was not one of them

  davidsons fineness was real enough to alter
the course of the steamer he commanded in-
stead of passing to the south of samburan he
made it his practise to take the passage along
the north shore within about a mile of the
wharf

   he can see us if he likes to see us re-
marked davidson then he had an after-
thought i say i hope he wont think i
am intruding eh

  we reassured him on the point of correct
behavior the sea is open to all

  this slight deviation added some ten miles
victory



to davidsons round trip but as that was a
matter of sixteen hundred miles it did not
matter much

   i have told my owner of it said the con-
scientious commander

  to serve a chinese firm is not so bad
once they become convinced you deal straight
by them their confidence becomes unlimited
you can do no wrong so davidsons old
chinaman squeaked hurriedly

   all right all right all right you do what
you like captain

  and there was an end of the matter not
altogether though from time to time the
chinaman used to ask davidson about the
white man he was still there eh

   i never see him davidson had to confess
to his owner who would peer at him silently
through round horn-rimmed spectacles sev-
eral sizes too large for his little old face  i
never see him

  to me on occasions he would say

   i havent a doubt hes there he hides
its very unpleasant davidson was a little
vexed with heyst  funny thing he went
on  of all the people i speak to nobody
ever asks after him but that chinaman of
mine -and schomberg he added after a
while

  yes schomberg of course he was asking
everybody about everything and arranging the
information into the most scandalous shape
his imagination could invent

  from time to time he would step up his
blinking cushioned eyes his thick lips his
very chestnut beard looking full of malice

   evening gentlemen have you got all
you want so good well i am told the
jungle has choked the very sheds in black
diamond bay fact hes a hermit in the
wilderness now but what can this manager
get to eat there it beats me

  sometimes a stranger would inquire with
natural curiosity

   who what manager

   oh a certain swede -with sinister em-
phasis as if he were saying  a certain
brigand - well known here hes turned
hermit from shame thats what the devil
does when hes found out

  hermit this was the latest of the more
or less witty labels applied to heyst during
his aimless pilgrimage in this section of the
tropical belt where the inane clacking of
schombergs tongue vexed our ears

  but apparently heyst was not a hermit by
temperament the sight of his kind was not
invincibly odious to him after something

more than a year and a half in samburan he
suddenly reappeared in the world broad chest
bald forehead long mustache polite manner
and all -the complete heyst even to the
kindly sunken eyes on which there still rested
the shadow of morrisons death

  naturally it was davidson who had given
him a lift out of his forsaken island there
were no other opportunities unless some na-
tive craft were passing by-a very remote and
unsatisfactory chance to wait for he came
out with davidson to whom he volunteered
the statement that it was only for a short time
-a few days no more he meant to go back
to samburan

   davidson expressing his horror at such fool-
ishness heyst explained that when the com-
pany came into being he had his few belong-
ings sent out from europe

  to davidson as to any of us the idea of
heyst the wandering drifting unattached
heyst having any belongings of the sort that
can furnish a house was startlingly novel it
was grotesquely fantastic it was like a bird
owning real property

   belongings do you mean chairs and
tables davidson asked with unconcealed
astonishment

  heyst did mean that

   my poor father died in london it was
all stored there ever since he explained

    for all these years exclaimed davidson
thinking how long we all had known heyst flit-
ting from tree to tree in a wilderness

    even longer said heyst who had under-
stood very well

  this seemed to imply that he had been
wandering before he came under our observa-
tion it what regions at what early age
mystery perhaps he was a bird that had
never had a nest

   i left school very early he remarked
once to davidson on the passage  it was
in england a very good school i was not
a shining success there

  the confessions of heyst not one of us
-with the probable exception of morrison
who was dead-had ever heard so much of his
history it looks as if the experience of hermit
life has the power to loosen ones tongue
doesnt it

   during that memorable passage on the sis-
sie which took about two days he volunteered
other hints-for you could not call it informa-
tion-about his history davidson was telling
us all about it afterward heyst said that his
father had written a lot of books he was a
philosopher


munseys magazine

  seems to me he must have been some-
 thing of a crank too was davidson s com-
 ment  apparently he had quarreled with his
 people in sweden just the sort of father you
 would expect heyst to have isnt he a bit of
 a crank himself he told me that directly his
 father died he lit out into the wide world on
 his own and had been on the move till he
 fetched up against this famous coal business
 fits the son of his father somehow dont you
 think great fact that didnt pay eh

   for the rest heyst was as polite as ever
 he offered to pay for his passage but when
 davidson refused to hear of it he seized him
 heartily by the hand gave one of his courtly
 bows and declared that he was touched by his
 friendly proceedings

    i am not alluding to this trifling amount
 which you decline to take he went on giv-
 ing a shake to davidsons hand  but i am
 touched by your humanity another shake

  believe me i am profoundly aware of hav-
 ing been an object of it final shake of the
 hand

   all this meant that heyst understood m a
 proper sense the little sissies periodic ap-
 pearance in sight of his hermitage

    hes a genuine gentleman davidson said
 to ui   i was really sorry when he went
 ashore

   we asked him where he had left heyst

    why in sourabaya-where else

   the tesmans had their principal counting-
 house in sourabaya there had long existed
 a connection between heyst and the tesmans
 the incongruity of a hermit having agents
 did not strike us nor yet the absurdity of
 a forgotten cast-off derelict manager of a
 wrecked collapsed vanished enterprise hav-
 ing business to attend to

     we said sourabaya of course and took it
 for granted that he would stay with one of
 the tesmans one of us even wondered what
 sort of reception he would get for it was
 known that julius tesman was unreasonably
 bitter about the tropical belt coal fiasco
 but davidson set us right it was nothing of
 the kind heyst went to stay in schombergs
 hotel going ashore in the hotel launch

    not that schomberg would think of sending
   his launch alongside a mere trader like the
   sissie but she had been meeting a coasting
   mail-packet and had been signaled to schom-
   berg himself was steering her

    you should have seen schombergs eyes
   bulge out when heyst jumped in with an
   ancient brown leather baj said davidson
    he pretended not to know who it was-at

 first anyway i didnt go ashore with them

 we didnt stay more than a couple of hours
 altogether landed two thousand coconuts
 and cleared out i have agreed to pick him
 up again on my next trip in twenty days
 time

v

   davidson happened to be two days late on
 his return trip no great matter certainly but
 he made a point of going ashore at once dur-
 ing the hottest hour of the afternoon to look
 for heyst

   schomberg s hotel stood back in an exten-
 sive enclosure containing a garden some large
 trees and under their spreading boughs a
 detached hall available for concerts and
 other performances as schomberg worded it
 in his advertisements torn and fluttering
 bills intimating in heavy red capitals  con-
 certs every night were stuck on the brick
 pillars on each side of the gateway

   the walk had been long and confoundedly
 sunny davidson stood wiping his wet neck
 and face on what schomberg called the
 piazza several doors opened on to it but
 all the screens were down not a soul was
 in sight not even a china boy-nothing but a
 lot of painted iron chairs and tables

   solitude shade and gloomy silence-and a
 faint treacherous breeze which came from un-
 der the trees and quite unexpectedly caused
 the melting davidson to shiver slightly-the
 little shiver of the tropics which in sourabaya
 especially often means fever and the hospital
 to the incautious white man

   the prudent davidson sought shelter in the
 nearest darkened room in the artificial dusk
 beyond the levels of shrouded billiard-tables a
 white form heaved up from two chairs on
 which it had been extended the middle of
 the day table dhote tiffin once over was
 schombergs easy time he lounged out port-
 ly deliberate on the defensive the great fair
 beard like a cuirass over his manly chest he
 did not like davidson never a very faithful

 client of his

   he hit a bell on one of the tables as he
 went by and said in a distant officer-of-the-
 reserve manner

    your desire

   the good davidson still sponging his wet
   neck declared with simplicity that he had
   come to fetch away heyst as agreed

    not here

   a chinaman appeared in response to the
   bell schomberg turned to him very severely
   and said
victory



    take the gentlemans order

  davidson had to be going he told schom-
berg couldnt wait-only begged that heyst
should be informed that the sissie would
leave at midnight

  not-here i am telling you

   davidson slapped his thigh in concern
dear me hospital i suppose- a natu-
ral enough surmise in a very feverish locality

   the lieutenant of the reserve only pursed
up his mouth and raised his eyebrows without
looking at him it might have meant any-
thing but davidson dismissed the hospital
idea with confidence however he persisted
in his quest for he had to get hold of heyst
between this and midnight

    he has been staying here- he asked

    yes he was staying here

    can you tell me where he is now david-
son went on placidly

  within himself he was beginning lo grow
anxious having developed the affection of a
self-appointed protector toward heyst the
answer he got w-as

    cant tell its none of my business ac-
 companied by majestic oscillations of the
 hotel-keepers head hinting at some awful
 mystery

   davidson was placidity itself it was his
nature he did not betray his sentiments
which were not favorable to schomberg

   i am sure to find out at the tesmans
office he thought

  but it was a very hot hour and if heyst
was down at the port he would have learned
already that the sissie was in it was even
possible that heyst had already gone on
board where he could enjoy a coolness de-
nied to the town

   davidson being stout was much preoccu-
pied w-ith coolness and inclined to immobility
he lingered a while as if irresolute schom-
berg at the door looking out affected perfect
indifference he could not keep it uo though
suddenly he turned inward and asked with
brusk rage

  you wanted to see him

   why yes said davidson  we agreed
to meet-

    dont you bother he doesnt care about
that now

    doesnt he

    well you can judge for yourself he isnt
 here is he you take my word for it dont
 you bother about him i am advising you as
 a friend

   thank you  said davidson inwardly
startled at the savage tone  i think i will

sit down here for a moment and have a drink
after all

  this was not what schomberg had expected
to hear he called brutally

   boy

  the chinaman approached and after re-
ferring him to the white man by a nod the
hotel-keeper departed muttering to himself
davidson fancied he heard him gnash his
teeth as he went

   davidson sat alone with the billiard-tables
 something had happened and he was loath
 to go away to investigate being restrained by
 a presentiment that somehow enlightenment
 would come to him there

  a poster of  concerts every evening like
those on the gate but in a good state of
preservation hung on the wall fronting him
he looked at it idly and was struck by the
fact-then not so very common-that it was
a ladies orchestra  zangiacomos eastern
tour-eighteen performers the poster stated
that they had had the honor of playing their
select repertoire before various colonial ex-
cellencies also before pashas sheiks chiefs
hh the sultan of mascate et cetera et
cetera

  davidson felt sorry for the eighteen lady
performers he knew what that sort of life
was like the sordid conditions and brutal inci-
dents of such tours led by such zangiacomos
who often were anything but musicians by
profession

  while davidson was staring at the poster a
door somewhere at his back opened and a
woman came in who was looked upon as
schombergs wife no doubt with truth as
somebody remarked cynically once she wras
too unattractive to be anything else the
opinion that he treated her abominably was
based on her frightened expression

  davidson lifted his hat to her mrs
schomberg gave him an inclination of her
sallow head and incontinently sat down be-
hind a sort of raised counter facing the door
with a mirror and rows of bottles at her back
her hair was very elaborately done with two
ringlets on the left side of her scraggy neck
her dress was of silk and she had come on
duty for the afternoon

  for some reason or other schomberg exact-
ed this from her though she added nothing to
the fascinations of the place she sat there
in the smoke and noise like an enthroned
idol smiling stupidly over the billiards from
time to time speaking to no one and no one
speaking to her schombcrg himself took no
more interest in her than may be implied in


munseys magazine

 a sudden and totally unmotived scowl other-
 wise the very chinamen ignored her existence

   she had interrupted davidson in his re-
 flections being alone with her her silence
 and open-eyed immobility made him uncom-
 fortable he was easily sorry for people it
 seemed rude not to take any notice of her

 he said in allusion to the poster

   are you having these people in the
 house

   she was so unused to being addressed by
 customers that at the sound of his voice she
 jumped in her seat davidson was telling us
 afterward that she jumped exactly like a
 figure made of wood without losing her rigid
 immobility she did not even move her eyes
 but she answered him freely though her very
 lips seemed made of wood

   they stayed here a fortnight they are
 gone now they played every evening
 pretty good were they

   to this she said nothing and as she kept
 on staring fixedly in front of her her silence
 disconcerted davidson it looked as if she
 had not heard him-which was impossible
 perhaps she drew the line of speech at the ex-
 pression of opinions schomberg might have
 trained her for domestic reasons to keep 
 them to herself but davidson felt in honor
 obliged to converse with her so he said put-
 ting his own interpretation on this surprising
 silence

    i see-not much account such bands
 hardly ever are an italian lot mrs schom-
 berg to judge by the name of the boss 

   she shook her head negatively

    no he is a german really only he dyes
 his hair and beard black for business zan-
 giacomo is his business name

 thats a curious fact said davidson
 his head being full of heyst it occurred to
 him that she might be aware of other facts
 the other members of that orchestra were
 real italians were they not he asked

    mrs schomberg said they were not they
   were of all sorts apparently  there was
   even one english girl she added

    poor devil said davidson i suppose
   these women are not much better than slaves
   really was that fellow with the dyed beard
   decent in his way

    the mechanism remained silent the sym-
   pathetic soul of davidson drew its own con-
   clusions

     beastly life for these women he said
    when you say an english girl mrs schom-
   bcrg do you really mean a young girl sonje
   of these orchestra girls are no chicks

  young enough came the low voice out of
 mrs schombergs unmoved physiognomy

 davidson encouraged remarked that he
 was sorry for her as has been said he was
 easily sorry for people

 where did they go to from here he
 asked

  she did not go with them she ran away
 this was the pronouncement davidson ob-
 tained next it introduced a new sort of in-
 terest

   well well he exclaimed placidly and
 then with the air of a man who knows life

  who with he inquired with assurance

   mrs schombergs immobility gave her an
 appearance of listening intently perhaps she
 was really listening but schomberg must
 have been finishing his sleep in some distant
 part of the house the silence was profound
 and lasted long enough to become startling
 then enthroned above davidson she whis-
 pered at last

    that friend of yours

    oh you know i am here looking for a
 friend said davidson hopefully wont
 you tell me-

    ive told you

    eh

   a mist seemed to roll away from before
 davidsons eyes disclosing something he
 could not believe

    you cant mean it he cried  hes not
 the man for it but the last words came out
 in a faint voice

   mrs schomberg never moved her head the
 least bit davidson after the shock which
 made him sit up went slack all over

   heyst such a perfect gentleman he
 exclaimed weakly

   mrs schomberg did not seem to have heard
 him

   this startling fact did not tally with the
 idea davidson had of heyst he never talked
 of women he never seemed to think of them
 or to remember that they existed and then
 all at once-like this running off with a
 casual orchestra girl

    you might have knocked me down with a
   feather davidson told us some time after-
   ward

   he confronted our open grins or quiet
   smiles with a serious round face heyst had
   taken the girl away to samburan and that
   was no joking matter the loneliness the
   ruins of the spot had impressed davidsons
   simple soul they were incompatible with the
   frivolous comments of people who had not
   seen it
 

victory

 this black jetty sticking out of the jungle
 into the empty sea these roof-ridges of de-
 serted houses peeping dismally above the long
 grass ough the gigantic and funereal
 blackboard sign of the tropical belt coal
 company still emerging from a wild growth
 of bushes like an inscription stuck above a
 grave added to the general desolation

   thus the sensitive davidson the girl must
 have been miserable indeed to follow a strange
 man to such a spot heyst had no doubt
 told her the truth he was a gentleman but
 no words could do justice to the conditions of
 life on samburan a desert island was noth-
 ing to it

   moreover when you were cast away on a
 desert island-why you could not help your-
 self but to expect a fiddle-playing girl out of
 an ambulant ladies orchestra to remain con-
 tent there for a day for one single day was
 inconceivable she would be frightened at the
 first sight of it

   the capacity for sympathy in these stout
 placid men davidson was stirred to the
 depths and it was easy to see that it was
 about heyst that he was concerned we
 asked him if he had passed that way lately

    oh yes i always do-about half a mile
 off shore

    seen anybody about 

    no not a soul not a shadow

    did you blow your whistle

    blow the whistle you think i would
 do such a thing

   he rejected the mere possibility of such an
 unwarrantable intrusion wonderfully deli-
 cate fellow davidson

    well but how do you know that they are
 there he was naturally asked

   heyst had entrusted mrs schomberg with
 a message for davidson-a few lines in pencil
 on a scrap of crumpled paper it was to the
 effect that an unforeseen necessity was driving
 him away before the appointed time he
 begged davidsons indulgence for the ap-
 parent discourtesy the woman of the house
 -meaning mrs schomberg-would give him
 the facts though unable to explain them of
 course

   what was there to explain wondered
 davidson dubiously  he took a fancy to
 that fiddle-playing girl and-

    and she to him apparently i suggested
    wonderfully quick work reflected david-
   son  what do you think will come of it
    repentance i should say but how is it
   that mrs schomberg has been selected for a
   confidante

 for indeed a waxwork figure would have
 seemed more useful than that woman whom
 we all were accustomed to see sitting elevated
 above the twto billiard-tables - without ex-
 pression without movement without voice
 without sight

    why she helped the girl to bolt said
 davidson turning on me bs innocent eyes
 rounded by the state of constant amazement
 in which this affair had left him

   mrs schomberg jerked heysts note
 twisted like a pipe-light into my lap while i
 sat there unsuspecting davidson went on

  directly i had recovered my senses i asked
 her what on earth she had to do with it that
 heyst should leave it with her and then
 behaving like a painted image rather than a
 live woman she whispered just loud enough
 for me to hear

     i helped them i got her things to-
 gether tied them up in my own shawl and
 threw them into the compound out of a back
 window i did it

    that woman that you would think hadnt
 the pluck to lift her little finger marveled
 davidson in his quiet slightly panting voice

  what do you think of that

   i thought she must have had some interest
 of her own to serve she was too lifeless to
 be suspected of impulsive compassion for the
 girl it was scarcely possible to think that
 heyst had bribed her whatever means he
 had he had not the means to do that or
 could it be that she was moved by that dis-
 interested passion for delivering a woman to
 a man which in respectable spheres is called
 match-making

    it must have been a very small bundle
 remarked davidson further

    i imagine the girl must have been special-
 ly attractive i said

    i dont know she was miserable i dont
 suppose it was more than a little linen and a
 couple of these white frocks they wear on the
 platform

   davidson pursued his own train of thought
 he supposed that such a thing had never been
 heard of in the history of the tropics for
 where could you find any one to steal a girl
 out of an orchestra it needed a lunatic like
 heyst

   only think what it means wheezed
  davidson imaginative under his invincible
  placidity just only try to think brood-
  ing alone on samburan has upset his brain
  how is a thing like that to go on whats
  he going to do with her in the end its
  madness


munseys magazine

   you say that hes mad schomberg tells
us that he must be starving on his island so
he may end yet by eating her i suggested

  mrs schomberg had had no time to enter
into details davidson told us indeed the
wonder was that they had been left alone so
long the drowsy afternoon was slipping by
footsteps and voices resounded on the veran-
da-i beg pardon the piazza-the scraping of
chairs the ping of a smitten bell customers
were turning up

  mrs schomberg was begging davidson hur-
riedly but without looking at him to say
nothing to any one when on a half-uttered
word her nervous whisper was cut short
through a small inner door schomberg came
in his hair brushed his beard combed neatly
hut his eyelids still heavy from his nap he
looked with suspicion at davidson and even
glanced at his wife but he was baffled by the
natural placidity of the one and the acquired
habit of immobility in the other

  have you sent out the drinks he asked
surlily

  she did not open her lips because just then
the head boy appeared with a loaded tray on
his way out schomberg went to the door
and greeted the customers outside but did not
join them he remained blocking half the
doorway with his back to the room and was
still there when davidson after sitting still
for a while rose to go

  at the noise he made schomberg turned his
head watched him lift his hat to mrs schom-
berg and receive her wooden bow accom-
panied by a stupid grin and then looked away
he was loftily dignified davidson stopped
at the door

   i am sorry you wont tell me anything
about my friends absence he said  my
friend heyst you know i suppose the only
course for me now is to make inquiries down
at the port i shall hear something there i
dont doubt

  make inquiries of the devil replied
schomberg in a hoarse mutter

  davidsons purpose in addressing the hotel-
keeper had been mainly to make mrs schom-
berg safe from suspicion but he would fain
have heard something more of heysts exploit
from another point of view it was a shrewd
try it was successful in a rather startling
way because the hotel-keepers point of view
was horribly abusive all of a sudden in the
same hoarse sinister tone he proceeded to call
heyst many names of which  pig-dog  was
not the worst with such vehemence that he
actually choked himself

  profiting from the pause davidson whose
temperament could withstand worse shocks
remonstrated in an undertone

   its unreasonable to get so angry as that
even if he had run off with your cash-box-

  the big hotel-keeper bent down and put his
infuriated face close to davidsons

  my cash-box my-he-look here cap-
tain davidson he ran off with a girl what
do i care for the girl the girl is nothing
to me

  he shot out an infamous word which made
davidson start thats what the girl was and
he reiterated the assertion that she was noth-
ing to him what he was concerned for was
the good name of his house wherever he
had been established he had always had
 artist parties  staying in his house one
recommended him to the others but what
would happen now when it got about that
leaders ran the risk in his house-his house-
of losing members of their troupe and just
now when he had spent seven hundred and
thirty-four guilders in building a concert-hall
in his compound was that a thing to do in
a respectable hotel the cheek the in-
decency the impudence the atrocity vaga-
bond impostor swindler ruffian schwein-
hundl

  he had seized davidson by a button of his
coat detaining him in the doorway and ex-
actly in the line of mrs schombergs stony
gaze davidson stole a glance in that direc-
tion and thought of making some sort of re-
assuring sign to her but she looked so bereft
of senses and almost of life perched up there
that it seemed not worth while he disen-
gaged his button with firm placidity

  thereupon with a last stifled curse schom-
berg vanished somewhere within to try and
compose his spirits in solitude

  davidson stepped out on the veranda the
party of customers there had become aware
of the explosive interlude in the doorway
davidson knew one of these men and nodded
to him in passing but his acquaintance called
out

   isnt he in a filthy temper hes been
like that ever since

  the speaker laughed aloud while all the
others sat smiling davidson stopped

  it seems unreasonable he murmured
thoughtfully

  oh but they had a scrap the other
said

  what do you mean was there a fight-
a fight with heyst asked davidson much
perturbed




victory

  heyst no these two-the band-master
and our schomberg signor zangiacomo ran
amuck in the morning and went for our
worthy friend i tell you they were rolling
on the floor together on this very veranda
after chasing each other all over the house
doors slamming women screaming seventeen
of them in the dining-room chinamen up
the trees-hey john you climb tree to see
fight eh

  the boy almond-eyed and impassive emit-
ted a scornful grunt finished wiping the table
and withdrew

   thats what it was - a real go-as-you-
please fight and zangiacomo began it oh
heres schomberg say schomberg didnt he
fly out at you when the girl was missed be-
cause it was you who insisted that the artists
should go about the audience during the in-
terval

  schomberg had reappeared in the doorway
he advanced his bearing was stately but
his nostrils were extraordinarily expanded
and he controlled his voice with apparent
effort

   certainly that was only business i
quoted him special terms and all for your
sake gentlemen i was thinking of my regu-
lar customers theres nothing to do in the
evenings in this town i think gentlemen
you were all pleased at the opportunity of
hearing a little good music and wheres the
harm of offering a grenadine or what not to
a lady artist but that fellow-that swede-
he got round the girl he got round all the
people out here ive been watching him for
years you remember how he got round
morrison

  he changed front abruptly as if on parade
and marched off the customers at the table
exchanged glances silently davidsons atti-
tude was that of a spectator schombergs
moody pacing of the billiard-room could be
heard on the veranda

  and the funniest part is resumed the
man who had been speaking before-an eng-
lish clerk in a dutch house- the funniest
part is that before nine oclock that same
morning those two were driving together in a
gharry down to the port to look for heyst
and the girl i saw them rushing around ma-
king inquiries i dont know what they would
have done to the girl but they seemed quite
ready to fall upon your heyst davidson and
kill him on the quay

  it appeared that the two investigators en-
tered a steam-launch and went flying from
ship to ship all over the harbor causing no

end of sensation the captains of vessels
coming on shore in due course brought tales
of a strange invasion and wanted to know
who were the two offensive lunatics in a
steam-launch apparently after a man and a
girl and telling a story of which one could
make neither head nor tail their reception
by the roadstead was generally unsympathetic
even to the point of the mate of an american
ship bundling them out over the rail with un-
seemly precipitation

  meantime heyst and the girl were a good
few miles away having gone in the night on
board one of the tesman schooners bound to
the eastward this was known afterward
from the javanese boatmen wfeom heyst hired
for the purpose at three oclock in the morn-
ing the tesman schooner had sailed at day-
light with the usual land breeze and was prob-
ably still in sight in the offing at the time
however the two pursuers after their experi-
ence with the american mate made for the
shore

  on landing they had another violent row
in the german language but there was no
second fight and finally with looks of fierce
animosity they got together into a gharry-
obviously with the frugal view of sharing ex-
penses-and drove away leaving an astonished
little crowd of europeans and natives on the
quay

  after hearing this wondrous tale davidson
went away from the hotel veranda which was
filling with schombergs regular customers
heysts escapade was the general topic of
conversation davidson concluded that peo-
ple liked to discuss that sort of scandal better
than any other

  i asked him if he believed that this was
such a great scandal after all

  heavens no said that excellent man
who himself was incapable of any impropriety
of conduct  but it isnt a thing i would
have done myself i mean even if i had not
been married

  there was no implied condemnation in the
statement rather something like regret
davidson evidently shared my suspicion that
this was in its essence the rescue of a dis-
tressed human being not that we were two
romantics tingeing the world to the hue of
our temperament but that both of us had
been acute enough to discover a long time ago
that heyst was one

   i shouldnt have had the pluck he con-
tinued i see a thing all round as it were
but heyst doesnt or else he would have been
scared you dont take a woman into a




munseys magazine

desert jungle without being made sorry for it
sooner or later in one way or another and
heyst being a gentleman only makes it worse

vi

  we said no more about heyst on that occa-
sion and it so happened that i did not meet
davidson again for some three months when
we did come together almost the first thing
he said to me was

   ive seen him

  before i could exclaim he assured me that
he had taken no liberty that he had not in-
truded he was called in

heyst called you in i asked interested

  yes heyst had called him in as he was go-
ing by on his usual date davidson was ex-
amining the shore through his glasses with his
unwearied and punctual humanity as he
steamed past samburan

   i saw a man in white it could only have
been heyst he had fastened some sort of
enormous flag to a bamboo pole and was
waving it at the end of the old wharf

  davidson didnt like to take his steamer
alongside-for fear of being indiscreet i sup-
pose but he steered close inshore stopped
his engines and lowered a boat he went
himself in that boat which was manned of
course by his malay seamen

  heyst when he saw the boat pulling to-
ward him dropped his signaling-pole and
when davidson arrived he was kneeling down
engaged busily in unfastening the flag from it

 was there anything wrong i inquired

   the very words that came out of my
mouth said davidson  before i laid the
boat against the piles i could not help it

  heyst got up from his knees and began care-
fully folding up the flag thing which struck
davidson as having the dimensions of a
blanket

   no nothing wrong he cried his white
teeth flashed agreeably below the coppery
horizontal bar of his long mustache

  i dont know whether it was his delicacy or
his obesity which prevented davidson from
clambering upon the wharf he stood up in
the boat and above him heyst stooped low
with urbane smiles thanking him and apolo-
gizing for the liberty exactly in his usual
manner

  davidson had expected some change in the
man but there was none nothing in him
betrayed the momentous fact that within that
jungle there was a girl a performer in a
ladies orchestra whom he had carried straight
off the concert platform into the wilderness

he was not ashamed or defiant or abashed
about it

   i took this course of signaling to you
he said to davidson  because to preserve
appearances might be of the utmost import-
ance not to me of course i dont care
what people may say and of course no one
can hurt me i suppose i have done a certain
amount of harm since i allowed myself to be
tempted into action it seemed innocent
enough but all action is bound to be harmful
that is why this world is evil upon the whole
but i have done with it i shall never lift a
little finger again at one time i thought that
intelligent observation of facts was the best
way of cheating the time which is allotted to
us whether we want it or not but now i have
done with observation too

  imagine poor simple davidson being ad-
dressed in such terms alongside an abandoned
decaying wharf jutting out of tropical bush
he had never heard anybody speak like this
before certainly not heyst whose conversa-
tion was concise polite with a faint ring of
playfulness in the cultivated tones of his voice

   hes gone mad davidson thought to
himself

  but looking at the physiognomy above him
on the wharf he was obliged to dismiss the
notion of common crude lunacy it was truly
most unusual talk then he remembered-in
his surprise he had lost sight of it-that heyst
now had a girl there this bizarre discourse
was probably the effect of the girl

  davidson shook off the absurd feeling and
asked wishing to make clear his friendliness
and not knowing what else to say

   you havent run short of stores or any-
thing like that

  heyst smiled and shook his head

   no no nothing of the kind we are
fairly well off here thanks all the same if
i have taken fie liberty to detain you it is
not from any uneasiness for myself and my
-companion the person i was thinking of
when i made up my mind to invoke your as-
sistance is mrs schomberg

   i have talked with her interjected
davidson

  oh you yes i hoped she would find
means to-

   but she didnt tell me much interrupted
davidson who was not averse to hearing
something-he hardly knew what

   h-m-yes but that note of mine yes
she found an opportunity to give it to you
thats good very good shes more resource-
ful than one would give her credit for
victory



   women often are remarked davidson
the strangeness from which he had suffered
merely because his interlocutor had carried off
a girl wore off as the minutes went by
 theres a lot of unexpectedness about wom-
en he generalized with a didactic aim which
seemed to miss its mark for the next tiling
heyst said was

  this is mrs schombergs shawl he
touched the stuff hanging over his arm  an
indian thing  believe he added glancing at
his arm sidewise

   it isnt of particular value said david-
son truthfully

   very likely the point is that it belongs
to schombergs wife that schomberg seems
to be an unconscionable ruffian - dont you
think so

  davidson smiled faintly

   we out here have got used to him he
said as if excusing a universal and guilty
toleration of a manifest nuisance  id hard-
ly call him that  only know him as a hotel-
keeper

   i never knew him even as that-not till
this time when you were so obliging as to lake
me to sourabaya i went to stay there from
economy the netherlands house is very ex-
pensive and they expect you to bring your
own servant with you its a nuisance

   of course of course protested david-
son hastily

  after a short silence heyst returned to the
matter of the shawl he wanted to send it
back to mrs schomberg he said that it
might be very awkward for her if she vmte
unable if asked to produce it this had
given him heyst much uneasiness she was
terrified of schomberg apparently she had
reason to be

   and-she helped me-us he concluded
 she told me so davidson replied  how
did you get round ler heyst why she
looks too stupid to understand human speech
and too scared to shoo a chicken away oh
the women the women you dont know
what there may be in the quietest of them
 she was engaged in the task of defending
her position in life said heyst  its a very
respectable task

   is that it i had some idea it was that
confessed davidson

  he then imparted to heyst the story of the
violent proceedings following on the discovery
of his flight heysts polite attention to the
tale took on a somber cast but he manifested
no surprise and offered no comment when
davidson had finished he handed down the

shawl into the boat and davidson promised
to do his best to relurn it to mrs schomberg
in some secret fashion heyst expressed his
thanks in a few simple words set off by his
manner of finished courtesy

  davidson prepared to depart they were
not looking at each other suddenly heyst
spoke

   you understand that this was a case of
odious persecution dont you i became
aware of it and-

  it was a view which the sympathetic david-
son was capable of appreciating

   i am not surprised to hear it he said
placidly  odious enough i dare say and
you of course-not being a married man-
were free to step in ah well

  he sat down in the stern-sheets and already
had the steering-lines in his hands when heyst
observed abruptly

   the world is a bad dog it will bite you
if you give it a chance but i think that here
we can safely defy the fates

  when relating all this to me davidsons
only comment was

  funny notion of defying the fates-to
take a woman in tow

vii

  soiie considerable time afterward-we did
not meet very often-i asked davidson how he
had managed about the shawl i heard that
he had tackled his mission in a direct way
and had found it easy enough

  at the very first call he made at sourabaya
he rolled the shawl as tightly as he could into
the smallest possible brown - paper parcel
which he carried ashore with him his busi-
ness in the town being transacted he got into
a gharry with the parcel and drove to the
hotel with his previous experience he timed
his arrival accurately for the hour of schom-
bergs siesta

  finding the place empty as on the former
occasion he marched into the billiard-room
took a seat at the back near the sort of dais
which mrs schomberg would in due course
come to occupy and broke the slumbering si-
lence of the house by thumping a bell vigor-
ously of course a chinaman appeared
promptly davidson ordered a drink and sat
tight

   i would have ordered twenty drinks one
after another if necessary he said-david-
sons a very abstemious man- rather than
take that parcel out of the house again
couldnt leave it in a corner without letting
the woman know it was there it might have




munseys magazine

turned out worse for her than not bringing
the thing back at all

  and so he waited ringing the bell again and
again and swallowing two or three iced drinks
which he did not want

  presently as he hoped it would happen
mrs schomberg came in silk dress long
neck ringlets scared eyes and silly grin-all
complete probably that lazy beast had sent
her out to see who was the thirsty customer
waking up the echoes of the house at this
quiet hour bow nod-and she clambered up
to her regular post behind the raised counter
looking so helpless so utterly inane as she
sat there that if it hadnt been for the parcel
davidson declared he would have thought he
had merely dreamed of all that had passed
between them

  he ordered another drink to get the china-
man out of the room then seized the parcel
which was reposing on a chair near him and
with no more than a mutter- this is some-
thing of yours -he rammed it swiftly into a
recess in the counter at her feet the rest
was her affair

  and just in time too schomberg turned
up yawning affectedly almost before david-
son had regained his seat he cast about
suspicious and irate glances an invincible
placidity of expression helped davidson won-
derfully at the moment and the other of
course could have no grounds for the slightest
suspicion of any sort of understanding between
his wife and this customer

  as to mrs schomberg she sat there like a
joss davidson was lost in admiration he
believed now that the woman had been put-
ting it on for years she never even winked
it was immense she was a miracle of dis-
simulation no wonder heyst got the girl
away from under two mens noses if he had
her to help with the job

  presently schomberg wandering about
joined a party that had taken the table next
to davidsons

   a man like that swede gentlemen is a
public danger he began  i remember him
for years i wont say anything of his spy-
ing-well he used to say himself he was
looking for out-of-the-way facts and what is
that if not spying he was spying into every-
bodys business he got hold of captain
morrison squeezed him dry like you would
an orange and scared him off to europe to
die there everybody knows that captain
morrison had a weak chest robbed first and
murdered afterward i dont mince words-
not i next he gets up that swindle of the

belt coal you all know about it and now
after lining his pockets with other peoples
money he kidnaps a white girl belonging to
an orchestra which is performing in my pub-
lic room for the benefit of my pafrons and
goes off to live like a prince on that island
where nobody can get at him its disgust-
ing-tfui

  he spat he choked with rage-for he
saw visions no doubt he jumped up from
his chair and went into the room where mrs
schomberg sat her aspect could not have
been very consoling to the sort of pain from
which he was suffering

  davidson did not feel called upon to de-
fend heyst his proceeding was to enter into
conversation with one and another casually
and showing no particular knowledge of the
affair in order to discover something about
the girl was she anything out of the way
was she pretty

  she couldnt have been markedly so she
had not attracted special notice she was
young-on that everybody agreed the eng-
lish clerk of tesmans remembered that she
had a sallow face he was respectable and
highly proper he was not the sort to asso-
ciate with such people

  most of these women were fairly battered
specimens schomberg had them housed in
what he called the pavilion in the grounds
where they were hard at it mending and wash-
ing their white dresses and could be seen
hanging them out to dry between the trees
like a lot of washerwomen they looked very
much like middle-aged washerwomen on the
platform too but the girl had been living in
the main building along with the boss the
director the fellow with the black beard and
a hard-bitten oldish woman who took the
piano and was understood to be the fellows
wife

  this was not a very satisfactory result
davidson stayed on and even joined the
table dhote dinner without gleaning any
more information he was resigned

   i suppose he wheezed placidly  i am
bound to see her some day

  he meant to take the samburan channel
every trip as before of course

   yes i said  no doubt you will some
day heyst will be signaling to you again and
i wonder what it will be for

  davidson made no reply he had his own
ideas about that and his silence concealed a
good deal of thought we spoke no more of
heysts girl before we separated he gave me
a piece of unrelated observation
victory



    its funny he said  but i fancy theres
 some gambling going on in the evening at
 schombergs place on the quiet ive noticed
 men strolling away in twos and threes toward
 that pavilion where the orchestra used to
 live the windows must be specially well
 shuttered because i could not spy the smallest
 gleam of light from that direction but i cant
 believe that those beggars would go in there
 every evening only to sit and think of their
 sins in the dark

   thats strange i cant believe schom-
berg would risk that sort of thing i said

viii

   as we know heyst had gone to stay in
schombergs hotel in complete ignorance that
his person was odious to that worthy when
he arrived zangiacomos ladies orchestra
had been established there for some time

   the business which had called him out from
his seclusion in his lost corner of the eastern
seas was with the tesmans and it had some-
thing to do with money he transacted it
quickly and then found himself with nothing
to do while he awraited davidson who was to
take him back to his solitude for back to his
solitude heyst meant to go

   he whom we used to refer to as the en-
chanted het was suffering from thorough
disenchantment not with the islands how-
ever the archipelago has a lasting fascina-
tion it is not easy to shake off the spell of
island life heyst was disenchanted with life
as a whole his scornful temperament be-
guiled into action suffered from failure in a
subtle way unknown to men accustomed to
grapple with the realities of common human
enterprise

   it was like the gnawing pain of a useless
apostasy a sort of shame before his own be-
trayed nature and in addition he also suf-
fered from plain downright remorse he
deemed himself guilty of morrisons death

a rather absurd feeling since no one could
possibly have foreseen the horrors of the cold
wet summer lying in wait for poor morrison
at home

   it was not in heysts character to turn
morose but his mental state was not com-
patible with a sociable mood he spent his
evenings sitting apart on the veranda of
schombergs hotel the lamentations of
string instruments issued from the building in
the hotel compound the approaches to which
were decorated with japanese paper lanterns
strung up between the trunks of several big
trees scraps of tunes more or less plaintive

reached his ears they pursued him even into
his bedroom which opened into an up-stairs
veranda

   like most dreamers to whom it is given
sometimes to hear the music of the spheres
heyst the wanderer of the archipelago had
a taste for silence which he had been able to
gratify for years the islands are very quiet
one sees them lying about clothed in their
dark garments of leaves in a great hush of
silver and azure where the sea meets the sky
in a ring of magic stillness a sort of smiling
somnolence broods over them the very voices
of their people are soft and subdued as if
afraid to break some protecting spell

   perhaps this was the very spell which had
enchanted heyst in the early days for him
however that was broken he was no longer
enchanted though he was still a captive of
the islands he had no intention to leave
them ever

   where could he have gone to after all these
 years not a single soul belonging to him
 lived anywhere on earth of this fact-not
 such a remote one after all-he had only late-
 ly become aware for it is failure that makes
 a man enter into himself and reckon his re-
 sources and though he had made up his
 mind to retire from the world in hermit
 fashion yet he was irrationally moved by this
 sense of loneliness which had come to him in
 the hour of renunciation

   meantime schomberg watched him out of
the corner of his eye toward the unconscious
object of his enmity he preserved a distant
lieutenant-of-the-reserve demeanor nudging
certain of his customers with his elbow he
begged them to observe what airs  that
swede  was giving himself

    i really dont know why he has come to
stay in my house this place isnt good
enough for him i wish to goodness he had
gone somewhere else to show off his superi-
ority here i have got up this series of con-
certs for you gentlemen just to make things
a little brighter generally and do you think
liell condescend to step in and listen to a piece
or two of an evening not he there he
sits at the dark end of the piazza all the eve-
ning long-planning some new swindle no
doubt for twopence i would ask him to go
and look for quarters somewhere else only
one doesnt like to treat a white man like that
out in the tropics i dont know how long
he means to stay but im willing to bet a
trifle that hell never work himself up to the
point of spending the fifty cents of entrance
money for the sake of a little good music

thick brown tresses rolled round an attractive-
ly shaped head

  a girl by jove he exclaimed mentally

  it was evident that she was a girl it was
evident in the outline of the shoulders in the
slender white bust springing up barred slant-
wise by the crimson sash from the bell-shaped
spread of muslin skirt hiding the chair on
which she sat averted a little from the body of
the hall her feet in low white shoes were
crossed prettily

  she had captured heysts awakened faculty
of observation he had the sensation of a new
experience that was because his faculty of
observation had never before been captured by
any feminine creature in that marked and ex-
clusive fashion he looked at her anxiously
as no man ever looks at another man and he
positively forgot where he was he had lost
touch with his surroundings

  the big woman advancing concealed the
girl from his sight for a moment she bent
over the seated girlish figure as if to drop a
word into its ear her lips did certainly move
but what sort of word could it have been to
make the girl jump up so swiftly

  heyst at his table was surprised into a
sympathetic start he glanced quickly round
nobody was looking toward the platform and
when his eyes swept back there again the
girl with the big woman treading at her heels
was coming down the three steps from the
platform to the floor of the hall there she
paused stumbled one pace forward and stood
still again while the other-the escort the
dragoon the coarse big woman of the piano-
passed her roughly and marching truculently
down the center aisle between the chairs and
tables went out to rejoin the hook-nosed
zangiacomo somewhere outside

  during her extraordinary transit as if
everything in the hall were dirt under her feet
her scornful eyes met the upward glance of
heyst who looked away at once toward the
girl she had- not moved her arms hung
down her eyelids were lowered

  heyst laid down his half-smoked cigar and
compressed his lips then he rose and walked
up the central passage it was the same sort
of impulse which years ago had made him
cross the sandy street of the abominable town
of delli in the island of timor and accost
morrison practically a stranger to him then
a man in trouble harassed dejected lonely

  several of the women by this had found
an anchorage here and there among the oc-
cupied tables they talked to the men lean-
ing on their elbows and suggesting funnily-

if it hadnt been for the crimson sashes-in
their white dresses an assembly of middle-
aged brides with free and easy manners and
hoarse voices the murmuring noise of con-
versations carried on with some spirit filled
schombergs concert-hall

  nobody remarked heysts movements-for
indeed he was not the only man on his legs
there he had been confronting the girl for
some time before she became aware of his
presence she was looking down very still
without color without glances without voice
without movement it was only when heyst
addressed her in his courteous tone that she
raised her eyes

   excuse me he said in english  but that
horrible female has done something to you
she has pinched you hasnt she i am sure
she pinched you just now when she stood by
your chair

  the girl received this overture with the
wide motionless stare of profound astonish-
ment heyst vexed with himself suspected
that she did not understand what he said
one could not tell what nationality these
women were except that they were of all
sorts but she was astonished almost more
by the near presence of the man himself by
this large bald head by the white brow the
sunburnt cheeks the long horizontal mus-
tache of crinkly bronze hair by the kindly
expression of the mans blue eyes looking into
her own he saw the stony amazement in
hers give way to a momentary alarm which
was succeeded by an expression of resignation

   i am sure she pinched your arm most
cruelly he murmured rather disconcerted
now at what he had done

  it was a great comfort to hear her say

   it wouldnt have been the first time and
suppose she did-what are you going to do
about it

   i dont know he said with a faint re-
mote playfulness in his tone which had not
been heard in it lately and which seemed to
catch her ear pleasantly i am grieved to
say that i dont know but can i do any-
thing what would you wish me to do
pray command me

  again the greatest astonishment became
visible in her face for she now perceived how
different he was from the other men in the
room he was as different from them as she
was different from the other members of the
ladies orchestra

  command you she breathed after a
time in a bewildered tone  who are you
she asked a little louder

magazine

   i am staying in this hotel for a few days
i just dropped in casually here to-night this
outrage-

   dont you try to interfere she said so
earnestly that heyst asked in his faintly play-
ful tone

   is it your wish that i should leave you

   i havent said that the girl answered
 she pinched me because i didnt get down
here quick enough

   i cant tell you how indignant i am said
heyst  but since you are down here now
he went on with the ease of a man of the
world speaking to a young lady in a drawing-
room hadnt we better sit down

  she obeyed his inviting gesture and they
sat down on the nearest chairs they looked
at each other across a little round table with
a surprised open gaze self-consciousness
growing on them so slowly that it was a long
time before they averted their eyes and very
soon they met again temporarily only to re-
bound as it were at last they steadied in
contact but by that time say some fifteen
minutes from the moment when they sat
down the  interval  came to an end

  so much for their eyes as to the con-
versation it had been perfectly insignificant
because naturally they had nothing to say to
each other

  heyst had been interested by the girls
physiognomy its expression was neither sim-
ple nor yet very clear it was not distin-
guished-that could not be expected-but the
features had more fineness than those of any
other feminine countenance he had ever had
the opportunity to observe so closely there
was in it something indefinably audacious and
infinitely miserable-because the temperament
and the existence of that girl were reflected
m it

  but her voice it seduced heyst by its
amazing quality it was a voice fit to utter
the most exquisite things a voice which would
have made silly chatter supportable and the
roughest talk fascinating heyst drank in its
charm as one listens to the tone of some in-
strument without heeding the tune

   do you sing as well as play he asked
her abruptly

   never sang a note in my life she said
obviously surprised by the irrelevant question
she was clearly unaware of her voice  i
dont remember that i ever had much reason
to sing since i was little she added

  that inelegant phrase by the mere vi-
brating warm nobility of sound found its
way into heysts heart his mind cool alert

watched it sink there with a sort of vague
concern at the absurdity of the occupation
till it rested at the bottom deep down where
our unexpressed longings lie

 you are english of course he said
what do you think she answered
 cockney too then as if thinking that it
was her turn lo place a question why do
you always smile when you speak

  it was enough to make any one look grave
but her good faith was so evident that heyst
recovered himself at once

    its my unfortunate manner he said with
his delicate polished playfulness  is it very
objectionable to you

   she was very serious

   no i only noticed it i havent come
across so many pleasant people as all that in
my life

    its certain that this woman who plays the
piano is infinitely more disagreeable than any
cannibal i have ever had to do with

  i believe you she shuddered how
did you come to have anything to do with
cannibals

    it would be too long a tale said heyst
with a faint smile in which his playfulness dis-
appeared heysts smiles were rather melan-
choly and accorded badly with his great
mustache under which his mere playfulness
lurked as comfortably as a shy bird in its
native thicket  much too long how did
you get among this lot here

    bad luck she answered briefly

    no doubt no doubt heyst assented with
slight nods then still indignant at the pinch
which he had divined rather than actually seen
inflicted i say couldnt you defend your-
self somehow

  she had risen already the ladies of the
orchestra were slowly regaining their places
some were already seated idle stony-eyed
before the music-stands heyst was standing
up too

   they are too many for me she said-
these few words came out of the common
experience of mankind yet by virtue of her
voice they thrilled heyst like a revelation

ix

   on a later evening during the interval be-
tween the two parts of the concert the girl
told heyst about herself she w-as almost a
child of the streets her father was a
musician in the orchestras of small theaters
her mother ran away from him while she was
little and the landladies of various poor lodg-
ing-houses had attended casually to her aban-
victory



doned childhood it was never positive starva-
tion and absolute rags but it was the hopeless
grip of poverty all the time

  it was her father who taught her to play
the violin it seemed that he used to get drunk
sometimes but without pleasure and only be-
cause he was unable to forget his fugitive wife
after he had a paralytic stroke and fell over
with a crash in the well of a music-hall or-
chestra during the performance she had joined
the zangiacomo company he was now in a
home for incurables

   and i am here she finished  with no
one to care if i make a hole in the water the
next chance i get or not

  heyst told her that he thought she could do
a little better than that if it was only a ques-
tion of getting out of the world she looked
at him with special attention and with a puz-
zled expression which gave to her face an air
of innocence she had never had a friend be-
fore and the sensation of this friendliness
going out to her was exciting by its novelty
alone

  besides any man who did not resemble
schomberg appeared for that very reason at-
tractive she was afraid of the hotel-keeper
who in the daytime taking advantage of the
fact that she lived in the hotel itself and not
in the pavilion with the other  artists
prowled round her mute hungry portentous
behind his great beard

  the contrast of heysts quiet polished man-
ner gave her special delight and filled her with
admiration she had never seen anything like
that before if she had perhaps known kind-
ness in her life she had never met the forms
of simple courtesy she was interested by it
as by a very novel experience not very in-
telligible but distinctly pleasurable

   i tell you they are too many for me
she repeated sometimes recklessly but more
often shaking her head with ominous dejec-
tion

  she had of course no money at all the
quantities of  black men  all about fright-
ened her she really had no definite idea
where she was on the surface of the globe
the orchestra was generally taken from the
steamer to some hotel and kept shut up there
till it was time to go on board another
steamer she could not remember the names
she heard

   how do you call this place again she
used to ask heyst

   sourabaya he would say distinctly and
would watch the discouragement at the out-
landish sound coming into her eyes which

were fastened on his face he could not de-
fend himself from compassion

  he suggested that she might go to the con-
sul but it was his conscience that dictated this
advice not his conviction she had never
heard of the animal or of its uses a consul
what was it who was he what could he
do and when she learned that perhaps he
could be induced to send her home her head
dropped on her breast

   what am i to do when i get there she
murmured with an intonation so true with an
accent so penetrating-the charm of her voice
did not fail her even in whispering-that
heyst seemed to see the illusion of human
fellowship on earth vanish before the naked
truth of her existence and leave them both
face to face in a moral desert as arid as the
sands of sahara without restful shade with-
out refreshing water

  she leaned slightly over the little table-the
same little table at which they had sat when
they first met each other and with no other
memories but of the stones in the streets her
childhood had known the distress of the
incoherent confused rudimentary impressions
of her travels inspiring her with a vague
terror of the world she said rapidly as one
speaks in desperation

   you do something you are a gentleman
it wasnt i who spoke to you first was it
i didnt begin did i it was you who came
along and spoke to me when i was standing
over there what did you want to speak to
me for i dont care what it is but you must
do something

  her attitude was fierce and entreating at
the same time-clamorous in fact though her
voice had hardly risen above a breath it was
clamorous enough to be noticed heyst on
purpose laughed aloud she nearly choked
with indignation at this brutal heartlessness

   what did you mean then by saying
 command me  she almost hissed

  something hard in his mirthless stare and
a quiet final  all right  steadied her

   i am not rich enough to buy you out he
went on speaking with an extraordinary de-
tached grin even if it were to be done but
i can always steal you

  she looked at him profoundly as if these
words had a hidden and very complicated
meaning

   get away now he said rapidly  and try
to smile as you go

  she obeyed with unexpected readiness and
as she had a set of very good white teeth the
effect of the mechanical ordered smile was

magazine

joyous radiant it astonished heyst no
wonder it flashed through his mind women
can deceive men so completely the faculty
was inherent in them they seemed to be
created with a special aptitude here was a
smile the origin of which was well known to
him and yet it had conveyed a sensation of
warmth had given him a sort of ardor to live
which was very newto his experience

  by this time she was gone from the table
and had joined the other  ladies of the or-
chestra they trooped toward the platform
driven in truculently by the haughty mate of
zangiacomo who looked as if she were re-
straining herself with difficulty from punching
their backs

  zangiacomo followed with his great pen-
dulous dyed beard and short mess-jacket with
an aspect of hangdog concentration imparted
by his drooping head and the uneasiness of his
eyes which were set very close together he
climbed the steps last of all turned about dis-
playing his purple beard to the hall and
tapped with his bow heyst winced in an-
ticipation of the horrible racket it burst out
immediately unabashed and awful at the
end of the platform the woman at the piano
presenting her cruel profile her head tilted
back banged the keys without looking at the
music

  heyst could not stand the uproar for more
than a minute he went out his brain racked
by the rhythm of some more or less hun-
garian dance-music he sought the obscurity
and the peace of his bedroom but they were
not complete the distant sounds of the con-
cert reached his ear faint but still disturbing

  he did not attempt to go to sleep he did
not even unbutton the top button of his tunic
he sat in a chair and mused formerly in
solitude and in silence he had been used to
think clearly and sometimes even profoundly
seeing life outside the flattering optical de-
lusion of everlasting hope of conventional
self-deception of an ever-expected happiness
but now he was troubled a light veil seemed
to hang before his mental vision the awaken-
ing of a tenderness indistinct and confused as
yet toward an unknown woman

  gradually silence a real silence had estab-
lished itself round him the concert was over
the audience had gone the concert-hall was
dark and even the pavilion wrhere the ladies
orchestra slept after its noisy labors showed
not a gleam of light

  heyst suddenly felt restless in all his limbs
as this reaction from the long immobility
would not be denied he humored it by pass-

ing quietly along the back veranda and out
into the grounds at the side of the house into
the black shadows under the trees where the
extinguished paper lanterns were gently swing-
ing their globes like withered fruit

  he paced there to and fro for a long time
a calm meditative ghost in his white-drill suit
revolving in his head thoughts absolutely
novel disquieting and seductive accustoming
his mind to the contemplation of his purpose
in order that by being faced steadily it should
appear praiseworthy and wise for the use of
reason is to justify the obscure desires that
move our conduct impulses passions preju-
dices and follies and also our fears

  he felt that he had engaged himself by a
rash promise to an action big with incalcula-
ble consequences and then he asked himself
if the girl had understood what he meant
who could tell he was assailed by all sorts
of doubts

  raising his head he perceived something
white flitting between the trees it vanished
almost at once but there could be no mistake
he was vexed at being detected roaming like
this in the middle of the night who could
that be it never occurred to him that per-
haps the girl too would not be able to sleep

  he advanced prudently then he saw the
white fantomlike apparition again and next
moment all his doubts as to the state of her
mind were laid at rest because he felt her
clinging to him after the manner of suppliants
all the world over her whispers were so in-
coherent that he could not understand any-
thing but this did not prevent him from
being profoundly moved

   calm yourself calm yourself he mur-
mured in her ear returning her clasp at first
mechanically and afterward with a growing
appreciation of her distressed humanity

  the heaving of her breast and the trem-
bling of all her limbs in the closeness of his
embrace seemed to enter his body to infect
his very heart while she was growing quieter
in his arms he was becoming more agitated
as if there were only a fixed quantity of violent
emotion on this earth the very night seemed
more dumb more still and the immobility of
the vague black shapes surrounding him more
perfect

   it will be all right he tried to reassure
her with a tone of conviction speaking into
her ear and of necessity clasping her more
closely than before

  either the words or the action had a very
good effect he heard a light sigh of relief
she spoke with a calmed ardor
victory



   oh i knew it would be all right from the
first time you spoke to me yes indeed i
knew directly you came up to me that eve-
ning i knew it would be all right if you only
cared to make it so but of course i could
not tell if you meant it  command me you
said funny thing for a man like you to say
did you really mean it you werent ma-
king fun of me

  he protested that he had been a serious per-
son all his life

   i believe you she said ardently he was
touched by this declaration  its the way
you have of speaking as if you were amused
with people she went on  but i wasnt de-
ceived i could see you were angry with that
beast of a woman and you are clever you
spotted something at once you saw it in my
face eh it isnt a bad face-say youll
never be sorry listen-im not twenty yet
its the truth and i cant be so bad-looking
or else-i will tell you straight that i have
been worried and pestered by fellows like this
before i dont know what comes to them-
she was speaking hurriedly she choked
and then exclaimed with an accent of despair
 what is it whats the matter heyst
had removed his arms from her suddenly and
had recoiled a little  is it my fault i
didnt even look at them i tell you straight
never have i looked at you tell me it
was you that began it

  in truth heyst had shrunk from the idea
of competition with fellows unknown with
schomberg the hotel-keeper the vaporous
white figure before him swayed pitifully in
the darkness he felt ashamed of his fas-
tidiousness

   i am afraid we have been detected he
murmured  i think i saw somebody on the
path between the house and the bushes be-
hind you

  he had seen no one it was a compassion-
ate lie if there ever was one his compassion
was as genuine as his shrinking had been and
in his judgment more honorable

  she never turned her head she was
obviously relieved

   would it be that brute she breathed out
meaning schomberg of course  hes getting
too forward with me now what can you ex-
pect only this evening after supper he-
but i slipped away you dont mind him do
you why i could face him myself now that
i know you care for me a girl can always
put up a fight you believe me only it isnt
easy to stand up for yourself when you feel
theres nothing and nobody at your back

theres nothing so lonely in the world as a
girl who has got to look after herself when
i left poor dad in that home-it was in the
country near a village-i came out of the
gate with seven shillings and threepence in
my old purse and my railway ticket i
tramped a mile and got into a train-

  she broke off and was silent for a moment

   dont you throw me over now she went
on  if you did what should i do i should
have to live to be sure because id be afraid
to kill myself but you would have done a
thousand times worse than killing a body you
told me you had always been alone you had
never had a dog even well then i wont be
in anybodys way if i live with you-not even
a dogs and what else did you want when
you came up and looked at me so close

  close did i he murmured unstirring
before her in the profound darkness  so
close as that

  she had an outbreak of anger and despair
in subdued tones

  have you forgotten then what did you
expect to find i know what sort of girl i
am but all the same i am not the sort that
men turn their backs on-and you ought to
know it unless you arent made like the others
oh forgive me you arent like the others
you are like no one in the world i ever spoke
to dont you care for me dont you
see-

  what he saw was that white and spectral
she was putting out her arms to him out of
the black shadows like an appealing ghost he
took her hands and was affected almost sur-
prised to find them so warm so real so firm
so living in his grasp he drew her to him
and she dropped her head on his shoulder with
a deep sigh

   i am dead tired she whispered plain-
tively

  he put his arms round her and only by
the convulsive movements of her body became
aware that she wras sobbing without a sound
sustaining her he lost himself in the profound
silence of the night

  after a while she became still and cried
quietly then suddenly as if waking up she
asked

   you havent seen any more of that some-
body you thought was spying about

  he started at her quick sharp whisper and
answered that very likely he had been mis-
taken

   if it was anybody at all she reflected
aloud  it wouldnt have been any one but
that hotel woman-the landlords wife


munseys magazine

   mrs schomberg heyst said surprised
 yes another one that cant sleep o
nights why dont you see why because
of course she sees whats going on that
beast doesnt even try to keep it from her
if she had only the least bit of spirit she
knows how i feel too only shes too fright-
ened even to look him in the face let alone
open her mouth he would tell her to go
hang herself

  for some time heyst said nothing a pub-
lic active contest with the hotel-keeper was
not to be thought of the idea was altogether
too unpleasant whispering gently to the girl
he tried to explain to her that as things stood
an open withdrawal from the company would
probably be opposed she listened to his ex-
planation anxiously from time to time press-
ing the hand she had sought and got hold of
in the dark

  as i told you i am not rich enough to
buy you out so i shall steal you as soon as
i can arrange some means of getting away
from here meantime it would be fatal to
be seen together at night we mustnt give
ourselves away we had better part at once
i think i was mistaken just now but if as
you say that poor mrs schomberg cant sleep
of nights we must be more careful she
would tell the fellow

  the girl had disengaged herself from his
loose hold while he talked and now stood free
of him but still clasping his hand firmly

   oh no she said with perfect assurance
 i tell you she darent open her mouth to
him and she isnt as silly as she looks she
wouldnt give us away she knows a trick
worth two of that shell help-thats what
shell do if she dare do anything at all

   you seem to have a very clear view of
the situation said heyst and received a
warm lingering kiss for this commendation

  he discovered that to part from her was
not such an easy matter as he had supposed
it would be

   upon my word he said before they sep-
arated i dont even know your name

   dont you they call me alma i dont
know why silly name magdalen too it
doesnt matter you can call me by whatever
name you choose yes you give me a name
think of one you would like the sound of-
something quite new how i should like to
forget everything that has gone before as one
forgets a dream thats done with fright and
all i would try

   would you really he asked in a mur-
mur  but thats not forbidden i under-

stand that women easily forget whatever in
their past diminishes them in their eyes

   its your eyes that i was thinking of for
im sure ive never wished to forget anything
till you came up to me that night and looked
me through and through i know im not
much account but i know how to stand by a
man i stood by father ever since i could un-
derstand he wasnt a bad chap now that
i cant be of any use to him i would just as
soon forget all that and make a fresh start
but these arent things that i could talk to
you about what could i ever talk to you
about 

   dont let it trouble you heyst said
 your voice is enough i am in love with
it whatever it says

  she remained silent for a while as if ren-
dered breathless by this quiet statement

   oh i wanted to ask you-

  he remembered that she probably did not
know his name and expected the question to
be put to him now but after a moment of
hesitation she went on

   why is it that you told me to smile this
evening in the concert-room there-you re-
member

   i thought we were being observed a
smile is the best of masks schomberg was
at a table next but one to us drinking with
some dutch clerks from the town no doubt
he was watching us-watching you at least
thats why i asked you to smile

  ah thats why it never came into my
head

   and you did it very well too-very read-
ily as if you had understood my intention

   readily she repeated  oh i was ready
ehough to smile then thats the truth it
was the first time for years i may say that i
felt disposed to smile ive not had many
chances to smile in my life i can tell you-
especially of late

   but you do it most charmingly-in a per-
fectly fascinating way

  he paused she stood still waiting for
more with the stillness of extreme delight
wishing to prolong the sensation

   it astonished me he added  it went as
straight to my heart as if you had smiled for
the purpose of dazzling me i felt as if i had
never seen a smile before in my life i thought
of it after i left you it made me restless

   it did all that came her voice unsteady
gentle and incredulous

   if you had not smiled as you did i should
not have come out here to-night he said
with his playful earnestness of tone
victory



  he felt her ups touch his lightly and the
next moment she was gone her white dress
gleamed in the distance and then the opaque
darkness of the house seemed to swallow it
heyst waited a little while before he went the
same way round the corner of the hotel up
the steps of the veranda and into his room
where he lay down at last-not to sleep but
to go over in his mind all that had been said
at their meeting

   its exactly true about that smile he
thought there he had spoken the truth to
her and about her voice too for the rest
-what must be must be

  a great wave of heat passed over him he
turned on his back flung his arms crosswise
on the broad hard bed and lay still open-
eyed under the mosquito-net till daylight en-
tered his room brightened swiftly and turned
to unfailing sunlight

  he got up then went to a small looking-
glass hanging on the wall and stared at him-
self steadily it was not a new-born vanity
which induced this long survey he felt so
strange that he could not resist the suspicion
of his personal appearance having changed
during the night

  what he sawin the glass however was the
man he knew before it was almost a disap-
pointment-a belittling of his recent experi-
ence and then he smiled at his naiveness
for being over five and thirty years of age he
ought to have known that in most cases the
body is the unalterable mask of the soul which
even death itself changes but little till it is
put out of sight where no changes matter any
more either to our friends or to our enemies

x

  for fifteen years heyst had wandered in-
variably courteous and unapproachable and in
return generally considered a  queer chap
he had started off on these travels of his after
the death of his father an expatriated swede
dissatisfied with his country and angry with
all the world which had instinctively rejected
his wisdom

  thinker stylist and man of the world in
his time the elder heyst had begun by covet-
ing all the joys those of the great and those
of the humble those of the fools and those of
the sages for more than sixty years he had
dragged on this painful earth of ours the most
weary the most uneasy soul that civilization
had ever fashioned to its ends of disillusion
and regret one could not refuse him a meas-
ure of greatness for he was unhappy in a way
unknown to mediocre souls

  his mother heyst had never known but he
kept his fathers pale distinguished face in
affectionate memory he remembered him
mainly in an ample blue dressing-gown in a
large house of a quiet london suburb for
three years after leaving school at the age of
eighteen he had lived with the elder heyst
who was then writing his last book in this
work at the end of his life he claimed for
mankind that right to absolute moral and in-
tellectual liberty of which he no longer be-
lieved them worthy

  three years of such companionship at that
plastic and impressionable age were bound to
leave a profound mistrust of life the young
man had learned to reflect which is a destruc-
tive process a reckoning of the cost it is not
the clear-sighted who lead the world great
achievements are accomplished in a blessed
warm mental fog which the pitiless cold
blasts of the fathers analysis had blown away
from the son

   ill drift heyst had said to himself de-
liberately

  he did not mean intellectually or sentimen-
tally or morally he meant to drift altogether
and literally body and soul like a detached
leaf drifting in the wind-currents under the
immovable trees of a forest glade to drift
without ever catching on to anything

   this shall be my defense against life he
had said to himself with a sort of inward con-
sciousness that for the son of his father there
was no other worthy alternative

  he became a waif and stray austerely
from conviction as others do through drink
from vice from some weakness of character
-with deliberation as others do in despair
this stripped of its facts had been heysts
life up to that disturbing night

  next day when he saw the girl called alma
she managed to give him a glance of frank
tenderness quick as lightning and leaving a
profound impression a secret touch on the
heart it was in the grounds of the hotel
about tiffin-time while the ladies of the or-
chestra were strolling back to their pavilion
after rehearsal or practise or whatever they
called their morning musical exercises in the
hall

  heyst returning from the town where he
had discovered that there would be difficulties
in the way of getting away at once was cross-
ing the compound disappointed and worried
he had walked almost unwittingly into the
straggling group of zangiacomos performers
it was a shock to him on coming out of his
brown study to find the girl so near him as


munseys magazine

if one waking suddenly should see the figure
of his dream turned into flesh and blood she
did not raise her shapely head but her glance
was no dream thing it was real-the most
real impression of his detached existence-
so far

  heyst had not acknowledged it in any way
though it seemed to him impossible that its
effect on him should not be visible to any one
who happened to be looking on and there
were several men on the veranda steady cus-
tomers of schombergs table dhote gazing in
his direction-at the ladies of the orchestra
in fact heysts dread arose not out of shame
or timidity but from his fastidiousness

  on getting among them however he noticed
no signs of interest or astonishment on their
faces any more than if they had been blind
men even schomberg himself who had to
make way for him at the top of the stairs
was completely unperturbed and continued
the conversation he was carrying on with a
client

  schomberg indeed had observed  that
swede  talking with the girl in the intervals
a crony of his had nudged him and he had
thought that it was so much the better the
silly fellow would keep everybody else off he
watched them out of the corner of his eye
with a malicious enjoyment of the situation-
a sort of satanic glee for the hotel-keeper
had little doubt of his personal fascination
and still less of his power to get hold of the
girl who seemed too ignorant to know how
to help herself and who was worse than friend-
less since she had for some reason incurred
the animosity of mrs zangiacomo a woman
with no conscience

  schomberg had told alma as an argument
that she was a clever enough girl to see that
she could do no better than to put her trust
in a man of substance in the prime of life
who knew his way about but for the excited
trembling of his voice and the extraordinary
way in which his eyes seemed to be starting
out of his crimson hirsute countenance such
speeches had every character of calm unselfish
advice - which after the manner of lovers
passed easily into sanguine plans for the
future

   well soon get rid of the old woman he
whispered to her hurriedly with panting feroci-
ty  hang her ive never cared for her
the climate dont suit her i shall tell her to
go to her people in europe she will have to
go too i will see to it eins zwei march
and then we shall sell this hotel and start an-
other somewhere else

  he assured her that he didnt care what he
did for her sake and it was true fifty is
the age of recklessness for many men as if in
defiance of the decay and death waiting with
open arms in the sinister valley at the bottom
of the inevitable hill

  her shrinking form her downcast eyes
when she had to listen to him cornered at the
end of an empty corridor he regarded as signs
of submission to the overpowering force of his
will the recognition of his personal fascina-
tions for every age is fed on illusions lest
men should renounce life early and the human
race come to an end

  it is easy to imagine schombergs humilia-
tion his shocked fury when he discovered that
the girl who had for weeks resisted his attacks
his prayers and his fiercest protestations had
been snatched from under his nose by  that
swede apparently without any trouble worth
speaking of he refused to believe the fact
he would have it at first that the zangia-
comos for some unfathomable reason had
played him a scurvy trick but when no fur-
ther doubt was possible he changed his view
of heyst the despised swede became for
schomberg the deepest the most dangerous
the most hateful of scoundrels

  it became a recognized entertainment to gc
and hear his abuse of heyst while sipping iced
drinks on the veranda of the hotel it was in
a manner a more successful draw than the
zangiacomo concerts had ever been-intervals
and all there was never any difficulty in
starting the performer off anybody could do
it by almost any distant allusion

  as likely as not he would begin his endless
denunciations in the very billiard-room where
mrs schomberg sat enthroned as usual swal-
lowing her sobs concealing her tortures of ab-
ject humiliation and terror under her stupid
set everlasting grin which having been pro-
vided for her by nature was an excellent
mask inasmuch that nothing-not even death
itself perhaps-could tear it away

  but nothing lasts in this world at least
without changing its physiognomy so after
a few weeks schomberg regained his outward
calm as if his indignation had dried up within
him and it was time he was becoming a
bore with his inability to talk of anything else
but heysts unfitness to be at large heysts
wickedness his wiles his astuteness and even
his criminality

   if that ass keeps on like this he will end
by going crazy one of his customers an
elderly man had remarked one evening

  and this belief was less than half wrong
victory



schomberg had heyst on the brain even the
unsatisfactory state of his affairs which had
never been so unpromising since he came out
east directly after the franco-prussian war
he referred to some subtly noxious influence of
heyst it seemed to him that he could never
be himself again till he had got even with that
artful swede

  he was ready to swear that heyst had
ruined his life at fifty a disappointment like
the one from which he suffered may well wear
such an aspect the girl so unfairly craftily
basely decoyed away would have inspired him
to success in a new start he had grown gen-
erally neglectful but with a partiality for
reckless expedients as if he did not care when
and how his career as a hotel-keeper was to be
brought to an end

  this demoralized state accounted for what
davidson had observed on his last visit to the
schomberg establishment some three or four
months after heysts secret departure with the
girl to the solitude of samburan

  the schomberg of a few years ago-the
schomberg of the bangkok days for instance
when he started the first of his famed table
dhote dinners-would never have risked any-
thing of the sort his genius ran to catering
white man for white men and to the invent-
ing elaborating and retailing of scandalous
gossip with asinine unction and impudent de-
light but now his mind was perverted by the
pangs of wounded vanity and of thwarted
passion

  in this state of moral weakness schomberg
allowed himself to be corrupted

xi

  the business was done by a guest who ar-
rived one fine morning by mail-boat-immedi-
ately from celebes having boarded her in
macassar but generally schomberg under-
stood from up china sea way a wanderer
clearly even as heyst was but not alone and
of quite another kind

  schomberg looking up from the stern-sheets
of his steam-launch which he used for board-
ing passenger ships on arrival discovered a
dark sunken stare plunging down on him over
the rail of the first-class part of the deck he
was no great judge of physiognomy he was
out there on business a human being was but
an  account from that point of view hu-
man beings for him were either the objects
of scandalous gossip or else the recipients of
narrow strips of paper with proper bill-heads
stating the name of his hotel- w schom-
berg proprietor accounts settled weekly

  so in the clean-shaven extremely thin face
hanging over the mail-boats rail schomberg
saw only the face of a possible  account
the steam-launches of his rivals were also
alongside but he had the preference

   you are mr schomberg arent you the
face had asked quite unexpectedly

   i am at your service he had answered
from below for business is business and its
forms and formulas must be observed even if
ones manly bosom is tortured by that dull
rage which succeeds the fury of baffled pas-
sion like the glow of embers after a fierce
blaze

  presently the possessor of the handsome but
emaciated face was seated beside schomberg
in the stern-sheets of the hotel steam-launch
his body was long and loose-jointed his slen-
der fingers intertwined clasped the leg resting
on his knee as he lolled back in a careless yet
tense attitude on the other side of schom-
berg sat another passenger who was introduced
by the clean-shaven man as-

  my secretary he must have the room
next to mine

   we can manage that easily for you
schomberg steered with dignity staring
straight ahead but very much interested by
these two promising accounts their be-
longings a couple of large leather trunks
browned by age and a few smaller packages
were piled up in the bow

  a third individual - a nondescript hairy
creature-had modestly made his way forward
and had perched himself on the luggage the
lower part of his physiognomy was over-
developed his narrow and low forehead unin-
telligently furrowed by horizontal wrinkles
surmounted wildly hirsute cheeks and a flat
nose with wide baboonlike nostrils there
was something equivocal in the appearance of
his shaggy hair-smothered humanity

  he too seemed to be a follower of the
clean-shaven man and apparently had traveled
on deck with native passengers sleeping under
the awnings his broad squat frame denoted
great strength grasping the gunwales of the
launch he displayed a pair of remarkably long
arms terminating in thick brown hairy paws
of simian aspect

   wtiat shall we do with that fellow of
mine the chief of the party asked schom-
berg  there must be a boarding-house some-
where near the port-some grog-shop where
they could let him have a mat to sleep on
schomberg said there was a place kept by a
chinaman

  a servant of yours he asked


munseys magazine

    well he hangs on to me he is an alliga-
 tor-hunter i picked him up in colombia you
 know ever been in colombia

  no said schomberg very much sur-
 prised  an alligator-hunter funny trade
 are you coming from colombia then

    yes but i have been coming for a long
  time i come from a good many places i
 am traveling west you see

    for sport perhaps suggested schomberg
  yes sort of sport what do you say
 to chasing the sun

    i see-a gentleman at large said schom-
 berg watching a sailing canoe about to cross
 his bow and ready to clear it by a touch of
 the helm

   the other passenger made himself heard
 suddenly

   hang these native craft they always
 get in the way

   he was a muscular short man with eyes
 that gleamed and blinked a harsh voice and
 a leaden pock-marked face ornamented by a
 thin disheveled mustache sticking out quaint-
 ly under the tip of a rigid nose schomberg
 made the reflection that there was nothing
 secretarial about him both he and his long
 lank principal wore the usual white suit of the
 tropics cork helmets pipe-clayed white shoes
 -all correct the hairy nondescript creature
 perched on their luggage in the bow had a
 check shirt and blue dungaree trousers he
 gazed in their direction from forward in an
 expectant trained-animal manner

    you spoke to me first said schomberg
 in his manly tones you were acquainted
 with my name where did you hear of me
 gentlemen may i ask

    in manila answered the gentleman at
 large readily  from a man with whom i
 had a game at cards one evening in the hotel
 castille

  what man ive no friends in manila
 that i know of wondered schomberg with a
 severe frown

    i cant tell you his name ive clean for-
 gotten it but dont you worry he was any-
 thing but a friend of yours he called you all
 the names he could think of he said you
 set a lot of scandal going about him once
 somewhere-in bangkok i think yes thats
 it you were running a table dhote in bang-
 kok at one time werent you

   schomberg astounded by the turn of the
 information could only throw out his chest
 more and exaggerate his austere lieutenant-of-
 the-reserve manner a table dhote yes
 certainly he always-for the sake of white

men and here in this place too yes in
this place too

   thats all right then the stranger
turned his black cavernous mesmerizing
glance away from the bearded schomberg
who sat gripping the brass tiller in a sweating
palm  many people in the evening at your
place

  schomberg had recovered somewhat

   twenty covers or so take one day with
another he answered feelingly as befitting a
subject on which he was sensitive  ought to
be more if only people would see that its for
their own good precious little profit i get
out of it you are partial to table dhotes
gentlemen

  the new guest made answer that he liked a
hotel where one could find some local people
in the evening it was infernally dull other-
wise the secretary in sign of approval emit-	
ted a grunt of astonishing ferocity as if pro-
posing to himself to eat the livers of the local
people

  all this sounded like a longish stay thought
schomberg satisfied under his grave air till
remembering the girl snatched away from him
by the last guest who had made a prolonged
stay in his hotel he ground his teeth so audibly
that the other two looked at him in wonder

the momentary convulsion of his florid physi-
ognomy seemed to strike them dumb they
exchanged a quick glance

  presently the clean-shaven man fired out
another question in his curt unceremonious
manner

   you have no women in your hotel eh

   women schombergexclaimed indignant-
ly but also as if a little frightened  what
on earth do you mean by women what
women theres mrs schomberg of course
he added suddenly appeased with lofty in-
difference

   if she knows how to keep her place then
it will do i cant stand women near me

they give me the horrors declared the other

they are a perfect curse

  during this outburst the secretary wore a
savage grin the chief guest closed his sunken
eyes as if exhausted and leaned the back of
his head against the stanchion of the awning

in this pose his long feminine eyelashes were
very noticeable and his regular features sharp
line of the jaw and well-cut chin were brought
into prominence giving him a sort of used-up
weary depraved distinction

  he did not open his eyes till the steam-
launch touched the quay then he and the
other man got ashore quickly entered a
victory



gharry and drove away to the hotel leaving
schomberg to look after their luggage and
take care of their strange companion the
latter looking more like a performing bear
abandoned by his showmen than a human
being followed all schombergs movements
step by step close behind his back muttering
to himself in a language that sounded like
some sort of uncouth spanish

  the hotel-keeper felt uncomfortable till at
last he got rid of him at an obscure den where
a very clean portly chinaman standing serene-
ly in the doorway seemed to understand ex-
actly how to deal with clients of every kind
he took from the creature the strapped bundle
it had been hugging closely through all its
peregrinations in that strange town and cut
short schombergs attempts at explanation by
a most confident-

   velly good velly good me savee plenty

   its more than i do thought schomberg
going away thankful at being relieved of the
alligator-hunters company he wondered
what these fellows were without being able
to form a guess of sufficient probability their
names he learned that very day by direct
inquiry- to enter in my books he explained
in his formal military manner chest thrown
out beard very much in evidence

  the shaven man lounging in a long chair
with his air of withered youth raised his eyes
languidly

   my name oh plain mr jones-put that
down-a gentleman at large and that is
ricardo the pock-marked man lying pros-
trate in another long chair made a grimace
as if something had tickled the end of his
nose but did not come out of his supineness
 martin ricardo secretary you dont want
any more of our history do you eh what
occupation put down well-tourists weve
been called by harder names before now it
wont hurt our feelings and that fellow of
mine-where did you tuck him away oh
he will be all right when he wants anything
hell take it hes peter citizen of colom-
bia peter pedro-i dont know that he ever
had any other name pedro alligator-hunter
oh yes-ill pay his board with the china-
man cant help myself hes so confounded-
ly devoted to me that if i were to give him
the sack he would fly at my throat shall i
tell you how i killed his brother in the wilds
of colombia well perhaps some other time

  its a rather long story what i shall alwavs
regret is that i didnt kill him too i could
have done it without any extra trouble then
now its too late great nuisance but hes

useful sometimes i hope you are not going
to put all this in your book

  the offhand hard manner and the con-
temptuous tone of plain mr jones dis-
concerted schomberg utterly he had never
been spoken to like this in his life he shook
his head in silence and withdrew not exactly
scared-though he was in reality of a timid
disposition under his manly exterior-but dis-
tinctly mystified and impressed

xii

  three weeks later after putting his cash-
box away in the safe which filled with its iron
bulk a corner of their bedroom schomberg
turned toward his wife but without looking
at her exactly and said

   i must get rid of these two it wont do
mrs schomberg had entertained that very
opinion from the first but she had been
broken years ago into keeping her opinions to
herself sitting in her night attire in the light
of a single candle she was careful not to make
a sound knowing from experience that her
very assent would be resented with her eyes
she followed the figure of schomberg clad in
his sleeping-suit and moving restlessly about
the room

  he never looked her way for the reason
that mrs schomberg in her night attire
looked the most unattractive object in exist-
ence-miserable insignificant faded crushed
old and the contrast with the feminine form
he had ever in his minds eye made his wifes
appearance painful to his esthetic sense

  schomberg walked about swearing and
fuming for the purpose of screwing his cour-
age up to the sticking point

   hang me if i dont go now at once this
minute into his bedroom and tell him to be
off-him and that secretary of his-early in
the morning i dont mind a round game of
cards but to make a decoy of my table dhote
-my blood boils he came here because
some lying rascal in manila told him i kept a
table dhote
he said these things not for mrs schom-
bergs information but simply thinking aloud
and trying to work his fury up to a point
where it would give him courage enough to
face  plain mr jones

   impudent overbearing swindling sharp-
er he went on  i have a good mind to-
though his eyes strayed about irresolutely
yet his swollen angry features awakened in
the miserable woman over whom he had been
tyrannizing for years a fear for his precious
carcass since the poor creature had nothing


munsey s magazine

else but that to hold onto in the world she
knew him well but she did not know him
altogether the last thing a woman will con-
sent to discover in a man whom she loves or
on whom she simply depends is want of cour-
age and timid in her corner she ventured
to say pressingly

  be careful wilhelm remember the

 	knives and revolvers in their trunks

   in guise of thanks for that anxious reminder
 he swore horribly in the direction of her
 shrinking person in her scanty night-dress
 and barefooted she seemed like a medieval
 penitent being reproved for her sin in blas-
 phemous terms

   those lethal weapons were always present
to schombergs mind personally he had
never seen them his part some three weeks
before had been to lounge in manly careless
attitudes on the veranda-on the watch-
while mrs schomberg provided with a bunch
of assorted keys her discolored teeth chatter-
ing and her globular eyes absolutely idiotic
with fright was  going through  the luggage
of these strange clients her terrible wilhelm
had insisted on it

    ill keep good watch i tell you he said
  i shall give you a whistle when i see them
 coming back even if he were to catch you
 at it and chuck you out by the scruff of the
 neck it wouldnt hurt you much but he wont
 touch a woman not he he has told me
 so affected beast i must find out some-
 thing about their little game and so theres
 an end of it go in go now quick
 march

   it had been an awful job but she did go
in because she was much more afraid of
schomberg than of any possible consequences
of the act the trunks she found had been
left open but her investigation did not last
long she was frightened of firearms and
generally of all weapons not exactly from
personal cowardice but from an abstract
horror of violence and murder she was out
again on the veranda long before wilhelm
had any occasion to sound his warning whistle
and nothing could induce her to return to her
investigations-neither threatening growls nor
ferocious hisses nor yet a poke or two in
the ribs

  stupid female muttered the hotel-
keeper perturbed by the notion of that
armory in one of his bedrooms this was
from no abstract sentiment with him it was
constitutional get out of my sight he
snarled  go and dress yourself for the
tabic dhote

  left to himself schomberg had meditated
what did this mean his thinking processes
were sluggish and spasmodic but suddenly
the truth came to him

   by heavens they are desperadoes he
thought

  just then he beheld  plain mr jones  and
his secretary with the ambiguous name of
ricardo entering the grounds of the hotel
they had been down to the port on some
business and now were returning mr jones
lank spare opening his long legs with angular
regularity like a pair of compasses the other
stepping out briskly by his side

  conviction entered schombergs heart they
were two desperadoes-no doubt about it
but as the funk which he experienced was
merely a general sensation he managed to put
on his most severe officer-of-the-reserve man-
ner long before they had closed in with him

   good morning gentlemen

  being answered with curiously derisive
civility he became confirmed in his sudden
conviction of their desperate character the
way mr jones turned his hollow eyes on one
like an incurious specter and the way the
other when addressed suddenly retracted his
lips and exhibited his teelh without looking
round-here was evidence enough to settle
that point desperadoes they passed
through the billiard-room inscrutably mys-
terious to the back of the house to join their
violated trunks

   tiffin bell will ring in five minutes gentle-
men schomberg called after them exaggera-
ting the deep manliness of his tone

  he had managed to upset himself very
much he dreaded any kind of disturbance-
 fracas he called it - in his hotel such
things were not good for business of course
sometimes one had to have a fracas but
it had been a comparatively trifling task to
seize the frail zangiacomo-whose bones were
no larger than a chickens-round the ribs lift
him up bodily dash him to the ground and
fall on him it had been easy the wretched
hook-nosed creature lay without movement
buried under its purple beard

  suddenly remembering the occasion of that
 fracas schomberg groaned with the pain as
of a hot coal under his breast-bone and gave
himself up to desolation ah if he only had
that girl with him he would have been master-
ful and resolute and fearless - fight twenty
desperadoes - care for nobody on earth
whereas the possession of mrs schomberg
was no incitement to a display of manly
virtues
victory



  he sat gloomily through the tiffin

  extreme resolutions at the age of fifty are
seldom final they settle nothing they
merely unsettle the action which at that time
of life should follow the cold dictates of ma-
tured wisdom in his state of moral decom-
position schomberg master as he was of the
art of hotel-keeping and careful of giving no
occasion for criticism to the powers regulating
that branch of human activities let things
take their course though he saw very well
where that course was tending

  it began first with a game or two after din-
ner-for the drinks apparently-with some
lingering customer at one of the little tables
ranged against the walls of the billiard-room
schomberg detected the meaning of it at
once thats what it was this was what
they were

  moving about restlessly he cast sidelong
looks at the game but he said nothing it
was not worth while having a row with men
who were so overbearing even when money
appeared in connection with these post-
prandial games into which more and more
people were being drawn he still refrained
from raising the question

  one evening however after the public
rooms of the hotel had become empty schom-
berg made an attempt to grapple with the
problem in an indirect way

  in a distant corner the tired chinaman
dozed on his heels his back against the wall
mrs schomberg had disappeared as usual
between ten and eleven schomberg walked
about slowly in and out of the room and
the veranda thoughtful waiting for his two
guests to go to bed then suddenly he ap-
proached them militarily his chest thrown
out his voice curt and soldierly

  hot night gentlemen

  mr jones lolling back idly in a chair
looked up ricardo as idle but more up-
right at a little table made no sign

   wont you have a drink with me before
retiring went on schomberg sitting down
bruskly by the little table

   by all means said mr jones lazily

  ricardo showed his teeth in a strange
quick grin schomberg felt painfully how
difficult it was to get in touch with these men
both so quiet so deliberate so menacingly un-
ceremonious he ordered the chinaman to
bring in the drinks his purpose was to dis-
cover how long these guests intended to stay

  ricardo displayed no conversational vein
but mr jones appeared communicative
enough his voice somehow matched his


sunken eyes it was hollow without being in
the least mournful it sounded distant unin-
terested as if he were speaking from the bot-
tom of a well schomberg learned that he
would have the privilege of lodging and board-
ing these gentlemen for at least a month more
he could not conceal his discomfiture at this
piece of news

   whats the matter dont you like to
have people in your house asked plain mr
jones languidly  i should have thought the
owner of a hotel would be pleased

  he lifted his delicate and beautifully pen-
ciled eyebrows schomberg muttered some-
thing about the locality being dull and unin-
teresting to travelers-nothing going on-too
quiet altogether but he only provoked the
declaration that quiet had its charms some-
times and even dulness was welcome as a
change

   we havent had time to be dull for the
last three years added plain mr jones his
eyes fixed darkly on schomberg whom he
furthermore invited to have another drink
this time with him and not to worry himself
about things he did not understand and es-
pecially not to be inhospitable-which in a
hotel-keeper was highly unprofessional

   i dont understand grumbled schom-
berg  oh yes i understand perfectly well
i-

   you are frightened interrupted mr
jones  what is the matter

   i dont want any scandal in my place
thats whats the matter

  schomberg tried to face the situation brave-
ly but that steady black stare affected him
it seemed to watch for his words with un-
fathomable intentions and when he glanced
aside uncomfortably he met ricardos grin
uncovering a lot of formidable teeth though
the man seemed absorbed in his thoughts all
the time

  and moreover went on mr jones in
that distant tone of his  you cant help
yourself here we are and here we stay
would you try to put us out i dare say
you could do it but you couldnt do it with-
out getting badly hurt-very badly hurt we
can promise him that cant we martin

  the secretary retracted his lipst and looked
up sharply at schomberg as if only too anx-
ious for an order to leap upon him with teeth
and claws

  schomberg managed to produce a deep
laugh

  ha ha ha

  mr jones closed his eyes wearily as if the


munseys magazine

light had hurl them and looked remarkably
like a corpse for a moment this was bad
enough bul when he opened them again it
was almost a worse trial for schombergs
nerves the spectral intensity of that glance
fixed on the hotel-keeper without any definite
expression seemed to dissolve the last grain
of resolution in his character

   you dont think by any chance that you
have to do with ordinary people do you in-
quired mr jones in his lifeless manner which
seemed to imply some sort of menace from
beyond the grave

   hes a gentleman testified martin
ricardo with a sudden snap of the lips after
which his mustache stirred in an odd feline
manner

   oh i wasnt thinking of that said mr
jones while schomberg dumb and planted
heavily in his chair looked from one to the
other leaning forward a little  of course
i am that but ricardo attaches too much
importance to such a social advantage what
i mean for instance is that he quiet and
inoffensive as you see him sitting here would
think nothing of setting fire to this house of
entertainment of yours it would blaze like a
box of matches think of that it wouldnt
advance your affairs much would it-what-
ever happens to us

   come come gentlemen remonstrated
schomberg in a murmur  this is very wild
talk

   and you have been used to deal with tame
people havent you but we arent tame
we once kept a whole angry town at bay for
two days and then we got away with our
plunder it was in venezuela ask martin
here-he can tell you

  instinctively schomberg looked at ricardo
who only passed the tip of his tongue over his
lips with an uncanny sort of gusto but did
not offer to begin

   well perhaps it would be a rather long
story mr jones conceded after a short
silence

   i have no desire to hear it i am sure
said schomberg  this isnt venezuela you
wouldnt get away from here like that but
all this is silly talk of the worst sort do you
mean to say you would make deadly trouble
for the sake of a few guilders that you and
that other -eying ricardo suspiciously as
one would look at a strange animal- gentle-
man can win of an evening tisnt as if my
customers were a lot of rich men with pockets
full of cash i winder you take so much
trouble and risk for so little money

  schombergs argument was met by mr
joness statement that he lived in this peculiar
way did what he was doing and stayed
where he was not wanted not from any con-
siderations of profit but to please his humor
ricardo needed to keep himself in practise
and then one must do something to kill time
killing time was not forbidden for the rest
being in a communicative mood mr jones
said languidly and in a voice indifferent as if
issuing from a tomb that he depended on
himself as if the world were still one great
wild jungle without law martin was some-
thing like that too-for reasons of his own

  all these statements ricardo confirmed by
short inhuman grins schomberg lowered his
eyes for the sight of these two men intimi-
dated him but he was losing patience

   of course i could see at once that you
were two desperate characters-something like
what you say why are you trying to frighten
me now theres no necessity its nothing
to me but what would you think if i told
you that i am pretty near as desperate as you
two gentlemen that schomberg has an
easy time running his hotel people think
and yet it seems to me i would just as soon
let you rip me open and burn the whole show
as not there

  a low whistle was heard it came from
ricardo and was derisive schomberg breath-
ing heavily looked on the floor he was
really desperate mr jones was languidly
skeptical

  tut tut you have a tolerable business
you are perfectly tame you- he paused
then added in a tone of disgust you have
a wife

  schomberg angrily tapped the floor with his
foot and uttered an indistinct laughing curse

   what do you mean by flinging that trouble
at my head he cried i wish you would
carry her off with you somewhere to the devil
i wouldnt run after you

  this unexpected outburst affected mr jones
strangely he had a horrified recoil chair and
all as if schomberg had thrust a wriggling
viper in his face

   whats this infernal nonsense he mut-
tered thickly what do you mean how
dare you

  ricardo chuckled audibly

   i tell you i am desperate schomberg
repeated  i am as desperate as any man
ever was i dont care a hang what happens
to me

   well then -mr jones began to speak
with a quietly threatening effect as if the
victory



common words of daily use had some other
deadly meaning to his mind- well then why
should you make yourself ridiculously dis-
agreeable to us if you dont care as you
say you might just as well let us have the
key of that music-shed of yours for a quiet
game a modest bank-a dozen candles or so
it would be greatly appreciated by your
clients as far as i can judge from the way
they bet on a game of ecarte i had with
that fair baby-faced man-whats his name
they just yearn for a modest bank and i
am afraid martin here would take it badly if
you objected but of course you wont
think of the calls for drinks

   schombergs small reserve of resistance was
worn out this slow lifeless voice dropping
words without passion without insistence
affected his imagination with thoughts of
death and graveyards and powers from an-
other world the cadaverous coloring of mr
jones his slow spectral way of turning his
eyes on one suggested that he had been resur-
rected and was now going about not exactly
alive but animated by the power of some
abominable magic

  there were moments when mr jones gave
that impression strongly enough to make one
shudder at other times he was nothing worse
than a very thin gentleman with a perfectly
smooth livid countenance and regular fea-
tures like the head of a statue

   schomberg raising his eyes at last met the
gleams in two dark caverns under mr joness
devilish eyebrows directed upon him impene-
trably he shuddered as if horrors worse than
murder had been lurking there and said nod-
ding toward ricardo

   i dare say he wouldnt think twice about
sticking me if he had you at his back i wish
i had sunk my launch and gone to the bot-
tom myself in her before i boarded that
steamer you came by ah well ive been
living in hell for weeks so you dont make
much difference ill let you have the concert -
room-and hang the consequences but what
about the china boy on late duty if he sees
cards and actual money passing he will be
sure to blab and it will be all over the town
in no time

  a ghastly smile stirred the lips of mr
jones

   ah i see you want to make a success of
it very good thats the way to get on
dont let it disturb you you chase all the
chinamen to bed early and well get pedro
here every evening he hasnt the conven-
tional waiters cut but he will do to run to

and fro with the tray while you sit here from
nine to eleven serving out drinks and gather-
ing the money

   there will be three of them now thought
the unlucky schomberg

  but pedro at any rate was just a simple
straightforward brute if a murderous one
there was no mystery about him nothing un-
canny no suggestion of a stealthy deliberate
wildcat turned into a man or of an insolent
specter on leave from hades endowed with
skin and bones and a subtle power of creating
terror besides schomberg could no longer
help himself

   that will do very well he consented
mournfully  but mind gentlemen if you
had turned up here only three months ago-
aye less than three months ago-you would
have found somebody very different from
what i am now to talk to you its true
what do you think of that

   i scarcely know what to think i should
think it was a lie you were probably ae
tame three months ago as you are now yfth
were born tame like most people hu-r in
world

  mr jones got up spectrally and ricibly
imitated him with a snarl and a strfcsd
schomberg in a brown study went on as n
to himself

   there has been an orchestra here-eight-
een women

  mr jones let out an exclamation of dis-
may and looked about as if the walls around
him and the whole house had been infected
with plague then he became very angry and
swore violently at schomberg for daring to
bring up such subjects

  the hotel-keeper was too much surprised to
get up he gazed from his chair at mr
joness anger which had nothing spectral in
it but was not the more comprehensible for
that

   whats the matter he stammered out
what subject didnt you hear me say it
was an orchestra theres nothing wrong in
that well there was a girl among them-
schombergs eyes went stony he clasped his
hands in front of his breast with such force
that his knuckles were white such a girl
tame am i i would have kicked everything
to pieces about me for her then a fellow
bewitched her-a vagabond a false lying
swindling underhand stick-at-nothing brute
ah

  his entwined fingers cracked as he tore his
hands apart flung out his arms and leaned
his forehead on them in a passion of fury


munseys magazine

the other two men looked at his shaking back
-the attenuated mr jones with mingled
scorn and a sort of fear ricardo with the ex-
pression of a cat which sees a piece of fish in
the pantry out of reach

  schomberg flung himself backward he
was dry-eyed but he gulped as if swallowing
sobs

   no wonder you can do with me what you
like you have no idea-just let me tell you
of my trouble-

    i dont want to know anything of your
beastly trouble said mr jones in his most
lifelessly positive voice

  he stretched forth an arresting hand and
as schomberg remained open-mouthed he
walked out of the billiard-room in all the un-
canniness of his thin shanks ricardo fol-
lowed at his leaders heels but he showed his
teeth to schomberg over his shoulder

jfrom that evening dated those mysterious
i -l significant phenomena in schombergs es-
inofthment which attracted captain david-
thinkcasuai notice when he dropped in placid
enteslute n order to return mrs schom-
bs indian shawl

  it was a curious and impressive sight the
inside of schombergs concert-hall encum-
bered at one end by a great stack of chairs
piled up on and about the musicians platform
and lighted at the other by two dozen candles
disposed about a long trestle table covered
with green cloth in the middle mr jones
a starved specter turned into a banker faced
ricardo a rather nasty slow-moving cat
turned into a croupier

  by contrast the other faces round that
table anything between twenty and thirty
must have looked like collected samples of in-
tensely helpless humanity - pathetic in their
innocent watch for the small turns of luck
they had no notice to spare for the hairy
pedro carrying a tray with the ciumsiness of
a creature caught in the woods and taught to
walk on its hind legs

  as to schomberg he kept out of the way
as much as possible he remained in the
billiard-room serving out drinks to the un-
speakable pedro with an air of not seeing the
growling monster of not knowing where the
drinks went of being unaware that there was
such a thing as a music-room over there under
the trees within fifty yards of the hotel he
submitted himself to the situation with a
low-spirited stoicism compounded of fear and
resignation

  as soon as the party had broken up he
would withdraw out of sight behind a door not
quite closed in order to avoid meeting his two
extraordinary guests but he would watch
through the crack their contrasted forms pass
through the billiard-room and disappear on
their way to bed then he would shudder
pull himself together and creep out with
movements strangely inappropriate to the
lieutenant-of-the-reserve bearing by which he
tried to keep up his self-respect

  a great loneliness oppressed him one after
another he extinguished the lamps and moved
softly toward his bedroom he lay awake a
long time and his slumbers when they cam
were unsatisfactory and short the morning
light had no joy for his eyes he listened
dismally to the movements in the house the
chinamen were unlocking and flinging wide
the doors of the public rooms which opened
on the veranda horrors another poisoned
day to get through somehow

  the recollection of his resolve made him
feel actually sick for a moment first of all
the lordly abandoned attitude of mr jones
disconcerted him then there was his con-
temptuous silence mr jones never addressed
himself to schomberg with any general re-
marks never spoke to him unless to say
 good morning -two simple words which
uttered by that man seemed a mockery of a
threatening character and lastly there was
the strange fear that he inspired it was not
a frank physical fear-for as to that even
a cornered rat will fight-but a superstitious
shrinking awe something like an invincible
repugnance to seek speech with a wicked
ghost

  the fact that it was a daylight ghost sur-
prisingly angular in his attitudes and for the
most part spread out on three chairs did not
make it any easier daylight only made him
a more weird disturbing and unlawful ap-
parition strangely enough in the evening
when he came out of his mute supineness this
unearthly side of him was less obtrusive at
the gaming-table when actually handling the
cards it was probably sunk quite out of sight
but schomberg having made up his mind in
ostrichlike fashion to ignore what was going
on never crossed the threshold of the dese-
crated music-room he had never seen mr
jones in the exercise of his vocation-or per-
haps it was only his trade

   i will speak to him to-night schomberg
said to himself while he drank his morning
tea in pajamas on the veranda before the
rising sun had topped the trees of the com-
victory



pound and while the undried dew still lay
silvery on the grass  thats what ill do
i wont keep out of sight to-night i shall
come out and catch him as he goes to bed
carrying the cash-box

  after all what was thelellow but a common
desperado murderousf oh yes murder-
ous enough perhaps - and the muscles of
schombergs stomach had a quivering con-
traction under his airy attire but even a
common desperado would think twice or
more likely a hundred times before openly
murdering an inoffensive citizen in a civilized
european-ruled town

  he shuddered again and paddled back lo his
room to dress himself his mind was made
up and he would think no more about it but
still he had his doubts they grew and un-
folded themselves with the progress of the
day as some plants do at times they made
him perspire more than usual and they did
away with the possibility of his afternoon
siesta after turning over on his couch more
than a dozen times he gave up his attempt to
repose got up and went down-stairs

  it was between three and four oclock the
hour of profound peace the very flowers
seemed to doze on their stalks set with sleepy
leaves not even the air stirred for the sea
breeze was not due till later the servants
were out of sight catching naps in the shade
somewhere behind the house mrs schom-
berg in a dim up-stairs room with closed
jalousies was elaborating those two long pen-
dent ringlets which were such a feature of her
hair-dressing for her afternoon duties at that
time no customers ever troubled the repose of
the establishment

  wandering about his premises in profound
solitude schomberg recoiled at the door of
the billiard-room as if he had seen a snake
in his path all alone with the billiards the
bare little tables and a lot of untenanted
chairs mr secretary ricardo sat near the
wall performing with lightning rapidity some-
thing that looked like tricks with his own per-
sonal pack of cards which he always carried
about in his pocket

  schomberg would have backed out quietly
if ricardo had not turned his head having
been seen the hotel-keeper elected to walk in
as the lesser risk of the two the conscious-
ness of his inwardly abject attitude toward
these men caused him always to throw his
chest out and assume a severe expression
ricardo watched his approach clasping the
pack of cards in both hands

   you want something perhaps suggested

schomberg in his lieutenant-of-the-reserve
voice

  ricardo shook his head in silence and looked
expectant with him schomberg exchanged at
least twenty words every day he was in-
finitely more communicative than his patron
at times he looked very much like an ordinary
human being of his class and he seemed to
be in an amiable mood at that moment sud-
denly spreading some ten cards face down-
ward in the form of a fan he thrust them
toward schomberg

   come man take one quick

  schomberg obeyed martin ricardos eyes
gleamed phosphorescent in the half light of the
room screened from the heat and glare of the
tropics

   thats a king of hearts youve got he
chuckled showing his teeth in a quick flash

  schomberg after looking at the card ad-
mitted that it was and slowly laid it down on
the table

   i can make you take any card i like nine
times out of ten exulted the secretary with
a strange curl of his lips and a green flicker in
his raised eyes

  schomberg looked down at him dumbly
for a few seconds neither of them stirred
then ricardo lowered his glance and opening
his fingers let the whole pack fall on the
table

  schomberg sat down he sat down because
of the faintness in his legs and for no other
reason his mouth was dry

  having sat down he felt that he must
speak he squared his shoulders in parade
style

   you are pretty good at that sort of tiling
he said

   practise makes perfect replied the secre-
tary his precarious amiability made it im-
possible for schomberg to get away  thus
from his very timidity the hotel-keeper found
himself engaged in a conversation the thought
of which had filled him with apprehension

  it must be said in justice to schomberg
that he concealed his funk very creditably
the habit of throwing out his chest and speak-
ing in a severe voice stood him in good stead
with him too practise made perfect and he
would probably have kept it up to the end
to the very last moment to the ultimate in-
stant of breaking strain which would leave
him groveling on the floor

  to add to his secret trouble he was at a
loss what to say he found nothing else but
the remark

   i suppose you are fond of cards


munseys magazine

   what would you expect asked ricardo
in a simple philosophical tone  is it likely
i should not be  then with sudden fire
 fond of cards aye passionately

   i suppose youve always been so-from
your early youth

  ricardos eyes remained cast down his
fingers toyed absently with the pack on the
table

   i dont know that it was so early i first
got in the way of it playing for tobacco-in
forecastles of ships you know-common sailor
games we used to spend whole watches be-
low at it round a chest under a slush lamp
we would hardly spare the time to get a bite
of salt-horse-neither eat nor sleep we could
hardly stand when the watches were mustered
on deck talk of gambling he dropped
the reminiscent tone to add the information
 i was bred to the sea from a boy you know
schomberg had fallen into a reverie but
without losing the sense of impending calami-
ty the next words he heard were

   i got on all right at sea too worked
up to be mate i was mate of a schooner-
a yacht you might call her-a special good
berth too in the gulf of mexico a soft job
that you dont run across more than once in
a lifetime yes i was mate of her when i
left the sea to follow him

  ricardo tossed up his chin to indicate the
room above from which schomberg his wits
painfully aroused by this reminder of mr
joness existence concluded that the latter
had withdrawn into his bedroom ricardo
observing him from under lowered eyelids
went on

   it so happened that we were shipmates
   mr jones you mean is he a sailor too
  ricardo raised his eyelids at that

   hes no more mr jones than you are he
said with obvious pride hes a sailor
that just shows your ignorance but there
a foreigner cant be expected to know any
better i am an englishman and i know a
gentleman at sight i should know one drunk
in the gutter in jail under the gallows
theres a something-it isnt exactly the ap-
pearance its a-no use me trying to tell you
you aint an englishman and if you were
you wouldnt need to be told

  an unsuspected stream of loquacity had
broken its dam somewhere deep within the
man had diluted his fiery blood and softened
his pitiless fiber schomberg experienced a
mingled relief and apprehension as if sudden-
ly an enormous savage cat had begun to wind
itself about his legs in inexplicable friendliness

  no prudent man under such circumstances
would dare to stir schomberg didnt stir
ricardo assumed an easy attitude with an
elbow on the table schomberg staring at
him began to feel interested and squared his
shoulders afresh without a word

   i was employed in that there yacht-
schooner whatever you call it-by ten gentle-
men at once that surprises you eh yes
yes ten leastwise there were nine of them
gents good enough in their way and one down-
right gentleman and that was-

  ricardo gave another upward jerk of his
chin

   and no mistake he went on  i spotted
him from the first day how why aye
you may ask i hadnt seen that many gentle-
men in my life well somehow i did if you
were an englishman you would-

   what was your yacht schomberg inter-
rupted as impatiently as he dared for this
harping on nationality jarred on his already
tried nerves  what was the game

  you have a head-piece on you game
xactly thats what it was-the sort of silli-
ness gentlemen will get up among themselves
it was a treasure-hunting expedition each
of them put down so much money you under-
stand to buy the schooner their agent in
the city engaged me and the skipper the
greatest secrecy and all that i reckon he
had a twinkle in his eye all the time-and no
mistake but that wasnt our business let
them bust their money as they like the pity
of it was that so little of it came our way
just fair pay and no more and confound any
pay much or little anyhow-thats what i
say

  he blinked his eyes greenishly in the dim
light the heat seemed to have stilled every-
thing in the world but his voice he swore
at large abundantly in snarling undertones it
was impossible to say why then calmed down
no less inexplicably and went on again as a
sailor yarns

   at first there were only nine of them ad-
venturous sparks then just a day or two be-
fore the sailing date he turned up heard of
it somehow somewhere-i should say from
some woman if i didnt know him as i do
he would give any woman a ten-mile berth
he cant stand them anyway the agent net-
ted him in all right-cash down and only
about four and twenty hours for him to get
ready but he didnt miss his ship not he
you might have called it a pier-head jump-
for a gentleman i saw him come along
know the west india docks eh
victory



  schomberg did not know the west india
docks ricardo looked at him in pensive
wonder for a while and then continued as if
such ignorance had to be disregarded

   our tug was already alongside two
loafers were carrying his dunnage behind him
i told the dockmen at our moorings to keep
all fast for a minute the gangway was down
already but he made nothing of it up he
jumps one leap swings his long legs over the
rail and there he is on board they pass up
his swell dunnage and he put his hand in his
trouser-pocket and throws all his small change
on the wharf for them chaps to pick up they
were still promenading that wharf on all fours
when we cast off it was only then that he
looked at me-quietly you know in a slow-
way he wasnt so thin then as he is now
but i noticed he wasnt so young as he looked
-not by a long chalk he seemed to touch
me inside somewhere i went away pretty
quick from there i was wanted forward any-
how jee-miny if anybody had told me we
should be partners before the year was out-
well i would have-

  he swore a variety of strange oaths some
common others quaintly horrible to schom-
bergs ears but all intended as mere innocent
exclamations of wonder at the shifts and
changes of human fortune schomberg moved
slightly in his chair but the admirer and
partner of  plain mr jones  seemed to have
forgotten the hotel-keepers existence for the
moment

  schomberg shuffled his feet the stream of
ingenious blasphemy - some of it in bad
spanish-had run dry and martin ricardo
connoisseur in gentlemen sat dumb with a
stony gaze as if still marveling inwardly at
the amazing elections conjunctions and as-
sociations of events which influence mans
pilgrimage on this earth

  at last schomberg spoke tentatively

   and so the - the gentleman up there
talked you over into leaving a good berth

  ricardo started

  talked me over didnt need to talk me
over he just beckoned to me and that was
enough by that time we were in the gulf
of mexico one night we were lying at
anchor close to a dry sand-bank-to this day
i am not sure where it was-off the yucatan
coast or thereabouts we were to start dig-
ging the next morning and all hands had
turned in early expecting a hard day with
the shovels i was on deck when up he
comes and in his quiet tired way of speaking
-you can tell a gentleman by that as much

as by anything else almost-up he comes be-
hind me and says just like that

    well and what do you think of our
treasure-hunt now

   i didnt even turn my head xactly as i
stood i remained and i spoke no louder than
himself

     if you want to know sir its nothing but
just infernal tomfoolery

   we had of course been having short talks
together at one time or another during the
passage i dare say he had read me like a
book there aint much to me except that i
have never been tame even when walking the
pavement and cracking jokes and standing
drinks to chums-aye and to strangers too
i would watch them lifting their elbows at
my expense or splitting their sides at my fun
-i can be funny when i like you bet

  a pause for self-complacent contemplation
of his own generosity checked the flow of
ricardos speech schomberg was concerned
to keep within bounds the enlargement of his
eyes which he seemed to feel growing bigger
in his head

   yes yes he whispered hastily

  i would watch them and think you
boys dont know who i am if you did-
with girls too once i was courting a girl
i used to kiss her behind the ear and say to
myself  if you only know whos kissing
you my dear you would scream and bolt
ha ha not that i wanted to do them any
harm but i felt the power in myself now
here we sit friendly like and thats all right
you arent in my way but i am not friendly
to you i just dont care you are no more
to me one way or another than that fly there
just so id squash you or leave you alone i
dont care what i do

  if real force of character consists in over-
coming our sudden weaknesses schomberg
displayed plenty of that quality at the men-
tion of the fly he reenforced the severe dig-
nity of his attitude as one inflates a collapsing
toy balloon with a great effort of breath the
easy-going relaxed attitude of ricardo was
really appalling

   thats so he went on  i am that sort
of fellow you wouldnt think it would you
no you have to be told so i am telling
you and i dare say you only half believe it
takes a real gentleman to sec through a fel-
low oh yes-he spotted me i told you
we had a few talks at sea about one thing or
another and i used to watch him down the
skylight playing cards in the cuddy with the
others they had to pass the time away


munseys magazine

somehow by the same token he caught me
at it once and it was then that i told him i
was fond of cards-and generally lucky in
gambling too yes he had sized me up why
not a gentlemans just like any other man
-and something more

  it flashed through schombergs mind that
these two were indeed well matched in their
enormous dissimilarity identical souls in dif-
ferent disguises

   says he to me -ricardo started again in
a gossiping manner-  im packed up its
about time to go martin

   it was the first time he called me martin
says i

     is that it sir

    you didnt think i was after that sort
of treasure did you i wanted to clear out
from home quietly its a pretty expensive
way of getting a passage across but it has
served my turn

   i let him know very soon that i was game
for anything from pitch-and-toss to wilful
murder in his company

    wilful murder says he in his quiet way

	what the deuce is that what are you talk-
ing about people do get killed sometimes
when they get in ones way but thats self-
defense-you understand

   i told him i did and then i said i
would run below for a minute to ram a few
of my things into a sailors bag that i had
ive never cared for a lot of dunnage i be-
lieved in going about flying light when i was
at sea i came back and found him strolling
up and down the deck as if he were taking
a breath of fresh air before turning in like
on any other evening

    ready

     yes sir

   he didnt even look at me we had had
a boat in the water astern ever since we came
to anchor in the afternoon he throws the
stump of his cigar overboard

  can you get the captain out on deck
he asks

   that was the last thing in the world i
should have thought of doing i lost my
tongue for a moment

     i can try says i

    well then i am going below you get
him up and keep him with you till i come
back on deck mind dont let him go be-
low till i return

   i could not help asking why he told me
to rouse a sleeping man when we wanted
everybody on board to sleep sweetly till we
got clear of the schooner he laughs a little

and says that i didnt see all the bearings of
this business

    mind he says  dont let him leave you
till you see me come up again he puts his
eyes close to mine  keep him with you at
all costs

    and that means says i

    all costs to him-by every possible or
impossible means i dont want to be inter-
rupted in my business down below he would
give me lots of trouble i take you with me
to save myself trouble iq various circum-
stances and youve got to enter on your
work right away

  just so sir says i and he slips down
the companion

   with a gentleman you know at once where
you are but it was a ticklish job the skip-
per was nothing to me one way or another
any more than you are at this moment mr
schomberg you may light your cigar or blow
your brains out this minute and i dont care
a hang which you do both or neither to
bring the skipper up was easy enough i had
only to stamp on the deck a few times over
his head i stamped hard but how to keep
him up when he got there

  anything the matter mr ricardo 
heard his voice behind me

  there he was and i hadnt thought of
anything to say to him so i didnt turn round
the moonlight was brighter than many a day
i could remember in the north sea

    why did you call me what are you
staring at out there mr ricardo

   he was deceived by my keeping my back
to him i wasnt staring at anything but his
mistake gave me a notion i hope he hasnt
run up against anything since to prevent him
dying quietly in his bed of old age

    i am staring at something that looks like
a canoe over there i said very slowly

   the skipper got concerned at once it
wasnt any danger from the inhabitants who-
ever they were

   oh hang it says he thats very un-
fortunate dashed awkward with the busi-
ness we have in hand to have a lot of niggers
watching operations but are you certain this
is a canoe

    it may be a drift-log i said  but i
thought you had better have a look with your
own eyes you may make it out better than
i can

   nothing strange in seeing drift-logs off a
coast like that and im hanged if the skipper
didnt make one out in the wake of the moon
strange what a little thing a mans life hangs
victory



on sometimes-a single word here you are
sitting unsuspicious before me and you may
let out something unbeknown to you that
would settle your hash not that i have any
ill feeling i have no feelings if the skip-
per had said oh bosh and had turned his
back on me he would not have gone three
steps toward his bed but he stood there and
stared and now the job was to get him off
the deck when he was no longer wanted there

    we are just trying to make out if that
object there is a canoe or a log says he to
mr jones

   mr jones had come up lounging as care-
lessly as when he went below while the
skipper was jawing about boats and drifting
logs i asked by signs from behind if i hadnt
better knock him on the head and drop him
quietly overboard the night was slipping by
and we had to go it couldnt be put off till
next night and do you know why

  schomberg made a slight negative sign with
his head this direct appeal annoyed him
jarred on the induced quietude of a great
talker forced into the part of a listener mr
ricardo struck a note of scorn

   dont know why cant you guess no
because the boss had got hold of the skip-
pers cash-box by then see

xiv

  a common thief

  schomberg bit his tongue just too late and
woke up completely as he saw ricardo retract
his lips in a catlike grin but the companion of
 plain mr jones  didnt alter his comfort-
able gossiping attitude

   gam what if he did want to see his
money back like any tame shopkeeper hash-
seller gin-slinger or ink-spewer does fancy
a mud-turtle like you trying to pass an opinion
on a gentleman a gentleman isnt to be
sized up so easily even i aint up to it some-
times for instance that night all he did
was to waggle his finger at me the skipper
stops his silly chatter surprised

  eh whats the matter asks he

  the matter it was his reprieve-thats
what was the matter

    oh nothing nothing says my gentle-
man you are perfectly right a log-
nothing but a log

  ha ha reprieve i call it because if
the skipper had gone on with his silly argu-
ment much longer he would have had to be
knocked out of the way i could hardly hold
myself in on account of the precious minutes
however his guardian angel put it into his

head to shut up and go back to his bed i
was ramping mad about the lost time

    why didnt you let me give him one on
his silly coconut sir i asks

     no ferocity no ferocity he says raising
his finger at me as calm as you please

    you cant tell how a gentleman takes that
sort of thing they dont lose their temper
its bad form youll never see him lose his
temper-not for anybody to see anyhow
ferocity aint good form either-that much
ive learned by this time and more too ive
had that schooling that you couldnt tell by
my face if i meant to rip you up the next
minute-as of course i could do in less than
a jiffy i have a knife up the leg of my
trousers

  you havent exclaimed schomberg in-
credulously

  mr ricardo was as quick as lightning in
changing his lounging idle attitude for a
stooping position and exhibiting the weapon
with one jerk at the left leg of his trousers
schomberg had just a view of it strapped to
a very hairy limb when mr ricardo jumping
up stamped his foot to get the trouser-leg
down and resumed his careless pose with one
elbow on the table

   its a more handy way to carry a tool
than you would think he went on gazing
abstractedly into schombergs wide-open eyes
 suppose some little difference comes up dur-
ing a game well you stoop to pick up a
dropped card and come up ready to strike
or with the tiling up your sleeve ready to
throw or you just dodge under the table
when theres some shooting coming you
wouldnt believe the damage a fellow with a
knife under the table can do to ill-conditioned
skunks that want to raise trouble before they
begin to understand what the screamings
about and make a bolt-those that can that
is

  the roses of schombergs cheeks at the
roots of his chestnut beard faded perceptibly
ricardo chuckled faintly

   there were one hundred and twenty-seven
sovereigns and some mexican dollars in that
skippers cash-box hardly enough to knock
a man on the head for from behind i must
confess but that the skipper had a narrow
escape the governor himself could not deny
afterward

     do you want me to understand sir that
you mind there being one life more or less on
this earth i asked him a few hours after
we got away

     certainly not says he


munseys magazine

    well then why did you stop me
theres a proper way of doing things
youll have to learn to be correct theres
also unnecessary exertion that must be
avoided too - if only for the look of the
thing a gentlemans way of putting things
to you-and no mistake

   at sunrise we got into a creek to lie hid-
den in case the treasure-hunting party had a
mind to take a spell hunting for us and
dash me if they didnt we saw the schooner
away out running to leeward with ten pairs
of binoculars sweeping the sea no doubt on
all sides i advised the governor to give her
time to beat back again before we made a
start so we stayed up that creek something
like ten days as snug as can be

   on the seventh day we had to kill a man
though-the brother of this pedro here they
were alligator-hunters right enough we got
our lodgings in their hut neither the boss
nor i could habla espahol - speak spanish
you know-much then dry bank nice shade
jolly hammocks fresh fish good game every-
thing lovely the governor chucked them a
few dollars to begin with but it was like
boarding with a pair of savage apes anyhow
by and by we noticed them talking a lot to-
gether they had twigged the cash-box and
the leather portmanteaus and my bag-a jolly
lot of plunder to look at they must have
been saying to each other

    no ones ever likely to come looking for
these two fellows who seem to have fallen
from the moon lets cut their throats
why of course clear as daylight i
didnt need to spy one of them sharpening a
develish long knife behind some bushes to
know what was in the wind pedro was
standing by trying the edge of another long
knife they thought we were away on our
lookout at the mouth of the river as was
usual with us during the day not that we
expected to see much of the schooner but it
was just as well to make certain if possible
and then it was cooler out of the woods in
the breeze well the governor was there
right enough lying comfortable on a rug
where he could watch the offing but i had
gone back to the hut to get a chew of to-
bacco out of my bag i had not broken my-
self of the habit then and i couldnt be happy
unless i had a lump as big as a babys fist in
my cheek

  at the cannibalistic comparison schomberg
muttered a faint ejaculation ricardo hitched
himself up in his seat and glanced down his
outstretched legs complacently

   i am tolerably light on my feet as a
general thing he went on  dash me if i
dont think i could drop a pinch of salt on
a sparrows tail if i tried anyhow they
didnt hear me i watched them two brown
hairy brutes not ten yards off that pedro
has a pelt like a bear all they had on was
white linen drawers rolled up on their thighs
antonio was down on his thick hams busy
rubbing the steel on a flat stone pedro was
leaning against a small tree and passing his
thumb along the edge of his blade i got
away quieter than a mouse you bet

   i didnt say anything to the boss then
he was leaning on his elbow on his rug and
didnt seem to want to be spoken to hes
like that-sometimes that familiar you might
think he would eat out of your hand and at
others he would snub you sharper than a
devil-but always quiet perfect gentleman
i tell you i didnt bother him then but i
wasnt likely to forget them two fellows so
businesslike with their knives at that time
we had only one revolver between us two-
the governors six-shooter but loaded only in
five chambers and we had no more cartridges
he had left the box behind in a drawer in his
cabin awkward i had nothing but an old
clasp-knife - no good at all for anything
serious

   in the evening we four sat round a bit
of fire outside the sleeping-shed eating broiled
fish off plantain leaves with roast yams for
bread-the usual thing the governor and i
were on one side and these two beauties
cross-legged on the other grunting a word or
two to each other now and then hardly hu-
man speech at all presently i began to talk
to the boss quietly just as i am talking to
you now careless like and i told him all i
had observed he goes on picking up pieces
of fish and putting them into his mouth as
calm as anything its a pleasure to have
anything to do with a gentleman never
looked across at them once

  and now says i yawning on purpose
 weve got to stand watch at night turn
about and keep our eyes skinned all day too
and mind we dont get jumped upon suddenly

     its perfectly intolerable says the gov-
ernor  and you with no weapon of any
sort

     i mean to slick pretty close to you sir
from this on if you dont mind says i

    he just nods the least bit wipes his fin-
gers on the plantain leaf puts his hand be-
hind his back as if to help himself to rise
from the ground snatches his revolver from
victory



under his jacket and plugs a bullet plumb
center into mr antonios chest see what it
is to have to do with a gentleman no con-
founded fuss and things done out of hand
but he might have tipped me a wink or some-
thing i nearly jumped out of my skin
scared aint in it i didnt even know who
had fired everything had been so still just
before that the bang of the shot seemed the
loudest noise i had ever heard the honor-
able antonio pitches forward-they always do
toward the shot you must have noticed that
yourself-yes he pitches forward onto the
embers and all that lot of hair on his face
and head flashes up like a pinch of gunpowder
greasy i expect always scraping the fat off
them alligators hides-

   look here exclaimed schomberg violent-
ly as if trying to burst some invisible bonds
 do you mean to say that all this hap-
pened

   no said ricardo coolly  i am making
it all up as i go along just to help you
through the hottest part of the afternoon so
down he pitches his nose on the red embers
and up jumps our handsome pedro and i at
the same time like two jacks-in-a-box he
starts to bolt away with his head over his
shoulder and i hardly knowing what i was
doing spring on his back i had the sense
to get my hands round his neck at once and
its about all i could do to lock my fingers
tight under his jaw you saw the beautys
neck didnt you hard as iron too down
we both went seeing this the governor puts
his revolver in his pocket

    tie his legs together sir i yell  im
trying to strangle him

   there was a lot of their fiber lines lying
about i gave him a last squeeze and then
got up

    i might have shot you says the gov-
ernor quite concerned

    but you are glad to have saved a car-
tridge sir i tell him

   my jump did save it it wouldnt have
done to let him get away in the dark like
that and have the beauty dodging round in
the bushes perhaps with the rusty flint-lock
gun they had the governor owned up that
the jump was the correct thing

    but he isnt dead says he bending over
him

   might as well hope to strangle an ox
we made haste to tie his elbows back and
then before he came to himself we dragged
him to a small tree sat him up and bound him
to it not by the waist but by the neck-some

  twenty turns of small line round his throat
and the trunk finished off with a reef-knot
under his ear the next thing we did was to
attend to the honorable antonio who was ma-
king a great smell frizzling his face on the
red coals we pushed and rolled him into the
creek and left the rest to the alligators

   i was tired that little scrap took it out
of me something awful the governor hadnt
turned a hair thats where a gentleman has
the pull of you he dont get excited no
gentleman does-or hardly ever i fell asleep
all of a sudden and left him smoking by the
fire i had made up his railway rug round his
legs as calm as if he were sitting in a first-
class carriage we hardly spoke ten words to
each other after it was over and from that
day to this we have never talked of the busi-
ness i wouldnt have known he remembered
it if he hadnt alluded to it when talking with
you the other day-you know with regard to
pedro

   it surprised you didnt it thats why i
am giving you this yarn of how he came to be
with us like a sort of dog-dashed sight more
useful though you know how he can trot
around with trays well he could bring
down an ox with his fist at a word from the
boss just as cleverly and fond of the gov-
ernor oh my word more than any dog
is of any man

  schomberg squared his chest

   oh and thats one of the things i wanted
to mention to mr jones he said  its un-
pleasant to have that fellow round the house
so early he sits on the stairs at the back
for hours before he is needed here and fright-
ens people so that the service suffers the
chinamen-

  ricardo nodded and raised his hand

   when i first saw him he was fit to fright-
en a grizzly bear let alone a chinaman hes
become civilized now to what he once was
well that morning first thing on opening my
eyes i saw him sitting there tied up by the
neck to the tree i didnt look his way all
the morning but the governor went over and
had a look at him we spent the rest of the
day watching the sea and we actually made
out the schooner working to windward which
showed that she had given us up good
the governor had another steady look at him
which the fellow couldnt dodge because he
couldnt drop his head or turn it away either
he just blinked

 all the next night he made no sound
when the sun rose again i took a squint his
way he wasnt blinking he was rolling his

eyes all white one minute and black the next
and his tongue was hanging out a yard be-
ing tied up short by the neck like this would
daunt the arch devil himself-in time-in
time mind i dont know but that even a
real gentleman would find it difficult to keep
a stiff lip to the end presently we went to
work getting our boat ready i was busying
myself setting up the mats when the gov-
ernor passes the remark

  i think he wants to say something

  i had heard a sort of croaking going on
for some time only i wouldnt take any no-
tice but then i got out of the boat and went
up to him with some water his eyes were
red-red and black and half out of his head
he drank all the water i gave him but he
hadnt much to say fox himself i walked
back to the governor

    he asks for a bullet in his head before
we go i said i wasnt at all pleased

    oh thats out of the question alto-
gether says the governor

   he was right there only four shots left
and ninety jniles of wild coast to put behind
us before coming to the first place where you
could expect to buy revolver cartridges

  anyhow i tells him he wants to be
killed some way or other as a favor

   and then i go on setting the boats mast
i didnt care much for the notion of butcher-
ing a man bound hand and foot and fastened
by the neck besides i had a knife then-the
honorable antonios knife and that knife is
this knife

  ricardo gave his leg a resounding slap

   first spoil in my new life he went on
with harsh joviality  the dodge of carrying
it down there i learned later i carried it
stuck in my belt that day no i hadnt much
stomach for the job but when you work with
a gentleman of the real right sort you may
depend on your feelings being seen through
your skin says the governor suddenly

    it may even be looked upon as his right 
-you hear a gentleman speaking there- but
what do you think of taking him with us in
the boat

   and the governor starts arguing that the
beggar would be useful in working our way
along the coast we could get rid of him
before coming to the first place that was a
little civilized it didnt want much talking
over out i scrambled from the boat

  aye but will he be manageable sir

    oh yes hes daunted go on cut him
loose-i take the responsibility

     right you are sir

   he sees me come along smartly with his
brothers knife in my hand-i wasnt thinking
how it looked from his side of the fence you
know-and jiminy it nearly killed him he
stared like a crazed bullock and began to
sweat and twitch all over something amazing
i was so surprised that i stopped dead short
to look at him the drops were pouring over
his eyebrows down his beard off his nose-
and he gurgled then it struck me that he
couldnt see what was in my mind he didnt
like to die when it came to it-not in that way
anyhow when i stepped round to get at the
lashing he let out a sort of soft bellow
thought i was going to stick him from be-
hind i guess i cut all the turns with one
slash and he went over on his side flop and
started kicking with his tied legs

   laugh i dont know what there was so
funny about it but i fairly shouted what
between my laughing and his wriggling i had
a job in cutting him free as soon as he could
feel his limbs he makes for the bank where
the governor was standing crawls up to him
on his hands and knees and embraces his legs
gratitude eh you could see that being
allowed to live suited that chap down to the
ground the governor gets his legs away from
him gently and just mutters to me

    lets be off get him into the boat

   it was not difficult continued ricardo
after eying schomberg fixedly for a moment
 he was ready enough to get into the boat
and here he is turned out useful and all
from gratitude there was never such grati-
tude he will watch and work and fight and
go without sleep food or drink he would
let himself be chopped into small pieces-with
a smile mind with a smile-for the gov-
ernor i dont know about him doing that
much for me but pretty near pretty near
i did the tying up and the untying but he
could see who was the boss and then he
knows a gentleman a dog knows a gentle-
man-any dog its only some foreigners that
dont know-and nothing can teach them
either

   and you mean to say asked schomberg
disregarding what might have been annoying
for himself in the emphasis of the final re-
mark  you mean to say that you left steady
employment at good wages for a life like
this

  there began ricardo quietly thats
just what a man like you would say i follow
a gentleman that aint the same thing as to
serve an employer they give you your paltry
wages as theyd fling a bone to a dog and
victory



they expect you to be grateful its worse
than slavery

  he mumbled some curses directed at em-
ployers generally as it seemed then blazed
out

   work be darned i aint a dog walking
on its hind legs for a bone i am a man whos
serving a gentleman theres a difference
which you will never understand mr tame
schomberg

  he yawned slightly schomberg preserv-
ing a military stiffness reenforced by a slight
frown had allowed his thoughts to stray away
they were limning the picture of a young girl
-absent-gone-stolen from him there was
that rascal looking at him insolently if the
girl had not been shamefully decoyed away
from him he would not have allowed any one
to look at him insolently he would have
made nothing of hitting that rogue between
the eyes he saw himself doing it and in
sympathy with this glorious vision his right
arm moved convulsively

  at this moment he came out of his sudden
reverie to note with alarm the wide-awake
curiosity of mr ricardos stare

   and so you go like this about the world
gambling he remarked inanely to cover his
confusion  isnt it very precarious

   no not so bad ricardo said  its my
opinion that men will gamble as long as they
have anything to put on a card gamble
thats nature whats life itself you never
know what may turn up the worst of it is
that you never erf tell exactly what sort of
cards you are holding yourself whats
trumps-that is the question see any man
will gamble if only hes given a chance for
anything or everything you too-

   i havent touched a card now for twenty
years said schomberg in an austere tone

   well if you got your living that way you
would be no worse than you are now selling
drinks to people-beastly beer and spirits-
rotten stuff fit to make an old he goat yell if
you poured it down its throat pooh i cant
stand the confounded liquor never could
a whiff of neat brandy in a glass makes me
feel sick always did ive tried to get over
it i used to see fellows roll about singing as
if the whole world belonged to them i would
hold my breath and try to do like the others
but no go never could get properly drunk
and next morning - oh my word taint
worth it if everybody was like me liquor
would be going a begging you think its
funny in a man dont you

  schomberg made a vague gesture of tolera-

tion ricardo hitched up in his chair and set-
tled his elbow afresh on the table

   french sirups i must say i do like
saigons the place for them i see you have
sirups in the bar hang me if i aint getting
dry conversing with you come mr schom-
berg be hospitable as the governor says

  schomberg rose and walked with dignity to
the counter he came back carrying a bottle
labeled  sirop de groseille  and a pink and
glistening tumbler mr ricardo had followed
his movements with oblique coyly expectant
yellow eyes like a cat watching the prepara-
tion of a saucer of milk and the satisfied
sound after he had drunk might have been a
slightly modified form of purring very soft
and deep in his throat

  meanwhile schomberg smoked with moody
composure facing him ricardo blinked
slowly for a time then closed his eyes alto-
gether with the placidity of the domestic cat
dozing on the hearth-rug in another moment
he opened them very wide and seemed sur-
prised to see schomberg there

   youre having a very slack time to-day
arent you he observed  but then this
whole town is confoundedly slack anyhow and
ive never faced such a slack party at a table
before come eleven oclock they begin to
talk of breaking up whats the matter with
them want to go to bed so early or what
 i reckon you dont lose a fortune by their
wanting to go to bed said schomberg with
somber sarcasm

   no admitted ricardo with a grin that
stretched his thin mouth from ear to ear
giving a sudden glimpse of his white teeth
 only you see when i once start i would
play for nuts for parched peas for any rub-
bish but these dutchmen arent any good
they never seem to get warmed up properly
win or lose ive tried them both ways too
hang them for a beggarly bloodless lot of
animated cucumbers

   and if anything out of the way was to
happen they would be just as cool in locking
up you and your gentleman schomberg
snarled unpleasantly

  indeed said ricardo slowly taking
schombergs measure with his eyes  and
what about you

   you talk mighty big burst out the hotel-
keeper  you talk of ranging all over the
world and doing great things and taking for-
tune by the scruff of the neck but here you
stick at this miserable business

   it isnt much of a lay-thats a fact ad-
mitted ricardo unexpectedly


munseys magazine

  schomberg was red in the face with
audacity

    i call it paltry he spluttered

  thats how it looks cant call it any-
thing else ricardo seemed to be in an ac-
commodating mood  but if you knew the
whole circumstances you wouldnt get your-
self in a state with me he continued easily
then with something of a confidential man-
ner  i should be ashamed of it myself only
you see the governor is subject to these fits-
fits schomberg cried out but in a low
tone you dont say so fits thats a
serious thing isnt it you ought to take him
to the civil hospital-a lovely place

  ricardo nodded slightly with a faint grin

   serious enough regular fits of laziness i
call them now and then he lays down on me
like this and theres no moving him if you
think i like it youre a long way out i dont
i would rather have any crazy notion sprung
on me as has happened more than once gen-
erally speaking i can talk him over i know
how to deal with a gentleman i am no daily-
bread slave but when he has said  martin
i am bored then look out theres nothing
to do but to shut up-confound it

  schomberg had listened open-mouthed

   whats the cause of it he asked  why
is he like this i dont understand

   i think i do said ricardo  a gentle-
man you know is not such a simple person as
you or i and not so easy to manage either
if i only had something to lever him out

with

  he rose noiselessly stretched himself sup-
ple and stealthy glanced out of the corners of
his eyes in the direction of the door and
finally leaned back against the table folding
his arms on his breast comfortably in a com-
pletely human attitude

   thats another thing you can tell a gentle-
man by-his freakishness a gentleman aint
accountable to nobody any more than a tramp
on the roads he aint got to keep time the
governor got like this once in a one-horse
mexican pueblo on the uplands away from
everywhere he lay all day long in a dark
room-

  drunk

   no that never comes on together with
this kind of fit he just lay there full length
on a mat while a ragged bare-legged boy that
he had picked up in the street sat in the
patio near the open door of his room strum-
ming on a guitar and singing tristes to him
from morning to night youknow tristes-
twang twang twang aouh hoo chroo yah

  schomberg raised his hands in distress
this tribute seemed to flatter ricardo his
mouth twitched grimly

   like that-enough to give colic to an
ostrich eh well there was a cook there who
loved me-an old fat negro woman with
spectacles i used to hide in the kitchen and
bribe her to make me dulces-sweet things
you know mostly eggs and sugar-to pass the
time away i am like a kid for sweet things
and by the way why dont you ever have a
pudding at your tablydott mr schomberg
nothing but fruit morning noon and night
sickening what do you think a fellow is-
a wasp

  schomberg disregarded the injured tone

   and how long did that fit as you call it
last he asked

   weeks months years centuries it seemed
to me returned mr ricardo with feeling
 of an evening the governor would stroll out
into the scda and fritter his life away playing
cards with the juez of the place-a little dago
with a pair of black whiskers-ekarty you
know a quick french game for small change
and the comandante a one-eyed half-indian
flat-nosed ruffian and i we had to stand
around and bet on their hands it was awful

  awful echoed schomberg in a throaty
tone of despair  look here i want your
rooms

  to be sure i have been thinking that
for some time said ricardo indifferently

   i was mad when i listened to you this
must end

   i think you are mad yet said ricardo
not even unfolding his arms or shifting his
attitude an inch  and if i thought you had
been to the police i would tell pedro to catch
you round the waist and break your fat neck
by jerking your head backward-snap i saw
him do it to a big buck nigger who was flour-
ishing a razor in front of the governor you
hear a low crack thatsall-and the man
drops down like a limp rag

xv

  schomberg felt desperation that lamenta-
ble substitute for courage ooze out of him
it was not so much the threat of death as the
weirdly circumstantial manner of its declara-
tion which affected him a mere  ill murder
you  however ferocious in tone and earnest in
purpose he could have faced but before this
novel mode of speech and procedure his im-
agination being very sensitive to the unusual
he collapsed as if indeed his moral neck had
been broken-snap
victory



  lgo to the police of course not never
dreamed of it too late now ive let my-
self be mixed up in this you got my consent
while i wasnt myself i explained it to you at
the time

  ricardos eyes glided gently off schomberg
to stare far away

  aye some trouble with a girl but
thats nothing to us

   naturally what i say is whats the good
of all that savage talk to me a bright argu-
ment occurred to him  its out of propor-
tion for even if i were fool enough to go to
the police now theres nothing serious to com-
plain about it would only mean deportation
for you they would put you on board the
first west-bound steamer to singapore
ricardo made no comment and gave no
sign of having heard a single word this dis-
couraged schomberg who had looked up hope-
fully

   why do you want to stick here he cried
 it cant pay you people to fool around like
this didnt you worry just now about mov-
ing your governor well the police would
move him for you and from singapore you
can go on to the east coast of africa

    ill be hanged if the fellow isnt up to that
silly trick was ricardos comment spoken
in an ominous tone which recalled schomberg
to the realities of his position

  no no he protested of course i
wouldnt

   i do think that trouble about the girl has
muddled your brains mr schomberg believe
me you had better part friends with us-for
youll be paid off for any nasty dodge you may
be hatching in that fat head of yours de-
portation or no deportation one of us would
be back before long to pay you off

   gott im himmell  groaned schomberg
 will nothing move him out suppose i were
to make it worth your while couldnt you-
 no ricardo interrupted  i couldnt un-
less i had something to lever him out with
ive told you that before

   an inducement muttered schomberg

   aye the east coast of africa isnt good
enough he told me the other day that it will
have to wait till he is ready for it and he may
not be ready for a long time because the east
coast cant run away and no one is likely to
run off with it

  these remarks whether considered as tru-
isms or as depicting mr joness mental state
were distinctly discouraging to the long-suf-
fering schomberg but there is truth in the
well-known saying that places the darkest

hour before the dawn the sound of words
apart from the context has its power and
these two words  run off had a special
affinity to the hotel-keepers haunting idea it
was always present in his brain and now it
came forward evoked by a purely fortuitous
expression no nobody could run off with a
continent but heyst had run off with the girl

  ricardo could have had no conception of
the cause of schombergs changed expression
a sort of sinister dawn had broken upon the
hotel-keepers perplexity

   i could put you on another track he said
slowly and stopped as if suddenly choked by
an unholy emotion of intense eagerness com-
bined with fear of failure ricardo waited at-
tentive yet not without a certain contempt

  on the track of a man schomberg ut-
tered convulsively and paused again consult-
ing his rage and his conscience

   the man in the moon eh suggested
ricardo in a jeering murmur

  schomberg shook his head

   it would be nearly as safe to rook him as
if he were the man in the moon you go and
try it isnt so very far

  he reflected these men were thieves and
murderers as well as gamblers their fitness
for purposes of vengeance was appallingly
complete he put it to himself that he would
be paying heyst out and would at the same
time relieve himself of these mens oppres-
sion

  he had the first consoling moment for
many many days to feel himself so clever
somewhat restored his self-respect it re-
mained now to show himself persuasive

  he raised his eyes and found that he had
self-confidence enough to face ricardos faint-
ly mocking scrutiny letting loose his natural
gift for talking scandalously about his fellov-
creatures he poured forth his story port rav-
ing a heyst fattened by years of private and
public rapines the murderer of morrison the
swindler of many shareholders a wonderful
mixture of craft and impudence of deep pur-
poses and simple wiles of mystery and
futility

   he hung about this part of the world for
years spying into everybodys business but i
am the only one who has seen through him
from the first-contemptible double-faced
stick-at-nothing dangerous fellow

   dangerous is he

  schomberg came to himself at the sound of
ricardos voice

   well you know what i mean he said
uneasily  a lying circumventing soft-




	munseys magazine

spoken polite stuck-up rascal nothing open
about him

  mr ricardo had slipped off the table and
was prowling about the room in an oblique
noiseless manner

   and you say he has been living alone
there

   like the man in the moon answered
schomberg readily  theres no one that
cares a rap what becomes of him he has
been lying low you understand after bagging
all that plunder

   plunder eh why didnt he go home with
it inquired ricardo

  mr joness henchman was beginning to
think that this was something worth looking
into

   go home schomberg retorted fearlessly
 why dont you go home to hear your talk
you must have made a pretty considerable pile
going round winning peoples money you
ought to be ready by this time

  ricardo stopped to look at schomberg with
surprise	

   you think yourself very clever dont
you he said

  schomberg just then was so conscious of
being clever that the snarling irony left him
unmoved he was in a felicitous vein

   how do you know that he wasnt thinking
of going home as a matter of fact he was
on his way home

   and how do i know that you are not
amusing yourself by spinning out a blamed
fairy tale interrupted ricardo roughly  i
wonder at myself listening to the silly rot
schomberg received this turn of temper un-
moved he did not require to be very subtly
observant to notice that he had managed to
arouse some sort of feeling perhaps of greed
in ricardos breast

  you wont believe me well you can
ask anybody that comes here if that-that
swede hadnt got as far as this house on his
way home why should he turn up here if
not for that you ask anybody

   ask indeed returned the other  catch
me asking at large about a man i mean to drop
on such jobs must be done on the quiet-
or not at all

  the peculiar intonation of the last phrase
touched the nape of schombergs necjc with a
chill but it did not stop his eloquence

   havent i got eyes he went on
 havent i got my common sense to tell me
by the same token he called on the tesmans
why did he call on the tesmans two days
running eh you cant tell

  he waited complacently till ricardo had
finished swearing at him for a confounded
chatterer and then went on

   a fellow doesnt go to a counting-house in
business hours foi a chat about the weather
two days running then why to close his
account with them one day and to get his
money out the next clear what

  ricardo with his trick of looking one way
and moving another approached schomberg
slowly

   to get his money he purred

   geiviss snapped schomberg with impa-
tient superiority  what else that is only
the money he had with the tesmans what
he has buried or put away in some other way
on the island the deuce only knows when
you think of the lot of hard cash that passed
through that mans hands for wages and
stores and all that-and hes just a cunning
thief i tell you ricardos hard stare dis-
composed the hotel-keeper and he added in
an embarrassed tone i mean a common
sneaking thief-no account at all and he
calls himself a swedish baron too tfui

   hes a baron is he that foreign no-
bility aint much commented mr ricardo
seriously  and then what he hung about
here

   yes he hung about said schomberg ma-
king a wry mouth  he-hung about thats
it hung-

  his voice died out curiosity was depicted
in ricardos countenance

   and then turned about and went back to
that island again

  and went back to that island again
schomberg echoed lifelessly fixing his gaze on
the floor

  whats the matter with you asked
ricardo with genuine surprise  what is it
schomberg without looking up made an
impatient gesture his face was crimson and
he kept it lowered ricardo went back to the
point

   well but how do you account for it
what was his reason what did he go back
to the island for

  honeymoon spat out schomberg vi-
ciously

  perfectly still his eyes downcast he sud-
denly hit the table with his fist a blow which
caused the utterly unprepared ricardo to start
violently the hotel-keepers soul was raging
within him so that he couldnt trust himself to
speak further the gaze he raised to ricardos
face was wild and pained rendering faithfully
the discomfort of the inner man

   aye aye said the secretary  i wish i
hadnt asked you or that you had told me a
lie it dont suit me to know that theres a
woman mixed up in this affair whats she
like its the girl you-

   dont muttered schomberg

  aye aye ricardo repeated more and
more enlightened and perplexed  cant bear
to talk about it-so bad as that and yet i
would bet she isnt a miracle to look- at
schomberg made a gesture as if he didnt
know as if he didnt care then he squared
his shoulders and frowned at vacancy

  swedish baron-h-m ricardo continued
meditatively  i believe the governor would
think that business worth looking up quite if

i	put it to him properly the governor likes
a duel if you will call it so but i dont know
a man that can stand up to him on the square
have you ever seen a cat play writh a mouse
its a pretty sight

  ricardo with his voluptuously gleaming
eyes looked so much like a cat that schom-
berg would have felt all the alarm of a mouse
if other feelings had not had complete pos-
session of his breast

   there are no lies between you and me
he said more steadily than he thought he
could speak

   whats the good now he funks women
in that mexican pueblo where we lay ground-
ed on our beef-bones so to speak i used to
go to dances of an evening the girls there
would ask me if the english caballero in the
posada was a monk in disguise or if he had
taken a vow to the santissima viadre not to
speak to a wroman or whether- you can
imagine what fairly free-spoken girls will ask
when they come to the point of not caring
what they say and it used to vex me yes
the governor funks facing women

  one woman interjected schomberg in
guttural tones

   one may be more awkward to deal with
than two or two hundred for that matter
in a place thats full of women you neednt
look at them unless you like but if you go
into a room where there is only one woman
young or old pretty or ugly you have got to
face her and unless you are after her then
-the governor is right enough-shes in the
way

  why notice them muttered schomberg
 what can they do

   make a noise if nothing else opined mr
ricardo curtly with the distaste of a man
whose path is a path of silence for indeed
nothing is more odious than a noise when one

is engaged in a weighty and absorbing card
game  noise noise my friend he went on
forcibly confounded screeching about some-
thing or other and i like it no more than the
governor does but with the governor theres
something more besides-a good deal more
he cant stand them at all im hanged if i
dont think they are to him what liquor is to
me brandy-pah

  he made a disgusted face and produced a
genuine shudder schomberg listened to him
in wonder it looked as if the very scoundrel-
ism of that-that swede would protect him
the spoil of his iniquity standing between the
thief and the retribution

   thats so old buck ricardo broke the
silence after contemplating schombergs mute
dejection with a sort of sympathy  i dont
think this trick will work no i dont think
i care to put it before him sick as i am of
staying here

  ricardo could not be more sick of staying
than schomberg was of seeing him stay

   it would have been like going to pick up
a nugget of a thousand pounds or two or
three times as much for all i know no
trouble no-

  	the petticoats the trouble ricardo
struck in

  he had resumed his noiseless feline oblique
prowling in which an observer would have
detected a new character of excitement such
as a wild animal of the cat species anxious to
make a spring might betray schomberg saw
nothing it would probably have cheered his
drooping spirits but in a general way he pre-
ferred not to look at ricardo ricardo how-
ever with one of his slanting gliding restless
glances observed the bitter smile on schom-
bergs bearded lips-the unmistakable smile of
ruined hopes

   you are a pretty unforgiving sort of
chap he said stopping for a moment with
an air of interest  hang me if i ever saw
anybody look so disappointed i bet you
would send black plague to that island if you
only knew how-eh what plague too good
for them ha ha ha

   i dont wish any harm to the girl mut-
tered schomberg

   but she did bolt from you a fair bilk
come

   the deuce only knows what that villain-
ous swede had done to her-what he promised
her how he frightened her she couldnt have
cared for him i know schombergs vanity
clung to the belief in some atrocious ex-
traordinary means of seduction employed by




munseys magazine

heyst  look how he bewitched that poor
morrison he murmured

   ah morrison-got all his money-what
   yes-and his life

   terrible fellow that swedish baron how
is one to get at him

  schomberg exploded

   three against one are you shy do you
want me to give you a letter of introduction
 one would think the fellow lived next
door ricardo growled impatiently  hang
it all cant you understand a plain question
i have asked you the way

   the way is over the water of course
said the hotel-keeper  for people like you
three days in a good big boat is nothing its
no more than a little outing a bit of a change
at this season the java sea is a pond i have
an excellent safe boat-a ships life-boat-
carry thirty let alone three and a child could
handle her you might call it a pleasure-trip
 and yet having this fine boat you didnt
go after her yourself-or after him well
you are a fine fellow for a disappointed lover
schomberg gave a start at the suggestion

   i am not three men he said sulkily as
the shortest answer of the several he could
have given

   oh i know your sort ricardo let fall
negligently  you are like most people-or
perhaps just a little more peaceable than the
rest of the buying and selling gang that bosses
this rotten show well well you respectable
citizen he went on  let us go thoroughly
into the matter

  when schomberg had been made to under-
stand that mr joness henchman was ready to
discuss in his own words  this boat of yours
with courses and distances and such concrete
matters of no good augury to that villainous
swede he recovered his soldierly bearing
squared his shoulders and asked in his military
manner

   you wish then to proceed with the busi-
ness

  ricardo nodded he had a great mind to
he said a gentleman had to be humored as
much as possible but he must be managed
too on occasions for his own good and it
was the business of the right sort of  fol-
lower  to know the proper time and the prop-
er methods of that delicate part of his duty

   ive never actually lied to him said
ricardo  and i aint going to now i shall
just say nothing about the girl he will have
to get over the shock the best he can too
much humoring wont do here

   funny thing schomberg observed crisply

  is it aye you wouldnt mind taking a
woman by the throat in some dark corner and
nobody by i bet

   and you schomberg defended himself
 dont you want me to believe you are up to
anything

   i my boy oh yes i am not that gen-
tleman neither are you take em by the
throat or chuck em under the chin is all one
to me-almost affirmed ricardo with some-
thing obscurely ironical in his complacency
 now as to this business a three days jaunt
in a good boat isnt a thing to frighten people
like us you are right so far but there are
other details

  schomberg was ready enough to enter into
details he explained that he had a small
plantation with a fairly habitable hut on it
on madura he proposed that his guests
should start from town in his boat as if going
for an excursion to that rural spot the cus-
tom-house people on the quay were used to
see his boat go off on such trips

  from madura after some repose and on a
convenient day mr jones and party would
make the real start it would all be plain
sailing schomberg undertook to provision
the boat the greatest hardship the voyagers
need apprehend would be perhaps a mild
shower of rain at that season of the year
there were no serious thunder-storms

  under his lieutenant-of-the-reserve exterior
schombergs heart began to thump as he saw
himself nearing his vengeance his speech was
thick but persuasive

  no risk at all-none whatever

  ricardo dismissed these assurances of safety
with an impatient gesture he was thinking
of other risks

  the getting away from here is all right
but we may be sighted at sea and that may
bring awkwardness later on a ships boat
with three white men in her knocking about
out of sight of land is bound to make talk
are we likely to be seen on our way

   only by native craft said schomberg
ricardo nodded satisfied native craft did
not count of course

  it was an empty solitary part of the sea
schomberg expounded further only the ter-
nate mail-boat crossed that region about the
th of every month regularly - nowhere
near the island though rigid his voice
hoarse his heart thumping his mind concen-
trated on the success of his plan the hotel-
keeper multiplied words as if to keep as many
of them as possible between himself and the
murderous aspect of his purpose
victory



   so if you gentlemen depart from my
plantation quietly at sunset on the th-al-
ways best to make a start at night with a
land breeze-its a hundred to one-what am

i	saying its a thousand to one that no
human eye will see you on the passage all
youve got to do is to keep her heading north-
east for say fifty hours-perhaps not quite
so long there will always be draft enough
to keep a boat moving you may reckon on
that and then-

  ricardo regarded him steadily with those
dry eyes of his shining more like polished
stones than living tissue

  and then what he asked

   and then-why you will astonish der herr
baron-ha ha

  schomberg seemed to force the words and
the laugh out of himself in a hoarse bass

   and you believe he has all that plunder
by him asked ricardo rather perfunctorily
because the fact seemed to him extremely
probable when looked at all round by his acute
mind

  schomberg raised his hands and lowered
them slowly

   how can it be otherwise he was going
home he was on his way in this hotel ask
people was it likely he would leave it be-
hind him

  ricardo was thoughtful then suddenly
raising his head he remarked

   steer northeast for fifty hours eh thats
not much of a sailing direction ive heard of
a port being missed before on better informa-
tion cant you say what sort of landfall a
fellow may expect but i suppose you have
never seen that island yourself

  schomberg admitted that he had not seen
it in a tone in which a man congratulates him-
self on having escaped the contamination of
an unsavory experience no certainly not
he had never had any business to call him
there but what of that he could give mr
ricardo as good a sea-mark as anybody need
wish for he laughed nervously miss it he
defied any one that came within forty miles
of it to miss the retreat of that villainous
swede

   what do you think of a pillar of smoke
by day and a loom of fire at night theres
a volcano in full blast near fhat island-
enough to guide almost a blind man what
more do you want an active volcano to
steer by

  these last words he roared out exultingly
then jumped up and glared the door to the
left of the bar had swung open and mrs

schomberg dressed for duty stood facing him
down the whole length of the room she clung
to the handle for a moment then came in and
glided to her place where she sat down to
stare straight before her as usual

  tropical nature had been kind to the fail-
ure of the commercial enterprise the desola-
tion of the headquarters of the tropical belt
coal company had been screened from the
side of the sea from the side where prying
eyes-if any were sufficiently interested either
in malice or in sorrow-could have noted the
decaying bones of that once sanguine enter-
prise

  heyst had been sitting among the bones
buried so kindly in the grass of two wet sea-
sons growth the silence of his surroundings
broken only by such sounds as a distant roll
of thunder the lash of rain through the foliage
of some big trees the noise of the wind toss-
ing the leaves of the forest and of the short
seas breaking against the shore favored rather
than hindered his solitary meditation

  a meditation is always-in a white man at
least-more or less an interrogative exercise
heyst meditated in simple terms on the mys-
tery of his actions and he answered himself
with the honest reflection

   there must be a lot of the original adam
in me after all

  he reflected too with the sense of making
a discovery that this primeval ancestor is not
easily suppressed the oldest voice in the
world is just the one that never ceases to
speak if anybody could have silenced its im-
perative echoes it should have been heysts
father with his contemptuous inflexible nega-
tion of all effort but apparently he could not
there was in the son a lot of that first an-
cestor who as soon as he could uplift his
muddy frame from the celestial mold started
inspecting and naming the animals of that
paradise which he was so soon to lose

  action-the first thought or perhaps the
first impulse on earth the barbed hook
baited with the illusion of progress to bring
out of the lightless void the shoals of unnum-
bered generations

  	and i the son of my father have been
caught too like the silliest fish of them all
heyst said to himself

  he suffered he was hurt by the sight of
his own life which ought to have been a mas-
terpiece of aloofness he remembered always
his last evening with his father he remem-
bered the thin features the great mass of


muxseys magazine

white hair and the ivory complexion a five-
branched candlestick stood on a little table by
the side of the easy chair they had been
talking a long time the noises of the street
had died out one by one till at last in the
moonlight the london houses began to look-
like the tombs of an unvisited unhonored
cemetery of hopes

  he had listened then after a silence he
had asked-for he was really young then

    is there no guidance

  his father was in an unexpectedly soft
mood on that night when the moon swam in
a cloudless sky over the begrimed shadows of
the town

	you still believe in something then he
said in a clear voice which had been growing
feeble of late you believe in flesh and
blood perhaps a full and equable contempt
would soon do away with that too but since
you have not attained to it i advise you to
cultivate that form of contempt which is called
pity it is perhaps the least difficult-always
remembering that you too if you are any-
thing are as pitiful as the rest yet never ex-
pecting any pity for yourself

    w hat is one to do then sighed the young
man regarding his father rigid in the high-
backed chair

   look on-make no sound were the last
words of the man who had spent his life in
blowing blasts upon a terrible trumpet which
had filled heaven and earth with ruins while
mankind went on its way unheeding

   that very night he died in his bed so quiet-
ly that they found him in his usual attitude of
sleep lying on his side one hand under his
cheek and his knees slightly bent he had
not even straightened his legs

  his son buried the silenced destroyer of
systems of hopes of beliefs he observed
that the death of that bitter contemner of life
did not trouble the flow of lifes stream where
men and women go by thick as dust revolving
and jostling one another like figures cut out of
cork and weighted with lead just sufficiently
to keep them in their proudly upright posture

  after the funeral heyst sat alone in the
dusk and his meditation took the form of a
definite vision of the stream of the fatuously
jostling nodding spinning figures hurried ir-
resistibly along and giving no sign of being
aware that the voice on the bank had been
suddenly silenced

  a few slow tears rolled down his face the
rooms filling with shadows seemed haunted
bv a melancholy uneasy presence which could 
not express itself the young man got up

with a strange sense of making way for some-
thing impalpable that claimed possession went
out of the house and locked the door a fort-
night later he started on his travels-to  look
on and never make a sound

   the humbler denizens of the world with
whom he preferred to associate called him
kindly  a queer mooning chap his faintly
playful politeness had puzzled and amused ail
sorts and conditions of men in brazil in trip-
oli in all the other stations of his erratic
progress toward the islands where he had re-
mained enchanted going round and round like
a bit of straw in the eddy of a mill-race but
it did not offend either the simple or the
gentle still they could not guess that below
the playfully polite surface he had for gentle
and simple for men and women for all the
opportunities and dangers of the world and
for his own fate in it that form of contempt
which is called pity for he followed the
advice of his pitiless father-given perhaps
in a moment of secret weakness or perhaps
simply from the malice of age provoked by
the innocence of youth

   the elder heyst had left behind him a little
 money and a certain quantity of movable ob-
 jects such as books tables chairs and pic-
 tures which might have complained of heart-
 less desertion after many years of faithful
 service for there is a soul in things heyst
 our heyst had often thought of them re-
 proachful and mute shrouded and locked up
 in those rooms far away in london he
 would never have them sold or even mo-ed
 from the places they occupied when he looked
 upon them last when he was advised from
 london that his lease had expired and that
 the house with some others as like it as
 peas was to be demolished he was surprising-
 ly distressed

   he had entered by then the broad human
path of inconsistencies already the tropical
belt coal company was in existence he sent
instructions to have some of the things sent
out to him at samburan just as any ordinary
credulous person would have done they
came torn out from their long repose-a lot
of books some chairs and tables his fathers
portrait in oils which surprised heyst by its
air of youth because he remembered his
father as a much older man a lot of small
objects such as candlesticks inkstands and
statuettes from his fathers study which sur-
prised him because they looked so old and so
much worn

the shade besieged by a fierce sunshine must
have felt like a remorseful apostate before
these relics he handled them tenderly and
it was perhaps their presence there which at-
tached him to the island when he woke up to
the failure of his apostasy

  whatever the decisive reason heyst had
remained where another would have been glad
to be off the excellent davidson had dis-
covered the fact without discovering the
reason and took a humane interest in heysts
strange existence while at the same time his
native delicacy kept him from intruding on
the others whim of solitude he could not
possibly guess that heyst alone on the island
felt neither more nor less lonely than in any
other place desert or populous

  davidsons concern was if one may express
it so the danger of spiritual starvation but
this was a spirit which had renounced all out-
side nourishment and was sustaining itself
proudly on its own contempt of the usual
coarse aliments which life offers to the com-
mon appetites of men

  neither was heysts body in danger of
starvation as schomberg had so confidently
asserted at the beginning of the companys
operations the island had been provisioned in
a manner which had outlasted the need heyst
did not need to fear hunger and his very
loneliness had not been without some allevia-
tion of the crowd of imported chinese
laborers one at least had remained in sam-
buran solitary and strange like a swallow left
behind at the migrating season of his flock

  wang was not a common coolie he had
been a servant to white men before the
agreement between him and heyst consisted
in the exchange of a few words on the day
when the last batch of the mine coolies was
leaving samburan heyst leaning over the
balustrade of the veranda wras looking on as
calm in appearance as if he had never de-
parted from the doctrine that this world for
the wise is nothing but an amusing spectacle

  wang came round the house and standing
below raised up his yellow thin face

  all finish he asked

  heyst nodded slightly from above glancing
toward the jetty a crowd of blue-clad figures
was being hustled down into the boats of the
chartered steamer lying w-ell out like a paint-
ed ship on a painted sea painted in crude
colors without shadows without feeling with
brutal precision

   you had better hurry up if you dont want
to be left behind

  but the chinaman did not move

    me stop he declared

   heyst looked down at him for the first time

    you want to stop here

    yes

   what were you what was your work
here

    mess-loom boy

    do you want to stay with me here as my
boy inquired heyst surprised

  the chinaman unexpectedly put on a dep-
recatory expression and said after a marked
pause

    can do

  ou neednt said heyst unless you
like i propose to stay on here-it may be
for a very long time i have no power to
make you go if you wish to remain but i
dont see why you should

    got one piecee wife remarked wang un-
emotionally and marched eff turning his back
on the wharf and the great world beyond
represented by the steamer waiting for her
boats

   heyst learned presently that wang had per-
suaded one of the women of the alfuro village
on the west shore of the island beyond the
central ridge into coming over to live with
him in a remote part of the companys clear-
ing it was a curious case

   the alfuros having been frightened by the
sudden invasion of chinamen had blocked
the path over the ridge by felling a few trees
and had kept strictly on their own side the
coolies as a body mistrusting the manifest
mildness of these harmless fisherfolk had
kept to their lines without attempting to
cross the island wang was the brilliant ex-
ception he must have been uncommonly
fascinating in a way that was not apparent
to heyst or else uncommonly persuasive

   the womans services to heyst were limited
to the fact that she had anchored wang to
the spot by her charms which remained un-
known to the white man because she never
came near the houses the couple lived at
the edge of the forest and she could some-
times be seen gazing toward the bungalow
shading her eyes with her hand even from
a distance she appeared to be a shy wild
creature and heyst anxious not to try her
primitive nerves unduly scrupulously avoided
that side of the clearing in his strolls

  the day-or rather the first night-after
his hermit life began he was aware of vague
sounds of revelry in that direction em-
boldened by the departure of the invading
strangers some alfuros the womans friends
and relations had ventured over the ridge to


munseys magazine

attend something in the nature of a wedding-
feast wang had invited them

  but this was the only occasion when any
sound louder than the buzzing of insects had
troubled the profound silence of the clearing
the natives were never invited again wang
not only knew how to live according to con-
ventional proprieties but had strong personal
views as to the manner of arranging his do-
mestic existence

  after a time heyst perceived that wang
had annexed all the keys any key left lying
about vanished after wang had passed that
way subsequently some of them-those that
did not belong to the storerooms and the
empty bungalows and could not be regarded
as the common property of this community of
two-were returned to heyst tied in a bunch
with a piece of string he found them one
morning lying by the side of his plate he
had not been inconvenienced by their absence
because he never locked up anything in the
way of drawers and boxes

   heyst said nothing wang also said noth-
ing perhaps he had always been a taciturn
man perhaps he was influenced by the genius
of the locality which was certainly that of
silence till heyst and morrison had landed
in black diamond bay and named it that side
of samburan had hardly ever heard the sound
of human speech it was easy to be taciturn
with heyst who had plunged himself into an
abyss of meditation over books and remained
in it till the shadow of wang falling across
the page and the sound of a rough low voice
uttering the malay word  makan would
force him to climb out to a meal

   it is to be presumed that if wang suffered
constraint he made up for it with the alfuro
woman he always went back to her at the
first fall of dusk vanishing from the bunga-
low suddenly at his hour like a sort of topsy-
turvy day-hunting chinese ghost with a white
jacket and a pigtail

   presently giving way to a chinamans ruling
passion he could be observed breaking the
ground near his hut between the mighty
stumps of felled trees with a miners pickax
after a time he discovered a rusty but serv-
iceable spade in one of the empty storerooms
and it is to be supposed that he got on famous-
ly but nothing of it could be seen because
he went to the trouble of pulling to pieces one
of the companys sheds in order to get ma-
terials for making a high and very close fence
round his patch as if the growing of vege-
tables were an awful and holy mystery en-
trusted to the keeping of his race

  heyst following from a distance the progress
of wangs gardening-there was nothing else
to look at-was amused at the thought that he
in his own person represented the market for
its produce the chinaman had found several
packets of seeds in the storerooms and had
surrendered to an irresistible impulse to put
them in the ground he would make his mas-
ter pay for the vegetables that he was raising
to satisfy his instinct

  and looking silently at the silent wang go-
ing about his work in the bungalow in his
unhasty steady way heyst envied the china-
mans obedience to his instincts the powerful
simplicity of purpose which made his exist-
ence appear almost automatic in the mysteri-
ous precision of its facts

xvii

  during his masters absence at sourabaya
wang had busied himself with the ground im-
mediately in front of the principal bungalow
emerging from the fringe of grass growing
across the shore end of the coal-jetty heyst
beheld a broad clear space black and level
with one or two clumps of charred twigs
where the flame had swept from the front of
his house to the nearest trees of the forest

   you took the risk of firing the grass
heyst asked

  wang nodded hanging on the arm of the
white man before whom he stood was the girl
called alma but neither from the chinamans
eyes nor frtmi his expression could any one
have guessed that he was in the slightest de-
gree aware of the fact

   he has been tidying the place in this
labor-saving way explained heyst without
looking at the girl whose hand rested on his
forearm  hes the whole establishment you
see i told you i hadnt even a dog to keep
me company here

wang had marched off toward the wharf

   hes like those waiters in that place she
said  that place  was schombergs hotel at
sourabaya

   one chinaman looks very much like an-
other heyst remarked we shall find it
useful to have him here this is the house

  they faced at some distance the six
shallow steps leading up to the veranda the
girl had abandoned heysts arm

   this is the house he repeated

  she did not offer to budge away from his
side but stood staring fixedly at the steps as
if they had been something unique and im-
practicable he waited a little but she did
not move
victory



    dont you want to go in he asked with-
out turning his head to look at her the
suns too heavy to stand about here he
tried to overcome a sort of fear a sort of im-
patient faintness and his voice sounded
rough  you had better go in he concluded

  they both moved then but at the foot of
the stairs heyst stopped while the girl went
on rapidly as if nothing could stop her now
she crossed the veranda swiftly and entered
the twilight of the big central room opening
upon it and then the deeper twilight of the
room beyond she stood still in the dusk in
which her dazzled eyes could scarcely make
out the forms of objects and sighed a sigh of
relief the impression of sunlight of sea
and sky remained with her like a memory of
a painful trial gone through-done with at
last

  meanwhile heyst had walked back slowly
toward the jetty but he did not get so far
as that

  the practical and automatic wang had got
hold of one of the little trucks that had been
used for running baskets of coal alongside
ships he appeared pushing it before him
loaded lightly with heysts bag and the
bundle of the girls belongings wrapped in
mrs schombergs shawl heyst turned about
and walked by the side of the rusty rails on
which the truck ran opposite the house
wang stopped lifted the bag to his shoulder
balanced it carefully and then took the bundle
in his hand

    leave those things on the table in the big
room-understand 

   me savee grunted wang moving off

  heyst watched the chinaman disappear
from the veranda it was not till he had seen
wang come out that he himself entered the
twilight of the big room by that time wang
was out of sight at the back of the house
but by no means out of hearing

  the chinaman could hear the voice of him
who when there were many people there was
generally referred to as  number one
wang was not able to understand the words
but the tone interested him

   where are you cried number one

  then wang heard much more faint a voice
he had never heard before-a novel impres-
sion which he acknowledged by cocking his
head slightly to one side

   i am here-out of the sun

  the new voice sounded remote and uncer-
tain wang heard nothing more though he
waited for some time very still the top of
his shaven poll exactly level with the floor of

the back veranda his face meanwhile pre-
served an inscrutable immobility

   suddenly he stooped to pick up the lid of a
deal candle-box which was lying on the ground
by his foot breaking it up with his fingers
he directed his steps toward the cook-shed
where squatting on his heels he proceeded to
kindle a small fire under a very sooty kettle
possibly to make a cup of tea

  wang had some knowledge of the more
superficial rites and ceremonies of white mens
existence otherwise so enigmatically remote
to his mind and containing unexpected possi-
bilities of good and evil which had to be
watched for with prudence and care

xviii

  that morning as on all the others of the
full tale of thirty mornings since his return
with the girl to samburan heyst came out on
the veranda and spread his elbows on the
railing in an easy attitude of proprietorship

   the bulk of the central ridge of the island
cut off the bungalow from sunrises whether
glorious or cloudy angry or serene the
dwellers therein were debarred from reading
early the fortune of the new-born day it
sprang upon them in its fulness with a swift
retreat of the great shadow when the sun
clearing the ridge looked dow-n hot and dry
with a devouring glare like the eye of an
enemy but heyst once the number one of
this locality while it was comparatively teem-
ing with mankind appreciated the prolonga-
tion of early coolness the subdued lingering
half light the faint ghost of the departed
night the fragrance of its dewy dark soul
captured for a moment longer between the
great glow of the sky and the intense blaze
of the uncovered sea

   it was naturally difficult for heyst to keep
his mind from dw-elling on the nature and con-
sequences of this his latest departure from
the part of an unconcerned spectator yet he
had retained enough of his wrecked philosophy
to prevent him from asking himself conscious-
ly how it would end like the rest of us
who act all he could say to himself with a
somewhat affected grimness was

   we shall see

  this mood of grim doubt intruded on him
only when he was alone there were not
many such moments in his day now and he
did not like them when they came

  on that morning he had no time to grow
uneasy alma came out to join him long be-
fore the sun rising above the samburan
ridge swept the cool shadow of the early

morning clear off the roof under which they
had dwelt for more than thirty days

 she came out as on other mornings he
 had heard her light footsteps in the big room
 -the room where he had unpacked the cases
 from london-the room now lined with the
 backs of books half-way up on its three sides
 above the cases the fine matting met the
 ceiling of tightly stretched white calico in
 the dusk and coolness nothing gleamed except
 the gilt frame of the portrait of heysts fa-
 ther signed by a famous painter lonely in
 the middle of a wall

 heyst did not trrn round

  do you know what i was thinking of he
 asked

  no she said her tone betrayed always
 a shade of anxiety as if she were never cer-
 tain how a conversation with him would end
 she leaned on the guard-rail by his side
 no she repeated what was it she
 waited then rather with reluctance than
 shyness she asked were you thinking of
 me

  i was wondering when you were coming
 out said heyst still without looking at the
 girl-to whom after several experimental es-
 says in combining detached letters and loose
 syllables he had given the name of lena

 she remarked after a pause

  i was not very far from you

  apparently you were not near enough for
 me

   ou could have called me she said

  and i wasnt so long doing my hair

  apparently it was too long for me

  well you were thinking of me anyhow

 i am glad of it do you know it seems to
 me somehow that if you were to stop think-
 ing of me i shouldnt be in the world at all
 he turned round and looked at her she
 often said things which surprised him a
 vague smile faded away on her lips before
 his scrutiny

 what is it he asked is it a re-
 proach

 a reproach why how could it be she
 defended herself

  well what did it mean he insisted

  wrhat i said-just what i said why
 arent you fair

 ah this at least is a reproach

 she colored to the roots of her hair

  it looks as if you were trying to make
 out that i am disagreeable she murmured
 am i you will make me afraid to open
 my mouth presently i shall end by believ-
 ing i am no good

  her head drooped a little he looked at
her smooth low brow the faintly colored
cheeks and the red lips parted slightly with
the gleam of her teeth within

    and then i wont be any good she added
with conviction that i wont i can only
be what you think i am

  he made a slight movement she put her
hand on his arm without raising her head and
went on her voice animated in the stillness of
her body

    it is so it couldnt be any other way
with a girl like me and a man like you here
we are-we two alone-and i cant even tell
where we are

   a very well-known spot of the globe
heyst uttered gently there must have
been at least fifty thousand circulars issued
at the time-a hundred and fifty thousand
more likely my friend was looking after that
and his ideas were large and his belief very
strong of us two it was he who had the
faith a hundred and fifty thousand cer-
tainly

   what is it you mean she asked in a
low tone

    what should i find fault with you for
heyst went on  for being amiable good
gracious-and pretty

   a silence fell then she said

   its all right that you should think that
of me theres no one here to think anything
of us good or bad

   the rare timbre of her voice gave a special
value to what she uttered the indefinable
emotion which certain intonations gave him
he was aware was more physical than moral
every time she spoke to him she seemed to
abandon to him something of herself-some-
thing excessively subtle and inexpressible to
which he was infinitely sensible which he
would have missed horribly if she were to go
away

  while he was looking into her eyes she
raised her bare forearm out of its short
sleeve and held it in the air till he noticed it
and hastened to pose his great bronze mus-
tache on the whiteness of the skin then
they went in

   wang immediately appeared in front and
squatting on his heels began to potter mys-
teriously about some plants at the foot of the
veranda when heyst and the girl came out
again the chinaman had gone in his peculiar
manner which suggested vanishing out of ex-
istence rather than out of sight a process of
evaporation rather than of movement they
descended the steps looking at each other
victory



and started off smartly across the cleared
ground but they were not ten yards away
when without perceptible stir or sound wang
materialized inside the empty room

   the chinaman stood still with roaming eyes
examining the walls as if for signs for in-
scriptions exploring the floor as if for pitfalls
for dropped coins then he cocked his head
slightly at the profile of heysts father pen
in hand above a white sheet of paper on a
crimson table-cloth and moving forward
noiselessly began to clear away the breakfast
things

   though he proceeded without haste the un-
erring precision of his movements the abso-
lute soundlessness of the operation gave it
something of the quality of a conjuring trick
and the trick having been performed wang
vanished from the scene to materialize pres-
ently in front of the house he materialized
walking away from it with no visible or guess-
able intention but at the end of some ten
paces he stopped made a half turn and put
his hand up to shade his eyes 

   the sun had topped the gray ridge of sam-
buran the great morning shadow was gone
and far away in the devouring sunshine wang
was in time to see number one and the wom-
an two remote white specks against the somber
line of the forest in a moment they vanished
with the smallest display of action wang also
vanished from the sunlight of the clearing

   heyst and lena entered the shade of the
forest path which crossed the island and
which near its highest point had been blocked
by felled trees but their intention was not
to go so far after keeping to the path for
some distance they left it at a point where
the forest was bare of undergrowth and the
tiees festooned with creepers stood clear of
one another in the gloom of their own ma-
king here and there great splashes of light
lay on the ground

   they moved silent in the great stillness
breathing the calmness the infinite isolation
the repose of a slumber without dreams they
emerged at the upper limit of vegetation
among some rocks and in a depression of the
sharp slope like a small platform they turned
about and looked from on high over the sea
lonely its color effaced by sunshine its hori-
zon a heat mist a mere unsubstantial shim-
mer in the pale and blinding infinity overhung
by the darker blaze of the sky

    it makes my head swim the girl mut-
tered shutting her eyes and putting her hand
on his shoulder

   heyst gazing to the southward exclaimed

       sail ho

     a moment of silence ensued

      it must be very far away he went on
  i dont think you could see it some native
 craft making for the moluccas probably
 come we mustnt stay here

     with his arm round her waist he led her
 down a little distance and they settled them-
 selves in the shade she seated on the ground
 he a little lower reclining at her feet

     you dont like to look at the sea frpm
 up there he said after a time

     she shook her head that empty space was
 to her the abomination of desolation but she
 only said again

  it makes my head swim

  too big he inquired

  too lonely it makes my heart sink too
 she added in a low voice as if confessing a
 secret

   i am afraid said heyst  that you would
  be justified in reproaching me for these sen-
  sations but what would you have

  his tone was playful but his eyes directed
  at her face were serious she protested

 i am not feeling lonely with you-not a
 bit it is only when we come up to that
 place and i look at all that water and all that
 light-

  we will never come here again then he
 interrupted her

 she remained silent for a while returning
 his gaze till he removed it

   it seems as if everything that there is had
  gone under she said

  reminds you of the story of the deluge
 muttered the man stretched at her feet and
 looking at them  the vision of a world
 destroyed he mused aloud  would you be
 sorry for it

  i should be sorry for the happy people in
 it she said simply

 his gaze traveled up her figure and reached
 her face where he seemed to detect the veiled
 glow of intelligence as one gets a glimpse of
 the sun through the clouds

 i should have thought its they specially
 who ought to have been congratulated dont
 you

 oh yes-i understand what you mean
 but there were forty days before it was all
 over

 you seem to be in possession of all the
 details

 heyst spoke just to say something rather
 than to gaze at her in silence she was not
 looking at him

  sunday-school she murmured  i went

munseys magazine

regularly from the time i was eight till i was
thirteen we lodged in the north of london
off the kingsland road it wrasnt a bad time
father was earning good money then the
woman of the house used to pack me off in
the afternoon with her own girls she was a
good woman her husband was in the post-
office sorter or something such a quiet man
he used to go off after supper for night duty
sometimes then one day they had a row
and broke up the home i remember i cried
when we had to pack up all of a sudden and
go into other lodgings i never knew what it
was though-

   the deluge muttered heyst absently

  he felt intensely aware of her personality
as if this was the first moment of leisure he
had found to look at her since they had come
together the peculiar timbre of her voice
with its modulations of audacity and sadness
would have given interest to the most inane
chatter but she was no chatterer she was
rather silent with a capacity for immobility
an upright stillness as when resting on the
concert platform between the musical num-
bers her feet crossed her hands reposing on
her lap

  but even in the intimacy of their life her
gray unabashed gaze forced upon him the sen-
sation of something inexplicable reposing with-
in her stupidity or inspiration weakness or
force-or simply an abysmal emptiness reserv-
ing itself even in the moments of complete
surrender

  during a long pause she did not look at him
then suddenly as if the word  deluge  had
stuck in her mind she asked looking up at
the cloudless sky

   does it ever rain here

   there is a season when it rains almost
every day said heyst surprised  there
are also thunder-storms we had once a mud-
shower

   mud-shower

   our neighbor there was shooting up ashes
he sometimes clears his red-hot gullet like
that and a thunder-storm came along at the
same time it was very messy but our neigh-
bor is generally well-behaved-just smokes
quietly as he did that day when i first showed
you the smudge in the sky from the schooners
deck hes a good-natured lazy fellow of a
volcano

   i saw a mountain smoking like that be-
fore she said staring at the slender stem of
a tree-fern some dozen feet in front of her
 it wasnt very long after we left home-
some few days though i was so ill at first

that i lost count of days a smoking moun-
tain-i cant think what they called it

 vesuvius perhaps suggested heyst

 thats the name

   i saw it too years ages ago said heyst
   on your way here 

 no long before i ever thought of com-
ing into this part of the world i was yet a

boy

  she turned and looked at him attentively
as if seeking to discover some trace of that
boyhood in the mature face of the man with
the hair thin at the top and the long thick
mustache heyst stood the frank examina-
tion with a playful smile hiding the profound
effect these veiled gray eyes produced-
whether on his heart or on his nerves whether
sensuous or spiritual tender or irritating he
was unable to say

   well princess of samburan he said at
last have i found favor in your sight

  she seemed to w-ake up and shook her head
 i was thinking she murmured very low
thought action - so many snares if
you begin to think you will be unhappy

   i wasnt thinking of myself she de-
clared with a simplicity which took heyst
aback somewhat

   on the lips of a moralist that would sound
like a rebuke he said half seriously but
i wont suspect you of being one moralists
and i havent been friends for many years
she had listened with an air of attention
 i understood you had no friends she
said  i am pleased that theres nobody to
find fault with you for what you have done
i like to think that i am in no ones way
heyst would have said something but she
did not give him time unconscious of the
movement he made she went on

   what i wras thinking to myself was why
are you here

  heyst let himself sink on his elbow again
 if by  you  you mean  we -well you
know why we are here

she bent her gaze down at him

   no it isnt that i meant before-all that
time before you came across me and guessed
at once that i was in trouble with no one to
turn to and you know it was desperate
trouble too

  her voice fell on the last wrords as if she
would end there but there was something so
expectant in heysts attitude as he sat at her
feet looking up at her steadily that she con-
tinued after drawing a short quick breath
it was really i told you i had been
worried before by bad fellows it made me

unhappy disturbed-angry too but oh how
i hated hated hated that man

    that man  was the florid schomberg with
the military bearing benefactor of white men
- decent food to eat in decent company -
mature victim of belated passion the girl
shuddered the characteristic harmoniousness
of her face became as it were decomposed
for an instant heyst was startled

    why think of it now he cried

    its because i was cornered that time it
wasn t as before i was worse ever so much
i wished i could die of my fright and yet its
only now that i begin to understand what a
horror it might have been yes only now
since we-

   heyst stirred a little

    came here he finished

   her tenseness relaxed her flushed face went
gradually back to its normal tint

    yes she said indifferently but at the
same time she gave him a stealthy glance of
passionate appreciation and then her face
took on a melancholy cast her whole figure
drooped imperceptibly  but you were com-
ing back here anyhow she asked

   yes i was only waiting for davidson
yes i was coming back here to these ruins-
to wang who perhaps did not expect to see
me again its impossible to guess at the way
that chinaman draws his conclusions and how
he looks upon one

    dont talk about him he makes me feel
uncomfortable talk about yourself

   about myself i see you are still busy
with the mystery of my existence here but
it isnt at all mysterious a man drifts the
most successful men have drifted into their
successes i dont want to tell you that this
is a success you wouldnt believe me if i
did it isnt neither is it the ruinous failure
it looks it proves nothing unless perhaps
some hidden weakness in my character-and
even that is not certain

  he looked fixedly at her and with such
grave eyes that she felt obliged to smile faint-
ly at him since she did not understand what
he meant her smile was reflected still faint-
er on his lips

    this does not advance you much in your
inquiry he went on and in truth your
question is unanswerable but facts have a
certain positive value and i will tell you a
fact one day i met a cornered man i use
the word because it expresses the mans situa-
tion exactly and because you just used it
yourself he would have preferred to be
killed outright-that is to have his soul des-

patched to another world rather than to be
robbed of his substance his verv insignificant
substance in this i saw that he believed in
another world because being cornered as i
have told you he went down on his knees and
prayed what do you think of that

   heyst paused she looked at him earnestly

   you didnt make fun of him for that
she said

   heyst made a brusk movement of protest

   my dear girl i am not a ruffian he
cried then returning to his usual tone  i
didnt even have to conceal a smile some-
how it didnt look a smiling matter no it
was not funny it was rather pathetic he
was so representative of all the past victims
of the great joke but it is by folly alone
that the world moves and so it is a respect-
able thing upon the whole and besides he
was what one would call a good man i dont
mean especially because he had offered up a
prayer no he was really a decent fellow
he was quite unfitted for this world he was
a failure a good man cornered-a sight for
the gods for no decent mortal cares to look
at that sort a thought seemed to occur to
him he turned his face to the girl  and
you who have been cornered too-did you
think of offering a prayer

   neither her eyes nor a single one of her
features moved the least bit she only let
fall the words

    i am not what they call a good girl

    that sounds evasive said heyst after a
short silence well the good fellow did
pray and after he had confessed to it i was
struck by the comicality of the situation no
dont misunderstand me-i am not alluding
to his act of course what captivated my
fancy was that i axel heyst the most de-
tached of creatures in this earthly captivity
the veriest tramp on this earth an indifferent
stroller going through the worlds bustle-
that i should have been there to step into
the situation as an agent of providence i
got him out of his corner you know

    you saved a man for fun-is that what
you mean just for fun

    why this tone of suspicion remonstrated
 heyst i suppose the sight of this par-
 ticular distress was disagreeable to me what
 you call fun came afterward when it dawned
 on me that i was for him a walking breathing
 incarnate proof of the efficacy of prayer his
 gratitude was simply frightful funny posi-
 tion wasnt it

   the boredom came later when we lived
together on board his ship i had in a mo-
	munseys

 ment of inadvertence created for myself a
 tie how to define it precisely i dont know
 one gets attached in a way to people one has
 done something for but is that friendship

 i am not sure what it was i only know that

 	he who forms a tie is lost the germ of cor-
 ruption has entered into him

    heysts tone was light with the flavor of
 playfulness which seasoned all his speeches
 and seemed to be of the very essence of his
 thoughts the girl e had come across of
 whom he had possessed himself to whose
 presence he was not yet accustomed with
 whom he did not yet know how to live that
 human being so near and still so strange gave
 him a greater sense of his own reality than
 he had ever known in all his life

           xix	

   with her knees drawn up lena rested her
 elbows on them and held her head in both

 her hands	

   are you tired of sitting here heyst

  asked

    an almost imperceptible negative movement
 of the head was all the answer she made

     why are you looking so serious he pur-
 sued and immediately thought that habitual
 seriousness in the long run was much more
 bearable than constant gaiety however
 this expression suits you exceedingly he add-
 ed not diplomatically but because by the
 tendency of his taste it was a true statement

  and as long as i can be certain that it is
 not boredom which gives you this severe air
 i am willing to sit here and look at you till
 you are ready to go

      and this was true he was still under the
    fresh sortilege of their common life the sur-
    prise of novelty the flattered vanity of his
    possession of this woman for a man must
    feel that unless he has ceased to be masculine

      her eyes moved in his direction rested on
    him then returned to their stare into the
    deeper gloom at the foot of the straight tree-
    trunks whose spreading crowns were slowly
    withdrawing their shade the warm air
    stirred slightly about her motionless head
    she would not look at him from some ob-
    scure fear of betraying herself she felt in
    her innermost depths an irresistible desire to
    give herself up to him more completely by
    some act of absolute sacrifice

     this was something of which he seemed to
   have no idea he was a strange being without
   needs she felt his eyes fixed upon her and
   as he kept silent she said uneasily-for she
   didnt know what his silences might mean

magazine

    and so you lived with that friend-that
  good man	 

     excellent fellow heyst responded with
  a readiness that she did not expect but it
  was a weakness on my part i really didn t
  want to only he wouldnt let me off and i
  couldnt explain he was the sort of man to
  whom you cant explain anything he was
  extremely sensitive and it would have been a
  tigerish thing to do to mangle his delicate
  feelings by the sort of plain speaking that
  would have been necessary he was extreme-
  ly easy to live with but then he got hold
  of this coal idea-or rather the idea got hold
  of him it was going to make his fortune
  my fortune everybodys fortune in past
  years in moments of doubt that will come to
  a man determined to remain free from the
  absurdities of existence i often asked myself
  with a momentary dread in what way would
  life try to get hold of me and this was the
  way he got it into his head that he could
  do nothing without me and was i now he
  asked me to spurn and ruin him well one
  morning-i wonder if he had gone down on
  his knees to pray-one morning i gave in
  heyst tugged violently at a tuft of dried
  grass and cast it away from him with a
  nervous gesture

     i gave in he repeated

    looking toward him with a movement of
  her eyes only the girl noticed the strong
  feeling on his face with that intense interest
  which his person awakened in her mind and

  ing only a moody expression

     its difficult to resist where nothing mat-

    grain of freakishness in my nature it amused
    me to go about uttering silly commonplace
    phrases i believe i was never so well thought
    of in the islands till i began to jabber com-
    mercial gibberish like the veriest idiot upon
    my word i believe that i was actually respect-
    ed for a time i was as grave as an owl over

    he understood something about coal and if i
    had been aware that he knew nothing of it as
    in fact he didnt well-i dont know what i
    could have done to stop him in one way or
    another i should have had to be loyal truth

  heyst made as if to get on his feet the
girl extended her arm to arrest him and he
remained staring in a sitting posture propped
on one arm observing her indefinable ex-
pression of anxiety as if she were unable to
draw breath

  what has come to you he insisted feel-
ing strangely unwilling to move to touch her

   nothing she swallowed painfully  of
course it cant be what name did you say

i didnt hear it properly

   name repeated heyst dazedly  i only
mentioned morrison its the name of that
man of whom ive been speaking what of
it

   and you mean to say that he was your
friend

   you have heard enough to judge for your-
self you know as much of our connection
as i know myself the people in this part of
the world went by appearances and called us
friends as far as i can remember appear-
ances-what more what better can you ask
for in fact you cant have better you
cant have anything else

   you are trying to confuse me with your
talk she cried  you cant make fun of
this

  cant well no i cant its a pity
perhaps it would have been the best way
said heyst in a tone which for him could be
called gloomy  unless one could forget the
silly business altogether his faint playful-
ness of manner and speech returned like a
habit one has schooled oneself into even be-
fore his forehead had cleared completely

 but why are you looking so hard at me
oh i dont object and i shall try not to 
flinch your eyes-

  he was looking straight into them and as
a matter of fact had forgotten all about the
late morrison at that moment

  no he exclaimed suddenly what an
impenetrable girl you are lena with those
gray eyes of yours windows of the soul as
some poet has said the fellow must have
been a glazier by vocation well nature has
provided excellently for the shyness of your
soul

  when he ceased speaking the girl came to
herself with a catch of her breath he heard
her voice the varied charm of which he
thought he knew so well saying with an un-
familiar intonation

   and that partner of yours is dead

   morrison oh yes as ive told you
he-

  you never told me

 

  didnt i i thought i did or rather i
thought you must know it seems impossible
that anybody with whom i speak should not
know that morrison is dead

  she lowered her eyelids and heyst was
startled by something like an expression of
horror on her face

  morrison she whispered in an appalled
tone morrison

  her head drooped

  unable to see her features heyst could
tell from her voice that for some reason or
other she was profoundly moved by the syl-
lables of that unromantic name a thought
flashed through his head -could she have
known morrison but the mere difference of
their origins made it wildly improbable

  this is very extraordinary he said
 have you ever heard the name before

  her head moved quickly several times in
tiny affirmative nods as if she could not trust
herself to speak or even to look at him she
was biting her lower lip

   did you ever know anybody of that
name he asked

  the girl answered by a negative sign and
then at last she spoke jerkily as if forcing
herself against some doubt or fear she had
heard of that very man she told heyst

  impossible he said positively you
are mistaken you couldnt have heard of
him its-

  he stopped short with the thought that to
talk like this was perfectly useless that one
doesnt argue against thin air

   but i did hear of him only i didnt know
then i couldnt guess that it was your partner
they were talking about

   talking about my partner repeated
heyst slowly

   no her mind seemed almost as be-
wildered as full of incredulity as his  no
they wrere talking of you really only i didnt
know it

   who were they heyst raised his voice
 tell me who was talking of me talking
where

  with the first question he had lifted him-
self from his reclining position at the last
he was on his knees before her their heads
on a level

   why in that town in that hotel where
else could it have been she said

  the idea of being talked about was always
novel to heysts simplified conception of him-
self for a moment he was as much surprised
as if he had believed himself to be a mere
gliding shadow among men besides he had




munseys magazine

in him a half-unconscious notion that he was
above the level of island gossip

    but you said first that it was of morrison
they talked he remarked to the girl sinking
on his heels and no longer much interested
 strange that you should have the oppor-
tunity to hear any talk at all i was rather
under the impression that you never saw any-
body belonging to the town except from the
platform

    you forget that i was not living with the
other girls she said  after meals they
used to go back to the pavilion but i had to
stay in the hotel and do my sewing or what
not in the room where they talked

   i didnt think of that by the bye you
never told me who they were

   why that horrible red-faced beast she
said with all the energy of disgust which the
mere thought of the hotel-keeper provoked in
her

  oh schomberg heyst murmured care-
lessly

   he talked to the boss-to zangiacomo i
mean i had to sit there that devil-woman
sometimes wouldnt let me go away i mean
mrs zangiacomo

   i guessed murmured heyst  she liked
to torment you in a variety of ways but it is
really strange that the hotel-keeper should
talk of morrison to zangiacomo as far as
i can remember he saw very little of morri-
son professionally he knew many others
much better

   the girl shuddered slightly

   that was the only name i ever over-
heard i would get as far away from them
as i could to the other end of the room but
when that beast started shouting i could not
help hearing you dont seem to want to
know what he was saving

   about poor morrison it couldnt have
been anything bad for the poor fellow was
innocence itself and then you know he is
dead and nothing can possibly matter to him
now

  but i tell you that it was of you he was
talking she cried he was saying that
morrisons partner first got all there was to
get out of him and then and then-well as
good as murdered him-sent him out to die
somewhere

   you believed that of me said heyst
after a moment of perfect stillness

   i didnt know it had anything to do with
you schomberg was talking of some swede
how was i to know it was only when you
began telling me about how you came here-

   and now you have my version heyst
forced himself to speak quietly  so thats
how the business looked from outside he
muttered bitterly

   i remember him saying that everybody in
these parts knew the story the girl added
breathlessly

   strange that it should hurt me  mused
heyst to himself yet it does i seem to be
as much of a fool as those everybodies who
know the story-and no doubt believe it can
you remember any more he addressed the
girl in a grimly polite tone  ive often
heard of the moral advantages of seeing one-
self as others see one let us investigate
further cant you recall something else that
everybody knows

  oh dont laugh she cried

   did i laugh i assure you i was not
aware i wont ask you whether you believe
the hotel-keepers version surely you must
know the value of human judgment

  she unclasped her hands moved them
slightly and twined her fingers as before
protest assent was there to be nothing
more he was relieved when she spoke in
that warm and wonderful voice which in itself
comforted and fascinated ones heart which
made her lovable

   i heard this before you and i ever spoke
to each other it went out of my memory
afterward everything went out of my mem-
ory then and i was glad of it it was a fresh
start for me with you-and you know it i
wish i had forgotten who i was-that would
have been best for me and i very nearly did
forget

  he was moved by the vibrating quality of
the last words she seemed to be talking low
of some wonderful enchantment in mysteri-
ous terms of special significance he thought
that if she only could talk to him in some un-
known tongue she would enslave him alto-
gether by the sheer beauty of the sound sug-
gesting infinite depths of wisdom and feeling

   but she went on  the name stuck in
my head it seems and when you mentioned
it-

   it broke the spell muttered heyst in
angry disappointment as if he had been de-
ceived in some hope

  the girl from her position a little above
him surveyed with still eyes the abstracted
silence of the man on whom she now depend-
ed with a completeness of which she had not
been vividly conscious before because till
then she had never felt herself swinging be-
tween the abyss of earth and heaven in the

hollow of his arm what if he should grow
weary of the burden

   and moreover nobody had ever believed
that tale

  heyst came out with an abrupt burst of
sound which made her open her steady eyes
wider with an effect of immense surprise it
was a purely mechanical effect because she
was neither surprised nor puzzled in fact
she could understand him better then than at
any moment since she first set eyes on him
he laughed scornfully

  what am i thinking of he cried- as
if it could matter to me what anybody had
ever said or believed from the beginning of
the world till the crack of doom

   i never heard you laugh till to-day she
observed  this is the second time

  he scrambled to his feet and towered above
her

   thats because when ones heart has been
broken into in the way you have broken into
mine all sorts of weaknesses are free to en-
ter in as well-shame anger stupid indigna-
tion stupid fears - and stupid laughter too
i wonder what interpretation you are putting
on it lena

   it wasnt gay certainly she said  but
why are you angry with me are you sorry
you took me away from those beasts i told
you who i was you could see it
heavens he muttered he had regained
his command of himself  i assure you i
could see much more than you could tell me
i could see quite a lot that you dont even
suspect yet but you cant be seen quite
through

  he sank to the ground by her side and
took her hand she asked gently

  what more do you want from me

  he made no sound for a time

   the impossible i suppose he said very
low as one makes a confidence and pressing
the hand he grasped

  it lay motionless in his and did not return
the pressure he shook his head as if to
drive away the thought of this and added in
a louder light tone

   nothing less and it isnt because i think
little of what ive got already oh no it
is because i think so much of this possession
of mine that i cant have it complete enough

i know its unreasonable you cant hold back
anything-now

   indeed i couldnt she whispered letting
her hand lie passive in his tight grasp  i
only wish i could give you something more
or better or whatever it is you want

  he was touched by the sincere accent of
these simple words

   i tell you what you can do-you can tell
me whether you would have gone with me
like this if you had known of whom that
abominable idiot of a hotel-keeper was speak-
ing a murderer-no less

   but i didnt know you at all then she
cried  and i had the sense to understand
what he was saying it wasnt murder really
i never thought it was

   what made him invent such an atrocity
heyst exclaimed  he seems a stupid animal
he is stupid how did he manage to hatch
that pretty tale- have i a particularly vile
countenance is black selfishness written all
over my face or is that sort of thing so
universally human that it might be said of
anybody

 it wasnt murder she insisted earnestly
 i know i understand it was worse
as to killing a man which would be a com-
paratively decent thing to do well-i have
never done that

   why should you do it she asked in a
frightened voice

   my dear girl you dont know the sort of
life i have been leading in unexplored coun-
tries in the wilds its difficult to give you
an idea there are men who havent been in
such tight places as i have found myself in
who have had to-to shed blood as the say-
ing is even the wilds hold prizes which
tempt some people but  had no schemes no
plans-and not even great firmness of mind
to make me unduly obstinate i was simply
moving on while the others perhaps were
going somewhere an indifference as to roads
and purposes makes one meeker as it were
and i may say truly too that i never did
care i wont say for life-i had scorned what
people call by that name from the first-but
for being alive i dont know if that is what
men call courage but i doubt it very much
you you have no courage she pro-
tested

   i really dont know not the sort that
always itches for a weapon for i have never
been anxious to use one in the quarrels that
a man gets into in the most innocent way
sometimes i wont say that i have never
been in danger on the contrary i have and
fairly often too but when it came from my
fellow creatures whether through careless-
ness or impudence or natural aversion from
bloodshed i have never jumped to sudden
conclusions i let the danger develop and

passes away the differences for which men
murder one another are like everything else
they do the most contemptible the most piti-
ful things to look back upon no ive never
killed a man or loved a woman-not even in
my thoughts not even in my dreams

   he raised her hand to his lips and let them
 rest on it for a space during which she moved
 a little closer to him after the lingering kiss
 he did not relinquish his hold

    to slay to love-the great enterprises of
 life for man and i have no experience of
 either you must forgive me anything that
 may have appeared to you awkward in my
 behavior inexpressive in my speeches un-
 timely in my silences

   he moved uneasily a little disappointed by
 her silence but indulgent to it and feeling
 in this moment of perfect quietness that in
 holding her surrendered hand he had found a
 closer communion than they had ever achieved
 before but even then there still lingered in
 him a sense of incompleteness not altogether
 overcome - which it seemed nothing ever
 would overcome-the fatal imperfection of
 all the gifts of life which makes of them a
 delusion and a snare

  all of a sudden he squeezed her hand
angrily

  i i to do a deadly wrong to my poor
morrison he cried i who could not
bear to hurt his feelings i who respected
his very madness yes this madness the
wreck of which you can see lying about the
jetty of black diamond bay what else could
i do he insisted on regarding me as his
savior he was always restraining the eternal
obligation on the tip of his tongue till i was
burning with shame at his gratitude what
could i do he was going to repay me with
this infernal coal and i had to join him as
one joins a childs game in a nursery one
would no more have thought of humiliating
him than one would think of humiliating a
child what power there must be in words
only imperfectly heard - for you did not
lister with particular care did you what
were they i wonder what evil effort of
invention drove them into that idiots mouth
out of his lying throat if you were to try
to remember they would perhaps convince
me too

   i didnt listen she protested  what
was it to me what they said of anybody
he was saying that there never were such
loving friends to look at as you two that
you couldnt live without morrison and then
when you got all you wanted out of him and

got thoroughly tired of him too you kicked
him out to go home and die

   indignation with an undercurrent of some
other feeling rang in these quoted words ut-
tered in her pure and enchanting voice she
ceased abruptly and lowered her long dark
lashes as if mortally weary sick at heart

    of course why shouldnt you get tired of
 that or any other-company you arent like
 any one else and-and the thought of it made
 me unhappy suddenly but indeed i did not
 believe anything bad of you i-

   a brusk movement of his arm flinging her
hand away stopped her short heyst had
again lost control of himself he would have
shouted if shouting had been in his character

   no this earth must be the appointed
hatching planet of calumny enough to furnish
the whole universe i feel a disgust at my
own person as if i had tumbled into some
filthy hole pah and you-all you can say
is that you wont judge me that you-

   she raised her head at this attack though
indeed he had not turned to her

    i dont believe anything bad of you che
 repeated  i couldnt

   he made a gesture as if to say

    thats sufficient

   in his soul and in his body he experienced
a nervous reaction from tenderness all at
once without transition he detested her but
only for a moment he remembered that she
was pretty and more that she had a special
grace in the intimacy of life she had the
secret of individuality which excites-and
escapes

   he scrambled to his feet briskly and be-
gan to walk to and fro presently his hidden
fury fell into dust within him like a crazy
structure leaving behind emptiness desola-
tion regret his resentment was not against
the girl but against life itself-that common-
est of snares in which he felt himself caught
seeing clearly the plot of plots and uncon-
soled by the lucidity of his mind

   he swerved in his rapid tramp and step-
ping up to her sank to the ground by her side
before she could make a movement or even
turn her head his way he took her in his arms
and kissed her on the heavy well-shaped lips
within which the teeth shone with a peculiar
light he drank on them the moisture of a
tear fallen there-a drop of sorrow whose
bitterness surprised him because he had not
noticed that she had been crying

  he had never seen her cry it was like
another appeal to his tenderness-and a new
seduction the girl glanced at him moved

suddenly away and averted her face with
her hand she signed imperiously to him to
leave her alone-a command which heyst did
not obey he found no resistance

xx

  when she opened her eyes at last and sat
up heyst scrambled quickly to his feet and
went to pick up her cork helmet which had
rolled a little way off meanwhile she busied
herself in doing up her hair plaited on the
top of her head in two heavy dark tresses
which had come loose

  he tendered her the helmet in silence and
waited a while as if unwilling to hear the
sound of his own voice

   we had better go down now he suggest-
ed in a low tone

  he extended his hand to help her up while
doing this he had the intention to smile but
abandoned it at the nearer sight of her still
face in which was depicted infinite lassitude

  on their way to regain the forest path they
had to pass through the spot from which the
view to the westward could be obtained the
flaming abyss of emptiness the liquid un-
dulating glare the tragic brutality of the
light made her long for the friendly night
with its stars stilled by an austere spell for
the velvety dark sky and the mysterious great
shadow of the sea conveying peace to the
day-weary heart

  she put her hand to her eyes behind her
back heyst spoke gently

   let us get on lena

  she walked ahead in silence heyst re-
marked that they had never been out before
during the hottest hours it would do her no
good he feared

  his solicitude pleased and soothed her she
felt more and more like herself-a poor lon-
don girl playing in an orchestra and snatched
out from the humiliations the squalid dangers
of a miserable existence by a man like whom
there was not there could not be another in
this world she felt this with elation with
uneasiness with an intimate pride-and with
a peculiar sinking of the heart

   i am not easily knocked out by any such
thing as heat she said decisively

   yes but i dont forget that youre not a
tropical bird

 you werent born in these parts either

   no and perhaps i havent even your
physique i am a transplanted being trans-
planted i ought to call myself uprooted-an
unnatural state of existence but a man is
supposed to stand anything

       

  she looked back at him and received a smile
he told her to keep in the shelter of the forest
path which was very still and close full of
heat if free from glare now and then they
had glimpses of the companys old clearing
blazing with light in which the black stumps
of trees stood charred without shadows
miserable and sinister

  they crossed the open in a direct line for
the bungalow on the veranda they fancied
they had a glimpse of a vanishing wang
though the girl was not at all sure that she
had seen anything move heyst had no
doubts

   wang has been looking out for us we

are late

   was he i thought i saw something white
for a moment and then i did not see it any
more

  thats it-he vanishes its a very re-
markable gift in that chinaman

  are they all like that she asked with
naive curiosity and uneasiness

   not in such perfection said heyst
amused

  he noticed with approval that she was not
heated by the walk the drops of perspira-
tion on her forehead were like dew on the
cool white petal of a flower he looked at
her figure of grace and strength solid and
supple with an ever-growing appreciation

   go in and rest yourself for a quarter of
an hour and then mr wang will give us
something to eat he said

  they had found the table laid when they
came together again and sat down to it wang
materialized without a sound unheard un-
called and did his office which being ac-
complished at a given moment he was not

  a great silence brooded over samburan-
the silence of the great heat that seems preg-
nant with fatal issues like the silence of
ardent thought heyst remained alone in the
big room the girl seeing him take up a
book had retreated to her chamber

  heyst sat down under his fathers portrait
and the abominable calumny crept back into
his recollection the taste of it came on his
lips nauseating and corrosive like some kinds
of poison he was tempted to spit on the
floor naively in sheer unsophisticated disgust
of the physical sensation

  he shook his head surprised at himself
he was not used to receive his intellectual
impressions in that wtay-reflected in move-
ments of carnel emotion he stirred impa-
tiently in his chair and raised the book to
his eyes with both hands


muxseys magazine

  it was one of his fathers he opened it
haphazard and his eyes fell on the middle of
the page the elder heyst had written of
everything-of space and of time of animals
and of stars analyzing ideas and actions the
laughter and the frowns of men and the
grimaces of their agony the son read
shrinking into himself composing his face as
if under the authors eye with a vivid con-
sciousness of the portrait on his right hand a
little above his head a wonderful presence in
its heavy frame on the flimsy wall of mats
looking exiled and at home out of place and
masterful in the painted immobility of profile

  of the stratagems of life the most cruel is the
consolation of love-the most subtle too for the
desire is the bed of dreams

  he turned the pages of the little volume
 storm and dust glancing here and there at
the broken text of reflections maxims short
phrases enigmatical sometimes and some-
times eloquent it seemed to him that he
was hearing his fathers voice speaking and
ceasing to speak again

  startled at first he ended by a smile there
was a clferm in the illusion he abandoned
himself to the half-belief that something of
his father dwelt yet on earth-a ghostly voice
audible to the ear of his own flesh and blood
with what strange serenity mingled with ter-
rors had that man considered the universal
nothingness he had plunged into it head-
long perhaps to render death the answer that
faced one at every inquiry more supportable

  heyst stirred and the ghostly voice ceased
but his eyes followed the words on the last
page of the book

  men of tormented conscience or of a criminal
imagination are aware of much that minds of a
peaceful resigned cast do not even suspect it is
not poets alone who dare descend into the abyss
of infernal regions or even who dream of such
a descent the most inexpressive of human be-
ings must have said to himself at one time or
another

   anything but this  

  we all have our instants of clairvoyance they
are not very helpful the character of the
scheme does not permit that or anything else to
be helpful

  clairvoyance or no clairvoyance men love their
captivity to the unknown force of negation
they prefer the miserably tumbled bed of their
servitude man alone can give one the disgust
of pity yet i find it easier to believe in the mis-
fortune of mankind than in its wickedness

  these were the last words heyst lowered

the book to his knees lenas voice spoke
above his drooping head

   you sit there as if you were unhappy

   i thought you were asleep he said

   i was lying down right enough but i
never closed my eyes

   the rest would hare done you good after
our walk didnt you try

  i was lying down i tell you but sleep i
couldnt

  and you made no sound what want of
sincerity or did you want to be alone for a
time

  i-alone she murmured

  he noticed her eying the book and got up
to put it back in the bookcase when he
turned round he saw that she had dropped
into the chair-it was the one she always used
-and looked as if her strength had suddenly
gone from her leaving her only her youth
which seemed very pathetic very much at his
mercy he moved quickly toward the chair

   tired are you its my fault taking you
up so high and keeping you out so long such
a windless day too

  she watched his concern her pose languid
her eyes raised to him but as unreadable as
ever he avoided looking into them for that
very reason he forgot himself in the con-
templation of those passive arms of these
defenseless lips and-yes one had to go back
to them-of these wide-open eyes something
wild in their stare made him think of sea-
birds in the cold murkiness of high latitudes

  he started when she spoke all the charm
of physical intimacy revealed suddenly in that
voice

  you should try to love me she said

  heyst made a slight movement of astonish-
ment

  try he muttered but it seems to
me- he broke off with a confused sensa-
tion of anger while at the same time he was
saying to himself that if he loved her he had
never told her so in so many words simple
words they died on his lips  what makes
you say that he asked

  she lowered her eyelids and turned her
head a little

   i have done nothing she said in a low
voice  its you who have been good help-
ful and tender to me perhaps you love me
for that-just for that or perhaps you love
me for company and because-well but
sometimes it seems to me that you can never
love me for myself only for myself as people
do love each other when it is to be forever

out again then still more faintly she added
an entreating do try

  these last words went straight to his heart
-the sound of them more than the sense
he did not know what to say either from
want of practise in dealing with women or
simply from his innate honesty of thought
all his defenses were broken now life had
him fairly by the throat but he managed
a smile though she was not looking at him
yes he did manage it-the well-known heyst
smile of playful courtesy so familiar to all
sorts and conditions of men in the islands

   my dear lena he said  it looks as if
you were trying to pick a very unnecessary
quarrel with me-of all people

  she mde no movement with his elbows
spread out he was twisting the ends of his
long mustache very masculine and perplexed
enveloped in the atmosphere of femininity as
in a cloud suspecting pitfalls and as if afraid
to move

   i must admit though he added  that
there is no one else and i suppose a certain
amount of quarreling is necessary for exist-
ence in this world

  he stopped struck afresh by the physical
and moral sense of the imperfection of their
relations-a sense which made him desire her
constant nearness before his eyes under his
hand and which when she was out of his
sight made her so vague so illusive and illu-
sory a promise that could not be embraced
and held

   no he began again  its possible that
i may be really capable of that which they
say i have done the point is that i havent
done it but it is an unpleasant subject to
me i ought to be ashamed to confess it-
but it is let us forget it theres that in
you lena which can console me for worse
things for uglier passages and if we forget
there are no voices here to remind us

  she had raised her head before he paused

   nothing can break in on us here he went
on

  as if there had been an appeal or a provo-
cation in her upward glance he bent down
and look her under the arms raising her
straight out of the chair into a sudden and
close embrace her alacrity to respond
which made her seem as light as a feather
warmed his heart at that moment more than
closer caresses had done before he had not
expected that ready impulse toward himself
which had been dormant in her passive atti-
tude

  he had just felt the clasp of her arms round

his neck when with a slight exclamation-
hes here-she disengaged herself and
bolted away into her room

xxi

  heyst was astounded looking all round
as if to take the whole room to witness of
this outrage he became aware of wang ma-
terialized in the doorway

   the intrusion was as surprising as anything
 could be in view of the strict regularity with
 which wang made himself visible heyst was
 tempted to laugh at first this practical com-
 ment on his affirmation that nothing could
 break in on them relieved the strain of his
 feelings he was a little vexed too

  the chinaman preserved a profound si-
lence

   what do you want here asked heyst
sternly

 boat out there said the chinaman

   where what do you mean boat
adrift in the straits

   some subtle change in wangs bearing sug-
gested his being out of breath but he did not
pant and his voice was steady

   no-row

  it was heyst now who was startled and
raised his voice

   malay man eh

  wang made a slight negative movement
with his head

   do you hear lena heyst called out
 wang says there is a boat in sight-some-
where near apparently wheres the boat
wang

    round the point said wang leaping into
 malay unexpectedly and in a loud voice
  white men three

    so close as that exclaimed heyst mov-
ing out on the veranda followed by wang
white men impossible

   over the clearing the shadows were already
lengthening the sun hung low a ruddy
glare lay on the burned black patch in front
of the bungalow and slanted on the ground
between the straight tall mastlike trees soar-
ing a hundred feet or more without a branch
the growth of bushes cut off all view of the
jetty from the veranda far away to the right
wangs hut or rather its dark roof of mats
could be seen above the bamboo fence which
insured the privacy of the alfuro woman

  the chinaman looked that way swiftly
heyst paused and then stepped back a pace
into the room

   white men lena apparently what are
you doing


munseys magazine

    i am just bathing my eyes a little the
 girls voice said from the inner room

   oh yes all right

    do you want me

    no you had better-i am going down
 to the jetty yes you had better stay in
 what an extraordinary thing

   it was so extraordinary that nobody could
 possibly appreciate how extraordinary it was
 but himself his mind was full of mere ex-
 clamations while his feet were carrying him
 swiftly in the direction of the jetty he fol-
 lowed the line of the rails escorted by wang

    where were you when you first saw the
 boat he asked over his shoulder

   wang explained in malay that he had gone
 to the shore end of the wharf to get a few
 lumps of coal from the big heap when hap-
 pening to raise his eyes from the ground he
 saw the boat-a white mans boat not a canoe
 he had good eyes he had seen the boat
 with the men at the oars and here wang
 made a particular gesture over his eyes as if
 his vision had received a blow he had turned
 at once and run to the house to report

   no mistake eh said heyst moving on
 at the very outer edge of the belt he
 stopped short wang halted behind him on
 the path till the voice of number one sharp-
 ly called the chinaman forward into the open
 he obeyed

    wheres that boat asked heyst forcibly
 nothing whatever was to be seen between
 the point and the jetty the stretch of black
 diamond bay was like a piece of purple
 shadow lustrous and empty clear of the
 land the open sea lay blue and opaque under
 the sun heysts eyes swept all over the offing
 till they met far off the dark cone of the
 volcano with its faint plume of smoke broad-
 ening and vanishing everlastingly at the top
 without altering its shape in the glowing trans-
 parency of the evening

    the fellow has been dreaming he mut-
 tered to himself

   he looked hard at the chinaman wang
 seemed turned into stone suddenly as if he
 had received a shock he started flung his
 arm out with a pointing forefinger and made
 guttural noises to the effect that there there
 there he had seen a boat

   heyst shrugged his shoulders wangs fin-
 ger was pointing at nothing it was very un-
 canny heyst thought of some strange hallu-
 cination unlikely enough but that a boat
 v ith three men in it should have sunk between
 the point and the jetty suddenly like a stone
 without leaving as much on the surface as a

 floating oar was still more unlikely the
 theory of a fantom boat would have been
 more credible than that

   confound it he muttered to himself
 he was unpleasantly affected by this mys-
 tery but now a simple explanation occurred
 to him he hastily stepped out on the wharf
 the boat if it had existed and had retreated
 could perhaps be seen from the far end of the
 long jetty

   nothing was to be seen heyst let his
 eyes roam idly over the sea he was so ab-
 sorbed in his perplexity that a hollow sound
 as of somebody falling down in a boat with
 a clatter of oars and spars failed to make
 him move for a moment it reached his ears
 plainly enough but he had failed to under-
 stand it at first

   when his mind seized its meaning he had
 no difficulty in locating the sound it had
 come from below-from under the jetty

   he ran back for a dozen yards or so and
 then looked over his sight plunged straight
 into the stern-sheets of a big boat the greater
 part of which was hidden from him by the
 planking of the jetty his eyes fell on the
 thin back of a man doubled up over the tiller
 in a queer uncomfortable attitude of droop-
 ing sorrow another man more directly be-
 low heyst sprawled on his back from gun-
 wale to gunwale half off the after thwart his
 head lower than his feet this second man
 glared wildly upward struggled to raise him-
 self but to all appearances was much too
 drunk to succeed

   the visible part of the boat contained also
 a flat leather trunk on which the first mans
 long legs were nervelessly tucked up a large
 earthenware jar with its wide mouth un-
 corked rolled out on the bottom boards from
 under the sprawling man

   heyst had never been so much astonished
 in his life he stared in dumb wonder at the
 strange boat s crew from the first he was
 positive that these men were not sailors they
 wore the white drill suit of tropical civiliza-
 tion but their apparition in a boat heyst
 could not connect with anything plausible
 the civilization of the tropics could have
 had nothing to do with it it was more like
 the myths current in polynesia of amazing
 strangers who arrive at an island gods or
 demons bringing good or evil to the inno-
 cence of the inhabitants - gifts of unknown
 things wrords never heard before

 heyst noticed a cork helmet floating along-
 side the boat evidently fallen from the head
 of the man doubled over the tiller who dis-
victory



 played a dark bony poll an oar too had
 been knocked overboard probably by the
 sprawling man who was still struggling be-
 tween the thwarts

   by this time heyst regarded the visitation
 no longer with surprise but with the sus-
 tained attention demanded by a difficult prob-
 lem with one foot posed on the string-piece
 and leaning on his raised knee he instinctively
 abstained from speaking his quiet gaze was
 taking in everything

   the sprawling man rolled off the thwart
 collapsed and most unexpectedly got on his
 feet he swayed dizzily spreading his arms
 out and uttered faintly a hoarse as if dreamv
 hello

    his upturned face was swollen red peeling
 all over the nose and cheeks his stare was
 irrational heyst perceived stains of dried
 blood all over the front of his dirty white
 coat and also on one sleeve

 whats the matter are you wounded
 the other glanced down reeled-one of his
 feet was inside a large pith hat-and recover-
 ing himself let out a dismal grating sound in
 the manner of a laugh

    blood-not mine thirsts the matter
 exhausteds the matter done up water
 man give us water

   thirst was in the very tone of his words
 alternating a broken croak and a faint throaty
 rustle which just reached heysts ears the
 man in the boat raised his hands to be helped
 up on the jetty whispering

    i tried i am too weak i tumbled
 down

   wang was coming along the jetty slowly
 with intent straining eyes

    run back and bring a crowbar here
 theres one lying by the coal-heap heyst
 shouted to him

   the man standing in the boat sat down on
 the thwart behind him a horrible coughing
 laugh came through his swollen lips

   crowbar whats that for he mum-
 bled and suddenly his head dropped on his
 chest

 meantime heyst as if he had forgotten
 the boat was busy kicking hard at a large
 brass tap projecting above the planks to
 accommodate ships that came for coal and
 happened to need water as well a stream had
 been tapped in the interior and an iron pipe
 led along the jetty it terminated with a
 curved end almost exactly wffere the strangers
 boat had been driven between the piles but
 the tap was set fast

 hurry up heyst yelled to the china-

 man who was running with the crowbar in

 his hand

    heyst snatched it from him and obtaining
 a leverage against the string-piece wrung the
 stiff tap round with a mighty jerk

     if only that pipe hasnt got choked he
 muttered to himself

     it hadn t but it did not yield a strong gush
 as he expected the sound of a thin stream
 partly breaking on the gunwale of the boat
 and partly splashing alongside became at once
 audible it provoked a cry of inarticulate and
 savage joy

    heyst knelt on the string-piece and peered
 down the man who had spoken was already
 holding his open mouth under the bright
 trickle his face with closed eyes had an
 air of ecstasy water ran over his eyelids and
 over his nose gurgled down his throat flowed
 over his chin

    then some obstruction in the pipe gave
 way and a sudden thick jet broke on his face
 in a moment his shoulders were soaked the
 front of his coat inundated he streamed and
 dripped water ran into his pockets down his
 legs into his shoes but he had clutched the
 end of the pipe and hanging on with both
 hands swallowed spluttered choked snorted
 with the noises of a swimmer

    suddenly a curious dull roar reached heysts
 ears something hairy and black flew from
 under the jetty a disheveled head coming
 on like a cannon-ball took the man at the
 pipe in flank with such force as to tear his
 grip loose and fling him headlong into the
 stern-sheets he fell upon the folded legs of
 the man at the tiller who roused by the com-
 motion in the boat was sitting up silent
 rigid and very much like a corpse his eyes
 were but two black patches and his teeth
 glistened with a deaths-head grin between his
 retracted lips which were no thicker than
 blackish parchment glued over his gums

 from him heysts eyes wandered to the
 creature who had replaced the first man at the
 end oi the water-pipe enormous brown paws
 clutched it desperately the wild big head
 hung back and in a face covered with a wet
 mass of hair there gaped crookedly a wide
 mouth full of fangs the water filled it
 welled up in hoarse coughs ran down on each
 side of the jaws and down the hairy throat
 soaked the black pelt of the enormous chest
 which was naked under a torn check shirt
 and which heaved convulsively with a play of
 massive muscles carved in red mahogany

 as soon as the second man had recovered
 the breath knocked out of him by the apelike


munseys magazine

 monsters irresistible charge a scream of mad
 cursing issued from the stern-sheets with a
 rigid angular crooking of the elbow the man
 at the tiller put his hand back to his hip

  dont shoot him mr jones yelled the
second man  wait let me have that tiller
i will teach him to shove himself in front of
a caballero

  martin ricardo flourished the heavy piece
of wood leaped forward with astonishing
vigor and brought it down on pedros head
with a crash that resounded all over the quiet
sweep of black diamond bay

  a crimson patch appeared on the matted
hair red veins appeared in the water flowing
all over his face and it dripped in rosy drops
off his head but the man hung on not till
a second furious blow descended did the hairy
paws let go their grip and the squirming body
sink limply before it could touch the bottom
boards a tremendous kick in the ribs from
ricardos foot shifted it forward out of sight
whence came the noise of a heavy thud a clat-
ter of spars and a pitiful grunt

  ricardo stooped to look under the jetty
aha dog that will teach you to keep
back where you belong you murdering brute
you slaughtering savage you you infidel
you robler of churches next time i will rip
you open from neck to heel you carrion-eater
esclavol

  he straightened himself up

   i dont mean it really he remarked to
heyst whose steady eyes met his from above
he ran aft briskly  come along sir its
your turn i oughtnt to have drunk first in
truth i forgot myself a gentleman like you
will overlook that i know as he made
these apologies ricardo extended his hand
 let me steady you sir

  slowly mr jones unfolded himself in all
his slenderness rocked staggered and caught
ricardos shoulder ijis henchman assisted
him to the pipe which went on gushing a clear
stream of water sparkling exceedingly against
the black piles and the gloom under the jetty

   catch hold sir ricardo advised so-
licitously all right

  he stepped back and while mr jones
reveled in the abundance of water he ad-
dressed himself to heyst with a sort of justi-
ficatory speech the tone of which reflecting
his feelings partook of purring and spitting
he wanted to be propitiatory but he could
not help his native ferocity piercing through
the diplomatic envelope

  they had been thirty hours pulling that
brute of a boat he explained and they had

been more than forty hours without a drop of
water no that was not exact the night
before they had had the felicity of licking the
dew off the gunwales

  ricardo did not explain to heyst how it
happened at that precise moment he had
no explanation ready for the man on the
wharf who he guessed must be wondering
much more at the presence of his visitors than
at their plight

xxii

  the explanation lay in these two simple
facts-that the light winds and strong currents
of the java sea had drifted the boat about
until they partly lost their bearings and that
by some extraordinary mistake one of the two
jars put into the boat by schombergs man
contained salt water but of all this though
bursting with rage against the hotel-keeper
ricardo could not speak only his eyes flashed
fury now and then as he tried to put some
pathos into his tones while enlarging on his
partys sufferings

  pulling for thirty hours with eighteen-foot
oars and the sun ricardo relieved his feel-
ings by cursing the sun they had felt their
hearts and lungs shrivel within them and
then as if all that hadnt been trouble enough
he complained bitterly he had had to waste
his fainting strength by beating their servant
about the head with a stretcher the fool
wanted to drink salt water and wouldnt listen
to reason there was no stopping him other-
wise it was better to beat him into insensi-
bility than to have him go crazy in the boat
and be obliged to shoot him the prevent-
ive administered with enough force to brain
an elephant boasted ricardo had to be ap-
plied on two occasions-the second time all
but in sight of the jetty

   you have seen the beauty ricardo went
on expansively hiding his lack of some sort of
probable story under this loquacity  i had
to hammer him again from the spout-to open
afresh all the old broken spots on his head
you saw how hard i had to hit he has no
restraint no restraint at all if it wasnt that
he can be made useful in one way or another
i would just as soon have let the governor
shoot him

  he smiled up at heyst in his peculiar lip-
retracting manner and added by way of after-
thought 

   thats what will happen to him in the end
if he doesnt learn to restrain himself but
ive taught him to mind his manners for a
while anyhow
victory



  and again he addressed his quick grin up to
the man on the wharf his round eyes had
never left heysts face since he began to
deliver his account of the voyage

   so thats how he looks ricardo was say-
ing to himself

  he had not expected heyst to be like this
he had formed for himself a conception con-
taining the helpful suggestion of a vulnerable
point these solitary men were often tipplers
but no-this was not a drinking mans face
nor could he detect the weakness of alarm or
even the weakness of surprise on these fea-
tures in these steady eyes

   we were too far gone to climb out
ricardo wrent on  i heard you walking along
though i thought i shouted i tried to you
didnt hear me shout

  heyst made an almost imperceptible nega-
tive sign which the greedy eyes of ricardo-
greedy for all signs-did not miss

   throat too parched we didnt even care
to whisper to each other lately thirst chokes
one we might have died there under this
wharf before you found us

   i couldnt think where you had gone to
heyst was heard at last directly addressing
the newcomers from the sea  you were seen
as soon as you cleared that point

  we were seen ch grunted mr ricardo
 we pulled like machines-darent stop the
governor sat at the tiller but he couldnt
speak to us she drove in between the piles
till she hit something and we all tumbled off
the thwarts as if we had been drunk drunk
-ha ha too dry by george we fetched
in here with the very last of our strength and
no mistake another mile would have done
for us when i heard your footsteps above i
tried to get up and i fell down

   that was the first sound i heard said
heyst

  mr jones the front of his soiled white
tunic soaked and plastered against his breast-
bone staggered away from the water-pipe
steadying himself on ricardos shoulder he
drew a long breath raised his dripping head
and produced a smile of ghastly amiability
which was lost upon the thoughtful heyst

  behind his back the sun touching the water
was like a small disk of iron cooled to a dull
red glow ready to start rolling round the cir-
cular steel plate of the sea which under the
darkening sky looked more solid than the high
ridge of samburan more solid than the point
whose long outlined slope melted into its own
unfathomable shadow blurring the dim sheen
on the bay

  the forceful stream from the pipe broke
like shattered glass on the boats gunwale its
loud fitful and persistent splashing revealed
the depth of the worlds silence

    great notion to lead the water out here
pronounced ricardo appreciatively

   water was life he felt now as if he could
run a mile scale a ten-foot wall sing a song
only a few minutes ago he was next door to a
corpse done up unable to stand to lift a
hand unable to groan a drop of water had
done that miracle

   didnt you feel life itself running and
soaking into you sir he asked his principal
with deferential but rather forced vivacity

  without a word mr jones stepped off the
thwart and sat down in the stern-sheets

    isnt that man of yours bleeding to death
in the bows under there inquired heyst

   ricardo ceased his ecstasies over the life-
giving water and answ-ered in a tone of in-
nocence 

  he you may call him a man but his
hide is a jolly sight tougher than the toughest
alligator he ever skinned in the good old days
you dont know how much he can stand i do
we have tried him long time ago ola there
pedro pedro he yelled with a force of
lung testifying to the regenerative virtues of
water

  a weak  seiior  answered from under the
wharf

   what did i tell you  said ricardo tri-
umphantly  nothing can hurt him hes all
right but i say the boats getting swamped
cant you turn this water off before you sink
her under us shes half full already

  at a sign from heyst wang hammered at
the brass tap on the wharf then stood behind
number one crowbar in hand motionless as
before ricardo was perhaps not so certain
of pedros toughness as he affirmed-for he
stooped peering under the wharf then moved
forward out of sight

  the gush of water ceasing suddenly made
a silence which became complete when the
after-trickle stopped afar the sun wras re-
duced to a red spark glowing very low in the
breathless immensity of twilight purple
gleams lingered on the water all round the
boat the spectral figure in the stern-sheets
spoke in a languid tone

   that-er-companion-er-secretary of
mine is a queer chap i am afraid we arent
presenting ourselves in a very favorable light

  it was something which could not be an-
swered and heyst said nothing the other
went on


munseys magazine

   traveling as i do i find a man of his sort
extremely useful he has his little weaknesses
no doubt

   indeed heyst was provoked into speak-
ing  weakness of the arm is not one of
them neither is an exaggerated humanity as
far as i can judge

   defects of temper explained mr jones
from the stern-sheets

  the subject of this dialogue coming out
just then from under the wharf into the visible
part of the boat made himself heard in his
own defense in a voice full of life and with
nothing languid in his manner on the con-
trary it was brisk almost joyous

  he begged pardon for contradicting he
was never out of temper with  our pedro 
the fellow was a dago of immense strength
and of no understanding whatever this com-
bination made him dangerous and he had to
be treated accordingly in a manner which he
could understand reasoning was beyond him

   and so -ricardo addressed heyst with
animation- you mustnt be surprised if-

 i assure you heyst interrupted  that
my wonder at your arrival in your boat here
is so great that it leaves no room for minor
astonishment but hadnt you better land
thats the talk sir

  ricardo began to bustle about the boat
talking all the time finding himself unable
to  size up  this man he was inclined to
credit him with extraordinary powers of pene-
tration which it seemed to him would be
favored by silence also he feared some
pointblank question

  he had no ready-made story to tell he
and his patron had put off considering that
rather important detail too long for the last
two days the horrors of thirst coming on them
unexpectedly had prevented consultation
they had had to pull for dear life but the
man on the wharf were he in league with the
devil himself would pay for all their suffer-
ings thought ricardo with an unholy joy

  meantime splashing in the water which
covered the bottom boards ricardo congratu-
lated himself aloud on the luggage being out
of the way of the wet he had piled it up
forward he had roughly tied up pedros
head pedro really had nothing to grumble
about on the contrary the creature ought to
be mighty thankful to him ricardo for being
alive at all

   well now let me give you a leg up sir
he said cheerily to his motionless principal in
the stern-sheets  all our troubles are over
for a time anyhow aint it lucky to find a

white man on this island i would have just
as soon expected to meet an angel from
heaven-eh mr jones now then-ready
sir one two three up you go

  helped from below by ricardo and from
above by the man more unexpected than an
angel mr jones scrambled up and stood on
the wharf by the side of heyst he swayed
like a reed the night descending on sam-
buran turned into dense shadow the point of
laqd and the wharf itself and gave a dark
solidity to the unshimmering water extending
to the last faint trace of light away to the
west

  heyst stared at the guests whom the re-
nounced world had sent him thus at the end
of the day the only other vestige of light
left on earth lurked in the hollows of the thin
mans eyes they gleamed mobile and lan-
guidly evasive the eyelids fluttered

   you are feeling weak said heyst

   for a moment a little confessed the
other

  with loud panting ricardo scrambled on his
hands and knees upon the wharf energetic and
unaided he rose up at heysts elbow and
stamped his feet on the planks with a sharp
provocative double beat such as is heard
sometimes in fencing-schools before the ad-
versaries engage their foils

  not that the renegade seaman ricardo knew
anything of fencing what he called  shoot-
ing-irons  were his weapons or the still less
aristocratic knife such as was even then in-
geniously strapped to his leg he thought of
it at that moment a swift stooping motion
then on the recovery a ripping blow a shove
off the wharf and no noise except a splash in
the water that would scarcely disturb the si-
lence heyst would have no time for a cry
it would be quick and neat and immensely
in accord with ricardos humor

  but he repressed this gust of savagery the
job was not such a simple one this piece
had to be played to another tune and in much
slower time he returned to his note of talka-
tive simplicity

   aye and i too dont feel as strong as i
thought i was when the first drink set me up
great wonder-worker water is and to get it
right here on the spot it was heaven-hey
sir

  mr jones being directly addressed took up
his part in the concerted piece

   really when i saw a wharf on what might
have been an uninhabited island i couldnt
believe my eyes i doubted its existence i
thought it was a delusion till the boat actually
victory



drove between the piles as you see her lying

now

  while he was speaking faintly in a voicc
which did not seem to belong to the earth his
henchman in extremely loud and terrestrial
accents was fussing about their belongings in
the boat addressing himself to pedro

   come now-pass up the dunnage there
move yourself hombre or ill have to get
down again and give you a tap on those band-
ages of yours you growling bear you

  helped by the talkative ricardo pedro
scrambled up on the wharf where he remained
for some time on all fours swinging to and
fro his shaggy head tied up in white rags
then he got up clumsily like a bulky animal
in the dusk balancing itself on its hind legs

  mr jones began to explain languidly to
heyst that they were in a pretty bad state
that morning when they caught sight of the
smoke of the volcano it nerved them to make
an effort for their lives soon afterward they
made out the island

   i had just wit enough left in my baked
brain to alter the direction of the boat the
ghostly voice went on  as to finding assist-
ance here a wharf a white man-nobody
would have dreamed of such things simply
preposterous

   thats what i thought when my china-
man came and told me he had seen a boat
with white men pulling up said heyst

   most extraordinary luck interjected
ricardo standing by with anxious attention
to every word  seems a dream he added
a lovely dream

  a silence fell on that group of three as if
every one had become afraid to speak in an
obscure sense of an impending crisis a light
draft of air tepid enough in the thickening
twilight after the scorching day struck a chill
into mr jones in his soaked clothes

   i may infer then that there is a settle-
ment of white people here he murmured
shivering visibly

  heyst roused himself

  oh abandoned abandoned i am alone
here-practically alone but several empty
houses are still standing no lack of accom-
modation we may just as well-here wang
go back to the shore and run the trolley out
here

  the last words having been spoken in
malay he explained courteously that he had
given directions for the transport of the lug-
gage wang had melted into the night in his
soundless manner

  my word rails laid down and all ex-

claimed ricardo softly in a tone of admira-
tion  well i never

   we were working a coal-mine here said
the late manager of the tropical belt coal
company  these are only the ghosts of
things that have been

  mr joness teeth were suddenly started
chattering by another faint puff of wind a
mere sigh from the west when venus cast her
rays on the dark edge of the horizon like a
bright lamp hung above the grave of the sun

   we might be moving on proposed heyst
 the chinaman and that-ah-ungrateful
servant of yours with the broken head can
load the things and come along after us

  the suggestion was accepted without words
moving toward the shore the three men met
the trolley a mere metallic rustle which
whisked past them the shadowy wang run-
ning noiselessly behind

   i am prevented from offering you a share
of my own quarters said heyst the dis-
tant courtliness of this beginning arrested the
other two suddenly as if amazed by some
manifest incongruity  i should regret it
more he went on  if i were not in a posi-
tion to give you the choice of those empty
bungalows for a temporary home

  he turned round and plunged into the nar-
row track the two others following in single
file

  queer start ricardo took the oppor-
tunity for whispering as he fell behind mr
jones who swayed in the gloom enclosed by
the stalks of tropical grass almost as slender
as a stalk of grass himself

  in this order they emerged into the open
space kept clear of vegetation by wangs ju-
dicious system of periodic firing the shapes
of buildings unlighted high-roofed looked
mysteriously extensive and featureless against
the increasing glitter of the stars

  heyst was pleased at the absence of light
in his bungalow it looked as uninhabited as
the others he continued to lead the way in-
clining to the right his equable voice was
heard

   this one would be the best it was our
counting-house theres some furniture in it
yet i am pretty certain that youll find a
couple of camp bedsteads in one of the
rooms

  the high-pitched roof of the bungalow tow-
ered up very close eclipsing the sky

   here we are three steps as you see
theres a wide veranda sorry to keep you
waiting for a moment the door is locked i
think


munseys magazine

  he was heard trying it then he leaned
against the rail saying

   wang will get the keys

  the others waited two vague shapes nearly
mingled together in the darkness of the
veranda from which issued a sudden chatter-
ing of mr joness teeth directly suppressed
and a slight shuffle of ricardos feet their
guide and host his back against the rail
seemed to have forgotten their existence
suddenly he moved and murmured

  ah heres the trolley

  then he raised his voice in malay and was
answered ya tuan  from an indistinct group
that could be made out in the direction of the
track

   i have sent wang for the key and a
light he said in a voice that came out with-
out any particular direction-a peculiarity
which disconcerted ricardo

  wang did not tarry long on his mission
very soon from the distant recesses of ob-
scurity appeared the swinging lantern he car-
ried it cast a fugitive ray on the arrested
trolley with the uncouth figure of the wild
pedro drooping over the load then it moved
toward the bungalow and ascended the stairs

  after working at the stiff lock wang applied
his shoulder to the door it came open with
explosive suddenness as if in a passion at be-
ing thus disturbed after two years repose
from the dark slope ofa tall stand-up desk a
solitary sheet of paper flew up and settled
gracefully on the floor

  wang and pedro came and went through the
offended door bringing the things off the trol-
ley one flitting swiftly in and out the other
staggering heavily later directed by a few
quiet words from number one wang made
several journeys with the lantern to the store-
rooms bringing in blankets provisions in tins
coffee sugar and even a packet of candles
he lighted one of these last and stuck it on
the ledge of the stand-up desk

  meantime pedro being introduced to some
kindling-wood and a bundle of dry sticks had
busied himself outside in lighting a fire on
which he placed a ready-filled kettle handed
to him by wang impassively at arms length
as if across a chasm

  having received the thanks of his guests
heyst wished them good night and withdrew
leaving them to their repose

xxiii

  heyst walked away slowly there was still
no light in his bungalow and he thought that
perhaps it was just as well

  by this time he was much less perturbed
he had seen many different kinds of men and
was familiar with a great variety of manner
and conduct the only peculiarity which ar-
rested his thoughts unpleasantly was a sort of
underhand elation in ricardos bustling man-
ner eut he was not thinking much of these
strangers his thoughts had been with lena
almost all the time

  wang had preceded him with the lantern as
if in a hurry to get away from the two white
men and their hairy attendant the light was
not dancing along any more it was standing
perfectly still by the steps of the veranda

  heyst glancing back casually saw behind
him still another light-the light of the
strangers open fire a black uncouth form
stooping over it monstrously staggered away
into the outlying shadows the kettle had
boiled probably

  with that weird vision of something ques-
tionably human impressed upon his senses
heyst moved on a pace or two what could
the people be who had such a creature for
their familiar attendant

  he stopped he had felt a blow struck
within his breast an inward and arresting
shock the consciousness of fears and hopes
outside of himself and bound up with his
actions the vague apprehension of a distant
future in which he saw lena unavoidably sep-
arated from him by profound and subtle dif-
ferences was now replaced by the immediate
concern of responsibility for the girls safety
that skeptical carelessness which had accom-
panied every one of his attempts at action
like a secret reserve of his soul fell away
from him he no longer belonged to himself
alone there was a call far more imperious
and august

  he came up to the bungalow and was on
the point of calling her by name when at the
very limit of the lanterns light on the top
step he saw her feet and the bottom part of
her dress the rest of her person wfas sug-
gested dimly as high as her waist she sat on
a chair and the gloom of the low eaves de-
scended upon her head and shoulders she
didnt stir

   you havent gone to sleep here he asked

  oh no i was waiting for you-in the

dark

  heyst on the top step leaned against a
wooden pillar after moving the lantern to one

side

   i have been thinking that it is just as well
you had no light but wasnt it dull for you

to sit in the dark
victory



   i dont need a light to think of you she
said simply

  her charming voice gave a value to the
banal answer which had also the merit of
truth heyst laughed a little and said that
he had had a curious experience she made no
remark

  he tried to figure to himself the outlines
of her easy pose a spot of dim light here
and there hinted at the unfailing grace of at-
titude which was one of the girls natural
possessions

  she had thought of him but not in con-
nection with the strangers she had admired
him from the first she had been attracted
by his warm voice his gentle eye but she had
felt him too wonderfully difficult to know he
had given to life a savor a movement a prom-
ise mingled with menace which she had not
suspected were to be found in it-or at any
rate not by a girl wedded to misery as she
was she said to herself that she must not be
irritated because he seemed loo self-contained
and as if shut up in a world of his own

  when he took her in his arms she felt that
his embrace had a great and compelling force
that he was moved deeply and that perhaps
he would not get tired of her so very soon
she thought that he had opened to her the
feelings of delicate joy that the very uneasi-
ness he caused her was delicious in its sadness
and that she would try to hold him as long as
she could-till her fainting arms her sinking
soul could cling to him no more

  wangs not here of course heyst said
suddenly

  she answered as if in her sleep

   he put this light down here without stop-
ping and ran

  ran did he h-m well its considera-
bly later than his usual time to go home to
his alfuro wife but to be seen running is a
sort of degradation for wang who has mas-
tered the art of vanishing do you think he
was startled out of his perfection by some-
thing

   why should he be startled

  her voice remained dreamy a little uncer-
tain

   i have been startled heyst said

  she was not listening to him the lantern
at their feet threw the shadows of her face
upward her eyes glistened as if frightened
and attentive above a lighted chin and a very
white throat

   upon my word mused heyst  now that
i dont see them i can hardly believe that
those fellows exist

   and what about me she asked so swift-
ly that he made a backward movement like
somebody pounced upon from an ambush
 when you dont see me do you believe that
i really exist

 exist most charmingly my dear
lena you dont know your own advantages
why your voice alone would be enough to
make you unforgetable

   oh i didnt mean forgetting in that way
i dare say if i were to die you would remem-
ber me right enough and what good would
that be to anybody its while i am alive that
i want-

  a heavy spoke of shadow from the frame of
the lantern lay between them broadening out
into the night on the farther end of the
veranda-a ray of darkness cutting in two the
plane of light at their feet heyst strode over
it and stooping kissed her eyes which she
had closed when he moved she did not open
them she remained inert but the man felt
subtly that within her she was responsive to
his caress

  for a moment he stood by her chair-a
stalwart figure imperfectly lighted the broad
shoulders the martial face that was like a
disguise of his disarmed soul were lost in the
gloom above the plane of light in which his
feet were planted he glanced along the
veranda in the direction of the other bunga-
low the fire of sticks in front of it had gone
out no faint glow of embers not the slight-
est thread of light in that direction hinted at
the presence of strangers the darker shapes
in the obscurity the dead silence betrayed
nothing of that strange intrusion

  the peace of samburan asserted itself as
on any other night everything was as be-
fore except-heyst became aware of it sud-
denly-that for a whole minute perhaps with
his hand on the back of the girls chair and
within a foot of her person he had lost the
sense of her existence for the first time since
he had brought her over to share that invinci-
ble that undefiled peace

  he picked up the lantern and this act made
a silent stir all along the veranda a spoke
of shadow swung swiftly across her face and
the strong light rested on the stillness of her
features as of a woman looking at a vision
her eyes were very wide open her lips serious
her dress open at the neck stirred slightly to
her even breathing

   we had better go in lena said heyst
very low as if breaking a spell cautiously

  she rose without a word heyst followed
her indoors as they passed through the liv-


munseys magazine

  ing-room he left the lantern burning on the
  center-table

xxiv

   that night the girl woke up for the first
  time in her new experience with the sensation
  of having been abandoned to her own devices
  she woke up from a painful dream of separa-
  tion brought about in a way which she could
  not understand and missed the relief of the
  waking instant the desolate feeling of being
  alone persisted

  she was really alone a night-light made it
  plain enough in the dim mysterious manner
  of a dream but this was reality it startled
  her exceedingly

  in a moment she was at the curtain that
  hung in the doorway and raised it with a
  steady hand the conditions of their life in
  samburan would have made peeping absurd
  nor was such a thing in her character this
  was not a movement of curiosity but of down-
  right alarm-the continued distress and fear
  of the dream

  the night could not have been very far ad-
  vanced the light in the lantern was burning
  strongly yet striping the floor and the walls of
  the room with thick black bands she hardly
  knew whether she expected to see heyst or
  not but she saw him at once standing bv the
  table in his sleeping-suit his back to the door-
  way

  she stepped in noiselessly with her bare feet
  and let the curtain fall behind her something
  characteristic in heysts attitude made her
  say almost in a whisper

   you are looking for something

  he could not have heard her before but he
  didn t start at the unexpected whisper he
  only pushed the drawer of the table in and
  without even looking over his shoulder asked
  quietly accepting her presence as if he had
  been aware of all her movements

   i say are you certain that wang didnt go
  through this room this evening

 wang when

   after leaving the lantern i mean

   oh no he ran on i watched him

   or before perhaps-while i was with
jboat people do you know can you

  i hardly think so i came out as the sun
went down and sat outside till you came back
to me

  he could have popped in for an instant
through the back veranda

   i heard nothing in here she said  what
is the matter

 naturally you wouldnt hear he can be
as quiet as a shadow when he likes i believe
he could steal the pillows from under our

heads he might have been here ten minutes

 ago

	what woke you up was it a noise
cant say that generally one cant tell 
but is it likely lena you are i believe the
lighter sleeper of us two a noise loud enough
to wake me up would have awakened you too
i tried to be as quiet as i could what roused
you

 i dont know-a dream perhaps i woke
up crying

 what was the dream

heyst with one hand resting on the table
had turned in her direction his round close-
croppe head set on a fighters muscular neck
she left his question unanswered as if she had
not heard it

  what is it you have missed she asked
in her turn very grave

her dark hair drawn smoothly back was
done in two thick tresses for the night heyst
noticed the good form of her forehead the
dignity of its width its unshining whiteness
it was a sculptural forehead he had a mo-
ment of acute appreciation intruding upon an-
other order of thoughts it was as if there
could be no end of his discoveries about that
girl at the most incongruous moments

she had on nothing but a hand-woven cot-
ton sarong-one of heysts few purchases
years ago in celebes where they are made
he had forgotten all about it till she came
and then had found it in the bottom of an old
sandalwood trunk dating back to pre-morri-
son days she had quickly learned to wind it
up under her armpits with a safe twist as
malay village girls do when going down to
bathe m a river

her shoulders and arms were bare one of
her tresses hanging forward looked almost
black against the white skin as she was
taller than the average malay woman the
sarong ended a good way above her ankles
she stood poised firmly like a statue half-
way between the table and the curtained door-
way the insteps of her bare feet gleaming like
marble on the overshadowed matting of the
floor

 the fall of her lighted shoulders the strong
 and fine attachment of her arms hanging down
 her sides her immobility too had something
 statuesque the charm of art tense with life

she was not very big-heyst used to think of
her at first as  that poor little girl but re
vealed free from the shabby banality of a
victory



 white platform dress in the simple drapery
 of the sarong there was that in her form and
 in the proportions of her body which suggested
 a reduction from a heroic size

   she moved forward a step

    what is it you have missed she asked
 again

   heyst turned his back altogether on the
 table the black spokes of darkness over the
 floor and the walls joining up on the ceiling
 in a patch of shadow were like the bars of a
 cage about them it was his turn to ignore
 a question

    you woke up in a fright he said

   she walked up to him exotic yet familiar
 with her white womans face and shoulders
 above the malay sarong as if it were an airy
 disguise but her expression was serious

     no she replied  it was distress rather
 you see you werent there and i couldnt tell
 why you had gone away from me a nasty
 dream-the first ive had too since-

    you dont believe in dreams do you
 asked heyst

    i once knew a woman who did least-
 wise she used to tell people what dreams
 meant for a shilling

    would you go now and ask her what this
 dream means inquired heyst jocularly

    she lived in camberwell she was a nasty
 old thing

   heyst laughed a little uneasily

    dreams are madness my dear its things
 that happen in the waking world while one is
 asleep that one would be glad to know the
 meaning of

    you have missed something out of this
 drawer she said positively

    this or some other i have looked into
 every single one of them and came back to this
 again as people do its difficult to believe the
 evidence of my own senses but it isnt there
 now lena are you sure that you didnt-

  i have touched nothing in the house but
 what you have given me

  lena  he cried

 he was painfully affected by this disclaimer
 of a charge which he had not made it was
 what a servant might have said-an inferior
 open to suspicion-or at any rate a stranger
 he was angry at being so wretchedly misun-
 derstood disenchanted at her not being in-
 stinctively aware of the place he had secretly
 given her in his thoughts

  after all he said to himself  we are
 strangers to each other

 and then he felt sorry for her he spoke
 calmly

     i was about to say are you sure you have
no reason to think that the chinaman has
been in this room to-night

   you suspect him she asked knitting her
eyebrows

    there is no one else to suspect you may
call it a certitude

     ou don t want to tell me what it is
she inquired in the equable tone in which one
takes a fact into account

   heyst only smiled faintly

    nothing very precious as far as value
goes he replied

    i thought it might have been monev she
said

   money exclaimed heyst as if the sug-
gestion had been altogether preposterous she
was so visibly surprised that he hastened to
add  of course there is some money in the
house-there in that writing-desk the drawer
on the leit it s not locked you can pull it
right out there is a recess and the board at
the back pivots a very simple hiding-place
when you know the way to it i discovered it
bv accident and i keep our store of sovereigns
in there the treasure my dear is not big
enough to require a cavern

   he paused laughed very low and returned
her steady stare

    the loose silver some guilders and dol-
lars i have always kept in that unlocked left
drawer i have no doubt wang knows what
there is in it but he isnt a thief and thats
why i- no lena what ive missed is not
gold or jewels and thats what makes the fact
interesting -which a mere theft of monev
cannot be

   she took a long breath relieved to hear
that it was not money a great curiosity was
depicted on her face but she refrained from
pressing him with questions she only gave
him one of her deep-gleaming smiles

    it isnt me so it must be wang you
ought to make him give it back to you

   heyst said nothing to that naive and prac-
tical suggestion

xxv

   the object that heyst missed from the
drawer was his revolver

   it was a heavy weapon which he had owned
for many years and had never used in his life
ever since the london furniture had arrived
in samburan it had been reposing in the
drawer of the table the real dangers of life
for him were not those which could be re-
pelled by swords or bullets on the other
hand neither his manner nor his appearance


munseys

magazine

 looked sufficiently inoffensive to expose him to
 light-minded aggression

  he could not have explained what had in-
duced him to go to the drawer in the middle
of the night he had started up suddenly-
which was very unusual with him he had
found himself sitting up and extremely wide
awake all at once with the girl reposing by
his side lying with her face away from him
a vague characteristically feminine form in
the dim light she was perfectly still

  at that season of the year there were no
mosquitoes in samburan and the sides of the
mosquito-net were looped up heyst swung
his feet to the floor and found himself stand-
ing there almost before he had become aware
of his intention to get up why he did this he
did not know he didnt wish to wake her
up and the slight creak of the broad bedstead
had sounded very loud to him he turned
round apprehensively and wailed for her to
move but she did not stir

  while he looked at her he had a vision of
himself lying there too also fast asleep and
-it occurred to him for the first time in his
life-very defenseless this quite novel im-
pression of the dangers of slumber made him
think suddenly of his revolver he left the
bedroom with noiseless footsteps the light-
ness of the curtain he had to lift as he passed
out and the outer door wide open on the
blackness of the veranda-for the roof eaves
came down low shutting out the starlight-
gave him a sense of having been dangerously
exposed he could not have said to what

  he pulled the drawer open its emptiness
cut his train of self-communion short he
murmured to the assertive fact

  impossible somewhere else

  he tried to remember where he had put the
thing but those provoked whispers of memory
were not encouraging foraging in every re-
ceptacle and nook big enough to contain a
revolver he came to the conclusion that it was
not in that room neither was it in the other

  the whole bungalow consisted of the two
rooms and a profuse allowance of veranda all
round heyst stepped out on the veranda

   its wang beyond a doubt he thought
staring into the night he has got hold of
it for some reason

  there was nothing to prevent that ghostly
chinaman from materializing suddenly at the
foot of the stairs or anywhere at any mo-
ment and toppling him over with a dead-sure
shot the danger was so irremediable that it
was not worth worrying about any more than
the general precariousness of human life

  heyst speculated on this added risk how
long had he been at the mercy of a slender
yellow finger on the trigger that is if that
was the fellows reason for purloining the re-
volver

   shoot and inherit thought heyst  very
simple

  yet there was in his mind a marked re-
luctance to regard the domesticated grower of
vegetables in the light of a murderer

   no it wasnt that for wang could have
done it any time these last twelve months or
more

  heysts mind had worked on the assumption
that wang had possessed himself of the re-
volver during his own absence from sam-
buran but at that period of his speculation
his point of view changed it struck him with
the force of manifest certitude that the revol-
ver had been taken only late in the day or on
that very night wang of course but why

  so there had been no danger in the past
it was all ahead

  he has me at his mercy now thought
heyst without particular excitement

  the sentiment he experienced was curiosity
he forgot himself in it it was as if he were
considering somebody elses strange predica-
ment but even that sort of interest was
dying out when looking at his left he saw the
accustomed shapes of the other bungalows
looming in the night and remembered the ar-
rival of the thirsty company in the boat
wang would hardly risk such a crime in the
presence of other white men it was a pe-
culiar instance of the safety in numbers
principle which somehow was not much to
heysts taste

  he went in gloomily and stood over the
empty drawer in deep and unsatisfactory
thought he had just made up his mind that
he must breathe nothing of this to the girl
when he heard her voice behind him she
had taken him by surprise but he resisted the
impulse to turn round under the impression
that she might read his trouble in his face

  yes she had taken him by surprise and for
that reason the conversation which began was
not exactly as he would have conducted it if
he had been prepared for her pointblank ques-
tion he ought to have said at once  ive
missed nothing it was a deplorable thing
that he should have let it come so far as to
have her ask what it was he missed

  he closed the conversation by saying
lightly

   its an object of very small value dont
worry about it-it isnt worth while the best
victory



you can do is to go and lie down again
lena

  reluctantly she turned away and only in
the doorway asked

   and you

  i think i shall smoke a cheroot on the
veranda i dont feel sleepy for the moment

   well dont be long

  he made no answer she saw him standing
there very still with a frown on his brow and
slowly dropped the curtain

  heyst did really light a cheroot before going
out again on the veranda he glanced up from
under the low eaves to see by the stars how
the night went on it was going very slowly
why it should have irked him he did not
know for he had nothing to expect from the
dawn but everything round him had become
unreasonable unsettled and vaguely urgent
laying him under an obligation but giving him
no line of action

  he felt contemptuously irritated with the
situation the outer world had broken upon
him and he did not know what wrong he had
done to bring this on himself any more than
he knew what he had done to provoke the
horrible calumny about his treatment of poor
morrison

  for he could not forget this it had
reached the ears of one who needed to have
the most perfect confidence in the authority
of his conduct

   and she only half disbelieves it he
thought with hopeless humiliation

  this moral stab in the back seemed to rave
taken some of his strength from him as a
physical wound would have done he had no
desire to do anything-neither to bring wang
to terms in the matter of the revolver nor to
find out from the strangers who they were
and how their predicament had come about

  he flung his glowing cigar away into the
night but samburan was no longer a soli-
tude wherein he could indulge all his moods
the fiery parabolic trail the cast-out stump
traced in the air was seen from another veran-
da at a distance of some twenty yards it
was noted as a symptom of importance by an
observer with his faculties greedy for signs
and in a state of alertness tense enough al-
most to hear the grass grow

xxvi

 the observer was martin ricardo to
him life was not a matter of passive renuncia-
tion but of a particularly active warfare he
was not mistrustful of it he was not dis-
gusted with it still less was he inclined to be

suspicious of its disenchantments but he was
vividly aware that it held many possibilities
of failure though very far from being a pes-
simist he was not a man of foolish illusions

  he did not like failure not only because of
its unpleasant and dangerous consequences
but also because of its damaging effect upon
his own appreciation of martin ricardo and
this was a special job of his own contriving
and of considerable novelty it was not so
to speak in his usual line of business-except
perhaps from a moral standpoint about which
he was not likely to trouble his head for
these reasons martin ricardo was unable to
sleep

  mr jones after repeated shivering fits and
after drinking much hot tea had apparently
fallen into deep slumber he had very per-
emptorily discouraged attempts at conversa-
tion on the part of his faithful follower

  ricardo listened to his regular breathing
it was all very well for the governor he
looked upon it as a sort of sport a gentle-
man naturally would but this ticklish and
important job had to be pulled off at all costs
both for honor and for safety

  ricardo arose quietly and made his way on
the veranda he could not lie still he want-
ed to go out for air and he had a feeling that
by the force of his eagerness even the dark-
ness and the silence could be made to yield
something to his eyes and ears

  he noted the stars and stepped back again
into the dense darkness it comforted him
it was impenetrable he was hidden in it as
if in ambush he stood erect against the wall
confident that no one in the open could see
that he was there he strained his eyes and
his ears but the darkness and the silence
would give no sign

  he resisted the growing impulse to go out
and steal toward the other bungalow it would
have been madness to go prowling in the dark
on unknown ground and for what end he
kept his objectless vigil though convinced that
he would neither hear nor see anything the
man of the island was keeping quiet

  it was at that moment that ricardos eyes
caught the vanishing red trail of light made
by the cigar - a startling revelation of the
other mans wakefulness he could not sup-
press a low  hello and began to sidle along
toward the door with his shoulders rubbing
the wall for all he knew the other man
might have been out in front by this time
observing the veranda

  as a matter of fact after flinging away the
cheroot heyst had gone in with the feeling


munseys magazine

of a man who gives up an unprofitable occu-
pation but ricardo fancied he could hear
faint footfalls on the open ground being
close to the door he quietly dodged into the
room there he drew breath and meditated
in the dark for a while

  his next step was to feel for the matches
on the tall desk and to light the candle he
had to communicate to his governor views and
reflections of such importance that it was ab-
solutely necessary for him to watch their
effect on the very countenance of the hearer
at first he had thought that these matters
could have waited till daylight but the other
mans wakefulness disclosed in that startling
way made him feel suddenly certain that
there could be no sleep for him that night

  he said as much to his governor when the
little daggerlike flame had done its best to
dispel the darkness mr jones was dimly to
be seen reposing on a camp bedstead in a dis-
tant part of the room a railway rug con-
cealed his spare form up to his very head
which lay on the other railway rug rolled up
for a pillow

  ricardo plumped himself down cross-legged
on the floor very close to the low bedstead
so that mr jones-who perhaps had not been
so very profoundly asleep-on opening his eyes
found them conveniently leveled at the face
of his secretary

  eh what is it you say no sleep for
you to-night but why cant you let me
sleep confound your fussiness

   because that there fellow cant sleep-
thats why dash me if he hasnt been doing
a think just now what business has he to
think in the middle of the night

   howr do you know

   he was out sir-up in the middle of the
night my own eyes saw it

   but how do you know that he was up to
think inquired mr jones it might have
been anything-toothache for instance and
you may have dreamed it for all i know
didnt you try to sleep

   no sir i didnt even try to go to sleep
ricardo informed his patron of his vigil on
the veranda and of the revelation which put
an end to it he concluded that a man up
wjth a cigar in the middle of the night must
be doing a think

  mr jones had raised himself on his elbow
this sign of interest comforted his faithful
henchman

   seems to me its time we did a little think
ourselves added ricardo with more as-
surance

   you are always making a fuss remarked
mr jones in a tolerant tone

   aye but not for nothing am i you
cant say that sir mine may not be a gentle-
mans way of looking round a thing but it
isnt a fools way either youve admitted-
that much yourself at odd times

  ricardo was growing warmly argumenta-
tive mr jones interrupted him without heat

   you havent roused me to talk about
yourself i presume

   no sir ricardo remained silent for a
minute with the tip of his tongue peeping be-
tween his lips  i dont think i could tell
you anything about myself that you dont
know he continued there was a sort of
amused satisfaction in his tone which changed
completely as he went on its that man
over there thats got to be talked over i
dont like him

  he failed to observe the flicker of a ghastly
smile on his governors lips

   dont you murmured mr jones whose
face as he reclined on his elbow was on a
level with the top of his followers head

   no sir said ricardo emphatically the
candle from the other side of the room threw
his monstrous black shadow on the wall  he
-i dont know how to say it-he isnt hearty
like

  mr jones agreed languidly in his own
manner

   he seems to be a very self-possessed
man

   aye thats it self- ricardo choked
with indignation  i would soon let out some
f his self-possession through a hole between
his ribs if this werent a special job

  mr jones had been making his own reflec-
tions for he asked

   do you think he is suspicious

   i dont see very wrell what he can be sus-
picious of pondered ricardo  yet there
he was doing a think and what could be
the object of it wtiat made him get out of
his bed in the middle of the night taint
fleas surely

   bad conscience perhaps suggested mr
jones jocularly

  his faithful secretary suffered from irrita-
tion and did not see the joke in a fretful
tone he declared that there was no such thing
as conscience there was such a thing as
funk but there was nothing to make that
fellow funky in any special way he admit-
ted however that the man might have been
uneasy at the arrival of strangers because of
all that plunder of his put away somewhere
victory



  ricardo glanced here and there as if he
were afraid of being overheard by the heavy
shadows that the dim light cast all over the
room his patron very quiet but without
any assumption of nonchalance spoke in a
calm whisper

   and perhaps that hotel-keeper has been
lying to you about him he may be a very
poor devil indeed

  ricardo shook his head slightly the
schombergian theory of heyst had become in
him a profound conviction which he had ab-
sorbed as naturally as a sponge takes up water
his patrons doubts outraged him as a wanton
denying of what is self-evident but his voice
remained as before a soft purring with a
snarling undertone

  i am sup-prised at you sir its the very
way them tame ones-the common yporcrites
of the world-get on when it comes to
plunder drifting under ones very nose theres
not one of them that would keep his hands
off it and i dont blame them its the
way they do it that sets my back up just
look at the story of how he got rid of that
pal of his send a man home to croak of a
cold on the chest-thats one of your tame
tricks and dyou mean to say sir that a
man thats up to it wouldnt bag whatever he
could lay his hands on in his yporcritical
way what was all that coal business tame
citizen dodge yporcrisy-nothing else no
no sir the thing is to extract it from him
as neatly as possible thats the job and it
isnt so simple as it looks i reckon you have
looked at it all round sir before you took up
the notion of this trip

   no mr jones was hardly audible star-
ing far away from his couch  i didnt think
about it much i was bored

   aye that you were-bad i was feeling
pretty desperate that afternoon when that
bearded softy of a landlord got talking to me
about this fellow here quite accidentally it
was well sir here we are after a mighty
narrow squeak i feel all limp yet but never
mind-his swag will pay for the lot

   hes all alone here remarked mr jones
in a hollow murmur

   ye-es in a way yes alone enough yes
you may say he is

   theres that chinaman though

   aye theres the chink assented ricardo
rather absent-mindedly

he was debating in his mind the advisabili-
ty of making a clean breast of his knowledge
of the girls existence finally he concluded
he wouldnt the enterprise was difficult


enough without complicating it with an upset
to the sensibilities of the gentleman with
whom he had the honor of being associated
let the discovery come of itself he thought
and then he could swear that he had known
nothing of that offensive presence

  he did not need to lie he had only to
hold his tongue

   yes he muttered reflectively  theres
that chink certainly

  at bottom he felt a certain ambiguous
respect for his governors exaggerated dislike
of women he did not pretend to understand
it all he knew was that he himself was dif-
ferently inclined and that it did not make
him any happier or safer

  foreseeing many difficulties of a material
order mr joness henchman decided to keep
the girl out of the governors knowledge out
of his sight too for as long a time as it
could be managed that alas seemed to be
at most a matter of a few hours whereas
ricardo feared that to get the affair properly
going would take some time once well start-
ed he was not afraid of his gentleman failing
him as is often the case with lawless na-
tures ricardos faith in any given individual
was of a simple unquestioning character for
man must have some support in life

  cross-legged his head drooping a little and
perfectly still he might have been meditating
in a bronzelike attitude upon the sacred syl-
lable  om it was a striking illustration of
the untruth of appearances for his contempt
for the world was of a severely practical kind
there was nothing oriental about ricardo but
the amazing quietness of his pose

  mr jones was also very quiet he had let
his head sink on the rolled-up rug and lay
stretched out on his side with his back to the
light in that position the shadows gathered
in the cavities of his eyes made them look
perfectly empty when he spoke his ghostly
voice had only to travel a few inches straight
into ricardos left ear

   why dont you say something now that
youve got me awake

   i wonder if you were sleeping as sound as
you are trying to make out sir said the un-
moved ricardo

   i wonder repeated mr jones  at any
rate i was resting quietly

  come sir ricardos whisper was
alarmed  you dont mean to say youre go-
ing to be bored

   no

   quite right  the secretary was very
much relieved  theres no occasion to be


munseys magazine

i can tell you sir he whispered earnestly
 anything but that if i didnt say any-
thing for a bit it aint because there isnt
plenty to talk about aye more than enough

   whats the matter breathed out his
patron are you going to turn pessimist
 me turn no sir i aint of those that
turn you may call me hard names if you
like but you know very well that i aint a
croaker ricardo changed his tone  if i
said nothing for a while it was because i was
meditating over the chink sir

  you were waste of time my martin
a chinaman is unfathomable

  ricardo admitted that this might be so
anyhow a chink was neither here nor there
as a general thing unfathomable as he could
be but a swedish baron wasnt-couldnt be
the woods were full of such barons

   i dont know that he is so tame was
mr joness remark in a sepulchral undertone

   how do you mean sir he aint a rabbit
of course you couldnt hyptonize him as i
saw you do to more than one dago and other
kinds of tame citizens when it came to the
point of holding them down to a game

   dont you reckon on that murmured
plain mr jones seriously

  no sir i dont though you have a won-
derful power of the eye its a fact

   i have a wonderful patience remarked
mr jones

  a dim smile flitted over the lips of the
faithful ricardo who never raised his head

  i dont want to try you too much sir
but this is like no other job we ever turned
our minds to

   perhaps not at any rate let us think
so

  a weariness with the monotony of life was
reflected in the tone of this qualified assent
it jarred on the nerves of the sanguine ri-
cardo

   let us think of the way to go to work
he retorted a little impatiently  hes a deep
one just look at the way he treated that
chum of his did you ever hear of anything
so low and the artfulness of the beast-
the dirty tame artfulness

   dont you start moralizing martin said
mr jones warningly  as far as i can make
out the story that german hotel-keeper told
you it seems to show a certain amount of
character an independence from common
feelings which is not usual its very remark-
able if true

   aye aye very remarkable its mighty
low down all the same muttered ricardo

obstinately  i must say i am glad to think
he will be paid off for it in a way that 
surprise him

  the tip of his tongue appeared lively for an
instant as if trying for the taste of that
ferocious retribution on his compressed lips
for ricardo was sincefe in his indignation be-
fore the elementary principle of loyalty to a
chum violated in cold blood slowly in a pa-
tient duplicity of years

   aye hes deep-hes artful he mumbled
between his sharp teeth

  confound you joness calm whisper
crept into his ear  come to the point
obedient the secretary shook off his
thoughtfulness there was a similarity of
mind between these two-one the outcast of
his vices the other inspired by a spirit of
scornful defiance the aggressiveness of a
beast of prey looking upon all the tame crea-
tures of the earth as its natural victims both
were astute enough however and both were
aware that they had plunged into this adven-
ture without a sufficient scrutiny of detail

  the feeling voiced by the henchman in his
own way- we dont seem much forwarder
now we are here -was acknowledged by the
silence of the patron it was easy enough to
rip a fellow up or drill a hole in him whether
he was alone or not ricardo reflected in low
confidential tones but-

   he isnt alone mr jones said faintly in
his attitude of a man composed for sleep
 dont forget that chinaman

  ricardo started slightly

  oh aye-the chink

  ricardo had been on the point of confessing
about the girl but no he wanted his gov-
ernor to be unperturbed and steady vague
thoughts which he hardly dared to look in the
face were stirring in his brain in connection
with that girl she couldnt be much account
he thought she could be frightened and
there were also other possibilities the chink
however could and ought to be considered

   what i was thinking about it sir he
went on earnestly  is this-here weve got a
man hes nothing if he wont be good
he can be made quiet thats easy but then
theres his plunder he doesnt carry it in
his pocket

   i hope not breathed mr jones

  same here its too big you know but
if he were alone he would not feel worried
about it overmuch-i mean the safety of the
pieces he would just put the lot into any
box or drawer that was handy

   would he

of a hole in his bungalow argued ricardo
with real anxiety

  no a house can be burned-set on fire
accidentally or on purpose while a mans
asleep under the house-or in some crack
cranny or crevice something told him it
wasnt that the anguish of mental effort
contracted ricardos brow the skin of his
head seemed to move in this travail of vain
and tormenting suppositions

  what did you think a fellow is sir-a
baby he said in answer to mr joness ob-
jections  i am trying to find out what i
would do myself he wouldnt be likely to be
cleverer than i am

  and what do you know about yourself
mr jones seemed to watch his followers
perplexities with amusement concealed in a
deathlike composure

  ricardo disregarded the question the ma-
terial vision of the spoil absorbed all his
faculties a great vision he seemed to see
it a few small canvas bags tied up with thin
cord their distended rotundity showing the
inside pressure of the disklike forms of coins
-gold solid heavy eminently portable per-
haps steel cash-boxes with a chased design on
the covers or perhaps a black and brass box
with a handle on the top and full of goodness
knows what bank-notes whynot the
lellow had been going home so it was surely
something worth going home with

   and he may have put it anywhere outside
-anywhere cried ricardo in a deadened
voice  in the forest-

  that was it a temporary darkness re-
placed the dim light of the room the dark-
ness of the forest at night and in it the gleam
of a lantern by which a figure is digging at
the foot of a tree-trunk as likely as not an-
other figure holding that lantern-ha femi-
nine the girl

  the prudent ricardo stifled a picturesque
and profane exclamation partly joy partly
dismay had the girl been trusted or mis-
trusted by that man whatever it was it was
bound to be wholly with women there
could be no half-measures he could not
imagine a fellow half-trusting a woman in that
relation to himself and in those particular
circumstances of conquest and loneliness

  in nine cases out of ten the woman would
be trusted but trusted or mistrusted was
her presence a favorable or unfavorable con-
dition of the problem that was the question

   the temptation to consult his chief to talk
over the weighty fact and get his opinion on
it was great indeed ricardo resisted it but

the agony of his solitary mental conflict wa
extremely sharp a woman in a problem is
an incalculable quantity even if you have
something to go upon in forming your guess
how much more so when you havent even
once caught sight of her

   swift as were his mental processes he felt
 that a longer silence was inadvisable he
 hastened to speak

    and do you see sir you and i with a
couple of spades having to tackle this whole
confounded island

   he allowed himself a slight movement of
the arm the shadow enlarged it into a
sweeping gesture

    this seems rather discouraging martin
murmured the unmoved governor

   we mustnt be discouraged-thats all
retorted his henchman  somethings sure to
turn up to give us a hint only this job cant
be rushed you may depend on me to pick
up the least little bit of a hint but you sir-
youve got to play him very gently for the
rest you can trust me

    yes but i ask myself what you are trust-
 ing to

   our luck said the faithful ricardo
 dont say a word against that it might
spoil the run of it

    you are a superstitious beggar no i
wont say anything against it

   thats right sir dont you even think
lightly of it lucks not to be played with

    yes lucks a delicate thing assented mr
 jones in a dreamy whisper

   a short silence ensued which ricardo ended
 in a discreet and tentative voice

    talking of luck i suppose he could be
made to take a hand with you sir-two-hand-
ed picket or ekkarty you being seedy and
keeping indoors-just to pass the time for
all we know he may be one of them hot ones
once they start-

   is it likely came coldly from the prin-
cipal considering what we know of his
history-say with his partner 

   true sir hes a cold-blooded beast a
cold-blooded inhuman-

    and  tell you another thing that isnt
 likely he would not be likely to let himself
 be stripped bare we havent to do with a
 young fool that can be led on by chaff or
 flattery and in the end simply overawed
 this is a calculating man

ricardo recognized that clearly what he
had in his mind was something on a small
scale just to keep the enemy busy while he
ricardo had time to nose around a bit
n

victory

   you could even lose a little money to him
  sir he suggested

   i could

 ricardo was thoughtful for a moment

   he strikes me too as the sort of man to
  start prancing when one didnt expect it
  what do you think sir is he a man that
  would prance more likely to prance than to
  run-what

 the answer came at once because mr
 jones understood the peculiar idiom of his
 faithful follower

 oh without doubt without doubt

 it does me good to hear that you think
 so hes a prancing beast and so we mustnt
 startle him-not till i have located the stuff
 afterward-

  ricardo paused sinister in the stillness of
  his pose suddenly he got up with a swift
  movement and gazed down at his chief in
  moody abstraction mr jones did not stir

   theres one thing thats worrying me be-
  gan ricardo in a subdued voice

 only one was the faint comment from
 the motionless body on the bedstead

  i mean more than all the others put to-
 gether

  thats grave news

  aye grave enough its this-how do you
 feel in yourself sir are you likely to get
 bored i know them fits comes on you sud-
 denly but surely you can tell-

  martin you are an ass

 the moody face of the secretary cleared
 somewhat

 really sir well i am quite content to
 be on these terms-i mean as long as you
 dont get bored it wouldnt do sir

 for coolness ricardo had thrown open his
 shirt and rolled up his sleeves he moved
 stealthily across the room barefooted toward
 the candle the shadow of his head and shoul-
 ders growing bigger behind him on the op-
 posite wall to which the face of plain mr
 jones was turned with a feline movement
 ricardo glanced over his shoulder at the thin
 back of the specter reposing on the bed and
 then blew out the candle

  in fact i am rather amused martin
 mr jones said in the dark

 he heard the sound of a slapped thigh and
 the jubilant exclamation of his henchman

  good thats the way to talk sir

xxvii

 ricardo advanced prudently bv short darts
 from one tree-trunk to another more in the
 manner of a squirrel than a cat



   the sun had risen some time before al-
 ready the sparkle of open sea was encroaching
 rapidly on the dark cool early-morning blue
 of black diamond bay but the deep gloom
 lingered yet under the mighty pillars of the
 forest between which the secretary dodged

   he was watching number ones bungalow
 with an animal-like patience if with a very
 human complexity of purpose this was the
 second morning of such watching the first
 one had not been rewarded by success well
 strictly speaking there was no hurry

   the sun swinging above the ridge all at
 once inundated with light the space of burned
 grass in front of ricardo and the face of the
 bungalow on which his eyes were fixed leav-
 ing only the one dark spot of the doorway
 to his right to his left and behind him
 splashes of gold appeared in the deep shade
 of the forest thinning the gloom under the
 ragged roof of leaves

   this was not a very favorable circumstance
 for ricardos purpose he did not wish to be
 detected in his patient occupation for what
 he was watching for was a sight of the girl-
 that girl just a glimpse across the burned
 patch to see what she was like

    he had excellent eyes and the distance was
 not so great he would be able to distinguish
 her lace quite easily if she only came out on
 the veranda and she was bound to do that
 sooner or later he was confident that he
 could form some opinion about her-which
 he felt was very necessary before venturing
 on some steps to get in touch with her be-
 hind that swedish barons back she couldnt
 be much he knew that sort

   by protruding his head a little he com-
 manded through the foliage of a festooning
 creeper a view of the three bungalows ir-
 regularly disposed along a flat curve over
 the veranda rail of the farthermost one hung
 a dark rug of a tartan pattern amazingly con-
 spicuous ricardo could see the very checks

   a brisk fire of sticks was burning on the
 ground in front of the steps and in the sun-
 light the thin fluttering flame had paled al-
 most to invisibility-a mere rosy stir under
 a faint wreath of smoke he could see the
 white bandage on the head of pedro bending
 over it and the wisps of black hair sticking
 up weirdly he had wound that bandage him-
 self after breaking that shaggy and enormous
 head the creature balanced it like a load
 staggering toward the steps ricardo could
 see a small long-handled saucepan at the end
 of a great hairy paw

 yes he could see all that there was to be


munseys magazine

seen far and near excellent eyes the only
thing they could not penetrate was the dark
oblong of the doorway on the veranda under
the low eaves of the bungalows roof and
that was vexing it was an outrage ricardo
was easily outraged

  surely she would come out presently why
didnt she surely the fellow did not tie her
up to the bed-post before leaving the house

  nothing appeared ricardo was as still as
the leafy cables of creepers depending in a
convenient curtain from the mighty limb sixty
feet above his head his very eyelids were
still and this unblinking watchfulness gave
him the dreamy air of a cat posed on a hearth-
rug contemplating the fire

  was he dreaming there in plain sight
he had before him a white blouselike jacket
short blue trousers a pair of bare yellow
calves a pigtail long and slender-

  the confounded chink he muttered as-
tounded

  he was not conscious of having looked
away and yet right there in the middle of the
picture without having come round the right-
hand corner or the left-hand corner of the
house without falling from the sky or surging
up from the ground wang had become visible
as large as life and engaged in the young-
ladyish occupation of picking flowers

  step by step stooping repeatedly over the
flower-beds at the foot of the veranda the
startlingly materialized chinaman passed off
the scene in a very commonplace manner by
going up the steps and disappearing in the
darkness of the doorway

  only then the yellow eyes of martin ricar-
do lost their intent fixity he understood that
it was time for him to be moving that bunch
of flowers going into the house in the hand of
a chinaman was for the breakfast-table
what else could it be for

   ill give you flowers he muttered threat-
eningly you wait

  another moment just for a glance toward
the jones bungalow whence he expected heyst
to issue on his way to that breakfast so of-
fensively decorated and ricardo began his
retreat his impulse his desire was for a
rush into the open face to face with the ap-
pointed victim for what he called a  ripping
up visualized greedily and always with the
swift preliminary stooping movement on his
part-the forerunner of certain death to his
adversary

  this was his impulse and as it was so to
speak constitutional it was extremely diffi-
cult to resist when his blood was up what

could be more trying than to have to skulk
and dodge and conceal oneself mentally and
physically when ones blood was up

  mr secretary ricardo was being severely
tried as he began his retreat from his post of
observation behind a tree opposite heysts
bungalow using great care to remain unseen
his proceedings were made easier by the de-
clivity of the ground which sloped sharply to
the waters edge there his feet feeling the
warmth of the islands rocky foundation al-
ready heated by the sun through the thin
soles of his straw slippers he was as it were
sunk out of sight of the houses

  a short scramble of some twenty feet
brought him up again to the upper level at
the place where the jetty had its root in the
shore he leaned his back against one of the
uprights which still held up the tropical belt
coal companys sign-board above the mound
of derelict coal nobody could have guessed
how much his blood was up to contain him-
self he folded his arms tightly on his breast

  what exasperated him just now was his in-
ability to understand heyst ricardo was hu-
man enough to suffer from the discovery of his
limitations no he couldnt size him up he
could kill him with extreme ease-a growl and
a spring-but that was forbidden

  he moved on his head swimming a little
with the repressed desire of violence and
came out openly in front of the bungalows
as if he had just been down to the jetty to
look at the boat the sunshine enveloped him
very brilliant very still very hot the three
buildings faced him the one with the rug
on the balustrade was the most distant next
to it was the empty bungalow the nearest
with the flower-beds at the foot of its veranda
contained that bothersome girl who had man-
aged so provokingly to keep herself invisible

  ricardo could not hang about openly much
longer but like a concealed magnet the girl
exercised her attraction as he went on he
deviated toward the bungalow though his
movements were deliberate his feral instincts
had such sway that if he had seen heyst walk-
ing toward him he would have had to satisfy
his need of violence

  but he saw nobody wang was at the back
of the house keeping the coffee hot against
number ones return for breakfast even the
simian pedro was out of sight no doubt
crouching on the door-step his eyes fastened
with animal-like devotion on mr jones who
was in discourse with heyst in the other
bungalow-the conversation of an evil specter
with a disarmed man watched by an ape
victory



    his will having very little to do with it
 ricardo darting swift glances in all directions
 found himself at the steps of the heyst bunga-
 low once there falling under an uncontrol-
 lable force of attraction he mounted them
 with a savage and stealthy action of his limbs
 and paused for a moment under the eaves to
 listen to the silence presently he advanced
 one leg over the threshold -it seemed to
 stretch itself like a limb of india-rubber-
 planted his foot within brought up the other
 swiftly and stood inside the room turning
 his head from side to side

    to his eyes brought in there from the daz-
 zling sunshine all was gloom for a moment
 his pupils like a cats dilating swiftly he
 distinguished an enormous quantity of books
 he was amazed and he was put off too he
 was vexed in his astonishment though every
 muscle of his body quivered with savage ex-
 citement he kept all his wits about him he
 had meant to note the aspect and nature of
 things and hoped to draw some useful in-
 ference some hint as to the man but what
 guess could one make out of a multitude of
 books

   he didnt know what to think and he
 formulated his bewilderment in the mental
 exclamation

     what the deuce has this fellow been try-
 ing to set up here-a school

    he gave a prolonged stare to the portrait
 of heysts father that severe profile ignoring
 the vanities of this earth his eyes gleamed
 sidewise at the heavy silver candlesticks-
 signs of opulence he prowled as a stray cat
 entering a strange place might do for if
 ricardo had not wangs miraculous gift of
 materializing and vanishing rather than com-
 ing and going he could be nearly as noiseless
 in his less elusive movements

    he noted the back door standing just ajar
 and all the time his slightly pointed ears at
 the utmost stretch of watchfulness kept in
 touch with the profound silence outside en-
 veloping the absolute stillness of the house

   he had not been in the room two minutes
 when it occurred to him that he must be
 alone in the bungalow the woman most
 likely had sneaked out and was walking about
 somewhere in the grounds at the back she
 had probably been ordered to keep out of
 sight why because the fellow mistrusted
 his guests or was it because he mistrusted
 her

 for some time he had been looking at a
 closed door on the other side of the room
 he would look into that other room and per-

   haps see something more informing than a
 confounded lot of books as he crossed over
 he thought recklessly

      if the beggar comes in suddenly and
 starts to prance ill rip him up and be done
 with it

    he laid his hand on the handle and felt the
 door come unlatched before he pulled it
 open he listened again to the silence he felt
 it all about him complete without a flaw

    the necessity of prudence had exasperated
 his self-restraint a mood of ferocity woke
 up in him and as always at such times he
 became physically aware of the sheeted knife
 strapped to his leg

    he pulled at the door with fierce curiosity
 it came open without a squeak of hinge with-
 out a rustle with no sound at all and he
 found himself glaring at the opaque surface
 of some rough blue stuff like serge a cur-
 tain was fitted inside heavy enough and long
 enough not to stir

    a curtain this unexpected veil baffling
 his curiosity checked his bruskness he did
 not fling it aside with an impatient movement
 he only looked at it closely as if its texture
 had to be examined before his hand could
 touch such stuff

    in this interval of hesitation he seemed to
 detect a flaw in the perfection of the silence
 the faintest possible rustle which his ears
 caught and instantly in the effort of con-
 scious listening lost again no everything
 was still inside and outside the house but
 he had no longer the sense of being alone
 there

    when he put out his hand toward the mo-
 tionless folds it was with extreme caution
 and only to push the stuff aside a little ad-
 vancing his head at the same time to peep
 within a moment of complete immobility
 ensued then without anything else of him
 stirring his head shrank back on his shoul-
 ders and his arm descended slowly to his side
 he had seen a woman in there the very
 woman

    in that room lighted dimly bv the reflec-
 tion of the outer glare she loomed up strange-
 ly big and shadowy at the other end of the
 narrow room with her back to the door she
 was doing her hair with her bare arms up-
 lifted one of them gleamed pearlv white
 the other detached its perfect form in black
 against the unshuttered uncurtained square of
 window she was there her fingers busy with
 her dark hair utterly unconscious exposed
 and defenseless-and tempting

 ricardo drew back one foot and pressed his


munseys magazine

elbows close to his sides his chest started
heaving convulsively as if he were wrestling
or running a race his body began to sway
gently back and forth the self-restraint was
at an end his psychology must have its way
the instinct for the feral thing could no
longer be denied ravish or kill-it was all
one to him as long as by the act he liberated
the repressed soul of savagery which had suf-
fered within him for so long

  after a quick glance back over his shoulder
which hunters of big game tell us no lion or
tiger omits to give before charging home ri-
cardo charged head first straight at the cur-
tain the stuff tossed violently upward by
his rush settled itself with a slow floating
motion into vertical folds motionless without
a shudder even in the still warm air

  the clock -which once upon a time had
measured the hours of philosophic meditation
-could not have ticked away more than five
seconds when wang materialized within the
living-room his concern primarily was with
the delayed breakfast but at once his slant-
ing eyes became immovably fixed upon the
unstirring curtain for it was behind it that
he had located the strange deadened scuffling
sounds which filled the empty room

  the slanting eyes of his race could not
achieve a round amazed stare but they be-
came still dead still and his impassive yellow
face grew all at once care-worn and lean with
the sudden strain of intense doubtful fright-
ened watchfulness contrary impulses swayed
his body rooted to the floor-mats he even
went so far as to extend his hand toward the
curtain he could not reach it as he stood
and he didnt make the necessary step for-
ward

  the mysterious struggle was going on with
a quick thumping of bare feet as in a wres-
tling-match it was a mute fierceness of con-
test no human sound hiss groan murmur or
exclamation coming through the curtain

  a chair fell over in there not with a crash
but lightly as if just grazed and a faint
metallic ring of the tin bath succeeded final-
ly the tense silence as of two adversaries
locked in a deadly grip was ended by the
heavy dull thud of a soft body flung against
the inner partition of planks it seemed to
shake the whole bungalow

  by that time yalking backward his eyes
his very throat strained with fearful excite-
ment his extended arm still pointing at the
curtain wang had disappeared through the

back door once out in the compound he
bolted round the end of the house emerging
innocently between the two bungalows he
lingered and lounged in the open where any-
body issuing from any of the dwellings was
bound to see him-a self-possessed chinaman
idling there with nothing but perhaps an un-
served breakfast on his mind

  it was at this time that wang made up hi
mind to give up all connection with number
one a man not only disarmed but already half
vanquished till that morning he had had
doubts as to his course of action but this
overheard scuffle decided the question num-
ber one was a doomed man-one of those
beings whom it is unlucky to help

  even as he walked about with a fine air of
unconcern wang wondered that no sound of
any sort was to be heard inside the house
for all he knew the white mem might have
been scuffling in there with an evil spirit
which had of course killed her for nothing
visible came out of the house as he watched
out of the slanting corner of his eye the
sunshine and the silence outside the bungalow
reigned undisturbed

  but in the house the silence of the big room
would not have struck an acute ear as per-
fect it was troubled by a stir so faint that
it could hardly be called a ghost of whisper-
ing from behind the curtain

  ricardo feeling his throat with tender care
breathed out admiringly

  you have fingers like steel jiminy
you have muscles like a giant

  luckily for the girl ricardos onset had
been so sudden-she was winding her two
heavy tresses round her head-that she had
no time to lower her arms this which saved
them from being pinned to her sides gave her
a better chance to resist

  his spring had nearly thrown her down
luckily again she was standing so near the
wall that though she was driven against it
headlong yet the shock was not heavy enough
to knock all the breath out of her body on
the contrary it helped her first instinctive at-
tempt to drive her assailant backward

  after the first gasp of a surprise that was
really too overpowering for a cry she was
never in doubt of the nature of the danger
she defended herself in the full clear knowl-
edge of it from the force of instinct which is
the true source of every great display of
energy and with a determination which could
hardly have been expected from a girl who
cornered in a dim corridor by the red-faced
stammering schomberg had trembled with
victory



shame disgust and fear had drooped terri-
fied before mere words spluttered odiously
by a man who had never in his life laid his
big paw on her

  this new enemys attack was simple
straightforward violence it was not the
slimy underhand plotting to deliver her up
like a slave which had sickened her heart and
had made her feel in her loneliness that her
oppressors were too many for her she was
no longer alone in the world now she re-
sisted without a moment of faltering because
she was no longer deprived of moral support
because she was a human being who counted
because she was no longer defending herself
for herself alone because of the faith that
had been born in her-the faith in the man of
her destiny and perhaps in the heaven which
had sent him so wonderfully to cross her path

  she had defended herself principally by
gripping ricardos windpipe with her fingers
till she felt a slight relaxation of the terrific
hug in which he stupidly and ineffectually
persisted to hold her then with a supreme
effort of her arms and of her suddenly raised
knee she sent him flying against the partition
the cedar-wood chest stood in the way and
ricardo with a thump which boomed hollow
through the whole bungalow fell on it in a
sitting posture half strangled and exhausted
not so much by the efforts as by the emo-
tions of the struggle

  with the recoil of her exerted strength she
too staggered back a little and sat on the
edge of the bed her legs crossed breathing
quickly but calm and unabashed she busied
herself in readjusting under her arms the
brown and yellow figured celebes sarong the
tuck of which had come undone during the
fight then folding her bare arms tightly on
her breast she leaned forward on them de-
termined and without fear

  ricardo leaning forward too his nervous
force gone crestfallen like a beast of prey
that has missed its spring met her big gray
eyes looking at him-wide open observing
mysterious-from under the dark arches of
her courageous eyebrows their faces were
not a foot apart

  he ceased feeling about his aching throat
and dropped the palms of his hands heavily
on his knees he was not looking at her bare
shoulders at her strong arms he was looking
down at the floor he had lost one of his
straw slippers a chair with a white dress
on it had been overturned these with
splashes of water from a misplaced sponge-
bath were the only traces of the struggle

  ricardo swallowed twice consciously as if
to make sure of his throat before he spoke
again

   all right i never meant to hurt you-
though i am no joker when it comes to it
he pulled up the leg of his pajamas to ex-
hibit the strapped knife she glanced at it
without moving her head and murmured with
scornful bitterness

   ah yes-with that stuck in my side
never otherwise

  he shook his head with a sort of horror

   listen i am quiet now straight- am
i dont need to explain why-you know how
it is and i can see now this wasnt the way
with you

  she made no sound her still upward gaze
had a patient mournfulness which troubled
him like a suggestion of an inconceivable
depth he added doubtfully

   you are not going to make a noise about
this silly try of mine

  she moved her head the least bit
jee-miny you are a wonder he mur-
mured earnestly relieved more than she could
have guessed

  of course if she had attempted to run out
he would have stuck the knife between her
shoulders to stop her screaming but all the
fat would have been in the fire the business
utterly spoiled and the rage of the governor
-especially when he learned the cause-
boundless

  a woman that does not make a noise after
an attempt of that kind has tacitly condoned
the offense clearly if she would pass it over
like this then he could not be so utterly re-
pugnant to her he already felt almost ten-
der toward the girl-that plucky fine girl who
had not tried to run screaming from him

   we shall be friends yet i dont give
you up dont think it friends as friends
can be he whispered confidently jee-
miny you arent a tame one neither am
i you will find that out before long

  he could not know that if she had not run
out it was because that morning under the
stress of growing uneasiness at the presence
of the incomprehensible visitors heyst had
confessed to her that it was his revolver he
had been looking for in the night that it was
gone that he was a disarmed defenseless
man she had hardly comprehended the
meaning of his confession now she better
understood what it meant

  the effort of her self-control her stillness
impressed ricardo suddenly she spoke

   what are you after


munseys magazine

  he did not raise his eyes his hands re-
posing on his knees his drooping head some-
thing reflective in his pose suggested the
weariness of a simple soul the fatigue of a
mental rather than physical contest he an-
swered the direct question by a direct state-
ment as if he were too tired to dissemble

    after the swag

  the word was strange to her the veiled
ardor of her gray gaze from under the dark
eyebrows never left ricardos face

   a swag she murmured quietly  whats
that

   why swag plunder-what your gentle-
man has been pinching right and left for years
-the pieces dont you know this
without looking up he made a motion as
if counting money into the palm of his hand
she lowered her eyes slightly to observe this
hit of pantomime but returned them to his
face at once then in a mere breath

  how do you know anything about him
she asked concealing her puzzled alarm
 what has it got to do with you

   everything was ricardos concise an-
swer in a low emphatic whisper

   he reflected that this girl was really his best
hope out of the unfaded impression of past
violence there was growing the sort of senti-
ment which prevents a man being indifferent
to a woman he has once held in his arms-
if even against her will-and still more so if
she has pardoned the outrage it becomes
then a sort of bond

  its a game of grab-see he went on
with a new inflection of intimacy in his mur-
mur he was looking straight at her now
 that fat tame slug of a gin-slinger schom-
berg put us up to it

   so strong is the impression of helpless and
persecuted misery that the girl who had
fought down a man without faltering could
not completely repress a shudder at the mere
sound of that abhorred name

   ricardo became more rapid and confidential
 he wants to pay him off-pay both of
you at that so he told me he was hot
after you he would have given all he had
into those hands of yours that have nearly
strangled me but you couldnt eh nohow
-what -he paused  so rather than-
you followed a gentleman

  he noticed a slight movement of her head
 same here-rather than be a wage-slave
only these foreigners arent to be trusted
youre too good for him a man that will rob
his best chum she raised her head he
w-ent on well pleased with his progress whis-

pering hurriedly yes i know all about
him so you may guess how hes likely to
treat a woman after a bit

  he did not know that he was striking terror
into her breast now still the gray eyes re-
mained fixed on him unmovably watchful as
if sleepy under the white forehead she was
beginning to understand his words conveyed
a definite dreadful meaning to her mind
which he proceeded to enlighten further in a
convinced murmur

   you and i are made to understand each
other born alike bred alike i guess you
are not tame same here you have been
chucked out into the world same here

  her stillness her appalled stillness wore to
him an air of friendly attention he asked
bruskly

   where is it

  she made an effort to breathe out
  wheres what

  his tone expressed excited secrecy

   the swag-plunder-pieces its a game
of grab we must have it but it isnt easy
and so you must lend a hand come is it
kept in the house

  as often with women her wits were sharp-
ened by the very terror of the glimpsed
menace she shook her head negatively

   no

   sure

   sure she said

  aye thought so does your gentleman
trust you

  again she shook her head

   blamed yporcrite he said feelingly and
then reflected  hes one of the tame ones
aint he

   you had better find out for yourself she
said

   you trust me i dont want to die before
you and i have made friends this was
said with a strange air of feline gallantry
then tentatively  but he could be brought
to trust you couldnt he

   trust me she said in a tone which bor-
dered on despair but which he mistook for
derision

   stand in with us he urged  give the
chuck to all this blamed yporcrisy perhaps
without being trusted you have managed to
find out something already eh

   perhaps i have she uttered with lips that
seemed to her to be freezing

  ricardo now looked at her calm face with
something like respect he was even a little
awed by her stillness by her economy of
words
victory



  womanlike she felt the effect she had pro-
duced the effect of knowing much and of
keeping all her knowledge in reserve so far
somehow this had come about of itself thus
encouraged directed in the way of duplicity
the refuge of the weak she made a heroically
conscious effort and forced her stiff cold lips
into a smile

  duplicity-the refuge of the weak and the
cowardly but of the disarmed too nothing
stood between the enchanted dream of her
existence and a cruel catastrophe but her
duplicity

  it seemed to her that the man sitting there
before her was an unavoidable presence which
she had known all her life he was the em-
bodied evil of the world she was not ashamed
of her duplicity with a womans frank cour-
age as soon as she saw that opening she
threw herself into it without reserve with
only one doubt-that of her own strength

  she was appalled by the situation but al-
ready all her aroused femininity-understand-
ing that whether heyst loved her or not she
loved him and feeling that she had brought
this on his head-faced the danger with a
passionate desire to defend him

xxix

  to ricardo the girl had been so unforeseen
that he was unable to bring down upon her
the light of his critical faculties her smile
appeared to him to be full of promise he had
not expected her to be what she was who
from the talk he had heard could expect to
meet a girl like this

  she was a blooming miracle he said to him-
self familiarly yet with a tinge of respect
she was no meat for the likes of that tame
respectable gin-slinger ricardo grew hot
with indignation her courage her physical
strength demonstrated at the cost of his dis-
comfiture commanded his sympathy he felt
himself drawn to her by the proofs of her
amazing spirit such a girl she had a strong
soul and her reflective disposition to throw
over her connection proved that she was no
hypocrite

  is your gentleman a good shot he said
looking down on the floor again as if in-
different

  she hardly understood the phrase but in
its form it suggested some accomplishment
it was safe to whisper an affirmative

   mine too-and better than good ricar-
do murmured and then in a confidential
burst i am not so good at it but i carry
a pretty deadly thing about me all the same

  he tapped his leg she was past the stage
of shudders now stiff all over unable even
to move her eyes she felt an awful mental
tension which was like blank forgetfulness
ricardo tried to influence her in his own way

  and my gentleman is not the sort that
would drop me he aint no foreigner where-
as you with your baron you dont know
whats before you-or rather being a wom-
an you know only too well much better not
to wait for the chuck pile in with us and
get your share-of the plunder i mean you
have some notion about it already

  she felt that if she as much as hinted by
word or sign that there was no such thing on
the island heysts life wouldnt be worth half
an hours purchase but all power of com-
bining words had vanished in the tension of
her mind words themselves were too diffi-
cult to think of-all except the word yes
the saving word

  she whispered it with not a feature of her
face moving to ricardo the faint and con-
cise sound seemed to prove a cool reserved
assent more worth having from that amazing
mistress of herself than a thousand words
from any other woman he thought with
exultation that he had come upon one in a
million-in ten million his whisper became
frankly entreating

  thats good now all youve got to do
is to make sure where he keeps his swag only
do be quick about it i cant stand much
longer this crawling-on-the-stomach business
so as not to scare your gentleman what do
you think a fellow is-a reptile

  she started without seeing any one as a
person in the night sits staring and listens to
deadly sounds to evil incantations and al-
ways in her head there was that tension of the
mind trying to get hold of something of a
saving idea which seemed to be so near and
could not be captured

  suddenly she seized it yes-she had to
get that man out of the house at that very
moment raised outside not very near but
heard distinctly heysts voice uttered the
words

   have you been looking out for me
wang

  with a convulsive movement she sat up
straight but had no power to rise ricardo
on the contrary was on his feet on the in-
stant as noiseless as a cat his yellow eyes
gleamed gliding here and there but he too
seemed unable to make another movement
only his mustache stirred visibly like the
feelers of some animal


munseys magazine

  wangs answer  ya tuan was heard by
the two in the room but more faintly then
heyst again

   all right you may bring the coffee in
mem putih out in the room yet

  to this question wang made no answer

  ricardos and the girls eyes met utterly
without expression all their faculties being
absorbed in listening for the first sound of
heysts footsteps for any sound outside which
would mean that ricardos retreat was cut off
both understood perfectly well that wang
must have gone round the house and that he
was now at the back making it impossible for
ricardo to slip out unseen that way before
heyst came in at the front

  a darkling shade settled on the face of the
devoted secretary here was the business ut-
terly spoiled it was the gloom of anger and
even of apprehension

  he would perhaps have made a dash for it
through the back door if heyst had not been
heard ascending the front steps he climbed
them slowly very slowly like a man who is
discouraged or weary-or simply thoughtful
and ricardo had a mental vision of his face
with his martial mustache the lofty forehead
the impassive features and the quiet medi-
tative eyes

  trapped confound it after all perhaps
the governor was right women had to be
shunned fooling with this one had apparent-
ly ruined the whole business for trapped as
he was he might just as well kill since any-
how to be seen was to be unmasked but he
was too fair-minded to be angry with the girl

  heyst had paused on the veranda or in the
very doorway

   i shall be shot down like a dog if i aint
quick ricardo muttered audibly

  he stooped swiftly to get hold of his knife
and the next moment he would have hurled
himself out through the curtain nearly as
prompt and fully as deadly to heyst as an
unexpected thunderbolt the feel more than
the strength of the girls hand clutching at
his shoulder checked him he swung round
crouching with a yellow upward glare ah
was she turning against him

  he would have stuck his knife into the hol-
low of her-bare throat if he had not seen her
qlher hand pointing to the window it was a
long opening high up close under the ceiling
almost with a single pivoting shutter

  while he was still looking at it she moved
noiselessly away picked up the overturned
chair and placed it against the wall then
she looked round but he didnt need to be

beckoned to in two long tiptoeing strides
he was at her side

   be quick she gasped

  he seized her hand and wrung it with all
the force of his dumb gratitude as a man
does to a chum when there is no time for
words then he mounted the chair

  ricardo was short-too short to get over
without a noisy scramble he hesitated an
instant she watchful bore rigidly on the seat
with her beautiful bare arms while light and
sure he used the back of the chair as a
ladder the masses of her brown hair fell all
about her face

  footsteps resounded in the next room and
heysts voice not very loud called her by
name

   lena

  yes in a minute she answered in a
clear tone which she knew would most likely
prevent heyst from coming it at once

  when she looked up ricardo had vanished
letting himself down outside so lightly that
she had not heard the slightest noise she
stood up then bewildered frightened as if
awakened from a drugged sleep with heavy
downcast unseeing eyes her fortitude tired
out her imagination as if dead within her
and unable to keep her fear alive

  heyst moved about aimlessly in the other
room this sound roused her exhausted wits
at once she began to think hear see -and
what she saw-or rather recognized for her
eyes had been resting on it all the time-was
ricardos straw slipper lost in the scuffle
lying near the bath she had just time to
step forward and plant her foot on it when
the curtain shook and pushed aside disclosed
heyst in the doorway

  out of the appeased enchantment of the
senses she had found with him like a sort of
bewitched state his danger brought a sensa-
tion of warmth to her breast she felt some-
thing stir in there something profound like a
new sort of life-the revelation of her love
for him

  the room was in partial darkness ricardo
having accidentally swung the pivoted shutter
as he went out of the window heyst peered
from the doorway

   why you havent done your hair yet
he said

   i wont stop to do it now i shant be
long she replied steadily and remained still
feeling ricardos slipper under her foot

  heyst with a movement of retreat let the
curtain drop slowly on the instant she
stooped for the slipper and with it in her
victory



hand spun round wildly looking for some
hiding-place but there was no such spot in
the bare room the chest the leather trunk
a dress or two of hers hanging on pegs-there
was no place where the merest hazard might
not guide heysts hand at any moment

  her wildly roaming eyes were caught by the
half-closed window she ran to it and by
raising herself on her toes was able to reach
the shutter with her finger-tips she pushed
it square stole back to the middle of the room
and turning about swung her arm regulating
the force of the throw so as not to let the
slipper fly too far and hit the edge of the
overhanging eaves it was a task of the
nicest judgment for the muscles of those round
arms still quivering from the deadly wrestle
with a man for that brain tense with the
excitement of the situation

  at last the slipper left her hand as soon
as it passed the opening it was out of her
sight she listened she did not hear it strike
anything it just vanished as if it had wings
to fly on through the air not a sound it
had gone clear

  her valiant arms hanging close against her
sides she stood as if turned into stone a
faint whistle reached her ears the forgetful
ricardo becoming very much aware of his
loss had been hanging about in great anxiety
which was relieved by the appearance of the
slipper flying from under the eaves and now
thoughtfully he had ventured a whistle to put
her mind at ease

  suddenly the girl reeled forward she
saved herself from a fall only by embracing
with both arms one of the tall rudely carved
posts holding the mosquito-net above the bed
for a long time she clung to it with her fore-
head leaning against the wood

   one side of her loosened sarong had slipped
down as low as her hip the long brown
tresses of her hair hung down in wisps lank
as if wet looking almost black against her
white body her uncovered flank damp with
the sweat of anguish and fatigue gleamed
coldly with the immobility of polished marble
in the hot diffused light falling through the
window above her head-a dim reflection of
the consuming passionate blaze of sunshine
outside all aquiver with the effort to set the
earth on fire to burn it to ashes

  heyst seated at the table with his chin on
his breast raised his head at the faint rustle
of lenas dress he was startled by the dead
pallor of her cheeks by something lifeless in

her eyes which looked at him strangely with-
out recognition but to his anxious inquiries
she answered reassuringly if in a very low
voice that there was nothing the matter with
her really she had felt giddy on rising she
had even had a moment of faintness after her
bath she had to sit down to wait for it to
pass this had made her late dressing

    i didnt try to do my hair i didnt want
to keep you waiting any longer she said

  he was unwilling to press her with ques-
tions about her health since she seemed to
make light of this indisposition she had not
done her hair but she had brushed if and
had tied it with a ribbon behind with her
forehead uncovered she looked very young
almost a child a care-worn child a child with
something on its mind

  what surprised heyst was the non-appear-
ance of wang the chinaman had always
materialized at the precise moment of his
service neither too soon nor too late this
time the usual miracle failed what was the
meaning of this

  heyst raised his voice-a thing he disliked
doing it was promptly answered from the
compound

   ada tuanl 

  lena leaning on her elbow with her eyes
on her plate did not seem to hear anything
when wang entered with a tray his narrow
eyes tilted inward by the prominence of sali-
ent cheek-bones kept her under stealthy ob-
servation all the time neither the one nor
the other of that white couple paid the slight-
est attention to him and he withdrew without
having heard them exchange a single word

   he squatted on his heels on the back veran-
da his chinamans mind very clear but not
far-reaching was made up according to the
plain reason of things such as it appeared to
him in the light of his simple feeling for self-
preservation untrammeled by any notions of
romantic honor or tender conscience his
yellow hands lightly clasped hung idly be-
tween his knees the graves of wangs an-
cestors were far away his parents were dead
his elder brother was a soldier in the yamun
of some mandarin away in formosa no one
near by had a claim on his veneration or his
obedience he had been for years a laboring
restless vagabond his only tie in the world
was the alfuro woman in exchange for whom
he had given away some considerable part of
his hard-earned substance and his duty in
reason could be to no one but himself

  the scuffle behind the curtain was a thing
of bad augury for that number one for

magazine

whom the chinaman had neither love nor dis-
like he had been awed enough by that de-
velopment to hang back with the coffee-pot till
at last the white man was induced to call him
in wang went in with curiosity

   certainly the white woman looked as if she
 had been wrestling with a spirit which had
  managed to tear half her blood out of her be-
 fore letting her go as to the man wang had
 long looked upon him as being in some sort
 bewitched and now he was doomed

   he heard their voices in the room heyst
 was urging the girl to go and lie down again
 he was extremely concerned she had eaten
 nothing

    the best thing for you you really must

   she sat listless shakingher head from time
 lo time negatively as if nothing could be any
 good but he insisted she saw the beginning
 of wonder in his eyes and suddenly gave way

    perhaps i had ijetter

   she did not want to arouse his wonder
 which would lead him straight to suspicion
 he must not suspect

   already with the consciousness of her love
 for this man of that something rapturous and
 profound going beyond the mere embrace
 there was born in her a womans innate mis-
 trust of masculinity of that seductive strength
 allied to an absurd delicate shrinking from
 the recognition of the naked necessity of facts
 which never yet frightened a woman worthy
 of the name

   she had no plan but her mind quieted
 down somewhat by the very effort to preserve
 outward composure for his sake perceived
 that her behavior had secured at any rate a
 short period of safety perhaps because of
 the similarity of their miserable origin in the
 dregs of mankind she had understood ricar-
 do perfectly he would keep quiet for a time
 now

   in this momentarily soothing certitude her
 bodily fatigue asserted itself the more over-
 poweringly since its cause was not so much
 the demand on her strength as the awful sud-
 denness of the stress she had had to meet
 she would have tried to overcome it from the
 mere instinct of resistance if it had not been
 for heysts alternate pleadings and commands
 before this eminently masculine fussing she
 felt thg womans need to give way the sweet-
 ness of surrender

    i will do anything you like she said

   getting up she was surprised by a wave of
 languid weakness that came over her em-
 bracing and enveloping her like warm water
 with a noise in her ears as of a breaking sea

   you must help me along she added
quickly

  while he put his arm round her waist-not
by any means an uncommon thing for him to
do-she found a special satisfaction in the
feeling of being thus sustained she aban-
doned all her weight to that encircling and
protecting pressure while a thrill went through
her at the sudden thought that it was she who
would have to protect him to be the defender
of a man who was strong enough to lift her
bodily as he was doing even then in his two
arms

  for heyst had done this as soon as they
had crept through the doorway of the room
he thought it was quicker and simpler to
carry her the last step or two he had grown
really too anxious to be aware of the effort
he lifted her high and gently deposited
her on the bed as one lays a child on its side
in a cot then he sat down on the edge
masking his concern with a smile which ob-
tained no response from the dreamy immobili-
ty of her eyes

  but she sought his hand seized it eagerly
and while she was pressing it with all the force
of which she was capable the sleep she needed
overtook her suddenly overwhelmingly as it
overtakes a child in a cot with her lips parted
for a safe endearing word which she had
thought of but had no time to utter

  the usual flaming silence brooded over
samburan

   what in the world is this new mystery
murmured heyst to himself contemplating
her deep slumber

  it was so deep this enchanted sleep that
when some time afterward he gently tried to
open her fingers and free his hand he suc-
ceeded w-ithout provoking the slightest stir

   there is some very simple explanation no
doubt he thought as he stole out into the
living-room

  absent-mindedly he pulled a book out of
the top shelf and sat dowrn with it but even
after he had opened it on his knee and had
been staring at the pages for a time he had
not the slightest idea of what it was about
he stared and stared at the crowded parallel
lines it was only when raising his eyes for
no particular reason he saw wang standing
motionless on the other side of the table that
he regained complete control of his faculties

   oh yes he said as if suddenly reminded
of a forgotten appointment of a not par-
ticularly welcome sort

  he waited a little and then with reluctant
curiosity forced himself to ask the silent
victory



wang what he had to say he had some idea
that the matter of the vanished revolver
would come up at last but the guttural
sounds which proceeded from the chinaman
did not refer to that delicate subject his
speech was concerned with cups saucers
plates forks and knives all those had been
put away in the cupboards on the back veran-
da where they belonged perfectly clean  all
ploper

   heyst wondered at the scrupulosity of a man
who was about to abandon him for he was
not surprised to hear wang conclude the ac-
count of his stewardship with the words

   i go now

  oh you go now said heyst leaning
back his book on his knee

  es me no likee one man two man
thlee man-no can do me go now

   whats frightening you away like this
asked heyst while through his mind flashed
the hope that something enlightening might
come from that being so unlike himself ta-
king contact with the world with a simplicity
and directness of which his own mind was not
capable  why he went on  you are
used to white men you know them well

   yes me savee them assented wang
inscrutably  me savee plenty

  all that he really knew was his own mind
he had made it up to withdraw himself and
the alfuro woman from the uncertainties of
the relations which were going to establish
themselves between those white men

  it was pedro who had been the first cause
of wangs suspicion and fear the chinaman
had seen wild men he had penetrated in the
train of a chinese pedler up one or two of the
bornean rivers into the country of the dyaks
he had also been in the interior of mindanao
where there are people who live in trees-
savages no better than animals but a hairy
brute like pedro with his great fangs and
ferocious growls was altogether beyond his
conception of anything that could be looked
upon as human

  the strong impression made on him by
pedro was the prime inducement that led
wang to purloin the revolver reflection on
the general situation and on the insecurity of
number one came later after he had ob-
tained possession of the revolver and of the
box of cartridges out of the table drawer in
the living-room

   oh you savee plenty about white men
heyst went on in a slightly bantering tone
after a moment of silent reflection in which
he had confessed to himself that the recovery

of the revolver was not to be thought of
either by persuasion or by some more forcible
means  you speak that fashion but you are
frightened of those white men over there

    me no flightened protested wang rau-
cously throwing up his head-which gave to
his throat a more strained anxious appear-
ance than ever  me no likee he added in
a quieter tone  me velly sick

   he put his hand over the region under the
breast-bone

    that said heyst serenely positive  be-
 long one piccee lie that isnt proper man-
 talk at all and after stealing my revolver
 too

   he had suddenly decided to speak about it
because this frankness could not make the
situation much worse than it was he did
not suppose for a moment that wang had the
revolver anywhere about his person and after
having thought the matter over he had ar-
rived at the conclusion that the chinaman
never meant to use the weapon against him

   after a slight start because the direct
charge had taken him unawares wang tore
open the front of his jacket with a convulsive
show of indignation

  no hab got look-see he mouthed in
pretended anger

   he slapped his bare chest violently he un-
 covered his very ribs all astir with the pant-
 ing of outraged virtue his smooth stomach
 heaved with indignation he started his wide
 blue breeches flapping about his yellow calves
 heyst watched him quietly

    i never said you had it on you he ob-
served without raising his voice but the
revolver is gone from where i kept it

   me no savee levolver wang said ob-
stinately

   the book lying open on heysts knee slipped
 suddenly and he made a sharp movement to
 catch it up wang was unable to see the
 reason of this because of the table and leaped
 away from what seemed to him a threatening
 symptom when heyst looked up the china-
 man was already at the door facing the room
 not frightened but alert

   whats the matter asked heyst

   wang nodded his shaven head significantly
at the curtain closing the doorway of the bed-
room

    me no likee he repeated

  what the deuce do you mean heyst
was genuinely amazed dont like what

   wang pointed a long lemon-colored finger
at the motionless folds

    two he said

  two what i dont understand

   suppose you savee you no like that
fashion me savee plenty me go now

   heyst had risen from his chair but wang
kept his ground in the doorway for a little
while longer his almond-shaped eyes im-
parted to his face an expression of soft and
sentimental melancholy the muscles of his
throat moved visibly while he uttered a dis-
tinct and guttural  good-by and vanished
from number ones sight

   too perplexed to be able to think heyst
paced heavily across the room a situation
must have a side by which the mind can get
hold of it but this thing of surmises and
hints had no tangible shape it was as if the
air of samburan that refuge from life had
been poisoned-a sort ofthing against which
there was no defense from which there could
be no escape

  again he tramped across the room from
end to end and then with lighter steps passed
within the curtain where awaiied him the con-
joint mysteries of sleep and femininity

   he contemplated them united in that re-
clining and motionless body he fastened his
attention on it the light breathing did not
perceptibly stir this form of grace draped in
white its eyes closed its hair tossed loose
the pale face transfigured by the aloofness of
dreams and slumber which are like the veils
of the great beyond everything around and
the stillness itself appeared so deathlike that
heyst felt an impulse to break the silence
with some useless words but there is that in
us which at certain moments becomes dumb

   he went on looking at her the sleep-ob-
livion of this world where wakeful faces carry
in sorrow the degrading marks of the past
allowed him to perceive the wonder of her
native distinction feeling deeply all the
charm she had for him he became saddened
as if by a cruel reminder of his lost inde-
pendence at the same time he was moved
by a strange compassion for her he sighed
and went out of the room with hushed foot-
steps

   he was no sooner alone in the outer room
than very naturally he thought of the ab-
sconding wang the chinamans departure
altered the situation heyst reflected on
what would be best to do inview of that fact
for a long time he hesitated then shrugging
his shoulders wearily he walked out on the
veranda down the steps and continued at a
steady gait w-ith a thoughtful mien in the
direction of his guests bungalow

  he wanted to make an important communi-

cation and he had no other object-least of
all to give them the shock of a surprise call
nevertheless their brutish henchman not be-
ing on watch it was heysts fate to startle
mr jones and his secretary by his sudden ap-
pearance in the doorway their conversation
must have been very interesting to prevent
them from hearing the visitors approach

  in the dim room-the shutters were kept
constantly closed against the heat-heyst saw
them start apart it was mr jones who
spoke

  ah here you are again come in come
in

  heyst taking his hat off in the doorway
entered the room

xxxi

  waking up suddenly lena looked without
raising her head from the pillow at the room
in which she was alone

  the mysterious wordless whispers heard in
her slumbers were now replaced by the si-
lence of a complete wakeful recollection she
got up quickly as if to counteract the awful
sinking of her heart by the vigorous use of her
limbs but this sinking was only momentary
mistress of herself from pride from love
from necessity and also because of a womans
vanity in self-sacrifice she met heyst return-
ing from the strangers bungalow with a clear
glance and a smile the smile he managed to
answer but noticing that he avoided her
eyes she composed her lips and lowered her
gaze

  for the same reason she hastened to speak
to him in a tone of indifference which she put
on without effort as if she had grown adept
in duplicity since sunrise

  you have been over there again

   i have i thought-but you had better
know first that we have lost wang for good

  she repeated for good as if she had
not understood

   for good or evil-i shouldnt know which
if you were to ask me he has dismissed him-
self hes gone

  you expected him to go though didnt
you

  heyst sat down on the other side of the
table

  yes i expected it as soon as i discov-
ered that he had annexed my revolver he
says he hasnt taken it thats of course a
chinaman would not see the sense of con-
fessing under any circumstances to deny
any charge is a principle of right conduct
but he hardly expected to be believed he
victory



did not have it on him of that i am certain-
at least not while he was talking to me in this
room he lied with fine indignation per-
haps he was amused to see me before him
without arms and without force and perhaps
not he was a little enigmatic at the last
lena he startled me

  heyst paused the girl in profile kept her
eyelids lowered and in her quietness seemed
absorbed in her own thoughts

  he startled me repeated heyst she
noted the anxiety in his tone and turned her
head slightly to look at him across the table

   it must have been something-to startle
you she said in the depths of her parted
lips like a ripe pomegranate there was a
gleam of white teeth

   it was only a single word-and some of
his gestures he had been milking a good deal
of noise i wonder we didnt wake you up
how soundly you can sleep i say do you
feel all right now

   as fresh as can be she said treating him
to another deep gleam of a smile  i heard
no noise and im glad of it the way he
talks in his harsh voice frightens me i dont
like all these foreign people

   it was just before he went away-bolted
out i should say he nodded and pointed at
the curtain of our room he knew you were
there of course he seemed to think-he
seemed to try to give me to understand that
you were in special-well danger you know
how he talks

  she said nothing she made no sound only
the faint color ebbed out of her cheek

   yes heyst went on  he seemed to
try to warn me that must have been it
did he imagine i had forgotten your exist-
ence the only word he said was two it
sounded so at least yes  two -and that he
didnt like it

   what does that mean she whispered

   we know what the word two means dont
we lena we are two never were such a
lonely two out of the world my dear he
might have tried to remind me that he him-
self has a woman to look after why are you
so pale lena

   am i pale she asked negligently

   you are heyst was really anxious

   well it isnt from frightshe protested
truthfully

  indeed what she felt was a sort of horror
which left her absolutely in the full posses-
sion of all her faculties more difficult to bear
perhaps for that reason but not paralyzing to
her fortitude

  heyst in his turn smiled at her

  i really dont know that there is any
reason to be frightened

   i mean i am not frightened for myself
 i believe you are very plucky he said
the color had returned to her face  i con-
tinued heyst  am so rebellious to outward
impressions that i cant say that much about
myself i dont react with sufficient distinct-
ness his tone changed  you know i went
to see those men first thing this morning

  i know be careful she murmured

   i wonder how one can be careful i had
a long talk with-but i dont believe you have
seen them one of them is a fantastically
thin long person apparently ailing i shouldnt
wonder if he was really so he makes rather
a point of it in a mysterious manner i
imagine he must have suffered from tropical
fevers but not so much as he tries to make
out hes what people would call a gentle-
man he seemed on the point of volunteering
a tale of his adventures-for which i didnt
ask him-but remarked that it was a long
story some other time perhaps

    i suppose you would like to know who
i am he asked me

   i told him i would leave it to him in a
tone which between gentlemen could have
left no doubt in his mind he raised himself
on his elbow-he was lying down on the camp-
bed-and said

    i am he who is- 

  lena seemed not to be listening but when
ileyst paused she turned her head quickly to
him he took it for a movement of inquiry
but in this he was wrong a great vagueness
enveloped her impressions but all her energy
was concentrated on the struggle that she
wanted to take upon herself in a great exalta-
tion of love and self-sacrifice which is wom-
ans sublime faculty altogether on herself
every bit of it leaving him nothing not even
the knowledge of what she did if that were
possible she would fight for his admired
loved incomprehensible infinitely precious
identity-to save it to penetrate it to mingle
with it to make it her own

  observing her eyes fixed and as if sightless
-for the concentration on her purpose took
all expression out of them-heyst imagined it
to be the effect of a great mental effort

  no use asking me what he meant lena
i dont know and i did not ask him the
gentleman as i have told you before seems
devoted to mystification i said nothing-
what heyst did not know was that he had
smiled at mr jones in his usual urbane man-




muxseys magazixe

ner and that his almost mechanical smile
which had no other definite character but that
of urbanity had both irritated and discon-
certed the other man he had no idea of
being almost as enigmatical to ricardos gov-
ernor as to ricardo himself

   i said nothing he went on  and he laid
down his head again on the bundle of rugs he
uses for a pillow he affects a state of great
weakness but i suspect that hes perfectly
capable of leaping to his feet if he likes he
laid himself down at last as ive said and
seeing that i was by no means anxious for
further enlightenment on those lines he pro-
ceeded to give it to me having been eject-
ed he said from his proper sphere because he
had refused to conform to certain usual con-
ventions he was a rebel now and was coming
and going as i really did not want to listen
to all this nonsense i told him that i had
heard that sort of story about somebody else
before his grin is really ghastly he con-
fessed that i was very far from the sort of
man he expected to meet then he said

    as to me i am no blacker than the
gentleman you are thinking of and i have
neither more nor less determination 

  heyst looked across the table at lena
propped on her elbows and holding her head
in both hands she moved it a little with an
air of understanding

   nothing could be plainer eh said heyst
grimly  unless indeed this is his idea of a
pleasant joke for when he finished speaking
he burst into a long loud laugh i didnt
join him

   i wish you had she breathed out

   i didnt join him it did not occur to me
i am not much of a diplomatist i let him
have his laugh out by himself he was sha-
king all over like a merry skeleton under a
blue cotton sheet he was covered with-i be-
lieve in order to conceal the revolver that he
had in his right hand i didnt see it but i
have a distinct impression it was there in his
fist as he had not been looking at me for
some time but staring into a certain part of
the room i turned my head and saw a hairy
wild sort of creature which they take about
with them squatting on its heels in the angle
of the walls behind me he wasnt there when
i came in i didnt like the notion of that
watchful monster behind my back if i had
been less at their mercy i should certainly
have changed my position as things are now
to move would have been a mere weakness
so i remained where i was the gentleman
on the bed said he could assure me of one

thing and that was that his presence here
was no more morally reprehensible than mine

    we pursue the same ends he said  only
perhaps i pursue them with more openness
than you-with more simplicity

   thats what he said heyst went on
after looking at lena in a sort of inquiring
silence  i asked him if he knew before-
hand that i was living here but he only gave
me a ghastly grin i didnt press him for an
answer lena i thought i had better not
on her smooth forehead a ray of light al-
ways seemed to rest her loose hair parted
in the middle covered the hands sustaining
her head she seemed spellbound by the in-
terest of the narrative heyst did not pause
long he managed to continue his relation
smoothly enough beginning afresh with a
piece of comment

   he would have lied impudently-and i
detest being told a lie it makes me uncom-
fortable its pretty clear that i am not fitted
for the affairs of the wide world but i did
not want him to think that i accepted his pres-
ence too meekly so i said that his comings or
goings on the earth were none of my business
of course except that i had a natural curi-
osity to know when he would find it con-
venient to resume them he asked me to look
at the state he was in had i been all alone
here as they think i am i should have
laughed at him but not being alone-i say
lena you are sure you havent shown yourself
where you could be seen

   certain she said promptly

  he looked relieved

   you understand lena that when i ask
you to keep so strictly out of sight it is be-
cause you are not for them to look at-to talk
about my poor lena i cant help that
feeling do you understand it

  she moved her head slightly in a manner
that was neither affirmative nor negative

   people will have to see me some day she
said

   i wonder how long it will be possible for
you to keep out of sight murmured heyst
thoughtfully he bent over the table  let
me finish telling you i asked him pointblank
what it was he wanted with me but he ap-
peared extremely unwilling to come to the
point it was not really so pressing as all
that he said his secretary who was really
his partner was not present having gone
down to the wharf to look at their boat
finally the fellow proposed that he should put
off a certain communication he had to make
till the day after to-morrow i agreed but i
victory



also told him that i was not at all anxious to
hear it i had no conception in what way his
affairs could concern me

    ah mr heyst he said  you and i have
much more in common than you think 

  heyst struck the table with his fist unex-
pectedly

   it was a jeer i am sure it was

  he seemed ashamed of this outburst and
smiled faintly into the motionless eyes of the
girl

  what could i have done-even if i had
had my pockets full of revolvers

  she made an appreciative sign

   killings a sin sure enough she mur-
mured

   i went away heyst continued  i left
him there lying on his side with his eyes shut
when i got back here i found you looking ill
what was it lena you did give me a scare
then i had the interview with wang while you
rested and afterward i looked in on you
you were sleeping quietly i sat down here to
consider all these things calmly to try to
penetrate their inner meaning and see all their
outward bearing it struck me that these two
days that we have before us have the char-
acter of a sort of truce the more i thought
of it the more i felt that this was tacitly un-
derstood between jones and myself it was
to our advantage if anything can be of ad-
vantage to people caught so completely un-
awares as we are wang was gone he at
any rate had declared himself and had taken
his own line as i did not know what he
might take it into his head to do i thought i
had better warn these people that i was no
longer responsible for the chinaman i did
not want mr wang making some move which
would precipitate the action against us do
you see my point of view

  she made a sign that she understood but
all her soul was wrapped in her passionate de-
termination in an exalted belief in herself-
in the contemplation of her amazing oppor-
tunity to conquer the certitude the eternity
of that mans love

   i never saw two men heyst was saying
 more affected by a piece of information than
jones and his secretary who was back in the
bungalow by then they had not heard me
come up i told them i was sorry to intrude

    xot at all not at all said jones

   the secretary backed away into a corner
and watched me like a wary cat in fact they
both were visibly on their guard

  i am come i told them  to let you
know that my servant has deserted-gone off

   at first they looked at each other as if
they had not understood what i was saying
but very soon they seemed quite concerned

    you mean to say your chinks cleared
out said ricardo coming forward from his
corner like this-all at once what did
he do it for

   i said that a chinaman had always a
simple and precise reason for what he did
but that to get such a reason out of him was
not so easy all he had told me i said was
that he  didnt like

   they looked extremely disturbed at this
didnt like what they wanted to know

    the looks of you and your party i told
jones

  nonsense he cried out and immediate-
ly ricardo the short man struck in

    told you that what did he take you
for sir-an infant or do you take us for
kids-meaning no offense come i bet you
will tell us next that youve missed something
  i didnt mean to tell you anything of the
sort i said  but as a matter of fact it is so
 he slapped his thigh

    thought so what do you think of this
trick governor

   jones made some sort of sign to him and
then that extraordinary cat-faced associate
proposed that he and their servant should
come out and help me to catch or kill the
chink

   my object i said was not to get assist-
ance i did not intend to chase the china-
man i had come only to warn them that he
was armed and that he really objected to their
presence on the island i wanted them to un-
derstand that i was not responsible for any-
thing that might happen

    do you mean to tell us asked ricardo
 that there is a crazy chink with a six-shooter
running about loose on this island and that
you dont care

   strangely enough they did not seem to
believe my story they were exchanging sig-
nificant looks all the time ricardo stole up
close to his principal they had a confabula-
tion together and then something happened
which i did not expect its rather awkward
too

   since i would not have their assistance he
said to get hold of the chink and recover my
property the least they could do was to send
me their servant it was jones who said that
and ricardo backed up the idea

    yes yes-let our pedro cook for all
hands in your compound he isnt so bad as
he looks thats what we will do


muxseys magazixe

   he bustled out of the room to the veran-
da and let out an air-splitting whistle for their
pedro having heard the brutes answering
howl ricardo ran back into the room

    yes mr heyst this will do capitally
mr heyst you just direct him to do what-
ever you are accustonfed to have done for you
in the way of attendance see

   lena i confess to you that i was taken
completely by surprise i had not expected
anything of the sort i dont know what i
expected i am so anxious about you that 
cant keep away from these infernal scoun-
drels and only two months ago i would not
have cared i would have defied their scoun-
drelism as much as i have scorned all the
other intrusions of life but now i have
you you stole into my life and-

  heyst drew a deep breath the girl gave
him a quick wide-eyed glance

  ah thats what you are thinking of-
that you have me

  it was impossible to read the thoughts
veiled by her steady gray eyes to penetrate
the meaning of her silences her words and
even her embraces he used to come out of
her arms with the feeling of a baffled man

   if i havent you if you are not here then
where arc you cried heyst  you under-
stand me very well

  she shook her head a little her red lips
at which he looked now her lips as fascinating
as the voice that came out of them uttered
the words

   i hear what you say but what does it
mean

   it means that i could lie and perhaps
cringe for your sake

  no no dont you ever do that she
said in haste while her eyes glistened sudden-
ly you would hate me for it afterward
 hate you repeated heyst who had re-
called his polite manner no you neednt
consider the extremity of the improbable-as
yet but i will confess to you that i-how
shall i call it-that i dissembled first i
dissembled my dismay at the unforeseen re-
sult of my idiotic diplomacy do you under-
stand my dear girl

  it was evident that she did not understand
the word heyst produced his playful smile
which contrasted oddly with the worried char-
acter of his hole expression his temples
seemed to have sunk in his face looked a little
leaner

   a diplomatic statement lena is a state-
ment of which everything is true but the
sentiment which seems to prompt it i have

  never been diplomatic in my relations with
mankind-not from regard for its feelings but
from a certain regard for my own diploma-
cy doesnt go well with consistent contempt
i cared little for life and still less for death
 dont talk like that

   i dissembled my extreme longing to take
these wandering scoundrels by their throats
he went on  i have only two hands-i wish
i had a hundred to defend you-and there
were three throats by that time that pedro
was in the room i had heard him on the
veranda had he seen me engaged with their
two throats he would have been at mine like
a fierce dog or any other savage and faithful
brute i had no difficulty in dissembling my
longing for the vulgar stupid and hopeless
argument of a fight i remarked that i really
did not want a servant i couldnt think of
depriving them of their mans services but
they would not hear me they had made up
their minds

    we shall send him over at once ricardo
said  to start cooking dinner for everybody
i hope you wont mind me coming to eat it
with you in your bungalow and we will send
the governors dinner over to him here

   i had brought it on myself and could do
nothing but hold my tongue or bring on a
quarrel-some manifestation of their dark
purpose which we have no means to resist
of course you may remain invisible this eve-
ning but with that atrocious brute prowling
all the time at the back of the house how
long can your presence be concealed from
these men

  heysts distress could be felt in his silence
the girls head sustained by her hands buried
in the thick masses of her hair had a perfect
immobility

   you are certain you have not been seen
so far he asked suddenly

  the motionless head spoke

   how can i be certain you told me you
wanted me to keep out of the way i kept
out of the way i didnt ask your reason
i thought you didnt want people to know that
you had a girl like me about you

   what ashamed cried heyst

   it isnt whats right perhaps-i mean for
you-is it

  heyst lifted his hands reproachfully cour-
teous

   i look upon it as so very much right that
i couldnt bear the idea of any other than
sympathetic respectful eyes resting on you i
disliked and mistrusted these fellows from the
first didnt you understand
victory



   yes i did keep out of sight she said

  a silence fell at last heyst stirred
slightly

    all this is of very little importance now
he said with a sigh this is a question of
something infinitely worse than mere looks
and thoughts however base and contemptible
as i have told you i simply met ricardos
suggestions by silence as i was turning away
he said

    if you happen to have the key of that
storeroom of yours on you mr heyst you
may just as well let me have it i will give it
to our pedro

   i had it on me and i tendered it to him
without speaking the hairy creature was at
the door by then and caught the key which
ricardo threw to him better than any trained
ape could have done i came away without
another word all the time i had been think-
ing anxiously of you whom i had left asleep
alone here and apparently ill

   heyst interrupted himself with a listening
turn of his head he had heard the faint
sound of sticks being snapped in the com-
pound he rose and crossed the room to look
out of the back door

   and here the creature is he said re-
turning to the table  here he is already at-
tending to the fire oh my dear lena

  she had followed him with her eyes she
watched him go out on the front veranda
cautiously he stealthily lowered a couple of
screens that hung between the columns and
remained outside very still as if interested
by something on the open ground mean-
time she had risen in her turn to take a peep
into the compound

  heyst glancing over his shoulder saw her
returning to her seat he beckoned to her
and she continued to move crossing the shady
room pure and bright in her white dress her
hair loose with something of a sleep-walker
in her unhurried motion in her extended
hand in the sightless effect of her gray eyes
luminous in the half light he had never seen
such an expression in her face before it had
dreaminess in it intense attention and some-
thing like sternness

  arrested in the doorway by heysts extend-
ed arm she seemed to wake up flushed faintly
-and this flush passing off seemed to carry
away with it the strange transfiguring mood
with a courageous gesture she pushed back
the heavy masses of her hair the light clung
to her forehead her delicate nostrils quiv-
ered heyst seized her arm and whispered
excitedly

    slip out here quickly the screens will
conceal you only you must mind the stair
space they are actually out-i mean the
other two you had better see them before
you-

  she made a barely perceptible movement of
recoil checked at once and stood still heyst
released her arm

    yes perhaps i had better she said with
unnatural deliberation and stepped out on the
veranda to stand close by his side

  together one on each side of the screen
they peeped between the edge of the canvas
and the veranda-post entwined with creepers
a great heat ascended from the sun-smitten
ground in an ever-rising wave as if from
some secret store of earths fiery heart for
the sky was growing cooler already and the
sun had declined sufficiently for the shadows
of mr jones and his henchman to be project-
ed toward the bungalow side by side-one in-
finitely slender the other short and broad

  the two visitors stood still and gazed to
keep up the fiction of his invalidism mr
jones the gentleman leaned on the arm of
ricardo the secretary the top of whose hat
just came up to his governors shoulder

  do you see them heyst whispered into
the girls ear  here they are the envoys of
the outer world here they are before you-
evil intelligence instinctive savagery arm in
arm the brute force is at the back a trio
of fitting envoys perhaps-but what about the
welcome suppose i was armed could i shoot
those two down where they stand could i

  without moving her head the girl felt for
heysts hand pressed it and thereafter did
not let it go he continued bitterly playful

   i dont know i dont think so there is
a strain in me which lays me under an insen-
sate obligation to avoid even the appearance
of murder i have never pulled a trigger or
lifted my hand on a man even in self-defense

  the suddenly tightened grip of her hand
checked him

   they are making a move she murmured

   can they be thinking of coming here
heyst asked anxiously

    no they arent coming this way she said
crisply and there was another pause  they
are going back to their house she reported
finally

   after watching them a little longer she let
go heysts hand and moved away from the
screen he followed her into the room

   you have seen them now he began

 think what it was to me to see them land
in the dusk phantasms from the sea-a spec-


munseys magazine

ter a cat an ape-apparitions chimeras and
they persist thats the worst of it-they
persist they have no right to be but they
are they ought to have aroused my fury
but i have refined everything away by this
time-anger indignation scorn itself noth-
ings left but disgust since you have told me
of that abominable calumny it has become
immense-it extends even to myself he
looked up at her

    but luckily i have you yes lena here
 we are-we two

   she put both her hands on his shoulders
 and looked into his eyes he returned her
 penetrating stare it baffled him he could
 not pierce the gray veil of her gaze but the
 sadness of her voice thrilled him profoundly

    you are not reproaching me she said

    reproach what a word between us it
 could only be myself-but the mention of
 wang has given me an idea i have been not
 exactly cringing not exactly lying but still
 dissembling you have been hiding yourself
 to please me but still you have been hiding
 all this is very dignified why shouldnt we
 try begging now a noble art yes lena
 we will go out together i couldnt think of
 leaving you alone and i must-yes i must
 speak to wang we will go and seek that
 man who knows what he wants and how to
 secure what he wants we will go at once

    wait till i put my hair up she said in-
 stantly and vanished behind the curtain

   when the curtain had fallen behind her she
 turned her head back with an expression of in-
 finite and tender concern for him -for him
 whom she could never hope to understand
 and whom she was afraid she could never
 satisfy as if her passion were of a hopelessly
 lower quality unable to appease some exalted
 and delicate desire of his superior soul

   in a couple of minutes she reappeared
 they left the house by the door of the com-
 pound and passed within three feet of the
 thunderstruck pedro without even looking in
 his direction he rose from stooping over a
 fire of sticks and balancing himself clumsily
 uncovered his enormous fangs in gaping as-
 tonishment then suddenly he set off rolling
 on his bandy legs to impart to his masters the
 astonishing discovery of a woman

   as luck would have it ricardo was lounging
 alone on the veranda of the foriper counting-
 house he scented some new development at
 once and ran down to meet the trotting bear-
  like figure the deep growling noises it made

 though they had only a very remote resem-
 blance to the spanish language or indeed to
 any sort of human speech were from long
 practise quite intelligible to mr joness
 secretary

   ricardo was rather surprised he had
 imagined that the girl would continue to keep
 out of the fight that line apparently was
 given up pie did not mistrust her how
 could he he collected his wits and thought

   this was a change of policy probably on
 the part of heyst if so what could it mean
 a deep fellow unless it was her doing in

	which case-h-m-all right must be she
 would know what she was doing

    before him pedro lifting his feet alternate-
 ly swayed to and fro sidewise-his usual at-
 titude of expectation his little red eyes lost
 in the mass of hair were motionless ricardo
 stared into them with calculated contempt and
 said in a rough angry voice

    woman of course there is we know
 that without you he gave the tame monster
 a push git vamose waddle get back
 and cook the dinner which way did thev go
 then

   pedro extended a huge hairy forearm to
 show the direction and went off on his bandy
 legs advancing a few steps ricardo was just
 in time to see above some bushes two white
 helmets moving side by side in the clearing
 they disappeared

   now that he had managed to keep pedro
 from informing the governor that there was
 a woman on the island he could indulge in
 speculation as to the movements of these peo-
 ple his attitude toward mr jones had un-
 dergone a spiritual change of which he himself
 was not yet fully aware

   that morning before tiffin after his escape
 from the heyst bungalow completed in such
 an inspiring way by the recovery of the slip-
 per he had made his way to their allotted
 house reeling as he ran his head in a whirl
 he was wildly excited by visions of incon-
 ceivable promise he waited to compose him-
 self before he dared to meet the governor
 on entering the room he found mr jones sit-
 ting on the camp bedstead like a tailor on his
 board cross-legged his long back against the
 wall

   i say sir you arent going to tell me
 you are bored

   bored no where the deuce have you
 been all this time

    observing - watching - nosing around
 what else i knew you had company have
 you talked freely sir
victory



    yes i have muttered mr jones

    not downright plain sir

    no i wished you had been here you
 loaf all the morning and now you come in out
 of breath what is it whats the matter
  i havent been wasting my time out there
 said ricardo  nothings the matter i-i-
 might have hurried a bit he was in truth
 still panting only it was not with running but
 with the tumult of thoughts and sensations
 long repressed which had been set free by the
 adventure of the morning he was almost dis-
 tracted by them now he forgot himself in
 the maze of possibilities threatening and in-
 spiring and so you had a long talk he
 said to gain time

   confound you the sun hasnt affected
 your head has it why are you staring at
 me like a basilisk

    beg pardon sir wasnt aware i stared
 ricardo apologized good-humoredly  the
 sun might well affect a thicker skull than
 mine it blazes phew what do you think
 a fellow is sir-a salamander

   you ought to have been here observed
 mr jones

    did the beast give any signs of wanting to
 prance asked ricardo quickly with abso-
 lutely genuine anxiety  it wouldnt do sir
 you must play him easy for at least a couple
 of days sir i have a plan i have a notion
 that i can find out a lot in a couple of days
  you have in what way

   why by watching ricardo answered
 slowly

   mr jones grunted

    nothing new that watch eh why not
 play a little too

   ha ha ha thats a good one burst
 out the secretary fixing mr jones with mirth-
 less eyes

   the latter dropped the subject indolently

    oh you may be certain of at least two
 days he said

   ricardo recovered himself his eyes
 gleamed voluptuously

    well pull this off yet-clean-whole-
 right through if you will only trust me sir

    i am trusting you right enough said mr
 jones  its your interest too

 ricardo went out of the room it was im-
 possible for him to keep still he walked up
 and down the veranda far into the afternoon
 eying the other bungalow at every turn it
 gave no sign of being inhabited

 once or twice he stopped dead short and
 looked down at his left slipper each time he
 chuckled audibly his restlessness kept on in-

 creasing till at last it frightened him he
 caught hold of the balustrade of the veranda
 and stood still smiling not to his thoughts but
 to his feelings to the strong sense of life
 within him he abandoned himself to it care-
 lessly even recklessly he cared for no one
 friend or enemy

   at that moment mr jones called him by
name from within a shadow fell on the
secretarys face

   here sir he answered but it was a
moment before he could make up his mind to
go in

   he found his governor on his feet mr
jones was tired of lying down when there was
no necessity for it his slender form gliding
about the room came to a standstill

   ive been thinking martin of something
you suggested at the time it did not strike
me as practical but on reflection it seems to
me that to propose a game is as good a way
as any to let him understand that the time
has come to disgorge its less-how should
i say-vulgar he will know what it means
it s not a bad form to give to the business-
which in itself is crude martin crude

   want to spare his feelings jeered the
secretary in such a bitter tone that mr jones
was really surprised

    why it was your own notion confound
you

   who says it wasnt retorted ricardo
sulkily  but i am fairly sick of this crawl-
ing no no get the exact bearings of his
swag and then a rip up thats plenty good
enough for him

   his passions being thoroughly aroused a
thirst for blood was allied in him with a
thirst for tenderness-yes tenderness a sort
of anxious melting sensation pervaded and
softened his heart when he thought of that
girl-one of his own sort and at the same
time jealousy started gnawing at his breast as
the image of heyst intruded itself on his
fierce anticipation of bliss

    the crudeness of your ferocity is positive-
 ly gross martin mr jones said disdainfully

 you dont even understand my purpose i
mean to have some sport out of him just
try to imagine the atmosphere of the game-
the fellow handling the cards-the agonizing
mockery of it oh i shall appreciate this
greatly yes let him lose his money instead
of being forced to hand it over you of
course would shoot him at once but i shall
enjoy the refinement and the jest of it hes
a man of the best society ive been hounded
out of my sphere by people very much like


munseys magazine

that fellow how enraged and humiliated he
will be i promise myself some exquisite mo-
ments while watching his play

   aye and suppose he suddenly starts
prancing he may not appreciate the fun
 i mean you to be present mr jones re-
marked calmly

   well as long as i am free to plug him or
rip him up whenever i think the time has
come you are welcome to your bit of sport
sir i shant spoil it

xxxiii

  it was at this precise moment of their con-
versation that heyst had intruded on mr
jones and his secretary with his warning
about wang which he had related to lena
when he left them the two looked at each
other in wondering silence mr jones was the
first to break it

  i say martin

    yes sir

   what does this mean

   its some move blame me if i can un-
derstand

  too deep for you mr jones inquired
dryly

   its nothing but some of his infernal im-
pudence growled the secretary  you dont
believe all that about the chink do you sir
taint true

   it isnt necessary for it to be true to have
a meaning for us its the why of his coming
to tell us thistale thats important

   do you think he made it up to frighten
us asked ricardo

mr jones scowled at him thoughtfully

   the man looked worried he muttered as
if to himself  suppose that chinaman has
really stolen his money the man looked
very worried

   nothing but his artfulness sir protested
ricardo earnestly for the idea was too dis-
concerting to entertain  is it likely that he
would have trusted a chink with enough knowl-
edge to make it possible he argued warmly
 why its the very thing that he would keep
close about theres something else there
aye but what

   ha ha ha mr jones let out a ghostly
squeaky laugh ive never been placed in
such a ridiculous position before he went on
with a sepulchral equanimity of tone  its
you martin who dragged me into it how-
ever its my fault too  i ought to-but i
was really too bored to use my brain and
yours is not to be trusted you are a hot-
head

  a blasphemous exclamation of grief es-
caped from ricardo not to be trusted hot-
head he was almost tearful

   havent i heard you sir saying more than
twenty times since we got fired out from
manila that we should want a lot of capital
to w-ork the east coast with you were al-
ways telling me that to prime properly all
them officials and portuguese scalawags wre
should have to lose heavily at first werent
you always worrying about some means of get-
ting hold of a good lot of cash it wasnt
to be got hold of by allowing yourself to
become bored in that rotten dutch town and
playing a twopenny game with counfounded
beggarly bank clerks and such like well ive
brought you here where there is cash to be
got-and a big lot to a moral he added
through his set teeth

  silence fell each of them was staring into
a different corner of the room suddenly with
a slight stamp of his foot mr jones made for
the door ricardo caught him up outside

   put your arm through mine sir he
begged him gently but firmly  no use giv-
ing the game away an invalid may well come
out for a breath of fresh air after the suns
gone down a bit thats it sir but where
do you want to go why did you come out
sir

  mr jones stopped short

   i hardly know myself he confessed in a
hollow mutter staring intently at the number
one bungalow  its quite irrational he de-
clared in a still lower tone

   better go in sir suggested ricardo
 whats that those screens werent down
before hes spying from behind theril now
i bet-the dodging artful plotting beast that
he is

   why not go over there and see if we cant
get to the bottom of this game was the un-
expected proposal uttered by mr jones  he
will have to talk to us

  ricardo repressed a start of dismay but
for a moment could not speak he only
pressed the governors hand to his side in-
stinctively

   no sir what could you say do you
expect to get to the bottom of his lies how
could you make him talk it isnt time yet
to come to grips with that gent you dont
think i would hang back do you his chink
of course ill shoot like a dog the moment i
catch sight of him but as to that mr blasted
heyst the time isnt yet my heads cooler
just now than yours lets go in again why
we are exposed here suppose he took it into
victory



his head to let off a gun on us hes an un-
accountable yporcritical skunk

  allowing himself to be persuaded mr jones
returned to his seclusion the secretary how-
ever remained on the veranda-for the pur-
pose he said of seeing whether that chink
wasnt sneaking around in which case he pro-
posed to take a long shot at the galoot and
chance the consequences his real reason was
that he wanted to be alone away from the
governors deep-sunk eyes

  he felt a sentimental desire to indulge his
fancies in solitude a great change had come
over mr ricardo since that morning a whole
side of him which from prudence from neces-
sity from loyalty had been kept dormant
was aroused now coloring his thoughts and
disturbing his mental poise by the vision of
such staggering consequences as for instance
the possibility of an active conflict with his
governor

  the appearance of the monstrous pedro
with his news drew ricardo out of a feeling
of dreaminess wrapped up in a sense of im-
pending trouble a woman yes there was
one and it made all the difference

  after driving away pedro and watching the
white helmets of heyst and lena vanish
among the bushes he stood lost in meditation
where could they be off to like this he
mentally asked

  the answer found by his speculative facul-
ties on their utmost stretch was-to meet that
chink for in the desertion of wang ricardo
did not believe it was a lying yarn the
organic part of a dangerous plot heyst had
gone to combine some fresh move but then
ricardo felt sure that the girl was with him
-the girl full of pluck full of sense full of
understanding an ally of his own kind

  he went indoors briskly mr jones had
resumed his cross-legged pose at the head of
the bed with his back against the wall

   anything new

    no sir

  ricardo walked about the room as if he had
no care in the world he hummed snatches of
song mr jones raised his waspish eyebrows
at the sound the secretary got down on his
knees before an old leather trunk and rum-
maging in there brought out a small looking-
glass he fell to examining his physiognomy
in it with silent absorption

   i think ill shave he decided getting up

  he gave a sidelong glance at the governor
and repeated it several times during the
operation which did not take long and even
afterward when after putting away the imple-

ments he resumed his walking humming more
snatches of unknown songs mr jones pre-
served a complete immobility his thin lips
compressed his eyes veiled his face was like
a carving

   so you would like to try your hand at
cards with that skunk sir said ricardo stop-
ping suddenly and rubbing his hands

  mr jones gave no sign of having heard
anything

  well why not why shouldnt he have
the experience you remember in that mexi-
can town-whats its name-the robber fel-
low they caught in the mountains and con-
demned to be shot he played cards half the
night with the jailer and the sheriff well
this fellow is condemned too he must give
you your game hang it all a gentleman
ought to have some little relaxation and
you have been uncommonly patient sir

   you are uncommonly volatile all of a
sudden mr jones remarked in a bored voice
 whats come to you

  the secretary hummed for a whil and then
said

    try to get him over here for you to-
night after dinner if i aint here myself
dont you worry sir i shall be doing a bit
of nosing round-see

   i see sneered mr jones languidly
 but what do you expect to see in the dark

  ricardo made no answer and after another
turn or two slipped out of the room he
no longer felt comfortable alone with the
governor

xxxiv

  meantime heyst and lena walking rather
fast approached wangs hut asking the girl
to wait heyst ascended the little ladder of
bamboos giving access to the door

  it was as he had expected the smoky in-
terior was empty except for a big chest of
sandalwood too heavy for hurried removal
its lid was thrown up but whatever it might
have contained was no longer there all
wangs possessions were gone

  without tarrying in the hut heyst came
back to the girl who asked no questions with
her strange air of knowing nothing or under-
standing everything

   let us push on he said

  he went ahead the rustle of her white skirt
following him into the shades of the forest
along the path of their usual walk twice he
looked over his shoulder and smiled at her
behind the readiness of her answering smile
there was a fund of devoted concentrated pas-

sion burning with the hope of a more perfect
satisfaction

   they passed the spot where it was their
 practise to turn toward the barren summit of
  the central hill ileyst held steadily on his
 way toward the upper limit of the forest at
 the moment when they left its shelter a
  breeze enveloped them and a great cloud
 racing over the sun threw a peculiar somber
 tint over everything

   lena looked upward quickly as if surprised
 heyst pointed up a precipitous rugged path
 clinging to the side of the hill it ended in a
 barricade of felled trees a primitively con-
 ceived obstacle which must have cost much
 labor to erect at just that spot

    that heyst explained in his urbane tone
  is a barrier against the march of civilization
 the poor folk over there did not like it as it
 appeared to them in the shape of my com-
 pany-a great step forward as some people
 used to call it with mistaken confidence the
 advanced foot has been drawn back but the
 barricade remains

   they went on climbing slowly the cloud
 had driven over leaving an added brightness
 on the face of the world

    its a very ridiculous thing heyst went
 on but then it is the product of honest
 fear-fear of the unknown of the incompre-
 hensible its pathetic too in a way and i
 heartily wish lena that wre were on the other
 side of it

    oh stop stop she cried seizing his arm

   the face of the barricade they were ap-
 proaching had been piled up with a lot of
 fresh-cut branches the leaves were still
 green a gentle breeze sweeping over the
 top stirred them a little but what had startled
 the girl wras the discovery of three spear-blades
 protruding from the mass of foliage

    you had better let me go forward alone
 lena said heyst

   she tugged persistently at his arm but after
 a time during which he never ceased to look
 smilingly into her terrified eyes he ended by
 disengaging himself

    its a sign rather than a demonstration
 he remonstrated persuasively  just wait here
 a moment i promise not to approach near
 enough to be stabbed

   as in a nightmare she watched heyst go up
 the few yards of the path as if he never meant
 to stop and she heard his voice like voices
 heard in dreams shouting unknown words in
 an unearthly tone

   heyst was only demanding to see wang
 he was nt kept waiting very long recover-

 ing from the first flurry of her fright lena
 noticed a commotion in the green top-dressing
 ot the barricade she exhaled a sigh of relief
 when the spear-blades retreated out of sight
 sliding inward-the horrible things

  in a spot facing heyst a pair of yellow
hands parted the leaves and a face filled the
small opening-a face with very noticeable
eyes it was wangs face of course with no
suggestion of a body belonging to it like those
cardboard faces at which she remembered
gazing as a child in the window of a certain
dim shop kept by a mysterious little man in
kingsland road but this face instead of
mere holes had eyes which blinked she
could see the beating of the eyelids

  the hands on each side of the face keeping
the boughs apart also did not look as if they
belonged to any real body one of them was
holding a revolver-a weapon which she recog-
nized merely by intuition never having seen
such an object before

  she leaned her shoulders against the rock
of the perpendicular hillside and kept her eyes
on heyst with comparative composure since
the spears were not menacing him any longer
beyond the rigid and motionless back he pre-
sented to her she saw wangs unreal card-
board face moving its thin lips and grimacing
artificially she was too far down the path to
hear the dialogue carried on in an ordinary
voice

  she waited patiently for its end her shoul-
ders felt the warmth of the rock now and
then a whiff of cooler air seemed to slip down
upon her head from above the ravine at her
feet choked full of vegetation emitted the
faint drowsy hum of insect life everything
was very quiet

  she failed to notice the exact moment when
wangs head vanished from the foliage taking
the unreal hands away with it to her horror
the three spear-blades came gliding slowly out
i he very hair on her head stirred but before
she had time to cry out heyst who seemed
rooted to the ground turned round abruptly
and began to move toward her his great
mustache did not quite hide an ugly but ir-
resolute smile and when he had come down
near enough to touch her he burst out into
a harsh laugh

  ha ha ha

  she looked at him uncomprehending he
cut short his laugh and said curtly

   we had better go down as we came

  she followed him into the forest the ad-
vance of the afternoon had filled it with gloom
far away a slant of light between the trees
victory



closed the view all was dark beyond heyst
stopped

   no reason to hurry lena he said in his
ordinary serenely polite tones  we return
unsuccessful i suppose you know or at
least can guess what was my object in going
up there

  no i cant guess dear she said and
smiled noticing with emotion that his breast
was heaving as if he had been out of breath
nevertheless he tried to command his speech
pausing only a little between the words

  no i went up to find wang i went
up -he gasped again here but this was for
the last time- i made you come with me be-
cause i didnt like to leave you unprotected in
the proximity of those fellows suddenly he
snatched his cork helmet off his head and
dashed it on the ground no he cried
roughly  all this is too unreal altogether it
isnt to be borne i cant protect you i
havent the power

  he glared at her for a moment then
hastened after his hat which had bounded
away to some distance he came back look-
ing at her face which was very white

   i ought to beg your pardon for these
antics he said adjusting his hat  a move-
ment of childish petulance indeed i feel
very much like a child in my ignorance in my
powerlessness in my want of resource in
everything except in the dreadful conscious-
ness of some evil hanging over your head-
yours 

   its you they are after she murmured

   no doubt but unfortunately-

   unfortunately-what

   unfortunately i have not succeeded with
wang he said  i failed to move his
celestial heart-that is if there is such a
thing he told me with horrible chinese
reasonableness that he could not let us pass
the barrier because we should be pursued he
doesnt like fights he gave me to understand
that he would shoot me with my own revolver
without any sort of compunction rather than
risk a rude and distasteful contest with the
strange barbarians he has preached to the
villagers they respect him he is the most
remarkable man they have ever seen and
their kinsman by marriage we were talking
in such malay as we are both equal to

   your fears are foolish i said

   foolish of course i am foolish he re-
plied  if i were a wise man i should be a
merchant with a big hong in singapore in-
stead of being mine-coolie turned house-boy
but if you dont go away in time i will shoot

you before it growrs too dark to take aim not
till then number one but i will do it then
now-finish

     all right i said  finish as far as i am
concerned but you can have no objections to
the mem putih coming over to stay with the
orang kayas women for a few days i will
make a present in silver for it orang kava
is the head man of the village lena added
heyst

  she looked af him in astonishment

   you wanted me to go to that village of
savages she gasped as if her breath had
failed her  you wanted me to leave you
 it would have given me a freer hand
heyst stretched out his hands and looked at
them for a moment then let them fall by his
sides indignation was expressed more in the
curve of her lips than in her clear eyes which
never wavered

   i believe wang laughed he went on
 he made a noise like a turkey-cock

    that would be worse than anything he
said

   i was taken aback i pointed out to him
that he was talking nonsense it could not
make any difference to his security where you
were because the evil men as he calls them
did not know of your existence i did not
lie exactly lena though i did stretch the
truth till it cracked but the fellow seems to
have an uncanny insight he shook his head
he assured me they knew all about you he
made a horrible grimace at me

    it doesnt matter said the girl  i didnt
want-i would not have gone

  heyst raised his eyes

  wonderful intuition as i continued to
press him wang made that very remark about
you when he smiles his face looks like a
conceited deaths-head it was his very last
remark-that you wouldnt want to i went
away then

  she leaned back against a tree heyst faced
her in the same attitude of leisure as if they
had done with time and all the other con-
cerns of the earth suddenly high above their
heads the roof of leaves whispered at them
tumultuously and then ceased

   that was a strange notion of yours to
send me away she said  send me away
what for yes what for

   you seem indignant he remarked list-
lessly

  to these savages too she pursued
 and you think i would have gone you can
do what you like with me-but not that not
that


muxseys magazine

  heyst looked into the dim aisles of the
forest everything was so still now that the
very ground on which they stood seemed to
exhale silence into the shade

   why be indignant he said  it has not
happened i gave up pleading with wang
here wre are repulsed xot only without
power to resist the evil but unable to make
terms for ourselves with the worthy envoys
the envoys extraordinary of the world we
thought we had done with for years and years
 have neither strength nor persuasion and the
most bitter part of this humiliation is its com-
plete uselessness-which i feel i feel

  she had never before seen him give such
signs of feeling across his ghastly face the
long mustache flamed in the shade he spoke
suddenly

   i wonder if i could find enough courage to
creep among them in the night with a knife
and cut their throats one after another as
they slept i wonder-

  she was frightened by his unwonted ap-
pearance more than by the wrords in his
mouth and said earnestly

   dont you try to do such a thing dont
you think of it

   i dont possess anything bigger than a
penknife as to thinking of it lena theres
no saying what one may think of i dont
think something in me thinks-something
foreign to my nature what is the matter
he noticed her suddenly parted lips and
the peculiar stare in her eyes which had
w-andered from his face

   theres somebody after us i saw some-
thing white moving she cried

  heyst did not turn his head he only glanced
at her outstretched arm

 no doubt we are followed we are
watched

   i dont see anything now she said

   and it does not matter heyst went on in
his ordinary voice  here we are in the
frest but can we wander among these big
trees indefinitely is this a reluge no
what else is left to us i did think for a
moment of the mine but even there we could
not remain very long and then that gallery
is not safe the props were too weak to be-
gin with ants have been at work there-
ants after the men a death-trap at best
one can die but once but there are many
manners of death

  the girl glanced about fearfully in search
of the watcher or follower whom she had
glimpsed once among the trees but if he ex-
isted he had concealed himself nothing met

her eyes but the deepening shadows of the
short vistas between the living columns pf the
still roof of leaves she looked at the man
beside her expectantly tenderly with sup-
pressed affright and a sort of awed wonder

   i have also thought of these peoples
boat heyst went on we could get into
that and-only they have taken everything
out of her i have seen her oars and sail in
the corner of their room to get in and shove
off in an empty boat would be nothing but a
desperate expedient supposing even that she
would drift out a good distance between the
islands before the morning it would only be
a complicated manner of committing suicide
-to be found dead in a boat dead from sun
and thirst a sea mystery i wonder who
would find us davidson perhaps but
davidson went westward ten days ago i
watched him steaming past one early morn-
ing from the jetty

   you never told me she said

   he must have been looking at me through
his big binoculars perhaps if i had raised
my arm-but what did we want writh david-
son then you and i he wont be back this
way for three weeks or more lena i wish i
had raised my arm that morning

  what would have been the good of it
she sighed

  what good no good of course we
had no forebodings this seemed to be an
inexpugnable refuge where we could live un-
troubled and learn to know each other

   its perhaps in trouble that people get to
know each other she suggested

   perhaps he said indifferently  at any
rate we would not have gone away from here
with him though i believe he would have
come in eagerly enough and ready for any
service he could render its that fat mans
nature-a delightful fellow

  he raised his head after a silence

  how gloomy this forest has grown yet
surely the sun cannot have set already

  she looked round and as if her eyes had
just been opened she perceived the shades of
the forest surrounding her not so much with
gloom but with a sullen dumb cold and
menacing hostility her heart sank in the en-
gulfing stillness at that moment she felt the
nearness of death breathing on her and on the
man with her if there had been a sudden
stir of leaves the crack of a dry branch the
faintest rustle she would have screamed aloud

  but she shook off the unworthy weakness
such as she was a fiddle-scraping girl picked
up on the very threshold of infamy she would
victory



try to rise above herself triumphant and
hurtible and then happiness would burst on
her like a torrent flinging at her feet the man
whom she loved

  heyst stirred slightly

   we had better be getting back lena since
we cant stay all night in the woods-or any-
where else for that matter we are the slaves
of this infernal surprise which had been sprung
on us by-shall i say fate-your fate or
mine

  it was the man who had broken the silence
but it was the woman who led the way at
the very edge of the forest she stopped con-
cealed by a tree he joined her cautiously

   what is it what do you see lena he
whispered

  she said that it was only a thought that had
come into her head she hesitated for a mo-
ment giving him over her shoulder a shining
gleam of her gray eyes she wanted to know
whether this trouble this danger this evil
whatever it was finding them out in their re-
treat was not a sort of punishment

   punishment repeated heyst he could
not understand what she meant when she
explained he was still more surprised  a
sort of retribution from an angry heaven
he said in wonder on us what for

  he saw her pale face darken in- the dusk
she had blushed her whispering flowed very
fast it was the way they lived together-
that wasnt right was it it was a guilty life
for she had not been forced into it driven
scared into it no no-she had come to him
of her own free will with her whole soul
yearning unlawfully

  he was so profoundly touched that he could
not speak for a moment to conceal his
trouble he assumed his best heystian manner

   what are our visitors then messengers
of morality avengers of righteousness agents
of providence thats certainly an original
view how flattered they would be if they
could hear you

   now you are making fun of me she said
in a subdued voice which broke suddenly

  are you conscious of sin heyst asked
gravely she made no answer for i am
not he added before heaven i am not

  you you are different woman is the
tempter you took me up from pity i threw
myself at you

   oh you exaggerate you exaggerate it
was not so bad as that he said playfully
keeping his voice steady with an effort

  he considered himself a dead man already
yet forced to pretend that he was alive for her

sake for her defense he regretted that he
had no heaven to which he could recommend
this fair palpitating handful of ashes and dust
-warm living sentient his own - and ex-
posed helplessly to insult outrage degrada-
tion and infinite misery of the body

  she had averted her face from him and was
still he suddenly seized her passive hand

  you will have it so he said yes
well let us then hope lor mercy together

  she shook her head without looking at him
like an abashed child

  before their eyes the bungalow across the
cleared ground stood bathed in a sinister light
an unexpected chill gust of wind made a noise
in the tree-tops she snatched her hand away
and stepped out into the open but before she
had advanced more than three yards she
stood still and pointed to the west

  oh look there she exclaimed

  beyond the headland of black diamond bay
lying black on a purple sea great masses of
cloud stood piled up above the sunset bathed
in a mist of blood a crimson crack like an
open wound zigzagged between them with a
piece of dark-red sun showing at the bottom
heyst cast an indifferent glance at the ill-
omened chaos of the sky

   thunder-storm making up we shall hear
it all night but it wont visit us probably
the clouds generally gather round the vol-
cano

  she was not listening to him her eyes re-
flected the somber and violent hues of the
sunset

   that does not look much like a sign of
mercy she said slowly as if to herself and
hurried on followed by heyst suddenly she
stopped  i dont care i wrould do more
yet and some day youll forgive me youll
have to forgive me

xxxv

  stumbling up the steps as if suddenly ex-
hausted lena entered the room and let her-
self fall on the nearest chair

  before following her heyst took a survey
of the surroundings from the veranda it was
a complete solitude there was nothing in
the aspect of this familiar scene to tell him
that he and the girl were not as completely
alone as they had been in the early days of
their common life on this abandoned spot with
only wang discreetly materializing from time
to time and the uncomplaining memory of
morrison to keep them company

  after the cold gust of wind there was an
absolute stillness of the air a sluggish shift-


muxseys

magazine

ing of murky vapors had filled the crimson
crack in the body of clouds and the thunder-
charged mass hung unbroken beyond the low
ink-black headland darkening the twilight
by contrast the sky at the zenith had a pel-
lucid clearness the sheen of a delicate glass
bubble which the merest movement of air
might shatter

  a little to the left between the black masses
of the headland and of the forest the volcano
a feather of smoke by day and a cigar-glow at
night took its first fiery expanding breath of
the evening above it a reddish star came out
like an expelled spark from the fiery bosom
of the earth enchanted into permanency by
the mysterious spell of frozen spaces

  in front of heyst the forest already full of
the deepest shades stood like a wall but he
lingered watching its edge especially where it
ended at the line of bushes masking the land
end of the jetty

  since the girl had spqken of catching a
glimpse of something white among the trees
he believed pretty firmly that they had been
followed in their excursion up the mountain
by mr joness secretary no doubt the fel-
low had watched them out of the forest and
now unless he took the trouble to go back
some distance and fetch a considerable cir-
cuit inland over the clearing he was bound to
walk out into the open space before the bunga-
lows heyst did indeed imagine at one time
some movement between the trees lost as
soon as perceived he stared patiently but
nothing more happened

  after all why should he trouble about these
peoples actions why this stupid concern for
the preliminaries since when the issue was
joined it would find him disarmed and shrink-
ing from the ugliness and degradation of it

  he turned and entered the room deep
dusk reigned in there already lena near the
door did not move or speak the sheen of
the white table-cloth was very obtrusive the
brute that these two vagabonds had tamed had
entered on its service while heyst and lena
were away the table was laid

  heyst walked up and down the room several
times the girl remained without sound or
movement on the chair as if she had been
blind dumb dead but when heyst busied
himself in placing the two silver candelabra
on the table and struck a match to light the
candles she got up suddenly and went into
the bedroom

  she came out again almost immediately
having taken off her hat heyst looked at her
over his shoulder

   whats the good of shirking the evil hour 
ive lighted these candles for a sign of our
return after all we might not have been
watched-while returning i mean of course
we were seen leaving the house

  the girl sat down again the great wealth
of her hair looked very dark above her color-
less face she raised her eyes without ex-
pression glistening softly in the light with a
sort of unreadable appeal with a strange
effect of unseeing innocence

   yes said heyst across the table the fin-
ger-tips of one hand resting on the immacu-
late cloth  a creature with an antediluvian
lower jaw hairy like a mastodon and formed
like a prehistoric ape has laid this table are
you awake lena am i i would pinch
myself only i know that nothing would do
away with this dream three covers you
know it is the shorter of the two whos com-
ing-the gentleman who in the play of his
shoulders as he walks and in his facial struc-
ture recalls a jaguar ah you dont know
what a jaguar is but you have had a good
look at these two its the short one you
know whos to be our guest

  she made a sign with her head that she
knew heysts insistence brought ricardo
vividly before her mental vision a sudden
languor like the physical echo of her struggle
with the man paralyzed all her limbs

  heyst had started to pace the room

   our guest there is a proverb-in rus-
sia i believe-that when a guest enters the
house god enters the house the sacred vir-
tue of hospitality but it leads one into
trouble as well as any other

  the girl unexpectedly got up from the chair
swaying her supple figure and stretching her
arms above her head he stopped to look at
her curiously paused and then went on

   i venture to think that god has nothing
to do with such a hospitality and with such a
guest

  she had jumped to her feet to react against
the numbness to discover whether her body
would obey her will it did she could stand
up and she could move her arms freely
though no physiologist she concluded that all
that sudden numbness was in her head not in
her limbs her fears assuaged she thanked
god for it mentally and to heyst murmured
a protest

  oh yes hes got to do with everything
-every little thing nothing can happen-

   yes he said hastily  one of the two
sparrows cant be struck to the ground-you
are thinking of that the habitual playful
victory



smile faded on the kindly lips under the
martial mustache  ah you remember what
you have been told-as a child-on sundays
 yes i do remember she sank into the
chair again  it was the only decent bit of
time i ever had when i was a kid with our
landladys two girls you know

    i wonder lena heyst said with a return
 of his urbane playfulness whether you are
 just a little child or whether you represent
 something as old as the world

   she surprised heyst by saying dreamily

    well-and what about you

   i i date later-much later i cant call
 myself a child but i am so recent that i may
 call myself a man of the last hour-or is it
 the hour before last i have been out of it
 so long that i am not certain how far the
 hands of the clock have moved since-
 since-

    he glanced at the portrait of his father ex-
 actly above the head of the girl and as it
 were ignoring her in its painted austerity of
 feeling he did not finish the sentence but
 he did not remain silent for long

    only what must be avoided are fallacious
 inferences my dear lena-especially at this
 hour

    now you are making fun of me again
 she said without looking up

   am i he cried making fun no
 giving warning hang it all whatever truth
 people told you in the old days there is also
 this one-that sparrows do fall to the ground
 that they are brought down to the ground
 this is no vain assertion but a fact thats
 why  - again his tone changed while he
 picked up a table-knife and let it fall dis-
 dainfully  thats why i wish these wretched
 round knives had some edge on them abso-
 lute rubbish - neither edge point nor sub-
 stance i believe one of these forks would
 make a better weapon at a pinch but can
 i go about with a fork in my pocket he
 gnashed his teeth with a rage very real and
 yet comic

    there used to be a carver here but it
 was broken and thrown away a long time ago
 nothing much to carve here it would have
 made a noble weapon no doubt but-

 he stopped the girl sat very quiet with
 downcast eyes as he kept silent for some
 time she looked up and said thoughtfully

  yes a knife-its a knife that you would
 want wouldnt you in case in case-

 he shrugged his shoulders

  there must be a crowbar or two in the
 sheds but i have given up all the keys to-

 gether and then do you see me walking
 about with a crowbar in my hand ha ha
 and besides that edifying sight alone might
 start the trouble for all i know in truth
 why has it not started yet

     perhaps they are afraid of you she whis-
 pered looking down again

      by jove it looks like it he assented
 meditatively  they do seem to hang back
 tor some reason is that reason prudence or
 downright fear or perhaps the leisurely
 method of certitude

   out in the black night not very far from
 the bungalow resounded a loud and prolonged
 whistle lenas hands grasped the arms of the
 chair but she made no movement heyst
 started then shrugged his shoulders and turned
 his face away from the door

    the startling sound had died away

     whistles yells omens signals portents-
 what do they matter he said  but what
 about that crowbar suppose i had it could
 i stand in ambush at the side of the door-
 this door and smash the first protruding head
 scatter blood and brains over the floor over
 these walls and then run stealthily to the
 other door to do the same thing-and repeat
 the performance for a third time perhaps
 could i

   no no she whispered ardently as if
 compelled to speak by his eyes fixed on her
 face  no its a knife you want to defend
 yoursell with -to defend -there will be
 time-

   and who knows if it isnt really my
 duty he began again as if he had not heard
 her disjointed words at all it may be-
 my duty to you to myself for why should
 i endure the humiliation of their menaces
 do you know what the world would say

   he emitted a low laugh which struck her
 with terror she would have got up but he
 stooped so low over her that she could not
 move without first pushing him away

    it would say lena that i-that swede-
 after luring my friend and partner to his
 death from mere greed of money have mur-
 dered these unoffending shipwrecked strangers
 from sheer funk that would be the story
 whispered-perhaps shouted-certainly spread
 out and believed-and believed my dear
 lena

  who would believe such awful things

  perhaps you wouldnt-not at first at any
 rate but the power of calumny grows with
 time its insidious and penetrating it can
 even destroy ones faith in oneself-drv-rot
 the soul


munseys magazine

  all at once her eyes leaped to the door and
remained fixed stony a little enlarged  um-
ing his head heyst beheld the figure ot ri-
cardo framed in the doorway

  for a moment neither of the three moved
then as if awaking from his astonishment
looking from the newcomer to the girl in the
chair heyst formulated a sardonic but soft
introduction 

  ah this is mr ricardo my dear

  her head drooped a little ricardos hand
went up to his mustache as if to give it a
twirl his voice seemed to explode in the
room

   at your service maam

  he stepped in taking his hat off with a
flourish and dropping it carelessly on a chair
near the door

   at your service he repeated in quite an-
other tone  i was made aware there was a
lady about by that pedro of ours only 
didnt know  should have the privilege of see-
ing you to-night maam

  lena and heyst looked at him rather cov-
ertly but he with a vague gaze avoiding them
both looked at nothing seeming to pursue
some point in space

   had a pleasant walk he asked suddenly
 yes and you- returned heyst who had
managed to catch his glance

  i i havent been a yard away from the
governor this afternoon till i started for here
the genuineness of the accent surprised heyst
without convincing him of the truth of the
words why do you ask pursued ricardo
with every inflection of perfect candor

   you might have wished to explore the
island a little said heyst studying the man
who to render him justice did not try to free
his captured gaze  i may remind you that it
wouldnt be a perfectly safe proceeding
ricardo presented a picture of innocence

   oh yes-meaning that chink that has run
away from you he aint much

   he has a revolver observed heyst mean-
ingly

   well and you have a revolver too mr
ricardo argued unexpectedly  i dont worn
myself about that

   i thats different i am not afraid of
you heyst made answer after a short pause
 of me

   of all of you

   you have a queer way of putting things
began ricardo

  at that moment the door on the compound
side of the house came open with some noise
and pedro entered pressing the edge of a

loaded tray to his breast his big hairy
nead rolled a little his feet fell in front of
each other with a short hard thump on the
floor the arrival changed the current of
ricardos thought perhaps but certainly of
his speech

   you heard me whistling a little while ago
outside that was to give him a hint as i
came along that it was time to bring in the
dinner and here he is

  lena rose and passed to the right of ricar-
do who lowered his glance for a moment
they sat down at the table the enormous
gorilla back of pedro swayed out through the
door

   extraordinary strong brute maam said
ricardo he had a propensity to talk about
his pedro as some men will talk of their
dogs  he aint pretty though no he aint
pretty and he has got to be kept under i
am his keeper as it might be the governor
dont trouble his head much about dee-tails
all thats left to martin martin thats me
maam

  heyst saw the girls eyes turn toward mr
joness secretary and rest blankly on his face
ricardo however looked vaguely into space
and with faint flickers of a smile about his
lips made conversation indefatigably against
the silence of his entertainers

  he boasted largely of his long association
with mr jones-over four years now he said
then glancing rapidly at heyst

   you can see at once hes a gentleman
cant you

   you people heyst said his habitual play-
ful intonation tinged with gloom  are di-
vorced from all reality in my eyes

  ricardo received this speech as if he had
been expecting to hear those very words or
else did not mind at all what heyst might say
he muttered an absent-minded  aye aye
played with a bit of biscuit sighed and said
with a peculiar stare which did not seem to
carry any distance but to stop short at a
point in the air very near his face

  anybody can see at once you are one
you and the governor ought to understand
each other he expects to see you to-night
the governor isnt well and weve got to
think of getting away from here

  while saying these words he turned him-
self full toward lena but without any marked
expression leaning back with folded arms
the girl stared before her as if she had been
alone in the room

   really thinking of going away from
here heyst murmured
victory



  the best of friends must part ricardo
pronounced slowly  and as long as they
part friends theres no harm done we two
are used to being on the move you  under-
stand prefer to stick in one place

  it was obvious that all this was being said
merely for the sake of talking and that ri-
cardos mind was concentrated on some pur-
pose unconnected with the words that were
coming out of his mouth

    should like to know heyst asked with
incisive politeness  how you have come to
understand this or anything else about me
as far as i can remember ive made you no
confidences

  ricardo gazing comfortably into space out
of the back of his chair-for some time all
three had given up any pretense of eating-
answered abstractedly

  any fellow might have guessed it he
sat up suddenly and uncovered all his teeth
in a grin of extraordinary ferocity which was
belied by the penitent amiability of his tone
the governor will be the man to tell you
something about that i wish you would say
you would see my governor hes the one who
does all our talking let me take you to him
this evening he aint at all well and he
cant make up his mind to go away without
having a talk with you

  heyst looking up met lenas eyes their
expression of candor seemed to hide some
struggling intention her head he fancied
had made an imperceptible affirmative move-
ment why what reason could she have
was it the prompting of some obscure in-
stinct or was it simply a delusion of his
own senses

   well suppose i do say so

  ricardo did not conceal his satisfaction
which for a moment interested heyst

   it cant be my life they are after he
said to himself  what good could it be to
them

  he looked across the table at the girl
what did it matter whether she had nodded
or not as always when looking into her
unconscious eyes he tasted something like the
dregs of tender pity he had decided to go
her nod imaginary or not imaginary advice
or illusion had tipped the scale

  he reflected that ricardos invitation could
scarcely be anything in the nature of a trap
it would have been too superfluous why car-
ry subtly into a trap some one already bound
hand and foot as it were

  all this time he had been looking fixedly at
the girl he called lena in the submissive


quietness of her being which had been her
attitude ever since they had begun their life
on the island she remained as secret as ever

  heyst got up briskly with a smile of such
enigmatic and despairing character that mr
secretary ricardo whose abstract gaze had an
all-round efficiency made a slight crouching
start as if to dive under the table tor his
leg-knife-a start that was repressed as soon
as begun

  he had expected heyst to spring on him or
draw a revolver because he created for him-
self a vision of life in his own image instead
of doing either of these evident things heyst
walked across the room opened the door and
put his head through it to look out into the
compound

  as soon as his back was turned ricardos
hand sought the girls arm under the table
he was not looking at her but she felt the
groping nervous touch of his search felt sud-
denly the grip of his fingers above her wrist
he leaned forward a little still he dared not
look at her his hard stare remained fastened
on heysts back

  in an extremely low hiss his fixed idea of
argument found expression scathingly

   see hes no good thats not the man
for you

  he glanced at her at last her lips moved
a little and he was awed by that movement
without a sound next instant the hard grasp
of his fingers vanished from her arm

  heyst had shut the door on his way back
to the table he crossed the path of the girl
they had called alma-she didnt know why-
also magdalen but whose mind had remained
so long in doubt as to the reason of her own
existence she no longer wondered at that
bitter riddle since her heart had found its so-
lution in a blinding hot glow of passionate
purpose

xxxvi

  she passed by heyst as if she had indeed
been blinded by some secret lurid and con-
suming glare into which she was about to
enter the heavy curtain of the bedroom door
fell behind her into rigid folds ricardos va-
cant gaze seemed to be watching the dancing
flight of a fly in mid air

 extra dark outside aint it he muttered

   not so dark but that i could see that man
of yours prowling about there said heyst in
measured tones

   what-pedro hes scarcely a man you
know or else i wouldnt be so fond of him as
i am


munseys magazine

   very well lets call him your worthy
associate

  aye worthy enough for what we want
of him a great standby is pedro in a scrim-
mage a growl and a bite-oh my and
you dont want him about

   i dont

   you want him out of the way insisted
ricardo with an affectation of incredulity
which heyst accepted calmly though the air
in the room seemed to grow more oppressive
with every word spoken

   thats it i do want him out of the
way he forced himself to speak equably

  lor thats no great matter pedros
not much use here the business my gov-
ernors after can be settled by ten minutes
rational talk with-with another gentleman
quiet talk

  he looked up suddenly with hard phosphor-
escent eyes heyst didnt move a muscle
ricardo congratulated himself on having left
his revolver behind he was so exasperated
that he didnt know what he might have done
he said at last

   you want poor harmless pedro out of the
way before you let me take you to see the
governor-is that it

   yes that is it

   h-m one can see ricardo said with
hidden venom that you are a gentleman
but all that gentlemanly fancifulness is apt to
turn sour on a plain mans stomach how-
ever-youll have to pardon me

  he put his fingers into his mouth and let
out a whistle which seemed to drive a thin
sharp shaft of air solidly against ones nearest
ear-drum though he greatly enjoyed heysts
involuntary grimace he sat perfectly stolid
waiting for the effect of the call

  it brought pedro in with an extraordinary
uncouth primeval impetuosity the door flew
open with a clatter and the wild figure it dis-
closed seemed anxious to devastate the room
in a couple of whirls and bounds but ricardo
raised his open palm and the creature came in
quietly his enormous half-closed paws swung
to and fro a little in front of his bowed trunk
as he walked ricardo looked on truculently
go to the boat-understand go now
the little red eyes of the tame monster
blinked with painful attention in the mass of
hair

  well why dont you get forgot hu-
man speech eh dont you know any longer
what a boat is

   si - boat the creature stammered out
doubtfully

   well go there-the boat at the jetty
march off to it and sit there lay down there
do anything but go to sleep there-till you 
hear my call and then fly here thems your
orders march get vamose i no not that
way-out through the front door and mind
you no sulks

  pedro obeyed with uncouth alacrity when
he had gone the gleam of pitiless savagery
went out of ricardos yellow eyes and his
physiognomy took on for the first time that
evening the expression of a domestic cat
which is being noticed

   you can watch him right into the bushes
if you like too dark eh why not go with
him to the very spot then

  heyst made a gesture of vague protest

   theres nothing to assure me that he will
stay there i have no doubt of his going
but its an act without a guarantee

  there you are ricardo shrugged his
shoulders philosophically  cant be helped
short of shooting our pedro nobody can make
absolutely sure of his staying in the same
place longer than he has a mind to but i tell
you he lives in holy terror of my temper
thats why i put on my sudden-death air when
i talk to him and yet i wouldnt shoot him
-not i unless in such a fit of rage as would
make a man shoot his favorite dog look
here sir this deal is on the square i
didnt tip him a wink to do anything else he
wont budge from the jetty are you coming
along now sir

  a short silence ensued ricardos jaws were
working ominously under his skin his eyes
glided voluptuously here and there cruel and
dreamy heyst checked a sudden movement
reflected for a while then said

   you must wait a little

  wait a little wait a little what does
he think a fellow is-a graven image grum-
bled ricardo half audibly

  heyst went into the bedroom and shut the
door after him with a bang coming from the
light he could not see a thing in there at
first yet he received the impression of the girl
getting up from the floor on the less opaque
darkness of the shutter-hole her head de-
tached itself suddenly very faint a mere hint
of a round dark shape without a face

   i am going lena i am going to face
those scoundrels he was surprised to feel
two arms falling on his shoulders  i thought
that you- he began

  yes yes the girl whispered hastily

  she neither clung to him nor yet did she
try to draw him to her her hands grasped
victory



his shoulders and she seemed to him to be
staring into his tace in the dark

   and now he could see something of her face
too -an oval without features -and faintly
distinguish her person a something lighter in
the blackness a form without definite lines

    you have a black dress here havent you
lena he asked speaking rapidly and so low
that she could just hear him

    yes-an old thing

    very good put it on at once

   but why

  not for mourning there was some-
thing peremptory in the slightly ironic mur-
mur  can you find it and get into it in the
dark

   she could she would try he waited very
still he could imagine her movements over
there at the far end of the room but his eyes
accustomed now to the darkness had lost her
completely when she spoke her voice sur-
prised him by its nearness she had done
what he had told her to do and had ap-
proached him invisible

    good wheres that piece of purple veil
ive seen lying about he asked

   there was no answer only a slight rustle

   where is it he repeated impatiently

  her unexpected breath was on his cheek

    in my hands

   capital listen lena as soon as i
leave the bungalow with that horrible scoun-
drel you slip out at the back-instantly lose
no time - and run round into the forest
that will be your time while we are walking
away and i can be sure he wont give me the
slip run into the forest behind the fringe of
bushes between the big trees you will know
surely how to find a place in full view of the
front door i fear for you but in this black
dress with most of your face muffled up in
that dark veil i defy anybody to find you
there before daylight wait in the forest till
the table is pushed into full view of the door-
way and you see three candles out of four
blown out and one relighted-or should the
lights be put out here while you watch them
wait till three candles are lighted and then two
put out at either of these signals run back
as hard as you can for it will mean that i
am waiting for you here

   while he was speaking the girl had sought
and seized one of his hands she did not press
it she held it loosely as it were timidly
caressingly it was no grasp it was a mere
contact as if only to make sure that he was
there that he was real and no mere darker
shadow in the obscurity

  the warmth of her hand gave heyst a
strange intimate sensation of all her person
he had to fight down a new sort of emotion
which almost unmanned him he went on
whispering sternly

    but if you see no such signals dont let
 anything-fear curiosity despair or hope-
 entice you back to this house and with the
 first sign of the dawn steal away along the
 edge of the clearing till you strike the path
 wait no longer because i shall probably be
 dead

   the murmur of the word  never floated
into his ear as if it had formed itself in the
air

   you know the path he continued
make your way to the barricade go to
wang-yes to wang let nothing stop you
it seemed to him that the girls hand trem-
bled a little  the worst he can do to you is
to shoot you but he wont i really think he
wont if i am not there stay with the vil-
lagers with the wild people and fear nothing
t hey will be more awed by you than you can
be frightened of them davidsons bound to
turn up before very long keep a lookout for
a steamer passing think of some sort of
signal to call him

  she made no answer the sense of the
heavy brooding silence in the outside world
seemed to enter and fill the room-the op-
pressive infinity of it without breath without
light it was as if the heart of hearts had
ceased to beat and the end of all things had
come

   have you understood you are to run
out of the house at once heyst whispered
urgently

   she swiftly lifted his hand to her lips and
 let it go he was startled

   lena he cried out under his breath

   she was gone from his side he dared not
trust himself-no not even to the extent of a
tender word

   turning to go out he heard a thud some-
where in the house to open the door he had
first to lift the curtain he did so with his
face over his shoulder the merest trickle
of light coming through the keyhole and one
or two cracks was enough for his eyes to see
her plainly all black down on her knees with
her head and arms flung on the foot of the
bed-all black in the desolation of a mourning
sinner

   what was this a suspicion that there were
everywhere more things than he could under-
stand crossed heysts mind her arm de-
tached from the bed motioned him away he

 obeyed without protest and went out full of
 disquiet

  the curtain behind him had not ceased to
tremble when she was up on her feet close
against it listening for sounds for words in
a stooping tragic attitude of stealthy atten-
tion one hand clutching at her breast as if to
compress to make less loud the beating of her
heart

  heyst had caught mr joness secretary in
the contemplation of his closed writing-desk
ricardo might have been meditating how to
break into it but when he turned about sud-
denly he showed so distorted a face that it
made heyst pause in wonder at the upturned
whites of the eyes which were blinking hor-
ribly as if the man were inwardly convulsed

   i thought you were never coming ri-
cardo mumbled

   i didnt know you were pressed for time
even if your going away depends on this con-
versation as you say i doubt if you are the
men to put to sea on such a night as this
said heyst motioning ricardo to precede him
out of the house

  with feline undulations of hip and shoulder
the secretary left the room at once there
was something cruel in the absolute dumbness
of the night the great cloud covering half
the sky seemed to hang right against one like
an enormous curtain hiding menacing prepa-
rations of violence as the feet of the two
men touched the ground a distant rumble
came from behind the cloud preceded by a
swift mysterious gleam of light on the waters
of the bay

  ha said ricardo it begins

   it may be nothing in the end observed
heyst stepping along steadily

  no let it come ricardo said to him-
self viciously i am in the humor for it

  by the time the two men had reached the
other bungalow the far-off modulated rumble
was growling almost incessantly while pale
lightning in waves of cold fire flooded and
ran off the island time after time in rapid
succession ricardo unexpectedly dashed
ahead up the steps and put his head through
the door

   here he is governor keep him witoh you
as long as you can-till you hear me whistle

i am on the track

  he flung these words into the room with
inconceivable speed and stood aside to let the
visitor pass through the doorway but he had
to wait an appreciable moment because the
other man seeing his purpose had scornfully
slowed his pace

  when heyst entered the room it was with a
smile the heyst smile lurking under his
martial mustache

  two candles were burning on the stand-up
desk mr jones tightly infolded in an old
but gorgeous silk dressing-gown kept his el-
bows close against his sides and his hands
deeply plunged into the extraordinarily deep
pockets of the garment the costume ac-
centuated his emaciation he greatly resem-
bled a painted pole leaning against the edge
of the desk with a dried head of dubious dis-
tinction stuck on the top of it

  ricardo lounged in the doorway indiffer-
ent in appearance to what was going on he
was biding his time at a given moment be-
tween two flickers of lightning he melted out
of his frame into the outer air

  his disappearance was observed on the in-
stant by mr jones who abandoned his non-
chalant immobility against the desk and made
a few steps calculated to put himself between
heyst and the doorway

    its awfully close he remarked

  heyst in the middle of the room had made
up his mind to speak plainly

    we havent met to talk about the weather
you favored me earlier in the day with a
rather cryptic phrase about yourself  i am
he that is you said what docs that mean

  mr jones without looking at heyst con-
tinued his absent-minded movements till at-
taining the desired position he brought his
shoulders with a thump against the wall near
the door and raised his head in the emotion
of the decisive moment his haggard face
glistened with perspiration drops ran down
his hollow cheeks and almost blinded the
spectral eyes in their bony caverns

   it means that i am a person to be
reckoned with no-stop dont put your
hand in your pocket-dont

   his voice had a wild unexpected shrillness
heyst started and there ensued a moment of
suspended animation during which the thun-
ders deep bass muttered distantly and the
doorway to the right of mr jones flickered
with bluish light

  at last heyst shrugged his shoulders he
even looked at his hand he didnt put it in
his pocket however mr jones glued against
the wall watched him raise both his hands to
the ends of his mustache and answered the
note of interrogation in his steady eyes

   a matter of prudence said mr jones in
his naturally hollow tones and with a face of
victory



 deathlike composure a man of your free
 life has surely perceived that though as far
 as i understand-you are a much-talked-about
 man mr heyst-as far as i understand you
 are accustomed to employ the subtler weapons
 of intelligence still i cant afford to take any
 risk of the-er-grosser methods i am not
 unscrupulous enough to be a match for you
 in the use of intelligence but i assure you
 mr heyst that in the other way you are no
 match for me i have you covered at this
 very moment you have been covered ever
 since you entered this room yes-from my
 pocket

   during this harangue heyst looked de-
 liberately over his shoulder stepped back a
 pace and sat down on the end of the camp
 bedstead leaning his elbow on one knee he
 laid his cheek in the palm of his hand and
 seemed to meditate on what he should say
 next

    mr jones planted against the wall was ob-
  viously waiting for some sort of overture as
  nothing came he resolved to speak himself
  but he hesitated for though he considered
  that the most difficult step had been taken
  he said to himself that every stage of progress
  required great caution lest the man in ri-
  cardos phraseology should  start to prance 
  -which would be most inconvenient he fell
  back on a previous statement

     and i am a person to be reckoned with
  the other man went on looking at the floor
  as if he were alone in the room there was a
  pause

   you have heard of me then heyst said
  at length looking up

    i should think so we have been staying
  at schombergs hotel

   schom- heyst choked on the word

   whats the matter mr heyst

   nothing nausea heyst said resignedly
he resumed his former attitude of meditative
indifference  what is this reckoning you are
talking about he asked after a time in the
quietest possible tone  i dont know you

    it s obvious that we belong to the same-
social sphere began mr jones with languid
irony inwardly he was as watchful as he
could be  something has driven you out-
the originality of your ideas perhaps it was
the case with me and i wasnt going to go to
prison for it and weep publicly over my sins
mr jones indulged in one of his ghastly
smiles in repose his features had a curious
character of evil exhausted austerity but
when he smiled the whole mask took on an
unpleasantly infantile expression a recrudes-

cence of the rolling thunder invaded the room
loudly and passed into silence

      you are not taking this very well ob-
 served mr jones this was what he said
 but as a matter of fact he thought that the
 business was shaping quite satisfactorily the
 man he said to himself had no stomach for
 a fight aloud he continued come you
 can t expect to have it always your own wray
 you are a man of the world

    and you heyst interrupted him unex-
 pectedly  how do you define yourself

    i my dear sir in one way i am-yes
 i am the world itself come to pay you a visit
 in another sense i am an outcast-almost an
 outlaw if you prefer a less materialistic
 view i am a sort of fate-the retribution that
 waits its time

    i wish to goodness you were the com-
 monest sort of ruffian said heyst raising his
 equable gaze to mr jones  one would be
 able to talk to you straight then and hope
 for some humanity as it is-

     i dislike violence and ferocity of every
 sort as much as you do mr jones declared
 looking very languid as he leaned against the
 wall but speaking fairly loud  you can ask
 my martin if it is not so this mr heyst
 is a soft age it is also an age without
 prejudices ive heard that you are free from
 them yourself you mustnt be shocked if i
 tell you plainly that we are after your money
 -or i am if you prefer to make me alone
 responsible pedro of course knows no more
 of it than any other animal would ricardo
 is of the faithful retainer class-absolutely
 identified with all my ideas wishes and even
 whims

 mr jones pulled his left hand out of his
 pocket got a handkerchief out of another and
 began to wipe the perspiration from his fore-
 head neck and chin the excitement from
 which he suffered made his breathing visible

 in his long dressing-gown he had the air of a
 convalescent invalid who had imprudently
 overtaxed his strength heyst broad-shouf-
 dered robust watched the operation from the
 end of the camp bedstead very calm his
 hands on his knees

  and by the bye he asked  where is he
now that henchman of yours breaking into
my desk

  that would be crude still crudeness is
one of lifes conditions there was the
slightest flavor of banter in the tone of ri-
cardos governor  conceivable but unlikely
martin is a little crude but you are not mr
heyst to tell you the truth i dont know


munseys magazine

precisely where he is he has been a little
mysterious of late but he has my confidence
no dont get up mr heyst

  the viciousness of his spectral face was in-
describable heyst who had moved a little
was surprised by the phenomenon

   it was not my intention he said

   pray remain seated mr jones insisted in
a languid voice but with a very determined
glitter in his black eye-caverns

   if you were more observant said heyst
with dispassionate contempt  you would have
known before i had been five minutes in the
room that i had no weapon of any sort on
me

   possibly but pray keep your hands still
they are very well where they are this is
too big an affair for me to take any risks

  big too big heyst repeated with
genuine surprise  good heavens what-
ever you are looking for theres very little of
it here-very little of anything

   you would naturally say so but thats
not what we have heard retorted mr jones
quickly with a grin so ghastly that it was im-
possible to think it voluntary

  heysts face had grown very gloomy he
knitted his brows

  what have you heard he asked

   a lot mr heyst-a lot affirmed mr
jones he was trying to recover his manner
of languid superiority  we have heard for
instance of a certain morrison once your
partner

  heyst could not repress a slight movement

  aha said mr jones with a sort of
ghostly glee on his face

  the muffled thunder resembled the echo of
a distant cannonade below the horizon and
the two men seemed to be listening to it in
sullen silence	

  this diabolical calumny will end in actu-
ally and literally taking my life from me
thought heyst

  then suddenly he laughed portentously
spectral mr jones listened to the sound

   thats as you please he said  i who
have been hounded out from society by a lot
of highly moral souls cant see anything fun-
ny in that story but here we are and you
will now have to pay for your fun mr
heyst

   you have heard a lot of ugly lies ob-
served heyst  take my word for it

   you would say so of course-very natural
as a matter of fact i havent heard very
much strictly speaking it was martin he
collects information and so on you dont

suppose i would talk to that schomberg ani-
mal more than i could help it was martin
whom he took into his confidence

   the stupidity of that creature is so great
that it becomes formidable heyst said as if
speaking to himself

  involuntarily his mind turned to the girl
wandering in the forest alone and terrified
would he ever see her again at that thought
he nearly lost his self-possession he looked
speculatively at mr jones who of course
had never for a moment taken his eyes from
his intended victim and the conviction came
to heyst that this outlaw from the higher
spheres was an absolutely hard and pitiless
scoundrel

  mr joness voice made him start

   it would be useless for instance to tell
me that your chinaman has run off with your
money a man living alone with a chinaman
on an island takes care to conceal property
of that kind so well that the devil himself-
 certainly heyst muttered

  again with his left hand mr jones mopped
his frontal bone his stalklike neck his razor
jaws his fleshless chin again his voice
faltered and his aspect became still more
gruesomely malevolent as of a wicked and
pitiless corpse

   i see what you mean he cried  but you
mustnt put too much trust in your ingenuity
you dont strike me as a very ingenious per-
son mr heyst neither am i my talents
lie another way but martin-

   who is now engaged in rifling my desk
interjected heyst

   i dont think so what i was going to
say is that martin is much cleverer than a
chinaman do you believe in racial superiori-
ty mr heyst i do firmly martin is great
at ferreting out such secrets as yours for in-
stance

  secrets like mine repeated heyst bit-
terly  well i wish him joy of all he can
ferret out

   thats very kind of you remarked mr
jones he was beginning to be anxious for
martins return of iron nerve at the gaming-
table fearless in a sudden affray he found
that this rather special kind of work was tell-
ing on his nerves keep still as you are
he cried sharply

   ive told you i am not armed said heyst
folding his arms on his breast

   i am really inclined to believe that you
are not admitted mr jones seriously
strange he mused aloud the caverns of
his eyes turned upon heyst then briskly
victory



  but my object is to keep you in this room
 dont provoke me by some unguarded move-
 ment to smash your knee or do something
 definite of that sort he passed his tongue
 over his lips which were dry and black while
 his forehead glistened with moisture i
 dont know if it wouldnt be better to do it
 at once

   he who deliberates is lost said heyst
 with grave mockery

   mr jones disregarded the remark he had
 the air of communing with himself

    physically i am no match for you he
 said slowly his black gaze fixed upon the man
 sitting on the end of the bed  you could
 spring-

   are you trying to frighten yourself
 asked heyst abruptly  you dont seem to
 have quite enough pluck for your business
 why dont you do it for once

   mr jones taking violent offense snorted
 like a savage skeleton

    strange as it may seem to you it is be-
 cause of my origin my breeding my tradi-
 tions my early associations and such like
 trifles not everybody can divest himself of
 the prejudices of a gentleman as easily as
 you have done mr heyst but dont worry
 about my pluck if you were to make a clean
 spring at me you would receive in mid air
 so to speak something that would make you
 perfectly harmless by the time you landed
 no dont misapprehend us mr heyst we
 are-er- adequate bandits and we are after
 the fruit of your labors as a-er-successful
 swindler its the way of the world-gorge
 and disgorge

   he wearily inclined his head on his left
 shoulder his vitality seemed exhausted
 even his sunken eyelids dropped a little with-
 in the bony sockets only his thin waspish
 beautifully penciled eyebrows drawn together
 a little suggested the will and the power to
 sting-something vicious unconquerable and
 deadly

 fruits swindler repeated heyst with-
 out heat almost without contempt  you are
 giving yourself no end of trouble you and
 your faithful henchman to crack an empty
 nut there are no fruits here as you imagine
 there are a few sovereigns which you may
 have if you like and since you have called
 yourself a bandit-

  yaas drawled mr jones that rather
 than a swindler open warfare at least

  very good only let me tell you that
 there were never in the world two more de-
 luded bandits-never

    heyst uttered these words with such energy
   that mr jones stiffening up seemed to be-
   come thinner and taller as he leaned in his
   metallic-blue dressing-gown against the white-
   washed wall

    fooled by a silly rascally innkeeper
  heyst went on  talked over like a pair of
  children with a promise of sweets

     i didn t talk with that disgusting animal
 muttered mr jones sullenly but he con-
 vinced martin who is no fool

     i should think he wanted very much to be
 convinced said heyst with the courteous in-
 tonation so well known in the islands i
 dont want to disturb your touching trust in
 your-your follower but he must be the most
 credulous brigand in existence what do you
 imagine if the story of my riches were ever
 so true do you think schomberg would have
 imparted it to you from sheer altruism is
 that the way of the world mr jones

    for a moment the lower jaw of ricardos
 gentleman dropped but it came up with a
 snap of scorn and he said with spectral in-
 tensity

    the beast is cowardly he was fright-
 ened and wanted to get rid of us if you want
 to know mr heyst i dont know that the
 material inducement was so very great but i
 was bored and we decided to accept the bribe

 i dont regret it all my life i have been
 seeking new impressions and you have turned
 out to be something quite out of the common
 martin of course looks to the material results
 hes simple-and faithful-and wonderfully
 acute

  ah yes hes on the track -and now
 heysts speech had the character of politely
 grim raillery- but not sufficiently on the
 track as yet to make it quite convenient to
 shoot me without more ado didnt schom-
 berg tell you precisely where i conceal the
 fruit of my rapines pah dont you know
 he would have told you anything true or false
 from a very clear motive revenge mad
 hate-the unclean idiot

  mr jones did not seem very much moved
 on his right hand the doorway incessantly
 flickered with distant lightning and the con-
 tinuous rumble of thunder went on irritatingly
 like the growl of an inarticulate giant mutter-
 ing menaces

  heyst overcame his immense repugnance to
 allude to her whose image cowering in the
 forest was constantly before his eyes with all
 the pathos and force of its appeal august
 pitiful and almost holy to him it was in a
 hurried embarrassed manner that he went on


munseys magazine

  if it had not been for that girl whom he
persecuted with his insane and odious pas-
sion and who threw herself on my protection
he would never have-but you know well
enough

  i dont know burst out mr jones with
amazing heat  that hotel-keeper tried to
talk to me once of some girl he had lost but
i told him i didnt want to hear any of his
beastly women stories it had something to
do with you had it

  hst looked on serenely at this outburst
then lost his patience a little

  what sort of comedy is this you dont
mean to say that you didnt know that i had
-that the girl was here

  one could see that the eyes of mr jones
had become fixed in the depths of their black
holes by the gleam of white becoming steady
there the whole man seemed frozen still

   here here he foamed out twice
there was no mistaking his astonishment his
shocked incredulity - something like fright-
ened disgust

  heyst was disgusted also but in another
way he too was incredulous he regretted
having mentioned the girl but the thing was
done his repugnance had been overcome in the
heat of his argument against the absurd
bandit

   is it possible that you didnt know of that
significant fact he inquired  or the only
effective truth in the welter of silly lies that
deceived you so easily

  no i didnt mr jones shouted  but
martin did h added in a faint whisper
which heysts ears just caught and no more

   i kept her out of sight as long as i could
said heyst  perhaps with your bringing up
traditions and so on you will understand my
reason for it

  he knew he knew before mr jones
went on in a hollow voice  he knew of her
from the first

  backed hard against the wall he no longer
watched heyst he had the air of a man who
had seen an abyss yawning under his feet

   if i want to try and kill him this is my
time thought heyst but he did not move

  next moment mr jones jerked his head up
glaring with sardonic fury

   i have a good mind to shoot you you
woman-ridden hermit you man in the moon
that cant exist without-no it wont be you
that  shoot its the other woman-lover-
the prevaricating sly low-class amorous cuss
and he shaved-shaved under mv very nose
 shoot him

  hes gone mad thought heyst startled
by the specters sudden fury

  he felt himself more in danger nearer
death than ever since he had entered that
room an insane bandit is a deadly combina-
tion he did not could not know that mr
jones was quick-minded enough to see al-
ready the end of his reign over his excellent
secretarys thoughts and feelings the coming
failure of ricardos fidelity

 a woman had intervened a woman a
girl who apparently possessed the power to
awaken mens disgusting folly her power
had been proved in two instances already-
the beastly innkeeper and that man with the
mustache upon whom mr jones his deadly
right hand twitching in his pocket glared
more in revulsion than in anger

  the very object of the expedition was lost
from view in his sudden and overwhelming
sense of utter insecurity and that made mr
jones feel very savage but not against the
man with the mustache he was nothing

  thus while heyst was really feeling that
his life was not worth two minutes purchase
he heard himself addressed with no affectation
of languid impertinence but with a burst of
feverish determination

  here lets call a truce said mr jones

  heysts heart was too sick to allow him to
smile

   have i been making war on you he
asked wearily  how do you expect me to
attach any meaning to your words he went
on  you seem to be a morbid woman-
hating sort of bandit we dont speak the
same language if i were to tell you why i
am here talking to you you wouldnt believe
me because you would not understand me it
certainly isnt the love of life from which i
have divorced myself long ago-not sufficient-
ly perhaps but if you are thinking of yours
then i repeat to you that it has never been in
danger from me i am unarmed

  mr jones was biting his lower lip in a
deep meditation it was only toward the last
that he looked at heyst

   unarmed eh then he burst out violent-
ly i tell you a gentleman is no match for
the common people and yet one must make
use of them unarmed eh and i suppose
that creature is of the commonest sort you
could hardly have got her out of a drawing-
room though theyre all alike for that
matter unarmed its a pity i am in much
greater danger than you are or were-or i
am much mistaken but i am not-i know
my man
victory



  he lost his air of mental vacancy and broke
into shrill exclamations to heyst they
seemed madder than anything that had gone
before

  on the track on the scent he cried
forgetting himself to the point of executing a
dance of rage in the middle of the floor

  heyst looked on mute fascinated by this
skeleton in a gay dressing-gown agitated like
a grotesque toy on the end of an invisible
string it became quiet suddenly

   i might have smelled a rat i always
knew that would be the danger he changed
suddenly to a confidential tone fixing his
sepulchral stare on heyst  and yet here i
am taken in by the fellow like the veriest
fool ive been always on the watch for some
such beastly influence but here i am fairly
caught he shaved himself right in front of
me-and i never guessed

  the shrill laugh following on the low tone
of secrecy sounded so convincingly insane that
heyst got up as if moved by a spring mr
jones stepped back two paces but displayed
no uneasiness

  its as clear as daylight he said mourn-
fully and fell silent

  behind him the doorway flickered lividly
and the sound as of a naval action somewhere
away on the horizon filled the breathless pause
mr jones inclined his head languidly over his
shoulder his mood had completely changed

  what do yotpay unarmed man shall
we go and see what is detaining my trusted
martin so long he asked me to keep you
engaged in friendly conversation till he made
a further examination of that track ha
ha ha

   he is no doubt ransacking my house said
heyst

  he was bewildered it seemed to him that
all this was an incomprehensible dream or
perhaps an elaborate other-world joke con-
trived by the specter in a gorgeous dressing-
gown

  mr jones looked at him with a horrible
cadaverous smile of inscrutable mockery and
pointed to the door heyst passed through it
first his feelings had become so blunted that
he did not care how soon he was shot in the
back

  how oppressive the air is the voice of
mr jones said at his elbow  this stupid
storm gets on my nerves i would welcome
some rain though it would be unpleasant to
get wet on the other hand this exasperating
thunder has the advantage of covering the
sound of our approach the lightnings not

so convenient ah your house fully illumi-
nated my clever martin is punishing your
stock of candles he belongs to the uncere-
monious classes which are also unlovely un-
trustworthy and so on

   i left the candles burning said heyst
 to save him trouble

  you really believed he would go to your
house asked mr jones with genuine in-
terest

   i had that notion strongly i do believe
he is there now

   and you dont mind

   no

   you dont mr jones stopped to won-
der  you are an extraordinary man he
said suspiciously and moved on touching el-
bows with heyst

  in the latters breast dwelt a deep silence
the complete silence of unused faculties at
this moment by simply shouldering mr jones
he could have thrown him down and put him-
self by a couple of leaps beyond the certain
aim of the revolver but he did not even think
of that his very will seemed dead of weari-
ness he moved automatically his head hang-
ing low like a prisoner captured by the evil
power of a masquerading skeleton released
from the grave

  mr jones took charge of the direction
they fetched a wide sweep the echoes of
distant thunder seemed to dog their footsteps

   by the bye said mr jones as if unable
to restrain his curiosity  arent you anxious
about that-ouch-that fascinating creature
to whom you owe whatever pleasure you can
find in our visit

   i have placed her in safety said heyst
 i-i took good care of that

  he did not raise his head when mr jones
laid a hand on his arm

 you have look is that what you
mean

  heyst raised his head in the flicker of
lightning the desolation of the cleared ground
on his left leaped out and sank into the night
together with the elusive forms of things dis-
tant pale unearthly but in the brilliant
square of the door he saw the girl-the wom-
an he had longed to see once more-as if en-
throned with her hands on the arms of the
chair she was in black her face was white
her head dreamily inclined on her breast

  he saw her only as low as her knees he
saw her-there in the room alive with a
somber reality it was no mocking vision
she was not in the forest-but there she
sat there in the chair seemingly without

strength yet without fear and tenderly in-
clined

  can you understand their power whis-
pered the hot breath of mr jones into his
ear  can there be a more disgusting spec-
tacle its enough to make the earth detest-
able she seems to have found her affinity
move on closer if i have to shoot you in
the end then perhaps you will die cured
heyst obeyed the pushing pressure of a re-
volver barrel between his shoulders he felt
it distinctly but he did not feel the ground
under his feet

  they found the steps without his being
aware that he was ascending them - slowly
one by one doubt entered into him-a doubt
of a new kind formless hideous it seemed
to spread itself all over him enter his limbs
and lodge in his entrails he stopped sudden-
ly with a thought that he who experienced
such a feeling had no business to live-or per-
haps was no longer living

  everything-the bungalow the forest the
open ground-trembled incessantly the earth
the sky itself shivered all the time and the
only thing immovable in the shuddering uni-
verse was the interior of the lighted room and
the woman in black sitting in the light of the
four candle-flames they flung around her an
intolerable brilliance which hurt his eyes
seemed to sear his very brain with the radia-
tion of infernal heat

  it was some time before he made out ri-
cardo seated on the floor at a little distance
his back to tlje doorway but only partly so
one side of his upturned face showing the ab-
sorbed forgetful rapture of his contemplation

  the grip of mr joness hard claw drew
heyst back a little in the roll of thunder
swelling and subsiding he whispered in his ear
a sarcastic of course

  a great shame descended upon heyst-the
shame of guilt absurd and maddening mr
jones drew him still further back into the
darkness of the veranda

   this is serious he went on distilling his
ghostly venom into heysts very ear  i had
to shut my eyes many times to his little flings
but this is serious he has found his soul-
mate mud souls obscene and cunning mud
bodies too-the mud of the gutter i tell
you we are no match for the vile herd i
even i have nearly been caught he asked
me to detain you till he gave me the signal
it wont be you that ill have to shoot but
him i wouldnt trust him near me for five
minutes after this

  he shook heysts arm a little

  if you had not happened to mention the
creature we should both have been dead be-
fore morning he would have stabbed you as
you came down the steps after leaving me and
then he would have walked up to me and
planted the same knife between my ribs he
has no prejudices the viler the origin the
greater the freedom of these simple souls

  he stretched his neck to peer into the room
from the side heyst too made a step for-
ward under the slight impulse of that slender
hand clasping his arm with a thin bony grasp

   behold the skeleton of the crazy bandit
jabbered thinly into his ear in spectral fellow-
ship  behold the simple acis kissing the
sandals of the nymph on the way to her
lips all forgetful while the menacing fife of
polyphemus already resounds close by-if he
could only hear it stoop a little

xxxviii

  on returning to the heyst bungalow rapid
as if on wings ricardo saw the girl waiting
for him she was dressed in black and at
once his uplifting exultation was replaced by
an awed and quivering patience before her
white face before the immobility of her re-
poseful pose the more amazing to him who
had encountered the strength of her limbs and
the indomitable spirit in her body

  she had come out at once after reysts de-
parture and had sat down under the portrait
to wait for the return of the man of violence
and death while lifting the curtain she felt
the anguish of her disobedience to her lover
which was soothed by a feeling she had known
before-a gentle flood of penetrating sweet-
ness

  she was not automatically obeying a mo-
mentary suggestion she was under influences
more deliberate more vague and of greater
potency she had been prompted not by her
will but by a force that wras outside of her
and more worthy she reckoned upon nothing
definite she had calculated nothing she saw
only her purpose of capturing death-savage
sudden irresponsible death prowling round
the man who possessed her death embodied
in the knife ready to strike into his heart

  all she thought of - the essence of her
tremors her flushes of heat and her shudders
of cold-was the question how to get hold of
that knife the mark and sign of stalking
death a tremor of impatience to clutch the
frightful thing glimpsed once and unforget-
able agitated her hands

  and yet it was the instinctive flinging for-
ward of these very hands that stopped ricar-

do dead short between the door and her chair
with the ready obedience of a conquered man
who can bide his time

   her success disconcerted her she listened
 to the mans impassioned transports of terrible
 eulogy and even more terrible declarations of
 love she was even able to meet his eyes
 oblique apt to glide away but now throwing
 feral gleams of desire

    no he was saying after an impassioned
 outpouring of words in which the most fero-
 cious phrases of his love were mingled with
 wooing accents of entreaty  i will have no
 more of it dont you mistrust me i am
 sober in my talk feel how quietly my heart
 beats ten times to-day when you you you
 swam in my eye i thought it would burst one
 of my ribs or leap out of my throat it has
 knocked itself dead tired waiting for this eve-
 ning for this very minute and now it can
 do no more feel how quiet it is

   he made a step forward but she raised her
 clear voice commandingly

  no nearer

   he stopped with a smile of imbecile worship
 on his lips and with the delighted obedience
 of a man who could at any moment seize her
 in his hands and dash her to the ground

  ah if i had taken you by the throat
that morning and had had my way with you
i should never have known what you are
you are a wonder and so am i in my way
i have nerve and i have brains too we
should have been lost many times but for me
i plan-i plot for my gentleman gentleman
-pah i am sick of him and you are sick
of yours eh you you

   he shook all over he cooed at her a string
 of endearing names obscene and tender and
 then asked abruptly

  why dont you speak to me

    its my part to listen she said giving
 him an inscrutable smile with a flush on her
 cheek and her lips cold as ice

   but you will answer me

    yes she said her eyes dilated as if with
 sudden interest

   wheres that plunder do you know
  no not yet

   but there is plunder stowed somewhere
thats worth having

   yes i think so but who knows she
added after a pause

  and who cares he retorted recklessly

 ive had enough of this crawling on my
belly its you who are my treasure its i
who found yon out where a gentleman had
buried you to rot for his accursed pleasure

   he looked behind him and all around for a
seat then turned to her his troubled eyes and
dim smile

    i am dog-tired he said and sat down on
 the floor  i went tired since this morning
 since i came in here and started talking to
 you as tired as if i had been pouring my
 life-blood here on these planks for you to
 dabble your white feet in

   unmoved she nodded at him thoughtfully
womanlike all her faculties remained concen-
trated on her hearts desire-on the knife-
while the man went on babbling insanely at
her feet ingratiating and savage almost crazy
with elation but he too was holding on to
his purpose

  for you for you i will throw away
money lives-all the lives but mine what
you want is a man a master that will let you
put the heel of your shoe on his neck not
that skulker who will get tired of you in a
year-and you of him and then what you
are not one to sit still neither am i i live
for myself and you shall live for yourself too
not for a swedish baron they make a con-
venience of people like -you and me a gentle-
man is better than an employer but an equal
partnership against all the yporcrites is the
thing for you and me well go on wandering
the world over you and i both free and both
true you are no cage bird to be shut up in
a prison like this well rove together for we
are of them that have no homes we are
born rovers

   she listened to him with the utmost atten-
 tion as if any unexpected word might give
 her some sort of opening to get that dagger
 that awful knife - to disarm murder itself
 pleading for her love at her feet again she
 nodded at him thoughtfully rousing a gleam
 in his yellow eyes yearning devotedly upon
 her face

   when he hitched himself a little closer her
 soul had no movement of recoil this had
 to be anything had to be which would bring
 the knife within her reach

   he talked more confidentially now

    we have met and their time has come
he began looking up into her eyes the
partnership between me and my gentleman
has to be ripped up theres no room for him
where we are why he would shoot me like
a dog dont you worry this will settle it
not later than to-night

   he tapped his folded leg below the knee
and was surprised flattered by the lighting up
of her face which stooped toward him eagerly
and remained expectant the lips girlishly part-

  ed red in the pale face and quivering in the
  quickened drawing of her breath

      you marvel you miracle you mans luck
  and joy-one in a million no the only
  one you have found your man in me he
  whispered tremulously to serve-to rule
  listen they are having their last walk to-
  gether for ill do for your gentleman too
  by midnight

     without the slightest tremor she murmured
  as soon as the tightening of her breast had
  eased off and the words would come

     i wouldnt be in too much of a hurry-
  with him

     the pause the tone had all the value of
  meditated advice

      good thrifty girl he laughed low with
  a strange feline gaiety expressed by the un-
  dulating movement of his shoulder and the
  sparkling snap of his oblique eyes  you are
  still thinking about the chance of that swag
  youll make a good partner that you will
  and i say what a decoy you will make
  jee-miny 

     he was carried away for a moment but his
  face darkened swiftly

    no no reprieve what do you think
  a fellow is-a scarecrow all hat and clothes
  and no feeling no inside no brain to make
  fancies for himself no he went on violent-
  ly never in his life will he go again into
  that room-never any more

a silence fell he was gloomy with the tor-
ment of his jealousy and did not even look at
her she sat up and slowly gradually bent
lower and ldwer over him as if ready to fall
into his arms he looked up at last and
checked this droop unwittingly

   say you who are up to fighting a man
with your bare hands could you-eh-could
you manage to stick one with a thing like
mine

  she opened her eyes very wide and gave him
a wild smile

how can i tell she whispered enchant-
mgly  will you let me have a look at it
without taking his eyes from her face he
got the knife out of its sheath-a short broad
cruel double-edged blade with a bone handle
and only then looked down at it

  a good friend he said simply take
it in your hand and feel the balance he
suggested

  at the moment when she bent forward to
receive it from him there was a flash of fire
m her mysterious eyes-a red gleam in the

in trapped the promptings and
longings of her soul she had done it the

very sting of death was in her hands the
venom of the viper in her paradise extracted
safe in her possession-and its head all but
lying under her heel

 ricardo stretched on the mats of the floor
 crept closer and closer to the chair

 all her thoughts were busy now in planning
 how to keep possession of that weapon which
 had seemed to have drawn into itself every
 danger and menace on the death-ridden earth
 she said with a low laugh the exultation in
 which he failed to recognize

 i didnt think that you would ever trust
me with that thing

 why not

 for fear i should suddenly strike you
with it	

 what for for that mornings work oh
no theres no spite in you for that you
forgave me you saved me you got the
better of me too and anyhow what good
would it be

 no no good she admitted

in her heart she felt that she would not
know how to do it that if it came to a
struggle she would have to drop the dagger
and fight with her hands

 listen when we are going about the
world together you shall always call me your
husband do you hear

 v es she said bracing herself for the con-
 test in whatever shape it was coming

the knife was lying in her lap she let it
slip into the fold of her dress and laid her
forearms with clasped fingers over her knees
which she pressed desperately together the
dreaded thing was out of sight at last she
felt a dampness in her limbs

  i am not going to hide you like that good-
 for-nothing finicky sneery gentleman you
 shall be my pride and my chum isnt that
 better than rotting on an island for the pleas-
 ure of a gentleman till he gives you a chuck

  ill be anything you like she said

 in his intoxication he crept closer with every
 word she uttered with every movement she
 made

 give me your foot he begged in a timid
murmur with the full consciousness of his
power

anything anything to keep murder quiet
and disarmed till strength had returned to her
limbs and she could make up her mind what
to do her fortitude had been shaken by the
very facility of success that had come to her

she advanced her foot forward a little from
under the hem of her skirt ana he threw
himself on it greedily
victory



   she was not even ware of him she had
 thought of the forest to which she had been
 told to run yes the forest-that was the
 place for her to carry off the terrible spoil
 the sting of vanquished death

    ricardo clasping her ankle pressed his lips
 time after time to the instep muttering gasp-
 ing words that wrere like sobs making little
 noises that resembled the sounds of grief and
 distress unheard by them both the thunder
 growled distantly with angry modulations of
 its tremendous voice while the world outside
 shuddered incessantly around the dead still-
 ness of the room where the framed profile of
 heysts father looked severely into space

   suddenly ricardo felt himself spumed by
 the foot he had been cherishing-spurned with
 a push of such violence into the very hollow
 of his throat that it swung him back instantly
 into an upright position on his knees he read
 his danger in the stony eyes of the girl and
 in the very act of leaping to his feet he heard
 sharply detached on the comminatory voice
 of the storm the brief report of a shot which
 half stunned him in the manner of a blow

   he turned his burning head and saw heyst
 towering in the doorway the thought that
 the beggar had started to prance darted
 through his head for a fraction of a second
 his distracted eyes sought for his weapon all
 over the floor he couldnt see it

     stick him you he called hoarsely to the
 girl and dashed headlong for the door of the
 compound

   while he thus obeyed the instinct of self-
 preservation his reason was telling him that
 he could not possibly reach it alive it flew
 open however with a crash before his
 launched weight and instantly he swung it to
 behind him there his shoulder leaning
 against it his hands clinging to the handle
 dazed and alone in the night full of shudders
 and muttered menaces he tried to pull him-
 self together

   he asked himself if he had been shot at
 more than once his shoulder was wet with
 the blood trickling from his head feeling
 above his ear he ascertained that it was only
 a graze but the shock of the surprise had
 unmanned him for the moment

 what the deuce was the governor about to
 let the beggar break loose like this or-
 was the governor dead perhaps

 the silence within the room awed him of
 going back there could be no question

  but she knows how to take care of her-
 self he muttered

 she had his knife it was she now who was

 deadly while he was disarmed no good for the
 moment

   he stole away from the door staggering
 the warm trickle running down his neck to
 find out what had become of the governor and
 to provide himself with a firearm from the
 armory in the trunks

xxxix

    mr jones after firing his shot over heysts
 shoulder had thought it proper to dodge
 away like the specter he was he had noise-
 lessly vanished from the veranda

   heyst stumbled into the room and looked
 around all the objects in there-the books
 the gleam of old silver familiar to him from
 boyhood the very portrait on the wall-
 seemed shadowy unsubstantial the dumb ac-
 complices of an amazing dream-plot ending
 in an illusory effect of awakening and the im-
 possibility of ever closing his eyes again

    with dread he forced himself to look at the
 girl still in the chair she was leaning for-
 ward far over her knees and had hidden her
 face in her hands

    she sat up a little then leaned back and
 taking her hands from her face pressed both
 of them to her breast as if moved to the
 heart by seeing him there looking at her with
 a black horror-struck curiosity

    he would have pitied her if the triumphant
 expression of her face had not given him a
 shock which destroyed the balance of his feel-
 ings she spoke with an accent of wild joy
 i knew you would come back in time
 you are safe now i have done it i would
 never never have let him-

    her voice died out while her eyes shone at
 him as when the sun breaks through a mist
 never oh my axel

    he bowed his head gravely and said in his
 polite heystian tone

   no doubt you acted from instinct wom-
 en have been provided with their own weapon

 i was a disarmed man i have been a dis-
 armed man all my life as i see it now you
 may glory in your resourcefulness and your
 knowledge of yourself but i must say that
 the other attitude suggestive of shame had
 its charm for you are full of charm

 the exultation vanished from her face

 you mustnt make fun of me now what
shame i was thanking god with all my sin-
ful heart for having been able to do it-for
giving you to me in that way-oh my beloved
-all my own at last

he stared as if mad timidly she tried to
excuse herself for disobeying his directions for


munseys magazine

 her safety every modulation of her en-
 chanting voice cut deep into his very breast
 so that he could hardly understand the words
 for the sheer pain of it

    he turned his back on her but a sudden
 drop an extraordinary weakness which came
 upon her tone made him spin round on her
 white neck her pale head drooped as in a cruel
 draft a withered flower droops on its stalk

    he caught his breath looked at her closely
  and seemed to read some awful intelligence in
  her eyes at the moment when her eyelids
  fell as if smitten from above by an invisible
  power he snatched her up bodily out of the
  chair and disregarding an unexpected metallic
  clatter on the floor carried her off into the
  other room

    the limpness of her body frightened him
 laying her down on the bed he ran out again
 seized a four-branched candlestick on the
 table and ran back tearing down with a furi-
 ous jerk the curtain that swung stupidly in
 his way but after putting the candlestick on
 the table by the bed he remained absolutely
 idle there did not seem anything more for
 him to do

    holding his chin in his hand he looked down
  intently at her still face

    has she been stabbed with this thing
 asked davidson whom he suddenly saw stand-
 ing by his side and holding up ricardos dagger
 to his sight

    heyst uttered no word of recognition or sur-
  prise he gave davidson only a dumb look
  of unutterable awe then as if possessed with
  a sudden fury he started tearing open the
  front of the girls dress

    she remained insensible under his hands
 and heyst let out a groan which made david-
 son shudder inwardly-the heavy plaint of a
 man who falls clubbed in the dark

  they stood side by side looking mournfully
  at the little black hole made by mr joness
  bullet under the swelling breast of a dazzling
  and as it were a sacred whiteness it rose
  and fell slightly -so slightly that only the

  eyes of the lover could detect that faint stir
of life

 heyst calm and utterly unlike himself in
he face moving about noiselessly prepared
a wet cloth and laid it on the insignificant
wound round which there was hardlv a trace
ol blood to mar the charm the fascination of
that mortal flesh

 her eyelids fluttered she looked drowsily

tiotjtne as if fatigued ony by the exer-
iz j herctrfmetldus victory- capturing the
very stmg of death m the service of life but

  her eyes became very wide awake when they
  caught sight of ricardos dagger the spoil of
  vanquished death which davidson was still
  holding unconsciously

   give it to me she said  its mine
  davidson put the symbol of her victory into
  the feeble hands extended to him with the
  innocent gesture of a child reaching for a toy

      for you she gasped turning her eyes to
  heyst u kill nobody

    no said heyst taking the dagger and
  laying it on her breast while her hands fell
  powerless by her sides

     ihe faint smile on her deep-cut lips waned
  and for a moment the girls head sank deep
  jnto the pillow taking on the majestic pallor
  and immobility of marble but over the
  muscles which seemed set in their transfigured
  beauty forever passed a slight and awful
  tremor with an amazing strength she asked
  loudly

     whats the matter with me

    you have been shot dear lena heyst
  said in a steady voice while davidson at the
  question turned away and leaned his head
  against the post at the foot of the bed
  shot i thought something struck me
  over samburan the thunder had ceased to
  growl at last and the world of material forms
  shuddered no more under the emerging stars
  the spirit of the girl which was passing away
  from under them clung to her triumph con-
  vinced of the reality of her victory over death

     no more she muttered  there will be
  no more oh my beloved she cried weaklv

  ive saved you why dont you take me
 into your arms and carry me out of this lonely
 place

  heyst bent low over her cursing his fastidi-
  ous soul which even at that moment kept the
  true cry of love from his lips in its infernal
  mistrust of itself he dared not touch this
  faint flicker of life and she had no longer the
  strength to throw her arms about his neck

   who else could have done this for you
  she whispered gloriously

    no one in the world he answered her ih
  a murmur of unconcealed despair

  she tried to raise herself but all she could
do was to lift her head a little from the pil-
low with a terrified and gentle movement
heyst hastened to slip his arm under her
neck she felt relieved of an intolerable
weight and was content to surrender to him
the infinite weariness of her tremendous
achievement

  exulting she saw herself extended on the
bed m a black dress and profoundly at peace
victory



  while stooping over her with a kindly play-
  ful smile he was about to lift her up in his
  firm untrembling arms and take her into the
  sanctuary of his innermost heart-at last
  the flush of rapture flooding her whole being
  broke out in a smile of innocent girlish hap-
  piness and with that divine radiance on her
  lips she breathed her last triumphant seeking
  for his glance in the shades of death

               xl

    yes excellency said davidson in his
  placid voice there are more dead in this
  affair more white people i mean-than have
  been killed in most of the battles of the last
  achin war

    davidson was talking with an excellency
  because what was alluded to in conversation
  as  the mystery of samburan  had caused
  such a sensation in the archipelago that even
  those in the highest spheres were anxious to
  hear something at first hand davidson had
  been summoned to an audience it was a
  lieutenant-governor or some such personage
  on his tour

     you knew the late baron heyst well
  the truth is that nobody out here can
  boast of having known him well said david-
  son  he was a queer chap i doubt if he
  himself knew how queer he was but every-
  body was aware that i was keeping my eye on
  him in a friendly way and thats how i got
  the warning which made me turn round in my
  tracks in the middle of my trip and steam
  back to samburan where i am grieved to say

  i arrived too late

    without enlarging very much davidson ex-
  plained to the attentive excellency how a wom-
  an the wife of a certain hotel-keeper named
  schomberg had overheard two card-sharping
  rascals making inquiries from her husband as
  to the exact position of the island she
  caught only a few words referring to the
  neighboring volcano but these were enough to
  arouse her suspicions- which went on
  davidson she imparted to me your excel-
  lency they were only too well founded
  that was very clever of her remarked
  the great man

  shes much cleverer than people have any
conception of said davidson

 but he refrained from disclosing to the ex-
cellency the real cause which had sharpened
mrs schombergs wits the poor woman was
m mortal terror of the girl being brought
back within reach of her infatuated wilhelm
davidson only said that her agitation had im-
pressed him but he confessed that while go-

   ing back he began to have his doubts as to
   there being anything in it

      i got into one of those silly thunder-
   storms that hang about the volcano and had
   some trouble in making the island narrated
   davidson i had to grope mv way dead
   slow into black diamond bay i dont sup-
   pose that anybody even if looking out for me
   could have heard me let go the anchor

      he admitted that he ought to have gone
   ashore at once but everything was perfectly
   dark and absolutely quiet he felt ashamed
   of his impulsiveness what a fool he would
   have looked waking up a man in the middle
   of the night just to ask him if he was all
   right and then the girl being there he was
   afraid that heyst would look upon his visit
   as an unwarrantable intrusion

      the first intimation he had of there being
   something wrong was a big white boat adrift
   with the body of a very hairy man inside
   bumping against the bows of his steamer

    en he st no time in going ashore-alone
   of course from motives of delicacy

        i was there in time to see that poor girl
   die as i have told your excellency pursued
   davidson  i wont tell you what a time i
   had with him afterward he talked to re it
   did him good his father seems to have been
   a crank and to have upset his head when he
   was young he was a queer chap practically
   the last words he said to me as we came out
   on the veranda were

     ah davidson wo to the man whose
   neart has not learned while young to hope to
   love-and to put its trust in life

   as we stood there just before i left him
   or he said he wanted to be alone with his dead
   for a time we heard a snarly sort of voice
   ncr pushes by the shore calling out

        is that you governor
       yes its me

      jeeminy i thought the beggar had done
 or you lie has started prancing and nearly
 had me i bolted out and have been dodging
 looking for you ever since

      well here i am suddenly screamed the
 other voice and then a shot rang out

      this time he has not missed him hevst
 said to me bitterly and went back into the
 house

    i went on board as he had insisted i should
 do i didn t want to intrude on his grief
 later about five in the morning some of my
 calashes came running to me yelling that there
 was a fire ashore i landed at once of course

  he principal bungalow was blazing the heat
 drove us back the other two houses caught


munseys magazine

one after another like kindling-wood there
vyas no going beyond the shore end of the
jetty till two hours afterward

   davidson sighed placidly

   i suppose you are certain that baron
heyst is dead

   he is- ashes your excellency said
davidson wheezing a little he and the
girl together i suppose he couldnt stand his
thoughts before her dead body-and fire puri-
fies everything that chinaman of whom i
told your excellency helped me to investigate
next day when the embers got cool enough
we found enough to be sure hes not a bad
chinaman he told me that he followed
heyst and the girl through the forest from
pity and partly out of curiosity he watched
the house till he saw heyst go out after din-
ner and ricardo come back alone while he
was dodging there it occurred to him that
he had better cast the boat adrift for fear
those scoundrels should come round by water
and bombard the village from the sea he
judged that they were devils enough for any-
thing so he walked down the wharf quietly
and as he got into the boat to cast her off that
hairy man who it seems was dozing in her
jumped up growling and wang shot him dead
then he shoved the boat off as hard as he
could and went away

   there was a pause presently davidson
went on in his tranquil manner

  let heaven look after what has been
puritied the wind and rain will take care
of the ashes the carcass of that follower
secretary or whatever the unclean scoundrel
called himself i left where it lay to swell and
rot in the sun his principal had shot him
neatly through the heart it was a toss-up
which of them would do for the other then
apparently jones went down the wharf to look
lor the boat and for the hairy man i sup-
pose he tumbled into the water by accident

or perhaps not by accident the boat and
the man were gone and the scoundrel saw him-
self all alone his game clearly up and fairly
trapped who knows the waters very
clear there and i could see him lying on the
bottom between the piles like a heap of bones
in a blue silk bag with only the head and
the feet sticking out wang was verv pleased
when we discovered him that made every-
thing safe he said and he went at once ovei
the hill to fetch his alfuro woman back to
the hut

  davidson took his handkerchief to wipe the
perspiration off his forehead

   and then your excellency i went away
there was nothing to be done there

   clearly assented the excellency

  davidson thoughtful seemed to weigh the
matter in his mind and then murmured with
placid sadness

   nothing

tone

thats where
the victrola
is pre-eminent

 the victrola brings to you the pure and varied tones of every
 musical instrument and the beauty and individuality of every human
 voice-all absolutely true to life

 such fidelity of tone was unknown before the advent of the
 victrola-the first cabinet style talking-machine and this pure and
 life-like tone is exclusively a victrola feature

 whyexclusive with the victrola

 because of the patented victrola features which have been per-
 fected after years of study and experiment

      goose-neck sound-box tube-the flexible metal connection between the sound-
  box and tapering tone arm which enables the victor needle to follow the record
  grooves with unerring accuracy

     concealed sounding-boards and amplifying compart-
  ment of wood-provide the very limit of area of vibrating
  surface and sound amplifying compartment so absolutely
  essential to an exact and pure tone reproduction

     modifying doors-may be opened wide thereby giving
  the tone in its fullest volume or doors may be set at any
  degree graduating the volume of tone to exactly suit every
  requirement closed tight the volume is reduced to the
  minimum and when not in use the interior is fully protected

      victor system of changeable needles-a perfect re-
  production is possible only with a perfect point-
  therefore a new needle for each record is the only
  positive assurance of a perfect point you also have
  your choice of full tone half tone or further modifi-
  cation with the fibre needle

  it is the perfection of every part and its per-
  fect combination with all other parts that gives
  the victrola its superior tone-that makes the
  victrola the greatest of all musical instruments

  there are victrolas in great variety from  to 
  and any victor dealer will gladly demonstrate them and
  play any music you wish to hear

  victor talking machine co camden n j u s a

        berliner gramophone co montreil canadian distributors
   always use victrolas with victor records and
   victor needles-the combination there is no
   other way to get the unequaled victrola
   tone

the telephone unites the nation

 at this time our country looms
i  large on the world horizon as an
example of the popular faith in the
underlying principles of the republic 

  we are truly one people in all that
the forefathers in their most exalted
moments meant by that phrase

 in making us a homogeneous peo-
ple the railroad the telegraph and
the telephone have been important
factors they have facilitated commu-
nication and intervisiting bringing us
closer together giving us a better
understanding and promoting more
intimate relations

  the telephone has played its part
as the situation has required that it
should have been planned for its
present usefulness is as wonderful as

that the vision of the forefathers should
have beheld the nation as it is today

  at first the telephone was the voice
of the community as the population
increased and its interests grew more
varied the larger task of the telephone
was to connect the communities and
keep all the people in touch regard-
less of local conditions or distance

  the need that the service should be
universal was just as great as that
there should be a common language
this need defined the duty of the
bell system

  inspired by this need and repeat-
edly aided by new inventions and
improvements the bell system has
become the welder of the nation it
has made the continent a community

experts testing chalmers motors for silence and pmoer
drawn from lije by h l grout

             silence is merely absence of noise
some automobile motors are silent
simply because the noises are covered
up-muffled but the friction the
grind which causes noise is there just the
same wearing away at the life of the mechanism

  chalmers motors arc silent because they are rightly designed
and built because the causes of noise are removed at high
motor speeds you can balance a pencil on end on the radiator cap
of any chalmers six motor thats because all working parts
are accurately balanced

   in a long hard pull through sand or up a steep hill the chalmers motor
does not grind or protest against the load thats because all parts are
accurate to  of an inch eliminating friction

   after seasons of use your chalmers motor runs as sweetly and develops
as much power as when new thats because it is built of the best materials
and designed for long service

   and these qualities are in every chalmers motor

   we prove it before a motor is put into a car by long runs under
load with an expert alwavs looking for defects the chalmers motor test
department a part of which is pictured above is equipped with the latest
scientific devices for detecting faults only motors which are right in every
detail can survive the trials of the chalmers  block test

   because all parts of a chalmers car receive the same rigid tests-because
the whole car is proved before it leaves the factory-the chalmers owner
knows little about the insides of his car he is conscious only of a continuous
readiness for any service he may ask of his quality first chalmers

atwood grapefruit

    no other grapefruit equals it in flavor

   the superiority of atwood grapefruit is not an accident from the first
   planting the atwood grapefruit co has sacrificed everything for qual-
   ity an initial expense of hundreds of thousands of dollars was
   incurred while everything that scientific culture and experience could suggest
   was done to produce quality even then some trees at maturity bore
   simply good grapefruit but not good enough for the atwood brand these
   trees were cut down and replaced by superior varieties

   so through the various processes of selection cultivation and elimination has
   evolved the atwood flavor as hard to describe as it is difficult to produce

       people who have eaten atwood grapefruit say 

   it is absolutely the best grapefruit i ever as usual your grapefruit is way ahead

 tasted

fruit is fine and full flavored the best
ever

 they are the nicest fruit we have ever tried
 the best that we have been able to secure

 fully ripe and delicious
