captain brink of the space marines

by bob olsen we have learned from explorers
of the depths of the ocean for instance that there
is a form of life peculiarly adapted to the enor-
mous pressure of the deep waters in high alti-
tudes other forms of life are found who can
tell but that there are intelligent beings some-
where in the universe who are peculiarly adapted
to the conditions surrounding other planets in our
universe naturally such life would be vastly
different from anything we know but bob olsen
of much fame has some very definitely thought-
out conceptions on the subject which he gives us

denouement is the reader will be worked up to

the human system are strongly brought out

the doom of lun-dhag by william lem-
kin phd we are all more or less acquainted
with fanatics-generally harmless fanatics-whom

to guard well some person or persons with brilliant
scientific minds who begin to labor under gross
delusions-as witness our friend-or enemy-in
this story which is one of dr lemkins best

the man who lived twice by william
kober there is no doubt that many experiments
calculated to prove time as the fourth dimension
or in fact to prove there is such a dimension

friction

 by t oconor sloane phd

he subject of lost motion in mechanics one some-
times feels is in a sense neglected there are
innumerable examples of it in machinery and in
the animal system its varieties are so many that
it seems that the one term is not enough for it-
that it should have many divisions sometimes
one feels that it should almost be treated as a
sort of a popular term and hardly a scientific one it is fair to
say a mans efforts in the mechanical line are devoted to moving
things or to arresting movement in some places where we
more or less unjustly consider that people are inferior to our-
selves loads are carried on the back or on the head when this
is done friction hardly comes into play at all and some very
extraordinary examples of this carrying of loads are cited among
indians especially in the southern part of this continent in old
times we used to often see bricks carried up a ladder in a recep-
tacle called a hod which rested on the shoulder of the work-
men this was a very fine example of almost frictionless opera-
tion it is seldom seen now as mechanical elevators of one kind
or another either steam or electric do the work and friction
again appears upon the scene if a heavy stone too heavy to
lift was to be moved in primitive times it would be pushed or
pulled by hand along the ground and the greatest effort relatively
speaking would be required to move it the rough surface of
the stone scraping along the ground and perhaps digging into it
generated any quantity of friction an improvement on this
which is still in use is the so-called stoneboat this is a fiat
platform of heavy plank with smooth steel straps or runners
beneath it intended to take the weight and to slide along the
ground with greatly reduced friction the stoneboat which is
only two or three inches thick avoids the necessity of lifting the
stone it is really a form of sled and sleds today play an
extremely important part in transporting material in the arctic
and sub-arctic regions sliding along on snow and ice with
greatly reduced friction the skater represents a sled as he
slides along first on one skate and then on the other so we have
not gotten rid of plain sliding friction but in the vast majority
of cases use it only where there is very little friction to be
experienced owing to the nature of the substances in contact with
each other generally steel and ice

  the total amount of friction depends of course on the travel
of one surface on the other and to reduce this man invented
an appliance which is one of the most amazing products of his
ingenuity and which plays an enormous part in the operations
of the world this appliance is the wheel if the axle is two
inches in diameter and the wheel three feet sliding friction as
we may call it is one-eighteenth of what it would be if the axle
slid directly on the ground

  so far we have spoken of sliding friction but unfortunately
there is what is known as rolling friction and this is exerted
between the periphery of the wheel and the surface on which it
rests its roadway lubricants such as oil and grease diminish
friction and are used as everybody knows in the bearings of
machinery in the hubs of wheels the friction between this
solid and a liquid is extremely small and if it were practical to
inject a liquid under the bearing of a wheel or shaft so that it
could rest upon a film of oil if such were the lubricant the
friction would be extremely small very serious attempts have
been made to apply this system and while it is not practical
except in special cases it has been found that it reduced friction
to an extremely small amount it has been exhibited in some of
the great expositions or worlds fairs and produced very strik-
ing effects it has even been suggested to use it as a lubricant
for a sled sliding in a grooved way but of course it suggests
and inevitably produces a great waste of lubricant one of the
bearing surfaces would be drilled full of small holes through
which the lubricant was to be forced giving a layer of pure
liquid instead of a bearing of babbit metal or brass

  one of the early improvements in bicycles was ball-bearings
for heavy work roller bearings were used the rollers or balls
relatively small fit quite closely between the axle and the joint
everything is very smooth lubricant is added and the balls or
cylinders as the case may be substitute roller friction for fric-
tion of surface against surface recently the roller bearings have
been used very extensively for the bearings of wheels on rail-
road cars the next thing should be rubber tires one of the
interesting features of ball-bearings is that the manufacture of
steel balls has developed enormously it is hard to say what a
steel ball would have cost in old times but now the cost of one
is absolutely trivial and the accuracy is extreme in roller and
ball bearings the balls or rollers as the case may be are subject
to very slight flattening this interferes considerably with their
efficiency

  an interesting thing in friction is what is known as the angle
of repose this is the steepest angle at which any given granular
of material will lie the sand at the seashore gives an excellent
example if we make a little heap of perfectly dry sand and
then move the finger around its base as nearly in a circle as
may be constantly approaching the center we will presently
have a conical heap of sand and the angle which the side of
the cone makes with the base gives you the angle of repose
this varies for different sands and is sometimes quite an im-
portant element to be considered in an engineering project it
is dependent on friction between the grains of sand if we follow
out the subject of friction to its fullest extent we will get quite
curious and interesting results

author of the universe wreckers the comet doom etc

tuilding a ship that will successfully travel across the void and safely
u land on another body in our vast universe is not the only consideration that
should be given the problems of interplanetary travel-when this new dream of
scientists is finally realized it might be well to give some thought to our
method of approach and our plan of action if and when we succeed in reach-
ing another planet-if there should perchance be life and intelligence where
we land our well-known author gives us in this new amazing story some very
vital things to think about

chapter i

  letter of dr ferdinand melford chemistry professor
  in the philadelphia school of science to arthur melford
  isstructor in physics manhattan university new york

my dear nephew arthur

i am writing to you to-night under con-
siderable stress of mind and i fear indeed
that this letter will cause you to consider
my mentality a little disordered but i beg
of you at the start to cast aside that thought and to read
seriously what i have to tell you a little incoherence is
perhaps to be forgiven a man who writes under such a
menacing shadow of death as now hangs over me 

  i can see you asking yourself in surprise death from
what i wish i knew the answer to that question my-
self but i do not all i know is that across my path
has come a sinister force or forces which i fear may
even this very night bring about my-   but there i
will leave all this and tell you the facts

  you will remember no doubt that in the last ten
months i have been engaged in all the time i could
spare from my routine work in the schools laboratories
and lecture-halls in a private research of my own a
study of rocket-fuels and a search for a fuel more effi-
cient than any now available as you know i was in-
terested in this field by henri mertaud the late french
rocket-experimenter whom i met more than a year ago
in paris when attending the international chemical con-
vention

  m mertaud was kind enough to show me and dr
cyrus hunger ford through whom i met him some of
his model and larger experimental rockets he rather
surprised me by the completeness of his laboratory which
included what he said was the best vacuum-tank for
rocket-tests in the world he gave me an interesting
account of the work he had carried on in this field for
six years first in collaboration with dr richard braun
of berlin and after dr brauns death alone mertaud
and dr braun as you know sent atmospheric rockets
much higher in the stratosphere than any had ever done
before having greatly improved the designs of such
pioneers as van hijnn and morrow

  m mertaud was convinced he told me that rockets
of his design or improvements of his design might with
sufficiently powerful fuel attain a high enough velocity
to escape entirely from the earths attraction and travel
through space to the moon or even at the right time
to the planets of mars or venus he even visualized the
possibility of such rockets someday carrying human
passengers and being capable of returning to earth all
this development would logically follow mertaud be-
lieved upon the improvement of rocket-designs and the
invention of lighter and more powerful fuels

  i was so interested by m mertauds statements that
i told him i would not mind spending some time in the
study of rocket-fuels myself mertaud at once took up
the suggestion as he had understood from dr hunger-
ford that i was a chemist of standing and the next day
sent me a mass of literature on rocket-designs and fuels
in the days that followed i had several talks with him




amazing stories

on the problem and when i left france i assured m
mertaud that as soon as i finished some special work on
hand i would devote myself to the rocket-fuel question

  i did so a few months after my return and eventu-
ally came to use most of my spare time on the problem i
soon found that the crux of the matter was to combine
in a single fuel the necessary elements of lightness power
and quickness of firing i will not give you the details
of my work but it is sufficient to say that i soon became
convinced as mertaud and braun had become that pow-
ders were an unsatisfactory form for rocket-fuels and
that liquefied gases offered a better approach than did
ordinary liquid fuels i was experimenting with combina-
tions of liquid hydrogen with various other liquefied
gases when the news of m mertauds unfortunate death
reached me four months ago

  you may remember that mertauds laboratory burned
down and that his charred body was found in it he
having been apparently trapped by the fire it was
supposed that some of the super-inflammable fuels he
was testing in model rockets had taken fire for it was
recalled that his former collaborator in rocket-experi-
ments dr richard braun had perished in a laboratory-
fire of similar nature

  of course i was shocked by mertauds death but it
did not make me think of giving up my researches as
i had now become quite interested in the fuel problem
i had no thought whatever that his death was anything
but the accident it appeared but i will say at this point
that i am now quite certain that the deaths of henri
meraud and of dr richard braun were not accidental
you will understand shortly how i know this

  at the time though my only reaction was a sincere
regret for m mertauds unfortunate end and i went
steadily on with my rocket-fuel experiments i cannot
give all the details of my work except to say that in
time i came to the conclusion that as a fuel-base liquid
hydrogen had drawbacks that outweighed its advantages
and i began to make tests of various combinations of
liquid oxygen alcohol and other substances

  not long after this-about two months ago-i entered
into some correspondence with an american physicist
who had taken up the problem of space-rocket design
this scientist a dr harris winn of detroit scientific
college was interested in the possibility of designing
small space-rockets capable of reaching the moon and
wrote me asking about some features of mertauds work
i answered mentioning my study of rocket-fuels and
we continued to exchange letters on the subject

  two weeks ago i published in the may number of
the journal of the association for the promotion of sci-
ence a short article summarizing the present status of
space-rocket work and mentioning besides the earlier
work of braun and mertaud and others my own work
with rocket-fuels and dr winns experiments this was
the first public announcement of my work and you will
soon see what consequences it brought in its wake i
fear indeed that its final consequence may be my death
but i am again in my nervousness outrunning my
story and must put things in their proper order

  tonight at about ten oclock five hours ago from
the time i write this i had a caller as you know i
still live and have my private laboratory in the old mel-
ford mansion and estate near the school with only bar-
nett my house-man staying in the place here at night
with me i was in my study when i heard the bell ring
and in a moment barnett brought in to me a card bearing

the entirely unfamiliar name of mr peter nebo
i told barnett to show him in mr peter nebo proved
a rather unusual-looking caller a squat stocky man
dressed in good-quality clothes that fitted him rather
badly his black hair was close-cut and his face and
hands were remarkably white and bloodless-looking as
though the man were just out of long confinement he
had unprepossessing pale-green eyes

  as this peter nebo entered the room i rose to meet
him but mannie my little rat-terrier who had been
drowsing by my desk sprang up before me and ran at
my caller barking furiously and showing his teeth in a
diminutive snarl i had barnett take out the little dog
then showed mr nebo a chair and when he was seated
asked what i could do for him

  his pale-green eyes looked at me for a moment with
a peculiar weighing expression before he spoke

  his voice was deep bass unusually resonant and he
spoke in quite unaccented english

  dr melford he said ive come on rather a strange
errand which has to do with your article on space-
rocket work published recently in the magazine of the
asssociation for the promotion of science

  youre not a reporter getting a story on the topic
are you  i asked certainly he did not look like one

  nebo shook his head no but i and some associates
of mine are very much interested in that article espe-
cially in the part of it where you stated that your work
with fuels might materially aid in the launching some
day of space-rockets toward other planets was that
correct 

  it was yes i told him of course all this work of
mine is purely experimental but if more efficient fuels
were devised they would certainly advance tremendously
the possibilities for successful space-rockets

  and it is for fuels of such efficiency that you are
searching pressed peter nebo i mean you are
working with the fuel-requirements of space-rockets
directly in mind 

  i am i replied for such a fuel would have to be
highly specialized but just what is your interest in
this mr nebo you say you are not a reporter
you will understand my interest nebo answered
when i tell you that instead of your association for the
promotion of science i represent a lesser-known organ-
ization that might be called an association for the re-
tardation of science

  association for the retardation of science i re-
peated puzzled is this a joke or am i to understand
that

  well let us say for the retardation of a certain field
of science peter nebo amended that field dr mel-
ford deals with the research of space-rocket improve-
ment which might someday lead to extra-terrestrial
travel and journeys to other planets our association
is unalterably opposed to such journeys ever being made
by men

  but why i asked are your objections theo-
logical 

  i am not at liberty to state fully the reasons for our
stand nebo said smoothly but i will say that we
are convinced that man will lose rather than gain by
making contacts with other worlds in space if that is
ever possible we are in a word earth-isolationists
that is certainly an unusual viewpoint i said but
i fail to see just what connection this has with my work
the connection is apparent said peter nebo you
space-rocket murders



are by your own admission experimenting with fuels
that might advance space-rocket design and thus greatly
increase the possibility of travel to other worlds our
society is determined to forestall such travel from ever
taking place we are therefore asking you to abandon
your researches in this direction and to destroy all the
notes and results your work has already yielded you
for a moment i was too much astounded by the cool
effrontery of this request to make answer to it then
i rose to my feet indignation possessing me

  really sir i wonder that you can make such a propo-
sition i said to ask a scientist to give up his re-
searches because you have some vague objections to
them

  you refuse to do so nebo asked calmly somehow
his calmness irritated me the more

of course i refuse i exclaimed what made you
think i would drop ten months work at your request
the pale-green eyes of the man opposite me hardened
as he rose it is not exactly a request he told me
it is more in the nature of a demand

  a demand i cried and he nodded

  yes and a demand you would do well to heed dr
melford our association is not wholly without power
and we are prepared to use force if that is necessary
to bring about our wishes

  you threaten me then i exclaimed and peter nebo
again calmly nodded

  i do unless you quit the rocket-fuel researches
immediately of your own will we will use force to stop
them will you agree to abandon this work

  mr nebo i said furiously i will give you one
minute to leave this house if you do not i will call
the police i am only prevented from doing so now by
my conviction that you are mentally unbalanced

  peter nebo looked at me for a moment in silence i
am sorry that this is your answer dr melford he
said and then walked out

  i was so angered for a few moments after he had
left that i was still rather of a mind to summon officers
to apprehend the man but after i had thought it over
for a few minutes it seemed to me so evident that the
fellow was at least partly insane that my anger faded
into irritation

i was beginning work again on the notes that had
engaged my attention before nebos interruption
when from out my subconscious memory came a vague
something that startled me it was a remembrance of
something henri mertaud had said in the last letter he
had written me before his death as memory of what
he had written grew clearer in my mind i rose to my
feet my thoughts utterly overturned then hastening
to my file i began a rapid search in it for mertauds
last letter

  when i found the letter which mertaud had written
to me the day before he perished in his laboratory fire
i ran quickly through it until i found the lines i wanted
i read them through and then the hazy suspicions in my
mind now crystallizing swiftly into a dreadful certainty
i went back and read them again

  this afternoon mertaud had written toward the
end of his letter another crank called on me one more
original than most of those who bother me most of
them you know are lack-witted people who hear of my
space-rocket work and want to set sail with me imme-
diately on a voyage to neptune or sirius

  this individual an odd-looking squat white-faced
and green-eyed fellow coolly told me that he represented
an organization opposed to all space-rocket or other sci-
entific work with interplanetary possibilities and in-
formed me that unless i ceased such work forthwith it
would be the worse for me very soon i showed him
the door without ceremony as i was rather busy i re-
member poor braun wrote me not long before his death
that someone with much the same idea had bothered him
truly the curse of this work is the number of crazed
and insincere persons it attracts to one

  i stared for moments at those lines my mind working
that odd-looking white-faced and green-eyed squat per-
son who had warned henri mertaud could only be the
man i had just ejected peter nebo nebo had de-
manded of mertaud that he stop space-rocket research
mertaud had refused as anyone would-and within
twenty-four hours mertaud had perished i that labora-
tory-fire that destroyed mertaud and his work was it
accidental or was it the work of nebo and his asso-
ciates 

  and what had mertaur said  that dr braun shortly
before his death had mentioned someone who had told
him to halt his rocket-researches and braun with his
work was destroyed soon after that just as mertaud was
later was it nebo and his associates then who had
warned and destroyed in brauns case also then ne-
bos tale of his organization determined to stop space-
rocket research at all costs was the truth and no mere
figment of his mind

  it seemed and still seems to me that any group of
men must be partly mad who would let their convictions
on such an academic subject carry them to such lengths
but whatever the truth as to that it was indisputable that
these men were deliberately using murder when other
means failed to stop all scientific research that might lead
to interplanetary travel

  if this was so i was in real and imminet danger
nebo and his associates had warned me and i had flout-
ed their warning if the cases of braun and mertaud
were any criterion they would not allow me long to live
most of my notes and formulas on the rocket-fuel experi-
ments were in my private laboratory here in the house
as no doubt they knew at any time they might try to
destroy me and my work together as they had destroyed
braun and mertaud

  immediately i reached for the telephone and in a min-
ute i had laid the situation before the police department
though somewhat skeptical at first my account of the
deaths of braun and mertaud and of nebos presumed
connection with them changed their attitude and they
agreed that it was imperative that my house have pro-
tection for at least the next few nights

  so a little less than two hours ago there arrived one
police-captain crail with four officers to captain
crail i recounted the whole matter and he agreed that
it was possible nebo and his associates might try to fire
the house to destroy me and my work as they had ap-
parently done with the german and french rocket-
experimenters

  captain crail suggested that he and his men take up
positions of hiding in the shrubbery around the house
and grounds and thus be able to apprehend nebo and
his companions if they approached the house i agreed
to the wisdom of this course and had barnett show them
to suitable places of hiding i then returned to my
study only a little easier in mind


amazing

stories

  that as i say was less than two hours ago crail
and his men have been hiding out there during this
time but apparently no one has approached the house
at crails orders one of the officers has come into the
house each quarter-hour to make sure of my safety
as all this has made me too nervous to sleep or work i
have spent the intervening time in writing to you my
dear arthur this account of what has happened my
reason for so doing is that i want you to leave your
classes at manhattan university and come down here
to stay with me for the next few days

  i realize that i have no right to draw you into any
danger that might threaten me but i have no one else
to turn to the police will be watching of course but
that is not like having a companion you will per-
haps feel surprised that i should experience such appre-
hension over the threats of this group of men but this
nebo made so strong an impression on me and the
record of the two space-rocket experimenters dying
shortly after his warnings is so close and sinister that
i cannot rid my mind of a certain foreboding

   barnett is waiting now to take this letter out to mail
and captain crails man has just come in again to see
that we are all right it is within a few hours of morn-
ing and i will be a great deal relieved and perhaps
less fearful when day comes but in the meantime
arthur i confess that you will make me feel much
better if on receiving this letter you will wire me that
you are coming

                   your affectionate uncle

ferdinand melford

chapter ii
account of arthur melford

professor von gersten having asked me
to draw up for our own consultation an account
of events from the time i received my uncles letter
until now i am doing so with the aid of some details
from captain crail and lloyd my close friend and
superior at manhattan university dr lloyd jackson
i am afraid that this precis will hardly serve to explain
the dark mystery that enmeshes us and that seems to
grow darker and more terrible with the passing of time
but it may help

  ten days ago i was living the more or less care-
free life of a physics instructor in the new york insti-
tution where ive held a post for the last three years
my chief concerns were the dinning into a couple of
hundred thick-headed sophomores the elementary facts
of electricity and magnetism and the equally tough
and fruitless struggle to bring my golf score under a
hundred then came my uncles letter and swift-follow-
ing on its heels-tragedy

  i receilved the letter of my uncle dj ferdinand
melford early on the morning of june nd i found it
in my mail when i arrived that morning at manhattan
university for an early final-exam i was giving as let-
ters from uncle were rather infrequent though our
relations were of the friendliest i opened and read it
at once

  i was astounded my uncles account of the threats
made against him by this peter nebo whoever he might
be and of the strange deaths of the other two space-
rocket experimenters braun and mertaud was startling
i did not wonder that uncle feared a like fate at the

hands of nebo and his group whatever their motives
and when i showed the letter to my superior lloyd
agreed with me that a real danger threatened dr
melford

  i was touched by my uncles half-apologetic request
that i stay with him for a few days certainly no one
had a better right to make such a request for uncle
ferdinand had taken the place of my dead parents in
my boyhood and youth had supervised my education
and guided my choice of a career more a father than
an uncle in my regard i did not hesitate a moment in
arranging to have a substitute give my classes their ex-
aminations for the next few days

  but before i left the university that morning the
tragedy came it arrived in the form of a telegram for
me which i reproduce herewith

dr ferdinand melford and servant killed

shortly before morning in fire that destroyed house

  please come to philadelphia immediately

                        crail police department

  an hour later i was on a train speeding southward
through the familiar new jersey cities and lloyd was
with me

  my dominating emotion was keen grief for my
uncle i had never realized how much the kindly elderly
scientist meant to me until i received that telegram
but before our train reached philadelphia i had set
aside for the time my emotion and was discussing with
lloyd the most important fact-the certainty that dr
melford had been murdered

  it was clear enough in view of his letter of the night
before nebo and his associates had carried out their
threat and uncle and his laboratory had been destroyed
just as had mertaud and braun it seemed incredible
that men could live who would commit a string of mur-
ders simply because of their objection to such an ab-
stract field of science as space-rocket research

  it was indisputable that that had been the cause of
uncles death though there remained the question
as to how he had met death while supposedly under
police protection i meant to investigate that problem
too

  when lloyd and i debarked at the broad street sta-
tion that afternoon we took a taxi and drove south-
westward across the city to the suburb in which lies the
philadelphia school of science not far from the
campus the cab turned into the extensive wooded
grounds of the old melford estate

  the grounds of the old place looked the same with
their big oaks and beeches and dense rather unkempt
shrubbery as when i had spent my boyhood there but
the rambling old frame mansion that had been the home
of several generations of melfords was reduced to a
pile of debris in which several policemen and plain-
clothesmen were searching

  one of the latter came over to lloyd and me as we
got out of our cab he was a keen-faced man of mid-
dle age whose expression had now a certain tenseness
and haggardness

  im captain crail he told me youll be young
mr melford

  yes and this is dr jackson i said my uncles
body

  it and the servants remains what there is of them
have been removed to a mortuary captain crail said
space-rocket murders



  what about this peter nebo and his associates  i
demanded have you caught them yet

  crail shook his head no we havent though weve
got a net spread for nebo over this whole end of the
country

  i understand that you and four of your men were
watching the place at the time this happened i said

  captain crail nodded his face unhappy we were
and thats what makes me feel worst on the thing five
of us here to protect dr melford-and he and the
servant killed in spite of us

  but im not sure that five hundred men around the
house would have saved your uncle whoever this
nebo and his pals may be they fired the place in a way
that we cant even guess yet

  it happened at three in the morning less than an
hour after your uncle sent that letter to you i and my
four men were hiding in the shrubbery right around
the house here and no one could possibly have gotten
within fifty feet of the place without being seen by us

  to tell the truth i didnt really think there was much
danger threatening your uncle from your uncles ac-
count i judged this nebo as just another crank who
but cranks would want to stop scientists from monkey-
ing with rockets  but the thing was too serious to take
chances on in view of what your uncle told us about the
german and french scientists who had been killed so
we were watching

  id told wilkes one of my men to go in every
fifteen minutes and make sure your uncle was all right
not that i had any idea anybody could get through
us to the house but i just didnt want to take any
chances from where i was hidden i could see wilkes
go in each time and about two oclock i saw barnett
come out and mail the letter your uncle had written to
you

arnett returned in a few minutes and every-
thing was quiet at three oclock wilkes went in
as usual on the quarter-hour and he reports your uncle
was writing in his study with his dog beside him and
barnett was sitting in the hall two minutes after
wilkes came out it happened

  the house simply exploded into flame i never saw
anything like it-one minute the house was a big darker
bulk in the darkness and the next it was a single sheet
of flame roaring upward as though every particle in
the place had taken fire at the same instant

  we ran toward it but to enter that roaring furnace
would have been suicide your uncle and the servant
must have been dead immediately-we never even heard
a cry from them we ran around the grounds looking
for anyone who might have started it but there was
no one not even a car was in sight though one of
my men janney says he did hear a whirring noise as
of a car speeding away

  the place was burned down to ashes quicker than
anything i ever saw before even before the firemen got
here if it had been soaked in gasoline and filled with
gunpowder it couldnt have burned faster-it was more
an explosion of fire than burning

  i had them get the radio-cars into this district and
comb it for signs of nebo or other suspicious-looking
characters but they found no one meanwhile nebos
description was sent out to all nearby cities on the tele-
types and that may get us some line on him yet i
sent cables also to the berlin and paris police for dope

on the braun and mertaud deaths and then wired you
the news

  captain crail looked squarely at me now before
anything else mr melford i want-you to tell me
straight whether you think i and my men were negli-
gent in failing to prevent your uncles death

  i shook my head slowly it seems that there is no
way in which you could have prevented what happened
i said but what i want to know is what did happen 
how did nebos band fire the place so swiftly and ap-
parently invisibly

  crail spread his hands helplessly mr melford
the things as much a mystery to us as it is to you
there seems no way to explain it for ill take oath
they werent on the grounds

  maybe they dropped an incendiary bomb from a
low-flying airplane lloyd suggested you said one
of your men heard a whirring sound

  the police-captain shook his head they couldnt
have done that dr jackson it was the darkest kind
of night last night and no plane even at its slowest
speed could locate a house accurately enough for that
also a planes motor is unmistakable and wed all have
heard it as it was only janney thought he heard a
low whirring

  we looked at each other then at the men still indus-
triously delving in the ashes the thing was baffling
the more so as i could see no rational motive for it all

  it seems unbelievable that any men should feel so
strongly on the subject of preventing travel to other
planets that theyd kill two or three space-rocket experi-
menters simply to stop research along that line i
exclaimed nebo and his associates must have some
other motive for these killings

  im not so sure captain crail replied madmen
will do unpredictable things and i believe that nebo
and his companions however many of them there may
be are all mad

  madmen who all have the same delusion i said
skeptically madmen who can execute crimes like
these 

  yet madmen they are in my belief crail persisted
madmen whose crazed brains have somehow acquired
the idea that for men ever to travel to other worlds
would be unholy and forbidden and who are deliber-
ately murdering all workers on space-rocket and other
experimenters who might further interplanetary travel

  ive wired asylums here and abroad asking informa-
tion on any patients released or escaped in the last ten
years with delusions on that subject im expecting an
answer from them and also from the berlin and paris
police on the braun and mertaud cases we might go
back into town to headquarters and see what they
answer

  we agreed to captain crails suggestion and after he
had ordered his men to continue searching the ashes for
possible clues we drove in with him to the police de-
partment building

  in crails little office two lengthy cablegrams and
some shorter messages were awaiting him and he read
them to lloyd and me

  the cablegrams were from the berlin and paris police
and gave the details of the deaths of dr richard
braun and of henri mertaud dr brauns death had
occurred two years before he had a rocket workshop
at the edge of a berlin airport and it had been seen one
night to burst suddenly into violent flames destroying


amazing stories

braun and most of his work the police-theory had
been that some of his rocket-fuels had taken fire or ex-
ploded suddenly

  the same theory was held by the parisian depart-
ment in regard to henry mertauds death four months
back mertauds field-laboratory had been outside
paris but his model and testing-laboratory had been in
the heart of paris a small two-story brick structure it
too had been seen at night to explode abruptly into fire
and only the charred remnants of mertauds body had
been found in it

  the shorter wires were from various asylums and
bureaus replying that they had no record of any patients
with delusions as to interplanetary travel having ever
been released or escaped

  captain crail tossed the messages down upon his desk
which advances us not at all he said we knew
nebo and his band killed braun and mertaud and now
were sure they did it in the same way that they fired
dr melfords place but thats all

  no reports of nebos presence have come in from
neighboring cities lloyd asked and crail shook his
head

  not one youd think the man had vanished into
thin air and until we get him weve no chance of
laying hands on whatever associates he may have

  we three were staring rather helplessly at each other
and night had fallen when a card was brought in to
captain crail

  professor herman von gersten berlin read crail
what does he want

  he says its about the death of dr melford said
his assistant and we all started a little

  send him in at once captain crail directed 

professor herman von gersten proved
to be a thick-set man of middle age with short
curly blond hair eyes that were as keen as crails
behind his thick-lensed glasses and a deceptively in-
genuous face

  crail greeted him and briefly introduced lloyd and
me von gerstens eyes lit when crail named me

  so the nephew of the unfortunate dr melford
he said that is good that i meet you so soon

  i understand youre here about dr melfords mur-
der-youve got something to tell us asked captain
crail hopefully

on the contrary answered von gersten i am
here investigating that murder as i have been investi-
gating when time allowed me for the last eight years
the last eight years crail repeated why dr
melford was only killed last night

  you misunderstand the german informed him
it is not dr melfords death i have been investigating
in these eight years but the deaths of other men who
have died as he died-and for the same reason

  you mean mertaud and braun i put in and the
teuton turned quickly toward me

  ah so already you know that dr melfords death
and those of mertaud and braun are connected

  we know yes i said and would have continued
but crail intervened

  just a moment professor he said id like first
to know if you are an authorized investigator or police-
agent

  for answer von gersten drew from his breast-pocket
a small blue card he handed to crail with a bow

  i hold a chair in the berliner polytechnik institut
he said but have also a post in the criminal science
department of the berlin police

  good enough captain crail remarked as he handed
the card back and you want us to tell you the de-
tails of dr melfords death

  i do yes von gersten said when you have told
me it may be that there are things that i can tell
you a fair exchange of information not so he
beamed upon the three of us

  well the facts as to dr melford are soon told
captain crail said gloomily if the newspapers had
them instead of thinking the thing accidental as they
do theyd be headlining it

  he briefly recounted the facts and von gersten lis-
tened with utmost attention when crail had finished
the germans blue eyes were keen as sword-blades

  it is as i feared he said had i landed in this
country yesterday instead of today i could have saved
your uncle

  you knew then that an attempt to murder him would
be made crail shot at him

  i knew the possibility of that von gersten amended
one week ago i read in the excellent journal of the
association for the promotion of science an article
by dr melford on space-rocket work mentioning his
work with rocket-fuels and also the space-rocket ex-
periments of a dr winn of detroit

  i saw that article and i went straight and bought
a ticket for america on the next boat i landed in
new york today intending to go to philadelphia to
dr melford but in the newspaper i read an article
describing dr melfords death in a fire that had his
house destroyed i knew then that they-those whom
you call neb and his associates-had struck even sooner
than i had expected

  you were going then to warn dr melford that nebo
and the rest would be after him crail asked

  von gersten bowed yes for i knew that so
soon as they learned of the rocket-researches of dr
melford and also of dr winn they would act to stop
them and i had a plan as to that

  but who is this devil nebo i interrupted you
must know that if you know so much about this

  the german looked gravely at me yet i do not
know that mr melford who is nebo how many
associates has he where is his home or base i
know no more than you

  but i have followed the work of this man and his
companions for eight years and do know something
i know that nebo who has used the names of smart
wladolowski cametto and others indiscriminately and
his associates have murdered at least eleven scientific
experimenters in these eight years

  eleven i exclaimed eleven scientists cold-
bloodedly wiped out by this madman and his band 

  i am not so sure myself that he is a madman von
gersten said but i will tell you briefly of nebos
record

  you have heard of willem van hijnn the dutch
engineer who was the pioneer in space-rocket research
he who sent small rockets higher into the stratosphere
than any before him had ever done well van hijnn
died eight years ago as perhaps you remember and
he died as dr melford died-in a fire that swept his
workshop

  van hijnn was a friend of mine and i was in
space-rocket murders



amsterdam at his funeral i suspected nothing any
more than anyone else until i came across a diary he
had left in his bedroom at home in it two days be-
fore he died van hijnn had recorded how a man named
wladolowski a strange-looking man with unnaturally
white face and green eyes had called on him and warned
him he must stop his work with space-rockets nebo of
course under a different name

 naturally van hijnn had refused-and two days
later he was destroyed that arousedmy suspicions
yet try as i might i could get no further trace of the
so-called wladolowski i forgot the occurrence until
two years later when the englishman fexil morrow
perished morrow was a london author who had taken
up and gone on with van hijnns space-rocket experi-
ments because of his intense interest in the possibility
of traveling to the moon or to some planet

 morrow had a thames-side workshop with a trained
technical assistant and had made a hobby of his space-
rocket models his workshop too puffed into flame
one night-always at night mark-and he and his as-
sistant were burned to death i read of that and would
have thought nothing of it had not the newspaper men-
tioned the efforts of the london police to trace an odd-
looking green-eyed man who had had some sort of
altercation with morrow the night before the fire

 at once i remembered the case of van hijnn was
this then the man who had had the argument with
morrow the wladolowski who had threatened van
hijnn i went to london to investigate and i
learned that this time the green-eyed man had given his
name as smart after leaving morrows place he had
been seen to join three companions a little along the
street

 this meant thatmy wladolowski or smart was not
working alone but had associates how many of them he
had or has i cannot guess by that time i was con-
vinced that morrow and his assistant were murdered to
stop them from continuing their space-rocket research
just as van hijnn had been this must mean a
group of madmen was at large so strongly infected with
the delusion that space-travel was unholy that they
would kill to prevent it from ever being brought about

 the next space-rocket experimenter to meet death
was krasny of buda-pesth eight months later then
over a year afterward two japanese scientists who had
advanced a scheme for -firing a projectile to another
world from a huge cannon sunk into the earths crust
were slain in their tokio laboratory in both cases
that of krasny and of oyumi and shota a visit from
a caller easily identifiable as your nebo or my wladol-
owski had preceded their deaths and in both cases the
experimenters perished by fire

 in the years since then six more scientists were
destroyed dr william hayes the australian scientist
who was at work on a new kind of successive-firing
rocket was next as usual his death was by fire
though in his case i could not trace any call by nebo
beforehand i am sure that such a call took place how-
ever as these murderers seem punctilious in warning
their victims and giving them a chance to stop their
research

 after hayes followed the death of serge wil-
soff of the soviets moscow laboratories wilsoff
had been trying to devise rockets for passenger-traffic
over oceans and had turned to consideration of the
launching of one into space quickly came the warning

to stop such research then when the warning was
disregarded came death by fire very shortly after l
molokoff who took up wilsoffs work met the same
fate and in the last two years have followed the
similar deaths of dr braun of henri mertaud and now
of dr melford

  in each case von gerstens eyes were glittering as
he drove home his point-in each case the murder was
done by firing the laboratory workshop or home of the
scientist in question in my opinion that is done so
the man and his work would perish together in no case
was the method of firing discoverable but every time it
happened during the night

  also in each case the scientist was given a chance
to stop his work nebo under one name or another
called on them and warned them that all research leading
toward space-travel must halt all of the eleven disre-
garded this warning and all have died

  i might have been able to save some of them by
warning them but in no case have i had time for in
every instance the warning and the murder took place
almost directly after it had become publicly known that
the scientist in question was engaged in space-rocket
research evidently nebo and his companions constantly
scan scientific journals and newspapers and miss no
such news and evidently they act at once on learning
of it

  von gersten leaned back spread his hands there
you have the story he said simply eleven experi-
menters slain by this nebo and his band-a remorseless
relentless group who have determined apparently that
space-travel never shall take place and a group who
have eluded all efforts at discovery

  crail and lloyd and i had listened to von gersten in-
tently and with deepening perplexity

  by god its unbelievable captain crail exclaimed
a bunch of lunatics running down eleven scientists like
that

  but are they lunatics  lloyd asked professor von
gersten can these men really have no other motive for
this list of murders than a common delusion

  the german shook his head slowly many times i
have asked myself that question he admitted some-
times it seems to me that only the craziest of lunatics
would such murders commit and at other times i
seem to sense behind these crimes some great
mystery whose edge we do not even approach

  well whatever is the motive of nebos group
its up to us to catch them said captain crail have
you any idea as to how that could be done 

  von gerstens head bobbed i do have an idea one
that brought me to america he said i meant to try
it with dr melford but it is not too late-we can try it
with the doctor winn the other rocket-experimenter
dr melford mentioned in his magazine-article

  my idea was this that nebos group would sooner
or later approach dr melford when they learned of
his space-rocket work and warn him to stop it as they
have always given warning i meant to persuade dr
melford to have men ready at all times with him to
seize this nebo or whatever name he might give when he
came to give his warning

  it is too late as i say to carry out that plan with
dr melford but we can do it with dr winn sooner
or later nebo and his associates will warn dr winn
as they did dr melford to stop the space-rocket work
we will get dr winn to keep about him out of sight


amazing stories

policemen who will seize nebo when he calls upon him
thats a real idea professor exclaimed captain
crail his eyes kindling i never thought of it but itll
give us a real chance of getting nebo and once we have
him we can soon get the rest of them

  but hadnt you better communicate with dr winn
at once about it lloyd asked theres no telling
how soon your nebo might visit him now that dr
melford is disposed of

  thats right crail said ill get dr winn on the
phone now-once he agrees to the plan we can go up
there to detroit and be waiting with him when nebo
shows up

  he grasped the telephone and in a few minutes the
connection to detroit had been put through the
detroit central reported that dr winns home had in-
formed her that the scientist was this night in his lab-
oratory in one of the buildings of detroit scientific
college and that she would connect us with him there

  in a few moments more in fact a thin and some-
what impatient voice was audible from the receiver
captain crail held

  this is dr harris winn it stated what is it
dr winn this is the philadelphia police depart-
ment captain crail speaking said crail you read of
dr melfords death 

  yes yes-a sad accident answered winn mel-
ford was a brilliant man but what are you calling me
about 

  we are certain that dr melfords death was not
an accident crail told him swiftly we believe that
the murderer or one of them may call on you sometime
soon and we want to arrange that he be detained if he
does so

  the murderer of dr melford call on me why in
the world should he

  dr melford was murdered by a group of madmen
or fanatics of some sort who are bitterly opposed to all
scientific research into space-rockets which might lead
to space travel crail explained their leader who
named himself peter nebo warned dr melford shortly
before his murder to stop such research and we believe
nebo may give you a similar warning

  but ive already had a warning of that sort-this
very afternoon replied dr winn

  we jumped to our feet you have cried crail
who gave it to you-what happened

  it was a man who called himself walter ennis re-
plied dr winn a short stocky person

  did he have an unusually pallid face and green eyes 
cried crail

  yes that describes him exactly he told me some
fol-de-rol about an organization opposed to space-rocket
experimentation and demanded that i stop my researches
i showed him the door

  dr winn that was peter nebo-the head of the
group that killed dr melford and almost a dozen other
scientists in the same line of research cried captain
crail

  tell him to at once leave his laboratory to hide in
another part of town exclaimed von gersten his blue
eyes blazing he is in most deadly danger

get out of your laboratory out of the building
crail told the scientist on the other end of the wire
at any moment nebos group may carry out their
threat and destroy you as they did melford and the rest
but i dont understand   we heard dr winn start

to say when he broke off suddenly then from the re-
ceiver in his voice came a high scream that mingled with
a loud roaring sound my god its    

  what is it yelled crail into the transmitter
whats happening

  the receiver was silent as the grave crail jabbed the
hook fiercely as von gersten and lloyd and i pressed
tensely to him operator shouted crail whats
the matter with that line

  i dont know it just went dead replied the detroit
operators voice just a moment please and ill find
out whats the matter

  in a silence of utter suspense we four waited in the
little philadelphia office our minds all at the detroit end
of the wire it was not one moment but many before
we heard the detroit operators voice again this time
excited

  your line went dead in a fire she reported the
building of detroit scientific college in which your con-
nection was is reported as having burst into flames and
is already half-destroyed they say

  what about our party what about dr winn cried
captain crail

  theres a report that there were only two men in the
building-a professor and a janitor-and that the fire
was so sudden that neither escaped the operator
answered if youll hold the line ill get the names for
you    

  but captain crail set the telephone down on the desk
softly and turned to us his face was very white
this time too professor von gersten he said you
have been just a little too late dr winn is dead

  von gerstens eyes now were cold steely the
twelfth man dead at the hands of nebos gang yes he
nodded and the only chance we had of capturing
nebo-gone

chapter iii
account o captain james grail

being a policeman and not a writing man i
didnt want at all to draw up this recountal of
the events in this case that followed the murder
of dr winn but the others young melford and pro-
fessor von gersten and dr jackson having insisted
that i was best fitted to do so i am taking it on
therell be no more literary polish in it though than in
any police report

  ill admit that i was rather knocked off my feet on
that night of june nd when we four in my office heard
of the destruction of dr winn and his laboratory in
the detroit college it had never occurred to me that
nebo and his pals might strike again so quickly after
their murder of dr melford and i felt a certain re-
sponsibility for not having warned dr winn

  also i still felt responsible more or less for the
murder of dr melford of course as arthur mel-
ford had agreed nebos band must have used some un-
heard-of way to fire dr melfords house and a hundred
policemen around it would apparently have done no
more than we did to prevent it but just the same no
policeman who is called on for protection likes to see
the man hes protecting murdered under his nose and
thats what had happened to dr melford

  it made me determined to get this lunatic nebo and
whatever nuts might be trailing with him if it took
space-rocket murders



me ten years that began to look like more of a job
when this von gersten appeared and told us of the num-
ber of space-rocket experimenters and scientists that
nebos group had killed in the last eight years but
the idea of nabbing him through dr winn brightened
things up for me

  the destruction of dr winn that took place literally
within our hearing though he was in detroit and we in
philadelphia blasted our hopes in that direction

 the first news given us by the detroit operator was
soon supplemented by the detroit police

  according to them the building at detroit scientific
college in which dr winn was had simply puffed into
flame from top to bottom winn and the other man in
it the janitor had no chance to escape

 no cars had been seen leaving the place during or
after the fire and no one had reported seeing a man of
the description of peter nebo the detroit police
promised to get a dragnet out for him at my request
but i had small hopes of their success

 when i finished talking to them i looked at the
others young melford and dr jackson were rather
white but professor von gersten seemed more keenly
disappointed than shaken

 gone-the chance to catch that demon he ex-
claimed had dr winn known sooner he could have
had men there to seize nebo when he visited him this
afternoon

 theres no use going over what might have been i
told him the thing to do is to get on the trail of
nebo and the rest before they spring any more of these
murders

 von gersten shook his head my friend there will
be no more murders in the immediate future he as-
sured me for the simple reason that melford and
winn were the only outstanding space-rocket experi-
menters and that until new experimenters take up the
problems of interplanetary travel and attract the atten-
tion of these madmen they will have no cause to act

 but when we next hear of such scientists taking up
space-rocket research we will not delay we will sur-
round them with men who can seize whichever of nebos
group appears to warn them and once we have some
of them if only one we can search out the others

 then thats what youre going to do-wait until
other scientists take up space-rocket work and use
them to trap nebo arthur melford asked von
gersten nodded

 it is all that can be done it may mean a long wait
but sooner or later the chance will come and then we
will maybe end once and for all this organization of mad
murderers

 i stared at the three of them say you three may
be swell scientists but ill say youd make poor cops i
said to talk about waiting maybe for years until
some other scientists take up the rocket-research

 what else is there to do arthur melford asked

 do i repeated didnt you ever hear of the
gentle art of framing dont you suppose that nebo
and his fellow-nuts can be framed as well as any gang-
ster or gunman

 frame nebo said melford his face lit up i
think i see what you mean you mean to get some
scientist to give out that he is seriously engaged in
space-rocket experiments and that that will   

 will come to the attention of nebo and his asso-
ciates and theyll think its straight i finished for them

and when they call on the scientist in question to give
him their usual polite warning about stopping his ex-
periments before bumping him off theyll run into a
bunch of hidden men they wont have a chance in the
world to get away from

  it is superb cried von gersten captain crail i
congratulate you-this will mean their capture

  well save the congratulations until were in the
clear i told him the first thing to do is to fix it
up for some scientist to publish a lot of stuff about his
important space-rocket experiments it ought to be
a scientist of first-class standing too so that nebo and
his gang wont suspect camouflage

  youll find it rather hard to get a scientist of stand-
ing to put out such a story predicted dr jackson
scientists are so jealous of their scientific reputations
that most of them would refuse to take a chance of im-
pairing their standing by issuing untrue statements
i grinned at him i know that but i know one
scientist of first-rate standing wholl do it i think his
names dr lloyd jackson

  i said jackson startedly you want me to an-
nounce ive been experimenting with space-rockets
then 

  yes i do i said youve got enough scientific
position to make nebo group believe your statements
theyll cotoe to warn you before trying anything-they
always have-and as i said well be ready night and day
to grab them when they come

  dr jackson reflected for a moment all right ill
do it he answered

  thanks lloyd said arthur melford gratefully ill
be there to take any chances you have to take

  we all will i agreed now what statements are
you going to issue  they ought to be strong enough to
make nebo and the rest sure to come you know

  if you will permit a suggestion said von gersten
keenly why not say that you have developed a method
of producing atomic power immense power from the
controlled disintegration of atoms and that you intend to
use it first in a space-rocket to reach the nearer planets 

arthur melford nodded quickly that
would bring nebo and the rest if anything would
for that would mean if it were true an immense sci-
entific step forward in the possibility of interplanetary
travel

  dr jackson made a wry face itll mean my scien-
tific reputation going to shreds too when i announce
it he said atomic power but im with you on it
good i said now i suggest that you return to
new york immediately dr jackson and about two
days from now make that announcement to the news-
papers it ought to get publicity enough

  well be up there with you from the time you an-
nounce that on in the meantime ill arrange to get
leave here and to take a couple of my own men with
me and mr melford can carry out his uncles funeral
ceremonies as i suppose he wants to do

  i believe all of us including professor von gersten
should be careful not to be seen with you after the an-
nouncements are made lest nebo and his pals become
suspicious so well join you just before you give out
your statements and stay with you hidden until nebo
shows up

  you have some sort of private laboratory at man-
hattan university i suppose i added


amazing stories

  dr jackson nodded yes a fair-sized one on the
top-floor of the building of physical science

  well you can in your statements let drop the fact
that your model space-rockets and atomic power formulae
and all that are in your private laboratory and that
youre working there night and day in that way nebo
will know where to find you and the rest of us can lie
hidden there and when he shows up well grab him if
we have to kill him to do it

  these were the arrangements which after a little
more discussion we adopted dr jackson returned to
new york that night

 von gersten and arthur melford remained in
philadelphia with me and on the next day june rd
was held the funeral of the remains of dr melford and
his servant both von gersten and i attended with
young melford

  on the morning of the th we three left for new
york with us being three of my men wilkes janney
and mccloskey the chief had allowed them and me
indefinite leave for the time the case required no doubt
the new york police would have cooperated to the ex-
tent of furnishing a couple of men but to ask them
meant giving out the whole story of what was still to the
newspapers only a couple of accidental fires

  we reached new york before noon and went straight
out to manhattan university on the northern heights
of the island the big place had rather a deserted look
as the regular school-year was ended and summer-school
had not yet begun	

  young melford led us to the building of physical
science a big square gray-stone building at the campus
western edge we went in and up to the private labor-
atory of dr jackson where he was awaiting us

  there was a small office at one end of the laboratory
and it was there that we meant to watch and wait in
shifts after the announcements were made for the ap-
pearance of nebos group jackson had placed a couple
of cots and some tinned foods in this office as our
wait might extend for days

  after i had pronounced it all satisfactory and we
had settled down in the office dr jackson telephoned the
four leading new york newspapers and said he had
some important news to give out they appreciated
jacksons standing and promised to send out reporters
at once in fact four reporters and a photographer ap-
peared in less than an hour dr jackson received them
in the laboratory but we had opened the office-door a
crack and could see from our hiding-place in the office
as he gave out his statement

  i was afraid that dr jacksons natural repugnance
to giving out untrue statements might make him play his
part badly but he rose to the occasion in an impressive
way he told them that he had solved the secret of pro-
ducing power from the disintegration of atoms and
that he meant to use this atomic power in a new-design
of space-rocket that he was going to build

  the reporters were much excited could you give
some sort of demonstration dr jackson one pleaded
this is going to create a great sensation

  i fully intend to give a demonstration of my dis-
covery jackson told them but to demonstrate this
atomic power on other than a minute scale i will have
to arrange a field-laboratory in some less thickly-inhab-
ited region than this the forces released by this process
are too powerful to take chances with

  but doctor why are you applying your discovery

to the construction of space-rockets instead of to more
ordinary purposes asked another atomic power
will revolutionize the world if it is applied to industry
i know that said dr jackson seriously but i
consider the space-rocket question the possibility of
bringing about travel to other worlds of the greatest im-
portance i mean to use this atomic power i have de-
veloped in this way first

  there were other questions from the reporters shot
at jackson so rapidly that he could hardly answer them
he promised a demonstration of the atomic power
within a few weeks-as soon as he had devised an easier-
cantrolled apparatus he also told them that he was
working every day and most of the night at the task of
designing an atomic-powered space-rocket

  they left obviously anxious to return with their
stories and jackson came back to the office where we
were hidden

  you heard that bunch of pseudo-science i handed
them he said at least it ought to make a great
newspaper-story

  arthur melford laughed it will lloyd i can
hear now some of the comments your scientific con-
freres will be making when they read of your wonder-
ful discovery

  yes i know about what theyll call me said jackson
ruefully but you think itll bring nebo

  it certainly should declared von gersten if they
hunted down those other scientists simply because they
were experimenting with space-rockets they will cer-
tainly come here when they hear you have discovered a
source of atomic power to use in such a rocket

  theyll come i agreed and when they do come
weve got to be ready from now on at least two of ua
will always be awake and watching and we all have our
guns when nebo and his pals do show up they wont
get away

there began then a strange wait i decided that
four of us in two shifts of two were enough to
wait in the office off the laboratory and so i had two of
the men janney and mccloskey post themselves at the
front and rear entrances respectively of the buildings
ground floor to the caretaker in charge of the unused
building jackson explained that these were men he had
hired to protect him from curiosity-seekers

 the other four of us von gersten arthur melford
wilkes and i remained in the little office we were all
armed and as two of us would always be watching the
laboratory where jackson was all would be ready for
nebos welcome

  the new york newspapers on the night of june th
gave considerable front-page space to the startling an-
nouncement jackson had made to the reporters we
read the articles that night jackson having had the
caretaker bring in copies of all the papers

  dr jacksons statement sensational enough by ltselfe
was made even more sensational by the newspapers
treatment they enlarged on what his discovery of
atomic power would mean if it proved to be all he stated
electricity and steam a sources of power would be
scrapped a handful of coal could run a steamship around
the world and the like and even more wonderful dr
jackson meant to use atomic power first in launching a
rocket into space toward other worlds

  the writers here drew highly imaginative pictures of
jacksons atomic rocket touring the worlds of the solar
space-rocket murders



system of possible inhabitants on such planets as mare
or venus of a future line of atomic rockets plying be-
tween the various planets and earth it being presumed
that terrestrial colonies would soon be established on the
planets that proved habitable all this would result from
dr jacksons discovery

  the scientists who had been asked for their com-
ments were of different opinions some said it was
quite possible that dr jackson had devised a way of
obtaining atomic power but that the idea of making its
first use the actuating of a space-rocket was unsound
others stated outright that they did not believe the
alleged discovery most of those who were asked rather
hedged on the question generally though there was
an air of disbelief among the savants

  but the public or at least a great portion of it seemed
to believe for there began that very night an influx
of curiosity-seekers cranks reporters and inventors that
lasted for the next four days they streamed up into
the laboratory to question and bother dr jackson and
he had perforce to let them all be admitted since we
could not tell when among them might come nebo and
his associates

  in those four days we continued the most monot-
onous of existences two of us in the little office keeping
watch on the laboratory and jackson while the other two
slept it was not so monotonous for jackson himself
because confined by our plot to the laboratory he occu-
pied himself in work of his own that i suppose his
visitors thought was part of the space-rocket and atomic-
power researches in those four days he did not leave
the laboratory

  on the fifth day his stream of visitors had slackened
a good deal for the first sensation caused by jacksons
statements had by then faded out a little we remained
constantly on the watch it was my belief that by this
time nebos group would certainly have read of dr
jacksons wide-heralded discovery and plans and that
they would not delay long in putting in an appearance

  on the evening of the fifth day we ate together a
somewhat sketchy dinner and then dr jackson went
back into the laboratory to continue his work while
von gersten and i kept watch it was wilkes and
young mel fords turn to sleep von gersten and i sat
close together near the crack of the just-opened door
within full view of the brightly-lit laboratory where
jackson pottered with his flames and test-tubes

  it was a little bit before midnight that there sounded
a knock at the laboratorys outer door jackson went
to open it and i saw two men step quickly inside im-
mediately i sensed that these were not ordinary visitors
for they had not been announced by the caretaker in
charge below and as they stepped into the lighted
laboratorys full illumination i saw that the end of our
wait was at hand

 the foremost of the two men was peter nebo i
needed but one glance at his squat figure dressed in a
good-quality dark suit his dose-cut black hair un-
naturally dead-white face and hands and green eyes to
identify him

  and his companion might have been his twin brother
for this other man also was stocky dark-haired white-
faced and green-eyed i rose to my feet eyeing nebo
tensely through the crack in the door and with my gun
out in my hand von gersten too had seen and with
eyes gleaming behind his glasses had risen gun in hand

  i saw that dr jackson also recognized his callers

but he betrayed no sign of any prior knowledge

  you are dr lloyd jackson asked peter nebo
politely my name is clark and i and my brother wish
to see dr jackson

  jackson nodded what is it you want gentlemen
he asked calmly i am dr jackson

  we wished to learn dr jackson said nebo if
it is true as the newspapers stated that you have dis-
covered a method of producing practical atomic power
and intend to utilize it to propel a space-rocket

  yes the newspaper accounts were substantially cor-
rect jackson told him i have been successful in
developing such power and mean to use it first in that
way

  in the next moment things happened with bewilder-
ing rapidity i had been ready to burst out into the
laboratory with von gersten and confront and capture
nebo and his companion i had fully expected that he
would go on to warn dr jackson that he must halt his
space-rocket research as he had done in the other cases

  instead peter nebo uttered a quick cry in some un-
known tongue and at the same moment he and his
companion grasped dr jackson and hastened with him
to the laboratory door they were abducting jackson
instead of warning him i
instantly von gersten and i burst out and i shot
swiftly at nebos companion he dropped with a gut-
tural cry but as he did so a half-dozen squat white-faced
men rushed into the laboratory from the hall in answer
to nebos shout

  four of them grasped jackson and with nebo
dragged him out of the laboratory while the other two
delayed a moment to aim flat metal rods in their hands
toward us from the rods sprang thin jets of clear
liquid and though these jets missed von gersten and me
where they struck against the laboratorys wall the wall
burst suddenly into flame

  as the two ran out von gersten and i shot but
missed them in the smoke and flame pouring from the
laboratorys wall i heard the tread of running feet
ascending the hall stairs that led to the roof wilkes
and arthur melford burst from the office awakened by
the uproar pistols in their hands and janney and mc-
closkey came running up from below

  mccloskey-janney-get an extinguisher and put
that fire out before it spreads i yelled the rest come
on with me

iran into the hall and up the stairs melford and
von gersten beside me and wilkes following
whats happened young melford was shouting

  nebo and his gang-they took jackson up to the
roof	- -

  as we raced up the stairs we heard a whirring sound
quickly dying away above we burst out on the roof
and even in the darkness it took but an instant to see it
was empty 

  arthur melford yelled and pointed westward there
against the glow of the lights along the hudson we saw
momentarily a slim speeding shape of gleaming silver
that vanished even as we saw it
theyve got away with lloyd melford cried
they had a plane on this roof and have escaped in it
a plane i exclaimed then thats how they got
into the building coming down from the roof but how
did they ever land and take off a plane on this small
roof


amazing stories

  god knows but they did it somehow melford said

  mccloskey and janney emerged on the roof grimy
and panting we got the fire out they reported
did they get away with dr jackson 

  they did i said but why did they carry jackson
away instead of warning him to stop research as they
did all the other scientists has nebo taken him off to
kill him 

  no i think not von gersten interposed tell me
you saw that companion of nebos you killed and those
half-dozen others nebo called to his aid you saw that
they looked alike

  they all looked like nebo himself if thats what you
mean i told him squat white-faced green-eyed
-but what about it 

  i think it means much that von gersten declared
i think it may explain all this mystery that for eight
years has puzzled me quick we will go down and
examine that one you shot and whose body they left
where it dropped

  we went back to the laboratory which was badly
burned but was no longer burning the body of nebos
companion lay by the door where it had fallen and we
all knelt beside it

  seen so closely the man was very strange-looking
his green eyes stared up sightlessly at the ceiling a
round hole above one eye showing where my bullet had
gone his face and hands retained their unnatural dead-
whiteness

  von gersten rummaged in the pockets of the mans
clothing he drew out several objects we inspected
one of them was a flat metal rod with a trigger-like
catch at one end plainly one of the weapons that re-
leased the jets of liquid which had fired what matter they
had touched

  another object we turned over and over was an in-
tricate little cylindrical mechanism of wires and dia-
phragms none of us could fathom the other thing in
the mans pockets was an oblong silvery metal plate
several inches long on whose surface was engraved in
black an accurate mercators projection of the earths
surface

  superimposed on this map were a number of curving
lines that glowed with light as though marked by raditun-
paint these lines all radiated from a single point in
eastern labrador to some ten or twelve points dis-
tributed over the earths surface along each line was
an inscription in characters absolutely unfamiliar in ap-
pearance to all of us

  what does this earth-map mean i asked can
you make anything of it

  i can make something of it yes von gersten said in
a tone of repressed excitement but i make more of
this man himself than of what he carried in his pockets
-see

  we all gasped von gersten had grasped the dead
mans close-cut black hair and had suddenly pulled the
whole mass of it off the black hair was a wig and its
removal disclosed a moist-looking green-skinned head
and this bulbous green head was soft von gerstens
pressing thumb sinking into it an inch

  our bewilderment and horror deepened when the
german pulled off the dead mans clothing and we saw
that all his body except his face and hands was covered
with moist green skin also closer examination showed
that the whiteness of the face and hands was due to a
coat of white skin-paint having been applied to them for

when a little of this was scraped away the green skin
showed beneath

  this green-skinned body was quite inhuman in gen-
eral characteristics there seemed no skeleton in it
at all it having been supported instead by immensely
thick-grouped muscles the legs and arms in fact were
nothing more nor less than great tentacles that tapered
down at their extremities to semi-human fingers and
toes

  with hands that trembled a little von gersten pointed
out that the ears were quite different in inner-structure
from anything human and that the teeth in the mouth
were artificial ones apparently inserted to allow the re-
production of human speech-tones

  i have no doubt von gersten said that dissection
of this body will reveal that it is entirely boneless and
that the circulatory digestive and nervous systems
will be found radically different from the human

  he stood up the metal world-map with its glowing
lines in his hand we rose unsteadily also but then
what is this-this thing i asked shakenly its not
only like nothing human its like nothing ever known
on earth

  you are right there captain crail von gersten
said almost calmly although it seems to have de-
veloped a near-human form the species to which this
thing belongs cannot have developed under terrestrial

conditions

  you mean that this thing and the rest that nebo
and the others are    

  i mean that nebo and his associates cannot be crea-
tures of earth at all they are creatures of some other
world

chapter iv

account of dr lloyd jackson

in preparing this account of my capture and what
followed i have made painstaking efforts to adhere
scrupulously to fact even in the smallest details
the importance of so doing is obvious when it is rea-
lized as it now is that my capture at the hands of nebo
and his followers and what came after constitutes the
first conscious contact between the inhabitants of earth
and inhabitants of another world between humans and
intelligent non-humans

  that night when i opened the door of my laboratory
to the two callers who had knocked on it i had of course
no suspicion of the astounding truth but i did know
that i was facing peter nebo and one of his associates
the descriptions left no doubt-this squat man with
black hair unnaturally white face and green eyes could
be no other than the ring-leader of the group that had
killed a dozen space-rocket experimenters the other
was so much the same in appearance that i accepted
nebos ready explanation that it was his brother

  when i admitted in answer to their first question
that i had discovered a source of atomic power and
meant to use it in a space-rocket i fully expected to
hear nebo warn me to stop such research as he had
warned dr melford and all the others i knew that
captain crail and professor von gersten must be watch-
ing from the office at the laboratorys end and before
nebo finished his warning they and the others would
burst out and seize the two

but to my utter surprise no sooner had i made that
space-rocket murders



admission than nebo and the other had grasped me and
were rushing with me toward the door i heard a cry
from captain crail and a shot and nebos companion
loosed me and sank to the floor but nebo continued to
hold me with a strength that even then seemed to me
superhuman and in answer to his shout a half-dozen
figures like him poured in from the hall

  four of these grasped me also and i was lifted and
carried out of the laboratory with a swiftness and
strength i could not resist i heard cries from captain
crail and von gersten and heard too the sudden crackle
of flames as i was borne up the stairs toward the roof
with nebo urging his followers to greater swiftness in
deep cries in an unknown language we burst out onto
the roof

  in the darkness i was just able to see that i was
being borne toward a long torpedo-like metal craft that
rested on the roof i kicked and struggled but was
like a child in the hand of my captors they hurried
me to a round open door in the metal hulls side leapt
in with me and then as the last two to reach the roof
sprang in there was a whirring sound from the crafts
bottom and stern and through a small window in the
door i saw the roof dropping away as we darted into
the night

  nebo uttered a brief command and those holding me
abruptly released me i looked dazedly around

  the interior of the craft was undivided so that i stood
near the center of a sort of hollow metal submarine forty
feet long it was brightly lit inside and there were sev-
eral small windows

  the crafts interior was rather crowded by unfamiliar-
looking mechanisms and objects but in my first scrutiny
i was more intent upon the occupants

  a few feet from me stood peter nebo his coolly un-
emotional green eyes regarding me from his dead-white
face

  around me stood the half-dozen men who had helped
him carry me off with a creeping of the skin i now
discovered that all of them were replicas of nebo in
appearance green-eyed white-skinned black-haired and
squat-bodied all were watching me incuriously

  two other men exactly like the rest sat in the nose
of the craft at a control-board covered with rods and
small wheels

  i became aware that peter nebo was speaking he
spoke briefly in an unknown language to the men about
me at his orders all but two of them went to other
parts of the craft those two holding flat metal rods that
were obviously weapons of some nature remaining to
guard me

 nebo then spoke to me in english do not be
alarmed dr jackson he said to me calmly we have
no intention whatever of harming you

  why have you kidnaped me i asked rather un-
steadily who are you-where are you taking me

  to answer those questions may take rather more time
than you think he said i will content myself for the
present by saying that we have seized you in this fashion
for weighty reasons

  i was beginning to recover a little from my dazedness
the same reasons that induced you to kill a dozen other
scientists i suppose i shot at him

  there was a little surprise in the green eyes you
know that we killed them 

  yes i know that youve murdered a dozen space-
rocket experimenters from van hijnn to melford why

have you killed all these experimenters so ruthlessly

  nebo considered me for a minute with an unfathom-
able expression these things i will explain to you
shortly dr jackson he said in the meantime be
assured that no harm will come to you from us

  he turned from me and went to the nose of the craft
i saw him speak to the two men at the controls and
they answered

  then they shifted rods and turned wheels and i felt
the racing craft turn sharply in mid-air

  i half-raised myself to look through the little window
beside me far far below in the darkness i made out
two little beds of lights that i knew must be cities

  they sped backward so quickly that i knew the craft
was traveling at incredible speed though the only sound
was the ceaseless whirring of its operation and a thin
whine of winds outside

  looking upward at the stars i soon discovered that
we were traveling almost due north it was evident
that the craft had first flown westward and then after
having left new york well behind had now changed
course and headed north

i looked about in an effort to discover the source
of this strange crafts power ranged along its walls
were big cylindrical tanks and from these heavy tubing
or piping ran to the nose and stern of the craft and also
to its floor from the tubes that ran to the stern and
the floor came the soft whirring it was evidently these
that in some way were hurling the torpedo-like hull
through the air there were connections between all
the tubes and the control-board in the nose

  i also made out some smaller square tanks connected
to metal nozzles that were mounted just inside the win-
dows like so many machine-guns

  nebo came back from the crafts nose and saw me
staring about you are wondering how this flier oper-
ates he asked those cylindrical tanks hold certain
explosive gases compressed thousands of times

  these gases are released through those tubes from
openings outside the fliers hull being fired at the mo-
ment they are released their firing-recoil is of tremen-
dous force and the firing of the bottom or floor-tubes
raises and suspends the flier in air

  firing of the stern-tubes propels us forward and
similarly the nose-tubes can be used for braking pur-
poses

  i nodded it was in my mind to learn from nebo
as much as possible concerning this whole business

  what about those other tanks and nozzles  i asked
pointing to the square tanks with their gun-mounted
nozzles

  those nebo explained are tanks of liquid so
chemically compounded that almost any kind of non-
metallic matter it touches bursts into flame we use it
by projecting it from those nozzles and also have the
small hand-rod containers of it

  light broke in upon me with his words then thats
how you fired the laboratory-building of dr winn and
dr melfords house and all the rest i exclaimed

  yes we simply brought the flier on a dark night
over the building we wanted to destroy hovering a
little above it in the darkness we had only to turn a
few streams of the firing-liquid down on the building
below and instantly it went up in flames

  and thats how you did it i repeated i thought
of an airplane but an airplane couldnt have hovered


amazing stories

and would have been heard so     here i broke off

  i continued but why did you do it i demanded
why kill those dozen scientists and why carry me
away 

  dr jackson every one of those scientists we de-
stroyed was working on experiments that might help to
bring about interplanetary travel said peter nebo
simply

  we destroyed them after they refused to stop their
work because we are utterly opposed to such travel
taking place we will never while we can prevent it
permit the development of space-rockets or anything
else that will allow men to journey to other planets
but whats your reason for being so dead set against
men reaching other planets i exclaimed we thought
you were madmen with a delusion on the subject but
madmen couldnt have designed this flier and these other
things you must have some reason

  we have a reason dr jackson answered peter
nebo gravely and that reason is that we ourselves are
from another planet and that our race is determined that
men of earth shall never invade our world

  i stared at him for a moment my first reaction to
his astounding statement was that after all these men
were all mad but the very craft in which i was being
hurtled smoothly through the upper night the very un-
familiarity of all the things about me beat down this
idea and supported incredible as it was nebos assertion

  i know that it will be hard for you to understand
and believe nebo was going on but it is quite true
i and all my companions are natives of the planet that
you call venus

  you mean to tell me then that you came to earth
from venus i said hoarsely in this flier

  not in this flier peter nebo corrected this is
but one of the craft we use on venus and which we
brought with several others for use here on earth
the ship that brought us here from our world is
many times the size of this one and quite different
though it operates on the same principle of gas-firing
recoil as this little flier

  its unbelievable i said unsteadily you cant be
from another world-you men like myself

  we are not men like yourself dr jackson said
nebo quietly we are not men at all

  look and be assured for yourself he added and
turning gave a brief command to one of the men guard-
ing me

  at once the fellow reached up and to my surprise and
horror jerked off his close black hair in one mass a wig
in fact and disclosed a green-skinned soft head like
that of a seal

  he quickly then doffed his clothing i cannot express
the horror that was mine when i saw that his body also
was green-skinned and seal-like a soft boneless trunk
from which branched arms and legs that were in effect
huge feelers or tentacles like those of an octopus instead
of ordinary human limbs

  i saw then that the face and hands were white-painted
accounting for their unchanging dead-whiteness i saw
also that the only parts of this grotesque and unhuman
body that looked human at all were the hands and fingers
the face with its nose and mouth and ears and the eyes-
the parts of the body covered by ordinary clothing being
totally different from the human

the thing reassumed its clothing at nebos order
shaken sick i stared at nebo himself then all of

you are like-like that- i struggled with the words

  yes i am the same and so are all these others peter
nebo answered

  my god creatures wholly inhuman i exclaimed

  but creatures which i think you will have to admit
equal and surpass you humans in intelligence nebo
told me calmly

  but you passed as humans-you talk our lan-
guages- i said unable still to understand

  we did because it was necessary to fulfill our work
here on your world he said

  but what is your work the killing of scientists
here

  our work peter nebo said gravely is the pre-
vention of any scientific research on the part of you
humans which might lead to your attaining power to
visit our world

  that is why we have killed the space-rocket inventors
and other experimenters and that is why we have carried
you off like this dr jackson to understand fully our
motive you must understand something of our history

  his voice was very serious and thoughtful and as his
pale geen eyes looked calmly into mine and his deep voice
talked i could not realize that this was a non-human
creature of another world

as he spoke i sat half-crouching on the floor listen-
ing with a terrible tenseness the whirring of the
firing tubes never stopped as the flier drove unceasingly
northward through the upper night except for nebo
and my two guards the others in the craft were on watch
at either the controls or mechanisms

  our world the world that you have named venus
said peter nebo i could still think of him only by the
human name is a world very much unlike yours in
some respects it is of much the same size as your
earth and like it has a day of about twenty-four earth-
hours

  also like earth venus has an atmosphere with the
vital substances of carbon dioxide and oxygen present
in it though in somewhat different proportions but
the surface of our world differs very much from the
surface of this one

  venus has no moon at first that fact may not seem
important to you but it has made a great difference be-
tween the two worlds when earth was semi-molten it
flung off a great mass of its matter that became its moon
that caused irregularities of height in the surface of the
earth so that when its seas formed they ran into the
deeper basins and formed oceans while the higher areas
formed continents of dry land

  on venus on the contrary no moon having been
flung forth there have never been such irregularities of
level for that reason when our seas condensed from
the primeval hydrosphere of our planet they covered
almost the whole planet a few small islands alone re-
maining uncovered thus our world is predominantly
a watery world

  because of that evolution on venus has followed a
somewhat different course than on earth here life
originated in the seas and there developed its first crude
forms but very soon in its history life moved to the
land where it began the development of a multiplicity
of land-forms after ages of such land-development
one class of the vertebrates the mammals proved most
successful and after still more ages of variation and
selection one species of those mammals man developed
space-rocket murders



the real intelligence which has made wonderful progress

  but on venus the story of evolution was entirely
different there the great part of the history of life
was enacted in the waters and only comparatively late
in its history was the land invaded by any life for
there the land-masses were small and unpromising and
the seas were endless and bountiful in our world life
had developed to a comparatively high level and had
produced a species of creatures of some intelligence
before any living thing ventured on the land that
species of which i speak was ancestral to my own species

  back in those times of our earliest development in
the venerian seas there was little vertebrate development
conditions being different than those of your terrestrial
seas the chief development in so far as intelligence and
activity were concerned was among a class of creatures
akin to the cephalopods the octopods and squid of earth

  these creatures were four-armed capable of quick
motion through the waters and had considerable enter-
prise and strength they advanced rapidly in these
things until they dominated the seas and outmastered all
competing creatures their instincts widened into con-
sciousness and intelligence dim at first but slowly
growing

  they were water-breathing creatures special organs
in their bodies extracting the dissolved air from the
waters but they were able also to live for some time in
the air and to breathe air their ability to breathe air
soon enabled them to spend all their time on the land
they consciously desired to invade the land and gradually
they did it was a deliberate conquest of land much dif-
ferent from the instinctive invasion of land made long
ago by your ancestral forms of life on earth

  once on land the capabilities of these creatures
rapidly expanded they learned to walk on two of
their tentacle-limbs and to use the other two as arms for
manipulation purposes carrying their heads or brain-
cases erect above their bodies they quickly learned
the use of tools and built structures dwellings-a pro-
gress that would have been impossible had they remained
in the waters

  soon their numbers crowded the islands that were
the only land of venus and their structures had so in-
creased as to form cities they had designed vehicles
and mechanisms by then and weapons and their scien-
tific knowledge grew continually as the scientific spirit
took hold

  two thousand years ago while humans were still
mostly barbaric and knew nothing of science our race
had reached a fairly civilized state we were slowly
becoming conscious of the real scheme of the universe
of the admirability of truth we were and have been
ever since just a little ahead of you in scientific progress

  our speculations as to what lay outside the unchang-
ing cloud-screen that is our planets sky were unending
at last eight hundred years ago we developed an astron-
omical science which made it possible for us to look
through the cloud-screen by using telescopic and photo-
graphic instruments sensitive to infra-red rays that can
pass through the clouds

  that is how we came to see the sun and the other
worlds of the solar system and the stars gradually
there arose a desire among us to visit the nearer of the
other worlds the planet nearer the sun than us that
you call mercury was plainly uninhabitable but the
next one earth looked habitable to us and much we
desired to visit it

  so began experiments in space travel that continued
for a long time innumerable projectiles and rockets
were designed and launched but none were successful
at last two hundred years ago a ship designed on the
rocket-recoil principle proved workable and when
venus and earth were in inferior conjunction that ship
made its first successful trip

  that first venerian ship reached earth in what you
would call the first part of the eighteenth century but
the venerians before landing openly on earth carefully
reconnoitered its surface without themselves being seen
so that they might be sure there was no danger

  it was well for venus that they did so for they
saw that earth held a race of intelligence and knowledge
of science almost as great as the venerians and a race
whose millions far outnumbered ours they saw that
this race of man had devised the most destructive wea-
pons of which their science was capable and that with
these weapons they fought unceasingly among them-
selves striving to subdue each other and slaying each
other in hosts

  this was enough to give the venerian explorers
pause what would happen they asked themselves if
they landed among these races of men and told them
they came from venus would these fierce hostile
hordes not see at once in venus new lands to conquer
would they not attempt to duplicate the venerians ship
and travel across the void to attack the venerians

  it might take them a long time to duplicate the vener-
ians feat of space-travel but they could undoubtedly
succeed eventually once they had knowledge of that
other world and the possibility of reaching it these
restless beings would not halt until they had done so
and would that contact between humans and venerians
not inevitably mean bloody combat

ith these things in mind the first venerian ex-
plorers did not make their presence known to
the men of earth instead they headed back to venus
and the people of earth never even suspected their visit
when they reached venus they made detailed report
to the venerian leaders of what they had seen

  their report was given much attention it was finally
decided that the venerians should never let the men of
earth know of their existence for though our science
was greater than that of the humans though we could
no doubt repel them if they tried to attack us yet there
were thousansd of them to every venerian and it might
mean unceasing attempts on their part to invade our
world no we would never let them dream of our
existence

  it was recognized though that with increasing scien-
tific ability the humans of earth might before long try
to devise space-shlps of their own

  if they did so they would duplicate our feat and
reach venus they would find our crowded venerian
cities on our little islands and would take news of them
back to earth

  we decided therefore that we must do all in our
power to prevent the earth-peoples from ever developing
a method of space-travel to do this we would have to
keep some venerians always on earth as spies or agents
acting for us

  since such spies must look as much as possible like
humans to pass when necessary as such on earth a group
of venerians were altered surgically to enhance a human
resemblance the tentacle-ends of their arms were


amazing stories

made into human hands and fingers the ends of their
leg-tentacles were made capable of wearing human shoes
their faces were somewhat remodelled to approach the
human artificial teeth placed in their mouths and altera-
tions of their vocal cords enabled them to produce the
sounds of human speech and wigs to simulate human
hair were provided and their green faces and hands were
whitened

  this group then headed for earth as passengers in
one of the space-ships we had built their first care was
to establish a base on earth where they would not be
discovered by humans and they did establish such a base
in the uninhabited stretches of what you call eastern
labrador there they built shelters for themselves and
the supplies they brought building also a landing-frame-
work for the greater safety of the space-ship then the
space-ship returned to venus leaving the venerian
spies in their base

  these venerians had several of the small fliers we
of venus use for transport between our various islands
in these they ventured out flying always by night and
explored earth they found parts of it still very savage
and other parts civilized they captured humans and
took them back to their base forcing them to teach them
the various earth-languages of course when they had
learned all they could from these captives they were
forced to kill them although we venerians abhor blood-
shed ordinarily still we could not let a few lives weigh
against the good of an entire race

  these venerian spies kept their watch over earth
they procured and read its journals and newspapers and
mai  sure that no attempts at space-travel were being
considered by humans

  in a few years venus and earth were again fairly
close to each other in space and across from venus to
thift world came a venerian space-ship with relief for
oux spies-other venerians who would take their place

  when these new arrivals had received sufficient in-
formation and training the others or the greater part
of them went back to venus in the ship and the new
arrivals continued the watch upon mankind

  and so it has been in all of the two hundred years
that have passed since then unsuspected by all of you
humans there has always been a group of venerians in
our base who disguised as humans were able to keep
posted on the progress of human science

  every few years they were replaced by others from
venus who volunteered for this duty

  in all this time until about twenty years ago there
was little work for our spies although he has pro-
gressed rapidly in scientific knowledge man has been
concentrating upon extending his power on earth without
thinking oi leaving it he has devised railroads and
steamships electrical power and radio and airplanes but
he has almost ignored the possibility of visiting other
planets

  but about a quarter of a century ago our spies
brought back to venus word that men were beginning
to speculate on the possibility of interplanetary travel
it was little more than speculation romancing but it
was significant of what might come so our spies on
earth were ordered to prevent at all costs any real de-
velopment in space-travel research

  the first case in which our venerian spies took action
occurred eight years ago until that time there was
only empty speculation about space travel and not much
of that but eight years ago our spies learned that willem

van hijnn a dutch engineer had become convinced that
a space-rocket could be designed which would reach
other planets and he was working on designs

  our venerian spies with their superior knowledge of
science knew van hijnns rocket-designs to be unwork-
able but nevertheless his researches on the subject could
not be allowed to proceed so not wanting ever to take
life save when there was no other course they visited
van hijnn in disguise and warned him to stop his work
he refused never dreaming of course of their true
identity

  so our spies were forced to kill van hijnn and to
destroy his work they did so quite simply by bringing
their flier over his laboratory by night and turning on
the building a stream of our chemical fire-fluid which
causes any non-metallic combustible substance it touches
to burst into flame van hijnn and his work were
destroyed

  in the same way the others were warned each one
refused to heed the warning they were all destroyed
morrow and krasney and the two japanese these
space-rocket experimenters perished in the next few years
in the same way as had van hijnn and for the same
reason

three years ago when the relief-ship came from

  a venus i came with it to earth to take my place
as head of the venerian spies here you seem to fhink
that it was i who was responsible for the killing of van
hijnn and those other earlier experimenters but that is
only because we venerians all look alike to you in this
disguise i was never on earth until three years ago

  in these three years i have done my part for venus
dr hayes the australian rocket-worker was the first
scientist i had to destroy then wilsoff and molokoff
then dr braun and mertaud and finally dr melford
and dr winn for the sake of my race my world i
have led in the destruction of these scientists who might
have brought nearer interplanetary travel for men it
is now almost time for the relief-ship to arrive and take
me and my companions back to venus but others will
arrive to take our place as long as we have spies on
earth no progress toward space-travel will ever be made
by men

  as peter nebos serious quiet voice stopped i stared
into the venerians calm green eyes with my brain
whirling

  during all this conversation the flier continued to
whirr on softly at tremendous speed northward through
the night the other venerians remained on watch at
controls and mechanisms but so fascinated had i been by
what i had heard that i was unconscious of my sur-
roundings

  one paramount question burst up from the chaos
of my thoughts

  but if you warned and then killed all those space-
rocket experimenters to prevent the furtherance of inter-
planetary travel why didnt you kill me  i asked why
did you carry me away

  those other scientists nebo explained were all
experimenting with space-rockets and fuels which while
they might in time bring about space-travel were far
inferior to our own design of space-ships we destroyed
them simply to prevent men from progressing in any
way toward space-travel as i have already said

  but you dr jackson in discovering a method of
producing unlimited atomic power have gone further
space-rocket murders



than our venerian scientists often have our scientists
tried to produce atomic power and failed when we
learned that you had solved the secret we had no desire
to kill you and destroy your work we wanted instead
to take this secret of yours to our scientists

 you mean that you carried me away because you
want to get my secret of atomic power from me i
cried peter nebo answered in the affirmative

  yes for by so doing we advance our own scientific
powers and space-travel possibilities immensely at the
same time we prevent your secret from ever becoming
known to humans

 i stared at him and then i began to laugh-raggedly
weakly hysterically nebo stared at me and the other
venetians in the speeding flier to gaze at me too

 the joke is on you in that case nebo i cried
there is no secret of atomic power-i never discovered
it at all

 that cannot be so dr jackson nebo said calmly
in the newspapers of the last few days there have been
long accounts of your discovery of atomic power and
your intention to use it in a space-traveling rocket

  but those accounts were lies i shouted they were
concocted deliberately by young melford and crail and
von gersten and me and published to draw you and your
band to me so that we could trap you

 nebos expression did not change i quite under-
stand why you should say so he told me naturally
you do not want this secret of atomic power to fall into
the hands of another race another world

  but im telling you the truth i said desperately
the whole thing was merely published to lay a trap
for you and your associates thats why my friends
were at hand when you appeared

 your friends would naturally be guarding you when
you had such a secret the venerian remarked i am
afraid there is no use pretending that you do not have
it

  i stared helplessly at him youll find out otherwise
when you try to get such a secret out of me i told him

  i will not try at all he answered i will leave that
to the scientists of venus

 a cold sweat seemed suddenly to break out on my
forehead of venus i repeated do you mean
youre going to take me   

 you will be taken to venus yes he said the
venerian relief-ship will arrive at our base in the next
two days and when it returns with us to venus you
go too

 once on venus our scientists can no doubt extract
from you information regarding your method of produc-
ing atomic power you will not be harmed unless you
make it necessary and though you will of course never
see earth again your experience may not be unpleasant
the prospect opened by his words was so appalling
that for a moment i was left speechless a random
thought struck me

 theyll know-my friends will know youre from
some other world when they find and examine the body
of the venerian shot in the laboratory i exclaimed

  no for two of my followers fired the laboratory as
we left nebo said that will destroy any formulas
as to your discovery that you may have left and will
also destroy the body of our companion

  i did not know could not know at that time that two
of crails men had managed to bring that fire under
control any more than the venerians suspected it i

felt caught in some nightmare from which presently
i surely must wake

  nebo left me and went to the nose of the flier again
i saw him conferring with the two venerians at its
controls no doubt on the course being followed

  i remained in a sort of dream as the flier whirred on
through the night the events that had snatched me
from my new york laboratory and presently would
transport me across a great gulf of space to another world
seemed incredible impossible

  looking now and again from the window i could see
only darkness beneath and from this absence of lights
i judged that the flier was already hurtling over the
sparsely-inhabited wastes of northern quebec toward
eastern labrador also the stars were paling eastward
to announce the imminence of dawn

  when the sickly gray light of day began to appear
in the east it dimly disclosed a barren treeless gray plain
far below over these steppes that were wholly without
sign of human beings the flier was moving at dizzying
speed

  but even as the day grew the flier was beginning to
slacken speed and to decrease its altitude i saw nebo
and the other venerians gazing from the windows ahead
and guessed that we were nearing their base

  there came into sight on the gray plain ahead what
looked like a small circle as the flier rushed on and
down toward it i saw that it was a circular embankment
of earth perhaps fifty feet high and a thousand in
diameter

  inside it was a row of neat metal buildings of no
great size except for three or four that looked like store-
houses

  this row of buildings was at one side of the circle and
at the other was a huge and curious structure it was
a metal framework built up from massive girders some-
thing like an amphitheatre or hollow hemisphere in shape
as though made to receive a huge ball it was at least two
hundred feet across

  the flier headed down toward the row of buildings
i saw two other fliers resting on the ground beside the
houses and a number of figures running out of the
buildings as we descended

  our craft slanted down hovered motionless a few
yards over the ground whirring softly then sank ver-
tically until it rested on the earth at once one of the
venerians threw open the door and a wave of cooler
air poured in

  nebo spoke to my two venerian guards and then to
me please go with us without making trouble dr
jackson it will be better for you if you do

here are you going to take me i asked
just to one of the buildings where we must
confine you until the relief-ship comes he said

  all right then i answered after a moments hesi-
tation

  i stepped out of the flier to the ground around me
besides nebo and my two guards crowded a score or
more of figures

  they were venerians like those i had already seen
disguised like nebo and the others by human-clothing
whitened hands and faces and the black wigs i could
not tell one from another-they looked so much the same

  nebo and the guards led me toward one of the smaller
metal buildings i noticed that the guards kept their
rods ready for use at all times


amazing stories

  the door was opened and i stepped into the little
building it was about twelve feet square and had no
windows-being used formerly as a minor store-room by
the venerians i supposed

  food will be brought you shortly dr jackson
nebo told me before the door was closed we have
no food such as you humans consume but i think you
can shift with ours

  when exactly do you expect your ship from venus
to come  i asked him

  it should be here day after tomorrow if all has been
well with it he said you will know as soon as it
arrives for always it stays just long enough to disembark
the venerians it brings and take on those returning
to venus it does not stay longer lest there should be
some chance discovery by humans of its coming

  but you cant really expect to take me back on it
i exclaimed not to another world when ive told you
that i have no process of producing the atomic power 

  the venerians strange face was expressionless i
have no choice in the matter he said i have my duty
to my race and my world

  with that he left me i inspected the interior of my
prison for some time in the hope that there might be
some method of escape from it but soon found there
was none

  within a half-hour the door opened and i was handed
a shallow metal platter of dark red mushy substance
and a metal bottle or flask of liquid which proved to be
pure water i ate a little of the mushy venerian food
but found a certain repellent fishy quality in its taste and
gave it up certainly i told myself if that were to be
my food in the future i would be poorly off

  when the food was handed in i saw two of the
venerians standing guard at the door with the fire-fluid
rods it was quite evident that nebo was taking no
chance of my escape before the ship from venus came

  and when it came-what then i asked myself a
voyage in it as a prisoner to another world a captivity
without hope of release in the island-cities of the watery
world of venus

  captivity-and maybe torture or death for it was
evident that nebo and the other venerians fully believed
my published statements and were convinced that i had
in my possession the knowledge of a method to produce
limitless atomic power

  once on venus their scientists would certainly en-
deavor by all means to wring that supposed secret from
me the murders of space-rocket experimenters which
they had systematically committed on earth to prevent
humans attaining interplanetary travel proved that they
would not balk at extreme measures to make me tell
them the secret

  i had no secret to tell them but they would never be-
lieve that they might use the most refined scientific
tortures to make me talk i cursed the inspiration of
captain crail that was responsible for my issuing those
statements crail and von gersten and artie melford
would they or anyone ever know what had happened to
me

  gradually i became aware that i was very tired and
stretching out on the floor of my prison i slept when
i awoke it was with a sensation of cold and through
the door-cracks i now saw that it was night outside i
had slept through twenty-four hours or more in my
weariness

  the next hours passed without incident i was

brought more of the food in the morning and this time
i ate more for i was extremely hungry i looked for
nebo to appear again but he did not with the food
this time though was brought a sleeping-rug

  i heard venerians pass outside now and then and once
the whirr of a flier that went and returned in a few
minutes i slept fitfully my dreams dominated by my
knowledge that the next twenty-four hours were to be
my last on earth if the relief-ship came as expected

  when i woke again and my food was brought nebo
came too eyeing me thoughtfully

  no we have seen no sign yet of the ship he said
in answer to my first question but it should be here
sometime soon

  when it does come and we take you to put you
aboard it with us i warn you not to make any struggle
or effort to escape

  it had been my resolve to make a last-minute attempt
to break free but i did not say so why not i asked

  because in that case we will have to use force
nebo answered we will take no chance of killing
you of course but rather than let you delay us we will
stun you you will avoid this unpleasant experience by
being reasonable

  i said nothing and he went out i heard him speak
to the venerians guarding my door as he closed it

  in indescribable tenseness i sat waiting for the in-
evitable moment hour after hour passed morning
gave way to noon and noon to afternoon by sunset
i began to wonder if the ship would come at all

  almost as i wondered i heard a throaty cry from one
of the venerians outside repeated instantly by a score
of them i sprang to my feet trembling i seemed to
hear a faint sound like distant steady throbbing

  i could hear the venerians running about outside my
prison suddenly the door was flung open and nebo
appeared four armed venerians with him

  the ship is arriving he told me hastily remember
my warning dr jackson come with us quietly

  i stepped out with them into the sunlight trembling
despite myself the sunset westward threw brilliant
light over the enclosure and the venerians were running
toward the great metal framework at its other side

  nebo pointed obliquely upward there high in the
light-streaming heavens hung a little ball of light drop-
ping rapidly on a steep slant toward the enclosure and
as i saw it i became aware of a faint throbbing sound
that was rapidly growing louder

  quick cried nebo we must be at the framework
when it lands

  with him and the venerian guards close about me
and the other venerians running nearby i was hustled
across the enclosure

  looking up as i stumbled on with my captors i saw
that the little light-ball was a metal sphere a huge globu-
lar craft gleaming in the sunsets light as it sank with
slackening speed toward the framework the throbbing
of it was now a loud and continuous thunder in our ears

it came lower more and more slowly a colossal
two-hundred foot metal ball sinking toward the
framework built to receive it i was half-way across the
enclosure now with nebo and the other venerians then
as a new sound smote my ears over the thunder of the
descending venerian ship i looked up

  i yelled and from nebo and the venerians came cries
of amazement and alarm the new sound i had heard
space-rocket murders



was a staccato roar and as it came to a crescendo i saw
an airplane speeding over the enclosure from the east
behind it were three more and behind those a half-dozen
others roaring at top speed toward the venerian ship
that even now was settling into the framework

 the planes dived and from them came the rattle of
their guns speaking over their motors roar pouring a
leaden hail down on the framework and ship in it i saw
venerians by the framework fall saw a door in the great
globular ships curving side swing open and venerians
emerge pointing up at the planes and shouting

 nebo forgot me for the moment cried orders rapidly
to the venerians at the buildings they ran to the four
torpedo-like fliers and in a moment these soared up
toward the planes

  the venerians holding me sought again to drag me to-
ward the framework and ship but now i was struggling
fighting with fists and feet

  and as i fought i saw the airplanes and the venerian
fliers above engaging in a wild dog-fight two of the
fliers crashed at the same moment against a plane and
all three fell

 from the remaining two fliers sprang jets of clear
liquid and in quick succession two planes burst into
flames and spun downward but there followed one of
the fliers and then the other as remaining planes poured
a storm of lead upon them and through their windows
and into them

 there was a chorus of yells from the edge of the
enclosure and on its eastern and southern embankments
appeared troops of men brown-uniformed soldiers with
rifles running down into the enclosure and firing at
the venerians and the framework holding the ship

  at this the venerians left in the enclosure ran toward
the framework i saw them swarming up a metal stair-
way toward the open door of the huge ship nebo and
my guards were dragging me despite my struggles toward
the mighty framework

 abruptly three of my guards dropped around me and
at the same moment i felt something like a hot iron sear
my shoulder i wrenched free from nebo and the other
guard and stumbled away from them as more rifle-bullets
hummed past us

 nebo and the venerian ran after me and then sud-
denly they too collapsed and lay still there was no
venerian left living in the enclosure save those clamber-
ing into the great ship and as i dropped to my knees
i saw the last of them hasten into it saw the great door
ponderously close and then with a sudden terrific throb-
bing thunder whose detonations almost split the ears
the huge ball rose into the air from the framework

  slowly majestically at first but faster and faster
the mighty sphere rose into the unset unheedful of the
comparatively tiny airplanes that dashed and stung about
it-rose until it was far overhead a dwindling light-
globe

 soldiers dashed past me toward the framework and
then arms caught and pulled me to my feet men in
civilian clothes were about me all crying out together

 lloyd shouted one of them and i came out of
my daze to recognize arthur melfords excited face and
then beside him was captain crail his features taut
and von gersten with blue eyes flaming with excitement

 lloyd we got here in time arthur was almost
weeping by heaven they were taking you to that
ship   

 to venus yes i said but how did you know that

you should come here how did you learn where their
base was

  the one i shot crail cried we found a metal
world-map in his pocket with lines drawn on it all radi-
ating from one point in eastern labrador and von
gersten   

  von gersten the german finished for him sees
that that point in eastern laborador can be but their
base where they come forth from on their trips over
earth we get the soldiers and the planes and hurry to
this point in time to save you though their ship gets
away it seems and you say to venus

  yes venus i exclaimed look can you see it
up there-can you see it yet

  high in the brilliant western sky the globular ship was
now but a little ball of light diminishing steadily as it
rose on a steep slant up and up it went smaller and
smaller it became in appearance and below it we could
see another speck of light but one that was sinking after
the sun the planet venus dropping from our sight

  then as we stared in awe von gersten and crail and
arthur and i close together we saw the receding light-
ball become a mere pinhead of luminescence a tiny shin-
ing point it seemed to waver for a moment in our
vision to hesitate then it was gone and we stood staring
after it into the empty sunset sky

chapter v

note by professor herman von gersten

there is nothing which i von gersten can add
to the known facts of that most astounding series
of killings which has come to be called the space-
rocket murders and its even more astounding sequel
and explanation the accounts drawn up by my com-
panions and friends of their various experiences in this
so-strange adventure summarize those facts completely

  yet if the facts need no addition from me it may yet
be that some comment would not be amiss so at least
have mr melford and captain crail and dr jackson
told me asking me to attach to their documents my opin-
ions as to the questions which must necessarily arise

  we men of earth have for the first time come into
direct contact with beings of another world who were
at least as intelligent as we are in the venerians view
of us as told to dr jackson by nebo we humans who
rule earth so unquestroningly for the first time see our-
selves as others see us and what we see is not pretty

  no we see that to beings with even a little more
civilization than ourselves such as the venerians the
races of men appear a fierce hostile and cruel species-
a species that utilizes its best intelligence and greatest
powers for the conducting of internecine war between
its own divisions an untrustworthy combative and mer-
ciless race to be feared and watched as the venerians
feared and watched us

  to us self-styled civilized races this view comes as
a shock is it justified we must ask ourselves were
the venerians wise to distrust us to such an extent as to
use any means to prevent us from ever reaching their
world or have the venerians been misled by surface
aspects and taken precautions which they might have
spared themselves

i think that any reflecting person who looks without
bias at our world and what we have made of it must
agree that the venerians showed wisdom in the course

wrath of
       the rurple

  by howard melvin fast

     t happens frequently that some marvelous discovery made by a brilliant scien-
     tist for the good of humanity proves fatal and catastrophic instead but that
     fact is not going to prevent brilliant and enterprising scientists from continuing
     their painstaking search for something new and startling how can any man
     foresee dire results from apparently innocent experiments

    the answer is here proved once more-he cant

  illustrated by morey

it is strange how changed the aspect of a thing
becomes when one looks at it in retrospect men
laugh at a war which devastated the earth a gen-
eration before and belittle a flood which brought
doom and destruction upon half a nation thus it
is not strange that the great catastrophe of  should
lose the place of prominence which it has occupied for
the past decade

  it is only wherrone flies above the wasteland above
 one of the fourteen states which the purple life devas-
 tated that the full immensity of the catastrophe is real-
 ized it is only then when one sees with his own eyes
 the stark mountains from which the forest has been
 stripped the scattered underbrush making futile efforts
 to cover the barren ground and the countless ruins that
 were once prosperous hamlets that a storm of wrath
 overtakes him and he  curses the perpetrator of this
 horror and he will curse as millions before him have
 cursed the name of doctor richard carter

  i do not write this as an apology for doctor carter
 nor as an eulogy his was a crime a crime against
 all humanity but he also saved a world from doom
 a doom which threatened to wipe from the face of the
 earth every living creature but one

  he is dead he has paid the supreme penalty at the
 hands of a wrathful mob try to think kindly of him
 to know him as i know him as a great scientist and a
 humane man as one of those many who gave their lives
 to humanity

  to his memory i dedicate this account of the happen-
 ings of the winter of 

  the purple life strange is it not that that thing
 which caused destruction unparalleled in history should
  be called life but it was life that i have always in-
 sisted although doctor carter thought differently he

 said-but let me tell it all from the night i received
 the message from doctor carter

  my acquaintance with doctor carter began at college
i was taking a pre-medical course he was an instructor
in biology one of the youngest of the staff he was my
senior by only a few years and we struck up a fast
friendship we worked together quite frequently his
specialty was cellular research i was interested in
bacteriology our branches of work were closely enough
related for us to be of assistance to each other then i
graduated and went to glasgow to complete my studies

  upon my return to america i set up a research lab-
oratory in new york here again my work brought
me into contact with doctor carter during the next
five years our friendship was renewed we collaborated
in several volumes upon cellular research then i re-
ceived an offer as a government bacteriologist which i
accepted my work took me to washington and kept
me there for seven years it was at the beginning of
my seventh winter there that the two events occurred
that changed the entire course of my life

  i was appointed head of the government bacteri-
ological staff and i received the following telegram from
doctor carter the punctuation is added

  come at once matter of utmost importance threat-
ens to involve entire nation cannot explain other than
to say i have blundered upon something which may
destroy civilization itself will be waiting at duplex
hotel come at once

  to say the telegram surprised me would be to put
it mildly it certainly served to stifle my elation at the
news of my appointment the message itself was as
unlike doctor carter as anything conceivable he was
essentially the scientist coldly calculating and not given
to emotional outburst only in a case of urgent neces-




amazing stories

sity would he send such a message he was not the
man to magnify a trouble if he said the matter was
one of national importance i could rest assured that it
was only one course lay open to me i wired that
i would leave for new york immediately

   as head of the bacteriological staff my time would be
much my own accordingly i gave notice to my subor-
dinates that i was leaving for new york upon official
business and that they could reach me at either the
duplex hotel or the home of doctor carter

   i had seen doctor carter only three months before
the difference between his former hearty self and the
man who met me in the magnificent lobby of the duplex
hotel was startling and almost unbelievable he had
aged twenty years in those three months his hair was
gray and his eyes dim and sunken his face was hag-
gard drawn as is the face of a man who has looked
upon death and found it terrifying

   he was obviously relieved at my presence and grasped
my hand as a drowning man would a straw

rank he cried you came my boy god if
you could only know what a relief it is to have
you here to have someone to talk openly to to confide
in frank you will never know what i have gone
through these past three weeks

   but you must be starved come well sup in the
roof garden later you can have my story

   a thousand and a half feet above new york in a
glass-topped conservatory we had our dinner the
city sprawled at our feet north south east west-as
far as eye could reach lay that pattern of blocks relieved
here and there by slim fingers of stone glass and metal
new york new york the living the pregnant the
imperishable never could i look at it without having
that same thrill of achievement of pride in all man has
accomplished and now it seemed more alive than ever
seemed to whisper to me and give me a message i could
not translate i turned to carter

   he was leaning forward regarding the city with the
strange fascination of one who looks at tragedy grim
stark tragedy then he shook himself and looked about
him as if he were coming out of a stupor

   frank look at it his voice was low it was like
the voice of a man who speaks of death in a few
weeks it will be gone all gone crushed destroyed by
that which i have created for gods sake frank help
me i need it

   i was convinced somehow that he spoke the truth
and pressed him for an explanation but it was not until
we were in his car driving toward his home that he
gave me the story

   you know no doubt he began why i changed my
residence from new york to a mountainside in ulster
county my work involved certain dissection and vivi-
section it was work which i could not perform in a
crowded community thus i established my laboratory
in one of the few remaining isolated sections within
convenient driving distance of new york

   there for the past three years i have been engaged
upon cellular research in a seemingly futile quest for
the secret of life my ultimate object has been the
restoration of organs of the human body

   in the beginning i confined myself to the grafting
of limbs upon animals then a new thought occurred
to me i would search for the secret of life itself would
discover the basic organization of protoplasm once the

idea had taken hold it became an obsession with me
life i reasoned had been originally created either by
accident or by design what had been done once might
be done again

  you have heard of the theory of spontaneous
generation 

  yes i replied a theory long discarded

  true it has been discarded but it has never been
entirely disproved

  but surely i said you do not in this age of exact
science accept spontaneous generation

  why not that in all probability was the manner
in which life came into being and how do you account
for new diseases new bacteria new protozoa no
not only do i believe in spontaneous generation but i
have seen it occur

  you have seen it occur his awful earnestness
held me

  yes i have seen certain elements combined in cor-
rect quantities under given conditions assume that which
we speak of as life

  my senses whirled you have overworked old man
you need a rest but i believed him in spite of my-
self i tried to tell myself that he was mad when i
knew him to be sane mercilessly sane

  no he said would to god that i were mad but
i am not unless you mean the madness of fear of
worry

  then you have done what man has dreamed of doing
throughout the ages-you have created life

  either life or something that resembles life more
than anything man has heretofore produced

  why man i cried do you realize what this will
mean to humanity

 yes he said slowly it will mean death ruin de-
struction and ultimate doom

  he spoke no more but gave his attention to the road
knowing doctor carter i did not press him for further
explanation but turned over in my mind what he had
just told me undoubtedly he was preparing me for
what was to come

  we were well out of new york now and swirling
along the new west shore speed highway a slight
fall of snow had covered the ground and the road a
bright white ribbon in the moonlight stretched away
before us

  it was almost midnight when he put his car up the
last stretch of road a rough lumber track which wound
its way up a seemingly impassable mountainside it was
bitterly cold and the snow upon the road made the go-
ing doubly difficult

  with a sigh of relief i sank into a commodious chair
and stretched my feet toward the doctors blazing fire
after steaming tea had further fortified us against the
bitterness of the night we took our pipes to the library
and the doctor continued his story

  frank he said looking at me through the blue
smoke that curled about his face and hair did you
ever realize how greatly our imaginations are limited
by what we know or have seen what has man ever
done that is truly creative what has he ever con-
ceived that is not a repetition of that which has existed
before true he has introduced variety but is he ca-
pable of imagining that which is a true departure from
anything heretofore known i do not think so

  we know only one form of life that which has the
cell as a basis knowing only that form we can con-
wrath of the purple



ceive of no other frank can you picture life with no
cellular structure life that has no form life that is not
protoplasm life that is life in name only can you
picture elements energized so that they can absorb
nourishment from the earth or the air and yet having
no discernible means of doing so can you picture
such a thing doubling its size every three or four days
and disintegrating all organic matter which it comes
into contact with can you picture that thing let loose
upon a peaceful countryside increasing its bulk at an
unthought of rate destroying like some grim reaper
all in its path calculate its rate of increase and you
will know what i know that if that thing is not de-
stroyed within thirty days not only america but the
entire world is doomed

this was too much for a finite mind to quickly
grasp either the man was mad-but no his face
gave no lie to his sanity he spoke the truth

  but come i said take the funereal expression off
your face if such a thing exists it is not invulnerable
we must act quickly and destroy it while it is yet small
enough to control

  small enough to control he shook his head wear-
ily slowly he got to his feet and passed a worn hand
across his brow motioning for me to follow he led 
the way through the house to one of the rear rooms
here he threw open a window unlocked the storm
shutters and pointed up the hillside

  there he said does that look small enough to
control

  i drew back in surprise from a point about two
hundred yards above us to another point three hundred
yards further up the mountain side was dull purple
the silver rays of the full moon lit its surface with an
unearthly radiance almost it seemed alive like some
great omnipotent monster lying in wait for its prey in
shape it was roughly circular its height as nearly as i
could judge was over thirty feet its strangest feature
was the illusion of transparency it gave an observer i
imagined that i could see into it deep into its violet core
and discern dull purple fires i did not need the words
of doctor carter to assure me that it was alive potent

  carter pointed to the center of the purple mass
that was my laboratory

  silently we returned to the library i had a strange
reluctance to speak to discuss that thing upon the hill-
side a feeling of lethargy of futility had overtaken
me wearily i sank into a chair the doctor stood
before the hearth his drawn features outlined in the
crimson glow of the flames

  we have three days here-in this house then it
will be gone his voice was tired

  i said nothing i was thinking or rather trying to
force my harassed brain to function now looking
back i wonder that i did not suggest some plan of
action some method of attack perhaps it was due to
the feeling of helplessness of despair which the purple
exerts upon all who see it for the first time or perhaps
it was because i suddenly realized the vast responsibility
which would rest upon me as head of the government
bacteriological staff

  the doctor was speaking again my assistant slept
in the laboratory i left him there-with the purple
in the morning he was dead-in the purple his
body-

  his face was working straining as he lived over that

fatal morning when we saw the first of its victims

  since then i have attempted to destroy it i tried
everything-gas heat bacteria dynamite acid-all to
no avail once intense heat might have killed it now
it is too late it thrives upon cold acid makes almost
no impression upon it you could explode a thousand
tons of dynamite in it and every minute fragment would
live and grow i have injected it with bacteria with
every obtainable species yet they have less effect than
they would have upon the earth itself i have attempted
to grow molds and fungus upon it all was futile
it destroys all that is organic acts as a powerful
corrosive

  he held out his hands the fingers were covered
with the scars of recently healed sores

  this he said is the result of a first contact then
he stood at the hearth silently while i gazed moodily
into the fire when he spoke again it was not to me
but to the swirling flames you will have to inform
the authorities

  yes i answered that will be my duty

  he sighed and his bowed shoulders slumped just a
bit more i put it off as long as i could i wanted
you to know first to see for yourself and then it is
doubtful as to how the populace will react

  you can reassure yourself upon that score i said
it will be kept from the public as long as possible
and how long do you think that will be once it
begins to cover farms and cities

  that will not be for some time

  doctor carter shook his head you do not realize
the speed with which that thing increases itself in a
few days it will cover this house a week or two more
and the entire valley will be inundated in another
month new york then the north atlantic seaboard
then count the days before north america becomes a
sacrifice to this thing i have created

  but now away from the brooding significance of the
purple i was recovering my assurance i cleared my
throat and spoke more buoyantly than i had since i re-
ceived doctor carters telegram something there is
that will stop it something that will destroy it as re-
morselessly as it destroys all in its path tomorrow we
will leave for washington the entire resources of the
government will be placed at your disposal my staff
will be constantly at your command surely before the
week is up you will have discovered something some-
thing with which to fight and destroy this menace
the next morning i had my first intimate view of the
purple it had increased appreciably since last night
and now as i stood before it i could feel it swell and
grow its smooth gelatinous surface suggested iron-
ically enough grape jelly i had an insane desire to
taste some of it to plunge my hand into it and press it
to my mouth

  doctor carter turned to me a curious smile upon his
face he had changed visibly since the night had
thrown off the mantle of gloom which hung about him
and now he seemed a different man he was as one
who has been given a challenge and braces himself to
meet it

  looks pretty harmless doesnt it  he held a walk-
ing stick in his hand and now he plunged it into the
jelly-like mass for a moment nothing happened then
the wood seemed to wilt and crumble away only then
when i saw that polished hardwood melt like butter did
i realize what we were facing


amazing stories

octor carter salvaged the remains of his
stick and cast it away that is what happened
to johnsons body that is what became of my labora-
tory and that will be its effect upon every organic
obstacle that bars its path you see then that we are
facing ultimate destruction

  i had phoned for the county sheriff and when we
returned to the house he was waiting for us i ex-
plained to him the situation and the developments we
expected from his attitude i could see that he thought
we were either mad or the engineers of a huge hoax
it was only after i had shown him my credentials and
had given him a first hand exhibition of the action of
the purple that the twin lights of fear and belief ap-
peared in his eyes

  i explained explicitly the developments that were ex-
pected in the three days i would be gone and how to
meet them

  he was to communicate with the state police and
have the district within a radius of two miles put under
martial law he was to order complete evacuation of
the district and under no circumstance was he to give
any information to the public or the press i assured
him that i would return in three days or less and that
until then no measures other than those i had given
him were to be taken against the purple and lastly
i warned him against the deadliness of the menace its
stroke was quicker and more decisive than the sting
of a rattler it killed with more certainty than the
deadliest infernal machine and the death it dealt was
crueler than any man had known no living thing must
touch its deadly surface the growing fear in his little
eyes assured me that the precautions would be well
taken   

  it was high noon when doctor carter and i stepped
off the plane at washington we went first to the
offices of the secretary of the interior and laid the en-
tire story before him only after several hours discus-
sion did we convince him of its truthfulness the sam-
ples of the purple which we had brought from new
york were the final factor in obtaining his belief he
was won over and asked us to present any plans which
we had for the solution of the problem

  one of the strange features of those first few days
was that no one of us connected with the battle against
the purple excepting perhaps doctor carter realized
the full imminence of this new menace it was signifi-
cant that the secretary did not at that time reproach
doctor carter we must he said make great sac-
rifices in the name of science and he was one of the
men who later suggested hanging doctor carter as the
perpetrator of one of the most terrible and destructive
crimes against humanity this to show what panic will
do to the most staid of mankind

  firstly i asked that all chemical and biological re-
sources of the country be placed at the disposal of
doctor carter and secondly that temporarily at least
i should be placed in charge of all measures taken
against the purple

  the secretary assured me that this could be done at
least for the time and then asked what steps i pro-
posed to take

  i desire i told him to test the effects of gas
electricity and rays upon the purple failing in that
i will attempt wholesale destruction by chemical flames

  i also want you to use your influence to have the
army and the navy placed at my disposal and to grant

me absolute authority within the area defined by a radius
of five hundred miles from ulster county

  the secretary and doctor carter gasped in astonish-
ment what i was asking for was virtual dictatorship
over the center of the countrys industrial and commer-
cial section

  the secretary shook his head i am afraid he
said that what you ask cannot be granted nor does
the situation seem to warrant such drastic action it
would be more customary in such a predicament as this
to place the authority in the hands of the army or the
local authorities

  inwardly i cursed his narrow-mindedness

  cant you see cried doctor carter that this is not
an ordinary occasion that this is an emergency unlike
anything heretofore encountered by man we must
work quickly in speed lies our only salvation our only
hope we cannot wait for the official machinery to
function both the army and the local authorities will
be slow entangled in the conventional red tape as they
are if unchecked even for weeks the destruction
wrought by this thing will make the great war harmless
by comparison the fate of our nation the united
states of america hangs in the balance this is not a
matter of politics of territory of state or city rights
it is a crisis in the existence of humanity itself

  and what asked the secretary makes you believe
that your colleague is the man for the dictatorship
doctor carter leaned forward sir he said with
grim earnestness forget for once about your army
your navy your police about all means of force science
has created this thing and only science can destroy it
he pointed to me he is a man of science the calm
assurance of his words seemed to quell the secretarys
last doubts he was won over

  the secretary was to return to new york with me
doctor carter remained at my washington laboratories
he was convinced that all my efforts would be futile
before i left he had a few words with me alone

  frank he said once i thought i created life now
i know differently we call it life because we can con-
ceive no other name for it but it is not life nor is it
lifeless perhaps there has been a certain change within
the very atoms themselves perhaps we have chanced
upon something so different that we cannot venture a
thought as to its identity the human mind is vey
finite this thing is too big for me it leaves me be-
wildered and terrified

  but frank i have the formula and i have the
method what i once did i can do again there must
be a reagent which will destroy this thing from a
strange world i drew the purple and from the same
world i will draw its doom

  i clutched at his arm for gods sake doctor leave
that formula alone burn it destroy it but dont chance
letting loose another menace such as this upon the
world

  frank he retorted unless the purple is destroyed
there will be no world of man to let loose another
menace upon no frank we must fight this thing with
a weapon yet unknown to man it is our only hope

the next afternoon the secretary and i left for
new york his special plane touched the waters
of the upper bay in less than an hour

  immediately after landing we directed our steps to-
ward the city hall and were closeted for several hours
wrath of the purple



with the mayor he was already cognizant of the situa-
tion having received daily reports from the up-state
officials it seemed that the thing had increased at an
unbelievable rate far beyond anything which the doctor
or i had expected we explained to the mayor what
developments might be expected and asked him to be
prepared to take measures to evacuate the city the
secretary then asked that all resources of the city be
placed at my disposal at a time like this state and
city rights must be submerged to a common good

 we were leaving the city hall when the first blow
feh the voice of a news boy was bawling through the
street wuxtry read all about the purple menace 
wuxtry i bought a copy and stared in bewilderment
at the heavy black type

 country doomed by purple menace it read and
beneath that sprawled over the face of the page was
the entire story of the purple life and the papers
had spared no efforts to make it sensational maps cov-
ered with circles to show the advance of the purple
first hand pictures of the purple itself pictures of the
land before and after the purple had wrought its wrath
yes those papers certainly saw their point and played
to it forty days existence were given to the united
states

 the secretary tore the paper from my hands and
turned blue as he read it someone will pay for this
he roared ill break their damned sheet

 i shrugged my shoulders after all this was to be
expected according to the papers the thing was over
two miles in diameter nothing of that size could be
kept from the public and perhaps it was best that the
populace should be warned when the thing was yet com-
paratively small it might avoid later panics

 we planned our campaign the secretary would re-
turn to washington he would have to confer with the
president as to the mobilization of the nations forces
he left me with full authority to undertake those mea-
sures which i had suggested and even went to the trouble
of chartering a plane for my own use

 blase new york took the matter calmly people dis-
cussed it at their dinner tables and it became a subject
for intellectual controversy but they held little doubt as
to the ability of the authorities to control it

  i made provision for the transportation of the chem-
icals and the gas and then took a taxi to curtis field
there i obtained the planes needed in the work and
provided for the establishment of a base in the vicinity
of the purple

  then i flew to the scene of action the fact that the
place was under martial law did not serve to dispel the
crowds of the curious one of the small country towns
had already been partly buried by the gelatinous mass
the state police were attempting to clear the streets
and the houses of angry citizens one old lady pro-
tested that she had lived in that village for sixty years
and was not prepared to move before a pile of grape
jelly that little incident cast a shadow of coming
troubles would millions of people part with their most
cherished possessions willingly would they be pas-
sive or would we witness mob revolt unprecedented in
history i wondered

  one glance at that quivering violet pile convinced me
of the futility of my efforts a solid wall of purple
perhaps a hundred feet in height stretched away upon
either side its movement was clearly perceptible now
and like some grim monster it came on destroying all

before it i thought of that glacier which was some day
to cover the earth with a blanket of unending ice rue-
fully i reflected that the story was not far from consum-
mation only this time it was not ice

troops were arriving in a steady stream and i
could hear the low hum of planes several loud
detonations came from the purple and making out a
squadron of bombers i remembered doctor carters
words you could explode a thousand pounds of dyna-
mite in it and every minute fragment would live and
grow

  futile i thought all is futile no efforts of man can
destroy that bulk

  when the chemicals and gas came i proceeded with
my experiments the pitiful insignificance of my ma-
terials chilled my heart it was all so useless so terribly
futile as i expected the purple remained unaffected
tear gas mustard gas chlorine hydrogen helium-all
were tried and all failed on the morrow i would pro-
ceed with my plan of chemical combustion the secre-
tary had pulled the wires well thousands of tons of
combustibles were arriving hourly but no hope rose in
my breast the purple was too great too powerful
the chill about my heart increased

  before dark i took an observation flight over the
purple one speaks easily of three or four miles but
it was not until i had seen the purple from above had
seen that livid blot upon the peaceful landscape that i
realized how very much land could be included in a
circle of that diameter

  in the dark of the night i was awakened by a trooper
the purple had increased at a rate beyond that which
we had expected it was at our very bedsides i slept
no more that night

  in the gray of the dawn we commenced operations
plane after plane circled above the purple and dropped
continually a living stream of fire soon the face of the
purple had become a leaping mass of flames for two
hours operations continued and then the supply of
chemicals was exhausted

  it was a last crushing blow to look upon that unruffled
purple surface if the flames had done any harm it
was too insignificant to be noticed life then seemed
very very hopeless

  the next days were reminiscent of the retreat of some
defeated army step by step we gave ground to the
purple to what purpose the government massed their
troops about the purple i do not know it is strange
that in times of stress mans first thoughts are of force
but the troops only sat by their guns although now and
again they moved in orderly retreat

  water was a last futile hope would- the advancing
purple tide cross the hudson river anxiously we
waited and then we saw-saw our last hope dashed to
pieces the purple overtook the stream and like a
monster animal rolling its bulk in some tiny water hole
dispersed it

  then the nation awoke to the crisis not yet with
panic but with the grim seriousness of a country going
into war and like a nation going into war they mob-
ilized their forces of relief and oppoation then i was
proud of my country

  i need not weary you with a detailed account of that
which you know so well the advance of the purple
through new york state sufficient to say that i aged
a lifetime in the next week in my dreams i live over


amazing stories

those days and often i wake cold and wet to see again
those proud cities smothered beneath the mass of the
purple arrogant in its omnipotent wrath it crept down
the hudson river overwhelming and destroying one
by one the cities that had arisen upon her banks pough-
keepsie newburgh tarrytown irvington yonkers
each in turn surrendered to the unhalting mass

  i was in new york when the great exodus began
new york was being abandoned new york the great
file jewel of america the most magnificent metropolis
of a world was spread upon the altar a sacrifice to the
purple

  from the tower of the old empire state building we
watched the advance of the purple it seemed that
notwithstanding the efforts of the police to clear the
city the greater part of the populace had delayed their
departure until the last moment now like crawling
streams of ants the cars and people poured over the
bridges that were the outlets of manhattan now one
of the lines threw itself into a tangle woman screamed
whistles shrilled automobile horns sounded and the cars
and people piled up in an ever increasing mass the
streets were black with people for blocks around with
a shrieking groaning fear-ridden mob later we
learned that almost a thousand lives had been snuffed
out in that mad scramble to leave the doomed city the
bridges and streets were still choked with frightened hu-
manity when the first of the purple came into sight

  slowly majestically like some deliberate stream of
water the purple poured over the city reluctantly as
though loath to part with what had so long been its
heritage the city gave over its countless dwellings to the
irresistible tide first to yield was the residential sec-
tions of bronx and manhattan easily the purple made
its conquest there more stubborn were the skyscrapers
of midtown even after the purple had passed them
they held themselves aloft cried that they would not
bow that they were new york the eternal silently we
watched it until the purple was beneath our very feet
the city was dead now cleared of all humanity except
a few observers who retreated before the purple we
were the last to leave that silent place step by step we
gave ground to that rolling tide

  hours later my plane circled over new york it was
a vast tombstone a city that was dead where streets
and houses had been where traffic had roared and mil-
lions of people slept only the purple tide eddied now
and then a faint crash would mark the yielding of an-
other proud skyscraper to the weight of the purple a
noble city had died

  all america unselfishly joined in the relief work
millions were homeless the task of feeding and hous-
ing them was one to stagger the stoutest of nations
and added to those were the millions daily made home-
less by the advance of the purple connecticut rhode
island massachusetts vermont new hampshire new
jersey pennsylvania one and all they felt the relent-
less grip of the purple life

the world was first awakening to the imminence of
the new menace and it was with the wild fearful-
ness of the cornered hart who sees the hunters approach-
ing but is kept at bay by the dogs a wave of panic
swept the world there was talk of an exodus to mars
or venus in the new rocket ships others suggested
digging vast caverns into which the people would retreat
after the purple had conquered the world fanatical

preachers screamed of the judgment day while gray-
haired scientists shook their heads in despair a world-
wide panic which dwarfed into insignificance the de-
pression of ninety thirty-two gripped the financial world

  then began the great american emigration one
thought superseded all others that america was doomed
thousands fled to europe until the european nations
threw up immigration barriers and forbade further
refuge upon their shores then they turned to canada
at first refuge was not denied then when the cana-
dians saw the purple approach their border they forbade
immigration troops were thrown along the border and
in places pitched battles were fought there would have
been war then were not war so futile in the face of
that greater menace the purple in mexico the situa-
tion was different at first mexican troops were thrown
along the border then the southwesterners grew des-
perate they stormed the border and in parts broke
through although those that did were wiped out as
soon as they were in mexico proper the world from
an orderly group of nations became an uncalculating
mob rioting grew in all countries two thousand
years of civilization were forgotten pandemonium
reigned

  and then a voice above the others cried out against
the perpetrator of this crime and the cry was taken
up by the masses until the name of doctor carter was
cursed in every country upon the face of the earth a
second judas they called him-a man who had not only
betrayed his master but humanity itself

  and then i received a message from doctor carter-
the first since we parted at washington am on the
track it read come quickly if possible i left at
once anything was better than to watch the purple in
its remorseless advance

  when washington fell beneath the purple the gov-
ernment moved to columbus ohio there in the build-
ing that had been set aside for our use i met doctor
carter he had changed changed in more ways than
one his hair was white and his face was thin to ema-
ciation but the difference lay in his eyes they were
bright shining as are the eyes of a man who has been
snatched from the jaws of death and in them was
hope such as i had not seen in the eyes of any man
for days

  frank he said these past days have gone badly
with you you have worked hard too hard it was
typical of doctor carter that at a time when he was
prepared to disclose a secret that gave life to man he
should inquire as to my health he was ever thus
thinking little of himself and much of others

  there will be no rest i answered gloomily until
the purple is gone or the earth becomes a place of dead
memories

  doctor carter was smiling now the first smile i had
seen for many long days and it will be gone frank
as soon as we can manufacture enough rays to
destroy it

  ray rays i shook my head destroy it again
i shook my head something in the scheme of things
was wrong radically wrong i should not be here lis-
tening to wild speculation i should not be gathering
hope i should be back there back with the purple
fighting it building futile barriers lighting pitiful fires
fighting always fighting i should not be here i should
not hope there was no hope no hope only the purple
the purple suddenly the room flashed with a thou-
wrath of the purple



sand fires purple flames darted about and above me
all was purple i purple everywhere then the doctor
was bending above me

half laughing half crying he led me into his study
he gave me a drink and it served to bring me to my
senses things began to right themselves and the purple
flames died away he shook hib head reassuringly just
a simple reaction he said the news was too much and
too good after the terrific mental tension i sighed and
dropped back in the chair

then suddenly i sat up and looked at him you
werent fooling me you werent jesting tell me you
werent jesting

he shook his head i was not he said slowly then
he walked to the center of the room and laid his hand
upon a small replica of one of those great power-lights
they use on landing fields this he said is our
salvation

but what-

again he shook his head i cannot explain i hardly
understand it myself you remember that it wa with
a ray that i brought about the change in matter that
created the purple that ray did something to the atoms
changed some part of their inner structures i have
been experimenting with that same ray attempting to
create life again attempting to find something that would
destroy the purple then i thought of varying the
wave length of the ray and chanced upon this he
pointed to the thing in the center of the room

but what is it i exclaimed what use is it

he made no answer but turned to a large cabinet
he swung open the door and i started back in surprise
there was the purple throbbing and glowing in all its
malignancy he swung the ray projector about until
its lens faced the cabinet then he touched a button
upon its surface there was a blue flash a rush of air
and where the purple was showed only the metal sides
of the cabinet holes gaped from its rear panel and
the wall behind it was similarly scarred

the doctor turned to me and smiled for i was still
gazing at the spot where the purple had been it is
very dangerous he said had i left it on for another
moment the house would be down upon our heads

i was speechless i could only gasp what is it
what is it

the doctor turned to the projector a practical
disintegration ray  

it is said that we are possessed of a certain sixth
sense an intuition perhaps it was this that made the
doctor so carefully instruct me in the manufacture and
use of the ray he warned me not to delay but to
strike at once time was precious each hour thou-
sands of people were being made homeless the whole
country must turn to the manufacture of the ray pro-
jectors hurry he urged me time is precious

and then from without there came a murmur like
the rising power of the surf it rose and swelled a
rattle of stones sounded against the broad windows the
doctor and i stepped towards them a huge mob of
homeless men and women had gathered in the court
and now they surged back and forth calling out doctor
carters name

the doctor turned to me a strange smile upon his

face i will tell them he cried we are sure of suc-
cess  let them be happy too and before i could move
to stop him he stepped out upon the tiny stone balcony

  he raised his arms for silence there was something
dynamic in his presence something which quieted the
mob as oil quiets troubled waters then he began to
speak

  his voice was powerful musical with suppressed glad-
ness slowly he spoke begging them to forgive him to
forgive him for what he had done and now had the
power to undo then from somewhere in the mob
there was a shot doctor carter crumpled back into
the room hands clenched at his breast the mob caught
with sudden fear melted away

  i knelt beside him and lifted his head he murmured
a few words about the ray projector and died i knelt
there warm tears rolling down my cheeks

  the next day the nation from depths of despair was
lifted to heights of wildest exultation they had a
martyr and they had a cure life again was good but
i could think only of my friend lying before that win-
dow dead

  what need to tell more what need to tell of those
next days days through which i moved as does one who
is in the grip of a nightmare and always with the face
of that white-haired scientist before me but they are
part of this chronicle and happy days they were hap-
piness that to me was mixed with grief grief over him
who was my friend

  as an individual the nation turned to the manufac-
ture of the ray projectors every available factory ran
day and night the projectors poured forth in an un-
ending stream day and night the blue flames crackled
day and night men fought the purple foot by foot it
gave ground more projectors came forth more blue
flames darted against the purple and more ground came
from beneath its grasp it was a hard fight but not a
losing one each new bit of ground that emerged gave
the fighters further hope then twenty-one days after
the day on which i first saw the purple the last of that
dread menace disappeared into nothingness the world
took a deep breath and sighed   

  there are those who say that good came of the purple
life perhaps that is so perhaps nothing god ordains
is without good yet-

  the old order changeth giving place to the new

  the purple life devastated fourteen states and a
good portion of canada destroying the very flower of
north american civilization the mighty new york
of the past the rich cities of pennsylvania and massa-
chusetts and the great ports of the north atlantic sea-
board are gone

  but in their place has risen a new civilization a new
new york mightier than its predecessor a new and
better east an east that man has long dreamed of a
harried nation is righting itself after a great crisis

  they honor me for what i have done in halting that
devastating tide but the praise hurts

  for upon a little hillside in ulster county is a stone
it is a rough stone unpolished and hard and often as
i stand there looking up the bleak mountainside i think
of him who lies beneath it and then the words graven
upon its face mean more than the praise of a nation

  it reads thus

to the memory of doctor richard carter the savior of a nation may he rest in peace

      ttfhen you stop to think about it perspective is exceedingly important
      rr in the consideration of the rightness of any decision with a change of
      perspective or point of view as it were conditions must necessarily appear in
      an altogether different light just so is it true in the matter of size the reac-
      tions of some foreign element-human or otherwise to certain aspects of our
      environment-have been written about before but our well-known author gives
      us something entirely different in this very clever story

illustrated by morey

there was no reminder of the medieval
alchemist with his dust-laden tomes his
belching forge his stuffed crocodile and
empty skulls in the bright pleasant chamber
that housed professor duncan trents lab-
oratory it was a converted conservatory in the old
home he maintained as his residence and workshop
three sides were of glass the roof a skylight pouring
sunlight down upon the healthy flowering plants set in
boxes in a ring around the floor under the windows or
on stands even when the sun was not shining it was a
pleasant room only the low tables with their clear
glass receptacles of every size and shape the chest of
shelves along the back wall with its rows of bottles
tagged with strange scientific names and an occasional
strange pungent odor told one that this was a room
devoted to science

  it was the duty of mike turey to keep his laboratory
neat and clean each day he swabbed the red and blue
tile floor with sudsy water ran his duster over tables
and machines and washed out the glasses the professor
ordered to be ready for his ministrations then care-
fully he watered the potted plants brought in cut-
flowers from the garden to set in the many vases and
bowls about weeded and trimmed the flower boxes
mike was also the some-time assistant to the professor
helping the scientist when a second hand was needed at
some delicate task a crippled war veteran he had
found congenial surroundings in the professors pleas-

ant employ for himself and his wife trent liked him
and often discussed his latest discoveries or failures with
the ex-service man

  today everything was finished in the laboratory ex-
cept for the watering of the plants mike was a little
late with the watering because he had taken time out
to wash the flower vases and bowls now he came
stumping into the laboratory weighted down with his
watering cans his limp just barely noticeable it was
a darkish cloudy day in april and on such days his
leg ached a bit more than usual

  mary a crash the gurgling splash of water on
the tiles as the watering cans dropped from nerveless
hands and mike the efficient stood rooted to the ground
just within the french window of the laboratory star-
ing agape at his wife settled in one of his masters
chintz-covered chairs hands folded in her lap her head
and body bathed in the golden glow of a light from a
lamp over her head

  that the lamp was not an ordinary one was evident
at first glance its shade was a bowl-shaped affair of
shiny metal on a tall stand and the golden light issuing
from it seemed to have a malevolent gleam in its depths
it cut the grayness of the room like a knfe

  mary mikes second cry was a shriek for it is
not given every man to see his plump wife shrinking
into a child again which was exactly what was happen-
ing from a big-bosomed comfortable sort of a woman
of five feet four inches tall she had already shrunk to

all his might he brought the stick
downward in a great circle toward
the beasts glistening eyes   


amazing stories

a woman four feet five inches when her husband first
caught sight of her and from his first to second cry she
had shrunk even more nor did she stir at his calls and
mike saw her eyes were closed her breathing spas-
modic

  his second cry aroused mike from the apathy of his
first fright and the next instant he was a hurtling body
that crossed the intervening space between himself and
his wife in an astounding shortness of time but the
lamp-cord was his undoing it caught his bad foot and
sent him crashing forward the momentum of his body
overturning his wifes chair and the lamp in one blow
cracking his head upon the tile floor with such force
that he lost consciousness for several minutes

  the cataclysm that had carried the lamp and chair to
the floor with mike had acted as a catapult upon the
womans diminishing form flinging her across the near-
est flower box and there she hung her head upon the
boxs edge her feet dropping over the side only as
she continued to shrink in size it could be seen that the
box would soon be large enough to contain all of her
and the spreading fan of the golden ray from the lamp
still shone upon her as it now shone upon the prone
body of her husband huddled close to the flower box

some minutes later mike raised his aching head but
that was not the only part of him that ached every
bone every muscle ached as if he had indulged in some
new sort of bodily exercise that brought every muscle
in his body into play more than he knew he possessed
a groan pushed its way up his throat then another he
found he enjoyed groaning for several minutes he
practiced this until he found the groans cost him un-
necessary effort and he desisted instead he tried sitting
up and was surprised to find he could do it but what
strange place was this

  all around him for what seemed miles was a red
plain a deep red a plain that might have been called
flat though of exceeding roughness he could not call
them hills they were more like rough pits crater pits
such as he had known in the war only his mind was
too stunned now to associate such ideas he could only
think of his immediate present and try to place it in his
memory the plain seemed to have a glossy finish at
one time but now it was dulled roughened only the
high points of the craters retained a reminiscent polish
from the past a sort of diffused gray light hung over
him and by placing a hand above his eyes and squinting
he could see strange undefinable shapes in the far
distances

  but what was this out of the heavens was falling
a strange rain he called it rain for want of a better
word but he could not remember such a rain as this
for from all sides was a continuous falling of strange
particles boulders of every size and shape from the
size of a baseball to several times the size of his head-
sticks long and short of every color every hue drop-
ping around him on all sides obscuring the landscape
partly making it necessary to dodge their blows he
could hear them falling to the ground click crash boom
one hit his shoulder another fell across his extended
kgs luckily they were not heavy and did not hurt him
but he knew the large boulder coming down through the
air toward him would hurt unless he dodged it he
tolled to one side under it and got to his feet the
mass plopped into the spot where he had been sitting
lightly as if gravity did not matter much here he

looked at it carefully it was cube-shaped and had the
appearance of iron it was smooth to his touch and cold

  the air cleared a moment of the falling debris and he
gazed around him far to his right was the dark line
of a crevice in the plain grayish in color a ravine of
shallow depth on its opposite side lay a second plain
blue in color a dull grayish blue looking to the left
he could discern a second ravine more distant than the
one on his right and beyond it lay a second plain of
blue before him the red plain was wide and he could
just make out the crack that enclosed it but turning
on his heel he saw that less than forty yards from
where he stood was a fourth crevice and a fourth blue
plain it seemed the most natural thing in the world to
him that he should be standing on a red plain cut by
four straight dikes with blue plains on their other sides
he tried to recall where he had seen that pattern before
but so strange seemed his awakening he could not quite
recall the past beyond the point of his awakening here
on the red plain it was an effort to try to think he
could feel a bump on the side of his head and he
attributed his loss of memory to it

  with the idea of orientating himself still further he
studied the landscape beyond the four coulees all the
blue plains seemed identical as far as he could see but
for the fourth where he discerned in the middle distance
a great thick column sloping upward from the ground
at about a thirty degree angle rising so high into the air
that he was unable to see its end it seemed to go right
up into the indistinguishable blue of the heavens them-
selves and beyond that he could just make out in
the hazy distance what was apparently a high wall but
that did not interest him yet it was the column set
alone in all the vastness of this great pattern that at-
tracted him it was his whole future for the present

  amid the falling things from the air he started to
pick his way toward the column half-consciously dodg-
ing the debris that piled itself up on the ground in a
hotch-potch varying the natural color of the red plain
with their own shades they seemed for the most part
fragments of animal vegetable and mineral matter
they blocked his path making it necessary to circle them
where it was impossible to climb over them they were
unstable rolling under his feet and what with jumping
out of the way of those still falling it was enough to
drive a man out of his senses but mike was unusually
phlegmatic able to take everything as a matter of course
at the same time realizing how unnatural this new place
was

  the ground under foot did not seem like a soil but a
vitrified substance from which the original life had been
decarbonized perhaps that accounted for the remain-
ing gloss that clung to the pitted surfaces but at last
he was able to leave the red plain behind as he stood on
the edge of his first canyon the dividing line between
red and blue plain carefully he made his way down
the side of the ravine which seemed sanded altogether
different from the surface of the plain he had just left
behind and it was different in color in the bottom of
the depression he saw half a dozen odd structures each
a great round globe many times his own size they
seemed balls of some transparent matter held in a state
of balance bright things in which light seemed at play
changing into all the colors of the rainbow as he stared
at them he dared reach out to touch the side of the
nearest sphere it was elastic it dented at his touch
he pushed hard upon it with the full force of his hand
the man who fought a fly



and to his horror the sphere bulged outward and be-
came a round sticky mouth that sucked him to the
spheres surface in the next instant he found himself
dragged over the surface spun around in a miniature
whirlpool one foot and hand remained free of the
stuff but for the rest of him he was caught like a fly
on a sticky paper unable to move unable to grasp any-
thing by which to pull himself free

  after his first fright was over he ceased struggling
long enough to consider what this strange ball might be
he noticed that whereas the stuff was sticky elastic it
did not seem to wet him at all there appeared to be
some sort of skin over the surface of the globe that
held its contents together protected it against contact
with him while it held him prisoner minutes hours
seemed to pass and then he noticed how cold he was
it was the sphere that was cold however it seemed to be
losing some of its original size at the same time it
was animated with a strange interior force that lifted
and stretched it with terrific power then the man felt
himself falling there was a violent shock as if an ex-
plosion had taken place quite near him and he found
himself on the ground the ball had disappeared

  without a minutes pause mike picked himself up and
ran wildly up the slope of the gulch to the blue plain
regardless of the bruises he had sustained from his fall
he stopped breathless on its edge to look backward at
the transparent spheres below not one was left all
were gone exploded

  the surface of the blue plain hardly differed from
that of the red plain it also looked as if it were ossified
and there were the irregular piles of debris fallen from
the sky mounting as more came down his crippled leg
began to pain him as he pushed on and on toward the
strange tilted pillar set over in one corner of the blue
plain and after what had seemed an indeterminable
length of time he reached it he was tired weary and
hungry but there was nothing edible to be found here-
abouts nothing in this wild dreary land nothing in the
pockets of his blue working jeans he stood gazing at
the column for a while trying to peer upward to its end
it was several times his own girth its surface of no
material he could place it seemed fibrous filled with
hundreds of little cracks rough pitted he decided the
pillar must be very ancient

  it was however he concluded hardly worth the bother
of coming to see he turned his back upon it and
gazed off in the distance to the high precipice etched
across the far sky it seemed a great unbroken wall of
a mighty mountain range rising several thousand feet
into the air stretching further than eye could see in both
directions mountains suggested trees verdure water
food perhaps it suggested something else beside for
on his trek across the plains a single word had seemed
to crop persistently into his mind mary mary his
sluggish brain had repeated now something was sug-
gesting that mary was to be found on the mountain top
though for the life of him he could not tell where that
odd thought came from and exactly who mary was

  he decided to start off immediately but then he rea-
lized how tired and worn out he was first he must
sleep must rest his weary bones his crippled leg he
noticed suddenly that the rain of particles from the sky
was less heavy on the opposite side of the leaning pillar
from that which he had come at its foot practically no
debris fell at all he would lie there huddled against

the pillars foot and sleep awhile

  mike never knew exactly what had awakened him but
suddenly he was wide awake and frightened he felt
eyes upon him the hair on the nape of his neck was
rising he gasped when he saw the thing facing him a
great black creature with six hairy legs and two eyes
that were divided and sub-divided into a thousand dif-
ferent parts each part carrying a reflection of himself
and never had he seen an uglier or more gruesome face
between the eyes the face was flat but below them it
bulged out into a most fearsome mouth with heavy jaws
that seemed more like tusks in size it was as big as an
elephant while on its back was a pair of gorgeous trans-
parent wings half-open now as if the thing was pre-
pared for flight at a moments notice it exuded a
strong penetrating odor that reminded mike of decay-
ing flesh putrefaction

  how long the creature had been surveying him he
did not know a scream rose to his throat as it took
a step toward him a step backward brought mikes
back against the great leaning column its solidity felt
good there behind him it was safety of a sort and he
took another step backward pressed against the pillar
away from the creature the beast in consequence
took a step toward him trying to outstare him with its
many eyes while two long horns that mike had not
noticed before waved in front of its face his own eyes
darted this way and that in search of a weapon of some
sort and he saw a long rough stick that could serve him
as a club lying close by it meant however taking a
step toward the elephantine animal and in his extremity
mike even dared this he was surprised to see the beast
take a step backward as he moved forward ah the
thing was cowardly

  the club was heavy almost too heavy for mike but
by grasping it with two hands he succeeded in lifting it
above his head the beast watched him dumbly and
mike took the offensive with all his might he brought
the stick downward in a great circle toward the beasts
glistening eyes but when the stick landed the thing
wasnt there he heard the hum of its wings as it took
to the air then around him grew the sound of a roar
a deep booming noise like thunder coming from its
thorax he wheeled about to see the creature dropping
to the ground on the other side of him and again he
struck out with his club

  this time the club caught one of the creatures wings
tearing it across so it could never use it again it
started back from him but changing its mind charged
upon the man again mike raised his heavy club to
bring it down on the beasts clumsy head one of the
waving horns was broken and the jagged head of the
stick cut a furrow through the left eye of the beast
half-blinding it the roar of the beast grew louder and
again it charged and again mike struck out with his
club a hairy claw racked his back but it did not touch
the skin merely tearing the cloth of his jeans off his
shoulder he lost count of its charges as he placed his
heavy blows with precision and each blow counted
against the beast one eye was entirely gone the other
had only half its sight two legs were crippled the sec-
ond wing was frayed it seemed to have lost all sense
of direction when another blow tore the other horn
away from the top of the beasts head now it no longer
roared and suddenly gave up the battle crawling hastily
away from the enraged man but mike with the lust


amazing

stories

of battle in his veins was not through yet bringing
the club high above his head and as far back as his arms
would go he gave a mighty heave that sent it after the
retreating creature the point entered the hard black
body just between the sagging wings carrying it to the
ground it lay where it fell legs twitching a low mur-
mur issuing from its body

  it was a gruesome sight with red sticky blood oozing
from its many wounds but mike did not have it in his
heart to pity it he stood off to survey it wondering
what it was what was so familiar about it

  why its a fly he said at last and after he had
spoken the words he wondered at them a fly what
was a fly why what why should he recognize
the creature why was he here what was he doing
in this oddly familiar land that after all was unfamiliar

  one after another the man put these questions to him-
self but he was at a loss to answer them his mind was
in a queerly muddled state faint dim memories came
to him he was always on the verge of understanding
things yet on the other hand his mind refused him the
answers was unable to collect them properly and cata-
logue them for himself he was aware of the fact that
something untoward had happened to him that this was
not his natural world that nothing around him was
natural he remembered falling asleep here on this blue
plain beside the leaning column he remembered the
ravine he had left behind but he could not remember
what lay there before his awakening on the red plain

  and here was this fly incident he seemed to recall
that in the past he had killed other flies many flies that
it was his business to kill flies he could turn his back
on it and leave it to kick away the rest of its life with-
out compunction but that did not explain what a fly
was why he knew it for what it was

  shrugging his shoulders he turned his back on the
pillar his eyes toward the mountain range dimly visible
in the distance the queer rain from the skies was less
now and rarely a boulder came within touching distance
of him and he could see it falling toward him long before
it reached the point where he had been a second coulee
opened to him and across it lay a second red plain like
the first he had left behind in his mind he called the
plains squares but like the fly incident he could not find
the source of his knowledge he was suddenly thirsty
and that desire transcended every other thought

  standing on the edge of the ravine a shout welled to
his lips for in the bottom of the crevice was a shining
river water he fairly ran down the side of the
ravine but at the waters edge he came to an abrupt halt
certainly he had never seen an odder stream of water
it had no movement it did not appear to flow yet it
wasnt stagnant it was clear it just lay there in the
hollow inert and wherever it touched the shore its
edges curled up hollowed out rather and it became con-
cave a large boulder lay in the stream a half a dozen
feet from where mike stood and the water also seemed
to repel it it was in fact indented all around the
boulder forming a hollow depression around it

  strange strange world

  puzzled mike bent down toward the water deter-
mined to taste it to learn if it were truly water but no
-as he bent toward it it moved came forward to meet
him he drew back frightened and suddenly remem-
bered the antics of the sphere in the bottom of the first
canyon in his mind he was able to associate the two
but he could not explain them a sigh escaped him was

there no succor for him in this hard land where all
natural laws seemed topsy-turvy just how long wa
he going to be able to exist without drink or food 

  and how was he to bridge this unique river could
he throw enough debris to form a bridge to cross on
stopping he picked up a small boulder close at hand
the river received it without a splash but the thing
did not sink immediately it was a slow process before
the water-stuff sucked it below the surface he shook
his head wearily realizing it would take hours to fill in
a causeway at that rate instead he decided to walk on
and discover if he could-not find a bridge already pre-
pared

  ten minutes of walking brought him to a place where
the river came to an end although the canyon floor
was no higher the river simply ended abruptly he con-
cluded it was a lake instead of a river the climb up
the other side of the ravine was difficult for here was
a heavy mass of sky-debris that impeded his progress
but at last he climbed to the surface of the second red
plain he lost all count of time as he headed for the
mountain range his body appeared to be a number
of individuals all crying for attention there was his
thirst together with hunger and the lame leg all clamour-
ing for service he stumbled on and on until the red
plain suddenly came to an end he was ready to stop
there and lie down to die but on lifting his head his
blurred eyes showed him that this was the last ravine
before he should reach the foot of the mountains he
thought he could descry something green a few hundred 
feet above him on the side of the mountain in that bit
of green he saw promise of food and maybe of drink

  only god what was this thing hurrying down the
ravine toward him so might a dinosaur have appeared to
primitive man he saw a long yellowish green serpen-
tine body several times his own length topped by a
massive hideously ugly head while set along the length
of the body were small upright bunches of bristles at
intervals although the beast walked the bottom of the
coulee the bristles showed above the edge of the gulch

  mike started back frightened almost out of his wits
as the thing suddenly turned toward his side of the
ravine and started up the side its head was on the
level with his own before he could control his shaking
knees but before he could take a step backward the
beast switched from his path and passed the frightened
man without a second glance his way mike smelt the
heavy earthly odor the beast exuded as it passed him by

  lord its a caterpillar he found himself ejacu-
lating and he was recalling that caterpillars afterall
were harmless creatures herbivorous he scurried
down the bank of the depression and up the other side

  on on he trudged over the rough terrain of the plain
his head sunk between sagging shoulders only occa-
sionally lifting his head to see how much of the distance
toward the mountain he had covered he glanced back-
only once but found he could no longer see the leaning
pillar that had been his first goal distances were
strangely deceptive in this weird land possibly due to
the quality of the light but he was beyond questioning
anything he could only think of that patch of green
far up on the mountain side which he could make out
more plainly now but he eyed the mountain itself in fear
it seemed a great perpendicular cliff rising straight up
to the heavens impossible for a man to climb the
plain appeared to end abruptly at the cliffs foot as if
the mountain was not part and parcel of the land but
the man who

fought a fly



had been placed there at some later period than placing
of the plains but as he drew nearer and stood at the
mountain foot he realized it was not as unscalable as it
had appeared at first the surface was fibrous and
pitted with irregularities where boulders and soil had
taken footing and he could make out a number of long
crevices mounting upward there were innumerable
hand and foot holds in which he could find easy pur-
chase he wondered at the queer structure of the cliff
itself it was certainly different from any mountain he
had ever known at places it was soft to the touch
giving under hand or foot breaking under him some-
times and sending flakes of tissue falling behind him

  thirst and hunger were forgotten as he began to
make his way upward but every few feet he had to take
time to rest then after an indeterminable passage of
time he reached the green verdure that had beckoned
to him from afar it was a small plot of moss and
lichen clinging to the mountain wall a small green
bush covered with red and yellow berries had
taken root in the moss food

  he knew it was food for here were two bright green
creatures hardly four feet in length ugly but harmless
as they proved feeding on the berries they scurried
away at his approach and immediately he appropriated
their dinner the-berries were sweet juicy and filling
practically all the berries were gone before he filled his
stomach they gave him new life they quenched his
thirst almost regretfully he deserted them but the
mountain was calling him upward

  he was more than three-quarters of the way up the
mountain when he glanced backward now he saw
the regular pattern of the red and blue plains he had
left behind with their geometrically straight crevices
crossing and recrossing as far as eye could see dimly
he could discern great shapes in the greater distances
but he was at a loss to name them yet again he felt
their familiarity felt that he had known them in his
past he felt a yearning to be back in the life he could
not recall a yearning for his own kind for life as he
had once known it

  but now he was tired weary too weary to go on he
needed sleep more than he needed anything else he
looked about seeking a safe spot where he might stow
himself while renewing his lifes forces a shelf a dozen
feet or so above his head jutted a few feet over the
cliffs edge it offered haven hand over hand he pulled
himself toward it head down as he picked out safe holds
for hands and feet thus he was unaware of the
creature emerging from a cave that opened upon the
ledge he sought the creature however saw him

  and what a creature more than six feet high it
stood reddish brown in color with an abnormally long
body separated into three segments-head thorax and
abdomen the thorax and abdomen being separated by an
incredibly narrow waist it was six-legged and it had
a pair of multi-faceted eyes that had the power of seeing
in practically every direction but it depended more
upon the finer selectivity of the pair of antennas sticking
out from the head just over the eyes that waved con-
stantly in the air its mouth was a most savage one
great heavy mandibles that looked as if they might bite
the climbing man in two at one stroke it stood per-
fectly still in the cave mouth eyeing the unwarned
climbing man and although not a sound issued from
its throat it was suddenly joined by a fellow creature
who came likewise from the cave and now stood beside

the first peering over its shoulder at the on-coming
prey	 

  poor mike it was an unfair fight from the first
tired and weary he did not raise his eyes until he had
climbed over the abutment then it was too late and
though he gave a good account of himself the pair of
ants had the advantage as they rushed from two sides
at once the first ant lost one of its antenna horns in
the struggle the second lost one of its middle legs then
mike felt the first ant plunge its mandibles into his shoul-
der and as soon as the sting bit into his flesh all fight
departed he was a prisoner

  although the first of the two red ants was larger than
its fellow it was the second creature who picked up
mikes suddenly limp form and tossed him over its
shoulder mike knew nothing of the journey through
the dark tunnels of the hill it was the bump that
occurred when his captor dropped him on a hard packed
floor that shook him back into consciousness but con-
sciousness did not bring movement in its train and mike
found his body numb paralyzed from the bite of the
insect that left only his mind awake

  after a while he could make out indefinite shapes in
the darkness around him and realized that he lay on
some soft decaying stuff that hurt his nostrils with its
fetid odors he felt rather than saw the comings and
goings of his captors through the chamber in which he
lay something dropped across the small of his back
and lay there heavily adding its heavy smell to the
others that nauseated him lying there he tried to piece
together the events that had brought him here but the
poison the beasts had injected into his blood seemed to
dull the edge of his brain

  he was unaware of the fact that now he was cold
storage in the warehouse of the red ants-preserved
against the time when he should become provisions in 
the ant vernacular if they had such a thing nature
has a number of tricks up her sleeve and lacking proper
refrigerant methods as devised by man she neverthe-
less has provided her pets the ants with a means of their
own to preserve food against the time when it is needed
this is a mild poison injected into the body of the
victims which paralyzes the nerve centers so that where-
as they are still alive they are incapable of crawling
away again and must simply await the hour of their
doom

  the paralysis of his nerves had caused mike to lose
all sense of time and he did not know how long he had
lain in his quiescent state he slept intermittently awak-
ing every now and then to the ugly odor of the nest
and decaying life around him but at last he believed
he could feel a loosening up of his muscles he could
move a finger then a hand then his head possibly the
fact that he came of a more highly developed genus
than the ordinary victim of the ants was the reason why
the paralysis was deserting him he flexed the muscles
of one arm then of the other and tried to sit up but
the weight lying across his hips held him down it took
a number of squirms to release him but at last he was
free

  stretching his body he took several deep breaths only
to be nauseated anew by the thick odors surrounding
him he wondered heavily how he was to get out of this
noxious place something told him he must be away
before the next returning forage came with its burden
dimly he made out the faintly illuminated circle that
was the doorway from this chamber cautiously he


amazing stories

crawled toward it hoping to escape from his prison

  there seemed to be some sort of faint light filtering
down the tunnel that opened to him so he could see the
passage walls losing themselves somewhere ahead if
only he had a weapon of some sort he thought but he
was unarmed moving forward about a hundred feet
in the tunnel he heard a noise coming his way there
was a dry scratching as of feet upon the hard packed
floor and of something being dragged along a new
odor came to his nostrils it was an ant bringing part
of a butterfly wing mike backed up slowly away from
the approaching sound and so he stumbled and fell
heavily something hard lay under him and he felt
for it with his hands it was a fragment -of rock that
he had tripped over he wrapped his fingers around it
hefted it and felt better because of it a darker blot
in the darkness of the tunnel told him the on-coming ant
was almost abreast of where he crouched against the
wall

  the thing stopped there was an almost illusionary
gleam of light where its eyes were and he heard a slith-
ering sound as the ant dropped its burden mike heaved
his rock where the eye had been he heard its scrunch
against something brittle then panic seized him it gave
momentum to his feet carrying him swiftly up the tunnel
in the direction from which the ant had came and he
was in the midst of a half a dozen beasts before he knew
it two tunnels crossed each other at this juncture the
party was herding a number of aphides ant-cows back
to their stables but when the creatures found a new
being in their midst the combined thought was to re-
capture him this time mike used hands and feet to
full advantage a hairy leg snapped under one hand
and it in turn became a bludgeon against his enemies
for several moments he crouched under the abdomen of
an ant and here it proved difficult for the others to reach
him until the ant itself managed to twist its body about
so as to make his strategy of no avail fighting with
flaying arms and feet he managed to reach the nearest
wall the tunnel seemed to overflow with ants and the
herd of cows increased the melee so that the beasts be-
came so jammed they found it impossible to move one
way or the other as more and more came piling in from
all directions

  it was almost a noiseless battle with only the scraping
and grating of dry feet on the soil or of chiton-covered
bodies rubbing against each other and the deep panting
breath of the man fighting for life and freedom

  mikes greatest care was to keep the mandibles of the
beasts from any part of his body to prevent a second
injection of the formic acid into his system but though
mandibles snapped around him they were poorly aimed
so closely packed were their wielders only those ants
on the edge of the pack against the wall of the tunnel
could reach the man who was creeping as close to the
floor as the forest of legs would permit

  as he battled he crept forward an inch at a time
leaving a trail of broken legs twisted antenna and
maimed bodies behind him his clothing hung to him
in tatters his face and hands were scratched and torn
blood flowed from a wound on one temple getting into
his eyes and there were several long scratches on back
and chest his breath wheezed as it came through his
clenched teeth blood trickled from one distended nos-
tril and his blows were growing weaker it was only
a question of minutes now before the very weight of
numbers would pull him down he hardly knew what

happened when the wall crumbled behind him and he
fell headlong into the narrow opening thus revealed a
pair of mandibles snapped harmlessly over his head as he
fell and there was a scraping of rough feet as the beast
tried to widen the mouth of the hole into which mike
had fallen

  hardly aware of what had saved him so providential-
ly the man sought to rise only to bang his head sharply
against the low ceiling of the chamber in which he found
himself bringing kindly oblivion he awakened to a
new sense of motion to find he was being dragged along
the low tunnel into which the crumbling wall had
catapulted him for his cave turned out to be a tunnel
running at right angles to the one in which he had
fought even now the ants were trying with feet and
mandibles to widen the tunnel mouth for their bulky
bodies but the passage proved too low and narrow for
them the ant who had been behind mike when he
fell even now lay crushed by the numbers in the open-
ing behind it and the others were trying to remove it
piecemeal

  for a moment the darkness here seemed blacker than
in the tunnel he had just left behind but after a few
moments of concentration mike managed to make out
the shapes of the creatures dragging him they seemed
a smaller edition of the ants he had left behind one
had him by the hair the other had caught its mandibles
in the shoulder strap of his overalls the pain of being
dragged by the hair had restored him to consciousness
with a mighty effort he managed to twist his body
around so that he could put his hands upon the floor of
the tunnel even though the movement caused him fright-
ful pain and he was ready to do battle again but he
was saved that the first ant dropped its hold upon his
hair at his first upheaval and the other little fellow was
frantically trying to tear its mandibles from the shoulder
strap it succeeded just as mike gained his hands and
feet and he could hear the pair running hurriedly from
his proximity

  carefully mike felt the tunnel walls about him and
learned that nowhere was the diameter of the tunnel
more than two feet it meant he would have to crawl on
hands and feet its entire length but considering the in-
clination of the floor he gathered that the passage
eventually rose to the surface he guessed that he was
safe from his erstwhile six-foot enemies but it was a
back-breaking task to crawl along for what seemed
hours on hands and knees twice he came to cross-tun-
neels and he grew aware of small creatures scurrying
away from his lumbering approach only their ant-
like appearance gave him clue to what his rescuers were
but he knew too little of ant-life to guess at how the
tiny robber-ant constructs its nest to dovetail with that
of the large red ant like the mice preying on a human
household these tiny foragers made their excursions into
the storerooms and granaries of their unwilling hosts
fleeing to their narrow tunnels where the larger ants
could not follow when their thieving proclivities were
discovered

  as he continued upward mike noticed the tunnel
growing brighter as light filtered in from some source
far ahead then he thought he descried a pin-point of
gray light and it gave him new life the pin-point of
light grew steadily larger and at last he reached an open-
ing a guardsman ant stood in the entrance but it
scurried away at his approach and he was free to step
into the green world of the mountain top the robber
the man who

fought a fly



tunnel had led him directly up to the plateau of the
mountain-range

  before him lay a wide land beyond which he could
see a mighty forest of every sort of tree and plant im-
aginable bedecked with flowers and swept by sweet fresh
clean breezes paradise after hell

  cautiously he crawled forth peering on every side
for lurking enemies his first thought was a weapon
a round dry stick lay close to the tunnel opening and
this he quickly appropriated a small round stone that
fitted to his hand tempted him next and he dropped it
into his pocket for safe-keeping he saw that here
again the air was filled with falling rocks fibrous woody
sticks of debris blocks of solid metal the forest
offered protection from the attack from the skies but it
was a long way off still there was no reason to linger
here and he feared that the nest of the red ants might
have their exit somewhere near

  the way across the barren-lands as he named the
space lying between him and the forest was exceedingly
difficult the ground was spongy under foot and the
landscape almost mountainous he had to pick his way
carefully usually following an arroyo that seemed the
remains of a dry water-course using every out-jutting
promontory as a protection from the raining skies

  he was hungry thirsty and weak from his past experi-
ences and loss of blood at times everything went black
before his eyes he grew dizzy and went reeling and
stumbling along not caring what should happen then
when he thought he could not take another step when
his tongue felt like flannel-cloth in his mouth he came
upon a bed of moss in which grew a bush covered with
red and yellow berries like those he had found on the
mountain side again he feasted ravenously and
thought of lying down for some sleep but twice when
he sought rest he had been attacked by the horrible beasts
of this terrible world and besides there was no cover
from the skies and he had to go on on to the trees

  climbing to the top of a tor or small hill that stood
higher than the surrounding country to take his bear-
ings he was suddenly elated by the sight of a monstrous
statue set alone in all this wilderness it reminded him
of the leaning pillar that had interested him back on the
plains there was no path leading to it but he felt that
if he could reach it many things would be explained

  the statue represented an ugly foreign yellow face
with squinty almond-shaped eyes its garments were
strange foreign looking and there was something
familiar about it he tried to remember where he had
seen a like statue a vague glimmering of the truth
assaulted his brain but again he was unable to trace out
its meaning his mind seemed to refuse to function past
a certain point the statue however was a sign a sign
that there must be creatures somewhere around who had
built it he climbed to the pedestal and gazed in all
directions and thu he caught a gleam of water in the
distance and a great high bridge crossing it now far
beyond the water lay the outpost of the forest

  he started to run toward the lake but his muscles re-
belled so he was forced to take it at a walk that was
hardly more than a crawl as he was creeping painfully
around the obstructions that filled his path sometimes
losing his direction continually dodging the debris from
the skies then he came to the lake

  chagrined he stared with popping eyes it wasnt a
lake after all but a hard clear surface that reflected his
image he gazed at himself in disappointment whajt

a sight he was an inch long stubble covered his face
his hair was a sweaty mass caked with dried blood dirt
streaked his face and hands where they were not
scratched and bruised his jeans were in tatters hanging
to him by threads his face was thin haggard

  getting to his feet he stared at the bridge crossing the
mirror lake he sneered what sort of people were
they who built a bridge over a surface of such a type
he disdained to use the bridge and stepped upon the
imitation lake instead it was not so smooth as it ap-
peared at first glance it was bumpy with irregularities
in its surface bubbles showed just under the skin and
it was difficult to walk upon like ice but anything was
better than the surrounding country and he wanted to
reach the trees sky debris fell upon the mirror as on
everything else adding to his difficulties pebbles rolled
under his feet as he walked

  the mirror-lake did not reach to the edge of the woods
and carefully he began picking his way anew over the
rough uneven ground there it was he heard the first
call

  help help for gods sake someone save me
mike mike

  a voice a living voice and wonders and wonders he
knew the voice it was calling him mike mike save
me

  mary im coming im coming he was surprised
to hear his own voice answer

  it came from the middle of the trees ahead mary
needed hint he did not stop to question who mary was
he knew mary was part of him mary was his and
she needed him

  he was running now between hillocks unconsciously
dodging the falling fragments from the sky every-
thing was forgotten his weariness was of the past he
forgot his lame foot he reached the trees great thick-
stalked trees many times his own girth that had queer
straight branches out of which grew giant leaves many
yards across then there were strange blade-like
growths rising straight from the ground to unguessed
heights gargantuan flowers topped the strange trees
and filled him again with a sense of his own puniness
but this was not the time to consider such things

  mike oh mike will you never come 

  im coming im coming

  here the trees were at well spaced intervals but as he
hurried on toward the voice he found himself plunging
into a wild tangle of rank undergrowth-the like of
which he had never seen saw-toothed grasses taller
than his own head brambles spine-covered vines tore
at him held him back and every step he took was a fight
in itself he had only made a few feet of progress to-
ward the moaning voice when a great shadow swept
over him and the air was filled with a roaring thunder
of sound

  he ducked to the left without looking into a thicket
of brambles that cut him cruelly but the brambles were
better than the death swooping upon him in the shape
of a long snake-shaped body upheld by twin pairs of
wide transparent wings iridescent wings each yards
across he cowered among the thick fleshy leaves of
the bramble-bush realizing he was safe from the mon-
strous flying thing it seemed ages before the dragon-
fly gave up hope of an easy meal and departed with an
ear-crushing whoosh of its lovely wings

  mike did not climb from the brambles for several
minutes after the fly was gone then he painfully ex-


amazing stories

tracted himself from the thorns leaving a good part of
what remained of his clothing adhering to the vicious
spikes again he heard the beckoning terrified voice
calling and he renewed his efforts to push through the
clinging jungle

  then he saw her she was almost in his path and at
first glance he thought she was merely standing there
looking at him but the second glance showed her a
prisoner a strange shapeless bundle hanging in a
cocoon within a foot or so of the ground wrapped
around with thick heavy cords as thick as his thumb
there were other ropes dirty white ropes caught to the
leaves and branches of two great trees and he traced
them upward to a spot high above him where they
seemed joined in a hub with innumerable other ropes
coming from all directions on one of the ropes high
above the hub was the round black eight-legged figure
of the owner of the web he knew it for a spider im-
mediately and realized that mary was the spiders
prisoner

  she saw him as soon as he saw her and tears sprang
into her eyes mike where have you been come
get me out of here before that devil from hell comes
this way i    i    she began to sob pitifully un-
controllably

  the mans heart was full at the sight of her he
wanted to take her in his arms to soothe her fears but
first she must be freed he came to her side and grasped
one of the ropes to try its strength only to find it horribly
sticky so his hand adhered to it it took real effort to
pull the hand away if only he had a knife but in
lieu of that he looked for a sharpened stick the ropes
he found were quite elastic their real strength lying in
their sticky covering

  hes coming hes coming quick mike he will stab
me again 

  he looked up to see the spider hurrying down a rope
towards them it had felt the shaking of the rope and
was coming to investigate mike remembered the stone
in his pocket and let it fly at the oncoming arachnid the
missile seemed to stun the creature for a moment but
again it came on mike espied a long pole lying in a
tangle of brambles he could use it as a spear to keep
the spider away from mary at least mary was moan-
ing then suddenly she was filling the air with one pro-
longed shriek after another

professor duncan trent ushered his emi-
nent friend and guest dr yowell morely entomolo-
gist into his pleasant laboratory after the long drive from
the station dr morely had hurried from new york to
see his friend on receiving a note requesting his presence
there in regard to a new ray trent had just discovered
they came into the bright room laughing and talking
wholly unprepared for the sight to meet their eyes

  my t-ray lamp it was trent who cried out
as he pointed a shaking finger at the spot where his latest
invention lay on the floor beside a fallen chair his
friend was forgotten as he rushed to pick up the lamp
examining it to see if it were damaged

  someones been using it he ejaculated the bulb
is still warm though it has burnt out they were here
less than ten minutes ago for the ray burns out the
filament in that time oh the vandals the    oh mike
mike mike and calling the name of his man-of-
all-work the professor ran out of the laboratory morely

   spiders like the ants anaesthetize their victims against the time when
they need them for food

could hear his voice resound throughout the house
then it came from the garden

  the doctor left to his own devices shrugged his
shoulders smiling a little to himself he bent over ad
picked up the fallen chair that lay against one of the
window flower-boxes he dropped into the chair and
sat there his eyes ranging over the flower-boxes so
artfully arranged pains had been taken to make the
box appear like a japanese garden with little men and
women pretty bridges and what not set about among
the plants with the aid of a small mirror a lake had
been formed a dragon fly hovered over some blossoms
and there was the open door of an ant-hill to be con-
templated by the entomologist an ugly little weed
caught his eye and reaching down he removed it then
there was something else that drew his wandering atten-
tion

  he saw a tiny newly constructed spiders web stretch-
ing across two small ferns amid a tangle of some more
weeds that had been neglected he could make out the
agitation of the webs tiny gwner and because his voca-
tion was also his hobby he drew out his magnifying glass
to see what troubled the tiny home-maker he brought
it close to the scene taking place there among the weeds
and a whistling exclamation escaped his lips

  at that moment professor trent reentered the room
half-talking to himself cant find that confounded
fellow anywhere or his wife either well of all the
blankety-blank    coming in through the french
window he had not noticed where he was going and the
air was suddenly blue as the man of science shook water
out of his shoes he had stepped on the edge of one of
the fallen water cans tipping the remaining water over
his feet

  dune old man come here you had better identify
these   

  trent recognized the excitement in his friends voice
and the next instant was peering with unbounded won-
der at the spectacular drama taking place under the lense
of the magnifying glass he saw an incredibly tiny man
battling what to him must have seemed a monstrous
spider while in a cocoon in the spiders web hung an
hysterical woman

 good lord mike and mary the ray a com-
plete success but whatever possessed mike to   

  morely interrupted as he drew forth a pair of pincers
from an inner pocket no matter why theyre there
weve got to rescue them hed never kill that spider with
that straw as he spoke he picked the spider from the
nest with his pincers and crushed it a piece of paper
please he added to trent as carefully now he drew the
threads of the spider silk away from around the woman
a few moments later he was placing the frightened al-
most microscopic woman on the broad expanse of white
paper trent had brought the man was placed beside
the woman and under the magnifying glass the two saw
the tiny man take the womans fainting form into his
arms

  carefully transferring the paper to a table-top nearby
the doctor looked at trent with twinkling eyes in-
dubitably my friend your new rays are a success but
have you the means of returning these unusual speci-
mens of homo sapiens to their original size

  that will be simple you see i perfected the s-ray
or enlarging ray before i ever thought about this reduc-
ing ray at all in fact the t-ray is simply a by-product
of the s-ray i have already mentioned to you but what
the man who fought a fly



i cant understand is what led mike to do such a thing
hes a steady sort of a fellow never did a prank like
this before in his life

  morely inclined his head toward the spilled watering
cans id hardly attribute this prank as you call it to
the man according to the position of the ray-lamp and
the chair and that can over there i should suppose the
man was in the act of rescuing his wife when he fell
carrying everything to the floor with him you see   
by george youre right but mary is supposed
never to come in here she has none of the intelli-
gence of mike and i dont like her fussing around in
my laboratory

  has she a touch of rheumatism or something of the
sort 

  why perhaps ive never inquired said trent
stiffly not seeing where this questioning was leading to

  but havent you noticed my friend that you have
mounted the t-ray apparatus in a lamp shade similar to
those sold on the market for dispensing the beneficial
ultra-violet ray if im not mistaken theres its mate
in the comer

  by george that is a sun-ray lamp over there i used
it on some cultures with which i wanted to prove my
experiment to you 

  um and your mary must have gotten them mixed
youre right i see it lll now here help me rig
up this s-ray paraphernalia better put them on the
floor hadnt we as the pair discoursed trent had
been putting together an odd-looking machine with
which he intended to bring back mary and mike

it was a matter of minutes before the now uncon-
scious man and woman were almost back to their
original size- morely watched them grow with a scien-
tific eye exclaiming at their rapid return to normalcy
noticing that as they grew larger their bodily growth
seemed to slow down correspondingly

  there exclaimed trent that seems to be about
right i think that is mikes normal size dont want
to make a giant of him and he turned off the red ray
of the apparatus from the pair

  morely sucked in his breath your man looks like
very much of a tramp dune i think he might shave
occasionally and what a slattern his wife is the
pair still under the coma induced by the ray could not
hear his biting slander

  whats that  why they are a sight arent they  but
mike was clean-shaven this morning and ive never
before seen mary with a hair out of place let alone a
soiled apron by george of course let me see you
remember i said the bulb of the t-ray was still warm
when i picked it up that means that they were under
the influence of the ray not ten minutes before we ap-
peared on the scene but think of it yo those two had
endured all sorts of hardships in that few minutes what
seems minutes to us must have been days if not weeks
to them in their reduced state for naturally with the
reduction of size came the speeding up of heart-beats
and of bodily actions that accounts for mikes un-
shaven appearance and look how tired and haggard
he looks i bet hes lost some weight too

quiet mikes coming out of it that was morely
a deep groan came from the man on the floor he
winked his eyes against the light closing them quickly
again as if it made him dizzy but he opened them
directly and tried to sit up trent said not a word as he

permitted the man to get his bearings now the woman
was moaning making mumbling sounds under her
breath

  morely helped mike to sit up feeling his pulse as he
did so the man became aware of those administering
to him tried to get to his feet take your time mike
its all right put in trent

  it was some time before the pair were fully cognizant
of their surroundings however trent and morely had
gotten mary to a couch against a far wall and left her
there to recover by herself then they were helping mike
to orientate himself once more but gradually it was
coming back to him he wanted to speak and after the
men had insisted upon him seating himself in the chair
morely had quitted earlier he began to talk first in dis-
jointed sentences then more rationally and they heard
his story as he relived his experiences of the past ten
minutes or so

  in the middle of the telling he suddenly drew in his
breath sharply the spider-you saved mary and me
from sir that part seemed vague to him

  well tell you about that later observed trent-
tell us all you remember from the beginning while
its still alive in your mind do you recall everything

  everything sir its all clear now now i under-
stand all i could not comprehend    down there 

  you know what happened to you how it hap-
pened 

  why yes sir it was mary begging your pardon for
her sir shes had a touch of neuritis though i told
her she wasnt to use your sun-ray light for it well
i was late in watering the flowers and i came in to see
her sitting under your new-ray lamp shrinking  

  yes what did you do when you saw her under the
ray 

  i knew immediately that she had switched lamps
sir i dropped my cans and made a dash for her only i
must have tripped and the next thing i knew i was
sitting in the middle of a red plain   

  a red plain  the professor stared at the floor his
face bright you mean one of those tiles there

  yes sir i was in the middle of one of those red tiles
and it looked like a vast plain all rough and hilly and
when i stood up a could see the blue plains beyond the
cracks then i saw a great leaning pillar good
heavens sir that must have been a leg of this very chair
in which im sitting and he went on to describe the
appearance of the pillar

  from this point mike told the whole story his dis-
covery of the transparent spheres in the first coulee his
fight with the fly the strange stream of water the ap-
pearance of the caterpillar et cetera the others heard
him through to the end and now mike insisted on rising
and placing the chair as it was when morely found it
they located the exact spot where the chair leg had
stood when the body of the dead fly was found unmo-
lested where it had fallen and there was still a tiny
trickle of water in the canyon where he had found his
lake

  thats one of the things i could not understand sir
the queer action of the water i seemed to know it was
water and yet it acted so strangely    and he ex-
plained about the surface skin of the sphere and the
river

  trent explained to him the law of capillary attraction
together with the law of expansive forces the body of
water which mike discovered in the cement between the


amazing stories

tiles lay on an absorbent substance therefore the
edges had appeared conclave although had it been an
non-absorbent substance it would have appeared just
the opposite the surface tension of the skin was due
to the molecular forces in liquids that tend to bring
about cohesion of all parts

  and those spheres that grabbed me up and then ex-
ploded

  water droplets nothing less youd just finished
mopping the floor you know and those droplets had not
yet evaporated when they did evaporate into vapor
the expansion force produced your terrific explosion 

  then there were those falling particles in the air
at first they were troublesome but beyond the chair-
leg the fall was lessened until i reached the top of the
mount-er flower-box

  they were dust-motes mike you can appreciate
the fact that our air is filled with dust particles we see
them more readily when falling through a beam of sun-
light but we know they are falling continually because
of the manner in which they collect on surface our
bodies furniture et cetera under the microscope
these dust motes appear to consist of organic mineral
and metallic particles that you did not find so many
beyond your pillar was because you were under the
chair seat which partially protected you 

  continuing to trace his pilgrimage across the tiles
mike found the spot where he had begun to mount the
side of the flower-box which he had taken for a moun-
tain-cllff by using the magnifying glass they could find
the cracks and crevices that had been his footholds the
bit of lichen that had taken root in the moss where he
had dined oh microscopic berries morely plucked the
tiny plant and put it away carefully for later analyses
next they found mikes ledge and the ant-hill entrance
they even saw an ant on duty at the entrance neither
man spoke when mike put out his finger and squashed
the little beast it was revenge

  he laughed when he saw the wilderness through which
he had wandered the statue was one of the japanese
statesmen he himself had put in place and the mirror
caused him to chuckle how it had fooled him and
what idiots he had thought the giants were who had
placed a bridge over the imitation lake and his trees
were the small plants he had set out had he but cleared
away those tiny weeds yesterday he would not have
had such a struggle through the morass to get to mary
shreds of the spider web were found scarcely two inches
from mirror lake how far it had been to the poor
flea-high man that he had been

  morely was most interested in the events in the ant-
hill he told mike what the tiny creatures were to whom
he owed his life it was trent however who brought
up a point in mikes story that seemed most puzzling
it seems strange mike he observed that you ap-
peared to have no cognizance of the fact that you had
been so reduced in size you speak of your adventures
as if you imagined you had been transplanted to some
strange land with only the hazard unreal remembrances
of your true life surely that crack on your head wasnt
enough to   

  wait dune i think i could explain that better put
in morely its this way by rather elaborate alge-
braic calculations cuvier and eugene dubois the learned
physiologist celebrated for discovering the pithecan-
thropus of java when he was in the colonial service
there afterwards professor in the university of am-

sterdam have established the fact that the specific brain-
weight of a species of animal cannot fall below a certain
proportion in relation to the weight of the body if the
normal intelligence of the species is to be maintained
among the monkeys which are the most intelligent group
of anthropoid mammals the individual cannot be smaller
than an ouistit which has a brain one twenty-iourth the
weight of his total body-weight of ten and one-half
ounces imagine this monkey one-third the size and you
find that he will need a brain one-sixteenth of his body
to enjoy the same degree of intelligence on the other
hand less intelligent animals like certain insectivora
have a weight of barely one-tenth of an ounce and a
brain one-fortieth their weight which is sufficient for
their slight mental activity by the same calculation it
is shown that a man to possess average intelligence can
not weigh less than thirty-three and a half pounds 
now in mikes case his reduction in size meant a
relative loss of brain-activity thereby giving him just
enough intelligence to safeguard him in the new world
he found himself in and of consequence memory and
constructive rational thinking were practically beyond
hinj he could name things he saw because they were
so thoroughly impressed upon his brain but when he
tried to use his thinking processes they simply rebelled
he was more animal than man unable to hold to abstract
thought-process long enough to comprehend things
clearly he was motivated to climb the mountain be-
cause reason told him there he would find food water
and shelter he was however enough man to hold to
his original purpose once it developed in his dulled brain
there was also the sub-conscious desire for his own
kind as he has already told you this thought reoccurred
at intervals that was the reason he could not visualize
mary or remember her clearly until he actually came into
physical contact with her

ah but mary remembered mike she called him
mary recalled mikes name because he was the only
protector she knew and she used his name as a child
frightened in the dark or hurt accidentally voices a
call for its mother its protector

  there was more said before the two scientists realized
that mike was in no condition to sit talking his cuts
and bruises needed immediate attention then mary
awoke from a nap she had taken herself once more
puzzled by her untidy appearance the men came to
her side and when she saw her husbands condition her
face went white then  it really happened  i didnt
dream about the jungle and-the spider

  piecemeal they got her story out of her how she had
awakened in a topsy-turvy world where sticks and boul-
ders larger than her head fell instead of rain she had
not moved from the spot where she first found herself
for some time too frightened to move she was then
hunger drove her searching for food she found some
berries to eat but she was disturbed by a fly the fly
paid her no heed but she went running wildly over a
ragged country dodging through the dust motes stum-
bling over every irregularity of the soil a grain was hill-
high to her then she had come to mikes lake but
she climbed the bridge and found a large building a
tiny summerhouse on top of the miniature bridge which
she took for some sort of a temple there was already
an inhabitant there a green aphid and she fled running

  quoted from fourth chapter of unsuspected marvels of the
universe to be unfolded if our eyes nose and brain
were improved by professor rene thevenin appearing in the sun-
day american weekly december  
the man who fought a fly



and tumbling down the bridge she had gone on to the
jungle mike had found only she discovered a way
where the weeds were not so thick and then she had
stumbled into the spiders web the spider anaesthetized
her with its sting and when she came to she was
wrapped around and around by the heavy cords of
spider-silk she had called for help from the only
source she knew mike and when she thought she could
not keep up her courage any longer he came to her she
had shrieked when she saw doctor morleys pincers de-
scending upon her from the heavens

  she admitted this had not been the first time she had
used the professors sun-lamp for her neuritis mike
had mentioned the professors new ray but he had
failed to say it was operated as the sun-ray was
operated she was duly contrite over her offense and
began to assure trent she would never make use of his
laboratory again but the professor waived aside her
apologies

 youve done me a greater favor than you know

mary i would never have dared use a human being
under the ray i knew how it would react upon organic
matter and i was content to experiment with mice et
cetera youve done science a great turn today at the
expense of your own nerves and i shall see that you get
a sun-ray lamp for your own use

  that was not all that professor trent did for mike
and mary he put a substantial sum of money in the
bank in their name and sent the pair on what he called
a second honeymoon to niagara the results of the ten-
minute sojourn in microscopia was written up in scien-
tific journals and was consequently pounced upon by a
tabloid editor who played with the story for several
weeks to the great enjoyment of the public so that for
a long while after mike was known as the man-who-
fought-a-fly mike however went on as if nothing
had happened though the affair left its mark upon him
in the first place he discovered that he was an inch taller
than his normal height and he had what amounted to a
fanatical antipathy toward flies ants and dragon-flies f

kempton had just witnessed the largest
and most spectacular fire of its history
some twenty years ago the keystone mill
had been the largest planing-mill and wood-
working establishment in the susquehanna
valley now the red demon of destruction had come
along and in a few hours had reduced it from a huge
two-story frame building covering a whole city block
to a vacant square littered with charcoal brick and
other debris for the last six years it had been aban-
doned and all its machinery and equipment had been
removed the land that it occupied was of low realty
value and this along with its huge size and dilapidated
condition made it a white elephant in the hands of its
late owner colonel jackson when the colonel died
two years ago he left this property along with another
smaller abandoned factory to his son horace jackson
jr after his fathers death young jackson made a
number of unsuccessful attempts to sell these properties
and then had left town and nobody had heard anything
of him since

  then one night the keystone mill had burned in a
most spectacular way a patrolman going his rounds
had discovered a small blaze down in one corner of the
first floor by the time he had rushed around the corner
to an alarm box and back again the whole first floor
on one side was burning in a number of places a few
minutes later when the apparatus arrived almost half
the building was in flames with such a start there was
no chance of saving the place and most of the efforts
of the fire department were directed towards soaking
nearby houses to protect them from flying sparks and
brands of course in such a weather-beaten and dilap-
idated structure a fire would spread only too quickly
but in this case it spread so fast that it seemed to fairly
jump along as patrolman mcguirk later remarked to
the chief why youd see part of the old place where
there wasnt any fire or sparks at all mebbe forty or
fifty feet from the nearest place that was blazin   
look back there a few seconds later and youd see enough
flames to swear there had been fire there for five
minutes

  hardly before the ruins were cold an investigation
was in progress chief anderson of the fire depart-
ment and elliot captain of detectives had secured the
services of two deputies from the state fire marshals
office at harrisburg the two insurance companies also
sent a number of investigators to learn as much as they
could about the whole business

  they took up the problem from all sides and carried
the investigation as far as they could but no tangible
evidence as to the cause of the fire was forthcoming
about all they had succeeded in doing was to convince

themselves that it was a case of arson but as to how
it was done they had not the faintest idea	

  suspicion of course pointed at once to young jack-
son but practically nothing was known about him or
his whereabouts rumor had it that he was engaged
in some post-graduate work in a western university at
the time of his fathers death somehow the family
fortune had diminished and when the colonels will was
read it was found that little remained besides the old
keystone mill and a smaller abandoned factory up on
wyoming street young jackson a tall lanky and
clean shaven individual had immediately sold the family
mansion and then tried to dispose of the two factory
properties in this he was unsuccessful and a short
time later he left town where his income came from
what he did or where he was nobody knew

  the ruins of the mill had been thoroughly and re-
peatedly searched for any clews or evidence but noth-
ing of a peculiar or suspicious nature was found except
a number of what appeared to be small glass marbles
of a grayish-blue color these seemed harmless enough
and surely didnt look like the parts of any infernal
machine but the fact of their being found in such a
place at such a time gave rise to some conjecture among
the investigators finally out of curiosity more than
anything else a few of these were sent to harrisburg
for analysis they were found to be composed of
crystalline quartz with a slight percentage of carbon
impurities to have a very high melting point and in
short they were incapable of any incendiary purposes

  by this time the investigation had reached an impasse
the men from the insurance companies gave up the hope
of getting any evidence and left town to locate young
jackson who from what information was available
seemed to be traveling somewhere in the south the
two deputies from harrisburg also gave up the case for
the time being and left for parts unknown

now one saturday morning about three weeks
after the fire captain anderson and chief elliot
were in the captains office going over the case again

  but chief said captain anderson thoughtfully
chewing an unlighted cigar the insurance was all in
young jacksons name so hes the only one to gain by
it hes supposed to be out of town but whats to stop
him from sneakin back here and firin the place then
when everythings quieted down hell come back to col-
lect his money

  mebbe so grunted chief elliot but how you gonna
prove it nobody saw him around    even the insur-
ance people havent found him yet and you can bet
that if he did do it hell have a mighty good story
cooked up by the time they find him whats more




amazing stories

what evidence have you  so far you have nothing but
suspicions

  well  we still have those funny little blue mar-
bles or whatever they are mused the captain

  bunk why its ridiculous to think that those quartz
balls could burn down a building even if they did
have something to do with it howre you gonna prove
that young jackson or anyone else for that matter
was the    

  yeah i know interrupted the captain but just
the same id like to know more about those little blue
pills  by the way remember professor clark   
physics teacher up at the high school  ive mentioned
him to you before hes the fellow who helped me out
oji that dope case last year just a young fellow but
believe me that fellow sure knows his science besides
hes no dub at practical commonsense reasoning seems
to get a huge kick out of playing the amateur detective
now and then anyhow i thought id see if he couldnt
help us out so i gave him a ring and told him to come
around here this morning as i had another little prob-
lem for him to exercise his cranium on    he ought
to be here any minute now

  humph grunted chief elliot lotta good thatll
do but i suppose we can let him have a few of those
little balls to play with  

  come in barked the captain as a knock sounded
on the door morning clark he addressed the so-
phisticated-looking young man who had just entered
the office the captain introduced chief elliot to the
professor sat down and then began

  well professor youve probably read the accounts
in the local papers about the fire at the keystone mill
a month or so ago

  yeah drawled professor clark saw the thing
from beginning to end i happened to be in the neigh-
borhood when the alarm struck so i dashed over acted
mighty funny didnt it

  thats just it replied the captain now to make
a long story short were almost sure it was a case of
arson but we have no clue or evidence as to how it was
done    except maybe these he said as he reached
across the desk and handed the professor a cigar box full
of the small quartz spheres we sent some of these to
harrisburg for analysis and they were found to be com-
posed of crystalline quartz with a trace of carbon im-
purities of course we dont know that they had any-
thing to do with the fire all we got is the suspicion
that naturally arises from finding such things in such a
place what we want you to do is to take these things
along with you and find out if there is any possible
way in which they could be used for incendiary pur-
poses  and if so how

  rather a stiff order eh mused professor clark
as he closed the cigar box by the way young horace
jackson owned the place didnt he

  uh-huh replied the captain

  hasnt been in town lately has he

  not to our knowledge insurance people havent
even found him yet

  so-o-o drawled the professor you know i
wouldnt be a bit surprised if these little spheres should
turn out to be the clue youre looking for captain
but i quite realize that you want concrete facts theres
a great gulf fixed between ye humble clue and the evi-
dence that convinceth the jury he grinned anyhow
ill let you know as soon as i get any results he said as

  he took up his hat and his box of marbles and departed

during the next few days captain anderson often
wondered if there really was anything in the fan-
tastic idea that those little spheres could have had any-
thing to do with the fire at the keystone mill he had
seen or heard nothing of the professor of course it
was quite evident that the solution of this mystery would
take time so    well the professor had assured him
that as soon as he got some concrete evidence he would
let him know but as the days went by and still noth-
ing was heard from the professor the matter slipped
from his mind in the daily and nightly business of man-
ipulating the long arm of the law

  but one morning on his way to the office he saw
and talked to chief elliot of the fire department for a
moment the chief was all steamed up about an acci-
dent that had happened the day before it seemed that
two of his pumpers had side-swiped each other up at
norcross street and th avenue while answering a
false alarm they were dented up rather well and
would be out of service for two or three days

  as the captain sat down at his desk and reached for
a bunch of reports someone opened the door and
entered

  good morning captain

  so its you professor said captain elliot as he
turned to greet the intruder thought it was one of
my men who got here too early i sit down and lets
hear about it i suppose you came about our little mys-
tery of the quartz balls

  yes replied the professor nonchalantly helping
himself to one of the captains cigars

  did you learn anything from them prof

  did you asked the professor disregarding the
chiefs question know that horace jackson owns any
more property here in town

  why yes replied the captain in a puzzled tone
he owns a small factory up on wyoming street next
to the p r r freight yards they used to make
novelty leather goods there but its been shut down
since the colonels death  

  yes i know interrupted the professor but is it
insured and if so how heavily

  huh demanded the captain for a moment he
stared at the professor who was placidly smoking the
cigar and gazing at the ceiling then he got up from
his swivel chair and started towards a huge metal filing
case on the other side of the room in a moment he
was back at his desk again with a bunch of papers

  there are two fire insurance policies on the place
he remarked glancing over one of the pages both are
in five figures

  for a moment the professor continued to smoke
and gaze at the ceiling presently he asked in a desul-
tory tone by the way captain did you hear about
the accident up at norcross street and th avenue
yesterday 

  uh-huh grunted the captain but lets stick to   
say whatinell you drivin at he demanded

well use your imagination replied professor clark
now suddenly alert and business like as he rapidly con-
tinued  now ill lay a wager that if theres any more
arson around here soon its going to be tonight or
tomorrow night believe me the person who engineered
that job at the keystone mill is clever-damnably
clever it was arson ati right as you suspected i
infra-calorescence



know that now and can prove how it was done before
any court also im morally certain who did it but if
we can catch this person red-handed so to speak it will
save a lot of time and miles of legal red tape this
person made a mighty smooth job of it the last time
and he knows it it worked so well that hell probably
try it again if he gets a good chance and now with
those two pieces of fire apparatus out of commission
for another forty-eight hours or so it would seem that
fate is playing right into his hands if he is the clever
plotter i think he is he wont pass up this opportunity
then the idea is to keep some of my men in and
around the place up on wyoming street for the next
few days  asked the captain as professor clark paused
to relight his cigar

  no they wouldnt find a thing or see a soul the
only good theyd do would be to turn in the alarm once
the fire did start replied clark

  but how is    

  what i want you to do interrupted the professor
is to get me an ordinary closed delivery truck you
can beg or borrow one some place in town if necessary
any small enclosed delivery truck will do

  but what the deuce has a closed delivery truck got
to do with catching criminals demanded the captain

  now get thissaid the professor the person who
started the fire in the keystone mill wasnt in the place
or around it when he did it not really close anyhow
the same will be true the next time if there is a fire
the person who perpetrates it wont be very close to
the building when it goes up in flames

  time clock on his infernal machine

  no there wont be any infernal machine in the
place any more than there was in the keystone mill
just get me this truck as soon as you can this morning
ill install in it some of my apparatus which i have al-
ready constructed then tonight you bring along three
of your plain-clothes men and well drive around in the
vicinity of this property on wyoming street if the
infernal machine as you call it is started my apparatus
will give its location and then well go there and get
the operator at his work of course if no attempt is
made to fire the place then well have to go about it in
the usual way but im rather confident that that wont
be necessary

  you think this fire-bug works by radio then we
drive around and if his fire broadcaster starts in we
get its location and go there and nab him grinned
captain anderson

  thats about  what it amounts to replied the
professor

  well i hope you know what youre about any-
how its worth a try so come on i think i know where
i can get a truck said the captain

  wait a second captain youd better give the chief
a ring and have him expect a call to that place tonight
or tomorrow night

  right i didnt think of that replied the captain
as he returned to the phone on his desk

the leather goods mill was a three-story frame
building some two hundred feet long and half as
wide it was in the middle of the block between th
and th avenues while on the other two sides of it
were the pennsylvania freight yards and wyoming
street across from it on wyoming street were small
shacks and frame buildings of the poorer class and

about half-way down the block was a small twenty-
four-hour-a-day greasy spoon restaurant that catered
to the men from the freight yards

  on both sides of the truck in weather-beaten letters
was painted smythe and son licensed plumbers
the driver in a dirty pair of overalls and a battered
hat was busily engaged in puffing on a corncob pipe
and piloting the truck beside him apparently half
asleep was another just as seedy looking individual in
a heavy sweater and greasy cap to any person who
might take the trouble to notice the outfit presented all
the appearance of smythe and son licensed plumbers
returning from a late emergency job but inside the
truck instead of pipe tools and such implements of the
plumbing fraternity there were three men in the back
end hunched against the doors were captain anderson
and one of his men in the front part directly behind
the driver sat professor clark who had on a pair of
ear-phones and was busily engaged in slowly turning two
dials on what appeared to be a small portable radio set
and direction finder but instead of the usual loop
aerial there was a very fine mesh wire screen built in
the form of a parabolic reflector inside the reflector
were two stiff copper wires each one about half an inch
long mounted end to end and separated by a small glass
insulator this arrangement was mounted much like
the regular loop aerial and could be pointed in any hori-
zontal or vertical direction

  for some time this strange outfit drove up and down
wyoming street and the intersecting avenues never go-
ing more than a few blocks from the leather goods mill
except a few men from the railroad yards entering or
leaving the greasy spoon on wyoming street nobody
was about

  looks like your suspicions aint so hot professor
drily grunted the captain scrooching around and trying
to find a more comfortable position in his cramped
quarters

  mebbe so replied the professor as he glanced at
his watch give em time its only a little after one
   theres hours yet

  huh snorted the captain about another hour
of this and ill be a cripple for life 

  as they were coming up th avenue towards wyo-
ming street a large moving van rumbled past them
turned up wyoming street and ground to a stop in
front of the restaurant as smythe and son passed
it two tough looking characters emerged from its cab
and leisurely made their way into the greasy spoon
after the delivery truck passed it the driver turned
around and gave the professor an inquiring look

  go on a block or so then turn around said the
professor

  a few minutes later they were again nearing the
restaurant just after they had slowly passed the parked
van a faint whistle came from the professors headset
and then just as suddenly it ceased

  go down to the end of the block then come back
and park in front of that van quickly whispered the
professor to the driver then to the captain theyre
at it now    must be using a directed beam as i
could only get it for the space of ten feet or so

  by this time they were down near the end of the mill
and once more that peculiar whistle came out of the
professors headset

  seems to be turned on this end of the place now
remarked the professor it either comes from the


amazing stories

place where the restaurant is or else from that big van
in front of it

  they turned around and once more started up the
street when they passed the lower end of the mill the
sound was again heard and as they neared the van
it again suddenly stopped as they passed the van and
pulled into the curb in front of it the professor removed
his earphones and turned to the captain

  lets go well see whats in that van first if
theres nobody there its into the restaurant for us
quickly the five men got out of the small delivery
truck and started towards the van inside the restau-
rant the two men who had left the van a few minutes
before could be seen at the bar busily engaged in eating
the waiter was at the far end of the room and had his
back turned to the door

  as the professor and the four detectives neared the
van a faint humming sound could be heard above the
idling throb of the motor

  its in the van whispered the professor sounds
like a motor-generator outfit

  the captain directed one of his men to go into the
restaurant to keep an eye on the two drivers of the van
and to arrest them as soon as they started to leave the
place then the others silently and quickly went around
to the back of the van the entire back end was made
up of a large double door and fastened by a heavy
spring latch with loops for a padlock but fortunately
no such padlock was in place reaching up the captain
grabbed the latch gave it a tug and quickly threw back
the two halves of the door

  just inside the door on one side of the van was a
dark skinned and heavily bearded person in the act of
rising from a small folding chair in front of him on
the other side was what appeared to be a compact but
exceedingly powerful short-wave transmitter in the
front part of the van was a large motor-generator set
busily humming away the whole interior was brightly
illuminated by a small globe in the ceiling

  up with em and get thaell outa there quick
rapped out the captain the tall haughty looking indi-
vidual so addressed stared for a second at the three
business-like automatics pointed at various parts of his
anatomy and then reluctantly started to get out of the
van

  put the bracelets on him quick cried the professor
as he jumped into the van and reached for a large knife
switch above the motor-generator set

  whats this little melodrama all about indignantly
demanded the prisoner cant a scientist carry out
some experiments with a portable radio set without  
save that for the judge snapped the captain
but i demand an explanation of this outrage youll
suffer for this blundering snarled the prisoner as the
handcuffs were deftly snapped on his wrists just what
do you expect to charge me with 

  that said the professor who had emerged from
the van and was now pointing towards the far corner
of the mill there behind the first floor windows was
a flickering rosy glow and already whisps of smoke were
seeping out around the windows and from between the
boards of the frame walls just then around the end of
the van muttering and cursing came the two previous
occupants of the restaurant with their hands above their
heads directly behind them was the other officer with
an automatic in each hand

  quick professor called the captain into that

restaurant and send in an alarm while we put these
babies in the van

  a moment later as the professor dashed out of the
restaurant the big van was already slowly starting off
he made a wild dash for it and leaped into the front
seat beside the officer who was driving

  everybody back there he puffed jerking his thumb
over his shoulder

  yeah grunted the officer captains probably
givin em the third degree already but we gotta get
out of this neighborhood fast    i know the way some
of those guys on the fire department drive and with this
old barn i wouldnt care to pass any of em

  the next morning the professor went down to cap-
tain andersons office in the city hall when he got
there the captain and the chief were engaged in deep
conversation

  well captain did you learn anything from your
prisoners of last night said professor clark after he
had carefully selected one of the captains cigars and
lighted it

  not a thing replied the captain but first you
had better hear what the chief has to say

  just this professor immediately began chief
elliot thanks to the tip you and the captain gave us
we got to last nights fire before it had too much of a
start and got it under control and stopped it after any
fire one of my men and myself always make a round
of inspection through the property of course in this
case i kept a sharp lookout for any of those little blue
spheres well we found some    and in the most sig-
nificant places for instance we found a handful in
a pile of old packing cases some more in a scrap heap
of paper and rags    and so on after the part that
had burned cooled off enough we picked around among
the charcoal and what-not and were lucky enough to
find a dozen or so more the chief paused as he
reached in his pocket and drew out a handful of the
peculiar little quartz spheres ive got a big box full
back at my office he added

  i knew theyd be found there said the professor
but id like to know what your prisoners had to say

  well growled the captain the two drivers of the
van said they didnt know a thing about it they owned
the van and did trucking and moving jobs late thurs-
day afternoon a stranger came into their office and
chartered their van for last night gave them their
instructions and paid them well he said he was a scien-
tist and that he wanted to carry on some experiments
with a portable radio the pay was good and they
didnt stop to ask questions about other peoples business
then when we got that far with our examination they
both started to holler for a lawyer

  the operator of the radio or whatever it was said
his name was schuman and that he was a scientist ex-
perimenting with short-wave portable radios and that
he didnt know a thing about the fire until you pointed
it out to him then he also started to bellow for a
lawyer

  all our bluff and third degree stuff didnt phase any
of the three a bit and they wouldnt say another thing
an hour or so ago i had the radio engineer from our
local half-pint broadcasting station over here to take
a look at the apparatus in the van and to tell us what
he thought it was he said hed take an oath that it
was only a short-wave radio transmitter of exceptionally
high power and that its radiations were no more capable
infra-calorescence



of starting a fire than are the radiations of any other
broadcasting station so there you are    

  huh i i wonder what correspondence school that
radio engineer authority of yours graduated from
snorted professor clark why anyone who is ac-
quainted with radio transmitters could see at a glance
that that oufit was far from an ordinary short-wave
transmitter anyhow thats beside the point at pres-
ent i wonder captain if you would let me have a
little private chat with the operator of this ordinary
short-wave transmitter i think i can inject a little
verbal stimulant that will greatly increase the vocal
prowess of your bearded law-breaker grinned profes-
sor clark

  the captain thoughtfully frowned for a moment and
then arose all right then come on

  quickly the three men made their way to the elevator
and thence to the basement where there was a cell block
for prisoners awaiting hearings a moment later the
captain unlocked the door of the cell in which the op-
erator of the strange radio set was temporarily board-
ing professor clark nonchalantly strolled in left the
door ajar and sat down on the three-legged stool the
captain and chief elliot took their stand farther down
the corridor where they could keep a sharp lookout
though they were not quite near enough to hear the
muttered conversation within the cell

  for half an hour the professor remained in the cell
the chief and captain anderson impatiently shifted
from one foot to the other and watched the prisoner
smoke professor clarks cigarettes as he talked finally
professor clark slowly rose and started for the door
as soon as he was out in the corridor the captain re-
locked the door and enquiringly turned to the professor

  get anything out of him he asked as they went
down the corridor to the elevator

  hes willing enough to talk now and tell you what
you want to know replied the professor but that
can wait but if you two gentlemen have an hour or
so to spare i wish youd come up to the high school
with me nobodys around saturday mornings so
well have the place to ourselves there i will give you
the explanation to this little mystery of yours    and
a practical demonstration

some fifteen minutes later the three men were as-
sembled in the physics laboratory of the senior high
school chief elliot and the captain each perched on
one of those high back-breaking laboratory stools were
expectantly watching the professor as he fumbled among
a bunch of papers in a desk drawer presently he found
what he wanted and tossed a sheaf of papers upon the
desk

  leaning back in his chair he announced theres a
complete written report of my findings in this case
which by the way were confirmed in every detail some
fifteen minutes ago by your prisoner who is none other
than horace jackson jr 

  huh exploded the captain is that young jack-
son i got back there in the jug

  none other the dark skin and the brush works were
temporarily assumed to fool anyone who might recog-
nize him and to befool any wary minions of the law
that he might accidentaly stumble across grinned pro-
fessor clark

  but prof how did you find that out  
  didnt i tell you that i got him to confess inter-

  rupted the professor calmly as he lighted a cigarette

  yeah but whats  

  now just wait a second and ill start from the begin-
ning said the professor

  it was probably just a lucky guess or maybe one
of those intuitive hunches you hear about that gave
me the key to this mystery when you gave me those
little spheres i noticed at once that they were of a blue
color crystalline quartz is white or rather colorless
like glass undoubtedly the blue color was due to the
carbon impurities was the quartz fused by the heat of
the fire so as to mix with the carbon from charcoal
hardly no suchfire could be hot enough to melt quartz
whats more this was in a crystalline form and not
fused besides crystals dont grow in spherical forms
hence they must have been mechanically ground to that
shape

  of course i was taking for granted for the time
being that these spheres did have something to do with
or were the cause of the fire these thoughts flashed
through my mind in the few seconds i was looking
at them then i suddenly remembered that any body
when cold absorbs the same waves that it will emit
when heated the spheres were blue therefore they
absorbed the shorter waves that was the idea that put
me on the right track it didnt explain the fire by any
means but it pointed out a line of investigation and ex-
periment to follow then in a hazy way i saw how it
might work out after a lot of experimenting i
found that my idea was right the professor paused
for a moment tossed his cigarette into a nearby sink and
then went on

  the thing as a whole is simple enough but the actual
tracing out of the process step by step each grounded
upon facts and proof that would hold before a court of
law was another matter entirely ill try to explain it
as briefly as i can but in order to show you how it is
possible ill have to digress into the realms of physics
for a bit

  to begin with we know that electric waves heat
light and so on are only waves or vibrations in the ether
and differing from each other only in wave-lengths or
size and in frequency or rate of vibration as the wave-
length is shortened the frequency becomes higher and
vice versa according to the simple formula

                                  

wave-length in meters -

                                 frequency in seconds
by the use of this formula we can arrange a long table
of etheric vibrations which you can think of as the
music for the keyboard on some huge piano

   way down at the bass end of the scale are those
huge electro-magnetic waves used for trans-oceanic
wireless communication these are anywhere from
about  to  meters long by the way a meter
equals aproximately  inches as we go up the
keyboard a little we come to those familiar waves used
in radio broadcasting and going down to about forty
meters in length next come those very short radio
waves that are being experimented with so much at
present these short radio or hertzian waves go from
about forty meters down to about one meter and less
continuing on up our keyboard we find shorter and
shorter hertzian waves the very shortest of these
have a length of about one-tenth of a millimeter now
go just a few notes higher until we come to waves
about  millimeters long here instead of radio


amazing stories

waves we have waves that we can perceive with our
senses in short heat waves these take up quite a
space on our keyboard and go from about  milli-
meters in length down to about  going just a
little higher up the scale we come to waves about 
millimeters long here another remarkable change takes
place the waves become visible to us as red light as
these get shorter we go through all the colors of the
spectrum until we reach the extreme of visibility in the
violet waves about  millimeters in length beyond
this the ultra-violet is next and so on you can readily
see by our formula that the frequencies of heat and light
waves are really tremendous so it will be easier to
speak of them in terms of wave-length rather than in
frequencies although it may make my explanation a bit
more involved

  now i must add a few words on the general struc-
ture of matter and its reaction to these etheric
waves take for instance a solid body it is made up
of an almost countless number of minute bodies called
molecules these molecules do not touch each other but
are held together at varying distances by the forces of
attraction and repulsion and hence are capable of vibra-
tion in crystalline substances they are arranged in cer-
tain definite geometrical patterns how rigidly these
forces hold them together depends in a very general way
upon the properties of the body and the condition it is
under such as heat or electrical influences

  these molecules in turn are built up of a relatively
small number of still smaller things called atoms the
atoms in each particular kind of molecule are arranged
in definite patterns somewhat analogous to the arrange-
ment of molecules in crystals they can also vibrate
within the molecule even as the molecule vibrates as a
whole within the solid now even the atoms are made
up of still smaller divisions some of these called elec-
trons and protons which are positive electrons are also
capable of vibration within the atom

  it is evident that the vibration of each molecule will
be slower and hence have a longer wave length than
that of the atoms within the molecules also that the
vibration of the electrons in the atom will be more rapid
than that of the atom as a whole in a very general way
when a substance is exposed to heat waves the molecules
vibrate integrally when still shorter heat waves are
applied the atoms vibrate within the molecules while the
molecules themselves are in vibration and as still shorter
waves such as light are applied the electrons vibrate
within the atoms

  any body capable of vibration has a fixed rate of
frequency what this frequency is depends upon a num-
ber of factors which i dont have to mention here this
fixed rate or frequency is called the fundamental when
a body is vibrating at its fundamental it is vibrating as a
whole now under certain conditions it may be vibrat-
ing at its fundamental and yet be divided into aliquot
parts which in turn are vibrating within the body re-
member how the atoms vibrate within the molecule while
the molecule itself is vibrating secondary vibrations
are called overtones or harmonics and their frequencies
bear a simple numerical relation to the frequency of the
fundamental for instance call the fundamental fre-
quency two the second harmonic the first really of
this would have a frequency of four the third eight
and so on these overtones also produce many other
frequencies amongst themselves due to interference and
beats also under certain conditions a very strong

harmonic may become the fundamental for still higher
harmonics in a general way the number of overtones
produced largely depends upon the strength or energy
in the fundamental

  now lets apply this to the structure of matter in our
solid body suppose a very strong and rather long
heat wave strikes this body that has the right properties
what happens     the molecules will vibrate integrally
at the fundamental frequency of the heat wave the
atoms within the molecules will vibrate at harmonic fre-
quencies to this and will produce more heat waves but
of a higher frequency if the fundamental is strong
enough the electrons within the atoms will vibrate at
still higher overtones and produce light this action
of changing heat waves into the shorter waves of visible
light is called calorescence

  now if you remember i said before that in crystals
the molecules are grouped into geometrical patterns
much like atoms are arranged to form molecules
it is quite obvious that even a small crystal is far too
large to vibrate as a whole to any heat wave but heres
the strange thing about it some crystals if carefully
ground to the correct size will vibrate when subjected
to radio waves this is a well-known fact and is being
made use of in the broadcasting stations the crystals
are used as frequency regulators to produce a steady
unwavering frequency

  suppose we have a crystal of this kind and cut it
down until its fundamental corresponds to a very short
wave length then expose this crystal to a very strong
radiation of the same frequency the crystal will then
vibrate as a whole to this frequency while the molecules
and atoms will vibrate to the higher overtones of the
fundamental the crystal will now be radiating heat
waves of many different frequencies in short we put
a radio wave into the crystal and got a whole flock of
heat waves out of it if the energy put into the crystal
is sufficient and the molecular and atomic structure is of
the right type the crystal will also emit light waves
then we have an incandescent body whose light and
heat is produced wholly by our radio wave the pro-
fessor paused for a moment to light another cigarette
and then went on

  quartz is one of those crystals i have just been talk-
ing about now here is where the real cleverness of
these crimes comes in ordinary quartz crystals would
never produce heat waves let alone incandescence when
acted upon by even an extremely powerful transmitter
at such distances as a few hundred feet the loss of
energy would be entirely too great for one thing the
crystal would only vibrate at its fundamental along with
the first few harmonics which would only give more
radio waves of a shorter length all the received energy
would be frittered away in these low harmonics and
there would be none left to activate the very high ones
that would produce the heat and incandescence the
simplest theoretical way to overcome this difficulty
would be to cut out the low and useless harmonics leav-
ing only the real high ones which are needed you can
readily see that in practice this would be an almost im-
possible undertaking but this is exactly what the
genius who committed your crimes did

  i carefully analyzed some of those little spheres and
as your report said found them to-be composed of quartz
with a slight percentage of carbon but a real careful
analysis proved that the carbon used was an isotopic
form hitherto unknown this isotope had an atomic
infra-calorescence



weight of exactly eleven while the regular carbon atom
has an atomic weight of  by adding a certain
percentage of this peculiar kind of carbon to the quartz
in some unknown way a crystal was produced that when
ground down to the right size would give a few very
high harmonics of great strength these in turn also
acted as the fundamentals for another group of over-
tones necessary to produce the incandescence by the
use of a very powerful transmitter with a narrow highly
directional beam enough energy was received by the
crystals within the buildings to produce the calculated
results    so there you are the rest is rather self-
explanatory now isnt it

  chief elliot and the captain incredulous amazement
written all over their faces sat there staring at the pro-
fessor

  sure listens all right prof    but id  

  like to see a demonstration interrupted the pro-
fessor well here it is arranged especially for you
gentlemen and for a court and jury if necessary he
said as he went across the room to a table full of ap-
paratus

  here is a duplicate of that transmitter that we found
in the van of course its a lot smaller and less power-
ful but for a short distance it works just as well by
the way the school board didnt pay for this apparatus
its some of my own that i fool around with for my own
amusement and edification he added with a laugh
then in a serious voice

  see those quartz spheres on the asbestos pad on the
table in front of you well keep an eye on them while
i turn on the power he threw a switch on the wall
above his apparatus a loud humming sound became
audible and two large vacuum tubes began to glow to
get a better look at what might happen the captain got
up from his stool and leaned over the table with his
back to the professor and his apparatus for a moment
nothing happened as the captain and the chief con-
tinued to stare at the little crystal spheres

wow exploded the captain suddenly becoming
erect and jumping aside a few steps as he put his hand
over his shoulder and felt his back what the   
whatsa matter  grunted chief elliot gotta bite 
bite hell retorted the captain

  just then a loud chuckle came from the other side of
the room the professor was standing beside his ap-
paratus and seemed to be enjoying the situation thor-

oughly finally his merriment subsided to a broad grin

   seems that animal tissue is even more sensitive to
these short waves than crystals laughed the professor
you see captain you were standing directly in the
path of the beams from my transmitter here and its
wave produced heat vibrations in your body much like
it would in the crystals i remember now reading that
when wgy and kdka were first experimenting with
ultra-short wave transmitters the bodies of the men
working about the transmitters would become warm and
after some time they would even get a fever explained
the professor

  huh nice thing to do to a fella grunted the cap-
tain still gingerly feeling his shoulder-blades

  look at those crystals now ejaculated the profes-
sor

  well ill be   announced chief elliot as he gazed
in fascination at a number of little balls of reddish-yellow
light on the asbestor pad he put out his hand and
slowly passed it through the air about a foot above the
glowing spheres thats hot enough to start any frame
building

  youd be too if you were sitting in front of that
infernal machine over there replied the captain still
nursing his back

  professor clark shut off the transmitter and came
back to the swivel chair behind his desk

  howdya get jackson to talk asked the captain
after a moments pause by just proving to him that
you knew his whole process

  no replied the professor as he lighted another
cigarette after i convinced him i knew how he had
done it he just laughed at me and dared me to take
such a story before any court and jury and make it
stick

  then what impatiently queried the captain

  oh i just casually mentioned a few modifications in
his process that might make it quite practical for the
transmission of power by radio then i added that he
was just a young man and that the pennsylvania laws
only give from one to five year sentences for burning to
defraud insurance companies that loosened him up
and we talked things over    simple enough wasat
it

  well ill be  s  offered the captain staring at
chief elliot

  ditto agreed chief elliot staring at the captain

the end

then began the greatest fight

arvon

by charles clou key

author of anachronism paradox etc

n the concluding chapters which seem peculiarly fitting to this type of
story our author introduces several clever and ingenious scientific problems
with attending possible solutions which might easily become a working basis
for some aspiring and imaginative embryo scientist since it is with the future
progress of science that we are here mostly concerned this serial will be found
exceedingly provocative of new ideas

illustrated by morey

what went before

the scientists of cor one of the two rival eity-nations of venu have
succeeded in exchanging identities across the void of space the
corians are planning to overrun the earth and the three corians
in the bodies of the dornn brothers of vienna deairing the people of the
world to wipe each other out so that the corians can conquer it e at
the point of leading the world into war in the year  the world
does not know of the alien intelligences the hordes of howard fu-zhse
dictator of united mongolia are preparing for a sudden attack which is
to precipitate  war of scientific horror decimating the earth and paving
the way for the corian conquest on venus cor is building three
gigantio space vessels to invade the earth the first is very nearly com-
pleted the corians are also faced with the necessity of destroying sarvon
the other venerian city-natlon which wants friendship with the earth and
is opposed to conquest to destroy sarvon the corian scientists have
developed a ray that eauses steel subjected to it to become more brittle and
fragile than glass a large airplane carrying a projector of this ray is on
its way to utterly collapse sarvon which like cor is one immense unified
structure of steel these two civilizations of venus are each a strange
anachronistic mixture of greatly advanced science and utter primitiveness

  harrison ives a scientist killed by the corians in terrestrial bodies had
left in intricate code the secret of atomio power the corians in the
bodies of the dornns intending to send this stolen eode to venus in a
small rocket were tricked the oode sent to venus is a meaningless fake
and the real cipher is in the bands of the greatest terrestrial cipher-expert
brad-henson ecclestone but be cannot solve it either

  united utilities a gigantic corporation had financed professor riceardo
di bargis plan to build a rocket to reach venos on the rocket besides
the professor and crew are benny jaoobs a television news-scout for a
world-wide hook-up of radio circuits  and burton boyd a detective
employed by robert huston acting president of uaited utilities to fight
the dornns the rocket has just landed on a plateau between sarvon and
cor it is discovered that terrestrials are killed immediately on direct
exposure to sunlight on venus they plan to leave the rocket only during
the venerian nights

  some of the earth-identities in corian bodies escaped death at the hands
ef the corians mainly because of meriden a giant sword-fighter of sarvon
among them are the real dornn brothers who are helping sarvon laura
ives sister of the dead scientist who had been imprisoned in cor and
lee chilton a daredevil flyer who with the giant warrior meriden was
flying to warn sarvon of the corians steel-fatigue ray their plane
crashed in impenetrable jangle they fought their way to the plateau and
are climbing the cliff which crosses it though partners ia this adventure
they are rivals for the hand of laura ives who in her venerian body is
called izanne she has escaped imprisonment in cor and is hiding aboard
the plane carrying the corian steel-fatigue ray projector

  eenedar a corian scientist is on earth in a terrestrial body carrying on
important investigations which he has refused to disclose to the corian
council of nine

robert huston acting president of
united utilities entered the study of brad-
henson ecclestone mathematician and ci-
pher-expert ecclestone was slumped for-
ward over a table asleep his hand clutched
a black notebook-the notebook that contained the secret
of intra-atomic power in cipher-the notebook he had
taken when he had substituted a cleverly done meaning-
less imitation for the real thing the meaningless imita-
tion that had been sent to venus huston shook the
man ecclestone awoke straightened up and looked at
the executive with bloodshot eyes

  you look doped brad whats happened

  i fell asleep ive been concentrating on this cipher
for seventy-two hours using drugs hoping to find the
solution so that america can manufacture atomic power
weapons otherwise we havent a chance against united
mongolia this war is coming sooner or later and a
delay of a few hours in the solution may be fatal to us
the job is hopeless bob hopeless

  hopeless

  yes its no form of cipher known its new and
subtle beyond words there are almost exactly ten thou-
sand characters in the notebook bob even taking the
very doubtful assumption that each of these characters
represents some letter in the clear-

  i dont follow you

  i mean that every letter in every group in the note-
book represents one letter of a word in the solution of




amazing stories

course every a in the code doesnt mean r in the so-
lution-if it were as simple as that id have had it long
ago-but the fourteen as in the first line represent
quite probably each a different letter obtainable by some
intricate mathematical process depending upon its po-
sition or the letter preceding it or on some other combi-
nation of circumstances

  even assuming that the code is not padded with mean-
ingless characters and that single characters represent
only single letters and not groups of letters or whole
words which assumptions are very doubtful it follows
by a simple mathematics that there are a number of pos-
sible interpretations equal to the ten-thousandth power of
twenty-six which may be approximately represented by
the figures  with  zeroes after them of that
unimaginable number of solutions one is correct

up the cliff

ee chilton saw a slender dark-eyed girl close
at his side she was stretching out a hand to take
his her eyes were tender lips parted and very red
her hand touched his and the world of reality broke in
on his dream light dazzled his eyes

  we were saved from the jaguars said meriden the
sarvonian

  how  asked lee remembering the snarling pack
one of the corians meteorockets burst above our
heads the explosion frightened the beasts in fact frag-
ments killed two of them and wounded me slightly we
were both unconscious there was a curious lack of
color or emotion in the giants voice

  how did you learn what it was

  i recovered long before you in the rocket which
was undoubtedly sent from earth was a parachute
which opened as the rocket exploded and floated down
the winds carried it about a half-mile from here and
it caught in the top of a tree i saw it from the top of
another tree as near as i could make out the parachute
supported a book

  the process sent from the earth the cipher that
only izanne can solve

  i thought so said the giant coolly some corians
came in planes and got it i could have reached it before
they arrived

  why didnt you meriden  the impersonal tone of
the warrior was getting on the earthmans nerves

  i could not leave you alone unconscious lest the
jaguars return after their fright had worn off i could
not carry you so far i started to but then i saw the
corian planes and knew i would not have time to reach
it  

  you should have left me now they will torture her
until she tells them how to read the code and they will
have another weapon with which to fight sarvon and the
earth you should have left me

  meriden turned away inadvertently lee had in-
sulted him meriden the sarvonian would never leave
a comrade in danger then the swordsman thought of
the earthgirl imprisoned in cor had he been wrong to
leave her there though he knew now that she was an
earthgirl laura ives he thought of her always as izanne
of the hot planet he turned to lee

  you were calling her name before you came back to
consciousness you love her earthman

  yes stated lee

  you know that i love her too

  yes stated lee he knew now why meriden was
cool he remembered that on venus suitors fought to
the death for the hand of a girl he remembered that
the swordsman of sarvon had killed all the other war-
riors who had dared make love to izanne

  only one of us can have her said meriden calmly
so i understand said lee chilton when would
you prefer to kill me-now or later

  i am puzzled said the giant with a frown i do
not think it would be honorable to kill you now you
have had only a few days experience with swords be-
sides we are comrades in this undertaking perhaps
you will withdraw your claim

  certainly not i love her

  i knew you were not a coward but-i would have
no chance fighting with earth-weapons would i

  lee thought of the orgies automatic he was accus-
tomed to handling on earth and smiled

  not at all he said

  and you could not oppose me with swords it is
very puzzling i do not wish to kill you dishonorably
but-

  suppose we take our quarrel to her and ask her to
choose between us that would leave bloodshed out of
it-

  the swordsman regarded lee closely the earthmans
point of view was interpreted differently by meridens
mind

  that would be the agreement of two cowards he
said coldly

  or two friends said lee chilton then as the sar-
vonian warrior did not reply at present it would do
neither of us any good to kill the other we have a com-
mon purpose-to warn sarvon and indirectly aid in sav-
ing the earth cannot we continue as comrades until
that is accomplished 

  yes said the sarvonian suddenly though i am
afraid that we will never accomplish it in time we must
surmount the mountain barrier and penetrate a hundred
miles of jungle to reach sarvon if we are fortunate we
can make a mile in five or six days and the ray-projec-
tor will be ready any minute to wipe out sarvon it is
hopeless the city of my fathers is doomed continued
the warrior moodily probably we shall not live to see
izanne again she may not live to see us any more in
our lives-

  we were wrong to leave her

  yes they will torture her until she explains the
code-yet at the time it was the best we could have
done it would have been suicide to remain and if things
had gone as we planned she would have been rescued by
sarvon before now xavian would have ordered the
attack at once before the corians could finish the pro-
jector let us push on toward the cliff

  the jungle was less swampy as they approached the
mountainous region but the undergrowth was no less
impenetrable after five days of hardship they reached
the base of the cliff and rested before starting the climb
they had spoken often but never about the girl who was
prisoner in cor

  then they started to scale the cliff if they could cross
the barrier in ten days thought lee it would take more
than two venus-years to penetrate the jungle to sarvon
the ray-projector of cor would be ready in a few days
the swordsman of sarvon



at the most mounted on a giant plane that could travel
from cor to sarvon in hours there was no hope that
they could warn sarvon in time yet a thousand feet
a day through the jungle was better than standing still
and waiting for death they pushed on after hours
of strenuous climbing they found a ledge where they
could rest night was falling again

chapter xxii
escape

  tell you again that even if i should desire to
reveal the contents of that book to you i could not
do so said laura ives to her inquisitors it
is true that my brother invented a complex mathematical
cipher but the writings in this book are not in that cipher
i am not able to tell you what you want to know she
added calmly and if i could i wouldnt

  the corian scientist who had been cross-examining
her matched her casual tone we will give you one
days time to reconsider tomorrow at this hour the
plane will leave for sarvon it will be dark when it
arrives at the city they will not see the projector of
the ray that will destroy the city they have no chance
if you disclose the secret of this book before the giant
plane leaves for sarvon we will give you your freedom
sarvon and the earth will be destroyed why not join
the conquerors  we will give you property and power
if on the other hand you should be so foolish as to defy
us our scientists will find means of learning what we
want to know-to put it very very bluntly we can tor-
ture it is not torture that kills but torture that makes
death a desired but unattainable release you have until
tomorrow at this time to reveal the scientific secret in
that notebook your noble brother who made the in-
vention would prefer that you disclose it rather than
be tortured would he not

  it was a corian who killed him said laura ives
tight-lipped could you give me the universe i would
not aid you

  perhaps you will change your mind before tomor-
row we must have this secret though it would be a
pity to torture one so beautiful

  it will be useless to torture me even if i wanted
to tell you what the notebook says i could not do it
the possibility that the girl might be telling the truth
did not occur to the corian you have until tomorrow
he repeated tomorrow we shall destroy sarvon
laura ives laughed

  in the middle of the night she rose from her couch
and moved silently toward the barred door of her cell
there were guards in the corridor outside but so silently
did she move that they were not disturbed the one to
the left of the doorway was asleep his negligence had
been observed by the girl several nights previously fif-
teen paces to the right of the cell door was another a
giant warrior standing motionless and alert so much
could the girl see from behind the barred door of the cell
she grasped one of the steel bars in her slender hand
braced herself and pulled

  when the earth-identity laura ives had been trans-
ferred to the venerian body of izanne she had gained
supernormal strength as had the venus-girl who had
taken her body on earth and had slain her brother the
heavy steel bar bent as she strained at it three minutes

of effort-effort that drenched her with sweat and she
had torn the bar out of its steel sockets the noise
awakened the nearer guide but before he could gather
his senses the girl had swung the heavy bar on his skull
and stepped out through the gap -the warrior to the
right of the doorway ran up in a second followed by
those beyond him in the corridor the girl raised the
bar above her head and flung it at the feet of her nearest
pursuer it struck across his ankles breaking them both
he went down and the one nearest behind him fell over
his body as she ran a strange exultation seized her
giving wings to her feet and redoubling her already su-
perhuman strength in two seconds she saw her way
blocked by another guard lifting his sword to throw she
had carefully planned her escape and in the fraction of
a split second she acted

  she leaped completely over the astonished guard but
quick of mind and muscle the warrior turned in an in-
stant and hurled a gleaming weapon after the fleeing
izanne it all but missed her yet cut a sharp clean
wound in her shoulder as it hurtled by painful but
not serious and it left a trail of blood drops behind

  before any of the outwitted guards could follow
laura ives had reached a junction of two corridors had
turned into a transverse passage in five minutes she
had outwitted and outrun the warriors and had gained
the traffic corridors here feeling herself momentarily
safe she had paused to gain breath and she first noticed
the wound few corians were abroad at this hour yet
occasionally a citizen passed without giving her more
than a casual glance conscious now of the throbbing
pain she made her way toward the upper levels walking
laboriously up the long ramps

  after half an hour of fruitless search the guards had
found the blood trail an alarm was broadcast to all
cor slowly the guards followed the trail of blood-
drops but they were few and far between by dawn the
entire city was on the watch and the trail had been fol-
lowed all the way to the topmost level here the search-
ers lost the trail it was suggested that the girl might
have managed to elude the guards and steal a plane yet
every sky boat was in its place and the guards of the
upper level denied the possibility of anyone eluding them
and reaching a plane

  she could not have left cor therefore she was still
in the city said the officials but unfortunately they
could not find her sooner or later they assured the
council she would be discovered it was only a matter
of time if the council would be patient

  late that afternoon the ten-ton warplane carrying the
projector of the steel fatigue ray left the city the scien-
tist in command expected to reach sarvon after dark and
finish the work of destruction before daybreak sarvon
would be out of the way and the city of cor would feel
safe in sending its picked warriors to the earth in the
first completed space-ship it was three days before the
inferior conjunction of the earth and venus

  laura ives was aboard that plane wedged in the nar-
row triangular space between three cylindrical fuel-tanks
she had contrived to bandage her wound with a strip
torn from her tunic-like dress and she had slipped by
the half-asleep guard at the planes hangar opened the
unlocked door of the plane with the greatest caution
and had selected her hiding place

  she had not been able to provide herself with a
weapon

light and death

burton bo yd floated down from the ceiling of
his stateroom in the interplanetarian as riccardo
di bargi pushed open the door and floated in
spacesick mr boyd

  no professor i got over that a long time ago
though i never can get completely used to this weightless
condition how about the stowaway 

  most peculiar case the man was in rather poor
physical condition and the spacesickness hit him much
harder than it hit any of the crew we found him rav-
ing incoherently and ill swear that he was speaking
some foreign language though i dont know what one
im not such a bad linguist myself professor but i
never heard anything like that gibberish of his one of
the crew just told me that he regained consciousness and
tried to kill you

  he did the professor half smiled as he relaxed
comfortably near the ceiling i had taken the precau-
tion of unloading the gun he had with him the mus-
cular effort of drawing it and pulling the trigger was
enough to confuse the mans balance again he wasnt
used to weightlessness and had another fit of spacesick-
ness hes tied in a bunk now i believe he intended to
kill us all and capture the rocket demented i guess
hes quite evidently cursing us roundly now though we
cant understand any of it

  benny jacobs entered the room swimming awkwardly
through the air aiding himself more efficiently when he
happened to come in contact with a wall

  what news benny 

  not much mr boyd weve had to completely re-
build the television unit the sudden acceleration shat-
tered it terribly and its deuced awkward to do electrical
repairs without gravity ive been dodging hot drops of
solder for what seems like eternity they float around
the room in the most annoying manner and burn like
hell when they touch you its so hot in this rocket now
that the solder stays molten for a long time you see the
technical fellows in the news-gang are spending every
minute in repairing the unit as well as they can but even
the most modern televisors are complicated and delicate
things the announcer and i have been trying to make
ourselves useful by taking any little discarded box or
any other container we can find in one hand and a lid
in the other hand and floating around the room trying to
capture some of the stray solder itll never be my fav-
orite indoor sport mr boyd but joe that announcer of
ours has developed quite a technique at it hes got to
the point where he corners some solder almost as often
as some solder corners him

  how long do you think it will be before your gang
can establish communication with the earth 

  thats been worrying me universal news and all
the people it serves are depending on news-unit thir-
teen to give them the radio and television news and were
falling down on the job the world must think were all
dead if we work steady we might finish in sixty hours
mr boyd i hate to fall down on the biggest scoop in
the history of radio news-service

  in sixty hours said di bargi we shall have arrived
on venus

  yes

  yes youll begin to feel her gravitational influence
very soon youll probably be sick again as weight re-
turns but it will make your work easier i should have
taken more precautions to protect our cosmic radio are
you repairing the receiving apparatus

  were concentrating now on the transmitter and the
televisor professor we want to have at least voice and
maybevoice and vision when we arrive i bet the main
office is swearing at us now for not sending any news
through but i couldnt help it

  benny wiped his forehead with a handkerchief already
so wet that it would have dripped if the conditions of
gravity had been favorable to dripping and managed to
leave the room audibly wishing that he had a propeller
and rudder attached

  boyd recaptured a notebook that had floated out of
his pocket where are you going to land on venus
he asked curiously have you any plan

  i have when i photomapped venus a few years
ago with the hypertelescope i located two immense cen-
ters of activity-cities we may as well call them though
each is enormously larger than any terrestrial city-even
new york during the limited time i was able to ob-
serve them before the temporarily removed cloud-blanket
of the planet returned to stay i saw and photographed
airplanes moving from one to the other each one is
surroqnded by jungle they are some two hundred miles
or so apart and there is an enormous mountain barrier
between them with a plateau that as far as i can tell
from the photographs would be an ideal landing place
for the rocket it could not land in the thick jungles
and i dont think it advisable to try to land too near
either of the cities even if that were feasible

  you intend to land on the plateau

  i think it the best plan i can easily calculate its lo-
cation from the maps and the accurate chronometers on
board the rocket we can drop through the clouds con-
fident that we will land on the plateau not in the
jungles

  weve made exceptionally good time havent we
yes about  miles more or less in one
full month for a short time about the fifteenth day
we were making almost  miles per hour and from
that point i slowly decelerated at present we are
moving slowly not more than a mile a second and as
soon as we begin to notice the gravity of venus i shall
slow down to  miles an hour the negative accelera-
tion plus the venus-gravity will give you back your
weight rather suddenly

  will you slow down as violently as you speeded up
when you left the earth 

  no it wont be necessary the radio apparatus will
not be wrecked this time

  if it is benny will go crazy

  i dont doubt it

  it was sixty hours later almost to the minute when
the inter planetarian came to a cautious landing on the
plateau just below a thin layer of cloud it was late in
the day when the rockets enormous propellers ceased to
beat the foreign atmosphere from the thick windows
of the observatory the rocky mountain top barren and
rough was eagerly surveyed by the interplanetary pio-
neers the sun could be dimly seen through the clouds
yet because the planet was so much nearer to the sun
than the earth was there was none of the depressing
gloominess that characterizes cloudy days on earth even
the swordsman of sarvon



when the cloud blanket is thickest the sunlight brilliant
though diffused eliminates the hot planet intensely

  sotne of the atmosphere was taken into a test chamber
after a short wait the bespectacled chemist of the party
proclaimed it breathable though it contained a greater
percentage of carbon dioxide than had been expected or
detected from earth and in spite of the profusion of
plant life to take in the dioxide and liberate oxygen the
percentage of the latter was a trifle smaller than on earth
the order to unseal the door a process requiring some
ten minutes of work was given

  no one can blame john carton very much for his am-
bition  he paid dearly enough for it

  carton was a member of the crew since the rocket
left the earth he had cherished a secret plan-to be the
very first earthman to set foot on an alien planet while
the chemist was testing the air carton was unsealing
the door unknown to di bargi all except carton were
in the chemists laboratory or the near by rooms carton
was alone in the main storeroom to which the outer door
gave access with an oxyhydrogen blowpipe carton cut
away the seal of alloy that made the rocket truly air-
tight after the seal was cut he swung back the cir-
cular door on its massive hinges and stepped out into the
sunlight

  after the air-analysis was finished they found john
carton moaning with pain on the ground just outside
the door

  burton boyd leaped forward to pick up the sufferer
yet before the detective reached the door on his errand
of mercy he felt hard fingers grasping his shoulder
with a strength remarkable for a middle-aged scientist
professor di bargi hurled the detective back if you
value your life stay inside

  wondering comprehension dawned in the mind of the
chemist

  actinic rays he gasped and darted out the door
working as fast as was humanly possible he half lifted
half dragged carton into the rocket di bargi pushed
the balanced door shut

  why could he go out if i couldnt asked boyd of
di bargi who was busy directing the chemist to place
carton on a bunk di bargi replied over his shoulder

  you mean the chemist he took an awful chance
but at least he was wearing glasses

  the chemist appeared with a hypodermic and carton
was drugged to relieve his pain the distorted face re-
laxed and boyd saw that the mans eyes were literally
burned out boyd and the others turned away leaving
the chemist and the doctor and di bargi alone with the
patient the chemist emerged from the room twenty
minutes later boyd questioned him

  what happened to the man

  he was exposed to the direct sunlight too long

  not more than seven or eight minutes 

  too long the sun sends out light rays of all wave-
lengths above visible light are the ultra-violet waves
vital to life and above them are other invisible light-rays
that are extremely destructive these do not penetrate
the earths atmosphere but venus is so near the sun
that even its thick cloud blanket cant keep out the actinic
rays actinic light means light not necessarily visible
light that has power to produce or cause chemical
changes i never dreamed it could be so terrible on
venus when he stepped into the glare of the sun
even though the clouds diffused the light somewhat it got

his eyes right away caused them to oxidize-burnt
them out he stumbled and fell with the pain-blind
poor devil and exposed his whole body to them until i
got him in clothes are not much protection i took
a chance my eyes were protected by these goggles i
wear-the glass is opaque to the rays were safe inside
the rocket but if we ever go out it will be at night
cartons body was burnt too a few more minutes
would have been fatal i didnt expose mine very long
and ill tell the world i didnt look at the sun

  could anything live on the planet

  probably a matter of acclimatization they would
have to have bodies sufficiently different from ours to
resist the effects of the unfiltered sunlight ordinary
light doesnt hurt us yet it might quite conceivably kill
a being who had lived all his life in a place where there
was absolutely no light we could probably live here if
our skins were tough enough and a few other little
details of our anatomy were changed even on earth
some people tan readily and others are painfully and
even seriously burnt from imprudent exposure to the
sun its a matter of degree

  the doctors came out with the news that john car-
ton was dead

           chapter xxiv
           victim of fate

howard fu-zhse the second though he was
far too proud to show it outwardly was very
much afraid an intelligent boy of sixteen he
knew that america was holding him as hostage because
america was desperate america knew it could not hope
to withstand the onslaught of the yellow hordes for a
century america had known it fu-zhse the younger
knew it too he hated america because it was keeping
him prisoner of course they were treating him well as
well as a prisoner could be treated but he could not com-
municate with anyone he did not know where he was
as a matter of fact he was in a building in a small town
in kansas a building that looked perfectly innocent

  the boy often wondered if the americans would really
carry out their threat of death if his father attacked the
country they were afraid of his father these ameri-
cans would they dare really to kill a helpless boy
certainly they were very worthless and cowardly people
if they would kill a boy musing and trembling a little
howard fu-zhse ii turned over in his bed snapped out
the light of his soundproof cell and fell into a restlesd
slumber

  lee chilton was wanted by the police for jail-break-
ing at least so said the notices and so said the tele-
vision announcers of course the real personality lee
chilton was on venus in a venus body the corian
possessing his body had broken out of his cell at fort
severn quite easily and after a month was still at large
a very dangerous man said the police and they were
right if they had known just how dangerous this indi-
vidual was everyone in america would have been doing
nothing else except searching for him

  it was he who discovered the place where the boy-
hostage was concealed with stolen phosgen he gassed
the house before the guards were aware of trouble
masked he entered the house perhaps he knew that


amazing stories

he was throwing his life away perhaps he thought he
had a chance to live the gas-detectors in the house
sounded alarms at army camp  just outside the
town and in seconds motorized troops were on their way
to the house the plain-clothes guards in the house
masking themselves as soon as the detector gave the
alarm soon found that each of their masks was defective
the alien brain had managed to bring that about also by
a clever interception and exchange of packages when the
new masks were being sent to the house he had planned
his course of action very carefully

  in the seconds before the troops arrived he took the
keys from the dying guards entered the cell and stabbed
the boy to be sure of his death he did not take the
chance that his victim might survive the troops caught
him and killed him while the knife was still in his hands
there was a gun in his pocket they found later yet he
had killed the sleeping scion of fu-zhse with a knife
they also found the stolen canisters each with its little
red label carbonyl chlorid but it did them
no good the boy was dead as soon as fu-zhse heard
about his death all restraint would vanish the dictator
of united mongolia would strike to revenge america
would be erased all this and more ran through the
mind of the commanding officer yet he was human he
looked down at the bleeding body of the pitiful yellow-
skinned boy and turned away

  im sorry for the kid the little chink got a tough
break and he proceeded to report the matter to wash-
ington probably knowing quite well he was to be court-
martialed the problem of guarding the boy and yet
keeping secret his whereabouts had been delegated to
him and he had failed

  one should not fail if the life of a nation depends
upon success

  there was another who reported to superiors a spy in
camp  and the three in vienna were roused from
their slumber to learn that the hostage was dead they
looked at the harmless-appearing cable containing the
code-word they had agreed upon and smiled then they
put through a call to pekin where the dictator was in
retirement the three corians at vienna waited im-
patiently for the connection this time there could be
no further delay the first step of the venerian plan to
wipe out the terrestrial population was under way
fu-zhse held the power to eliminate america and eu-
rope would soon join against the western hemisphere
the three from venus knew that they were still in
political control of europe

  howard fu-zhse answered the radiophone call
brad-henson ecclestone opened the door of his apart-
ment to admit the commanding general of the new york
defense region the general wasted no words
have you solved the cipher

  no have any of your staff solved it

  no i guess this is the end the boy was killed an
hour ago our last chance to hold back fu-zhse is
gone now that the boy is gone he will attack immedi-
ately

  we could not hope to withstand mongolia without
atomic power could we

  i doubt it and fu-zhse will show no mercy now
it will be war and were on the losing side

  im sorry that cipher eludes me

  it cant be helped we know youve been trying to
solve it if it contains what we think it does we could

put up a real fight you do not see any hope for us

  ive made no progress except to eliminate certain
possibilities

  too bad well make what preparations we can for
defence

  at that second the dictator of united mongolia was
making preparations for offence his chief of staff
told him that it would take precisely forty-two hours to
wipe out america if they could attack by surprise the
air fleet made ready there would be no recall this time
the americans were to be annihilated before they could
resist through the mongolian army circulated the
story that america had deliberately killed the son of the
dictator after guaranteeing that he would not be harmed
if peace continued the americans had broken their
word they were to be destroyed

a flyer and a fighter

i ee chilton and meriden the sarvonian
swordsman scaled the rocky ascent and found the
interplanetarian just about the time benny jacobs
gang finished repairing their instruments

  the two were admitted by burton boyd and riccardo
di bargi each of whom held a pistol at the ready then
came the surprise of lees english and during the next
two hours the whole story of the plans of cor was un-
folded

  benny jacobs completed the interplanetary radiovision
circuit again the announcer spoke into his mike but
not for long he relinquished it to lee chilton and bur-
ton boyd

  the people of the earth served by the millions of
news machines under the control of universal news and
the great eurasian syndicate learned from across space
that it was venus that was responsible for the impend-
ing war on earth the secret agents of cor had played
the earth-nations against each other had worked up
festering hate

  the earths reaction was instantaneous the intelli-
gent people of both hemispheres had not wished for war
because war was no longer hell it was infinitely worse
than any hell

  almost on the second when fu-zhse was to order the
start of hostilities his grip was broken the greatest
mob-psychologlst since napoleon was fu-zhse hun-
dreds of thousands of men had been willing to meet cer-
tain death for him but the interplanetary circuit of
benny jacobs broke his power his own soldiers killed
him and sued for genuine peace the three in vienna
were destroyed almost as  soon as lee chilton and bur-
ton boyd told the earth of their identity and their plans
the people of the world released from the impending
threat of war established peace and friendship based on
mutual understanding each race realized that the
others were human like themselves they immediately
got together and made plans to resist the possible future
arrival of corians the fighting power of the earth as
one unified defense system was terrific and the earth
knew it white man and yellow man and black man
were no longer afraid of each other and together they
decided that they werent afraid of venus either let
the corians come if they dared the splendid war-
machines of the earth were ready and waiting  not

to destroy the peoples of the earth but to defend them

  two hours after the news-circuit was established the
announcer took his mike again the technician checked
his careful adjustments

  ladies and gentlemen of the earth you have just
been seeing and hearing the earthman lee chilton in a
venus body and burton boyd of the inter planetarian
this is news-unit thirteen which will be in constant
communication with the earth from now on as soon
as arrangements are perfected we will show you the
landscapes of venus at present we will turn the mike
over to professor di bargi who will talk for a short
time on the scientific aspects of our trip even here on
venus universal news is serving the world with popu-
lar and technical news  

every word that issued from the interplanetarian
was intercepted in the city of cor the council
of nme gave way to futile rage and hate no hope to
conquer the world now that it was warned and pre-
pared what to do the plane with the fatigue-ray
projector was on its way to sarvon in desperation the
spokesman of the council ordered his radio-operator to
get in touch with the giant war-plane they could at
least take some revenge this rocket from the earth
was steel too and steel they could destroy  of course
it would delay their destruction of sarvon a little but
not for long the hated steel city of their enemies would
come next

  a messenger entered a cosmic radiogram has just
been received from the earth the scientist eenedar
wishes to be retransferred immediately to his own body
it is now very dangerous on earth for any venus iden-
tity eenedar has made some very important discoveries
about the earth which he will report when he is returned
to his own body here on venus

  tell the scientists in charge to effect his return im-
mediately snapped the spokesman

the swordsman of sarvon fidgeted uneasily in the
rocket while chilton was discoursing over the radio
meriden knew that the earth must be warned but he
was also anxious for the safety of sarvon chilton had
translated the welcome of the earthmen to him and had
then of necessity left the giant to his own resources
shortly after the radio news-unit was through with lee
meriden in tremendous agitation called him pointing
out the open door of the rocket the sun was almost
setting but there was light to spare in the distance
they saw an immense war-plane crossing the plateau a
scant three hundred feet above it and they recognized
the plane for what it was  the carrier of the ray that
made steel more fragile than glass it was half way to
sarvon it would reach the city after dark and the
city would collapse and carry its inhabitants down to
death unless    unless they could prevent the plane
from reaching sarvon sarvon was not warned even
if it had been it had no way of protecting itself from
the ray sarvon was built of steel

  in a few seconds lee chilton had outlined the situa-
tion to boyd who gave swift orders one of the tiny
two-seated planes was brought from the cargo-room in
pieces which were rapidly uncrated the sun was still
low in the sky none of those in the rocket except lee
and meriden could dare to venture outside but lee chil-
ton knew terrestrial airplanes with the giants help he

carried the uncrated units outside and set to work as-
sembling them inside the rocket the highly-trained
crew eager to assist assembled the motor on a testing
block they had brought along checked every adjustment
tuned it up to perfection plus and meriden of sarvon
walked into the rocket picked up the efficient power unit
that three terrestrials could hardly have moved and
calmly carried it out to the almost assembled plane
when they were done and ready to take the air the sun
was yet lower in the cloudy sky in an hour or so it
would be dark

  lee waved to the watching crew and gave the ship
the gun it disappeared in the clouds almost imme-
diately in the direction that the feared plane from cor
had taken

  you see said the bespectacled chemist to burton
boyd that the venerians are immune to their destruc-
tive sunlight-a matter of acclimatization through the
centuries

  boyd hardly heard him a flyer and a fighter
mused the detective i wish i were with them

  a fierce exultation gripped lee chilton he was again
flying an earth-plane a sleek little hawk with fangs
delicate directional sound-detectors enabled him to locate
and follow the enormous corian plane in spite of the
fog the indicators told him that fie was gaining on
it ever so slightly he opened the throttle to its ulti-
mate the propeller seemed to bite into the fog he was
gaining on the monster now but it was still twenty miles
ahead and making almost as good time as he was could
he catch it before its batteries and generators and pro-
jectors flashed that disintegrating ray on the helpless
structure of sarvon he looked at his indicators again
and asked meriden some questions about the relative
location of sarvon yes if nothing went wrong he
could catch the corian plane

  concisely he instructed meriden in the use of the
guns the sarvonian was quick to learn but he had
never handled any bullet-projecting weapon in his life
lee explained how to use the automatically self-correct-
ing sights how to start and stop the deadly hail of ex-
plosive bullets from the marvite machine-guns two
were concealed in each wing-tip others were mounted
on the rim of the cockpit controlled by hand lee re-
gretted that he himself could not take over the guns
but he knew that he would have his hands full handling
the plane it would take some clever stunting to dodge
that beam of invisible rays if it once touched the plane
said plane would fall to pieces right out from under
them lee only hoped that the corians would send a
visible light-beam along with the other if they did it
would be perhaps a little easier for them to aim at the
terrestrial ship and it would also be easier for lee to
dodge he fingered his parachute to reassure himself
and instructed meriden concerning his   needlessly for
the giant was fully aware of the functions of a para-
chute

  the indicator needless of the sound-detecting appara-
tus suddenly jumped lee had not altered his course
and he was already making his maximum speed there
was only one explanation the other plane had altered
its course it took lee about thirty seconds to discover
definitely that the warplane was doubling back on its
course he warned meriden to be ready for immediate
combat the needles were approaching the limits of the
dials the other plane was getting close then the direc-


amazing stories

tional apparatus showed the earthman that the return-
ing monster was not coming exactly towards him per-
haps was not even aware of his existence it was going
toward the rocket

  the sun was just setting the fog was getting darker
gray blindly lee altered his own course to intercept
the corian plane in a few minutes he thought he saw
it dimly through the foggy mist a short burst of bul-
lets from one of meridens guns exploded against the
armored side of the warskyship from cor beginners
luck it was several minutes before any of meridens
other attempts were successful yet he was doing his
best to make his shots count to wreck his enemys plane
to save sarvon meridens first burst had injured the
big plane only slightly if it had hit the tail or wing-
surfaces things would have gone differently it inflicted
only minor injury on the armor that guarded the vital
parts of the ray-generator

  but meridens shots came close and the corians soon
began to realize that they were coming closer with every
second the unwieldy corian ship could neither out-
distance nor outmaneuver the terrestrial hawk

  only at intervals was either plane visible from the
other lee flew with seeming recklessness and with in-
comparable skill darting up to give meriden a chance
with the guns flashing out of sight literally flying circles
about the other meriden succeeded in getting in another
direct hit that jarred the corians but did not wound
the big ship it held steadily on its course to the rocket
they were close to it now

  a brilliant beam of light shot out from the corian
plane seeking the small attacker it seemed to be man-
ipulated with incredible speed by some skilled operator
a burst of bullets from the grim giant in the front cock-
pit went wild meriden cursed his luck for neither he
nor the cool chilton knew as they tried their level best
to bring down the armored war-plane of the unconscious
stowaway wedged between three fuel-tanks meridens
first burst had jarred the plane and the dark-eyed girl
had struck her head against one of the tanks and had
slumped down between them she was momentarily safe
from discovery yet if one steel-jacketed explosive bullet
had penetrated one of those tanks   

  lee banked suddenly to avoid that disturbingly quick
shifty brilliant beam of light and circled around to give
meriden another direct aim the beam beat him to it
framed the little plane in brilliance for one second noth-
ing happened evidently the steel-fatigue ray was not
being projected along with the searchlight a continu-
ous stream of bullets was flashing from one of meri-
dens guns    somehow he had jammed a trigger lee
swung around again toward the weirl beam of light that
pierced the blackness that stream of bullets shouldnt
be wasted apparently meriden couldnt stop the gun
as he swung into an advantageous position the supply
of cartridges gave out lee cursed from exasperation
yet that circumstance had saved izannes life at least
for a while lee chilton didnt know that she was
aboard the enemy ship   

  the great searchlight beam was pointing downward
now suddenly lee got a glimpse of the immense inter-
planetarian plainly revealed in spite of the fog outlined
by the penetrating light the character of the light
changed an unpleasant metallic bluish tinge imbued it
now and the great steel rocket suddenly collapsed the
steel had been rendered more brittle than glass by arti-

ficially produced steel-fatigue a thousand times more
severe than the natural weakness that very rarely occurs
in steel structures after long use the weakness called
metal-fatigue for lack of a better name or a better ex-
planation sometimes it seems as if the steel had just
grown tired the master scientists of cor had learned
to produce that same phenomenon many thousand times
as complete their ray destroyed not the steel but the
cohesion between the molecules of steel so it crumbled
like dust

  lee chilton saw red he was no longer a cool dare-
devil trying scientifically to obtain advantageous posi-
tions for meridens guns he was a madman determined
to revenge the destruction of the rocket he flashed
through the fog within fifteen feet of the other plane
meridens guns were continuously going staccato and it
was having some effect on the big plane one wing was
damaged  

  the searchlight found the little comet again and this
time it had that alien bluish tinge the earthplane flew
to pieces just as an explosion rocked the corian plane
lee pulled the ripcord of his parachute as he had planned
to do in case of emergency devoutly hoping that meri-
den had remembered to pull his as per instructions
meriden had kept his nerve however and lee saw
dimly another billowing white mass close by the two
men were falling in almost the same path before he
expected it lee was bruised by sudden contact with
hard rock meriden was close and the earthman rea-
lized that they had landed on the plateau perhaps they
could join the rocket-crew if any had escaped alive when
the space ship had disintegrated di bargi and boyd
would be desperate the venus-day would come again
before many hours and to terrestrials not actually pos-
sessing venerian bodies sunlight meant death    they
had no shelter

  meriden gripped his hand their comradeship had
grown deeper during that battle

  at the very last queried the giant you heard the
explosion 

  yes your last shots must have been effective it
sounded like one of their fuel-tanks exploding they
probably crashed somewhere below the plateau in the
jungle i saw a sheet of flame surround their plane

  i am sorry about your friends earthman but they
will know the gratitude of sarvon for that plane they
gave us at least we have saved my city from the
corian ray

  but meriden the sarvonian and lee chilton of the
earth were too blindly optimistic to be sure some fuel-
tanks had exploded some of the corian crew had been
killed yet the giant plane had not crashed it was a
warplane built for battle built to withstand damage
there was enough fuel left and the ray-projector was
unharmed it was limping toward sarvon and aboard
it was a bleeding girl

the cosmic balance

 t eenedar can wipe out the population of the

i  earth in three days said the corian meteorologist
to the council of nine it is indeed fortunate
that your plan of warfare was not successful for war-
fare would have wrecked and destroyed the great build-
ings and the great works of the earth damaged that
the swordsman of sarvon



which we wished to conquer when my plan is put
into execution none of the earth-structures will be de-
stroyed we can take possession of the untold wealth of
the planet at once furthermore my plan is safe it
cannot fail

  the nerves of the spokesman were on edge what
iis your plan  he snapped tell us at once the other
councillors leaned forward tensely surely eenedar
would not speak so confidently if he were not sure of
himself he had been to the earth in an alien body to
investigate conditions there he was known as a great
and reliable scientist so certainly his plan was worth
hearing

  human life on the earth eenedar commenced
has developed for ages under a very delicate cosmic
balance a very exceptional corrfbination of circum-
stances the skins of terrestrials are very thin and deli-
cate in comparison to those of venerians and their
tissues are also more delicate in composition we on this
planet are accustomed to an intensity of sunlight even in
spite of the clouds that terrestrials could not endure
certain actinic rays which have only a beneficial effect
upon us would be deadly to terrestrials these rays are
always present in sunlight but they do not reach the
terrestrials because of a peculiar circumstance-the pres-
ence of a small percentage of ozone in the upper atmos-
phere of the earth this ozone acts as a filter straining
out or eliminating the rays harmful to terrestrial life
it is a very delicate balance if there were more ozone
in the earths atmosphere it would filter out the ultra-
violet rays which are essential for life to exist and if
there were a little less ozone in the atmosphere it would
fail to screen out the destructive actinic rays of the sun
by increasing or decreasing the ozone content of the
earths atmosphere we can insure the death of every ter-
restrial it will be easier and quicker and more sure to
destroy all ozone in the earths atmosphere rather than
try to add some in three days the earth will be cleared
of inhabitants we can take possession forever of the
undamaged rich planet and i assure you i have seen
some of its incredible wealth our bodies are used to
the rays which will destroy the terrestrials   

  just how do you propose to bring this about

  it is very simple ozone is nothing more or less
than a variant or allotropic form of oxygen an ordi-
nary molecule of oxygen consists of two oxygen atoms
a molecule of ozone is made up of three oxygen atoms
oxygen is the more normal or stable form oxygen
atoms under most circumstances tend to pair off in
twos forming oxygen molecules rather than combining
in threes to form ozone molecules all that we need is
a device to cause ozone molecules to split up dissociate
and then they will naturally recombine to form mere
oxygen which does not have the ability to shield from
the particular rays of the sun which are destructive to
earthmen

  but how can we change the earths ozone to ordinary
oxygen 

  i perceive that the council has not been kept well
informed when our scientists were developing the
steel-destroying ray which was so successful in destroy-
ing the terrestrial rocket as has just been reported by
radio the ray which is soon to destroy sarvon forever
their first successful step was the production of a ray
that would break the valence of gases causing gaseous
molecules to dissociate into gaseous atoms that ray is

in use even now in our electrical factories and shops
electrical machinery often generates quantities of ozone
its odor is pungent and disagreeable so even now in
cor we are using this ray to destroy ozone freed from
the influence of the ray the dissociated oxygen atoms
recombine to form ordinary oxygen it was later de-
velopments and modifications of this ray that we found
to have the ability to disintegrate steel in a similar man-
ner by destroying the very cohesion between its atoms
   we have the method our first space flyer is almost
ready all we have to do is to circle the earth as a
satellite changing our course whenever necessary ex-
posing all its atmosphere to our ray of course when-
ever we destroy the ozone in some particular section of
the atmosphere the remaining ozone will tend to diffuse
to distribute itself equally throughout the atmosphere
but it will not be long until we will have destroyed so
much that the remaining amount evenly distributed
will be insufficient to screen out the actinic rays  

  i hereby order that you eenedar be given full
authority and command over the forces of cor proceed
to carry out your plan with the greatest possible speed

  the spokesman of the council of nine signaled that
the meeting was at an end 

          chapter xxvii
          the fury of izanne

all that remained of the interplanetarian was a
heap of impalpably fine steel dust rapidly oxidiz-
ing the warm night-winds of venus were scat-
tering it in all directions

  a group of anxious men stood nearby on the plateau
benny jacobs was alternately crying and swearing the
ray from the corian plane had destroyed only steel but
certain vital parts of his radio and television apparatus
were steel

  burton boyd and di bargi conferred for several min-
utes and called the men together di bargi outlined his
plan

  before day we must erect some shelter from the
sun or well all die horribly like carton the glass
windows of the rocket were not destroyed though some
of them were shattered when the rocket collapsed and
let them fall there was some wooden furniture aboard
and some collapsible shelter-shacks we shall have to
dig these out of the dust immediately try not to get
any more of the dust in your nostrils than you can help
everyone get busy at once   

  two newcomers appeared in the blackness you will
hardly have time to recover your shelters and erect them
professor said lee chilton meriden and i can guide
you to a cave not far from here its some hundred of
feet down the cliff and there is a broad ledge in front of
it if you men have the nerve to climb down the vertical
cliff

  before dawn they were all safe in the cave in which
lee chilton had first met the swordsman of sarvon
lee and meriden had gone down into the jungle beneath
them in search of food

before dawn the corian warplane had passed over
sarvon time and time again and the invisible ray
had flashed down to the magnificent single structure of
steel miles in each dimension that was the city of meri-


amazing stories

den the corians did not send a visible ray this time
with the ray that destroyed they did not need to see
delicate magnetic indicators enabled them to locate the
city accurately and they checked the needles readings
with charts of the citys location six million tons of
steel cannot be hidden by darkness from a magic needle
down through the warm fog stabbed the steel-destroy-
ing ray and the murderous plane from cor departed in
the darkness then a member of its crew discovered
izanne

  she was bleeding from a jagged cut received from a
fragment of the fuel tank that had exploded the frag-
ment had gashed her left shoulder deeply from the front
coming very near to the subclavian artery it had
miraculously missed damaging any bone but the girl
was deprived of the use of the arm

  the commander of the corian plane knowing how
anxious the council was to recapture the girl ordered
the surgeon of the warplane to give her the best of care
he treated the ugly wound carefully but he was unable
to bring her back to consciousness the disabled plane
continued toward cor at half speed news of its suc-
cess was radioed to the council of nine planes were
sent from cor to meet it with fuel and to take the girl
to cor as quickly as possible the plans of eenedar
were materializing with lightning speed it would be a
matter of hours only before he would be ready to leave
with a few men in the one completed rocket fully
equipped to navigate space and to destroy the ozone of
the earth the other two space-ships would be ready
to carry the bulk of the corian population to the earth
after the terrestrial hordes had been killed by the rays
above the violet it was a matter of hours before eenedar
left and the council intended to torture izanne until
she divulged the secret in the notebook atomic power
would be useful to eenedar if they could obtain the
key to the cipher before the rocket left the surgeon
worked unceasingly over the girl as the warplane headed
toward cor she was breathing normally but for some
reason izanne did not return to consciousness outside
it was dark with the darkness that comes before dawn

  she was clever laura ives as a matter of cold fact
she was quite conscious for half an hour before the sur-
geon knew it and he only lived to know it for a few
insignificant seconds her good right fist crashed into
his skull with the uncanny superhuman strength she pos-
sessed strength and power acquired with her transfer of
bodies she had patiently waited for her chance to
strike the surgeon had come too near and had died
without even a gasp izanne rose from the table on
which she had been lying and washed the blood from
her fist in the surgeons basin she did not look again
at the man whose skull she had crushed

  single-handed literally single-handed she set about
to capture the ten-ton warplane cold fury possessed
her she had five men to deal with the surgeon and
one of the crew were dead the commander the radio
operator and three of the crew were left she sought
the radio-room first it was nearest to the surgeons
cramped quarters as she entered the room the oper-
ator wheeled to face her as he leaped his hand on one
of the three swords always carried by venerians the
girl leaped too avoiding the keen blade by inches and
with one blow crushed the operators skull he fell
against her bandaged shoulder bruising the wound but
in spite of the pain she took one of the swords and

smashed the instruments cutting off all communication

  the noise was heard outside the radio-room a few
moments later the commander and another corian en-
tered with drawn swords instinctively izanne hurled
the heavy balanced blade from her hand it buried it-
self to the hilt in the breast of the second corian al-
most at the same second the commander threw his sword
with the uncanny skill of the trained venerian sword-
fighter it did not wound her the commander had not
intended to touch her but it passed so close to her side
that it pinned her clothing to the hardwood wall be-
fore she could disengage the torn tunic-like venerian
garment the commander with an inscrutable smile was
holding the point of another of his swords at her throat
she was captive again

  or at least so the commander thought he didnt
live to think anything else the anger that possessed
izanne was not passionate it was deliberate and cold
and calculating she knew of her supernormal strength
and she knew that the commander was in all probability
ignorant of it she permitted him to bind her broke
the cords and killed him when he was expecting no re-
sistance at all she found the remaining two of the cor-
ians together in the control-room and killed on as he
left she entered the room and used the point of her
sword to demand obedience from the one remaining cor-
ian at her direction he headed the plane toward sar-
von  but told her that there was not enough fuel left to
reach the city and that it had been destroyed with the
steel-fatigue ray whereupon she ordered him to land on
the plateau between the two cities this he did as the
damaged plane jolted to a stop on the uneven rock its
lurch jerked the frightened corian pilot forward upon
izannes already-reddened sword for a few seconds
she sat frozen looking at the dying corian then the
reaction came and she covered her face with her good
arm and burst into hysterical sobbing she seemed to
see her slain brothers face harry old chap i guess 
i guess youre avenged now

chapter xxviii
retaliation

just before dawn meriden had killed with a
thrown sword a fine buck of a species of venerian
antelope nocturnal in its habits in the pale light
he and lee were carrying the venison toward the cliff
when they saw the immense corian plane pass overhead
and descend toward the plateau it had seemed about
to land

  eagerly they climbed to the cave with their burden
of meat left it there with the cook of the interplanetar-
ians crew and continued up the cliff to the top of the
ascent it had been a fatiguing climb even to them
the sun was well up in the always-clouded sky when
they saw the plane motionless cautiously swords
ready they approached it there were no signs of life
on board the plane they recognized it as the one they
had been fighting in the early part of the night they
entered it and foynd izanne crying a little in her weary
sleep

  she was very beautiful to the two men who loved her
beautiful in spite of her torn and blood-stained garments
each of the men stepped forward instinctively to lift her
in his arms and their eyes met coolly meriden and lee
the swordsman of sarvon



chilton knew that they were rivals and according to
the venus-code rivals fought to the death yet they
were comrades   

  four fast planes landed skilfully near the motionless
large one  the planes sent from cor with extra fuel
the commander of one of them had orders to bring the
girl to cor the twelve corians from the planes were
suspicious the warplane had suddenly ceased to com-
municate with cor and they had had a difficult search
before sighting it here on the plateau they approached
it cautiously swords drawn then meriden and lee
chilton attracted by the noise of the corian planes ap-
peared in the fuselage door of the large plane and three
of the corians recognized the swordsman of sarvon

  then began the greatest fight of meriden the sarvon-
ian before that battle was over each of his three
jaguar-hilted swords had drunk deep of blood and his
own blood stained the rocks one of the corians had
reentered his own plane and radioed to cor the other
eleven had attacked the two in the doorway of the larger
skyship and meriden had leaped to the combat al-
ways at his side was the earthman lee chilton hardly
a less formidable opponent than the giant for lee
fought with the fencing-technique of earth unfamiliar
to the corians who except when throwing them were
accustomed to using the edges of their swords rather
than the points    unfamiliar and deadly

  the corians did not force the combat they had
plenty of time and they were numerically superior
working systematically in shifts of four they under-
took to exhaust their two enemies twelve of them there
were and when four were tired four fresh and rested
swordsmen took their places but the two who were pro-
tecting izanne had not a minutes respite neverthe-
less the corians made one fatal mistake they jeered
at meriden and boastingly told him of the fate of his
city it drove the giant mad in a minute and a half
he killed three of his opponents the others retreated to-
ward their planes

  as they did so they seized the opportunity to throw
swords which they had not dared to do previously for
fear of hitting their own comrades meriden could
hurl swords too in this way he wounded another cor-
ian enough to keep him out of the battle and he acquired
his third wound of this particular battle lee chilton
had five but only one of them was at all serious

  but the corians were succeeding it was easy to
see that meriden needed a rest desperately the eight
corians determined not to give him a second to recover
and crowded around the two to finish them lee and
meriden backed toward the warplane a scratch on the
giants forehead was bleeding freely and the blood
was getting into his eyes his breath came in enormous
choking gasps the eight enemies were confident now
that they had won meriden took a second to wipe the
blood from his eyes with the back of his hand and in that
second lee with a sword in each hand after the vener-
ion fashion stepped in front of the giant and protected
him until he could see again then for a while they were
fighting back to back for protection against the sur-
rounding circle of warriors one more of their opponents
was disabled now but the unequal battle was going to
the corians meriden was practically blind and bleeding
from a dozen wounds lee was weak from loss of blood
suffering more physical pain than he had previously be-
lieved possible for a man to endure but he could

yet see blood from his wounds had not blinded him

  suddenly he saw izanne in the doorway motioning
the two men to retreat toward the warplane lee took
meridens arm and drew him swiftly back the move
was unexpected by the corians and for a second they
were alone in a group of seven

  in that second laura ives exposed them to the steel-
fatigue ray and every one of their swords disintegrated
into impalpable dust meanwhile meriden had again
wiped the blood from his eyes the seven men stood
motionless a moment and leaped toward their planes
meriden leaped to forestall them lee shouted to izanne
to turn the ray-projector on the planes she shook her
head and snapped off the ray wondering lee rushed
to meridens aid two of the corians managed to take
off in one of the planes the other five were held at
bay by lee and meriden the corians knew that it
would take little provocation indeed to cause meriden
to run them through

  the girl had snapped on the ray again and had turned
the projector mounted on top of the fuselage of the war-
plane so that it caught the escaping corian plane it
disintegrated and the two men in it were wearing no
parachutes

  then after a short conversation with the girl meri-
den and lee forced their prisoners at sword-points to
refill the tanks of the warplane with the fuel which the
smaller planes had brought in a few moments lee had
disabled the corian planes and then the warplane rose
with meriden at the controls lee stood by intending to
relieve the giant when he tired and izanne watched the
two men furtively sensing the coolness between them
none of the three said anything the giant and the
earthman needed medical attention badly it soon be-
came evident that meriden intended to land on the broad
ledge in front of the cave he did it well considering
that he had lost several pints of blood was suffering
from upwards of ten open wounds and was blinded by
the blood that persisted in flowing into his eyes

  the staff of the inter planetarian treated their wounds
and attended to the wound of izanne her real identity
was revealed to the group from the earth benny jacobs
was beside himself with grief here was startling news-
material and his beloved news-unit was out of touch with
the earth benny burst into genuine tears and the tech-
nical staff of the news unit redoubled their efforts at
improvising a usable cosmic radio from the material at
hand which wasnt much it was evident that to re-
open communication with the earth new motors and
generators and instruments would be necessary

  meriden took the first opportunity he could to speak
to izanne is it true that    that they were successful
in destroying sarvon with that ray he asked haltingly

  the girl did not reply but he read the answer in her
eyes it seemed to crush the giant his city-nation de-
stroyed it had existed for centuries that proud city
that one great structural unit with its foundations deep in
the jungle mire and its upper levels among the clouds
destroyed meriden was not quite able tp comprehend
completely that idea izanne held out her hand to him
and he took it gratefully tried to tell her a little of his
grief but choked on it and turned away the swords-
man of sarvon was ashamed of tears there was some-
thing else he wanted to tell her too but somehow he
could not speak freely to this earthgirl

  he left her and sat by himself in the cave opening


amazing stories

brooding wondering if he were the last of the sar-
vonians alive thousands of them must have been killed
when the structure collapsed ran his thoughts but cer-
tainly thousands must have survived but with no tools
of steel with nothing to protect them from the beasts of
the jungle they could not exist long he decided to go
to sarvon in the plane at least he had some swords
left good swords wrought of tempered steel and bur-
nished gold perhaps he could help

  it was not until he ceased to brood and started to
think that he thought of the perfectly good projector
of the steel-fatigue ray mounted in that little fenced-
in enclosure on top of the fuselage of the corian plane
ir a few seconds it could be lowered into the fuselage
itself and projected downward through an opening in
the floor it was a two-edged weapon cor was built
of steel too there was plenty of fuel in the plane
both for the motors and for the generators that sup-
plied the power for the ray he had a means of re-
venge but two men would be necessary one to pilot the
plane and one to operate the projector meriden went
in search of lee chilton

  upon learning of her identity burton boyd had ob-
tained from laura ives the key to the intricate code her
brother had used she carefully detailed to him the
mathematical processes by which the complex cipher
could be made to yield its secret

  burton boyd was more than anxious to send this
knowledge to the earth there was no longer any dan-
ger of war on the earth and the secret of the liberation
and control of intra-atomic energy would be of tremen-
dous value to the earth but it did not seem possible to
accomplish communication across the void burton
boyd was irritated by his inability to get into communica-
tion with robert huston and brad-henson ecclestone
but he did not realize how vital to the world that com-
munication would shortly become

  after his wounds had been dressed lee chilton
sought out izanne finding her just after she was through
speaking with boyd who had wandered back toward the
interior of the cave

  very gently because of her injured arm lee chilton
took her in his arms and kissed her upturned lips he
was startled a little at the fervor with which she returned
the kiss her slender body was suddenly very limp
against his and she started to cry softly burying her
face in his shoulder

  and so it was that meriden found them

  meriden was very calm now his face betrayed no
emotion in a low voice he asked lee to go with him
in the plane to avenge sarvon to destroy the city and
the immense rockets with which the corians intended to
invade the earth

  lee went with meriden in the warplane of cor and
left behind him a tarry-eyed girl   

  neither of the two men spoke as the plane hurtled to-
ward cor it was very hot in the plane in spite of the
speed they were making and the wind which it produced
in the well-ventilated skyship meriden handled the con-
trols always climbing lee adjusted the projector to
point downward and waited thinking of izanne he
was sure she loved him though she had not said so nor
had he himself confessed his love in words words
werent necessary they understood each other but
meriden    how would the giant take it  lee knew
that the swordsman loved the girl sincerely and that

meriden considered lee to have a right to her love only
if a duel proved lee to be the better man he was not
a coward lee chilton but he hated the thought of fight-
ing the giant swordsman with whom he had shared so
many adventures

  the sudden appearance of half a dozen corian planes
sent to investigate the mysterious silence of the first
four snapped lee out of his meditations he had dis-
covered what were evidently sights for the accurate
aiming of the ray and he had disintegrated the six planes
almost before they were aware of the large plane above
them the skyship roared on toward cor

  a series of tremendous explosions at intervals of three
seconds rocked the plane far ahead lee saw through
the observation windows of the fuselage a tremendous
object shaped like a dirigible without motors or cabins
it was rising vertically at tremendous and accelerating
speed brilliant flame emerged from its lower end in
the few seconds it took for the object to disappear com-
pletely in the clouds lee realized that it was the first
of the rockets leaving for the earth but he did not know
that aboard it was eenedar meteorologist of cor with
fuel equipped for destroying the vital ozone of the earths
atmosphere

  he and meriden were some five minutes too late if
they could have prevented the going of that rocket they
would have rendered an incalculable service to the earth
but by the time they reached cor the rocket was already
out of the atmosphere of venus

  so unexpected was their attack on cor that it was
entirely successful the ray flashed down invisibly and
through the sights lee saw the immense city crumple
into dust as it was exposed to the ray developed by its
own scientists it was slaughter the earthmen realized
but only in that way could the power of the earths great-
est enemy be broken they had shown no mercy to
sarvon they had calmly laid plans to decimate the earth
which they did not need because they coveted its wealth
and power they were reaping precisely what they had
sown it was like magic to see the structure crumple and
collapse and dissolve into powder and it was horrible yet
the city of cor would never again threaten the earth
there was no chance to organize resistance the ray
brought down the few planes that managed to take off
the survivors thought lee grimly could take up again
the age-old fight with the jungle if the race survived
perhaps the hardship would make it eleaner and better

  it seems to be true that a great nation falls when it
seeks wealth and power and luxury which it does not
need

  cor was destroyed yet that one rocket that escaped
was speeding toward an unwarned defenseless earth   

chapter xxix
the battle of the sky-hordes

yet cor was not dead yet near the city was an
enormous cleared space in the jungle the two
incomplete rockets of the corians were being built
there and the third had just left its berth between the
other two

  perhaps half of the corians had gone to this enclosure
to see the rocket leave myriads of little planes were
parked near the rockets besides the citizens who had
come to watch the rockets departure there were also
the swordsman of sarvon



thousands of workers in the great and busy enclosure

  lee had not attacked the rockets with his ray he
remembered the group of marooned earthmen in the
cave who could not endure the sunlight of venus because
of its actinic rays and he decided that the rockets should
not be destroyed at least one of them must be saved
for di bargi

  and so while the warplane passed and repassed over
the crumbling city of cor a swarm of little planes took
off from the enclosure most of them were armed
though few possessed the recently developed steel-fatigue
ray they were armed with the corian heat-ray and an
electrical ray that paralyzed the engines of planes it
touched venerian planes had always fought with rays
the use of projectiles had never been developed on the
hot planet

  and so the big warskyship was surrounded by in-
numerable little planes every one of them bent on re-
venge for a moment it seemed that the big plane could
cut its way out of the swarm plane after plane sud-
denly fell to pieces in the air as lee manipulated the big
projector but there were too many of them heat rays-
were striking the armored walls and making the interior
temperature intolerable n

  then the motors missed and stopped dead one of the
corian rays had short-circuited every electrical connec-
tion on the big plane including the generator that pro-
vided the power for the steel-fatigue ray projector lee
threw the battery switch desperately perhaps the pro-
jector could be operated for a while on the batteries no
results it was evident that the corian ray was short-
circuiting the storage batteries too

  the plane was falling erratically meriden was trying
to volplane down but the skyship was too heavy and the
wing that had been disabled by meridens bullets the pre-
vious night rendered a smooth descent impossible

  suddenly the motors caught on again the unknown
corian had not been skilful enough to follow the erratic
fall of the plane with his short-circuiting ray it was al-
most a perfect conductor of electricity that ray and no
electrical device exposed to it could operate but once
out of its field of influence the plane was not perma-
nently damaged

  instantly lee reversed the switch and disintegrated
the nearest little plane then the conducting ray stopped
the engines again and the warplane dropped the tem-
perature was intolerable lee looked at one of the win-
dows in the fuselage and saw that the glass was fusing
under the influence of one or more of the heat rays he
stepped aside just as a beam of unendurable heat struck
the projector which was pointing downward through the
opening in the fuselage floor in a vain attempt to save
the projector from the effects of the heat ray lee threw
the switch that lifted the projector up through the top
of the fuselage to that fenced-in enclosure from whence
the projector could be pointed upward in his frenzy
he forgot that the power was off again the hoists did
not work and the projector itself was fusing from the
heat

  meriden in the pilots compartment strove to keep the
plane under control both he and lee realized that he
was not doing so but the earthman was powerless to
help in a terrestrial plane lee chilton could have main-
tained control but he had never learned anything of the
controls of a venerian airplane

  the plane landed smashing its undercarriage in the

space between the two nearly-completed rockets meri-
den and lee leaped out each with a sword in each hand
hundreds of corians ran toward the plane all armed
with heavy swords of good steel the enclosure where
the rockets were being built had not been exposed to the
ray that had destroyed the city of cor

  once more lee chilton found himself at the side of
the swordsman of sarvon fighting for life itself against
odds it looked rather hopeless to lee their wounds
of a few hours ago were still painful in spite of the care
they had been given by the surgeon from di bargis crew
of earthmen never before had the odds against them
been so great well all had to die sometime   

  no said chilton suddenly a second before the near-
est of his enemies reached him no im going to live
shed be sorry if i died

  for one second meriden looked at him with steel-gray
eyes then they gave their attention to the fighters that
were crowding around both their backs were against
the fuselage of the wrecked plane and they were side by
side lee fought with desperation but the giant swords-
man was very cool an enigmatic smile flickered on the
sarvonians lips with the efficiency of a scientific ma-
chine he dispatched the first unfortunate individual who
opposed him seized the mans swords and hurled them at
three corians who were near the range was short and
the giants aim was perfect each of the three corians
died a clean painless death before realizing that he had
been struck this seemed to give the corians an idea
at a shouted signal they all drew back and devoted their
time to throwing swords with such overpowering
numbers perhaps it would be better to fight the two
hated sarvonians at long range they had plenty of
swords the two by the plane had only six to begin with
and would have to pick up any others that they used

  there are two ways of dealing with an accurately
thrown sword it can be dodged or it can be fended off
by clever very clever manipulation of the defenders
sword or swords meriden stood planted turning aside
the swords of his enemies with those j aguar-hilted swords
of his own lee dodged he had had no practice in turn-
ing aside swords and he wished devoutly for armor the
heavier the better to say nothing of a shield a peculiar
anachronistic civilization indeed it had aircraft heat-
rays and many other modern achievements but the scien-
tists of venus had apparently never thought of inventing
a shield lee side-stepped another sword which clanged
against the planes armor plate planes were armored
against heat-rays yet no venerian warrior ever wore any
armor there was some reason in that at least ran the
earthmans thoughts the damned planet was hot enough
for a man in a tunic let alone trying to run around in a
suit of tin lee dodged another sword the corians
seemed to be stalling now playing for time three
more swords came close yet lee escaped unscathed
they would have to get busier he thought if they in-
tended to kill him within a month or so

  before they could run for their lives a flaming plane
crashed into the group of corians its fuel tank ex-
ploded lee had one seconds glimpse of meriden falling
under a flaming piece of the wreckage jyid then some-
thing knocked him cleanly into the blackness of uncon-
sciousness

  the swarm of planes that had brought down the war-
skyship had not been able to follow up their advantage
before they could land a second swarm approached


amazing stories

rapidly through the clouds and the startled corians
recognized them as sarvonian planes

  the two swarms met and fought it was not one large
battle but rather tended to break up into thousands of
duels and the corians soon realized that the sarvonian
planes were faster and more flexibly maneuverable and
that they had weapons which were new to venus the
steady tot-tot-tot-tot-tot of the sarvonian machine guns
spelled out the final doom of cor

  for every plane brought down by the heat ray or the
short-circuiting ray of cor a dozen fell to the bullets
of sarvon    steel-jacketed incendiary explosive bul-
lets every few minutes one of them would penetrate a
corian fuel-tank   

  lee chilton was not unconscious more than three min-
utes he regained his senses to see meriden leaning over
him with that same unfathomable smile and close to
meridens side was another whom lee recognized as
xavian supreme ruler of sarvon

chapter xxx

the rare earth metals

it had been short and decisive that battle the
corian planes had fallen by scores and those that
were left soon showed the green signal of surrender
some of the sarvonian planes had caught sight of the
two standing by the wrecked skyship and had recognized
the giant meriden at radio orders from xavian who
was personally commanding the expedition the nearest
sarvonian pilots had looped low to let their gunners strafe
the corians by the two immense rockets they were
aided by the accident of the flaming corian planes fall
in the group threatening the two comrades landing
immediately the sarvonians in xavians plane had
thrown aside the fragments of flaming wood and twisted
steel that had almost buried meriden who was stunned
and burned but not seriously hurt and in a minute more
they had brought lee chilton back to consciousness

  then meriden addressed his ruler i am glad you
escaped the destruction of the city

  xavian looked dumbfounded the only city that has
been destroyed is the city of cor and you destroyed
that he stated i do not understand you

  sarvon was not destroyed the giants voice was
incredulous and trembling xavian hastened to reas-
sure him

  certainly not but we had given you up as lost
when you did not return we decided to strike at once
these new weapons were made by grantolon and his
staff under the direction of the three brothers dornn of
the earth whom you saved from death at corian hands
they are with us now in one of the planes their wea-
pons have saved your life in turn you are well repaid
i do not understand said the bewildered giant and
he proceeded to inform xavian of the corian plane that
had passed over sarvon in the darkness with the steel-
fatigue ray he told of the effectiveness of that ray
in all the other instances they had seen it operated and
indeed xavian himself could see by the most casual
glance at what had once been the proud city-nation of
cor that there was no doubting the destructive effect
of that ray upon steel nor could lee chilton offer any
explanation of the rays failure to destroy sarvon they
discussed it as xavians plane flew homeward sur-
rounded by the air-fleet of sarvon deciding that either

the corians had made a mistake as to the location of
sarvon or else had been amiss in some way about the
projection of the ray

  neither of these suppositions was true

  at the suggestion of meriden and lee chilton
xavian ordered his pilot and about a dozen others to stop
with him at the cave containing the party from earth
the broad ledge of the cliff gave ample room for the
skilful landing of planes the rest of the fleet returned
to sarvon except those who had been stationed in the
enclosure near cor to supervise the prisoners

  it was again late in the day when xavians plane ap-
proached the immense mountain barrier that rose out
of the jungle between sarvon and cor through the
planes telescope lee saw the cave opening on the ledge
all the earth party were out of sight in the interior for
the sun was still in the clouded sky but laura ives had
nothing to fear in her venerian body and she was out-
side watching the heavens anxiously lee saw her jump
up and wave at the plane he leaned out of the circular
window of the cabin and waved back as the plane
landed he noticed again the cool smile of meriden

  xavian was surprised to see izanne but said little
meriden xavian izanne and lee entered the cave
meriden introduced his ruler and lee chilton presented
the earth party

  upon learning of the disaster to the earth-rocket
xavian promised to have the sarvonian scientists and
builders complete the corian rockets one of which he
presented to the earth professor di bargi accepted
joyously then the old sarvonian expressing the hope
that soon interplanetary commerce and friendship such
as had existed in the pre-hellene days of atlantis would
soon be reestablished to the benefit of both worlds asked
the earth-party to be his guests in sarvon at di bargis
request the chemist of the party explained that the earth-
men could not endure the venerian sunlight and it was
decided to wait in the cave the few hours before night-
fall and to embark then for sarvon which would be
reached before morning

  the conversation had been in english which xavian
spoke fluently suddenly the girl gave a startled ex-
clamation in the sarvonian tongue sarvon was not
destroyed after all she said and then to meriden by
way of explanation i was almost sure that it hadnt
been but i didnt dare tell you until i knew i was almost
sure   

  xavian and meriden and lee chilton listened intently
to her explanation later she gave it in english for the
benefit of the terrestrials

  my brother harrison ives was the worlds greatest
authority on the rare earth metals such as dysprosium
yttrium lutecium samarium and so on he spent years
investigating their physical and chemical properties and
among the things he discovered was this certain of the
rare metals if alloyed with steel in sufficient quantities
make it immune to what is called steel-fatigue

  for centuries steel-fatigue had been known it was
first investigated seriously back in the first part of the
twentieth century it occurs at rare intervals some-
times a steel bridge or building would suddenly collapse
while under nounusual strain for no assignable reason
it seemed as if the steel had become tired and the phe-
nomenon was called steel-fatigue

  my brothers fatigue-proof alloy was steel with a
high vanadium content plus almost three percent of
amazing stories



ruthenium and small quantities of samarium and other
elements of the rare earth group the alloy was not
at all practicable commercially sixty pounds or
more of rare-earth metals to each ton of steel
was far too costly most of the metals of that group
are more difficult to obtain and cost far more than gold
or platinum steel fatigue was such a rare and negligible
occurrence that it was not worth the immense amount of
money necessary to guard against it seldom would it
manifest itself over an entire structure anyway such
cases were rare though they were known to have oc-
curred but once in a while some vital part of a ma-
chine will break when there seems no logical reason for
it to do so my brother patented this process for he was
working on the problem of transmutation had he suc-
ceeded the rare metals might have become cheap and the
process would automatically have become commercially
feasible

  when i was working in the metal laboratories with
grantolon i learned a lot about the steel of sarvon
the entire structure is built of steel made from ore
mined at one place the mines of crokan-venn i believe
they are called upon analyzing this ore i found it
to contain a very high percentage of ruthenium com-
pounds with vanadium and traces of samarium and
palladium rare on earth perhaps and very costly but
these metals seem to be common in the ores of venus

  and i also learned that the sarvonians seldom took
the trouble to get rid of these impurities

  for most purposes they did not in the least impair
the quality of the steel

  the corians ray produced an artificial steel-fatigue
thousands of times more complete than that which some-
times occurs naturally on the earth and i did not
know whether sarvonian steel would withstand its ef-
fects but it did

  i was almost sure that it would  

  corian steel on the other hand is all produced from
ore mined in another place some locality where the rare
earth elements do not occur associated with ferrous
ores in every case where their ray proved effective the
steel that was disintegrated was corian steel or else
steel from the earth

  she was a scientist in her own right laura ives lee
checked back in his memories of that ray and saw that
she was right no sarvonian steel had ever been affected
by the ray

  quite obviously sarvonian steel must be immune

  there was a momentary lull in the conversation once
benjamin jacobs seized eagerly his chance to ask a
question

  say mr xavian er  your majesty   would i be
able to obtain electrical equipment in your city enough
to repair a cosmic radio and television outfit

  certainly we have finely equipped radio labora-
tories and all types of metal-working and electrical
shops

  our engineers will be glad to help you

  benny tried to express his gratitude but his heart
was too full after all his troubles in trying to keep
the news-hungry earth informed he realized that at last
there was little probability of further interruptions the
greatest scoop in the history of newsgathering was to
be afforded on his unprecedented if successful inter-
planetary voyage

  benny already visualized himself with a mike before
him talking to all the world

chapter xxxi
a confession and a challenge

it was not until the embarkment after nightfall
that lee chilton got a chance to see laura ives
alone two bloody disheveled figures they were
but if anyone cared it wasnt lee chilton or laura ives
the wounds of that battle-filled day carefully bandaged
though they were ached continually but lee paid no
attention to them the girls wound more serious than
any single one of lees was badly in need of attention
and clean bandages but izanne didnt seem to notice it
while the possessions of the earthmen were being loaded
in the corian planes laura and lee walked a short
distance along the ledge in order to be alone sheer
vertical cliffs rose above their heads and fell away be-
neath their feet

  i dont like this darn planet said lee chilton in a
manner intended to be abstract

  why not

  it hasnt got a moon were entitled to a moon
lovers have had moons since the earth began and all
we get is a fog

  their conversation suffered a slight interruption very
sweet and laura ives replied

  thats not the biggest difference between earth and
venus

  what is

  just this lee no one on this planet ever heard of
a kiss if meriden had kissed me once i guess it would
have been he and not you   

  she was silent for a minute

  you see lee on earth i was always a wall-flower
no fellow ever paid any attention to me i just wasnt
attractive no matter how hard i tried to be charming
the only one that ever cared for me was my brother
harrison and i was devoted to him i just had to have
something to love even if it was only my brother and
his science

  and then this cosmic transfer took place and i woke
up to find i had a beautiful body it was too wonderful
to believe the corian girl izanne who took my body
on earth and killed harry had intended to be transferred
back to her own body after she had done her bit for the
corian plans and i was kept imprisoned in cor so that
the body would be ready when she radioed but meriden
was spying in cor and he helped me to escape and took
me to sarvon i was a guest of xavian and i helped
grantolon in the laboratories i helped a lot in the scien-
tific work because lots of things i had learned from
harry werent known on venus in many lines their
science is way behind that of the earth

  i used the name izanne even meriden didnt know
i was realy an earth-identity in a venus-body until that
day in the corian council room when i betrayed our pres-
ence and you and meriden had to fight your way out

  while i was helping grantolon in the laboratories
some of the sarvonian gallants started to court me
sarvonians are awfully strict and formal in their love-
affairs then they started to kill each other over me
they fight to the death for their mates here there
are so few girls compared to the number of men i
didnt want them to kill each other on account of me but
i couldnt do anything about it by a sort of unwritten
law or custom it was almost compulsory for me to marry
the survivor and he was meriden


amazing stories

  i liked him better than any other too and for a while
i thought i was in love with him he was awfully nice
but sometimes i wished he wouldnt be so formal i
wanted him to kiss me but it seems that no one on
venus had any idea of what a kiss is sometimes i won-
der how they do show their affection

  meriden gave me that beautiful belt its in the cave
now i wore it for him ill have to give it back now
its the venerian equivalent of an engagement ring

  but ive been realizing that i could never be happy
with a venerian lee i want an earth-man with his
virtues and his faults theyre far more human than
venerian swordsmen and you might give me a genu-
ine osculation such as are dispensed on the earth moon
or no moon

  what more ejaculated lee chilton softly what
a greedy girl

  they were startled a little by meridens cough the
sarvonian was standing near them in the darkness they
cculd see that he was holding a broad belt of beauti-
fully tanned leather with a buckle beautifully wrought
in steel and gold to represent the head of a jaguar it
was the device of the line of meriden that steel and
golden jaguar

  izanne took a step toward him im sorry to return
it she said but i could never be happy with a venerian
mate nor could you with an earthgirl meriden   

  she hesitated not knowing what to say and held out
her hand toward the giant he did not seem to notice
it the belt fell out of his hand and he did not notice
that either

  i will not give up my claim to you said meriden
of sarvon nor will i ask my comrade to relinquish his

  he spoke to lee

  about a month from now earthman when your
wounds have completely healed i will meet you in a
duel to the death

  there was a shout from the direction of the loaded
planes the entire party was ready to leave for the
flight to sarvon and the absence of the three had been
discovered

  izanne stood motionless lee chilton shrugged his
shoulders old timer he remarked ill take you up
on that proposition he felt the girls body tremble as
without a word the three of them turned and walked to-
ward the planes

  the same inscrutable smile played about meridens
lips but in his eyes was pain    and it was not physical
pain

           chapter xxxii
           a matter of ozone

the next few days were joyful ones for benny
jacobs with the equipment available at sarvon
he had reestablished communication with the earth
six hours or more each day news-unit thirteen broad-
cast from venus the entire world listened in on the
re-broadcast from the stations of universal news and
the eurasian news-syndicate the entire story of cors
plan to conquer the earth was told over the interplane-
tary circuit the earth was eager to see venus and each
day the televisor showed interesting scenes in the city
of sarvon or in the venerian jungles through the co-
operation of the news companies treaties of friendship
and commerce were drawn up between the planets and
signed di bargi being given the right to act for the

newly-formed federation of earth-nations scientific
news and discoveries and data were exchanged to the
benefit of both words and supervising it all was benny
jacobs in the eighth heaven of joy

  the earth was told of the corian rocket that was on
the way but that caused little concern to humanity as
there could be no reenforcements from cor the earth
was quite sure that it could handle the situation when
the rocket landed they did not know that eenedar did
not intend to land when he reached the earth but planned
to allow the rocket to be caught by the earths gravitation
in such a way that it would revolve around the earth as a
small satellite expending none of its limited fuel they
didnot know that eenedar had any plan to destroy the
ozone of the earth nor did they realize that every
word of the interplanetary broadcast was received aboard
the rocket

  eenedar knew of the fate of cor and the knowledge
only made him more eager to wipe out the earth utterly
and completely no one on either planet knew about
eenedars plan except a few of the corian prisoners
who were careful to keep their knowledge to themselves
hoping that after all the earth might be conquered by
cor or at least that the population of the earth might be
wiped out to avenge the destrucion of the city-nation of
cor

  eenedar was insane now in his lust to kill he drove
the rocket through space at an always-increasing speed
though with a constant rate of acceleration that was close
to the limit of his mens endurance it is not great
speed that produces dangerous pressure on the human
body it is the great acceleration the rapid change of
speed necessary finally to obtain great speed

  as soon as benny had established communication
burton boyd got in touch with robert huston of united
utilities they spoke across the void there were gaps
of more than four minutes in their conversation because
of the distance between the planets and the fact that
radio waves only travel some  miles per second

  well bob said burton boyd the war-clouds have
rolled by were starting for home in about three weeks
tell ecclestone that the ives cipher is a double-substi-
tution roulette using the english system with the key-
word praseodymium the joker is that the original
message is in german instead of english no wonder
brad couldnt crack it

  laura ives tells me that her brother destroyed most
of his notes and the cipher gives only the bare essentials
of the process of converting atomic energy into usable
electricity your engineers will have to work out the
details

  a four minute pause

  fine ecclestone was listening in with me hes
just rushed off to get the notebook tell miss ives that
united utilities is buying all rights to the process for
the price agreed upon in a verbal agreement with her
brother the day before he was killed shes rich it
amounts to two hundred million a year for thirty years
plus a block of sixty thousand shares of preferred stock
in united utilities

  if you think you can break the news gently you
might also tell lee chilton that the courts have finally
decided about that freak will of eugene chilton its
thrown out lee is the sole heir he now possesses
outright fifty-one percent of the stock in the corporation
the cash value of his holding is just under one trillion
dollars i wish i were that man he enjoys himself
the swordsman of sarvon



on venus while im back here running his business for
him at a measly fifty thousand dollars a month

  incidentally burt youre discharged with thanks
youve accomplished what i hired you for besides being
instrumental in preventing a hellish war when you get
back to earth ill be quite glad to hand you a certified
check for one billion dollars plus  for expenses
a four minute pause

  thanks lee chilton was listening in with me
and he told me to notify you that starting next month
your salary was tripled and now lets get down to
something important

  you undoubtedly remember that eugene chilton
financed di bargis rocket in return for the exclusive
rights to all mineral wealth imported from venus in
case contracts could be negotiated with the inhabitants
lee and i and di bargi have just made some contracts
quite favorable to both the city of sarvon and united
utilities it seems that such rare and costly metals as
praseodymium ruthenium rubidium and others of the
rare-earth group are common here considering the
prices some of these metals are bringing on earth the
corporation should make quite a neat profit there are
also some uranium radium and thorium ores here ob-
tainable at about half the current price on earth and
furthermore venus will provide a steady market for
copper and silver you might take steps to corner a por-
tion of the market there you can buy a lot here with
a pound of pure copper

  after the conversation was over lee chilton turned
to burton boyd i may be the richest individual on
earth he said but it amounts to precisely zero on this
planet i cant marry the girl i love unless i kill meri-
den in a duel to the death in the first place im no
match for him and in the second place i like the man
its not his fault hes just living up to his code of honor
and i suppose it did hurt him when laura refused him

  ive made a will burt if meriden finishes me
laura gets everything even if she marries him

  how is she getting along

  as well as might be expected that shoulder wound
of hers is uglier than we realized theyve cleaned out
the infection it ought to heal now shes worrying ter-
ribly about this fight and its not helping the healing
process any

  do you really intend to go through with this duel
i cant back out without being branded a coward and
id hate to give the sarvonians such an idea of the ter-
restrial race

  but you havent a chance man that giant was
born to the sword and you never handled one until you
woke up on this planet

  i fenced a little at yale burt and meriden has
no idea o the thrust and parry he slashes exclusively
at close quarters all venerians do these heavy
swords they use are nowhere near as easy to handle as
foils but the one thing that gives me a chance is my
knowledge of fencing technique its new to venus
by the way they follow the same customs as the earth
about having seconds and a judge except that they use
three judges youll be my second

  certainly when is the duel

  twenty-seven days from today

  a lot can happen in twenty-seven days

eneder and the corian mathematician carefully
checked their calculations at the speed the rocket

was making they calculated that it would if not further
accelerated and if its course were not changed plunge
by the earth at a distance of slightly more than twenty
miles but it did not have enough speed to pas the
earth that closely instead of continuing off into space
it would be captured by the earths gravitational field
and drawn into an orbit the plane of which would be
almost perpendicular to that of the earths equator on
each of this artificially-produced satellites revolutions
about the earth it would pass near the poles and because
of its proximity to the earth and its comparatively small
mass its revolutions would be very swift more than
thirty in each twenty-four hours each time it shot
around the world at an altitude of approximately one
hundred and twenty-five miles it would pass over a dif-
ferent section of the rotating earth its speed would
be slightly better than ten miles a second they figured
and they would be high enough above the atmosphere
so they would not be slowed down by friction and yet
close enough so that their ray would destroy the ozone
in the earths upper atmosphere

  it was an intricate calculation taking into considera-
tion the masses and orbits and velocities of the earth and
the rocket the resistance of the atmosphere when the
rocket first plunged through it and dozens of minor
factors but at last eenedar was satisfied the great
speed of the rocket would make it practically impossible
for earth artillery to score a direct hit with a projectile
large enough to harm the rocket and eenedar knew that
one hundred and twenty-five miles was an extreme range
even for the most powerful guns of the earth though it
was practicable for the projector of his dissociating ray
one of the most beautiful features of his plan was the
lack of visible evidence of the splitting up of the ozone
molecules the ray was invisible the dissociated oxygen
atoms reassociated into ordinary oxygen molecules with
no violent show of energy or any other visible evidence
of the occurrence the inhabitants of the earth could
not see what was going on but as soon as the already
extremely small percentage of ozone in the air became
smaller no terrestrial could endure the light of the sun
those who were not killed by exposure to the sunlight
would have to remain in shelter and could not prevent
the landing of the rocket once on earth the steel-
fatigue ray employing almost the same principles as the
other would make easy the conquest of those who es-
caped the sunlight

  but eenedar did not intend to let any of them escape
the sunlight if his plan was successful the ozone of
the atmosphere would be removed before anyone on
earth realized what was happening

  when the earth was reached it was seen that the cal-
culations had been so near correct that the expenditure
of a little hydrogen perfected the rockets course it
had become very hot in its plunge through the earths
air-blanket but no harm was done it started its rapid
circling of the earth and its invisible ray was thinning
out the ozone of the earths atmosphere removing the
protective filter of the extreme ultra-violet rays destroy-
ing the balance of conditions under which life had grown
up on the earth

  there is a tremendous difference between a molecule
composed of three oxygen atoms and a molecule of only
two oxygen atoms astronomers of the earth followed
the rockets swift course they could detect no signs
of life or activity aboard it apparently it was a freely
revolving body a new satellite of the earth perhaps


amazing stories

the heat of the first plunge through the amosphere had
killed the corians statements were published claiming
that when the rocket had passed within twenty miles of
the earth the heat generated by its friction with the at-
mosphere had killed its occupants and that when it
had passed the earth and had been drawn back to its
present orbit it no longer constituted a menace

  but there were others who doubted that mere chance
was responsible for the fact that it passed over practically
all of the earth in less than one day its orbit seemed
to indicate brains not chance it was neatly calculated
the more wide-awake astronomers maintained and it
did not seem to be chance either that was responsible
for the fact that the orbit was just outside the most
extreme limits of the atmosphere

  no one on the earth could see how the rocket could do
any damage from its present position the earth sat
back to await some move on the part of the corians if
they were alive

  on the last day of october  after a round of
golf in spite of a chilly wind robert huston acting
president of united utilities was astounded as were
his three companions to see that every one of them had
a severe case of sunburn

  the same day nearly every child under three years
of age that was exposed to the sunlight was blinded with
terrible suffering everyone who had been exposed to
the sun was burnt to a greater or less degree and the
burns were not confined to outdoor people for ever
since  health-glass permitting the passage of ultra-
violet rays had been in almost universal use and the
powerful actinic rays at the extreme ultra-violet end of
the radiations was not filtered out by the health-glass
ordinary glass opaque to ultra-violet light had gone
completely out of use except for such things as drinking
glasses and electric bulbs

  but if conditions were bad in new york they were
infinitely worse in the equatorial regions and in the south-
ern hemisphere where it was spring instead of autumn
it was blindness and death in the tropics to stay in the
sunlight for ten minutes and many died before they
were well aware of trouble

  always blindness came first accompanied by horrible
burns then came death

  on that last day of october nearly a million people
died all of them in torturing pain eenedars thinning
of the ozone in the atmosphere had reached the crucial
stage

  ee dear please dont fight meriden hes de-
termined not to give me up and hell kill you di
j-bargi is leaving for the earth tonight we can
go with him meriden wont know until tomorrow
im getting well now lets go back to earth together

  we cant izanne you know very well that youre
in no shape to withstand the acceleration of an inter-
planetary voyage even if you could i couldnt let
meriden think i was a coward could you respect a
coward 

  i could love him

  but thats not what i ask you izanne well play
the game out to the end by the way your nurse told
me that meriden was visiting you today

yes i sent for him no sarvonian of the warrior
class will ever attack one of the aristocrats its consid-
ered dishonorable and i told him that you were an
aristocrat of the earth youre the earths richest man
 and-

    what did he say to that

    he told me that xavian had raised him to the rank
 of an aristocrat because of his part in the destruction of
 cor he was awfully relieved to find that you were an
 aristocrat too that made it quite proper for him to
 fight you lee im afraid    afraid   

   dont worry cosmic sweetheart you must hurry
 up and get well so that the next time di bargi comes
 we can go home with him    together

   professor di bargi youre wanted on the
   earth-phone

    what seems to be the trouble benny

    i dont understand exactly something about ultra-
 violet light that is killing people on the world

    all right benny im coming

   when he reached the radioroom of the completed
 rocket that had been taken from cor the professor
 paused a moment to give his right-hand man some in-
 structions concerning the launching of the rocket then
 he got in touch with robert huston on the earth he
 listened to what the executive told him about the menace
 that was threatening the earth and he worked out a
 plan it was four hours later that he left the radio-
 room and the rocket was already on its way back to
 earth without lee or laura or burton boyd

    since the year  united utilities had been the
 largest and most powerful corporation on the earth and
 only that immense organization could have carried out
 the plan that di bargi had outlined the next twenty-
 four hours were the busiest of robert hustons life

    astronomers were put to work calculating the exact
 orbit of the rocket for hours and days in advance when
 these calculations were finished huston could tell by a
 glance at a chart just what locality the rocket would pass
 over at any given second up to a week in the future
 while these calculations were being made the great
 factories of united utilities were producing as if by
 magic the various apparatus being designed by united
 utilities engineering staff ten minutes after a blue-
 print of any part was finished in the drafting-rooms and
 telephotoed to a factory that part was being produced
 by suitable manufacturing machines

   working in the night in order to avoid the deadly
 sunlight skilled engineers and willing workmen erected
 two immense projectors or the venerian conducting ray
 details of which had been radioed from sarvon the
 projectors were half a mile apart in a spot in southern
 illinois over which the rocket would pass next morning
 the rays were tested they were perfect conductors of
 electricity like two immense wires running up into the
 heavens

    the bureau of weather control was ordered through
 the cooperation of the government of united america to
 furnish a clear cloudless day

    atomic disintegrators were manufactured and hooked
 up in series so that they could furnish electric power in
 quantities never before employed using an electrical
 pressure of trillions of volts

   supervising all of the work was robert huston a
 speedy plane took him to illinois before dawn astron-
 omers checked the rockets orbit and verified their former
the swordsman of sarvon



conclusions dawn came with its searing burning light
six seconds before the rocket traveling ten miles a sec-
ond was due to pass over the two stations in illinois
robert huston pressed the buttons that operated remote-
control switches which hooked up the two conducting
rays to the long series of atomic disintegrators the dis-
integrators converting atomic power into electrical
power built up a difference of potential in the two ver-
tical rays of trillions upon trillions of volts

  then the corian rocket closed the circuit

  the terrific discharge of electricity through the im-
mense rocket all but liquified it eenedar and his col-
leagues never realized what had hit them the enormous
momentum of the rocket carried it past the electrical trap
that had been set but it was a lifeless twisted piece of
metal now and it was slowed down to a speed not suffi-
cient to keep it from falling in a few minutes the
astronomers from observations of its new motion had
calculated with their efficient mechanical and electrical
mathematics machines that it would fall in the pacific
ocean five hundred miles north of hawaii in about
three days time ships were warned to keep away
from the danger zone

  huston got in touch with di bargi over the cosmic
radio and told him of the success of the plan

  di bargi grinned wondering idly what huston would
say when it was discovered that the tremendous discharge
of electricity even though it had taken place just outside
the atmosphere had produced an enormous amount of
ozone which would gradually distribute itself throughout
the upper atmosphere

chapter xxxiv

a duel to the death

ell lee said burton boyd seriously this
is the day how do you feel 

  im in perfect condition im sorry your
offering to be my second prevented you from going home
with di bargi

  thats all right hell be back in six months be-
sides i like this planet even though i cant go out in
the sunlight did you see the pretty nurse izanne has 
watch your step burt there are about sixteen
aspiring young sarvonians on the trail of that nurse
you had better start taking lessons in swordsmanship
right away if you intend to last until the semi-finals

  there was a knock on the door of their chamber
lee opened it and took laura in his arms

  when did they let you get up sweetheart

  they didnt lee i    well i slugged the nurse and
got dressed and came to see you i wanted one last kiss
 in case you didnt  didnt win the nurse told me
that i couldnt have any visitors because i was too weak
and i wanted to be sure of seeing you again and youre
terribly brutal lee i want it so much wont you
give it to me before i faint

  lee gave it to her and she fainted away from weak-
ness tenderly he carried her back to the section of
sarvon that was used as a hospital a frantic young
sarvonian nurse was nursing a lump on her head that
had been caused when laura had skilfully caressed her
with a heavy glass carafe but the nurse grinned when
her truant patient was brought back apparently not much
the worse for her escapade

  because of the fact that burton boyd could not with-

stand direct exposure to the venerian sunlight the duel
was scheduled in a large artificially-lighted chamber on
a lower level of the immense structure that was the city
of sarvon

  it was by no means a public affair but rather a private
matter of honor xavian supreme ruler of sarvon
was in the chamber with one trusted bodyguard when
lee and burton entered boyd carrying the three gleam-
ing swords that lee had borrowed three weeks previously
for the purpose of practicing

  meriden entered with three men behind him lee
recognized them as aloysius albert and william dornn
earth-identities in venerian bodies they surprised
lee just where did they fit in the picture when
back on earth his uncle eugene chilton had disin-
herited him the three dornn brothers had been made
legatees of the immense corporation now that will
had been set aside and lee was the recipient of united
utilities were the three brothers hoping that he would
be killed so that once back to earth they could claim the
controlling interest of the company

  at meridens waist hung his triplicate scabbard with
the three jaguar-hilted swords the giant was smiling
xavian called them together as two other sarvonians
who with xavian were to be the judges entered the spa-
cious room the doors were locked

  lee and meriden shook hands after the earth-fashion
there seemed to be no corresponding venerian custom

  the duel said xavian will be fought with pistols
lee started meriden smiled

  it was i who challenged said the giant i did not
think it fair to you to choose swords i have handled
swords from infancy

  i am perfectly willing to use swords

  i refuse earthman it is knowledge not pride that
makes me say i could slaughter you with a sword in
fifteen seconds and i would be a coward if i killed you
with swords particularly since i challenged you to this
fight these men continued the giant calmly indi-
cating the dornn brothers have introduced firearms on
this planet i have been practicing with a pistol i like
the weapon and i know how to use it if we use
pistols we are equally matched my superior size and
consequent strength do not then give me an advantage
you told me once that you were accustomed to handling
a pistol if that statement is true i call upon you to
prove it

  there was a hint of coldness in the giants voice
as if he thought that lee had lied about his ability to use
a pistol lee shrugged hi shoulders very well if
you wish i shall have to be furnished with a pistol

  one of the domns produced two pistols not at all
unlike the automatics of the earth they were identical
in appearance hegave one to meriden and one to lee

  you will stand at opposite sides of the room said
xavian each pistol contains three bullets no more
should be necessary we the judges and witnesses will
be in the adjoining room watching you through a win-
dow of unbreakable glassite which enables us to observe
you in safety i shall fire one blank shot which will be
audible through the glassite after that you may fire
at will observing this condition the walls are forty
zots apart or in earth-measure about seventy feet
neither of you is permitted to go more than four zots
or about seven feet from his respective wall unless the
pistol is dropped to the floor signifying that no attempt
to shoot will be made


amazing stories

  the walls are of steel the bullets of lead will
flatten against them there is little danger of a bullet
rebounding or ricocheting if either of you should
happen to be wounded as a result of such an accident
the other is obliged to cease firing may you conduct
yourselves with honor

  lee walked to his wall taking a position about six
feet from it meriden established himself at the other
end of the room directly opposite the judges left the
room soon becoming visible though the large glassite
panel in one side-wall xavian was seen speaking a min-
ute with burton boyd and the three brothers who seemed
to be meridens seconds then he raised his pistol and
fired the blank cartridge the report was plainly audible
through the glassite

  immediately meriden raised his automatic and fired
one shot

  never in lee chiltons life had anything come so
close to him without actually touching him as did that
first bullet of meriden it passed within one inch of
his head just above his left ear to flatten on the wall
behind him lee heard it strike and drop to the floor

  lee admired the giants fine sportsmanship in spite
of the fact that he had never seen a pistol a month before
the giant was trying to inflict a clean painless death by
a shot through the brain rather than take the easier aim
of a body shot that unless it were actually through the
heart would bring death only after suffering the head
is a small target at seventy feet compared to the body

  lee did not return the shot there was no hurry
the giant was aiming again more carefully instinc-
tively lee sensed the second that meriden was to pull
the trigger and stepped aside the bullet missed him
by three feet this time meriden had one shot left lee
could see that same half-smile on the giants lips one
shot left very slowly without the least emotion or
nervousness meriden was lifting his pistol again lee
had not lifted his

  suddenly the vision of laura ives rose in lees mind
for the first time in his life lee chilton understood what

real fear was he struggled to prevent his fear from
manifesting itself to the giant and the watchers meri-
den had one shot left and the giant was so devilishly
cool about it

  behind the transparent panel burton boyd gasped
chilton was calmly taking three chances with death if
he won the giant would be at his mercy if he lost   

  meriden fired again and missed by a very small frac-
tion of a zot lee chilton dropped his loaded pistol and
walked toward the giant the watchers did not move
meridens expression did not change lee came close to
him

  i have my code of honor too said lee chilton of
the earth i cannot shoot you if you would like to
continue with swords   

  the others were entering meridens half-smile grew
deeper you are worthy of her lee chilton never
before have i seen a man take three such chances with
death for the sake of friendship however great i wish
you happiness

  the giant held out his hand lee took it without a
word

  burton boyd had picked up the gun that lee had
dropped had brought it with him as he approached the
two the giant spoke again to lee

  i told you once earthman that i was sincere in my
love for her the realization that she could not be
happy with me came slowly it hurt me but it was
her happiness i wished above all i trust you to make
her happy for the sake of friendship do not fail me

  the same inscrutable smile played around the giants
lips he took lees unused pistol from the hand of bur-
ton boyd at the opposite end of the room seventy feet
away were three tiny marks in the steel wall where
meridens three bullets had hit three marks each the
size of a thumbnail at seventy feet

  without apparent aim the swordsman of sarvon lifted
the pistol in his hand and fired three shots in as many
seconds each of those three bullets struck the exact
center of one of the three marks

 by eando binder

      fur continued experiments in radio and television may play a much more
      important part in the eventual realization of successful interplanetary travel
      than we can possibly conceive of right now but if we stop a moment to
      think about it the possibilities of such closely allied work between radio tele-
      vision and rocket travel take on vast proportions-one phase of which is vividly
      portrayed in this short science fiction gem

  illustrated by morey

             synthetic platinum

the american people have never clamored
for a true detailed account of the arrival of
the first martian yet the event unheralded
and unprecedented though it was was one of
the most important occurrences in human his-
tory his coming was a distinct shock to the whole
world despite the marvelous advances of science from
its birth in  to that date the inconceivable distance
to be traversed the enormous energy required to trans-
port a heavy machine from planet to planet and the all-
powerful force of gravity seemed insurmountable
objects to even the most broadminded and optimistic
thinkers feeble attempts were made even in  to
leave this speck of the universe and soar to other worlds
but constant failures dulled the ardor of those who
wished to connect our world with the others which
acknowledge the same central sun hope flourished
after the almost successful perhaps indeed successful
attempt of four german scientists to soar from the hide-
bound earth who departed in their famous rocket in
 bound for the moon the world is certain that
they never returned unless they landed in some very
remote spot unseen by human eyes and it cannot be
said where they are whether lost in boundless space
alive or dead on the moon or perhaps scattered in min-
ute particles in the infinite again five years later the
globular ship of two intrepid americans vanished from
the earth never to be seen or heard from and during
the period just following the martian signaling several
others were lost and many more crashed although the
fatalities far exceeded these probable successes the hope
of interplanetary travel was still uppermost in our minds
we know now that our failure can be attributed to the
unfortunate lack of radioactive elements and not to the
lack of ingenuity or inventiveness it was only too true

as professor billings stated in  that the only type
of engine which could possibly transport a heavy ma-
chine from our earth to some planet would have to be
the atomic-energy engine which with a minimum of
fuel and the very necessary radioactive element could
develop an unlimited amount of energy

  he even drew plans of the basic principles of such an
engine estimated the amount of radioactive material
needed and worked out the propulsion of the ship the
theory which he advanced to the scientific world was
the direct cause of professor riehms remarkable de-
velopment of transmutation of elements for it was
found upon investigation that at least twenty-five times
the amount of actinium existing in the world would be
needed to send a ship to the moon professor riehm
realizing that the probability of discovering a rich ore
of actinium was too remote to be relied on decided
that transmutation alone was the keynote to this baffling
problem

  his first great wrork was to break down the ordinary
platinum of commerce to iso-platinum  in other
words he made a variety of platinum with a specific
gravity of  it consequently had a lower melting
point a lower specific heat and higher atomic volume
for a full understanding of this one must review the
past of science a wonderful stairway of facts and truths
leading to truth enthroned

  prout back in the days of the dawn of science for-
mulated the theory that elements were aggregates of the
hydrogen atom and hence every atomic weight should
come out exactly and without fractions or very nearly
even his contemporaries all able men examined care-
fully the then existing list of elements and although a
surprising number came out very close to whole numbers
a good many were halfway between

  stas a german then proceeded to redetermine the
atomic weights and came to the conclusion that prout

our universal-power flashlights lit
up the interior of the globe suffused
by a greenish glow from the reflec-
tion of things made of a certain
metal   
the first martian



was wrong for no matter how carefully done chlorine
always came out  and several others too showed
an uneven atomic weight with full allowance for experi-
mental error this marked the doom of prouts hypo-
thesis and he died in the belief that he had failed to re-
veal to the world a great truth because of the bigoted
beliefs and inaccurate work of stas as it chanced
both were right stas had done his work admirably well
and yet prouts theory was not a mere dream for
early in this century a series of brilliant spectroscopic
experiments proved that many in fact most of the ele-
ments were mixtures of bodies chemically alike but
each having a whole number atomic
weight

  for instance aston the investigator found that tin
was composed of no less than eight isotopes whose
atomic weights are as follow     
   each of these iso-elements is chemically
identical with all the others but possessed each of vary-
ing specific gravities it will be noticed that two of the
isotopes are actually greater in atomic weight than anti-
mony  the element following tin no doubt
one or two of the isotopes of antimony they have not
yet been investigated thoroughly are identical in atomic
weight with one or two of tin

  the average of all the isotopic weights of any one
element with due regard to their relative proportions
gives the present value for the atomic weight for as
yet beyond a very limited number we have not been
able to separate the isotopes of many elements

  we shall now after this short digression be able
better to understand professor riehms remarkable ex-
periment whereby he made iso-platinum  let us
read from his account of the transmutation

  -it was found that platinum was composed of the

following isotopes    and  isotope 
has a he helium proton  a he-h hydro-
gen proton  a he-h proton and  a
he-h proton the problem now resolved itself
into this to remove by a sufficiently powerful agency the
excess hydrogen protons of isos   and  leav-
ing isos  and 

  ordinary chemical reactions have no effect on the
proton of course so some more powerful agency was
needed we tried radium with no effect nor even radon
radium emanation which is hard to isolate and hard to
handle but extremely more radioactive finally we
used actinium no  with success-

  our apparatus was merely a thick-walled cylinder of
lead yt meter long whose ends tapered to points with
openings at each point-a large one at one end and a
small one at the other in the large end was placed in
a built-in receptacle the specimen of platinum to be
altered in the other end we suspended a milligram
of actinium quite a powerful agency in making the
preparations my assistants and myself wore lead-lined
suits and helmets with goggles of lead glass actinium
is much more powerful than radium and a milligram is
decidedly deadly to a man if he works with it for any
length of time while unprotected from its penetrating
gamma rays

  using a cube of platinum at first we had no success
we bathed it in different ether rays while the gamma
rays from the actinium acted upon it no results-
powdered platinum was the solution known as platinum
black after the hour was up we removed the platinum

black no physical change being apparent but to our
great joy upon weighing it a loss of weight showed that
we had increased the proportion of isotope  by about
 subsequent trials with refined apparatus and
more exact methods of procedure yielded specimens of
almost pure iso-platinum  and  which are easily
separated by the difference of their melting points

  the announcement to the scientific world of this
astounding feat aroused long controversy and numerous
conjectures the international science group of paris
asked for a specimen of professor riehms iso-platinum
 and upon examining it carefully announced to the
world that the great german had indeed produced the
isotope of platinum of atomic weight  exactly it
was the spring of  already at this time several
scientists suggested that the law of definite proportions
be declared null and void but the actual act did not go
into force till  when delande made five different
chlorides of tin of the same formula

transmutation

we will skip the intervening years from  to
 during which time several isotopes of differ-
ent elements were isolated in small quantities by various
investigators and return to professor riehm in his
boston laboratory a big american firm had induced
him to work solely for them for an enormous compensa-
tion he moved from berlin to boston and continued
his experiments in one of the best-equipped laboratories
ever built here it was that he and hisassistants broke
down a series of elements and iso-elements including
zinc which was broken down into the non-metal sulphur
the process was kept a secret and all we know even to-
day is that some powerful radioactive body other than
actinium was used with however practically the same
apparatus as that for the making of iso-pt 

  the decomposing or more modernly the isoprotiz-
ing of zinc into sulphur was of more interest to the
scientific world than to the industrial world for which
he labored but the big men behind knew that sooner or
later would come their chance sometime professor
riehm would discover a process that would enrich them
immensely that was why they lured him away from
berlin where he had been working in the interests of
pure science and business men seldom make a mistake
it came in a mild way when out of barium professor
riehm made silver the raw products were barium
chloride a very cheap salt and certain radio-elements
and the final product was silver in the form of ingots
with hydrogen chloride gas as a valuable by-product the
big firm immediately began turning out electrical instru-
ments with silver replacing the copper for a conducting
medium and inside of five years copper as an electrical
conductor was unheard of silver being far superior to
it in more ways than one

  had this been done back in the early part of the cen-
tury when some countries were on a silver standard and
all countries used it for currency there would have been
a world panic but in  when money was all paper
based on real estate no ill effects resulted

  professor riehm spent the rest of his active days
in perfecting various processes for the giant concern

  	actinium itself produces no radiation of any kind but it suffer con-
tinual inter-protonic rearrangement constantly forming actinium a iso-
tope of polonium which immediately breaks down into actinium b
isotope of lead which gives off very powerful gamma raye


amazing stories

which owned him it is indeed sad that such a brilliant
mind became enmeshed in the tentacles of big business
no one knows what he might have done what great
advancement the world might have known if he had
followed the guiding-star of pure science in his berlin
laboratory however there were others of brilliant
mind to carry on the great work

  four years later in  dr svens sprang into
prominence by building up platinum or synthesiz-
ing it from lower elements

  professor riehm had done two outstanding things he
had made possible the isolation of isotopes which is a
partial transmutation and three years later he made
transmutation a reality rather than a hypothetical word
by isoprotizing zinc transmutation as professor riehm
had left it could be done only in the breaking-down way
and then only if the atom split exactly in two as
iso-zinc  into two of iso-sulphur  but dr svens
introduced to science the process of synthesizing elements
this produced a stir in scientific circles equal to that
produced when perkins synthesized mauve the first
aniline dye back in the early days of science

  dr svens notes are written in too technical a style
for clarity to the average reader suffice it to say that
three atoms of iso-iron  plus one atom of iso-alumi-
num  in protonic union gives one atom of iso-platinum
 there are exactly enough hydrogen and helium
protons and free electrons to make normal platinum of
atomic weight  but thirteen free electrons had to be
transferred from the outer shells or orbits to the
nucleus this was the task which dr svens had taken
upon himself working upon this principle that three
parts by atomic-measure of iso-iron  purified by pro-
fessor riehms process plus one part of iso-aluminum
 would give one part of iso-platinum  he subjected
the correct proportions of the lower metals to various
radioactive radiations with no success whatsoever the
metals were finely ground and carefully mixed every
radioactive material procurable was tried and still con-
stant failure resulted it was not until a small amount
of iso-pt  was mixed with the raw products that
success came the yield was however poor after dis-
solving out of the fused mass the unchanged iron and
aluminum by boiling hydrochloric acid a small amount
of iso-pt  was found running to  of the total
weight

  small as the yield was the materials were cheap and
several great chemical concerns took over dr svens
process and put synthetic platinum on the market at one-
third the price of natural platinum this was a great
boon to the chemists who found it thus easier to procure
the much-needed platinum

  dr svens in his laboratory up in northern sweden
next attempted the production of artificial actinium he
had heard about professor billings and his famous
atomic-engine theory and his estimation of the amount
of actinium needed to run it imbued with the grand
purpose of conquering space and establishing communi-
cation wifh mars which he knew was inhabited by
reason of the period of signaling a decade before and
perhaps other planets he began that series of famous
experiments which culminated in the production of
svenium the wonder-metal of today a radioactive body
at least  times more powerful than any natural
material he reached the grand goal which professor
riehm had set before himself but never attained

  but as it chanced before dr svens perfected his
process the first martian landed on earth up in north-
ern michigan near the shores of lake superior this
landing occurred three months after the making of iso-
pt  in  and just about the time that svens began
his work on synthetic actinium undismayed by the
crashing of his hopes of first conquering space he
labored on and in  he announced success-success
beyond his dreams he not only made actinium but also
element  an alkali metal and so radioactive that its
period ie half its life is three minutes he was not
able to isolate it but found that when alloyed with
actinium it became much longer lived and still capable
of producing enormous energy-products he made by
dint of much labor a large supply of the alloy which
subsequently became known as svenium or more popu-
larly the wonder metal and offered it to the mars
klan of which he was a member

  in a short time the ship built by the mars klan and
propelled by the wonder metal rose into the air and
leaving behind the shouts and mad acclaim of admiring
thousands sped to mars equipped with powerful engines
and staunchly built to withstand space conditions

  it was somewhat surprising that after the landing of
the pioneer or the first martian no martian ships
immediately followed the next one to arrive here came
a week after dr svens ship had left earth in fact as
it later proved the martian ship had left mars on the
same day our ship the tellurian had left earth but
the tellurian made the journey in less time than did
the martian ship hence the first official spaceship
from earth arrived on mars before her first official the
pioneer was a lone flyer whose departure from mars
was witnessed by only one person ship reached earth
and then the handicaps we had to overcome the
martians had abundant supplies of radioactive bodies
and needed but to invent the atomic-energy engine while
we had to make our actinium after long years of intense
research the fruit of perhaps  years of scientific ad-
vance

  the principle of the atomic engine was discovered
on earth before the fuel to run it was found on mars
the fuel was there for the taking

martian superiority

if this account reaches the eyes of martians and may
seem to them rather boastful and impertinent i give
them this reason i have written spaceship this in answer
to markin lavlos book martian superiority it is
merely a gentle reminder that beyond the remarkable
flight of the first martian we tellurians can claim to
be the pioneers of space

  it must not be thought that we of earth in any way
minimize the great and historical space flight of the
pioneer far from it we are as quick in our homage
to his dead body and everlasting spirit in the museum
at the spot of landing as his fellow-martians themselves

  the foregoing has prepared the reader for the story
of the arrival of kastory impan the first martian or
the pioneer whose name is held today in reverence by
the peoples of two great worlds

  there are numerous other accounts of the arrival but
none have gone back into the past to show the connec-
tion between scientific research in transmutation and
interplanetary flight a point i think directly connected
the first martian



to the first space flight and subsequent establishment of
commercial relationship it is true that without the
flight of dr svens ship the earth would still be as far
ahead the martians would still have come but that does
not detract from the honor and glory forever associated
with the names of professor wilhelm riehm the
founder of the science of transmutation and dr jarl
svens who developed it i challenge martia the super-
race of mars to bring up a scientist to compare with
either of these two

  and i may add that quite by accident i came across
the little sub-plot which goes with story of the arrival of
the first martian im certain no one ever heard of
gregory stewart before

the arrival

upon the gently-sloping greensward in the shadow
of the forested first bluff one of the myriads of
peaks of the porcupine mountain range just a few
miles outside of the small town of bessemer in the year
of  a group of holiday picnickers were startled
from their merrymakings to see descending near them
with sickening speed a dull green-hued sphere appear-
ing high in the air as a balloon it rapidly increased in
size and when about a hundred feet above the ground
stopped wabbled uncertainly and then crashed to the
ground with a metallic crackling sound after swaying
back and forth slightly it finally came to a dead rest
so startling was this incident that it deprived the merry-
makers of all action in attitudes of astonishment they
gazed speechless at the strange object hardly knowing
what to expect next with excited exclamations the
impetuous youths of the group ran towards it

  ill bet its another of those crazy planetary ships
yelled one excitedly they try em by the dozens now-
adays

or else its a new perpetual-motion air glider

  or maybe its a new raiding plane from the chinese
chimed in a third breathless from running

  well whatever it is came from a fourth the in-
ventor or whoever runs it is sure gone

  upon the heels of the racing youths each eager to be
first followed the elders and the children all thoughts
of their tasty lunch lying on the sward forgotten
surrounding the globe upon their approach they did
not know what to make of it for it was such a strange-
looking object one of the boys in his curiosity ad-
vanced close and touched its metallic side but quickly
withdrew his hand with a cry of pain and sucked his
scorched fingers being in diameter about ten feet it
looked like nothing more than a huge glass ball tinted
with a light green of smooth unseamed surface no
opening of any kind could be discerned in the area of
the spheres surface except that the bottom side on
which it had landed seemed to have been crushed and
the jagged edge buried in the earth no sound could be
heard from the interior of the globe and the excited
picknickers chattered volubly conjecturing and gesticula-
ting trying to make something out of the puzzle

  one of the older men voiced the opinion that it seemed
to have been cast as a whole and that seemed an impos-
sibility to him

  why look  he cried if its some sort of an airship
how could the driver get into it ive just walked all
around it and i cant see a door

  it must be on the underside his companion a
younger man replied just our luck too or we could
have entered and seen whats what if theres anybody
in there and there surely must be unless its radio con-
trolled hell die-if he isnt already dead

  here louie he called to a boy run to the high-
way and see if you can find a motorcopper he turned
to the other man i guess thats all we can do till he
comes mr boldt

  it occurs to me said mr boldt to the other whose
name was ramson that that metal doesnt look like
metal it looks more like glass of course it cant be
that or it would be smashed to hits

  it landed with enough force to snap steel said
ramson but this stuff seems to be intact except where
it struck the earth he bent down and looked closely
at the smashed portion of the huge globe in fact the
only place it did smash is where it landed on a large
rock which you can just see there he pointed over
on the other side it merely depressed the ground

  a third man joined them there is a door to the
thing he cried come on ill show you he led
the way to the other side there right above our
heads you can see the crack which separates it from the
wall its flush with the surface and looks like a perfect
fitting

  it was indeed the door about four feet long and two
feet wide and indistinguishable except for the fine
cracks separating it from the main wall of the globe
it was evident that the sole means of opening it was
from the inside-inside where perhaps someone lay
hurt or dead it was the usual thing for unsuccessful
rockets and spaceships to either smash to pieces on re-
turning or to land so lightly that the occupant or occu-
pants escaped unscathed and stepped smiling out of
their temporarily-disabled ship

  at that moment a man came hurrying up easily recog-
nized as a farmer by the spotless white suit and wide-
brimmed straw hat he arrived breathless

  what in heavens name has happened here what
-whose-why hello mr ramson i thought youd be
here the farmer said as he spied his friend did you
bring this along

  lord no mr chaws i had enough to do carrying
lunch it landed just as we were eating too i cant
make it out i figure its some fellows invention on its
maiden voyage and it was evidently built for space

flight my friends here- he proceeded to introduce

them

  mr chaws was introduced as manager of section d
of the well-known brinkley farm whose products al-
ways sold well in big-city markets in extent about
ocx acres its various sections were scattered on
both sides of the porcupine range section d bordered
the other side of the woods near which the picnickers
had started to eat lunch and specialized in dairying
more than grains mr chaws himself was one of the
regular college-bred scientific farmers who are trained
in our large agricultural institutes

  i was just stepping out of the milking-room of barn
 began mr chaws all introductions over when
raising my eyes for some reason i saw this-ship-as a
rather large ball high in the air its peculiar color and
apparent speed of descent made me watch it curiously
as it drew nearer it rapidly increased in size and at
first i thought it was going to land near me but instead


amazing stories

it disappeared from my sight as it fell behind first
bluff determined to find out what it was i jumped
into my cremson and motored over here as fast as i
could through the woods i parked the car over on the
road i fully expected to see a mass of broken metal

here instead of this-

  well you see broke in mr boldt whoever runs
the machine succeeded in halting it about a hundred
feet above ground and then lost control again

  its all heated up ejaculated mr ramson at least
on the outside even if the fall didnt kill the pilot of
this-ship-then the heat will-or has

  isnt there some way of opening it and getting the
fellow out asked mr chaws

  doesnt seem to be exclaimed mr ramson look
heres the door and he pointed with meaning at the
only evident means of egress and entrance

  hm-no chance there spoke mr chaws about
all we can do is send for a motorcopper and let him
worry

  ive done that already cried mr ramson if there
was one on the highway when the boy got there he ought
to be here now but theyre never where theyre needed
most all the men smiled for at that time the motor-
coppers had very indefinite schedules as compared with
the present strict system

  of all the places to land this is the worst com-
mented mr chaws three miles from a town ten
miles from the nearest airport and confound it all-i
think its going to take a hydrotorch to open that thing
when it cools enough to work near it added mr
boldt significantly in fact all the people kept at a
comfortable distance from the huge globe which radi-
ated quite an amount of heat

  i pity the poor fellow in there if hes still alive
its as bad as a miner twenty feet from safety pinned
down by a rock across his leg spoke mr chaws quietly
if we could only get a hose connected up and sprinkle
it with water

  to get his machine so heated up by atmospheric
friction he must have been speeding at a good fast clip
or perhaps hes been falling from away up exclaimed
mr boldt

  when that rocket-ship those three engineers navi-
gated last year to  miles up came back as a freely-
falling body the remains of the ship were hardly as hot
as this is this fellow must have come from a good
deal higher-and faster said mr ramson only it
would not get hot in empty space

  from the roadway that led through the woods ap-
peared the figure of a motorcopper resplendent in his
blue uniform and leather leggings he strode up look-
ing curiously at the globular green-hued ship unaware
of the connection his name would have in the future with
one of the most important events in earthly and martian
history

  stopping a few yards away he looked sharply at the
object and whistled softly

  looks like the real thing he said in a loud voice
but why didnt it get there and he pointed to the
moon every space-adventurer or group of them an-
nounced their destination as the moon to the admiring
crowds before the take-off and reaching the moon
was a standing joke and likewise a proverb in those days

  my names steelstrong he exclaimed as he turned
to mr chaws and the others whats it all about

  all the former picknickers had clustered together and
one and all looked at mr chaws as if appointing him
speaker in terse sentences mr chaws told his part of
the story mr ramson continued and emphasized the
fact that it would take a hydrotorch to open the mysteri-
ous object and get in to rescue the pilot of the ship

  wheres the door asked mr steelstrong it was
pointed out to him and surveying it carefully he turned
to mr ramson youre right its a space-built ship
and the door is an air-tight affair i wonder what kind
of engine he could possibly have to lift a spherical ship

off the ground-it doesnt look like a rocket-ship-

  hardly that maybe this fellow has perfected some
sort of gravity-screen or nullifier exclaimed mr boldt

  if so hes done something that scientists have striven
to do for a long time said mr chaws

  mr ramson had been all the while examining the
juncture of the ship and the ground he straightened
up i think it is a rocket-ship after all look-see that
flange almost buried in the earth i believe thats part
of the circumference of his rocket-discharge tube
quite possible answered the motorcop but the
shape of the craft is hardly that of a rocket-ship they
are usually elongated with the discharge tube at one end
of course the shape of a rocket-ship does not matter in
the least out in mid-space as long as it has a weighted
side

  possessed of all details the motorcop pulled out of his
pocket the tiny but efficient radio-transmitter such as is
in common use today at that time used mainly by offi-
cials policemen motorcops and the like in a few mo-
ments the little instrument powered by universal-energy
made connections and the attendant at headquarters an-
swered

  mr steelstrong reported in a casual voice little real-
izing how his words would be read by millions of eager
people later- there is a strange metallic glassy-
like spherical ship or machine piloted by some unknown
person which landed three miles northeast of bessemer
some ways off the bristow highway near first bluff
it landed  on the date so well remembered by the
peoples of two worlds according to some twenty eye-
witnesses no means are at hand to enter the ship to
rescue the pilot for not only is it too hot to approach
but the only door is locked from the inside to all appear-
ances i advise sending a public-utilities crew over im-
mediately with a hydrotorch to cut an entrance

  the motorcop snapped off the handy little transmitter
and engaged in a calm talk with mr chaws mr ram-
son and mr boldt although all knew there might be a
badly-bruised possibly suffocating perhaps dead person
in the green glass-like sphere strangely out-of-place
where it rested on the brown earth and while the pub-
lic-utilities crew is speeding with all possible haste in a
universal power car to the scene of the landing of the
pioneer all unconscious of their part in the making of
history let us turn our attention to a person intimately
connected with all this and yet about whom very little
is known

signaling from mars

as early as i people had reported strange intelli-
gent-sounding signals coming through on the car-
rier-waves of distant stations especially on wave-lengths
of around  meters the signaling gradually be-
i

the first martian



came more persistent and the public began complaining
of the increasing disturbance comparable to the one-
time dreaded static the government slow to act as
usual did nothing about it until there was nothing left
to do it was voiced about gradually that some fanatic
with a grudge against the whole world was bent on
spoiling radio entertainment the greatest means of
uniting and educating people there was and still is tele-
vision remained undisturbed but it was provoking when
listening to some foreign station on a high wave to have
an intermittent dot-dashing break in as a background
to the singing and talking

  considerable excitement was created when a world-
renowned amateur in experimenting with new hook-ups
devised one capable of receiving waves of as long as-
 meters double the longest in common use he
reported the bothersome signals as very strong at 
meters and said he planned to trace the waves to their
source and possibly lead to the capture of the fiend who
was creating them as an outcome of this a number of
radio-experts got together for the common good of all
and for the sake of radio-science and adopting the
principle of the great amateurs circuit built an efficient
receiver capable of close to  meters reception

  at first trial the set proved a success for the purpose
for which it had been built the signaling came in loud
and distinct and was found to be simply dash-double
dash-triple dash-etc up to ten then combinations
such as dot dash-dot dash dot-dot dash dash dot-
etc and again dot dash-double dot double dash-
triple dot triple dash-etc after a long series of such
signaling there would be a short pause and then the
whole thing over again

  really puzzled the group of amateurs prepared a
direction-finder attachment in the attempt to locate the
diabolical fiend who tampered with the ether-rights of
citizens of the world the results of this showed the
signals to be moving  actually moving curiously at a
rate of speed equal to the earths rotation at times
the waves came from china straight through the earth
the group had headquarters near new york city and
at other times from straight above as if reflected from
the heaviside layer

  no progress was made till an enterprising young
astronomer of the group of experimenters conceived
the idea of listening to the signals and observing mars
in a telescope at the same time he his name lies shame-
fully in obscurity today discovered the explanation of
the periodic flashes on mars for the signals and the
flashes corresponded down to the smallest detailed dot

  it was announced to the world that the martians for
who or what else could it be were atempting to com-
municate with the earth by means of a powerful direc-
tional radio-wave and large visible flashes today we
know these flashing lights which must have been
enormous in area to have been produced by a compli-
cated apparatus whose vitals were radioactive substances
which mars is singularly blessed with in immense quan-
tities the period of signaling lasted with several
breaks till  or seven long years-a strong indication
of the well-known martian persistency

  various theories sprang up back in  regarding the
purpose of the signaling some claimed the martians
merely wanted to let us know they were living having
found out somehow or had they that the earth was
inhabited by rational beings there was no doubt that

the earth was the object of their signaling for assuming
that the wave was a directional one and it is the only
possible conception considering the enormous distance
we know the waves to have followed the earth in its
movements

  the theory gradually gained ground that the signaling
was a warning from the martians that they were about
to launch ships to the earth in fact said some it might
be taken as declaration of war when the pioneer
landed in  eleven years after the signaling so sud-
denly stopped many people said its coming was the mes-
sage conveyed by the martian signals but we know to-
day the two events had no connection the martians
having means at hand were imbued with the idea of
making a simple gesture at interspace communication
one-sided though it be one thing is certain it had a
most important effect on the affairs of this world

space flying period

the one great result of the martian signaling was
to start an era of planetary ship-building which
gradually died away to normal in  the people
of the world seemed to become electrified by the startling
news that rational beings who understood radio and
optics lived on another and similar world some few
million miles away minds before dormant were
dragged out of the rut of the commonplace and geniuses
were born and died in the space of a week mars mar-
tians interspace communication light minutes light sec-
onds acceleration initial speed super-steel such expres-
sions were on every ones tongue young inventors old
hair-brained fanatics unproved lindberghs self-
appointed areonauts and pseudo-engineers began design-
ing and trying out spaceships space-flyers rocket ships
speed bullets ether planes anti-gravity screens and what
not else in the attempt to be first to tell the martians
how glad we were to acknowledge them our neighbors
almost daily martyrs left the earth in imposing ships
having promised to send greetings from wife and child
neighbors and friends to the first martians he saw on
an average of once a week some inventor or pioneer
came to a sudden death in his self-built ship or soared
into space never to return never to arrive anywhere
victims of misbegotten ideas the more rational people
had no check on the enthusiastic ones who left all and
everything to carry earthly tidings to distant mars
professor billings theory that space-travel was only
possible in an atomic-energy engine with more actinium
than the world had was totally disregarded by these
fanatics and opinionated ones

  this country held its breath when a former-famed
engineer embarked in a truly imposing rocket ship and
soared grandly into space one summers day it took
him a minute and a half to go  miles up and a min-
ute and a half or perhaps longer to go back and they
couldnt even find his body down in the bottom of the big
pit which marked the landing of the ship loaded with
several tons of markite a new and powerful explosive

  but youth is impetuous and his spectacular flight served
rather to stimulate than check the mad tide of would-be
space flyers ambassadors to mars

  in the meantime dr svens and others worked quietly
ahead to the goal in sight the synthetic production of
actinium so greatly needed for the atomic engine-
and so rare their success in transmuting lower ele-


amazing stories

ments into a higher one platinum came about three
years after the sudden decline in activity in space-flying
attempts calmly assured that the production of syn-
thetic actinium was but a matter of development he
forged ahead determined to do in a scientific way what
so many foolish people had attempted in other ways
the coming of the first martian was a blow but he
accepted it philosophically and perhaps realized that the
success of the pioneer was due more to chance than to
martian science

  an era of wildcat speculation far transcending that
of the civil war period set in and the gullible public
bought worthless stock from convincing and voluble pro-
fessional sharks for martian-earthian freight lines
inter-space express cos and planetary service lines
etc

  to enhance their sales certain combines of the sharks
put up signs and billboards

  this marks the spot where the great martian space
port will be built reliable backing buy stock now
and realize millions before a years time and accom-
panying it would be a vivid florid picture of a gigantic
space-ship or perhaps a grotesque martian beckoning
and ifrging

  but even as in former times reliable companies sprang
up to really promote the project the common populace
had a fling and when they had spent themselves science
stepped in

  a scientific convention met at moscow in  and
formed a body which was pledged

  to establish inter-space travel and communication be-
tween our inhabited neighbor mars and the earth for
the betterment of science and the good of the public

  the body became a strictly scientific organization and
the charter members after drawing up a series of regu-
lations which included very strenuous requirements for
membership opened their doors to all who were inter-
ested who could satisfactorily prove their worth in
time the organization became known as the mars klan
and absorbed a number of efficient engineers and mech-
anicians astronomers and in fact recruits from every
branch of science but it is doubtful if the klan would
have made good if it hadnt gathered into its folds dr
svens the one person responsible for the success of their
plans

  work was begun in earnest the following year dr
svens promised to produce actinium within a decade the
engineers worked together on the construction of the
tellurian which after making six flights to mars and
back was placed in the moscow museum where it rests
today viewed daily by thousands it embodied of
course the original plans as made by professor billings
back in  altered as modern discoveries made neces-
sary and was fully constructed almost a year before dr
svens perfected his synthetic actinium process in 
the laboratory constructed by the mars klan was rated
as the best in the world at the time the astronomers
also had their part to do to dig up and record some 
years of painstaking data on mars and all features of
mars and also to study with renewed intensity the planet
through telescopes all in all much valuable experi-
mental work was done before the actual accomplishment
of their aims and a great deal of by-product results was
filed away for future use and in the midst of all this
like a prophesy came the arrival of kastory impan the
first martian

gregory stewart

when the motorcop spoke into his little short wave
transmitter to report to headquarters of the land-
ing of a strange green-hued sphere he did not know the
furore he caused in the mind of a certain man seated
at the dials of his short-wave set it had been more or
less of a puzzle to the motorcop and the crew who came
at his call why almost immediately after their arrival
the heads of the ironwood laboratory branch  of the
federal laboratory also came up in a universal-power
car the scientists spoke of a mysterious call from
someone who in a voice of anguish told them a martian
the first martian had arrived on earth at first bluff
near bessemer begging them to hurry because he was
probably badly hurt the writer of this article suc-
ceeded in piecing together the scattered facts after con-
siderable trouble and revealing the little drama behind
the arrival of the pioneer

  a middle-aged quiet and quite well-to-do eccentric
had bought a small brick house just on the northern edge
of bessemer and therein had established a small experi-
mental radio laboratory small insignificant and un-
obtrusive people had after the usual run of gossip
almost completely forgotten him in fact that made it
doubly hard to secure the necessary information about
his activities as no one knew of them he simply had
no friends

  he had listened steadily and eagerly to the martian
signals at the time of their occurrence and had for the
purpose built himself a long-wave set copied from the
invention of the famous amateur who made possible
radio reception from mars after the martians had so
suddenly ceased broadcasting in  this experimenter
gregory stewart put the useless set aside and turned
back to his old field short-wave experimenting in
 he left for europe apparently to satisfy a wander-
lust from then he traveled to different regions of the
globe erratically skipping from city to city and place to
place his wanderlust satisfied he returned to the
laboratory in bessemer and began work on an incom-
pleted report vhich the writer has procured on the ef-
fects of the hu iside layer on radio waves it is pos-
sible almost certain that completion of this work would
have made broadcasting to mars an accomplished thing
before the adoption of martian long-wave methods it is
safe to identify the reception of strange signals on mars
from time to time after  with the efforts of this
obscure man whose apparatus however was found
completely demolished it is surmised the martian sig-
naling had imbued him with the desire to retaliate

  but night after night as he glanced now and then at
the old high wave set an irresistible impulse grew with-
in him a hunch more or less that the martians would
some time recommence signaling perhaps in answer to
his efforts to reach them at last almost driven to dis-
traction by haunting thoughts of missing it when it came
this is gleaned from his incomplete and erratic diary
he devised a scheme whereby should the martians re-
establish broadcasting to earth on the old wave length
about  meters he would be notified by the flashing
of a small light in an open circuit he had revised a
crystal set and along with the high-wave design had in-
serted a very sensitive heat-indicator and connected it to
the break in the light circuit if at any time the signals
from mars came again the crystal sensitized to it by
the first martian



the high-wave design would send a minutely weak and
absolutely unhearable impulse through a coil surround-
ing the heat indicator this heat indicator was the heart
of the whole scheme several years back an investi-
gator had perfected a thermo-electric globe made of a
secret metal which in response to the slightest amount
of radio-heat i e the border line waves between heat
and radio waves would close an electric circuit the
coil surrounding it produced this necessary radio-heat
impulse when the signals came and as a result the cir-
cuit would be closed lighting the small lamp and the
observer would be appraised of the signaling he would
then simply have to connect up his big set and tune in
several times the light had momentarily flashed but at
no time had there been a permanent and lasting broad-
cast probably some accidental effect of earthly experi-
menters

  but one night it happened in a trice the man await-
ing just this occurrence had hooked up the big set
although his hands trembled so he dropped the ear-
phones twice his astonishment may be imagined when
he heard instead of signals a voice true a strange
and muffled voice but nevertheless they were articula-
tions of a rational being it is possible that the man
ecstatically drank in the triumph of first hearing of all
living and of all dead peoples the voice of a martian
in breathless suspense we may imagine him listening
spellbound to a language he could not in the least under-
stand momentarily disconnected with things material
and experiencing a sublime emotion that of being
first to do something

  his diary is especially illuminating at this point
voice that soothes and lulls at least to me curiously
rapid and unhesitatingly as if it took little effort to
formulate few harsh sounds and many graduated
vowel combinations came i am the first human to hear
the voice of a being not of the earth glorious triumph
i am now amply rewarded for my recluse life and it
took no physical prowess god how i hate the thought

- despised and scorned health undermined-

but this is ample reward i could ask no more am i
to become famous nothing i desire more-or less
ill meet him face to face-

  i may add that he struck the right expression when
he said rapid and unhesitating as if it took little effort
to formulate that is the outstanding characteristic of
the spoken martian language

  in the days following he listened to what were evi-
dently long talks or reports to which he could not hear
the answers for which the speaker stopped at times as
he listened night after night and the voice grew louder
and louder it gradually dawned upon him that the mar-
tian was somehow in motion and gradually nearing the
earth

  in a daze the man sat almost continuously by the
receiver  till a report would be ended then most likely
he worked on his great work in the pauses between the
messages as soon as the light flashed however he was
back at the set and indulging again in the soothing
and lulling modulations of the pioneer it never
occurred to him or perhaps he didnt want to do that
to notify the scientists at the ironwood public-service
laboratory but it did occur to him to speak to the
martian he hooked up the set of his invention and
switched on the current no one knows what he said
but probably they were impassioned words of cheer and

welcome and the effect on the martian again from the
diary is given here

  his voice became eager his words more rapid and
although we had no way of understanding each other i
verily believe something in common in our thoughts gave

him hope and comfort and me- later when he

spoke again to whomever on mars was in contact with
him i could almost follow his eager explanations about
me-

  this the writer thinks explains the comparatively
slight excitement when the martians asked who had at-
tempted to communicate with the martian kastory im-
pan during his flight to earth no one had accomplished
such an inconceivable thing as far as anyone knew the
martians were assured but they maintained with their
usual persistency that someone on our earth had spoken
to him while he was yet in mid-space and from then till
his fatal landing

  affairs came to a climax some fate some working
of destiny pointed the ship of the first martian in his
epochal-making flight to the town of bessemer near the
shores of lake superior and very near to the home of
the eccentric radio-enthusiast

  the signals had become extraordinarily loud and the
man basked in delightful thoughts of meeting him he
sat by his set that memorable afternoon of august 
and heard the voice of the martian becoming excited
suddenly his words ceased there was a long and
deathly silence in which the only man cognizant of the
martians arrivau was gripped in a mighty and terrible
dread my very heart stopped beating as i hoped and
prayed for the martian then came a grinding sound
a fearful scream a dull crash and then-dead silence

  we have no record of gregory stewards immediate
reactions to what he knew probably meant death to the
first martian perhaps he fainted anyway the call
his call to the ironwood laboratory came a full hour
after the landing the words of the unknown man who
apprized the scientists of the arrival are indelibly print-
ed in the mind of the operator at the set in the labor-
atory who heard in a tense almost unearthly strained
voiced the following

  in gods name hurry over to first bluff near besse-
mer where a martian has just landed and is probably-
badly-hurt

  it is easily seen that gregory stewart had heard the
report of the motorcop in his low-wave set and so knew
that fate had landed the martian very near to the only
human who-knew of his coming

  thus it was that when the scientists and utilities crew
arrived and carried out the body of kastory impan the
pioneer the first martian there was a small dark
man a glazed look in his weary eyes who hovered in
the background and looked intently at the distorted face
of the martian

kastory impan

the door was cut out as was the only possible
way with a hydrotorch and the piece was lifted
away the head of the utilities crew stepped into the
globe he came out with an expression of bewilder-
ment and turning to the group of five scientists who
had sped over to investigate the truth of the mysterious
call said he believed they were the ones to enter and
bring out the person inside


amazing stories

  let us read the abridged report of this group of men
who were first to look upon the face of the first mar-
tian

  our universal-power flashlights lit up the interior
of the globe suffused by a greenish glow from the reflec-
tion of things made of a certain metal an alloy known
later as martinium the first object to engage our at-
tention was the body of the first martian to arrive on
this earth perhaps four feet long with massive chest
and spindly legs the pioneer lay stretched out on his
thin and wasted face a most frantic look of despair and
fear his fingers were clutched together and his legs
terribly twisted a general angular look about the body
suggested that all his bones were broken carefully we
laid aside the yielding broken body and proceeded to ex-
amine the interior of the ship the interior walls were
covered by a netting of fine wire whose purpose was to
provide heat obtained from electrical energy from a
radioactive battery among the articles in the ship was
a heavy metal box securely attached to the floor-wall
which housed the atomic-energy engine another sknilar-
appearing box nearby was ajar and inside were jars of
a peculiar practically unbreakable glass some of them
containing crust-like substances and others water an
oily liquid and miscellaneous articles fastened securely
to the walls all around were various instruments of deli-
cate and fine make easily recognized as thermometer
clock telescope sextant-like affair an acceleration and
speed recorder altimeter and several seemingly purpose-
less instruments all seemed to have survived the shock
of the impact quite well

  near the body was an apparent radio-set mangled
beyond readjustment and about the only object in the
ship in that condition it was connected by a thin wire
to a metallic rod supported on a wooden base which evi-
dently was the aerial we also observed a television at-
tachment and the reflecting mirror fastened to the wall
in the space between the outer and inner wall was the
compressed air tank which supplied the pilot with pure
air and an outlet with an ingenious valve for eliminat-
ing used air in six different places equidistant from
each other were shutter-like arrangements raising one
of them we looked right through the outer wall into the
woods around first bluff truly a marvelous metal
of which the ship was built

  the body lay half across the radio-set as we found
it our inspection done the body was reverently carried
outside to the eager people and the ship was closed up
and guarded till taken away the next day

  the body of kastory impan lies in state in contrast to
the look of anguish on his face in the bessemer mu-
seum and is a shrine at which thousands daily worship
-and pray 

  the martians we learned later knew absolutely noth-
ing about the flight of the pioneer he and his friend
had built the ship devised the engine the crude fore-
runner of the atomic-engine and fitted it for space-
flight constant communication was kept up between the
two during all the flight and the full story of par-
ticulars was published by the martian who stayed behind
it is therein stated that the reason for his failure to land
successfully was due to the crudeness and incompleteness
of the engine for fuel the martian had used gold a
fairly common metal on mars which yields a high per-
centage of hydrogen volume when broken up by acti-
nium the ship had landed squarely on its rocket-tube

discharge which they had built almost flush with the
outer shell around the discharge tube had been placed
the weighting material gold to keep the tube always
pointing to the planet above which the ship hovered it
is suggested that the martian and his companion had
not made enough allowance for the earths superior
gravity and hence had not enough discharge-force to
land the ship gently

two worlds

oecond martian ship arrived read the startling

  o	headlines of newspapers september  
what had happened to dr svens to our ship the
tellurian had they passed each other on the way
had the tellurian been disabled or lost or smashed into
infinity the turmoil reached proportions almost tran-
scending the space-ship period when everyone had be-
come inspired with the desire to reach mars

  the ten martians who came as official pioneers to
earth knew nothing of our ship they started in fact
on exactly the same day the tellurian left earth if
the dead body of the pioneer kastory impan had been
ogle-eyed and stared at by millions imagine the center
of attraction ten live moving and talking martians must
have been their ship had arrived in europia in the
former country of belgium near antwerp the inter-
national science group of paris immediately traveled
thither en masse and accorded the martians welcome
i will not detail the activities of the martians and our
scientists but suffice it that the visit lasted a full six
months in which time by using joint telepathy and sim-
ple teaching methods the martians were taught english
which was the universal language on earth

  in the meantime the tellurian came back from mars
and the success of their voyage caused every world citi-
zen to expand his chest and look mightily pleased the
two ships were a strange contrast side by side the large
green-hued globular ship from mars made of mar-
tinium and the smaller elongated bright silver earth-
ship both had the identical type of engine but each
was run by different fuels the martians were run by
large amounts of actinium and gold while ours was run
by small amounts of the wonder metal and lead

  after the two successful flights in  space travel
became but a matter of development and enterprise the
martians soon brought us their science in many ways
superior to ours their television which was superior to
ours their persistence and lastly martinium able to
resist heat and cold to all extremes the earth returned
with her imbeciles and invalids headed for the moun-
tains of mars the best sanitariums of the two worlds
as trade became established vast stores of radioactive
minerals gold lead and tin were exported to earth the
last two vying on the market with synthetic lead and tin
successfully developed by professor riehm famous for
all times as the originator of transmutation in turn
the martians imported sodium salts of which they suf-
fered an extreme rarity sulphur and iron at first
considerable numbers of the space freight-ships were
lost some with valuable consignments due to insuffi-
cient fuel or lack of practical data on space travel but
today losses are down to a bare minimum and the
brains of the two worlds have worked in unison to solve
baffling problems only once has trouble loomed on
the horizon of our friendly relationship
the first martian



  in closing let us read a clipping from a newspaper
dated august  

  today a small dark man gregory stewart known
to the people of bessemer as a radio-amateur and hav-
ing a laboratory there startled the people in setters
park by rushing straight to the waters of the lagoon
he shouted as he ran ah god i hear it again

he screams oh-he screams hes lost and holding
his hands to his ears he plunged to his death in the pond
although he was pulled out quickly he could not be
revived

  this little article was hidden in the middle of the
newspaper yet almost all the rest of it dealt with the
arrival of the first martian

space rocket murders

   by edmond hamilton

     continued from page 

they took for let us suppose that when the venerians
first visited earth two hundred years ago they had made
themselves known to the people of earth and had helped
them build space-ships like their own suppose they had
done that fifty years ago-five years ago what would
have been the result 

  would there not have been space-ships sailing from
earth to venus soon crowded with the curious the self-
seeking the restless and when they reached venus
if they found there anything considered of value by men
gold precious stones valuable minerals who can doubt
but that soon more and more ships would have been
sailing venus-ward that the venerians natural resources
would have been ruthlessly exploited and that when the
venerians resisted they would have been fought and
in time wiped out just as here in our own world the
tasmanians and the red indians and a score of other
lower races were annihilated 

  no much as we may dislike to admit it we must con-
fess that the venerians acted for their own best interests
when they deliberately planted spies on earth to retard
and prevent entirely if possible the development of space-
travel by men and from their point of view the few
deaths their course occasioned here on earth would be
well justified by the prevention of the disastrous conse-
quences if man ever did reach venus

  but this lies in the past we know now that the vener-
ians exist and that they have developed a method of space-
sailing we are aware even of the fact that their num-
bers are less than ours though their science is farther
advanced their two hundred years of watch on us
through their spies on earth has been disclosed to us

  parenthetically there is small chance to my mind
that the venerians will attempt to resume this watch
on us i doubt if they will ever again seek to maintain
spies on earth not only because since they have been
once discovered their work would be almost impossible
but also because the object of their watch is gone now
that we know all these things and are fully aware that
venus is a habitable and inhabited world

  no this first secret phase in the relations of venus
and enrth the one planets race being entirely unaware
of th others existence is gone forever the great ques-
tion now is what are the two worlds relations to be in
the future

  it is evident that if the venerians have developed

space-ships we also can do so though perhaps much
time must elapse first but as the scientific knowledge
and power of man marches steadily onward the day
must surely come when man too will take to space and
sail to other worlds when he sails to venus will it be
as an invader or a friend 

  the venerians no doubt believe that he will come
combatively and probably from now on will be busily
preparing weapons with which to resist the hordes of
earth that will someday drop out of the sky many there
will be on earth too who will want to see man go as a
conqueror who will vision an empire of humans extend-
ing from end to end of the solar system from mercury
to pluto

  it may be that their visions will be fulfilled and that
the venerians will go down under a human invasion after
long resistance and their little islands will be peopled
by humancolonists it may be that less-developed races
on other planets will be exterminated also to the greater
glory of humanity certainly there will be many in that
future day who would thrill to the trumpet-call challenge
to bring every planet in our system under the domination
of man

  but there is a chance also that when man does visit
venus and the other worlds it will not be as a conqueror
but as a friend there is a chance that by that time man
will have outgrown his barbaric war-fever that still racks
earth and will have seen it for the childish thing it is
unworthy of a mature race and that chance increases
each day for each day sees us a little farther a tiny little
away from the glory in war for wars sake that formerly
was ours

  so the fears of the venerians may prove vain after
all so the future may bring not a cruel autocracy of
man in the solar system but a friendly peaceful asso-
ciation of the solar systems living worlds with humans
venerians and whatever other races the system may
prove to hold engaged in trade and travel from world
to world

  may this prove indeed to be what the future holds our
solar system that seems now so vast to us is in
reality but a little heated lighted shelter in the cold
black immensities of space

  may we different ones who inhibit it refrain always
from fighting each other and dwell in it in enduring
peace

invasion of 

by j david reid

t tere is a shortt short story of provocative interest not only to those who
are especially interested in chemistry-and there is much of interest to those
who are-but also to those who like to speculate on the chances of our next uni-
versal war which seems almost inevitably to be on its way

of course its all old history now but after
seeing the brief three minutes devoted to it
in my grandsons picture-phono history i
feel that one so intimately connected with
these events as i was should tell something
about the manner in which the united states was saved
from foreign invasion by harvey wilkins back in those
hectic days in  i feel that he should receive a
little more credit than has been given him

  it was in  that harvey wilkins and  were
students and roommates in college he was a sort of
fragile chap with light hair and blue eyes he was a
bit near-sighted and he gave the impression of a rather
small ruffled owl when he peered at you through his
horn-rimmed glasses for all his queer appearance he
was a very friendly sort of fellow as i soon found
out when i became his roommate

  we both majored in chemistry and in all the time
we were together we never quarreled we struggled
through all the various courses together with varying
degrees of success i could handle routine chemical
analyses a trifle better than he could but when it came
to theoretical chemistry he left me far behind

  it was a warm spring morning in  and i was
half asleep in physical chemistry-chem  they called
it-when i noticed harvey next to me was sitting on
the edge of his chair with arapt expression on his face
watching the figures and circles the professor was put-
ting on the blackboard usually we had illustrated pic-
tures and diagrams but this morning the professor had
elected to draw his own

  and very little more is known about this subject
than was known some ten years ago the professor
was saying it has baffled the efforts of all the great
scientists but someday it will be solved undoubtedly
with the solution of this problem will come the emanci-
pation of the world from much of its labor

  when i came home that night i found harvey tre-
mendously excited

  say he began did you listen to the lecture this
morning 

  i was asleep i confessed what was the old duck
raving about

  raving repeated harvey staring at me incredu-
lously-he took his professors very seriously-why
he was talking about the most interesting subject in
chemistry-that is to say in the world he lectured on
atomic disintegration

  pure bunkum i responded rather contemptuously
my interest evaporating at once that is one problem
that will never be solved i left him before he could
start arguing because i knew from past experience that
i would lose any argument on theory with him i would
have to agree whether i believed him or not in order
to get some peace harvey wilkins had a peculiar bull-
dog tenacity that made him never give up an idea that
he was once convinced was practicable

  well things ran on in their usual course and we grad-
uated with our bachelors degree in chemistry it was
just at this time that fate stepped in with a little inci-
dent that probably changed the history of the world
the incident was only a carelessly handled rifle up in the
canadian woods but it resulted in the death of har-
veys multimillionaire uncle when the will was read
it was found that harvey was the sole heir to his uncles
millions harvey was thus enabled to go out west to
arizona-his lungs were weak-and to build himself
a wonderful research laboratory with a corps of as-
sistants and all the apparatus that he wanted of
course he offered me a job but i had already agreed to
go into the government service and he did not urge me

  i worked up from a junior chemist in the government
service until i became a senior chemist then i was
transferred over to work on some cases for the diplo-


the great invasion of 



matic service and i became a permanent fixture there
my chemical training enabled me to take a scientific
view of many things and to give advice that proved
helpful to those who controlled the destinies of the
nation

  in all this time i had not lost track of harvey al-
though i had not seen him since college days i knew
that he was unobtrusively making a name for himself in
radiochemistry i corresponded with him quite fre-
quently so it happened that i knew about his new proc-
ess for extracting radium salts from the ores that was
his first great step toward his goal for it gave him mate-
rial to work on incidentally it brought him fame and
considerably more money

  it was several years after this initial discovery of his
that the events occurred leading up to the great inva-
sion my first intimation of anything unusual was
when i was called into the office of the secretary of war
when i entered he was sitting at his desk frowning and
petulantly hitting the corner of his desk with an ex-
tremely thin piece of metal about six inches by four
when i came into the room he jumped up and stuck
the piece of metal out at me accusingly

  whats that he demanded

  looks like a piece of metal i answered flippantly

  feel it he said

  then it was my turn to gasp the sample was very
light and it had a peculiar greyish sheen to it when i
started to bend it i found to my surprise that although
the little sheet of metal was almost incredibly thin it
resisted my utmost efforts to bend it in some ways it
reminded me of spring steel

  a new alloy i breathed and turned to the secre-
tary eagerly what is it i asked

  he threw up his hand impatiently and sat down
rather wearily

  thats for you to find out he said thats the
most important job weve ever turned over to you

  where did you get it is there some more

  he leaned over his desk and pointed his finger at me
impressively

  young man that little piece of metal has already
cost us the life of two of the best men we ever had
its more dangerous than if it were high explosive and
more valuable to us than if it were made of diamonds

  but why i interrupted is it-

  he waved my interruption aside impatiently

  one of the best spies we ever had got wind of the
fact that something was strange about a little island off
japan he posed as a tourist but was politely but firmly
steered away naturally that only increased his de-
termination to find out what was going on he and
two other men got there in a motor boat and holed up
in a little cove on one end of the island here is the
typewritten report of the operator who survived and
came out with the sample of alloy

  i took the typewritten manuscript rather gingerly i
was used to danger of various sorts but somehow this
seemed to be a sort of cold-blooded affair the man-
uscript ran as follows

report of operator bxv

  this is a resume of recent happenings on island-

the name had been eliminated off the coast of japan
operator bxv was the first to discover the fact that
there was unusual activity on this island and myself and

operator bxv were ordered to report to him with a
large motor boat on the night of june th this we
did as ordered and picked him up after several hours
run we docked in a little rocky cove at the end of the
island the place was deserted and we managed to
conceal our boat leaving bxv on guard bxv
and i went to look over the ground we found that
in the center of the island there was a large plant of
some sort owing to guards we were unable to get
very close but bxv tried it alone when he came
back to me in the early morning he told of a large plant
which he said was engaged in the manufacture of parts
made out of a sort of grey metal he said that the
substance must be incredibly light because he had ob-
served a small japanese pick up an enormous bar of
metal he also said that the metal was made in a
small building that seemed to require an enormous
amount of electric current judging from the dynamos
he said that he would risk getting a piece of it the next
night we spent the day safely hidden and that eve-
ning bxv went after a sample of the queer metal i
accompanied him part of the way and waited for him
most of the night it was early in the morning when
he returned with several soldiers after him he received
a bullet through his lungs but he managed to get to
me he died there but he gave me the piece of metal
i shot two of the soldiers and succeeded in getting
back to the boat bxv had the motor going imme-
diately unfortunately bxv was shot by a soldier
as we were leaving but i managed to get picked up by
a steamer i then managed to get here without mis-
hap i believe that i was traced by the japanese be-
cause there was an attempt at assassination as i left
the steamer

  respectfully submitted-bxv

  i looked up from the report and handed it back to
the secretary with a puzzled frown

  then i suppose you want me to analyze this sample
and duplicate the alloy if possible i asked

  i suppose you realize what a metal as light and
strong as this one means to aviation without waiting
for my answer he continued it means that japan
will be able to take the leadership in aviation not
only that but if she builds airplanes with body wings
and engine made out of this material she will be able
to launch a fleet against us that we will be unable to
defend ourselves against with naval carriers and
planes that can carry an enormous weight of fuel
japan can sweep far inland to our great cities and
wipe them off the map wkh the united states un-
prepared japan can establish a base in canada or in
one of the northwestern states before we can get
ready to defend ourselves their new planes will sweep
us off the face of the earth or at least bring us to
terms

  but our own planes i protested

  he waved his hand wearily

  planes built of this stuff can outmaneuver us their
planes will stand greater strain than ours our own
heavily built planes will be swept aside like tissue paper
what we must do is duplicate this alloy and build a de-
fensive fleet that or find a new means of defense
the first named is your job

  he waved a hand in dismissal and i left the building
with my precious sample outside tour guards fell
in behind me i realized that i had become an import-


amazing stories

ant personage since i had charge of the alloy inci-
dentally it might have been an accident but my car
was run into by a large car driven by a japanese chauf-
feur i luckily escaped injury and my guard follow-
ing in another car quickly rushed me to the laboratory

  perhaps you can imagine my surprise when i learned
that the new alloy was composed principally of lead
true there were a few other components but they
were of relatively little importance all my attempts
during the next week to duplicate the alloy failed i
concluded that it was a new crystalline allotropic form
of lead in some way the japanese had discovered
how to crystallize the lead in such a form as to give
it this extremely strong feature even though it were
very thin and light i concluded that the atomic struc-
ture must be very unusual to give it such properties

  my conclusions were verified when a small piece of
the alloy was put under a pressure of many thousands
atmospheres the result was a drop of ordinary lead
of many times less volume than the original piece this
proved my crystalline theory because pressure always
tends to put a substance in the denser form an ex-
ample of this is the fact that pressure lowers the
freezing point of water thus tending to keep the water
in the denser or liquid state

  in this dilemma my thoughts naturally turned to my
old friend harvey wilkins

  while i was puzzling over the matter an assistant
came in with a report that decided me he had been
working on the atomic weight of the lead and he re-
ported to me that it had an atomic weight of  that
night i took the night air-express to arizona

  i may explain here that  is the atomic weight of a
substance which is identical in every way with lead ex-
cept for the atomic weight and a very little difference
in the density ordinary lead is  while the two
other kinds of lead identical in every way except
for atomic weight and density have atomic weights of
 and  these are called isotopes and they result
from the disintegration of radium and thorium respec-
tively

  i confess that the thing was entirely beyond me i
couldnt figure out where they could have got such
enormous quantities of lead with an atomic weight of
 i knew that way back in  lead from all over
the world had been collected with results that all
checked at 

  it was midnight before we made out first stop and
i got hold of a newspaper i was shocked to see the
headlines shrieking that war clouds threaten
the account said that there had been some trifling mis-
understanding over some japanese in california and
that japan was demanding an explanation in very bel-
ligerent tones

  i also noted down in one corner that an enormous
fleet of japanese tramp steamers was now more than
half way across the pacific destination unknown but
believed to lie headed for south america

as we walked i took in the beautiful scene which
 lay before my eyes harvey had picked an ideal
location in the background lofty mountains reared
themselves against the rising sun the flying field was
long and narrow and had several hangars at one end
at the edge of the field as i have said stood the
laboratories and living quarters these i now had op-
portunity to observe more closely all the buildings

were built of grey concrete with very little attempt at
ornamentation none were over two stories in height
except one which had a small observatory tower on
one end of it it was to this structure that harvey led
me he took me to what i guessed to be his own private
den

  sit down and make yourself at home harvey said
then excitedly do you know i think ive got my
problem nearly solved

  i confess that i was a little brusque

  small good it will ever do you i said in a
couple of weeks well all be working for the japs-
those of us who arent dead

  harvey looked a little hurt but he politely asked me
to spill my tale of woe

  harvey sat silently thinking for a while and then
asked me questions about the alloy i showed him
my sample and he became quite excited over it firing
question after question at me

  what we want i said is something that can be
used for defense the alloy is of little use now why
japan may have declared war already

  give me the list of properties he said quietly
it may be of some use im not a magician you know

  i gave him the list of properties of the alloy and
watched him run down the list from specific gravity
melting point tensile strength and so on to the last
one that i had jotted down-the atomic weight of 

  i heard him gasp and he looked up suddenly

  is this atomic weight of  well established he
asked eagerly

  i nodded

  i think your problem is solved he said

  how-when-why  i gasped

  he held up his hand soothingly

  let us go out and see how bird is coming along

  i knew then that he would say no more in some
ways harvey wilkins was a very obstinate man

  as we walked out on the field we noticed that every-
body was excited they all seemed to be watching a
small black spot that hung motionless up in the sky

  it works dr wilkins it works a man exclaimed

  i knew it would harvey said

  it was not until a little later that i realized that i
was present at the first flight of bird howards
heliocopter of course there were many heliocoptera
before his time but they were only the forerunners
the machine that i saw that morning was the first of
the new type when he landed i took the opportu-
nity to examine it and its maker closely

  bird was just a slender fair-haired boy who was
only two years graduated from an aviation college he-
had won a special two-year scholarship and had come
here to continue his work on research in aviation

  his ship was not as stable nor as large as later ships
but it was a fairly good machine it had an octagonal
platform about twelve feet wide underneath this plat-
form there were eight rods which supported the ma-
chine as it landed each rod slid in its setting and
allowed the machine to settle down gently on four
wheels the rods could then be drawn up to allow the
machine to be wheeled close to the ground the plat-
form had a sort of observation cockpit with the controls
which was built in the middle of it at the front and
on each side were propellers to propel it forward
through the air

  at the back was a fourth propeller to pull the ma-
the great invasion of 



chine backwards in case the pilot happened to over-
shoot his mark a large fin sticking out at the back
below the fourth propeller was the only provision that
i could see for directing the machine although i later
learned that it could turn around much more quickly
than any ordinary airplane by the simple process of
cutting out one of the side propellers

  the most novel innovation however was the lifting
device extending above and to each side of the plat-
form were two rather small wings and above these
were at least a dozen propellers of various sizes and
shapes most of the motors controlling all these were
located in the steel framework above the platform and
even with the stubby wings i also learned that there
was a gyroscope in the center of the platform that acted
as a stabilizer

  -just a rickety old boat bird was saying ex-
ultantly as we came up shell probably shake her-
self to pieces pretty soon but shes proved practical and
thats all i care about she cant stay up over some five
hours at a time and she cant do more than about a
hundred and sixty kilometers an hour but you just
ought to see her go up and down i can drop her a
couple of hundred meters and jerk her out of it
though it almost takes the bottom out of her

  bird called dr wilkins come over here and let
me congratulate you

  bird came eagerly to get his word of praise

  i knew you could do it boy was all that he got
but it apparently was enough

  bird he said i want you to tighten up every bolt
on that thing and be ready to leave for seattle in three
hours or sooner ill put every mechanic on the place
on her

  all right doc was all bird said but his eyes were
shining

  harvey gave numerous orders and then designated
several men to come with him he turned to me just
before he left

  you better get a few hours sleep he advised if
i judge that contraption rightly we are going to need
nerves of steel

  with that he left me and i went slowly back to his
den and strangely enough i slept

  lets go was all harvey said six hours later

  i went out with him and together we got into a large
cabin monoplane which was warmed up and waiting
as soon as its pilot had it headed for seattle harvey lay
down and calmly went to sleep

  i hung over the radio eager to learn the latest de-
velopments in the controversy with japan as i tuned
in on one of the national news-broadcasting stations i
heard the announcer say matters are rapidly approach-
ing a crisis war with japan is inevitable their de-
mands lead to the belief that they wish to force war
upon the united states great britain as a whole
wishes to keep neutral but canada is bringing every
pressure to bear to throw her forces in with us seattle
tacoma and other coast cities are being evacuated
planes are being mobilized on felts field the great
airport at spokane no attack is expected immediately
but the fleet is coming north hawaii and the philip-
pines are making frantic preparations for war the
japanese fleet is reported to be sailing eastward the
most immediate fears result from a large fleet of jap-
anese ships supposedly merchant tramps which were

   about  miles

reported to be sailing for south america it now ap-
pears that they are further northward than that destina-
tion would indicate if they are hostile it will be known
within twenty-four hours for by tomorrow afternoon
they will be within striking distance

  that was the most important news that the radio
had to offer

  and that one man lying there peacefully asleep was
intending to check the supreme power of a great
nation

  we arrived at a small flying field near seattle some-
time during the night harvey and i were busy from
that time until morning arranging everything and get-
ting things ready for bird he and his companion
arrived with the dawn and they showed no bad effects
from their strenuous trip 

  well we got here he greeted us brightly had
to stop to get the tanks filled twice and once for engine
trouble but that was all right

  then it was that i got my first view of the weapon
that was to save the united states

  it wasnt very much to look at it was a tube about
three feet long with a large bulb on the lower end
the whole thing was mounted on a swivel base which
permitted it to be pointed in any direction appar-
ently it was made of fused sand-silica-and it was per-
fectly clear the lower part of the tube was sheathed
with what appeared to be layers of several metals the
outermost material being lead i could not see because
of the sheathing what was in the lower bulb two wires
connected the bulb with a generator this whole ap-
paratus was soon fastened securely on the platform of
the heliocopter

  now there is nothing to do but wait said harvey
we will be notified by radio of the approach of the
enemy

  i think the nervous strain told on all of us except
harvey while bird and his companion fussed with
bolts and engines while i paced up and down while
the pilot of the plane that brought us buck walters
hung over the radio harvey lay on his blanket chew-
ing on a straw and gazing up into the blue of the sky

  suddenly walters stood up

  the first fleet is coming he said quietly they
are still out about a hundred miles and our own air-fleet
will meet them near the shore of puget sound where
they can have the help of the shore batteries that
leaves us the space between good luck to you ill
do my part if they dont get me goodbye

  he silently walked over to his plane though he
never came back the name of buck walters will always
be remembered as the only american aviator to die in
the invasion of  his body was never recovered
but if you visit seattle you will find there a bronze
monument with the words on it he did his duty

  as walters plane left the field our own motors
roared and harvey and i fastened a sort of harness on
ourselves up up we went with hardly a jar

  how long it took i dont know but it seemed like
hours before we could distinguish that first grey line of
planes before we could see them we could see buck
coming back in his plane

  rapidly we dropped to a height a couple of hundred
meters above the enemy

  in the meantime buck was off to one side of us a
mile or so and almost as high as we were then it
was that i saw that his mission was to lay a wide smoke

screen in front of the oncoming fleet of planes

  suddenly the grim grey line appeared

  steadily without a tremor harvey aimed his tube
at one end of the grim grey line and swept the whole
length of it as though an invisible knife had shorn
through them the line melted away parts of some
planes disappeared some vanished completely but not
one escaped falling toward the sound was a silvery
sheet of liquid with the pilots kicking as they fell five
times harvey swept that line and five rows of ships
went down into the sound then walters who had
been circling above looped the loop and we knew that
our work was done for the moment

  twenty minutes later the second fleet followed the
first into oblivion

  it was during the annihilation of the third fleet that
we came near disaster two planes apparently decided
to rise to higher altitudes and they saw what happened
to their first line of ships

  without hesitation one of the ships dived at us it
was only birds sudden drop that saved us we had
already finished the second line of planes when we felt
the bottom drop out from under us when our drop
was checked the third line of ships was out of the cloud
and the ship that had tried to get us was swinging
around to try again although harvey was badly
shaken he managed to pick it off in mid-air and then to
get the rest of the ships before they could come within
firing-distance we had been rising and managed to dis-
pose of the fourth row of planes before it got very far

  suddenly we began to drop again and i looked up
to see the second of the two planes that had been above
us coming straight down at us in a power dive it
was at this moment that buck walters showed his
heroism how he got off to one side i never knew but
he came in like a flash of light to collide with the jap-
anese pilot a scant twenty meters above our heads the
two planes hurtled by us carrying two brave men to
their deaths

  that was the high point of the whole episode we
wiped out the remaining planes with little difficulty and
then went homewards to receive the plaudits of the
nation

  it was nearly a week before harvey and i could
escape from a too-grateful public then it was that i
sat down and said now out with it harvey how
does that tube of yours work

  well he said making himself comfortable it all
goes back to a day at college when you laughed at me
first though what is your idea of atomic weight

  why i replied slowly knowing that harvey would
tell things his own way an atom of oxygen is arbi-
trarily set at  and every other element is judged by it
for example an atom of helium is just one-fourth as
heavy as oxygen so it is called  every other one
of the ninety-two elements is compared to oxygen from
the lightest element hydrogen which is  up to
uranium the heaviest at a little more than 

  very good commented harvey with a smile
youve learned a little since we left college

  i	threw a cushion at him and he carefully tucked it
under him

  now i suppose you know that there is a theory that
all atomic weights except that of hydrogen are whole
numbers for example chlorine usually called thirty-
five and a half is really a mixture of atomic weights of

isotopes one of  and another of 

  now prout as far back as  thought that all
elements were built up from hydrogen atoms later as
it was found that helium and hydrogen nuclei were very
stable it was decided that all elements were made up
of combinations of nuclei of these two elements an
atom is made up of a positive nucleus and a number of
negative electrons revolving around it the electron
only weighs one eleven-hundred and fortieth of a single
positive nucleus or proton the loss of the extra weight
of the hydrogen atom above one is accounted for by the
theory that it is converted into energy since according
to the theory of relativity mass may be changed into
energy do you follow me

  im even ahead of you i grinned back at him
now to go back a bit what do you know about the
decomposition products of uranium

  not much i confessed go on

  well uranium decomposes rather slowly half of it
decomposes in five million years giving off a helium
nucleus half of the product uranium x decomposes
in about three weeks giving off one of the four extra
electrons left on it by the helium nucleus and this
product uranium x again gives off an electron half
of it decomposing in about one and a quarter minutes
this third new element uranium  has the same atomic
weight as uraniums xj and x and is therefore an iso-
tope of these then a helium nucleus comes off giving
ionium ionium gives off still another helium nucleus
and the product is radium is my monologue getting too
dry for you

  not too dry i answered but i think its getting
over my head

  he smiled and went on radium as i suppose you
know has a half-time decomposition of two thousand
years well it and its products by emission of alpha
particles charged helium nuclei and by beta particles
unit charges of negative electricity manage to result
finally in a product which cannot be distinguished from
ordinary lead except that its atomic weight is  in-
stead of  now i reasoned that the lead could be
moved over two places in the periodic table by the loss
of a helium nucleus it should be easier to break down
than ordinary lead which is a mixture of the two iso-
topes  and  a shift like that would result in

changing lead to-

  mercury i burst in eagerly

  exactly he smiled i built myself a cathode tube
using a uranium target a cathode of my own composi-
tion of radioactive material well it worked on radio-
active lead but on no other kind its effect was to cause
one helium nucleus to leave the lead i havent got the
process perfected yet

  the japanese evidently found some way to separate
lead into its two isotopes and then a way to crystallize
the lighter form into this strong and extremely light
form i think that the other things in your sample were
just impurities probably remaining from the separa-
tion

  he spread out his hands and shrugged his shoulders
thats about all you know the rest it was simple
from then on the silvery sheets that you saw falling
wese mercury and thats about all

  well i said fate certainly works things out just
the way she wants them doesnt she which under
the circumstances was about all that anyone could say

a tribute to amazing stories

editor amazing stories

   this is my first letter to you so i will start
in the conventional manner by congratulating
you on the standard of the mag especially
the discussions column the editorials and
the stories by dr e e smith i like his
stories best because they seem to me to con-
tain more authentic science in them than most
others here is my solitary complaint in your
may issue you published a story the doubt
though quite a good story there was not one
iota of scientifiction in it how would w
feel when on going into a shop for a pair of
gloves we were offered socks maybe good socks
but unsuitable for hands

   i was interested in r w haysens theory
of the conservation of heat energy by getting
in the shadow of an astral body this hap-
pens to be in my line of study so i will en-
deavor to explain as best as i can where he is
wrong his main fault lies in the concep-
tion of heat as being something material heat
particles or electrons as he calls the trans-
mission of heat being radiated or reflected
from the body

   it has been definitely established that heat
is another form of that omnipresent phe-
nomenon wave motion without which we
would lack heat light or sound the nature
of heat briefly is this heat or infra red rays
lie in that part of the spectrum between radio
and visible light rays these waves are the
result of the compression and rarefaction of
the ether at such a frequency that they ac-
celerate the movement of atoms thus causing
inoreased frictional energy or atomic vibrations
which reflect the waves or part of them the
rest being absorbed

   now let us see what would probably happen
to our hypothetical sky-pilot firstly he is
in the shadow of a planet so that he cannot
receive any benefit from the suns rays sec-
ondly the temperature of space is assumed
to be absolute zero - degrees centigrade i
think and thirdly the body has got to be kept
above a certain minimum temperature for its
proper functioning such as blood circulation
etc

   the only way our pilot could live would be
to bottle himself up with the vacuum flask
principle for nature abhors inequalities and
to think of this fellow trying to keep off freez-
ing by creating or preserving a body tempera-
ture of say  degrees f with surroundings
at about  degrees below is like thinking
of trying to drive the leviathan at full speed
with a domestic coal fire in fact his body
may dissolve for tis said that at absolute zero
all atomic movement ceases so that our en-
terprising friend would find his body resolving
into chemical formulae not that i am try-
ing to ridicule r w hs theory or himself
for it has often proved to be the tyro who
has shaken the authorities out of a recognized
rut of thought into the right direction any-
way it has provided me with some thoughtful
exercise to marshal concrete evidence of where
he goes off the trail and now haysen is
your chance to get back at me for the bee
has flown from my bonnet on that knotty prob-
lem gravity in itself a grave subject

  as most of us know there are two forces
acting on us from mother earth centrifugal
and centripetal force or gravity centrifugal
force is accounted for by the mechanical in-
ertia theory but not so gravity this mys-
terious force not only counteracts the enor-
mous centrifugal force that must exist but also
retains a tremendous surplus of energy sighs
from the worlds budget balancers

   there seems to me to be only one possible
solution to this and that is it is nothing more
nor less than an extreme form of wave mo-
tion for an analogy we can compare its fre-
quency with respect to the known waves to
ethers density with respect to ordinary mat-
ter i do not mean to infer that ether has
an infinite density for that would be a futile
argument to delineate it must be some form
of wave motion for all bodies no matter how
small have a certain amount of inherent at-
traction for other bodies as witness two small
pieces of cork in a bowl of water also other
planets and stars exert an attraction upon this
earth with ether as the only conducting medium
so far as is known ether can only transmit
energy by wave motion therefore there can
only be one answer to this problem i believe
magnetism also is kin to gravity but at a lower

frequency we can shield bodies from magnetic
attraction so why cannot we do the same as
regards gravity once we get a better idea of
its nature or when we find its frequency we
could possibly generate another frequency that
would break up the sequence comparatively
simple once we have an exact knowledge
of its nature

  people investigating in that line however
had better be very careful about discovering
it for if they happened on it whilst standing
on the piece under treatment they would need
an army of scrapers to remove the effects of
centrifugal force off the ceiling the pos-
sibility of conquering gravity certainly opens
up wonderful dreams i think the fellow that
did that would be able to live on his royalties
patents quite well if he survived the dis-
covery

  just one more piece before finishing ether
does not possess infinite density otherwise
the compression and rarefaction theory would
be washed out if anyone would care to cor-
respond on above and associated subjects i
will be only too pleased to do so

  we seldom pass a letter from a distant
country without expressing our gratification
of having readers so many degrees of longitude
away from us we carry out the idea ex-
pressed in your last sentence and we leave any
comments on your letter to correspondents
you certainly have given a great deal of
thought to the subject of heat waves we feel
however that speculating on what happens at
the absolute zero is decidedly unsafe as the
ether after all is still we think to be con-
sidered a hypothetical body if it is a body
at all the temperature of absolute zero is

some queries to be answered
about space radiated heat and

 air and the gaseous state
editor amazing stories

  i am writing this letter not to tell you
whether i like your magazine or not the fact
that i read it shows that i enjoy it but to
ask some questions which have been puzzling
me

  	the temperature of space is absolute zero
space is a perfect vacuum why and how can
anything freeze in space if there is nothing to
radiate heat to it would seem to me that
an animal body or any object generating heat
would freeze itself

  	it is a law of earth that nature abhors
a vacuum it seems to me that it is a law
of gravitation rather than a law of the uni-
verse

  may i illustrate

  in many stories about interplanetary disas-
ters the air rushes from the machine into the
vacuum of space but it is also stated that
every celestial body regardless of size has a
gravitational field depending on mass or weight
why is it that a man who quits the inter-
planetary vessel may be drawn to the vessel
by its gravity but the air and gas leave it
entirely

  	may i state my theory

  gas holds the same relation to space as oil
holds to water the gas does not mix with
space but emulsifies it will collect in globules
around any body which exerts a gravitational
field the ratio of density of the gas varies
directly with the ratio of gravitational attrac-
tion

  the heat of the sun on any celestial body
is generated by the bombardment of the mole-
cules of gas by the ions of radiant energy
therefore it is a physical impossibility for
gas to freeze

  the amount of heat generated varies directly
with the density of the gas and the distance
from the source of energy

  please set me right on these facts

a filament of a lamp radiates heat that it
troubles itself to know where the heat is going
is it not the sun that radiates an enormous

significant in size get an extremely small pro-
portion of the heat we certainly think that
any living body out in space would freeze to
death in short order the assertion that
nature abhors a vacuum is little more than
a proverbial way of expressing the fact that
air presses everywhere due to gravitation with
a pressure approximately  lbs to the square
inch it is perfectly just to say that the abovt
expression is  colloquial or picturesque way
of stating one of the phases of the action ef
gravitation the air in an interplanetary ve
sel is supposed to be at a pressure enormously
greater than the gravitation of the vessel would
imply if the vessel is open the air would
rush out as the gravitation of tbe vessel ti
far too slight to have any preceptible effect upoc
the elastic compressed air you say that it is
a physical impossibility for gas to freeze did
it ever occur to you that steam is a gas and
that by reduction of temperature it becomes
water and by further reduction freezes into
a solid the last clause of your question it
far from clear gas does not emulsify-

received it all right i take this opportunity

really one of my greatest pleasures in life and
i cannot at all imagine what i should do if
i were deprived of it for me it would be
a very great loss as i know you like to
hear about your readers preferences i men-

by the way ever since i read the latter i
have been making the most violent efforts to
get into the fourth dimension but as you

editor amazing stories

   in your last issue cities of ardathia and
the amirs magic could have been left out
for all the enjoyment i got out of them the
theme of the former is just about worn out-
the second story does not belong in your book
in the winter  quarterly i was very
much pleased with naval control starva-
tion in space and blue waters the last
was fine with excellent science

  i notioe that mr lemkin or should it be

as an author is increasing by leaps and bounds
what a pity the long story of the quarterly
voice across the years was so poor
some suggestions for improvement

  	a border one-half inch wide around the
cover

  	print the scientifiction emblem on the
cover

  	allot one-half page each month to an ex-
planation or a description of some new or up-
to-date scientific invention idea or achieve-
ment eg quantum theory cosmic rays
wave mechanics non-euclidean geometries
the evidence for element no  explana-
tion of the hypothetical coronium nebu-
lium asterium etc progress of rocket

  when you say that certain stories might
have been left out for all the enjoyment you
get out of them you must remember that it is
not only you that we are striving to please
there are many others to follow all your
suggestions the magazine would be materially
changed and this you must agree would be a
poor time to change since the magazine as it
is holds its own so well we have received so
many letters from readers who desire corre-
spondence with our authors that it seems very
probable that you will hear from some of
them-editor

  we feel that the discussions letters in
our magaazine are a most important part and
are very glad when they are long your criti-
cisms of the different stories are interesting and
require no comment as they express clearly
your idea the word omega literally means
the long o it is the last letter of the greek
alphabet and it is used figuratively to mean
the end of anything as the word alpha the
first letter of the greek alphabet is used to
indicate the first of anything thus the expres-
sion alpha and omega means the first
and last it so frequently happens in life that
something comes in handy that we fail to see
why it should not happen in a story-editor

editor amazing stories

  i have just finished the july issue of our
magazine including the discussions columns
which by the way was very long good

  i shall start at the cover which was fairly
good except for the resemblance of the martian
city to an american one

  thla of the drylands good but why
wasnt hypnotism used the first time barron
met the secret service operative

  north of matto grosso better but so
soon after the war it seemed peculiar that so
many clever inventions were available also
the ability of the disintegrating ray to de-
stroy only living matter was almost too good
to be true

  the metal doom better yet

  the lemurian documents good

  the resistant ray fair the story was
too convenient in places the rays did not
reach the ceiling although they had been ad-
justed for the width of the room the handi-
ness of the bar the remarkable power of the
ray much too convenient

  if you do not believe that the world is a
sphere how can you account for day and
night unless you believe that the sun goes
around it and if you try to carry out that old
time ptolemaic theory in the light of the dis-
coveries of modern astronomy you will find
yourself getting into endless trouble if the
world is not a sphere how can one travel all
around it without tumbling over the edge into
space the parallels of longitude really
not parallels at all represent the divisions of
time fifteen degrees corresponding to an hour
of time but these approach each other and
practically intersect at the north and south
poles if you could get close enough to the
poles you would find that an hour might be
represented by a variation in latitude of a
mile or less whereas at the equator something
like a thousand miles represents the variations
required for an hours variation of time if
you are in a boat on the sea or on the sea-
shore and a ship is approaching you will see
the top of the mast long before you see the
hull because as far as you are concerned the
ship is climbing a hill as it were to meet you
this you can see readily on any clear stretch
of water running east and west for a few
miles-editor

a letter about entropy with
allusions to a preceding letter
from p schuyler miller

editor amazing stories

  in the april  issue you published a
letter about entropy by p schuyler miller
mr miller states that the increase of entropy
is time i wish to elaborate this

  entropy is defined as the total quantity of
heat in the thermodynamic system divided by
the average temperature by this is meant -the
unavailable heat energy let us take a body
which has a temperature of  c and which
is constantly receiving heat by radiation the
absolute temperature of space is - c
the entire temperature between - and
 is unavailable for any use it is this heat
which is called entropy

  i assume that in any system whose tem-
perature increases at a regular rate the entropy
will also increase regularly this regular in-
crease of entropy is time now if the temper-
ature is increased suddenly or at variable
rates the entropy is also increased but at vari-
able rates and the flow of time is not regular
therefore it may be possible to bridge a large
amount of time in a short while if a way is
found to increase the entropy of the system

  in the same issue mrs tuckerman writes
that an absolute zero is impossible in inter-
stellar space this is false and i wili attempt
to show why heat is the kinetic energy of
moving molecules in interstellar space mat-
ter is very rare so rare that nearly a perfect
vacuum exists since heat is produced by
molecular motion the greater amount of mole-
cules in motion the greater the heat content
the few molecules present in the average cubic

the meaning of it was changed some years ago

description of the drums droning through the

quite impressive if you will lode over our

an answer to mr julian grays
recent criticism in our discus-
sions columns

editor amazing stories

  i should like to point out a few considera-
tions which apparently have been overlooked
by mr julian gray in his thoughtful and well-
written criticism of science fiction in the letter
columns of the june amazing stories

  to begin with it seems to me that his defi-
nition of literature as being exclusively a study
of human reactions and character-development
is rather narrow and limited literature can
be and does many things and one of its most
glorious prerogatives is the exercise of imagina-
tion on things that lie beyond human experience
-the adventuring of fantasy into the awful
sublime and infinite cosmos outside the human
aquarium in this genre of which science
fiction is one branch the main interest lies in
other elements than mere character-reaction and
development such as would properly be empha-
sized in a tale of ordinary events and condi-
tions

  of course science-fiction can has been and
will be written with a dose attention to veri-
similitude in such matters but for the initiate
in this type of fiction and highly imaginative
and fantastic fiction in general the real thrill
comes from the description of ultrahuman
events forces and scenes which properly dwarf
the terrene actors to comparative insignificance
for many people-probably more than mr
gray realizes-imaginative stories offer a wel-
come and salutary release from the somewhat
oppressive tyranny of the homocentric and help
to correct the deeply introverted ingrowing
values that are fostered by present-day human-
ism and realistic literature with its unhealthy
materialism and earth-bound trend science
fiction at its best is akin to sublime and
exalted poetry in its evocation of tremendous
non-anthropomorphic imageries to demand in
such tales the intensive earthly observation of
a hardy is idle and beside the point and one
who approaches them from this angle will miss
the true value and beauty

  it seems to me too that mr gray makes a
pretty sweeping statement in his remarks about
science fiction authors doubtless there are
hacks in this branch of writing as in all others
but on the other hand there are sincere
imaginative artists one has only to name
a merritt at least in his earlier work such
as the original novelette version of the moon
pool stanton coblentz who has written
some gorgeous fantastic satires john taine a
master of authentic science and h p love-
c-aft whose the color out of space goes
infinitely beyond anything of h g wells in
its sheer imaginative scope and creation of
atmosphere to say that science fiction writers
are men of doubtful education and still more
doubtful intelligence because they prefer

imaginative happenings cosmic forces atmos-
phere etc to psychological analysis is an ut-
terly pointless and senseless statement but
since there is a fixed gulf wider and deeper
than erebus between imaginative people and
those who lack imagination it is no doubt
equally senseless to argue this question

  certainly however one must admit that
there is vast room for improvement in the
general body of science-fiction this im-
provement it seems to me could lie in the
direction of more skilful and finished writing
the exclusion of the trite and overworked and
the elimination of many stories which on close
analysis are revealed as mere gangster tales or
ordinary adventure stories with a futuristic or
ultra-planetary setting a few editorial mea-
sures of this sort would go far to remove the
reproach which can justly be brought against
science-fiction magazines as a well-wisher a
reader-and also a writer of this genre-i sin-
cerely hope that such an improvement will in
time be brought about

  there is one other matter that i should like
to touch upon mr grays preliminary re-
marks about the general development of lit-
erature to judge from these one would think
that the worlds literature is marked off in
perfectly distinct geological strata i and that
all the former more primitive layers are now
hermetically sealed beneath a deep and solid
stratum of realism this however is not the
case romanticism both in novels and short
magazine stories is still the most popular and
widely read genre and as for the supernatural
which mr gray puts at the archean bottom-
well even that despised branch of literary en-
deavor is having its innings both with writers
and readers apart from folk-lore the lit-
erature of the supernatural is almost a modern
invention anyway and some of the best work
in that genre is being done at the present time
realism even though it is the only form
favored by the alleged quality magazines and
the self-appointed critical pontiffs certainly
doesnt have the field all to itself and i think
one can safely predict that it never will the
intolerable conditions of modern life and mech-
anistic civilization will one thinks be more
and more conducive to the development of a
literature of imaginative escape

  there is still another angle which occurs to
me apropos of mr grays letter after all
why shouldnt literature or at least one literary
genre emphasize what he calls the inhuman
which more properly is tfre non-human or
extra-human isnt it only the damnable pre-
posterous and pernicious egomania of the race
which refuses to admit anything but mans own
feelings desires aims and actions as worthy of
consideration 

  this egomania alas is manifested in other
ways than through literature and lies at the
bottom of that ruthless aggrandization that
maltreatment of weaker life-forms that pre-
sumptuous meddling with the delicate balance
of planetary forces which may sweep our
present-day civilization into the limbo of the
dinosaurs i fear that many super-scientific
tales which depict a world-wide catastrophe
as the result of human meddling with nature
may prove to be all too prophetic any type of
writing that would serve even in the smallest
degree as a brake on the madly careening
wheels of this racial egomania is it seems to
me more than praiseworthy from a moral
standpoint if from none other

                 clark ashton smith
                         auburn calif

  ps on re-reading mr grays letter i find
that i have forgotten to mention the matter of
h g wells which he brings up doubtless it
is the particular trend of wells mental develop-
ment that has led him in latter years to
abandon the writing of science fiction for that
of sociological novels wells when he wrote
the marvelous time machine the war
of the worlds and other fine fantasies had
in him much of the artist perhaps even a
little of the poet these however have been
progressively smothered and drowned out by
the growth of the pedagogue the utilitarian
humanist

  as to aldous huxley i have not read his
brave new world which i should judge
from reviews is marked by the same congenital
pornography as huxleys ordinary novels
satire of course is a well-recognized function
of much science fiction and perhaps some of
it has been a little too subtle for mr grays
apprehension he seems to have missed stan-
ton coblentz of whom i have already spoken

if i cared to i could name others in whom
the satire is even more subtle and implicit

  if mr gray should find my language some-
what violently polemical in places he must
realize that i have merely availed myself of
that parliamentary privilege which he in his
own letter has already avowedly pre-empted

  in conclusion lot me recommend to mr
gray and to others who are similarly minded
the perusal of imaginative fiction for what it
really is rather than for what it isnt also
he should realize that there are intelligent and
not necessarily immature people who have the
courage to dissent from the limited and grossly
materialistic definition of literature which he
has laid down and who moreover are not over-
awed by the burden of present-day authority

  the subject of science-fiction is more or
less abstract and cannot be treated like a prob-
lem of mathematics but in science-fiction the
description of personality of the characters is
all important nothing can make a story so
vivid of whatever type it may be as a true
picture of human nature however we may
complain about its imperfections we have to
consider human nature extremely interesting
we have a very good gauge in our work for
our stories from the standpoint of this science-
fiction we publish as you have noticed a
questionnaire answers to the questions con-
tained are to be found in the stories and page
numbers are always given sometimes we fear
that we shall not get enough questions and
should like to have from twelve to twenty of
them but somehow there always are a reason-
able number we certainly agree with you in
your criticism of the special type of modern
fictional literature science-fiction does its part
to lift up stories and romances out of the rut
of realism which as you practically say are
to be judged by ingrowing values you will be
surprised if you knew how many books of
science-fiction have come out year by year
one would suppose that no one would take it
up except such writers as h g wells and wc
know that there is no living jules verne and
even mr wells is flying off more or less on a
tangent in what he considers important subjects
then we had the sherlock holmes stories
which of course have a touch of science in
them but the author conan doyle was car-
ried away by psychic research as the subject
of his more recent years work has been called
it does us good to read over your notes on
authors and comments we have always felt
that our american writers if anything sur-
passed the english authors decidedly in this
line of fiction literature of the super-natural
goes back a good many years and it is called
folk-lore we were certainly amused at your
comments on mr wells recent courses in
writing we certainly agree with you-

a long letter about dr smith

editor amazing stories

  poor old doc again be has been un-
horsed and his faithful charger has fled only
he remains upon the field alone and almost
borne down by the sheer weight of his armor
his foe like the bold de la mark is riding
mercilessly over and around him waiting for
an opportune moment to deal the last crushing
blow earlier in the day doc met another
very formidable foe and that encounter has
apparently weakened him that enemy how-
ever is lying deliriously off to one side nurs-
ing a broken skull and waving his weapon
around in a mad frenzy suddenly a black
knight appears upon the field his black
charger gallops at full speed toward the nearly
doomed comrade- instantly the almost vic-
torious knight counters and rushes upon the
new enemy what will be the result but
that matters little if doc has a chance to
get up and find his horse the black knights
efforts will be fully rewarded

  now mr dunark you admit that seaton
saved your life several times you also admit
that he presented you and yonr race with many
almost unrepayable gifts now these things
being true it is only natural that you should
regard this man not as one of the common
herd but as one to whom honor is due even
if you were able to confer with seaton in his
own customary mode of speech you would be
a little loath to use the lower form of english
in his presence and only at times when you
were utterly unable because of your very

nature to understand how seaton could be so
soft and sentimental would you tell him in
his own words what you thought of him

  this other little point although almost im-
material might help matters slightly you
admit mr dunark that you were able to
speak precisely as seaton did at one time
in your adventures you actually spoke as
seaton would have spoken under similar cir-
cumstances therefore you did speak pre-
cisely as seaton did but you never allowed
this manner of address to become a habit
thank you mr dunark i am sure that your
evidence completely absolves your creator of
any erroneous complications in your anatomy
personally i wouldnt have said goodbye either

  hoping that old doc has found his gal-
lant steed the black knight will now proceed
to the sidelines in order to add further to the
misery of the defeated champion of the first
fray

  as to the matter of slang much can be
argued pro and con i must say however that
dr smiths characters are more true to life
than mr campbells whether or not this is
due to slang i cannot say because i am sure
that dr smith could develop his characters
without the use of any slang whatsoever his
descriptions are far superior to mr camp-
bells and i believe that i am right when i
say the same thing about his characters mr
campbell however has a better scientific base
for his stories at least it is better in the
eyes of modern science but i believe that
dr smith has taken it into consideration that
over a period of years scientific views change
considerably because he uses very few of the
modern scientific concepts in his stories

  since an argument about scientific fiction
must necessarily employ quite a bit of beating
around the bush i think that it would be a
good idea to use a few known facts-not
figures i believe that i too could set up a
very great probability against the molecular
motion drive but why argue about how many
angels can stand on the head of a pin the
main thing is that two of the assumptions on
which dr smiths story is based are now actual
scientific facts in the cavendish laboratory
at cambridge university dr coekcroft and
e t s walton have shattered the atom with
only  volts and they obtained energy
equivalent to  volts whether or not
there was a corresponding decrease in amperage
i do not know because the details of the ex-
periment are secret nevertheless the fact re-
mains that atomic disintegration of the lighter
elements is an actual fact it is also reported
from ft worth texas that an inventor has
succeeded in imprinting upon fine steel wires
both sound and televisional impulses a me-
chanical educator is not so highly improbable
either

  well sir campbell have any of your basic
assumptions come to pass what well then
i am sure that miss robbs laurels belong
upon the lofty brow of dr smith

                             whitis
                            austin texas

  this writer from the lone star state most
amusingly depicts the correspondence which
dr smiths excellent story has brought about
if the story had not been so good it would not
have excited the comment which it has and this
comment whatever its bearing we regard as
a great compliment to the story indicating that
it makes an impression which is of course what
every author wants his work to do we do
not think that dr smith was ever unhorsed
he certainly has been well able to take care
of himself and it is rather amusing that the
unfavorable comments on the slang which
dr smith used very properly in his story
started in england and english slang we con-
sider far less picturesque and interesting than
american the ending of a remark with the
interrogative pronoun what which is a
typical english habit always seems quite dis-
agreeable you will find this in many english
novels as regards your angels standing on
the head of a pin if our memory serves us
right there was a question as to how many
could support themselves on the point of this
adjunct of the female toilet as of a needle
volts which you treat as energy are really
units of potential the impressing of the voice
on a steel wire is an old story which was done
by poulson who is called the swedish edison
and it is only going a step farther to put tele-
vision on a wire-editor

the best authors in amazing
stories according to the judg-
ment of a reader of many years
standing
editor amazing stories

  i have read practically every issue of amaz-
ing stories except the first campbell and
smith are undoubtedly your best authors dr
keller and some others run close to them

  in your reply to mr j w bucks letter in
the april  issue you said we are still
hoping to see the skylark of space in book
form well why not print it yourself i
can guarantee you three sales in pasadena
now the population of this town is about
 suppose you sold only three copies in
pasadena and only three copies to every 
people in the united states if that were true
you would sell more than  copies on the
basis of  total population of the
united states i think i have been ridiculously
conservative think it over and in the mean-
time get dr smith to write another skylark
story with the same characters as the other two
even a sequel to spacehounds of ipc will be
very acceptable

                            castle green
                            pasadena calif

  we wish that dr smith had more time at
his disposal so as to give us more stories the
teck publications inc has not yet gone into
book publishing but it is not at all impossible
that it may in the future the calculation of
the sale of books would be very tempting but
for one thing as a boy said about some ani-
mal there aint no such animal as three
books sold for every  inhabitants there
is nothing ridiculous in predicting a four or
five thousand copies sale of a book many have
been published with the greatest expectations
from authors and publishers but have fallen
flat the public is a testy uncertain proposi-
tion we want to establish more definitely the
sale demand for the skylark stories in book
form before we publish it but we are more
hopeful of getting this started than ever any-
how we would want a fair guaranteed amount
first-editor

a letter from a reader who has
perused our magazine for over
four years and during that
time has only managed to reach
the age of sixteen
editor amazing stories

  although only sixteen i have been a con-
stant reader of amazing stories for over four
years through all this time i have never
screwed up my courage far enough to ask you
why you did not run a sequel to in mine and
my friends estimation one of the best stories
you have ever printed the metal horde by
john campbell jr this story appeared about
two years ago in one of your issues i believe
the metal horde is the name

  it dealt with the subject of brain machines
and interplanetary travel and was a sequel to
when the atoms failed the story ended
very unsatisfactorily leaving earth and mars
trying to communicate with the star sirius let
the sequel tell of the success of the attempt
and the results of it by the way whatever
became of campbell he was good

  for the rest of the magazine i can say it is
okay and far above the other magazines of its
type on the market there is one fault how-
ever that should be remedied i agree with
the criticism of the argentinian as the illus-
trations with the exception of a few cases do
not follow the description given by the author

                        vincent doyle

                       lynde st

                             oakland calif

  as far as sequels are concerned they rest
with the authors we are sure that our favor-
ite authors favorite in the sense that they are
favorites of our readers would give sequels if
they saw their way clear to do so but you
must remember that a sequel must have some
relation to the story and that a story which at
its end seems to beg for a sequel is defective
in that respect we have to thank you for
what you have to say in your last paragraph
the illustrations as a general rule do follow
the description given by the author as in
terpreted by the artist interpretations also
vary the caption for each illustration you
will observe is taken from the text of the
story-editor
