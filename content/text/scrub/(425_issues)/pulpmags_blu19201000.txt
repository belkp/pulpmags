 when the faces of men
       are turned toward home

                 worry and defeat are written on
                 some but on others you read mastery

in the morning the faces of men
have little to tell sleep has
erased the lines

  but in the evening when the
day has written its record you
can almost read the message of
their minds

 we must tackle our budget
again tonight one tired face says
 somehow we must discover ways
to trim it even more

 i wish i knew whether the
raise ive asked for is going thru
another reads  its little enough
but we need it

  and here and there among the
crowd self-confident faces shine
out-the faces of men who have
conquered worry and fear because
training has made them masters
not servants of their work

the high cost of living does not
worry these men

the chief satisfaction of the
alexander hamilton institute
is in the fact that it has increased
and is every day increasing the
number of men whose minds are
free to think about the big things
in business because the little
problems of income and expense
have been eliminated by added
earning power

    when so many men are harassed
 by the cost of living these mens
 minds are free their cost of living
 has increased  but their earning
 power has increased even faster

    before you spend another min-
 ute in thinking of the cost of living
 invest a moment in sending for the
 book which describes the modern
 business course and service

    see if for you-as for thousands

crooked as a dogs hind laig

it was a land of splintered peaks of
deep gorges of barren mesas burned
by the suns of a million torrid sum-
mers the normal outgrowth of it was
warfare life here had to protect itself
with a tough and callous rind to attack
with a swift and deadly sting only the
fit survived

  but moonlight had magically touched
the hot wrinkled earth with a fairy god-
mothers wand it was bathed in a weird
mysterious beauty into the crotches of
the hills lakes of wondrous color had been
poured at sunset the crests had flamed
with crowns of glory the canons became
deep pools of blue and purple shadow
blurred by kindly darkness the gaunt
ridges had softened to pastels of violet and
the bony mountains to splendid sentinels
keeping watch over a gulf of starlit space

  around the campfire the drivers of the
trail-herd squatted on their heels or lay
sprawled at ease the glow of the leaping
flames from the twisted mesquite lighted
their lean faces tanned to bronzed health

eoiue

 by the beat of an untempered sun and the
 sweep of parched winds most of them
 were still young scarcely out of their boy-
 hood a few had reached maturity but
 all were products of the desert its alkali
 dust was caked on their unshaven cheeks
 the high-heeled boots the leather chaps
 were worn at its insistence upon every
 line of their features every shade of their
 thought it had stamped its brand indel-
 ibly

   the talk was frank and elemental it
 had the crisp crackle that goes with free
 unfettered youth in a parlor some of it
 would have been offensive but under the
 stars of the open desert it was as natural
 as the life itself they spoke of the spring
 rains of the crawford-steelman feud of
 how they meant to turn malapi upside
 down in their frolic when they reached
 town they rode each other gayly with
 jokes that were familiar old friends their
 horseplay was rough but good-natured

   out of the soft shadows of the summer
 night a boy moved from the remuda to-
 ward the campfire he was a lean sandy
 haired young fellow his figure still lank
 and unfilled in another year his shoul-

 all rights reserved
gun-sight pass



ders would be broader his frame would
take on twenty pounds as he sat down
on the wagon-tongue at the edge of the
firelit circle the stringiness of his appear-
ance became more noticeable

a young man waved a hand toward
 him by way of introduction gents
of the d bar lazy r outfit we now have
with us roostin on the wagon-tongue mr
david sanders formerly of arizona just
returned from makin love to his paint hoss
mr sanders will make oration on the why
wherefore and how-come-it of chiquitos
superiority to all other equines whatever
the youth on the wagon-tongue smiled
his blue eyes were gentle and friendly
from his pocket he had taken a knife and
was sharpening it on one of his down-at-
the-heel boots

  id like right well to make love to that
pinto my own sef bob commented a
weatherbeaten puncher any old time
dave wants to saw him off onto me at
sixty dollars im here to do business
youre sure an easy mark buck
grunted a large fat man leaning against a
wheel his white expressionless face and
soft hands differentiated him from the
tough range-riders he did not belong
with the outfit but had joined it the day
before with george doble a half brother
of the trail foreman to travel with it as
far as malapi in the southwest he was
known as ad miller the two men had
brought with them in addition to their own
mounts a led packhorse

  doble backed up his partner sure are
buck i can get cow-ponies for ten and
fifteen dollars-all i want of em he said
and contrived by the lift of his lip to make
the remark offensive

  not ponies like chiquito ventured
sanders amiably

  that so jeered doble

  he looked at david out of a sly and
shifty eye he had only one the other
had been gouged out years ago in a drunken
fracas

  you couldnt get chiquito for a hun-
dred dollars not for sale the owner of
the horse said a little stiffly

  millers fat paunch shook with laughter

i reckon not-at that price id give all
of foty for him

  different here replied doble what
has this pinto got that makes him worth
over thirty

  hes some bronc explained bob

the blue

hart got a lag full of tricks a nice
disposition and sure can burn the wind
yore friend must be valuing them par-
lor tricks at ten dollars apiece murmured
miller hed ought to put him in a show
and not keep him to chase cow-tails with
at that ive seen circus hosses that
werent one-two-three with chiquito hell
shake hands and play dead and dance to a
mouth-organ and come a-runnin when
dave whistles

  you dont say the voice of the fat
man was heavy with sarcasm and on
top of all that edjucation he can run
too

the temper of sanders began to take an
edge he saw no reason why these
strangers should run on him to use the
phrase of the country i dont claim my
pintos a racer but he can travel
hmp grunted miller skeptically

  im here to say he can boasted the
owner stung by the manner of the other

  dont look to me like no racer doble
dissented why id be most willing to
bet that packhorse of ours whisky bill
can beat him

  buck byington snorted packhorse
eh

  the old punchers brain was alive with
suspicions on account of the lameness of
his horse he had returned to cany in the
middle of the day and had discovered the
two newcomers trying out the speed of the
pinto he wondered now if this precious
pair of crooks had been getting a line on
the pony for future use it occurred to
him that dave was being engineered into
a bet

  the chill hard eyes of miller met his
thats what he said buck-our pack-
horse

  for just an instant the old range-rider
hesitated then shrugged his shoulders it
was none of his business he was a cau-
tious man not looking for trouble more-
over the law of the range is that every
man must play his own hand wherefore
he dropped the matter with a grunt that
expressed complete understanding and de-
rision

  bob hart helped things along jokin
aside whats the matter with a race well
be on the salt flats tomorrow ive got
ten bucks says the pinto can beat yore
whisky bill

  go you once answered doble after a
moments apparent consideration being
book magazine

as im drug into this ill be a dead game
sport i got fifty dollars more to back the
packhorse how about it sanders you
got the sand to cover that or are you
plumb scared of my broomtail

  betcha a months pay-thirty-five dol-
lars give you an order on the boss if i
lose retorted dave he had not meant
to bet but he could not stand this fellows
insolent manner

  that order good dug asked doble
of his half-brother

  the foreman nodded he was a large
leather-faced man in the late thirties his
reputation in the cattle country was that
of a man ill to cross dug doble was a
good cowman-none better outside of
that his known virtues were negligible ex-
cept for the primal one of gameness

  might as well lose a few bucks myself
seeing as whisky bill belongs to me said
miller with his wheezy laugh who wants
to take a whirl boys

  inside of three minutes he had placed a
hundred dollars the terms of the race
were arranged and the money put in the
hands of the foreman

  each man to ride his own caballo
suggested hart slyly

  this brought a laugh the idea of ad
millers two hundred fifty pounds in the
seat of a jockey made for hilarity

  i reckon george will have to ride the
broomtail we dont aim to break its
back replied miller genially

  his partner was a short man with a
spare wiry body few men trusted him
after a glance at the mutilated face the
thin hard lips gave warning that he had
sold himself to evil the low forehead
above which the hair was plastered flat in
an arc advertised low mentality

an hour later buck byington drew san-
    ders to one side

  dave youre a chuckle-headed rabbit
if ever i seen tinhorn sports them two is
such theyre collecting a living offn
suckers didnt you sabe that come-on
stuff their packhorse is a ringer they
tried him out this evening but i noticed
they ran under a blanket both of em
are crooked as a dogs hind laig

  maybe so admitted the young man
but chiquito never went back on me yet
these fellows may be overplaying their
hand dont you reckon

  not a chancet that tumblebug miller
is one fishy proposition and his side-kick

by william macleod raine



doble-say hes the kind of a bird that
shoots you in the stomach while hes shak-
ing hands with you theyre about as
warm-hearted as a loan shark when hes
turnin on the screws-and about as im-
pulsive me i aim to button up my
pocket when those guys are around

  dave returned to the fire the two
visitors were sitting side by side and the
leaping flames set fantastic shadows of
them moving one of these rooted where
miller sat was like a bloated spider watch-
ing its victim the other dwarfed and
prehensile might in its uncanny silhouette
have been an imp of darkness from the
nether regions

  most of the riders had already rolled up
in their blankets and fallen asleep to a
reduced circle miller was telling the story
of how his packhorse won its name

  so i noticed he was acting kinda funny
and i seen four pin-pricks in his nose o
course i hunted for mr rattler and killed
him then i give bill a pint of whisky
it cetainly paralyzed him proper he got
salivated as a mule-whacker on a spree
his nose swelled up till it was big as a
barrel-never did get down to normal
again since which the ol plug has been
whisky bill

  this reminiscence did not greatly en-
tertain dave he found his blankets
rolled up in them and promptly fell asleep
for once he dreamed and his dreams were
not pleasant he thought that he was
caught in a net woven by a horribly fat
spider which watched him try in vain to
break the web that tightened on his arms
and legs desperately he struggled to es-
cape while the monster grinned at him
maliciously and the harder he fought the
more securely was he enmeshed

chapter ii
the race

the coyotes were barking when the
cooks triangle brought dave from
his blankets the objects about him
were still mysterious in the pre-dawn
darkness the shouting of the wranglers
and the bells of the remuda came music-
ally as from a great distance

  hart joined his friend and the two
young men walked out to the remuda to-
gether each rider had on the previous
night belled the mount he wanted for he
knew that in the morning it would be too
gun-sight pass

dark to distinguish one broncho from an-
other the animals were rim-milling go-
ing round and round in a circle to escape
the lariat

  dave rode in close and waited rope
ready his ears attuned to the sound of his
own bell a horse rushed jingling past
the rope snaked out fell true tightened
over the neck of the cowpony brought up
the animal short instantly it surrendered
making no further attempt to escape the
roper made a hitch round the nose of the
broncho swung to its back and cantered
back to camp

  in the gray dawn near details were be-
coming visible the mountains began to
hover on the edge of the young world the
wind was blowing across half a continent

  sanders saddled then rode out upon the
mesa he whistled sharply there came
an answering nicker and presently out
of the darkness a pony trotted the pinto
was a sleek and glossy little fellow beauti-
ful in action and gentle as a kitten

  the young fellow took the well-shaped
head in his arms fondled the soft dainty
nose that nuzzled in his pocket for sugar
fed chiquito a half handful of the delicacy
in his open palm and put the pony through
the repertory of tricks he had taught his
pet

  you wantta shake a leg today old fel-
low and throw dust in that tinhorns face
he murmured to his four-footed friend
gentling it with little pats of love and ad-
miration adios chiquito i know you
wont throw off yore old pal so long old
pie-eater

  across the mesa dave galloped back
swung from the saddle and made a bee-
line for breakfast the other men were
already busy at this important business
from the tail of the chuck-wagon he took
a tin cup and a tin plate he helped him-
self to coffee soda biscuits and a strip of
steak just forked from a large kettle of
boiling lard presently more coffee more
biscuits and more steak went the way of
the first helping the hard-riding life of
the desert stimulates a healthy appetite

the punchers of the d bar lazy r
 were moving a large herd to a new
range it was made up of several lots
bought from smaller outfits that had gone
out of business under the pressure of fall-
ing prices short grass and the activity of
rustlers the cattle had been loose-bedded
in a gulch close at hand the upper end of

the blue

which was sealed by an impassable cliff
many such canons in the wilder part of
the mountains fenced across the face to
serve as corrals were used by rustlers as
caches into which to drift their stolen
stock this one no doubt had more than
once played such a part in days past

  expertly the riders threw the cattle back
to the mesa and moved them forward
among the bunch one could find the t
anchor brand the circle cross the dia-
mond tail and the x-z scattered among
the cows burned with the d bar lazy r
which was the original brand of the owner
emerson crawford

  the sun rose and filled the sky in a
heavy cloud of dust the cattle trailed
steadily toward the distant hills

  near noon buck byington passing dave
where he rode as drag-driver in the wake
of the herd shouted a greeting

turble hot im spittin cotton
dave nodded his eyes were red and
sore from the alkali dust his throat dry as
a lime-kiln you done said it buck
hotter n hell or yuma

  dug says for us to throw off at seven
mile hole

  i wont make no holler at that

  the herd leaders reading the signs of a
spring close at hand quickened the pace
with necks outstretched bawling loudly
they hurried forward forty-eight hours
ago they had last satisfied their thirst
usually doble watered each noon but the
desert yesterday had been dry as sahara
only such moisture was available as could
be found in black grama and needle grass

  the point of the herd swung in toward
the cottonwoods that straggled down from
the draw for hours the riders were kept
busy moving forward the cattle that had
been watered and holding back the pressure
of thirsty animals

  again the outfit took the desert trail
heat-waves played on the sand the sun
rays were like tongues of fire vegetation
grew scant except for patches of cholla and
mesquite a sand-cherry bush here and
there occasionally a clump of shining poi-
son ivy a heavy cloud of yellow dust
rolled forward with the herd

  sunset brought them to the salt flats
the foreman gave orders to throw off and
make camp

a course was chosen for the race
 from a selected point the horses were
to run to a clump of mesquite round it
book magazine

and return to the starting place dug
doble was chosen both starter and judge

  dave watched whisky bill with the
trained eyes of a horseman the animal
was an ugly brute as to the head its eyes
were set too close and the shape of the
nose was deformed from the effects of the
rattlesnakes sting but in legs and body
it had the fine lines of a racer the horse
was built for speed the cowpunchers
heart sank his bronco was fast willing
and very intelligent but the little range-
pony had not been designed to show its
heels to a near-thoroughbred

  are you ready doble asked of the
two men in the saddles

  his brother said let er gol san-
ders nodded the revolver barked

  chiquito was off like a flash of light
found its stride instantly the training of
a cowpony makes for alertness for im-
mediate response before it had covered
seventy-five yards the pinto was three
lengths to the good dave flying toward
the halfway post heard his friend harts
triumphant yip yip yippy-yip coming
to him on the wind

  he leaned forward patting his horse on
the shoulder murmuring words of encour-
agement into its ear but he knew with-
out turning round that the racer galloping
at his heels was drawing closer its long
shadow thrown in front of it by the wes-
tering sun reached to daves stirrups
crept to chiquitos head moved farther
toward the other shadow plunging wildly
eastward foot by foot the distance be-
tween the horses lessened to two lengths
to one to half a length the ugly head of
the racer came abreast of the cowpuncher
with sickening certainty the range-rider
knew that his chiquito was doing the best
that was in it whisky bill was a faster
horse

  simultaneously he became aware of two
things the bay was no longer gaining
the halfway mark was just ahead the
cowpuncher knew exactly how to make the
turn with the least possible loss of speed
and ground too often in headlong pur-
suit of a wild hill steer he had whirled as
on a dollar to leave him any doubt now
scarce slackening speed he swept the pinto
round the clump of mesquite and was off
for home

  dave was halfway back before he was
sure that the thud of whisky bills hoofs
was almost at his heels he called on the
cowpony for a last spurt the plucky

little horse answered the call gathered it-
self for the home stretch for a moment
held its advantage again bob harts yell
drifted to sanders

  then he knew that the bay was running
side by side with chiquito was slowly
creeping to the front the two horses
raced down the stretch together whisky
bill half a length in the lead and gaining
at every stride daylight showed between
them when they crossed the line

  chiquito had been outrun by a speedier
horse

chapter iii
dave rides on his spurs

hart came up to his friend grinning
well you old horn-toad we got no
kick cornin chiquito ran a mighty
pretty race only trouble was his laigs
wasnt long enough

  the owner of the pony nodded a lump
in his throat he was not thinking about
his thirty-five dollars but about the futile
race into which he had allowed his little
beauty to be trapped dave would not be
twenty-one till coming grass and it hurt
his boyish pride to think that his favorite
had been beaten he stroked in silence
the heaving flank of the pinto

  another lank range-rider drifted up
same here dave ill kiss my twenty
bucks good-by cheerful youn the lil
hoss ran the best race at that chiquito
started like a bullet out of a gun and say
boys how he did swing round on the
turn

  much obliged steve i reckon he
sure done his best said sanders grate-
fully

  the voice of george doble cut in openly
and offensively jubilant me id ruther
show the way at the finish than at the
start youre more liable to collect the
mazuma ill tell you now that broom-
tail never had a chance to beat whisky
bill

  yore hoss can run seh admitted
dave

  i know it but you dont he didnt
have to take the kinks out of his legs to
beat that plug

  you get our money said hart quietly
aint that enough without rubbin it in

  sure i get yore money-easy money at
that boasted doble got any more you
want to put up on the circus bronc

  steve russell voiced his sentiments
gun-sight pass

                                       

curtly you make me good and tired
doble theres only one thing i hate more
n a poor loser-and thats a poor winner
as for putting my money on the pinto ill
just say this ill bet my lil pile he can
beat yore bay twenty miles a hundred
miles or five hundred

  not any thanks whisky bill is a
racer not a mule-team miller said laugh-
ing

  the young cowpuncher loosened the
center-fire cinch of his ponys saddle he
noted that there was no real geniality in
the fat mans mirth it was a surface thing
designed to convey an effect of good fellow-
ship back of it lay the chill implacability
of the professional gambler

the usual give-and-take of gay repartee
was missing at supper that night since
they were of the happy-go-lucky outdoor
west it did not greatly distress the d bar
lazy r riders to lose part of their pay-
checks even if it had their spirits would
have been unimpaired for it is written in
their code that a man must take his punish-
ment without whining what hurt was
that they had been tricked led like lambs
to the killing none of them doubted now
that the packhorse of the gamblers was a
ringer these men had deliberately
crossed the path of the trail-outfit in order
to take from the vaqueros their money

  the punchers were sulky instead of a
fair race they had been up against an open-
and-shut proposition as russell phrased it
the jeers of doble did not improve their
tempers the man was temperamentally
mean-hearted he could not let his victims
alone

  they say ones born every minute ad
dawged if i dont believe it he sneered

  miller was not saying much himself but
his fat stomach shook at this sally if his
partner could goad the boys into more bet-
ting he was quite willing to divide the
profits

  audibly hart yawned and murmured his
sentiments aloud im liable to tell these
birds what i think of them steve if they
dont spend quite some time layin offm
us

  dont tell us out loud we might hear
you advised doble insolently

  in regards to that id sure worry if you
did

  dave was at that moment returning to
his place with a cup of hot coffee by some
perverse trick of fate his glance at that

the blue

moment fell on dobles sinister face of
malignant triumph his self-control
snapped and in an instant the whole course
of his life was deflected from the path it
would otherwise have taken with a flip
he tossed up the tin cup so that the hot
coffee soused the crook

   goddelmighty  screamed doble leap-
 ing to his feet

   he reached for his forty-five just as
 sanders closed with him the range-riders
 revolver like that of most of his fellows
 was in a blanket roll in the wagon

   miller with surprising agility for a fat
 man got to his feet and launched himself
 at the puncher dave flung the smaller of
 his opponents back against steve who
 was sitting tailor-fashion beside him the
 gunman tottered and fell over russell who
 lost no time in pinning his hands to the
 ground while hart deftly removed the re-
 volver from his pocket

   swinging round to face miller dave saw
 at once that the big man had chosen not
 to draw his gun in spite of his fat the
 gambler was a rough-and-tumble fighter of
 parts the extra weight had come in re-
 cent years but underneath it lay roped
 muscles and heavy bones men often re-
 marked that they had neverseen a fat man
 who could handle himself like ad miller

the two clinched dave had the under
hold and tried to trip his bulkier foe
the other sidestepped circling round he
got one hand under the boys chin and
drove it up and back flinging the range-
rider a dozen yards

   instantly dave plunged at him he had
 to get at close quarters for he could not tell
 when miller would change his mind and
 elect to fight with a gun the man had
 chosen a hand-to-hand tussle dave knew
 because he was sure he could beat so
 stringy an opponent as himself once he
 got the grip on him that he wanted the big
 gambler would crush him by sheer
 strength so though the youngster had to
 get close he dared not clinch his judg-
 ment was that ifis best bet was his fists

   he jabbed at the big white face ducked
 and jabbed again now he was in the shine
 of the moon now he was in darkness a
 red streak came out on the white face op-
 posite and he knew he had drawn blood
 miller roared like a bull and flailed away
 at him more than one heavy blow jarred
 him sent a bolt of pain shooting through
 him
book magazine

  the only thing he saw was that shining
face he pecked away at it with swift
jabs taking what punishment he must and
dodging the rest

  miller was furious he had intended
to clean up this bantam in about a minute
he rushed again broke through daves
defense and closed with him his great
arms crushed into the ribs of his lean op-
ponent as they swung round and round
dave gasped for breath he twisted and
squirmed trying to escape that deadly hug
somehow he succeeded in tripping his huge
foe

  they went down locked together dave
underneath the puncher knew that if he
had room miller would hammer his face to
a pulp he drew himself close to the bar-
rel body arms and legs wound tight like
hoops

  miller gave a yell of pain instinctively
dave moved his legs higher and clamped
them tighter the yell rose again became
a scream of agony

  lemme loose shrieked the man on
top my gawd youre killin me

  dave had not the least idea what was
disturbing millers peace of mind but
whatever it was moved to his advantage
he clamped tighter working his heels into
another secure position the big man bel-
lowed with pain take him off take him
off he implored in shrill crescendo

  whats all this demanded an im-
perious voice

vailler was torn howling from the arms
and legs that bound him and dave
found himself jerked roughly to his feet
the big raw-boned foreman was glaring
at him above his large hook nose the
trail-boss had been out at the remnda with
the jingler when the trouble began he
had arrived in time to rescue his fat friend

  whats eatin you sanders he de-
manded again curtly

  he jumped george yelped miller

  breathing hard dave faced his foe
warily he was in a better strategic posi-
tion than he had been for he had jerked
the revolver of the fat man from its scab-
bard just as they were dragged apart it
was in his right hand now pressed close
to his hip ready for instant use if need be
he could see without looking that george
doble was still struggling ineffectively in
the grip of russell

  dave stumbled and spilt some coffee
on george then george he tried to gun

by william macleod raine

him miller mixed in then explained
hart

  the foreman glared none of this stuff
while youre on the trail with my outfit
get that sanders i wont have it
dave he couldnt hep hissef buck
byington broke in they was runnin on
him considerable dug

  i aint asking for excuses im tellin
you boys whats what retorted the road-
boss sanders give him his gun

  the cowpuncher took a step backward
he had no intention of handing a loaded
gun to miller while the gambler was in his
present frame of mind that would be
equivalent to suicide he broke the re-
volver turned the cylinder and shook out
the cartridges the empty weapon he
tossed on the ground

  he ripped me with his spurs miller
said sullenly to the foreman thats how
i come to turn him loose

  dave looked down at the mans legs
his trousers were torn to shreds blood
trickled down the lacerated calves where
the spurs had roweled the flesh cruelly no
wonder miller had suddenly lost interest in
the fight the vaquero thanked his lucky
stars that he had not taken off his spurs
this evening and left them with the saddle

the first thing that dave did then was
to strike straight for the wagon where
his roll of bedding was he untied the
rope flung open the blankets and took
from inside them the forty-five he carried
to shoot rattlesnakes this he shoved down
between his shirt and trousers where it
would be handy for use in case of need
his roll he brought back with him as a
justification for the trip to the wagon he
had no intention of starting anything all
he wanted was not to be caught at a disad-
vantage a second time

  miller and the two dobles were stand-
ing a little way apart talking together in
low tones the fat man his foot on the
spoke of a wagon-wheel was tying up one
of his bleeding calves with a bandanna
handkerchief dave gathered that his con-
tribution to the conversation consisted
mainly of fervent and almost tearful pro-
fanity

  the brothers appeared to be debating
some point with heat george insisted and
the foreman gave up with a lift of his big
shoulders

  have it yore own way i hate to have
you leave us after i tell vou therell be no
gun-sight pass

more trouble but if thats how you feel
about it i got nothing to say what i want
understood is this-dug doble raised his
voice for all to hear-that im boss of
this outfit and wont stand for any rough
stuff if the boys or any of em cant
lose their money without belly-achin they
can get their time pronto

  the two gamblers packed their race-
horse saddled and rode away without a
word to any of the range-riders the men
round the fire gave no sign that they knew
the confidence men were on the map until
after they had gone then tongues began
to wag the foreman having gone to the
edge of the camp with them

  well my feelins aint hurt one lil bit
because they wont play with us no more
steve russell said smiling broadly

  can you blame that fat guy for not
wantin to play with dave here asked
hart and he beamed at the memory of
what he had seen son you cetainly gave
him one surprise party when yore rowels
dug in

  wonder to me he didnt stampede the
cows way he hollered grinned a third
i dont grudge him my ten plunks not
none dave he give me my moneys
worth that last round

  i had a little luck admitted dave
modestly but cheerfully

  betcha agreed steve i was just
starting over to haul the fat guy off dave
when he began bleatin for us to come help
him turn loose the bear i kinda took my
time then

  oncet i went to a play called alls
well that ends well  said byington
reminiscently at the tabor grand
the-a-ter in denver

  did it tell how a freckled cow-punch
rode a fat tinhorn on his spurs asked
hart

  bet he wears stove-pipes on his laigs
next time he mixes it with dave sug-
gested one coffee-brown youth well
looks like the shows over for tonight
im gonna roll in

  motion carried unanimously

chapter iv
the paint hoss disappears

wakened by the gong dave lay
luxurious in the warmth of his
blankets it was not for several
moments that he remembered the fight or

the blue

what brought it about the grin that lighted
his boyish face at thought of its unex-
pected conclusion was a fleeting one for
he discovered that it hurt his face to smile
briskly he rose and grunted ouch  his
sides were sore from the rib-squeezing of
millers powerful arms

  byington walked out to the remuda with
him hows the man-tamer this moning
he asked of dave

  fine and dandy old lizard

  you sure got the dead wood on him
when yore spurs got into action a mans
like a watermelon you caint tell how
good he is till you thump him miller is
right biggity and they say hes sudden
death with a gun but when it come down
to cases he hadnt the guts to go through
and stand the gaff

  hes been living soft too long dont
you reckon

  no sir he just didnt have the sand
in his craw to hang on and finish you off
whilst you was rippin up his laigs

  dave roped off his mount and rode out
to meet chiquito the pinto was an
aristocrat ill his way - he preferred to
choose his company was a little disdain-
ful of the cowpony that had no accomplish-
ments usually he grazed a short distance
from the remuda together with one of bob
harts string the two ponies had been
brought up in the same bunch

  this morning daves whistle brought no
whinny of joy no thud of hoofs galloping
out of the darkness to him he rode
deeper into the desert no answer came to
his calls at a canter he cut across the
plain to the wrangler that young man
had seen nothing of chiquito since the
evening before but this was not at all
unusual -

  the cowpuncher returned to camp for
breakfast and got permission of the fore-
man to look for the missing horses

  beyond the flats was a country creased
with draws and dry arroyos from one to
another of these dave went without find-
ing a trace of the animals all day he
pushed through cactus and mesquite heavy
with gray dust in the late afternoon he
gave up for the time and struck back to
the flats it was possible that the lost
broncos had rejoined the remuda of their
own accord or had been found by some of
the riders gathering up strays

  dave struck the herd-trail and followed
it toward the new camp a horseman came
out of the golden west of the sunset to
book magazine

meet him for a long time he saw the fig-
ure rising and falling jn the saddle the
pony moving in the even fox-trot of the
cattle country

  the man was bob hart

  found em shouted dave when he
was close enough to be heard

  no and we wont-not this side of ma-
lapi those scalawags didnt make camp
last night they kep travelin if you
ask me theyre moving yet and theyve
got our broncs with them

  this had already occurred to dave as a
possibility any proof he asked quietly

  a plenty i been xidin on the point all
day three or four times we cut trail of
five horses two of the five are being
ridden my four bits hoss has got a
broken front hoof so has one of the five
moving fast are they

  youre damn whistlin theyre hiv-
ing off for parts unknown-malapi first
off looks like they got friends there
steelman and his outfit will protect
them while they hunt cover and make a
get-away miller mentioned denver before
tiie race-said he was figurin on going
there maybe-

  he was probably lying you cant tell
point is weve got to get busy my no-
tion is wed better make a bee line for ma-
lapi right away proposed bob

  well travel all night no use wasting
any more time

fug doble received their decision
sourly it dont tickle me a heap to
be left short-handed because you two boys
have got an excuse to get to town quicker
hart looked him straight in the eye
call it an excuse if you want to were
after a pair of shorthorn crooks that stole
our horses

  the foreman flushed angrily dont
come belly-achin to me about yore broom-
tails i aint got em

  we know whos got em said dave
evenly what we want is a wage-check
so as we can cash it at malapi

  you dont get it returned the big fore-
man bluntly we pay off when we reach
the end of the drive

  i notice you paid yore brother and
miller when we gave an order for it hart
retorted with heat

  a different proposition they hadnt
signed up for this drive like you boys did
youll get whats coming to you when i
pay off the others and not before

by william macleod raine



  the two riders retired sulkily they felt
it was not fair but on the trail the foreman
is an autocrat from the other riders they
borrowed a few dollars and gave in ex-
change orders on their pay-checks

  within an hour they were on the road
fresh horses had been roped from the
remuda and were carrying them at an even
spanish jog-trot through the night the
stars came out clear and steady above a
ghostly world at sleep the desert was a
place of mystery of vast space peopled by
strange and misty shapes

  the plain stretched vaguely before
them far away was the thin outline of
the range which inclosed the valley the
riders held their course by means of that
trained sixth sense of direction their occu-
pation had developed they spoke little
once a coyote bowled dismally from the
edge of the mesa but for the most part
there was no sound except the shuffling of
the horses accouterment and the occasional
ring of a hoof on the baked ground

  the gray dawn sifting into the sky
found them still traveling the moun-
tains came closer grew more definite the
desert flamed again dry lifeless torrid
beneath a sky of turquoise dust-eddies
whirled in inverted cones wind-devils play-
ing spirals across the sand table lands
mesas wide plains desolate lava stretches
-each in turn was traversed by the riders

  they reached the foothills and left be-
hind the desert shimmering in the dancing
heat in the deep gorge where the hill
creases gave them shade the punchers
drew off the trail unsaddled hobbled
their horses and stole a few hours sleep

  in the late afternoon they rode back to
the trail through a draw the ponies wading
fetlock-deep in yellow red blue and purple
flowers the mountains across the valley
looked in the dry heat as though made of
papier mache closer at hand the undu-
lations of sandhills stretched toward the
pass for which they were making a mule
deer started out of a dry wash and fled
into the sunset light the long stratified
faces of rock escarpments caught the glow
of the sun and became battlemented towers
of ancient story

  the riders climbed steadily now no
longer engulfed in the ground-swell of land
waves they breathed an air like wine
strong pure bracing presently their way
led them into a hill pocket which ran into
a gorge forested with pinons stretching
toward gunsight pass
gun-sight pass

  the stars were out again when they
looked down from the other side of the
pass upon the lights of malapi

chapter v
supper at delmonicos interrupted

the two d bar lazy r punchers ate
supper at delmonicos the res-
taurant was owned by wong chung
a cantonese celestial did the cooking and
another waited on table the price of a
meal was twenty-five cents regardless of
what one ordered

  hop lee the waiter grinned at the
frolicsome youths with the serenity of a
world-old wisdom

  bleef steak plork chop lamb chop
hlamneggs clorn bleef hash splanish
stew he chanted reciting the entire bill
of fare

  yes murmured bob

  the waiter said his piece again

  listens good to me agreed dave
lead it to us

  you takee two-bleef steak and hlam-
neggs mebbe suggested hop helpfully

  thas right two orders of everything
on the meenyou charley

 hop did not argue with them he
never argued with a customer if they
stormed at him he took refuge in a sud-
denly acquired lack of understanding of
english if they called him charley or
john or one lung he accepted the name
cheerfully and laid it to a racial mental
deficiency of the melicans now he de-
cided to make a selection himself

  vely well bleef steak and hlam-
neggs

  fried potatoes done brown john
flied plotatoes tea or cloffee
coffee decided dave for both aof
them warm mine

  and custard pie added bob made
from this years crop

  vely well hop lees impassive face
betrayed no perplexity as he departed in
the course of a season he waited on hun-
dreds of wild men from the hills drunk
and sober

  dave helped himself to bread from a
plate stacked high with thick slices he
buttered it and began to eat hart did
the same at delmonicos nobody ever
waited till the meal was served or for
plates for that matter

the blue

    jout to attack a second slice dave
stopped to stare at his companion
hart was looking past his shoulder with
alert intentness dave turned his head
two men leaving the restaurant were pay-
ing the cashier

  they just stepped outa that booth to
the right whispered bob

  the men were george doble and a cow-
puncher known as shorty a broad heavy-
set little man who worked for bradley
steelman owner of the rocking horse
ranch what time he was not engaged on
nefarious business of his own he was
wearing a chihuahua hat and leather chaps
with silver conchas

  at this moment hop lee arrived with 
dinner

  dave sighed as he grinned at his friend
i need that supper in my system i sure
do but i reckon i dont get it

  you do not old lizard agreed hart
ill say doble is the most inconsiderate
guy i ever did trail why couldnt he of
showed up a half-hour later dad gum his
ornery hide

  they paid their bill over the counter and
passed into the street immediately the
sound of a clear high voice arrested their
attention it vibrated indignation and
dread

  what have you done with my father
came sharply to them on the wings of the
soft night wind

  a young woman was speaking she was
in a buggy and was talking to two men on
the sidewalk-the two men who had pre-
ceded the range-riders out of the restaurant

  why miss we aint done a thing to
him-nothin a-tall the man shorty
was speaking and in a tone of honeyed
conciliation it was quite plain he did not
want a scene on the street

  thats a lie the voice of the girl
broke for an instant to a sob do you
think i dont know youre brad steel-
mans handy man that you do his mean-
ness for him when he snaps his fingers

  you sure do click yore heels mighty
loud miss dave caught in that soft
answer the purr of malice he remem-
bered now hearing from buck byington
that years ago emerson crawford had
rounded up evidence to send shorty to the
penitentiary for rebranding through a
blanket i reckon you come by it hon-
est em always acted like he was god al-
mighty

  where is he whats become of him
book magazine

  is yore paw missin im right sorry
to hear that the cowpuncher countered
with suave irony he was eager to be gone
his glance followed doble who was mov-
ing slowly down the street

  the girls face white and shining in the
moonlight leaned out of the buggy toward
the retreating vaquero dont you dare
hurt my father dont you dare she
warned the words choked in her tense
throat

  shorty continued to back away youre
excited miss you go home an think it
over reasonable youll be sorry you
talked this away to me he said with unct-
uous virtue

  then swiftly he turned and went
straddling down the walk his spurs jing-
ling music as he moved

quickly dave gave directions to his
friend duck back into the restau-
rant bob get a pocket full of dry rice
from the chink trail those birds to their
nest and find where they roost then stick
around like a burr scatter rice behind
you and ill drift along later first off
i got to stay and talk with miss joyce
and say take along a rope might need it

  an instant later hart was in the restau-
rant commandeering rice and sanders was
lifting his dusty hat to the young lady in
the buggy

  if i can hep you any miss joyce-
he said diffidently

  beneath dark and delicate brows she
frowned at him who are you

  dave sanders my name is i reckon
you never heard tell of me i punch cows
for yore father

  her luminous hazel-brown eyes steadied
in his read thehonesty of his simple boyish
heart

  you heard what i said to that man
  part of it

  well its true i know it is though i
cant prove it

  bob hart moving swiftly down the
street waved a hand at his friend as he
passed without turning his attention from
joyce crawford dave acknowledged the
signal

  how do you know it

  steelmans men have been watching our
house they were hanging around at dif-
ferent times the day before yesterday this
man shorty was one

  any special reason for the feud to
break out right now

by william macleod raine

  father was going to prove up a claim
this week-the one that takes in the tula-
rosa water-holes you know the trouble
theyve had about it-how they kept break-
ing our fences to water their sheep and
cattle dont you think theyre trying to
keep him from proving up

  maybe so when did you see him
last

  her lip trembled night before last
after supper he started for the cattlemans
club but he never got there

  sure he wasnt called out to one of the
ranches unexpected

  i sent out to make sure he hasnt been
seen there

  looks like some of brad steelmans
smooth work admitted dave if he
could work yore father to sign a relin-
quishment-

  fire flickered in her eye hed ought
to know dad better

  thats right too but brad needs them
water-holes in his business bad without
em he loses the whole round top range
he might take a crack at turning the screws
on yore father

  you dont think- she stopped to
fight back a sob that filled her soft throat

tave was not sure what he thought but
 he answered cheerfully and instantly
no i dont reckon theyve dry-gulched
him or anything emerson crawford is one
sure enough husky citizen he couldnt
either be shot or rough-housed in town
without some one hearin the noise whats
more it wouldnt be their play to injure
him but to force a relinquishment
thats true you believe that dont
you miss joyce cried eagerly

  sure i do and dave discovered that
his argument or his hopes had for the mo-
ment convinced him now the question
is whats to be done

  yes she admitted and the childish
tremor of the sweet lips told him that she
depended upon him to work out the prob-
lem his heart swelled with glad pride
at the thought

  that man who jus passed is my
friend he told her hes trailin that
duck shorty like as not well find out
whats stirrin

  ill go with you the girl said vivid
lips parted in anticipation

  no youll go home this is a mans
job soon as i find out anything ill let
you know
gun-sight pass

  youll come no matter what time o
night it is she pleaded

  yes he promised

  her firm little hand rested a moment in
his brown palm im depending on you
she murmured in a whisper lifted to a low
wail by a stress of emotion

chapter vi
by way of a window

the trail of rice led down mission
street turned at junipero crossed
into an alley and trickled along a
dusty road to the outskirts of the frontier
town

  the responsibility joyce had put upon
dave uplifted him he had followed the
horse-race gamblers to town on a purely
selfish undertaking but he had been caught
in a cross-current and was being swept into
dangerous waters for the sake of another
doble and miller were small fish in the
swirl of this more desperate venture dave
knew brad steelman by sight and by repu-
tation the mans coffee-brown hatchet
face his restless black eyes the high nar-
row shoulders the slope of nose and chin
combined somehow to give him the look
of a wily and predaceous wolf the boy
had never met anyone who so impressed
him with a sense of ruthless rapacity he
was audacious and deadly in attack but
always he covered his tracks cunningly
suspected of many crimes he had been
proved guilty of none it was a safe bet
that now he had a line of retreat worked
out in case his plans went awry

  a soft low whistle stayed his feet from
behind a greasewood bush bob rose and
beckoned him dave tiptoed to him both
of them crouched behind cover while they
whispered

  the dobe house over to the right
said bob i been up and tried to look in
but they got curtains drawn i would of
liked to seen how many gents are present
nothin doing its a strictly private
party

  dave told him what he had learned from
the daughter of emerson crawford

  might make a gather of boys and raid
the joint suggested hart

  bad medicine bob our works got to
be smoother than that how do we know
they got the old man a prisoner there
what excuse we got for attackin a peace-
able house a friend of mines brother

the blue

oncet got shot up makin a similar mistake
maybe crawfords there maybe he aint
say he is all right theres some gun-
play back and forth like as not a biling
of men pour outa the place we go in
and find the old man with a bullet right
spang through his forehead well aint
that too tad in the rookus his own
punchers rnusta gunned him accidental
how would that story listen in court

  it wouldnt listen good to me how-
come crawford to be a prisoner there id
want to know

  sure you would and steelman would
have witnesses to swear the old man had
just drapped in to see if they couldnt talk
things over and make a settlement of their
troubles

  all right whats yore program then
asked bob

  darned if i know say we scout the
ground over first

they made a wide circuit and ap-
proached the house from the rear
worming their way through the indian
grass toward the back door dave crept
forward and tried the door it was locked
the window was latched and the blind low-
ered he drew back and rejoined his com-
panion

  no chance there he whispered

  how about the roof asked hart

  it was an eight-roomed house of fairly
modem construction from the roof two
dormers jutted no light issued from
either of them

  daves eyes lighted

  whats the matter with taking a whirl
at it his partner continued youre top
hand with a rope

  suits me fine

  the young puncher arranged the coils
carefully and whirled the loop around his
head to get the feel of the throw it would
not do to miss the first cast and let the
rope fall dragging down the roof some
one might hear and come out to investi-
gate

  the rope snaked forward and up
settled gracefully over the chimney and
tightened round it close to the shingles

  good enough now me for the climb
murmured hart

  dont pull yore picket-pin bob me
first

  all right we aint time to debate
shag up old scout

  dave slipped off his high-heeled boots
book magazine



and went up hand over hand using his feet
against the rough adobe walls to help in
the ascent when he came to the eaves
he threw a leg up and clambered to the
roof in another moment he was huddled
against the chimney waiting for his com-
panion

  as soon as hart had joined him he
pulled up the rope and wound it round the
chimney

  you stay here while i see whats doin
dave proposed

  i never did see such a fellow for hoggin
all the fun objected bob aint you go-
in to leave me trail along

  got to play a lone hand till we find out
where were at bob doubles the chances
of being bumped into if we both go

  then you roost on the roof and lemme
look the range over for the old man
didnt miss joyce tell me to find her
paw whats eatin you old-timer

  you pore plugged nickel derided
hart think she picked you special for
this job do you

  be reasonable bob pleaded dave

  his friend gave way cut yore stick
then holler for me when im wanted

  dave moved down the roof to the nearest
dormer the house he judged had orig-
inally belonged to a well-to-do mexican
family and had later been rebuilt upon
american ideas the thick adobe walls
had come down from the earlier owners
but the roof had been put on as a substitute
for the flat one of its first incarnation

the range-rider was wearing plain shiny
 leather chaps with a gun in an open
holster tied at the bottom to facilitate
quick action he drew out the revolver
tested it noiselessly and restored it care-
fully to its place if he needed the six-
shooter at all he would need it very badly
and very suddenly

  gingerly he tested the window of the
dormer working at it from the side so that
his body would not be visible to anybody
who happened to be watching from within
apparently it was latched he crept
across the roof to the other dormer

  it was a casement window and at the
touch of the hand it gave way the heart
of the cowpuncher beat fast with excite-
ment in the shadowy darkness of that
room death might be lurking its hand al-
ready outstretched toward him he peered
in accustoming his eyes to the blackness

a prickling of the skin ran over him the

by william macleod raine

tiny cold feet of mice pattered up and
down his spine for he knew that though
he could not yet make out the objects in-
side the room his face must be like a
framed portrait to anybody there

  he made out presently that it was a bed-
room with sloping ceiling a bunk with
blankets thrown back just as the sleeper
had left them filled one side of the cham-
ber there were two chairs a washstand
a small looking-glass and a chromo or two
on the wall a sawed-off shotgun was
standing in a corner here and there were
scattered soiled clothing and stained boots
the door was ajar but nobody was in the
room

  dave eased himself over the sill and
waited for a moment while he listened the
revolver in his hand it seemed to him
that he could hear a faint murmur of
voices but he was not sure he moved
across the bare plank floor slid through
the door and again stopped to take stock
of his surroundings

  he was at the head of a stairway which
ran down to the first floor and lost itself in
the darkness of the hall leaning over
the banister he listened intently for any
sign of life below he was sure now that
he heard the sound of low voices behind a
closed door

  the cow-puncher hesitated should he
stop to explore the upper story or should
he go down at once and try to find out
what those voices might tell him it might
be that time was of the essence of his con-
tract to discover what had become of
emerson crawford he decided to look
for his information on the first floor

  never before had dave noticed that
stairs creaked and groaned so loudly be-
neath the pressure of a soft footstep they
seemed to shout his approach though he
took every step with elaborate precaution
a door slammed somewhere and his heart
jumped to the sound of it he did not hide
the truth from himself if steelman or
his men found him here looking for craw-
ford he would never leave the house alive

i-iis foot left the last tread and found

	the uncarpeted floor he crept hand
outstretched toward the door behind which
he heard men talking as he moved for-
ward his stomach-muscles tightened at
any moment some one might come out of
the room and walk into him

  he put his eye to the keyhole and
through it saw a narrow segment of the
gun-sight pass	the blue



room ad miller was sitting astride
a chair his elbows on the back another
man one not visible to the cowpuncher
was announcing a decision and giving an
order

  hook up the horses shorty hes got
his neck bowed and he wont sign all
right ill get the dum fool up in the hills
and show him whether he will or wont

  i could of told you he had sand in his
craw shorty was speaking he too was
beyond the range of daves vision em
crawford wont sign unless hes a mind to

  take my advice brad collect the
kid and youll sure have em hog-tied he
sets the world an all by her ybetcha
hell talk turkey then predicted miller

  are we fightin kids the squat
puncher wanted to know

  did i ask your advice shorty in-
quired steelman acidly

  the range-rider grumbled in an indis-
tinct answer dave did not make out the
words and his interest in the conversation
abruptly ceased

  for from upstairs there came the sud-
den sounds of trampling feet of bodies
thrashing to and fro in conflict a re-
volver-shot barked its sinister menace

  dave rose to go at the same time the
door in front of him was jerked open he
pushed his forty-five into millers fat ribs

  whats yore hurry stick up yore
hands-stick em up

  the boy was backing along the passage
as he spoke he reached the newel-post in
that second while miller was being flung
aside by an eruption of men from the
room like a frightened rabbit dave
leaped for the stairs taking them three at
a time halfway up he collided with a
man flying down they came together with
the heavy impact of fast-moving bodies
the two collapsed and rolled down one
over the other

  sanders rose like a rubber ball the
other man lay still he had been put out
cold daves head had struck him in the
solar plexus and knocked the breath out of
him the young cow-puncher found him-
self the active center of a cyclone his
own revolver was gone he grappled with
a man seizing him by the wrist to prevent
the use of a long-barreled revolver the
trigger fell a bullet flying through the
ceiling

  other men pressed about him trying to
reach him with their fists and to strike him
with their weapons their high heels

crushed cruelly the flesh of his stockinged
feet the darkness befriended dave in
the massed melee they dared not shoot for
fear of hitting the wrong mark nor could
they always be sure which shifting figure
was the enemy

  dave clung close to the man he had
seized using him as a shield against the
others the pack swayed down the hall
into the wedge of light thrown by the lamp
in the room

  across the head of the man next him
shorty reached and raised his arm dave
saw the blue barrel of the revolver sweep-
ing down but could not free a hand to pro-
tect himself a jagged pain shot through
his head the power went out of his legs
he sagged at the hinges of his knees he
stumbled and went down heavy boots
kicked him where he lay it seemed to
him that bolts of lightning were zigzagging
through him

  the pain ceased and he floated away
into a sea of space

chapter vii
bob hart takes a hand

bob hart waited till his friend had
disappeared into the house before he
moved

  thought hect run it over me so id
roost here on the roof did he well im
after the ol hom-toad full jump the
puncher murmured a grin on his good-
looking face

  he too examined his gun before he fol-
lowed dave through the dormer window
and passed into the frowsy bedchamber
none of the details of it escaped his cool
keen gaze least of all the sawed-off shotgun
in the corner

  that scatter-gun might come handy
reckon ill move it sos ill know just
where its at when i need it he said to
himself and carried the gun to the bed
where he covered it with a quilt

  at the top of the stairs bob also hesi-
tated before passing down why not be
sure of his line of communications with the
roof before going too far he did not want
to be in such a hurry that his retreat would
be cut off

  with as little noise as possible bob ex-
plored the upper story the first room in
which he found himself was empty of all
furniture except a pair of broken-backed
chairs one casual glance was enough
book magazine

is

  he was about to try a second door when
some one spoke he recognized the voice

it belonged to the man who wrote his pay-
checks and it came from jin adjoining
room

  always knew you was crooked as a
dogs hind laig doble never liked you
a lick in the road ill say this some day
ill certainly hang yore hide up to dry for
yore treachery

  no use to get on the peck em it
dont do you no good to make me sore
maybe youll need a friend before youre
shet of brad

  it relieves my mind some to tell you
what a yellow coyote you are explained
the cattleman you got about as much
sand as a brush rabbit and id trust you
as far as i would a rattler you damned
sidewinder

  bob tried the door the knob turned in
his hand and the door slowly opened in-
ward

  the rattle of the latch brought george
doble sly shifty eye round he was ex-
pecting to see one of his friends from be-
low a stare of blank astonishment gave
way to a leaping flicker of fear the crook
jumped to his feet tugging at his gun be-
fore he could fire the range-rider had
closed with him

  the plunging attack drove doble back
against the table a flimsy round-topped
affair which gave way beneath this assault
upon it the two men went down in the
wreck doble squirmed away like a cat
but before he could turn to use his revolver
bob was on him again the puncher
caught his right arm in time and in no
more than time the deflected bullet
pinged through a looking-glass on a dresser
near the foot of the bed

  go to it son grab the gun and bust
his haid wide open an excited voice en-
couraged hart

dut doble clung to his weapon as a lost
cow does to a dobe water-hole in the
desert bob got a grip on his arm and
twisted till he screamed with pain he
did a head spin and escaped one hun-
dred and sixty pounds of arizona cow-
puncher landed on his midriff and the
six-shooter went clattering away to a far
comer of the room

  bob dived for the revolver doble for
the door a moment and hart had the
gun -but whereas there had been three in
the room there were now but two

by william macleod raine

  a voice from the bed spoke in curt com-
mand cut me loose bob had heard
that voice on more than one round-up it
was that of emerson crawford

  the range-riders sharp knife cut the
ropes that tied the hands and feet of his
employer he worked in the dark and it
took time

  who are you how come you here
demanded the cattleman

  im bob hart its quite a story miss
joyce sent me and dave sanders an-
swered the young man still busy with the
ropes

  from below came the sound of a shot
the shuffling of many feet

  must be him downstairs

  i reckon theys a muley gun in the
hall

  crawford stretched his cramped muscles
flexing and reflexing his arms and legs
get it son well drift down and sit in

  when bob returned he found the big
cattleman examining dobles revolver he
broke the shotgun to make sure it was
loaded

  then well travel he said coolly

  the battle-sounds downstairs had died
away from the landing they looked down
into the hall and saw a bar of light that
came through a partly open door raised
voices were lifted in excitement

  one of crawfords riders some one
was saying a whole passle of em must
be round the place

  came the thud of a boot on something
soft put the damn spy outa business i
say broke in another angrily

  harts gorge rose thas miller he
whispered to his chief hes kickin dave
now hes down because dave whaled him
good

  softly the two men padded down the
stair-treads and moved along the passage

  whos that demanded shorty thrust-
ing his head into the hall stay right
there or ill shoot

  oh no you wont answered the cat-
tleman evenly im coming into that
room to have a settlement therell be
no shooting-unless i do it

  his step did not falter he moved for-
ward brushed shorty aside and strode into
the midst of his enemies

jpave lay on the floor his hair was
clotted with blood and a thin stream
of it dripped from his head the men
grouped round his body had their eyes
gun-sight pass

focused on the man who had just pushed
his way in all of them were armed but
not one of them made a move to attack

  for there is something about a strong
man unafraid more potent than a company
of troopers such a man was emerson
crawford now his life might be hanging
in the balance of his enemies fears but
he gave no sign of uncertainty his steady
gray eyes swept the circle rested on each
worried face and fastened on brad steel-
man

  the two had been enemies for years
rivals for control of the range and for
leadership in the community before that
as young men they had been candidates
for the hand of the girl that the better one
had won the sheepman was shrewd and
cunning but he had no such force of char-
acter as crawford at the bottom of his
heart though he seethed with hatred he
quailed before that level gaze did his foe
have the house surrounded with his range-
riders did he mean to make him pay
with his life for the thing he had done

  steelman laughed uneasily an option
lay before him he could fight or he
could throw up the hand he had dealt him-
self from a stacked deck if he let his
enemy walk away scot free some day he
would have to pay crawford with interest
his choice was a characteristic one

  well i reckon youve kinda upset my
plans em course i was a-coddin you
i didnt aim to hurt you none though id
a-liked to have talked you outa the water-
holes

  the big cattleman ignored this abso-
lutely have a team hitched right away
shorty will tend to that bob tie up yore
friends haid with a handkerchief

  without an instants hesitation hart
thrust his revolver back into its scabbard
he was willing to trust crawford to dom-
inate this group of lawless foes every one
of whom held some deep grudge against
him one he had sent to the penitentiary
another he had actually kicked out of his
employ a third was in his debt for many
injuries received almost any of them
would have shot him in the back on a
dark night but none had the cold nerve
to meet him in the open for even in a
land which bred men there were few to
match emerson crawford

  shorty looked at steelman im wait-
in brad he said

 the sheepman nodded sullenly you
done heard your orders shorty

the blue



the ex-convict reached for his steeple
 hat thrust his revolver back into its
scabbard and went jingling from the room
he looked insolently at crawford as he
passed

  different here if it was my say-so
id go through

  hart administered first aid to his friend
im servin notice miller that some day
ill bust you wide and handsome for this
he said looking straight at the fat gam-
bler you have given dave a raw deal
and youll not get away with it

  i pack a gun come a-shootin when
youre ready retorted miller

  thas liable to be right soon you damn
horsethief weve rid most a hundred
miles to have a lil talk with you and yore
pardner there

  shoutin about that race yet are you
if i wasnt a better loser than you-
dont bluff miller you know why
we trailed you

  doble edged into the talk he was still
short of wind but to his thick wits a
denial seemed necessary we aint got
yore broncs

  who mentioned our broncs hart de-
manded swiftly

  called ad a horsethief didnt you
so he is-you too youve got our
ponies not in yore vest pockets but hid
out in the brush somewheres im servin
notice right now that dave and me have
come to collect

pave opened his eyes upon a world
which danced hazily before him he
had a splitting headache

  whas the matter he asked

  you had a run-in with a bunch of
sheep-wranglers bob told him theyre
going to be plumb sorry they got gay
presently shorty returned that teams
hooked up he told the world at large

  youll drive us steelman announced
crawford

  me screamed the leader of the other
faction you got the most nerve i ever
did see

  sure drive him home brad advised
shorty with bitter sarcasm black his
boots wait on him good step lively
when yore new boss whistles he cackled
with splenetic laughter

  i dunno as i need to drive you home
steelman said slowly feeling his way to a
decision you know the way bettern i
do
book magazine



  the eyes of the two leaders met

  youll drive the cattleman repeated

  the weak spot in steelmans leadership
was that personally he was not game
crawford had a pungent personality he
was dynamic strong master of himself in
any emergency the sheepmans will melt-
ed before his insistence he dared not
face a showdown

  oh well whats it matter we can
talk things over on the way me im not
lookin for trouble none he said his small
black eyes moving restlessly to watch the
effect of this on his men

  bob helped his partner out of the house
and into the surrey the cattleman took
the seat beside steelman across his knees
the sawed-off shotgun he had brought
his enemy along for two reasons one
was to weaken his prestige with his own
men the other was to prevent them from
shooting at the rig as they drove away

  steelman drove in silence his heart
was filled with surging hatred during
that ride was bom a determination to have
nothing less than the life of his enemy
when the time should be ripe

  at the door of his house crawford dis-
missed him contemptuously get out you
yellow wolf

  the man with the reins spoke softly
venomously from a dry throat one o
these days youll crawl on your hands and
knees to me for this

  he whipped up the team and rattled
away furiously into the night

chapter viii
the d bar lazy r boys meet an angel

joyce came flying to her fathers arms
the white lace of a nightgown showed
beneath the dressing-robe she had
hurriedly donned a plait of dark hair
hung across her shoulder far below the
waist she threw herself at crawford with
a moaning little sob

  oh dad-dad-dad she cried and
her slender arms went round his neck

  its all right sweetheart yore old
dads not even powder-burnt you been
worryin a heap i reckon his voice was
full of rough tenderness

  she began to cry he patted her shoul-
der and caressed her dark head drawing
it close to his shoulder now-now-
now sweetheart dont you cry its all
right lil honeybug

by william macleod raine

  youre not-hurt she begged through
her tears

  not none-never was huskier but i
got a boy out here thats beat up some
come in dave-and you bob theyre
good boys joy i want you to meet em
both

  the girl had thought her father alone
she flung one startled glance into the night
clutched the dressing-gown closer round her
throat and fled her barefoot way into the
darkness of the house to the boys hang-
ing awkwardly at the gate the slim child-
woman was a vision wonderful

  her father laughed joy aint dressed
for callers come in boys

  he lighted a lamp and drew dave to a
lounge lemme look at yore haid son
bob you hotfoot it for doc green

  its nothing a-tall to make a fuss
about dave apologized only a love-
tap compliments of shorty and some kicks
in the slats kindness of mr miller

in spite of his debonair manner dave still
had a bad headache and was so sore
around the body that he could scarcely
move without groaning he kept his teeth
clamped on the pain because he had been
brought up in the outdoor code of the
west which demands of a man that he
grin and stand the gaff

  while the doctor was attending to daves
injuries the cow-puncher caught sight once
or twice of joyce at the door clad now in
a summer frock of white with a blue sash
she was busy supplying in a brisk com-
petent way the demands of the doctor for
hot and cold water and clean linen

  meanwhile crawford told his story i
was right close to the club when doble
met me he pulled a story of how his
brother dug had had trouble with steel-
man and got shot up i swallowed it hook
bait and sinker soon as i got into the
house they swarmed over me like bees
i didnt even get my six-gun out brad
wanted me to sign a relinquishment i
told him where he could head in at
what would have happened if the boys
hadnt dropped along asked doctor
green as he repacked his medicine-case

  the cattleman looked at him and his
eyes were hard and bleak why doc
yore guess is as good as mine he said

  mine is that youd a-been among the
missing em well im leaving a sleep-
ing-powder for the patient in case he
doesnt get to sleep in an hour or two in
gun-sight pass

the morning ill drop round again the
doctor said

  he did and found dave much improved
the clean outdoors of the rough-riding
west builds blood that is red a city man
might have kept his bed a week but dave
was up and ready to say good-by within
forty-eight hours he was still a bit under
par a trifle washed-out but he wanted to
take the road in pursuit of miller and
doble who had again decamped in a hurry
with the two horses they had stolen

  they had the broncs hid up frio
canon way i reckon explained hart
but they didnt take no chances when
they left that dobe house they lit a-nmnin
and dumb for the high hills on the jump
and they didnt leave no address neither
well be following a cold trail were not
liable to find them after they hole up in
some mountain pocket

  might never can tell les take a
whirl at it anyhow urged dave

  hate to give up yore paint hoss dont
you said bob with his friendly grin
aint blamin you none whatever id
sleep cm those fellows trail if chiquito was
mine what say we outfit in the mornin
and pull our freights

vthen joyce was in the room where
 dave lay on the lounge the young
man never looked at her but he saw no-
body else brought up in a saddle on the
range he had never before met a girl like
her it was not only that she was beau-
tiful and fragrant as apple blossoms a
mystery of maidenhood whose presence
awed his simple soul it was not only that
she seemed so delicately precious a prin-
cess of the blood royal set apart by reason
of her buoyant graces the soft rustle of
her skirts the fine texture of the satiny
skin what took him by the throat was
her goodness she was enshrined in his
heart as a young saint he would have
thought it sacrilege to think of her as a
wide-awake young woman subject to all the
vanities of her sex and he could have
cited evidence the sweetness of her af-
fection for rough em crawford the dear
maternal tenderness with which she ruled
her three-year-old brother keith mother-
less since the week of his birth the kind-
ness of the luminous brown eyes to the
uncouth stranger thrown upon her hospi-
tality dave treasured them all as signs
of angelic grace and they played upon his
heartstrings disturbingly

the blue



  joyce brought keith in to say good-by
to dave and his friend before they left
the little fellow ran across the room to his
new pal who had busied himself weaving
horsehair playthings for the youngster

  you turn back and make me a bwidle
dave he cried

  ill sure come or else send you one
the cow-puncher promised rising to meet
joyce

  she carried her slender figure across the
room with perfect ease and rhythm head
beautifully poised young seventeen as self-
possessed as thirty as much could not
be said for her guests they were all legs
and gangling arms red ears and dusty
boots

  yes we all want you to come back
she said with a charming smile i think
you saved fathers life we cant tell you
how much we owe you can we keith

  nope when will you send the bwi-
dle he demanded

  soon the restored patient said to the
boy and to her that wasnt nothin
a-tall from where i come from we always
been used to standin bjr our boss

  he shifted awkwardly to the other foot
flushing to the hair while he buried her
soft little hand in his big freckled one
the girl showed no shyness seventeen is
sometimes so much older than twenty

  thas what us d bar lazy r boys are
ridin with yore paws outfit for miss-to
be handy when he needs us bob added in
his turn were sure tickled we got a
chancet to go to brad steelmans party
im certainly glad to of met you miss
joyce he ducked his head and scraped
back a foot in what was meant to be a
bow

  emerson crawford sauntered in big and
bluff and easy-going hittin the trail
boys good enough hope you find the
thieves if you do play yore cards close
theyre treacherous devils dont take no
chances with em i left an order at the
store for you to draw on me for another
pair of boots in place of those you lost in
the brush dave get a good pair son
theyre on me well so long luck
boys ill look for you-all back with the d
bar lazy r when youve finished this
job

  the punchers rode away without looking
back but many times in the days that fol-
lowed their hearts turned to that roof which
had given the word home a new meaning to
them both

chapter ix

gun-sight pass

the pursuit took the riders across a
wide undulating plain above which
danced the dry heat of the desert
lizards sunned themselves on flat rocks
a rattlesnake slid toward the cover of a
prickly pear the bleached bones of a
cow shone white beside the trail

  the throats of the cowpunchers filled
with alkali dust and their eyes grew red
and sore from it magnificent mirages un-
folded themselves lakes cool and limpid
stretching to the horizon with inviting
forests in the distance an oasis of lush
green fields that covered miles mesquite
distorted to the size of giant trees and
cattle transformed into dinosaurs the
great gray desert took on freakish shapes
of erosion always hour after hour be-
neath a copper sky they rode in palpi-
tating heat through sand-drifts among the
salt bushes and the creosote into cow-
backed hills beyond which the stark moun-
tains rose

  out of the fiery furnace of the plain they
came in late afternoon to the uplands
plunging into a land of deep gorges and
great chasms here manzanita grew and
live oaks flourished they sent a white-
tail buck crashing through the brush into a
canon

  when night fell they built a fire of nig-
gerheads and after they had eaten found
its glow grateful for they were well up
in the hills now and the night air was
sharp

  in the sandy desert they had followed
easily the trail of the thieves but as they
had got into the hills the tracks had be-
come fainter and fewer the young men
discussed this while they lay in their blan-
kets in a water-gutted gulch not too near
the fire they had built

  like huntin for a needle in a hay-
stack said bob their trails done pe-
tered out they might be in any one of a
hundred pockets right close or they may
have bore way off to the right all they
got to do is hole up and not build any
fires

  fat chance we got admitted dave
unless they build a fire like we done
say id a heap rather be sleepin here than
by that niggerhead blaze tonight they
might creep up and try to gun us

  before they had been in the saddle an
hour next day the trail of the thieves was

lost the pursuers worked till sunset try-
ing to pick it up again the third day was
wasted in aimless drifting among the defiles
of the mountains

  no use bob said his friend while they
were cooking supper theyve made their
get-away might as well drift back to
malapi dont you reckon

  looks like were only wastin our
time here

  long before day broke they started
the canons below were filled with mist as
they rode down out of the mountains to-
ward the crystal dawn that already flooded
the plain the courthouse clock at malapi
said the time was midnight when the dust-
covered men and horses drew into the
town

hthe tired men slept till noon at the
delmonico restaurant they found buck
byington and steve russell the trail-
herd had been driven in an hour before

  hows old alkali asked dave of his
friend buck thumping him on the back

  jes tolable answered the old-timer
equably making great play with knife and
fork a man or a hawss dont either
amount to much after they oncet been
stove up since that bronc piled me at
willow creek i been mighty stiff you
might say

  dugs payin off today boys russell
told them youll find him round to the
boston emporium

  the foreman settled first with hart then
he turned to the page on his pocket note-
book that held the account of sanders

  youve drew one months pay that
leaves you three months less the week
youve fooled away after the pinto
crect admitted dave

  ill dock you seven and a half for that
three times thirtys ninety take seven
and a half from that leaves eighty-two
fifty

  hold on objected dave my pays
thirty-five a month

  first i knew of it said the foreman
eyes bleak and harsh thirtys what youre
gettin

  i came in as top hand at thirty-five
  you did not denied doble flatly

  the young man flushed you cant run
that on me dug ill not stand for it
eighty-two fifty is what you get an-
swered the other dogmatically you can
take it or go to hell

  he began to sort out a number of small
gun-sight pass

checks with which to pay the puncher at
that time the currency of the country con-
sisted largely of cattlemens checks which
passed from hand to hand till they were
grimy with dirt often these were not
cashed for months

  well see what the old man says about
that retorted dave hotly it was in his
mind to say that he did not intend to be
robbed by both the doble brothers but
he wisely repressed the impulse dug
would as soon fight as eat and the young
rider knew he would not have a chance in
the world against him

  all right sneered the foreman run
with yore tale of grief to crawford tell
him i been pickin on you i hear youve
got to be quite a pet of his

  this brought dave up with a short turn
he could not take advantage of the service
he had done the owner of the d bar
lazy r to ask him to interfere in his behalf
with the foreman doble might be cyn-
ically defrauding him of part of what was
due him in wages dave would have to
fight that out with him for himself the
worst of it was that he had no redress
unless he appealed to the cattleman he
would have to accept what the foreman
offered

  moreover his pride was touched he
was young enough to be sensitive on the
subject of his ability to look out for him-
self

  im no pet of anybody he flung out
gimme that money it aint a square deal
but i reckon i can stand it

  i reckon youll have to its neck meat
or nothing grunted the foreman

  doble counted him out eighty dollars in
cattlemens checks and paid him the rest in
cash while dave signed a receipt the
hook-nosed foreman broad shoulders
thrown back and thumbs hitched in the
arm-holes of his vest sat at ease in a tilted
chair and grinned maliciously at his vic-
tim he was puttin something over on
him and he wanted dave to know it
dug had no affection for his half-brother
but he resented the fact that sanders pub-
licly and openly despised him as a crook
he took it as a personal reflection on him-
self

still smoldering with anger at this high-
handed proceeding dave went down
to the longhorn corral and saddled his
horse he had promised byington to help
water the herd

the blue

  this done he rode back to town hitched
the horse back of a barber-shop and went
in for a shave presently he was stretched
in a chair his boots thrown across the
foot-rest in front of him

  the barber lathered his face and mur-
mured gossip in his ear they say george
doble and miller claim theyre going to
denver to run some skin game at a street
fair theyre sure slick guys

  dave offered no comment

  you notice they didnt steal any of em
crawfords stock no sirree they knew
better hopped away with broncs be-
longing to you boys because they knew itd
be safe

  picked easy marks did they asked
the puncher sardonically

  the man with the razor tilted the chin
of his customer and began to scrape
well o course youre only boys they
took advantage of that and done you a
meanness

  dug doble came into the shop very
grim about the mouth he stopped to look
down sarcastically at the new boots san-
ders was wearing

  i see youve bought you a new pair of
boots he said in a domineering voice

  dave waited without answering his eyes
meeting steadily those of the foreman

  the big fellow laid a paper on the breast
of the cow-puncher heres a bill for a
pair of boots you charged to the old mans
account-eighteen dollars i got it just
now at the store youll dig up

  it was the custom for riders who came to
town to have the supplies they needed
charged to their employers against wages
due them doble took it for granted that
sanders had done this which was contrary
to the orders he had given his outfit he
did not know the young man had lost his
boots while rescuing crawford and had
been authorized by him to get another pair
in place of them

  nor did dave intend to tell him here
was a chance to even the score against the
foreman already he had a plan simmer-
ing in his mind that would take him out
of this part of the country for a time he
could no longer work for doble without
friction and he had business of his own
to attend to the way to solve the imme-
diate difficulty flashed through his brain in-
stantly every detail clear

  it was scarcely a moment before he
drawled an answer ill tend to it soon
as im out of the chair
book magazine

  i gave orders for none of you fellows
to charge goods to the old man said do-
ble harshly

  did you daves voice was light and
careless

  you can go hunt a job somewheres
else youre through with me

  ill hate to part with you

  dont get heavy young fellow

  no answered dave with mock meek-
ness

  doble sat down in a chair to wait he
had no intention of leaving until dave had
settled

a fter the barber had finished with
him the puncher stepped across to a
looking-glass and adjusted carefully the
silk handkerchief worn knotted loosely
round the throat

  get a move on you urged the fore-
man his patience of which he never had
a large supply to draw from was nearly
exhausted im not goin to spend all day
on this

  im ready

  dave followed doble out of the shop
apparently he did not hear the gentle re-
minder of the barber who was forced to
come to the door and repeat his question

  want that shave charged

  oh clean forgot sanders -turned
back feeling in his pocket for change

  he pushed past the barber into the shop
slapped a quarter down on the cigar-case
and ran out through the back door a
moment later he pulled the slip-knot of his
bridle from the hitching bar swung to the
saddle and spurred his horse to a gallop
in a cloud of dust he swept round the
building to the road and waved a hand de-
risively toward doble

  see you later he shouted

  the foreman wasted no breath in futile
rage he strode to the nearest hitching-
post and flung himself astride leather
the horses hoofs pounded down the road
in pursuit

  sanders was riding the same bronco he
had used to follow the horse-thieves it
had been under a saddle most of the time
for a week and was far from fresh before
he had gone a mile he knew that the fore-
man would catch up with him

  he was riding for gunsight pass it
was necessary to get there before doble
reached him otherwise he would have to
surrender or fight and neither of these
fitted in with his plans-

by william macleod raine

   once he had heard emerson crawford
 give a piece of advice to a hotheaded and
 unwise puncher never call for a gun-
 play on a bluff son theres no easier way
 to commit suicide than to pull a six-
 shooter you skint willing to use dug
  doble was what byington called bull-
 haided he had forced a situation which
 could not be met without a showdown
 this meant that the young range-rider
 would either have to take a thrashing or
 draw his forty-five and use it neither of
 these alternatives seemed worth while in
 view of the small stakes at issue because
 he was not ready to kill or be killed dave
 was flying for the hills

    the fugitive had to use his quirt to get
 there in time the steepness of the road
 made heavy going as he neared the sum-
 mit the grade grew worse the bronco
 labored heavily in its stride as its feet
 reached for the road ahead

   but here dave had the advantage do-
 ble was a much heavier man than he and
 his mount took the shoulder of the ridge
 more slowly by the time the foreman
  showed in silhouette against the skyline at
 the entrance to the pass the younger man
 had disappeared

   the d bar lazy r foreman found out
 at once what had become of him a crisp
 voice gave clear directions

   thatll be far enough stop right
 where youre at or youll notice trouble pop
 and dont reach for yore gun unless you
 want to hear the band begin to play a
 funeral piece

 the words came it seemed to doble
 out of the air he looked up two
 great boulders lay edge to edge beside the
 path through a narrow rift the blue nose
 of a forty-five protruded back of it glit-
 tered a pair of steady steely eyes

    the foreman did not at all like the look
 of things sanders was a good shot from
 where he lay almost entirely protected all
 he had to do was to pick his opponent off
 at his leisure if his hand were forced he
 would do it and the law would let him go
 scot free since doble was a fighting man
 and had been seen to start in pursuit of
 the boy

   come outa there and shell out that
 eighteen dollars demanded doble

   nothin doin dug 

   dont run on the rope with me young
 fellow youll sure be huntin trouble

    whats the use of beefing ive got the
gun-sight pass

dead wood on you better hit the dust
back to town and explain to the boys how
yore bronc went lame advised dave

  come down and ill wallop the tar outa
you

  much obliged im right comfortable
here

  ive a mind to come up and dig you
out

- please yoreself dug well find out
then which one of us goes to hell

  the foreman cursed fluently expertly
passionately not in a long time had he
had the turn called on him so adroitly he
promised dave sudden death in various
forms whenever he could lay hands upon
him

  youre sure doin yoreself proud dug
the young man told him evenly ill write
the boys how you spilled language so thor-
ough

 if i could only lay my hands on you
the rawboned cattleman stormed

  ill bet youd massacree me proper
admitted dave quite cheerfully

  suddenly doble gave up he wheeled
his horse and began to descend the steep
slope steadily he jogged on to town not
once turning to look back his soul was
filled with chagrin and fury at the defeat
this stripling had given him he was ready
to pick a quarrel with the first man who
asked him a question about what had taken
place at the pass

  nobody asked a question men looked
at him read the menace of his sullen angiy
face and sidestepped his rage they did
not need to be told that his ride had been
a failure his manner advertised it what-
ever had taken place had not redounded to
the glory of dug doble

i ater in the day the foreman met the
owner of the d bar lazy r brand to
make a detailed statement of the cost of
the drive he took peculiar pleasure in
mentioning one item 

  that young scalawag sanders beat you
outa eighteen dollars he said with a sneer

  doble had heard the story of what dave
and bob had done for crawford and of how
the wounded boy had been taken to the
cattlemans home and nursed there it
pleased him now to score off what he
chose to think was the soft-headedness of
his chief 

i the cattleman showed interest that
so dug sorry i took a fancy to that
boy what did be do

the blue



  you know how vaqueros are always
 cornin in and chargin goods against the
 boss i give out the word they was to
 quit it sanders he gets a pair of eighteen-
 dollar boots and jumps the town before i
 find out about it

   crawford started to speak but doble
 finished his story

   i took out after him but my bronc
 went lame from a stone in its hoof youll
 never see that eighteen plunks em it
 dont do to pet cow-hands

   too bad you took all that trouble
 dug the old cattleman began mildly
 the fact is-

   trouble say id ride to tombstone
 to get a crack at that young smart aleck
 i told him what id do to him if i ever
 got my fists on him

   so you did catch up with him

   dug drew back sulkily within himself
 he did not intend to tell all he knew about
 the gunsight pass episode i didnt say
 when i told him

   thas so you didnt well im right
 sorry you took so blamed much trouble to
 find him funny though he didnt tell
 you i gave him the boots

  you-what the foreman snapped
 the question out with angry incredulity

   the ranchman took the cigar from his
 mouth and leaned back easily he was
 smiling now frankly

   why yes i told him to buy the boots
 and have em charged to my account and
 the blamed little rooster never told you
 eh

   doble choked for words with which to
 express himself he glared at his employer
 as though crawford had actually insulted
 him

  in an easy conversational tone the cat-
 tleman continued but now there was a
 touch of frost in his eyes it was this-
 away dug when he and bob knocked
 steelmans plans hell west and crooked
 after that yellow skunk george doble be-
 trayed me to brad the boy lost his boots
 in the brush course i said to get an-
 other pair at the store and charge em to
 me i reckon he was having some fun
 joshin you

   the foreman was furious he sputtered
 i with the rage that boiled inside him but
 some instinct warned him that unless he
 wanted to break with crawford completely
 he must restrain his impulse to rip loose

   all right he mumbled if you told
 him to get em nough said

chapter x
the cattle-train

dave stood on the fence of one of the
shipping-pens at the albuquerque
stockyards and used a prod-pole to
guide the bawling cattle below the fifty-
four quarter circle was loading a train of
beef-steers and cows for denver just
how he was going to manage it dave did
not know but he intended to be aboard
that freight when it pulled out for the
mile-high town in colorado

  he had reached albuquerque by a
strange and devious route of zigzags and
back-trackings his weary bronco he had
long since sold for ten dollars at a cow-
town where he had sacked his saddle to be
held at a livery stable until sent for by
blind baggage he had ridden a night and
part qf a day for a hundred miles he
had actually paid his fare the next leg
of the journey had been more exciting he
elected to travel by freight for many
hours he and a husky brakeman had held
different opinions about this dave had
been chased from the rods into an empty
box-car and out of it to the roof he
had been ditched half a dozen times dur-
ing the night but each time he had man-
aged to hook on before the train had gath-
ered headway the brakeman enlisted the
rest of the crew in the hunt with the
result that the range-rider found himself
stranded on the desert ten miles from a
station he walked the ties in his high-
heeled boots and before he reached the
yards his feet were sending messages of
pain at every step reluctantly he bought
a ticket to albuquerque here he had
picked up a temporary job ten minutes
after his arrival

  a rawboned inspector kept tally at the
chute while the cattle passed up into the
car

  fifteen sixteen-prod em up you
arizona-seventeen eighteen-jab that
white-face along-nineteen-hustle em
in

  the air was heavy with the dust raised
by the milling cattle calves stretched
their necks and blatted for their mothers
which kept up in turn a steady bawling for
their strayed offspring they were con-
scious that something unusual was in
progress something that threatened their
security and comfort and they resented it
in the only way they knew

car after car was jammed full of the

frightened creatures as the men moved
from pen to pen threw open and shut the
big gates and hustled the stock up the
chutes dave had begun work at six in
the morning a glance at his watch
showed him that it was now ten oclock

 a middle-aged man in wrinkled cordu-
 roys and a pinched-in white hat drove up
 to the fence howre they coming
 sam he asked of the foreman in charge

 wed ought to be movin by noon mr
 west

 fine ive decided to send garrison in
 charge he can pick one of the boys to
 take along we cant right well spare any
 of em now if i knew where to find a
 good man-

 the lean arizona-born youth slid from
 a the fence on his prod-pole and stepped
 forward till he stood beside the buckboard
 of the cattleman

 im the man youre lookin for mr
 west

 the owner of the fifty-four-quarter-cir-
 cle brand looked him over with keen eyes
 around which nets of little wrinkles spread
 what man he asked

 the one to help mr garrison take the
 cattle to denver

 recommend yourself can you asked
 west with a hint of humor

 yes sir

who are you

 dave sanders-from arizona first off
 been punchin long

since i was a kid worked for the
d bar lazy r last

 ever go on a cattle-train

twice-to kansas city

hmp that grunt told dave just
what the difficulty was it said i
dont know you why should i trust you
to help take a trainload of my cattle
through

 you can wire to mr crawford at mal-
 api and ask him about me the young
 fellow suggested

 how long you ride for him

 three years cornin grass

how do i know youre the man you

 say you are

one of yore boys knows me-bud hol-
way

west grunted again he knew emerson
crawford well he was a level-headed
cow-man and his word was as good as his
bond if em said this young man was
trustworthy the shipper was willing to take
gun-sight pass 

a chance on him the honest eye the
open face the straightforward manner of
the youth recommended his ability and in-
tegrity the shipper was badly in need of
a man he made up his mind to wire

  let you know later he said and for
the moment dropped dave out of the con-
versation

  but before noon he sent for him

  ive heard from crawford he said and
mentioned terms

  whatevers fair agreed dave

  an hour later he was in the caboose of
a cattle-train rolling eastward he was
second in command of a shipment con-
signed to the denver terminal stockyards
company most of them were shipped by
the west cattle company an odd car
was a jackpot bunch of pick-ups composed
of various brands all the cars were packed
to the door as was the custom of those
days

  after the train had settled down to the
chant of the rails garrison sent dave on a
tour of the cars the young man reported
all well and returned to the caboose the
train-crew was playing poker for small
stakes garrison had joined them for a
time dave watched then read a four-day-
old newspaper through to the last advertise-
ment the hum of the wheels made him
drowsy he stretched out comfortably on
the seat with his coat for a pillow

yyhen dave awoke it was beginning to
 get dark garrison had left the
caboose evidently to have a look at the
stock dave ate some crackers and cheese
climbed on the roof and with a lantern
hanging on his arm moved forward

  already a few of the calves yielding to
the pressure in the heavily laden cars had
tried to escape it by lying down with
his prod dave drove back the nearest an-
imal then he used the nail in the pole
to twist the tails of the calves and force
them to their feet in those days of
crowded cars almost the most important
thing in transit was to keep the cattle on
their legs to prevent any from being tram-
pled and smothered to death

  as the night grew older both men were
busier with their lanterns and prod-poles
they went from car to car relieving the
pressure wherever it was greatest the
weaker animals began to give way worn
out by the heavy lurching and the jam of
heavy bodies against them they had to
be defended against their own weakness

the blue

  dave was crossing from the top of one
car to another when he heard his name
called he knew the voice belonged to
garrison and he listened to make sure
frem which car it came presently he
heard it a second time and localized the
sound as just below him he entered the
car by the end door near the roof

  hello call me he asked

  yep i done fell and bust my laig
can you get me outa here

   bad is it

  broken

  ill get some of the train-hands will
you be all right till i get back the
young man asked

  i reckon hop along right lively im
right in the jam here

  the conductor stopped the train with
the help of the crew dave got garrison
back to the caboose there was no doubt
that the leg was broken it was deckled
to put the injured man off at the next sta-
tion send him back by the up train and
wire west that dave would see the cattle
got through all right this was done

  dave got no more sleep that night he
had never been busier in his life before
morning broke half the calves were unable
to keep their feet the only thing to do
was to reload

  he went to the conductor and asked for
a siding the man running the train was
annoyed but did not say so he played
for time

  all right well come to one after a
while and ill put you on it he prom-
ised

ljalf an hour later the train rumbled

	merrily past a siding without stop-
ping dave walked back along the roof
to the caboose

   weve just passed a siding he told the
trainman

  couldnt stop there a freight behind
us has orders to take that to let the lim-
ited pass he said glibly

  dave suspected he was lying but he
could not prove it he asked where the
next siding was	

  a little ways down said a brakeman

  the puncher saw his left eyelid droop in
a wink to the conductor he knew now
that they were stalling for time the
end of their run lay only thirty miles away
they had no intention of losing two or
three hours time while the cattle were re-
loaded after the train reached the di-
book magazine



vision point another conductor and crew
would have to wrestle with the problem

  young sanders felt keenly his inexperi-
ence they were taking advantage of him
because he was a boy he did not know
what to do he had a right to insist on a
siding but it was not his business to de-
cide which one

  the train rolled past another siding and
into the yards of the division town at
once dave hurried to the station the
conductor about to take charge of the train
was talking with the one just leaving the
range-rider saw them look at him and laugh
as he approached his blood began to
warm

  i want you to run this train on to a
siding he said at once

  you the train-dispatcher asked the
new man satirically

  you know who i am ill say right
now that the cattle on this train are suf-
fering some wont last another hour im
goin to reload

  are you i guess not this trains
going out soon as weve changed engines
and thatll be in about seven minutes

  ill not go with it

  suit yourself said the officer jauntily
and turned away to talk with the other
man

  dave walked to the dispatchers office
the cow-puncher stated his case

  fix that up with the train conductor
said the dispatcher he can have a siding
whenever he wants it

  but he wont gimme one

  not my business

  whose business is it

  the dispatcher got busy over his charts
dave became aware that he was going to
get no satisfaction here

  he tramped back to the platform

  all aboard sang out the conductor

pave not knowing what else to do
swung on to the caboose as it passed

he sat down on the steps and put his brains
at work there must be a way out if he
could only find what it was the next sta-
tion was fifteen miles down the line be-
fore the train stopped there dave knew
exactly what he meant to do he wrote
out two messages one was to the di-
vision superintendent the other was to
hemy b west
he had swung from the steps of the
caboose and was in the station before the
conductor

by william macleod raine

   i want to send two telegrams he told
 the agent here they are all ready rush
 em through i want an answer here to the
 one to the division superintendent

   the wire to the railroad official read

   conductor freight number  refuses me
 siding to reload stock in my charge cattle
 down and dying serve notice herewith i
 put responsibffity for all loss on railroad
 will leave cars in charge of train-crew

                        dave sanders
         representing west cattle company

   the other message was just as direct

   conductor refuses me siding to reload
 cattle suffering and dying have wired di-
 vision superintendent will refuse respon-
 sibility and leave train unless siding given
 me

dave sanders

   the conductor caught the eye of the
 agent

   ill send the wires when i get time
 said the latter to the cowboy

   youll send em now-right now an-
 nounced dave

   say are you the president of the road
 bristled the agent

   youll lose yore job within fohty-eight
 hours if you dont send them telegrams
 now ill see to that personal dave
 leaned forward and looked at him steadily

   the conductor spoke to the agent nod-
 ding his head insolently toward dave
 young-man-heap-swelled-head he in-
 troduced him

   but the agent had had a scare it was
 his job at stake not the conductors he
 sat down sulkily and sent the messages

  the conductor read his orders and
 walked to fhe door

   number  leaving all aboard he
 called back insolently

   im staying here till i hear from the
 superintendent answered dave flatly
 you leave an youve got them cattle to
 look out for theyll be in yore care

   the conductor swaggered out and gave
 the signal to go the train drew out from
 the station and disappeared around a curve
 in the track five minutes later it backed
 in again the conductor was furious

   get aboard here you hayseed if youre
 going to ride with me he yelled

   dave was sitting the platform whit-
 tling a stick his back was comfortably
 resting against a truck apparently he had
 not heard

the conductor strode up to him and
gun-sight pass	the blue



looked down at the lank boy say are
you coming or aint you he shouted as
though he had been fifty yards away in-
stead of four feet	

  talkin to me dave looked up with
amiable surprise why no not if youre
in a hurry im waitin to hear from the
superintendent

  if you think any boob can come along
and hold up my train till i lose my right
of way youve got another guess coming
i aint going to be sidetracked by every
train on the division

  thats the companys business not
mine im interested only in my cattle
the conductor had quite a reputation
as a bully he had intended to override
this young fellow by weight of age au-
thority and personality that he had
failed filled him with rage

  say for half a cent id kick you into
the middle of next week he said between
clamped teeth

  the cowpunchers steel-blue eyes met his
steadily do you reckon that would be
quite safe he asked mildly

  that was a question the conductor had
been asking himself he did not know a
good many cowboys carried six-shooters
tucked away on their ample persons it
was very likely this one had not set out on
his long journey without one

  youre more obstinate than a missouri
mule the railroad man exploded i dont
have to put up with you and i wont
no 

  the agent came out from the station
waving two slips of paper heard from
the super he called

  one wire was addressed to dave the
other to the conductor dave read

  am instructing conductor to put you on
  siding and place train-crew under your or-
  ders to reload

  beneath was the signature of the super-
intendent

  the conductor flushed purple as he read
the orders sent by his superior

  well he stormed at dave what do
you want spit it out

  run me on the siding im gonna take
the calves out ofhe cars an tie em on
the feed-racks abovs

  howre you going to get them up
  elbow-grease

  if you think ill turn my crew into
freight-elevators because some fool cattle-
man didnt know how to load right-

  maybe youve got a kick cornin ill
not say you havent but this is an emer-
gency im willin to pay good money for
the time they help me dave made no
reference to the telegram in his hand he
was giving the conductor a chance to save
his face

  oh well thats different ill put it
up to the boys

  three hours later the wheels were once
more moving eastward dave had had the
calves roped down to the feed-racks above
the cars

chapter xi
the night clerk gets busy pronto

the stars were out long before daves
train drew into the suburbs of den-
ver it crawled interminably past
residence sections warehouses and small
manufactories coming to a halt at last in
a wilderness of tracks on the border of a
small narrow stream flowing sluggishly be-
tween wide banks cut out in the clay

  dave swung down from the caboose and
looked round in the dim light for the stock-
yards engine that was to pick up his cars
and run them to the unloading pens he
moved forward through the mud searching
the semi-darkness for the switch-engine it
was nowhere to be seen

  he returned to the caboose the con-
ductor and brakemen were just leaving

  my engines not here some one musta
slipped up on his job looks like where
are the stockyards sanders asked

  this conductor was a small middle-aged
man who made it his business to get along
with everybody he could he had dis-
tinctly refused to pick up his predecessors
quarrel with dave now he stopped and
scratched his head

  too bad cant you go up town and
phone out to the stockyards or if you
want to take a street-car out there youll
have time to hop one at stout street last
one goes about midnight

  in those days the telephone was not a
universal necessity dave had never used
one and did not know how to get his con-
nection he spent several minutes ringing
up shouting at the operator and trying to
understand what she told him he did not
shout at the girl because he was annoyed
his idea was that he would have to speak
loud to have his voice carry at last he
gave up hot and perspiring
book magazine	by william macleod ralne



   outside the drugstore he just had time to
 catch the last stockyards car his watch
 told him that it was two minutes past
 twelve

   he stepped forty-five minutes later into
 an office in which sat two men with their
 feet on a desk the one in his shirt-sleeves
 was a smug baldish young man with
 clothes cut in the latest mode he was
 rather heavy-set and looked flabby the
 other man appeared to be a visitor

   this the office of the denver terminal
 stockyards company asked dave

   theclerk looked the raw arizonan over
 from head to foot and back again the
 judgment that he passed was indicated by
 the tone of his voice

   names on the door aint it he asked
 superciliously

  you in charge here

   the clerk was amused or at least took
 the trouble to seem so you might think
 so mightnt you

  are you in charge asked dave
 evenly

  maybe so what you want

   i asked you if you was runnin this
 office

  hell yes whatre your eyes for
  the clerks visitor sniggered

   ive got a train of cattle on the edge of
 town explained dave the stockyards
 engine didnt show up

  consigned to us

  to the denver terminal stockyards
 company

  name of shipper

  west cattle company and henry b
 west 

   ah right ill take care of em the
 clerk turned back to his friend his man-
 ner dismissed the cow-punchei and she
 says to me id love to go with you mr
 edmonds you dance like an angel then
 i says-

   when interrupted dave calmly but
 those who knew him might have guessed
 his voice was a little too gentle

   i says youre some little kidder
 and-

  when

 the man who danced like an anggj
 turned halfway round and looked at
 the cowboy over his shoulder he was irri-
 tated

  when what he snapped

  when you goin to unload my stock
  in the morning 

   no sir youll have it done right now
 that stock has been moren two days with-
 out water

    im not responsible for that

    no but youll be responsible if the train
 aint onloaded now said dave

 it wont hurt em to wait till morning
 thats where youre wrong theyre
 sufferin all of em are alive now but
 they wont all be by moning if they dont
 get attention

    guess ill take a chance on that since
 you say its my responsibility replied the
 clerk impudently

   not none announced the man from
 arizona youll get busy pronto

   say is this my business or yours
   mine and yours both

   i guess i can run it if i need any
 help from you ill ask for it watch me
 worry about your old cows i have guys
 coming in here every day with hurry-up
 tales about how their cattle wont live until
 i get a wiggle on me i notice they all are
 able to take a little nourishment next day
 all right all right

   dave caught at the gate of the railing
 which was between him and the night
 clerk he could not find the combination
 to open it and therefore vaulted over he
 caught the clerk back of the neck by the
 collar and jounced him up and down hard
 in his chair

   youre asleep he explained i got
 to waken you up before you can sabe plain
 talk

   the clerk looked up out of a white
 frightened face say dont do that i
 got heart-trouble he said in a voice dry
 as a whisper

   what about that onloadin proposi-
 tion asked the arizonan

    ill see to it right away

   presently the clerk with a lantern in
 his hand was going across to the railroad-
 tracks in front of dave he had quite got
 over the idea that this lank youth was a
 safe person to make sport of

   they found the switch-crew in the en-
  gine of the cab playing seven up

   got a job for you train of cattle out
 at the junction the clerk said swinging
 up to the cab

   the men finished the hand and settled
 up but within a few minutes the engine
 was running out to the freight-trairi

   day was breaking before dave tumbled
 into bed he had left a call with the clerk
 to be wakened at noon	 
gun-sight pass

  after he had eaten breakfast at the
hotel he went out to have a look at his
stock he found that on the whole the
cattle had stood the trip well while he
was still inspecting them a voice boomed
at him a question

  well young fellow are you satisfied
with all the trouble youve made me

  he turned to see standing before him
the owner of the fifty-four-quarter-circle
brand the boys surprise fairly leaped
from his eyes

  didnt expect to see me here i reckon
the cattleman went on well i hopped a
train soon as i got yore first wire spill
yore story young man

  dave told his tale while the ranchman
listened in grim silence when sanders
had finished the owner of the stock
brought a heavy hand down on his shoulder
approvingly

  you can ship cattle for me long as
youve a mind to boy you fought for
that stock like it had been yore own
youll do to take along

  dave flushed with boyish pleasure he
had not known whether the cattleman
would approve what he had done and after
the long strain of the trip this endorsement
of his actions was more to him than food
or drink

  they say im kinda stubborn i didnt
aim to lie down and let those guys run
over me he said

 yore stubbornness is money m my
pocket do you want to go back and ride
for the fifty-four quarter circle

  maybe after a while mr west i got
business in denver for a few days

the cattleman smiled most of my
boys have when they hit town i notice
mine aint that kind i reckon its
some more stubbornness explained dave

  all right when youve finished that
business i can use you

  if dave could have looked into the fu-
ture he would have known that the days
would stretch into months and the months
to years before his face would turn toward
ranch-life again

chapter xii
the law puzzles dave

dave knew he was stubborn not
 many men would have come on such
 a wild-goose chase to denver in the
hope f getting back a favorite horse worth

the blue

so little in actual cash but he meant to
move to his end intelligently

  if miller and doble were in the city
they would be hanging out at some saloon
or gambling-house once or twice dave
dropped into chuck weavers place where
the sporting men from all over the conti-
nent inevitably drifted when in denver
but he had little expectation of finding the
men he wanted there these two rats of
the underworld would not attempt to fleece
keen-eyed professionals they would prey
on the unsophisticated

  his knowledge of their habits took him
to that part of town below lawrence
street while he chatted his foot on the
rail a glass of beer in front of him he
made inconspicuous inquiries of bartenders
it did not take him long to strike the trail

  two fellows i knew in the cattle coun-
try said they were cornin to denver won-
der if they did one of ems a big fat
guy name of miller-kinda rolls when he
walks others small and has a glass eye
called himself george doble when i knew
him

  come in here most every day-both of
em waitin for the festival of mountain
and plain to open up got some kinda
concession they look to yours truly
like-

  the bartender pulled himself up short
and began polishing the top of the bar vig-
orously he was a gossipy soul and more
than once his tongue had got him into
trouble

  you was sayin suggested the cow
boy

  that theyre good spenders as the fel-
low says amended the bartender to be
on the safe side

  when i usta know em they had a
mighty cute little trick pony-name was
chiquito seems to me ever hear em men-
tion it

  they was fussin about that horse to-
day seems they got an offer for him and
doble wants to sell miller he sayspno

  yes

  ill tell em a friend asked for em
what name

  yes do jim smith

  the fat old gobblers liable to drop in
any time now

  this seemed a good reason to mr jim
smith alias david sanders for dropping
out he did not care to have miller know
just yet who the kind friend was that had
inquired for him
book magazine

  but just as he was turning away a
word held him for a moment the discre-
tion of the man in the apron was not quite
proof against his habit of talk

  they been quarrelin a good deal to-
gether i expect the combination is about
ready to bust up he whispered confi-
dentially

  quarrelin what about

  oh i dunno they act like theyre
sore as a boil at each other honest i
thought they was goin to mix it yesterday
i breezed up wit a bottle an they kinda
cooled off

  doble drunk

  nope fact is theyd trimmed a gree-
ky boob and was rowin about the split
miller he claimed doble held out on him
ill bet he did too

tav did not care how much they quar-
 reled or how soon they parted after
he had got back his horse until that time
he preferred that they would give him only
one trail to follow instead of two

  the cow-puncher made it his business
to loaf on larimer street for the rest of
the day his beat was between fifteenth
and sixteenth streets usually on the other
side of the road from the klondike saloon

  about four oclock his patience was re-
warded miller came rolling along in a
sort of sailor fashion characteristic of him
dave had just time to dive into a pawn-
brokers shop unnoticed

  a black-haired black-eyed salesman
came forward to wait on him the puncher
cast an eye helplessly about him it fell
on a suit-case

  how much he asked

  seven dollars dirt sheap my frient

  got any telescope grips

  the salesman produced one dave
bought it because he did not know how to
escape without

  he carried it with him while he lounged
up and down the sidewalk waiting for
miller to come out of the klondike when
the fat gambler reappeared the tange-rider
fell in behind him unobserved and followed
up town past the tahor opera house as
far as california street here they swung
to the left as far as fourteenth where
miller disappeared into a rooming-house

  the amateur detective turned back to-
ward the business section on the way he
dropped guiltily the telescope into a de-
livery-wagon standing in front of a grocery
he had no use for it and he had already

by william macleod raine



come to feel it a white elephant on his
hands

  with the aid of a city directory dave
located the livery stables within walking
distance of the house where miller was
staying inspired perhaps by the nickel
detective stpries he had read the cowboy
bought a pair of blue goggles and a store
collar in this last substituted for the
handkerchief he usually wore loosely round
his throat the sleuth nearly strangled him-
self for lack of air his inquiries at such
stables as he found brought no satisfac-
tion neither miller nor the pinto had
been seen at any of them

  later in the evening he met hemy b
west at the st james hotel

  hows that business of yores gettin
along boy asked the cattleman with a
smile

  dont know yet say mr west if i
find a hawss thats been stole from me how
can i get it back

  some one steal a hawss from you
dave told his story west listened to a
finish

  i know a lawyer here well ask him
what to do the ranchman said

  they found the lawyer at the athletic
club west stated the case

  your remedy is to replevin if they
fight youll have to bring witnesses to
prove ownership

  bring witnesses from malapi why i
cant do that said dave staggered i
aint got the money why cant i just take
the hawss its mine

  the law doesnt know its yours

  dave left much depressed of course
the thieves would go to a lawyer and of
course he would tell them to fight the
law was a darned queer thing it made
the recovery of his property so costly that
the crooks who stole it would laugh at him

  looks like the laws made to protect
scalawags instead of honest folks dave
told west

  i dont reckon it is but it acts that
way sometimes admitted the cattleman
you can see yoreself it wouldnt do for
the law to say a fellow could get property
from another man by just sayin it was
his sorry sanders after all a broncs
only a bronc ill give you yore pick of
two hundred if you come back with me to
the ranch

  much obliged seh maybe i will
later

  the cowpuncher walked up the streets
gun-sight pass

while he thought it over he had no in-
tention whatever of giving up chiquito if
he could find the horse so far as the law
went he was in a blind alley he was
tied hand and foot that possession was
nine points before the courts he had heard
before

  the way to recover flashed to his brain
like a wave of light he must get posses-
sion all he had to do was to steal his own
horse and make for the hills if the thieves
found him later-and the chances were
that they would not even attempt pursuit
if he let them know who he was-he
would force them to the expense of going
to law for chiquito what was sauce for
the goose must be for the gander too

  daves tramp had carried him across
the platte into north denver on his way
back he passed a corral close to the rail-
road tracks he turned in to look over
the horses

  the first one his eyes fell on was chi-
quito

chapter xiii
for murder

dave whistled the pony pricked up
its ears looked around and came
straight to him the young man
laid his face against the soft silky nose
fondled it whispered endearments to his
pet he put the bronco through its tricks
for the benefit of the corral attendant

  well ill be doggoned that youth
commented the little pinto sure is a
wonder acts like he knows you mighty
well

  ought to i trained him had him
before miller got him

  bet you hated to sell him

  you know it dave moved forward to
his end the intention to get possession of
the horse he spoke in a voice easy and
casual saw miller awhile ago theyre
talkin about sellin the paint hawss him
and his partner doble im to saddle up
and show what chiquito can do

  say thats a good notion if i was a
buyer id pay ten bucks more after youd
put him through that circus stuff

  which is millers saddle when it
was pointed out to him dave examined it
and pretended to disapprove too heavy
lend me a lighter one cant you

  sure heres three or four help your-
self

the blue



  the wrangler moved into the stable to
attend to his work

  dave cinched swung to the saddle and
rode to the gate of the corral two men
were coming in and by the sound of their
voices were quarreling they stepped aside
to let him pass one on each side of the
gate so that it was necessary to ride be-
tween them

  they recognized the pinto at the same
moment dave did them on the heels of
that recognition came another

  doble ripped out an oath and a shout of
warning its sanders

  a gun flashed as the pony jumped to a
gallop the silent night grew noisy with
shots voices the clatter of hoofs twice
dave fired answers to the challenges which
leaped out of the darkness at him he
raced across the bridge spanning the platte
and for a moment drew up on the other
side to listen for sounds which might tell
him whether he would be pursued one
last solitary revolver-shot disturbed the
stillness

  the rider grinned think hed know
better than to shoot at me this far

  he broke his revolver extracted the
empty shells and dropped them to the
street then he rode up the long hill to-
ward highlands passed through that sub-
urb of the city and went along the dark
and dusty road to the shadows of the
rockies silhouetted in the night sky

  his flight had no definite objective ex-
cept to put as much distance between him-
self and denver as possible he knew
nothing about the geography of colorado
except that a large part of the rocky
mountains and a delectable city called
denver were there his train trip to it
had told him that one of its neighbors was
new mexico which was in turn adjacent
to arizona therefore he meant to get to
new mexico as quickly as chiquito could
quite comfortably travel

  unfortunately dave was going west in-
stead of south every step of the pony
was carrying him nearer the roof of the
continent nearer the passes of the front
range which lead by divers valleys and
higher mountains beyond to the snow-clad
regions of eternal white

  up in this altitude it was too cold to
camp out without a fire and blankets

  i reckon well keep goin old pal the
young man told his horse ive noticed
roads mostly lead somewheres

  day broke over valleys of swirling mist
book magazine

far below the rider the sun rose and
dried the moisture dave looked down on
a town scattered up and down a gukh

  he met an ore-team and asked the driver
what town it was the man looked curi-
ously at him

 why its idaho springs he said
where you come from

  dave eased himself in the saddle from
the southwest

 youre quite a ways from home i
reckon your hills aint so uncurried down
there are they

  the cow-puncher looked over the moun-
tains he was among the summits aglow
in the amber light of day with the many
blended colors of wild flowers we got
some down there too that dont fit a ladys
boodwar say if i keep movin wherell
this road take me

  the man with the ore-team gave infor-
mation it struck dave that he had run
into a blind alley

  if youre after a job i reckon you can
find one at some of the mines theyre
needin hands the teamster added

 perhaps this was the best immediate
solution of the problem the puncher
nodded farewell and rode down into the
town

  he left chiquito at a livery bam after
having personally fed and watered the
pinto and went to a hotel here he reg-
istered not under his own name ate break-
fast and lay down for a few hours sleep
when he awakened he wrote a note with
the stub of a pencil to bob hart it read

   well bob i done got chiquito back
  though it sure looked like i wasnt going
  to but you never can teb and as old buck
  byington says its a hell of a long road with-
  out no bend in it and which you can bet
  your boots the old alkali is right at that
  well i found the little pie-eater in denver

  	k but so gaunt he wont hardly throw a
  shadow and what can you expect of scala-
  wags like miller and doble who dont know
  bow to treat a horse w i run chiquito
  off right under their noses and we had a
  little gun play and made my getaway and

  	reckon i will stay a spell and work here
  well good luck to all the boys till i see
  them again in the sweet by and by

dave

   p s get this money order cashed old-
  timer and pay the boys what i borrowed
  when we hit the trail after miller and doble

  i lit out too sudden to settle five to steve
  and five to buck well so long

dave

  the puncher went to the post office got
a money order and mailed the letter then

by william macleodl raine

he returned to the hotel he intended to
eat dinner and then look for work

  three or four men were standing on the
steps of the hotel talking with the pro-
prietor dave was quite close before the
boniface saw him

  thats him the hotel-keeper said in
an excited whisper

  a brown-faced man without a coat
turned quickly and looked at sanders he
wore a belt with cartridges and a re-
volver

whats your name he demanded
dave knew at once this man was an of-
ficer of the law he knew too the fu-
tility of trying to escape under the pseudo-
nym he had written on the register
sanders-dave sanders

  i want you

  so who are you

  sheriff of the county

  what you want me for

  murder

  dave gasped his heart beat fast with
a prescience of impending disaster mur-
der he repeated dully

  youre charged with the murder of
george doble last night in denver

  the boy stared at him with horror-
stricken eyes doble my god did i
kill him he clutched at a porch-post
to steady himself the hills were sliding
queerly up into the sky

chapter xiv
ten years

all the way back to denver while
the train ran down through the
narrow crooked canon daves mind
dwelt in a penumbra of horror if was
impossible he could have killed doble he
kept telling himself he had fired back
into the night without aim he had not
even tried to hit the men who were shoot-
ing at him it must be some ghastly joke

  none the less he knew by the dull ache
in his heart that this awful thing had
fastened on him and that he would have to
pay the penalty he had killed a man
snuffed out his life wantonly as a result of
taking the law into his own hands the
knowledge of it shook him to the soul

  it remained with him in the background
of his mind up to and through his trial
what shook his nerve was the fact that he
had taken a life not a certainty of the
punishment that must follow
 gun-sight pass



  west called to see him at the jail and
to the cattleman dave told the story ex-
actly as it had happened the owner of
the fifty-four quarter circle walked up
and down the cell rumpling his hair

  boy why didnt you let on to me what
you was figurin on pullin off i knew
you was some bull-headed but i thought
you had a lick o sense left

  wisht i had said dave miserably
well whats dones done no use cry-
in over the bust-up wed better fix up
whatevers left from the smash first off
well get a lawyer i reckon

  i gotta lit money left-twenty-six dol-
lars spoke up dave timidly maybe
thats all hell want

  west smiled at this babe-in-the-woods
itll last as long as a snowball in you-
know-where if hes like some lawyers ive
met up with

  it did not take the lawyer whom west
engaged long to decide on the line the de-
fense must take well show that miller
and doble were crooks and that they had
wronged sanders that will count a lot
with a jury he told west well admit
the killing and claim self-defense

tthe day before the trial dave was sit-
ting in his cell cheerlessly reading a
newspaper when visitors were announced

at sight of emerson crawford and bob
hart he choked in his throat tears
brimmed in his eyes nobody could have
been kinder to him than west had been
but these were home folks he had known
them many years their kindness in com-
ing melted his heart

  he gripped their hands but found him-
self unable to say anything in answer to
their greetings he was afraid to trust his
voice and he was ashamed of his emotion

  the boys are for you strong dave
we all figure you done right steve he
says he wouldnt worry none if youd got
miller too bob breezed on

  thats no way to talk son reproved
crawford its bad enough right as it is
without you boys wantin it any worse
but dont you get down-hearted dave
were allowin to stand by you to a finish

it aint as if youd got a good man doble
was a mean-hearted scoundrel if ever i met
up with one hes no loss to society were
going to show the jury that too

  they did

  but dave was unable to prove self-de-
fense miller stuck doggedly to his story

the blue

the cowpuncher had fired the first shot
he had continued to fire though he must
have seen doble sink to the ground im-
mediately moreover the testimony of the
doctor showed that the fatal shot had
taken effect at close range

  the jury found him guilty of murder
in the second degree the judge sentenced
him to ten years in the penitentiary

  when bob hart came to say good-by be-
fore dave was removed to canon city the
young range-rider almost broke down he
was greatly distressed at the misfortune
that had befallen his friend

  were gonna stay with this dave you
know crawford he goes through when
he starts soon as theres a chance well
hit the governor for a pardon its a damn
shame old pal thats what it is

  dave nodded a lumpin his throat in-
terfered with speech

  the op man lent me money to buy
chiquito and im gonna keep the pinto
till you get out thatll help pay yore
lawyer continued bob one thing
more youre not the only one thats
liable to be sent up millers on the way
back to anzona if he dont get a term
for hawss-stealing im a liar

  the guard who was to take dave to the
penitentiary bustled in cheerfully all
right boys if youre ready well be
movin down to the depot

  the friends shook hands again

chapter xv
in denver

the warden handed dave a ticket
back to denver and with it a stereo-
typed little lecture of platitudes
your future lies before you to be made
or marred by yourself sanders you owe
it to the governor who granted this parole
and to the good friends who have worked
so hard for it that you be honest and in-
dustrious and temperate if you do this
the world will in time forget your past mis-
takes and give you the right hand of fel-
lowship as i do now

  the paroled man took the fat hand but
the hard cynical eyes made the warden
uncomfortable once or twice before he
had known prisoners like this quiet silept
men who were never insolent but whose
eyes told of iron-seared souls

  well wish you luck

  thanks
book magazine

  the convict turned away grave un-
smiling

  the prison officers eyes followed him a
little wistfully he had been unable to in-
fluence him as he had others

  sanders walked slowly out of the office
and through the door in the wall that led
back to life he was free tomorrow was
his all the tomorrows of all the years of
his life were waiting for him but the fact
stirred in him no emotion as he stood in
the dry colorado sunshine his heart was
quite dead

  in the earlier days of his imprisonment
it had not been so he had dreamed often
of this hour at night in the darkness of
his cell imagination had projected picture
after picture of it vivid colorful set to
music but his parole had come too late
the years had taken their toll of him the
shadow of the prison had left its chill
had done something to him that had made
him a different david sanders from the
boy who had entered he wondered if he
would ever learn to laugh again if he would
ever run to meet life eagerly as that other
david sanders had a thousand years ago

lie followed the road down to the little
  station and took a train to denver
it was his intention to go back to malapi
to the country he knew and loved but he
wished to pick up a job in the city for a
month or two until he had settled into a
frame of mind in which liberty had become
a habit

  early next morning he began his search
for work it carried him to a lumber-yard
adjoining the railroad yards

  we need a night watchman the su-
perintendent said whered you work
last

  at canon city

  the lumberman looked at him quickly
a question in his glance

  yes dave went on doggedly in the
penitentiary

  a moments embarrassment ensued
  what were you in for

  killing a man

  too bad im afraid-

  he had stolen my horse and i was try-
ing to get it back i had no intention of
hitting him when i fired

  id take you in a minute so far as im
concerned personally but our board of
directors-afraid they wouldnt like it
thats one trouble in working for a corpo-
ration

by william macleod raine

  sanders turned away the superin-
tendent hesitated then called after him

  if youre up against it and need a dol-
lar-

  thanks i dont im looking for
work not charity the applicant said
stiffly

  wherever he went it was the same as
soon as he mentioned the prison doors
of opportunity closed to him nobody
wanted to employ a man tarred with tht
pitch it did not matter why he had gone
under what provocation he had erred the
thing that had damned him was that he
had been there it was a taint a corro-
sion he could have picked up a job easily
enough if he had been telling a lie about his
past but he had made up his mind to tell
the truth in the long run he could not
conceal it better start with the slate
clean

  when he got a job it was to unload cars
of fruit for a commission house a man
wanted in a hurry and the employer did
not ask any questions at the end of an
hour he was satisfied

  fellow hustles peaches like hed been
at it all his life the commission man told
his partner

  a few days later came the question that
sanders had been expecting whered
you work before you came to us

  at the penitentiary

  a guard asked the merchant taken
aback

  no i was a convict the big lithe man
in overalls spoke quietly his eyes meeting
those of the market street man with un-
wavering steadiness

  what was the trouble

  dave explained the merchant made no
comment but when he paid off the men
saturday night he said with careful cas-
ualness sorry sanders the work will
be slack next week ill have to lay you
off

  the man from canon city understood
he looked for another place was rebuffed
a dozen times and at last was given work
by an employer who had vision enough to
know the truth that the bad men do not
all go to prison and that some who go may
be better than those who do not

in this place sanders lasted three weeks

  he was doing concrete work on a via-
duct job for a contractor employed by the
city

  this time it was a fellow-workman who
gun-sight pass

learned of the arizonans record a letter
from emerson crawford forwarded by the
warden of the penitentiay dropped out of
daves coat pocket where it hung across
a plank

  the man who picked it up was a gossip
and he read the letter before returning it
to the pocket he began at once to whis-
per the news the subject wa discussed
back and forth among the men on the
quiet sanders guessed they had discov-
ered who he was but he waited for them
to move his years in prison had given
him at least the strength of patience he
could bide his time

  they went to the contractor he rea-
soned with them

  does his work all right doesnt he
treat you all civilly doesnt force hisself
on you i dont see any harm in him
we aint workin with no jailbird an-
nounced the spokesman

  he told me the story and ive looked
it up since talked with the lawyer that
defended him he says the man sanders
killed vas a bad lot and had stolen his
horse from him sanders was trying to
get it back he claimed self-defense but
couldnt prove it

  dont make no difference the jury
said he was guilty didnt it

  suppose he was weve got to give
him a chance when he comes out havent
we

  some of the men began to weaken they
were not cruel but they were children of
impulse easily led by those who had force
enough to push to the front

  i wont mix with no convict the self-
appointed leader announced flatly that
goes

  the contractor met him eye to eye
you dont have to reynolds you can
get your time

  meanin that you keep him on the job
and let me go

  thats it exactly long as he does his
work well ill not ask him to quit

  a shadow darkened the doorway of the
temporary officce the arizonan stepped
in with his easy swinging stride

  im leaving today mr shields his
voice carried the quiet power of reserve
force

by william macleod raine



  not because i want you to sanders
because im not going to stay and make
you trouble

  i dont think it will come to that im
talking it over with the boys now your
work stands up ive no criticism

  ill not stay now mr shields since
theyve complained to you id better go

the ex-convict looked around the eyes
in his sardonic face hard and bitter
if he could have read the thoughts of the
men it would have been different most
of them were ashamed of their protest
they would have liked to have drawn back
but they did not know how to say so
therefore they stood awkwardly silent
afterward when it was too late they
talked it over and blamed each other

  from one job to another dave drifted
his stubborn pride due in part to a native
honesty that would not let him live under
false pretenses in part to a bitterness that
had become dogged defiance kept him out
of good places and forced him to do heavy
unskilled labor for the poorest pay

  yet he saved money bought himself
good cheap clothes and found energy to
attend night school where he studied sta-
tionary and mechanical engineering

  the library he patronized a good deal
but he gave no time to general literature
his reading was of a highly specialized
nature he studied everything that he
could find about the oil-fields of america

from whom he rented his room the quiet
upstanding man who never complained or
asked any favors had been a favorite of
hers but she was a timid conventional
soul visions of her roomers departing in
a flock when they found out about the man
in the second floor back began to haunt her
dreams perhaps he might rob them all
at night in a moment of nerve tension
summoning all her courage she asked the
killer from arizona if he would leave

  he smiled grimly and began to pack

 aymesiille

a

barren umiller

they work in a volcano these steel-mill huskies

 heres a flame-vivid story of what happened
there one critical night

jim burbridge glared back at the
super who sat solidly at the broad
polished oak desk of the central mill
office and searched his soul for ap-
propriate words

  all right  he raged there were choice
mill epithets he would rather have used
im through i cant he here both day and
night if john royce didnt finish the
limestone platform i may be responsible
for it but i cant sit up and make him do
it i guess ill quit

  i wish you would snorted the super
sardonically staring with ruthless indiffer-
ence at jim he didnt mean it jim knew
but one of the supers fetishes was that no
man was essential to the mill

  you know mr leavenworth that the
night shifts the trouble shift around these
diggins-thats why i always take it my-
self retorted jim and im sure royce
does the best he can with the day-shift
gang-otherwise id fire him danged sud-
den as for that broken wobbler the rea-
son i let the gang put it in instead of going
at it myself and maybe saving a few min-
utes of time is- he hesitated a moment
well super its a private one that id
rather not try to explain if you dont mind

  all right-forget it grunted the super
incuriously but get that platform done



tonight burbridge dayton tells me weve
got a hang forming up in number  blast
furnace and itll give way on us if we dont
get in more limestone flux its up to you

  he turned fidgeting with his papers and
jim went out of the office feeling some-
how as if he had been spanked all steel
men are husks and when one husk belabors
another the process is cruel to mind and
body every man in jaynesville rolling
mills was a husk a physical heavyweight
your nervous wiry type had no place in
that mill sons of anak were they all
with tempers as violent and wills as force-
ful as those of big men the world over
there had not been a single suggestion of
leniency of sympathy in the supers
tones he liked jim in his rough domi-
neering way and jim liked him with the
sort of liking that causes one he-man to
punch and pound the fellow-husk that he
loves all the bruisers in the mill loved
each other that way but if they showed it
at all it was sure to be in scornful and op-
probrious epithet returnable in sarcasm
quite as biting

  as for jims reason for not tackling the
wobbler he always kept that a carefully
guarded secret to be specific in spite of
his immense frame and athletes sinews
jims heart often bothered him-a relic of
the night shift at jaynesville

a kid case of typhoid fever on excis-
ing occasions it invariably jumped and
thumped and cut up in a way that caused
faint spells to sweep over him instinc-
tively therefore he usually held back and
let his men go at the job unless it was
essential that he take the lead himself

ljalf of our troubles in life exist solely
  in vain imaginings and as jim
trudged across the windy black areas of
the mill yard he was suffering acutely from
that mind-made disease he imagined that
the super was down on him and as he
passed the various foremen and chiefs of
departments on their way to the night
shift he imagined that they nodded to him
indifferently without the usual taunting
gibe or sardonic jest their greetings
seemed to him lacking in some quality of
cheer he felt that they were distant to-
ward him and disliked him though it was
all due most probably to the execrable
weather which kept every mans thoughts
preoccupied

  but even though he labored under the
delusion that the whole works did not give
a whoop for him he had no intention of
quitting to him the romance the con-
quering heroic thrill of the great steel-mill
tingled to the very roots of his soul he
loved the vast cyclopean stage on which
his work was cast always a gorgeous spec-
tacle with its play of converter glare
against the inky buildings its blue flames
curling from the iron chimney tops its
giant muffled thunderings of steam ham-
mer rail-roll and blast blower the jaynes-
ville steel-mill as he crossed its yard
seemed like a fortress of industry-a giants
castle even more lurid than when it
squatted shimmering in the sun its bastions
glimmered on the black screen of night
with the illumination of the white-hot steel
its chimneys belched black smoke and blue
gas-flames against the starlit sky lit up
with the glow of huge caldrons of con-
verter steel the mill stood pricked out in
vast squares and shafts of light while far
overhead the rolling billows of black smoke
tumbled from tall chimney-tops tinted
with orange edgings of light reflected from
the converters

  force force without stint was here
the thumping grunt of the main-roll en-
gines bulldozing steel ingots through the
rails the puffings of yard locomotives haul-
ing long trains of iron ingot molds the
muffled thud of great blast-furnace blowers

the blue



driven by walking-beam engines four
stories high the sharp scream of the rail
saws the continuous clang of rails
tumbling into iron gondola cars-the noise
and tumult of industrial battle the battle
for the worlds advancement that is never
done tens of thousands of horsepower
shook the ground underfoot force beyond
the comprehension of man welded the
tough steel into the rails needed to span
the spaces of the earth

a s jim entered his office shack messen-
 ger-boys on bicycles flocked to him
bearing yellow trouble slips there was
always trouble more or less somewhere
within the five square miles of the mill
yard and burbridge was chief of repairs
his first slip told of a broken valve-stem
blower-engine number  blower-house
his repair-gang scattered under barked
orders to storeroom and machine-shop
while burbridge ran for the blower-house
picking his way over the mesh of tracks
by the glare from converter flame and mill
window entering its iron door the ac-
customed smell of clean oil and live steam
greeted his nostrils up in the dim vault
of the blower-house towered the tall a-
frame of the engine its silent walking-
beam a mute protest against this stoppage
of the mills life a knot of machinists
were already at work unbolting the offend-
ing valve-bonnet and presently his own
men charged in lugging a brightly polished
new valve half an hours work sufficed
to plop it onto the seat of the broken one
and replace the bonnet then with a
groan and a whistle of steam the big
blower-engine began to move its long con-
necting rod descending inexorably swing-
ing the crank into the depths of the pit
rotating the forty-foot flywheel and set-
ting up a cough and rattle of air-pressure
in the blower cylinders-that the blast
furnaces might have vital oxygen again to
carry on the long process of turning mich-
igan ore into finished rails

  a bicycle boy slammed the blower-house
door and came running up to burbridge
with a yellow slip urgent it read
rail snarl in the number  rail-rolls
hurry

  calling his men jim set off at a run a
quarter of a mile away the lurid light from
the roll-mill windows foretold fierce swift
action ahead and they covered the space
on the double grabbing crowbars off the
racks as they entered the mill a weird
book magazine

battle was going on under the red murk
that hung over the rail-table men every
second in danger of their lives were fight-
ing a writhing twisting mass of red-hot
rails that towered and squirmed over and
about them giants were they men who
did not know how to flinch who jabbed
and pried with ready bars dodging and
jumping among the fiery serpents parting
them straightening them driving them
apart

  one red ribbon of steei running off side-
wise out of the rolls had started it all it
had welded to its neighbor like putty and
the two had risen and curved like fighting
snakes toppling over their peacefully run-
ning neighbors and starting a riot among
the coiling red-hot plastic rail shapes

  as burbridge came in the rolls had al-
ready been reversed and the unruly mon-
sters were being run out of the fray by the
same rolls that had just shot them out on
the table burbridges gang ran out on
the iron rail-table and fought a rear-guard
engagement prying and separating the
twisting tails of the snarl he drove his
bar into a mess of three of them welded
together by the shock of their impact and
hopping over the blazing steel his men
seconded him like well-drilled soldiers it
was fast and furious work for such a rail
allowed to grow cold is worse than no rail
at all

  in a few moments the table was clear
and the fresh heads of the rails straight-
ened by their passage backward through
the rolls came shooting out along their ac-
customed grooves burbridge breathed
raucously dizzy with the heat and exertion

  who started this he demanded of the
foreman of the rolls

  podrazza-the hunk yonder-hes yel-
low got cold feet ran when the rail
started to go

  fetch him here ordered burbridge
podrazza you no dobre no good-see
he glared angrily at the panic-stricken
hungarian

  you go catchem timeslip-pay-office
youre fired-get me he shouted waving
him away it takes the irish or a west
virginian mountaineer to run that job
he added to the foreman dont put any
more foreigners on there he indicated
the long line of men that stood on guard
on the rail-table

  ill lend you one of my men until you
can rout out one from the day shifts

lie turned over his trouble slips and dis-
 patched men to attend to the various
minor breakdowns a slip requiring his
immediate presence at the number two
converter caught his eye and remembering
the supers injunction he started out across
the black wind-swept areas of the mill
yard to where a tall slanting shaft of light
told of a converter at work blowing blast-
furnace iron into steel he found dayton
the converter foreman up on the operating
platform

  mr burbridge i want you to watch
this next pour dayton greeted him its
running too acid and the quicker we get
that extension to the platform finished
and working up on top of this blast-fur-
nace the better our checkers are going
to begin rejecting rails if we dont-and
the furnace has been needing re-lining for
some time as it is

  he pulled the hydraulic control levers as
he spoke and the converter made a giant
dip its flaming sword of gases shot
through with scintillating sparks swept
down in a great arc bathing the iron walls
of the room with laving flames dayton
pulled another lever and a huge caldron
swung over until it hung under the snout
of the converter below a puffing loco-
motive had drawn a train of ingot-molds
under the caldron to receive the steel from
its spigot

  a living stream of blinding white-hot
liquid iron poured from the converter into
the caldron gradually filling it as the two
men watched finally the hissing waves
of white and violet rose to the top and the
watchers put on blue glasses to protect
their eyes then dayton pulled another
lever and a shower of manganese ore
tumbled out of a chute and plopped into
the fiery bath tongues of purple violet
blue and orange arose from the surface as
the reaction took place

  dayton shook his head too acid mr
burbridge-as you can see for yourself
we cant add any more manganese and
still keep to the specifications youll have
to finish that platform and get more lime-
stone coming tonight or wesre in for a
lot of rejected rails and therell be the
devil to pay the construction gang quit
at five-cant your men finish that plat-
form for us

  i reckon its up to us admitted bur-
bridge ill get the mob here lets see
your furnace pour

  dayton swung the converter until its
the night shift at jaynesville

glowing nozzle rested under the nose of a
long cast-iron trough coming out from the
vast iron side of the blast-furnace tucked
in under a ring of columnar steel struts that
braced the huge cone of the furnace bot-
tom a group of giants armed with long
iron bars prodded at a white knothole of
lute clay presently a white-hot glare shot
out showers of scintillating sparks flew
forth in a stream like dazzling fire-flies
falling harmlessly on the naked shoulders
of the furnace-men and then a fast rivulet
of liquid iron darted down the trough to be
swallowed by the greedy maw of the con-
verter the river of molten iron did not
pour steadily it spurted in jerky blobs
while ominous rumblings came from inside
the blast-furnace

  gee its skeery working here-short
as we are on limestone flux complained
dayton nervously

  how so inquired burbridge the
supers worried for fear well get a hang-
think hes right

  were liable to start the hang any
minute croaked dayton and then-
good night ive got kids too

durbridge went white in spite of him-
self he had lived through one hang
-and did not want to see another it oc-
curs when the spongy porous mass of half-
molten ore lacking flux forms a great arch
inside the blast-furnace as the liquid
metal below is tapped off and no more
melt comes down it leaves a deep void
below and when the arch finally crumbles
and falls hundreds of tons of ore drop
down into the cone of the furnace and an
explosion greater than that of a hundred
boilers takes place at the last one to oc-
cur in the works the whole bottom of the
blast-furnace was blown open rivers of
white-hot iron squirted forth in every di-
rection with the speed of a lava eruption
men were incinerated in their tracks steel
columns and struts were melted off their
bases and a works locomotive caught in
the stream of fire blew up like a toy bal-
loon over a gas-jet it had been a night
of terror-and burbridge had been in the
thick of it

  that metal pours as if we were gettin
one now went on dayton uneasily -for
gods sake mr burbridge be nice with
your steel up there and dont drop no
i-beams down rough-like on the plat-
form if weve got a hang forming up in
there any little jarll likely start it going

the blue



  ill get that limestone platform -fin-
ished up at once said burbridge de-
cisively he went out into the windy
night and captured a few bicycle boys
sending them scouring the mill to round up
his gang then he hurried around the
blast-furnace under the ring of cone struts
and was shot up in its ore elevator to the
platform on top

  takes a husk to hit up this pace he
grinned nothing like a steel-mill for a
he-mans job a hang he shrugged
his shoulders with conviction only had
one in my time-thank god he added

  the enlargement of the blast-furnace
platform was being done by carrying out
a corner of it over the furnace nozzle op-
posite daytons operating platform more
than a hundred feet below when bur-
bridge stepped out to size up the job the
wind was shrieking roaring and rattling
through the chains and rods of the filling-
cone crane gear on the furnace top the
continuous rumble of ore-cars dumping
their loads into th cone the rattle of the
gears as they lowered it and the ore dis-
appeared into the furnace to the accom-
paniment of bursts of blue flames the
whine and whistle of the wind and the
fumes of gases rising from the hot caldron
and ingot-molds below-these made a lurid
setting for the task to be done

  a pile of structural steel lay on the
platform and one glance at the job told
burbridge why the day gang had quit
promptly at five two channel-irons had
already been run out to form one corner
of the extensions but their outer ends had
not been bolted up instead they rattled
and shook in the wind clashing against
each other with every gust some one
would have to crawl out there and join
them up and the day gang had had one big
think about it and just decided to quit
no one caring to risk it

  when burbridges gang came up with
the next load of ore they eyed the job-
respectfully most of them burbridge
knew were thinking of their families and
how far their tiny lodge insurances would
carry them in case of accident who would
look after the wife and kids if a man
should be blown off that channel-iron into
the white-hot converter-flames below

  burbridge looked at the quivering steel
he was their leader typhoid heart or no
it was up to him

  norton come here he called to one
of his most trusted men
book magazine

  cant do it sir broke in norton ear-
nestly im married and got two kids-

  cut it interrupted burbridge im
going out there myself-dont worry its
all right all i want you to do is to get
out on yonder railing and hand me a pry-
bar when i get to the end of the channel
ta-ta boys-theres nothing to it any-
how

i icking dry lips burbridge set foot on
the channel-iron it shivered and shook
under him and he got down astride of it
fear began to descend upon him like a pall
the channel swayed under him death
seemed to lurk in the deep void below the
devilish wind never seemed to cease clutch-
ing and tearing at him with invisible fin-
gers stifling fumes of gases choked the
breath in his lungs

  burbridge stopped to quiet his pounding
heart and looked about the big brass
chimes of the alarm-whistle on the round
iron wall of the furnace grinned at him
sardonically not twenty feet away it was
used to give the alarm in case of a threat-
ening hang its pull-rope led down in the
dark distances to daytons platform far
below burbridge gazed at it fascinated
as he reflected what it was there for so
far his men had handled gingerly the
structural iron on the platform and no act
of theirs had given the least jar

  lying at full length on the channel-iron
twining both arms and feet around it bur-
bridge edged on like a snake he could
see the knot of men down under the cone
struts driving with their long bars at the
plug-hole for another pour now and then
glancing up at him with strained faces
slowly he crawled out hugging the struc-
tural shape with all his strength farther
and farther away from its solid riveted
anchorage he crept more and more it
swayed and wabbled with his weight while
the wind wrenched at him with increasing
violence striving with its greedy fingers to
tear him loose and hurl him down into the
abyss below

 i-n-never-was-so-doggone-scairt
-in all my life burbridge confessed to
himself thrpugh chattering teeth as for a
moment he lay still yet clinging tight to
the channel-iron id give a thousand to
be out of this this minute he told him-
self seeking the steadying comfort of his
own voice hell of a lot any of em cares
for me down there why am i here any-
how

  but on he went and at length reached
the dizzy end of the iron and peered at the
open rivet-holes at the end of course
they didnt match-they never do but all
that was needed was a small pry-bar

  norton he croaked pass me that
bar

  he could not see norton who was some-
where out on the railing behind him but
as he stretched forth a free hand backward
across space he felt the cold end of the
steel and his fingers closed around it

  have you got it quaked norton
holding fast to a railing-head with his
other hand and leaning out far toward him

  yes let go-hell i  yelled burbridge
furiously for instead of a light pry-bar
the worthy norton had handed him a
heavy twenty-pound crow its weight
threw burbridge completely out of bal-
ance as he gripped desperately at the
channel-iron and-then an icy terror shiv-
ered through him like an electric shock
galvanizing him into frantic efforts to re-
gain his balance suppose that bar should
drop-and jar loose the hang

durbridge reeled sidewise off the
 channel wrenched inexorably over by
the weight of the heavy crowbar clinging
with viselike grip of legs and one arm he
hung head downward still gripping the
bar slowly his body rose-sank back
with the fruitless effort-rose again-held
for a fleeting instant then dizzily he drew
himself up the other hand was limp with
exhaustion from holding the heavy bar but
still burbridge hung grimly on another
effort and he was lying on top of the
channel-iron again and for the first time
breathing hopefully a last resolute tug
at the crowbar and he hauled it up and
rested it at last across the channel-iron
balancing it against the force of the wind
with rigid clawed hands

  he turned and glared at the trembling
norton you damned - pin-headed -
idiot  he barked at him savagely dont
you know anything

  its the only one we had sir whined
norton you said you wanted a bar

  pry-bar  gasped burbridge livid with
anger havent you any sense- and
then came the thing that his doctor had
often warned him against burbridge felt
that typhoid heart of his leaping in sicken-
ing jerky pulsations and his strength
faded away as his wrists grew numb para-
lyzed where they still gripped the heavy
 the night shilt at jaynesville

crowbar he had intended to crawl back
to safety with it now its weight alone
held it he had no hands to hold it against
the caprice of the wind nothing but his
body to resist being hurled off into the
abyss below

  burbridge groaned the wind seemed
to renew its efforts on both him and the
bar the bar he gasped eyes staring
tf it strikes anything it starts the hang
nothing can stop it once this damn thing
slips away from me

  all unconsciously the workers below
went on with the routine of the pour bur-
bridge hung on face buried in his arms
calling up every ounce of will-power he
possessed to drive away the cramp he
had read somewhere that the mind can
dominate the body-well here was a test
and a good one another gust of wind
shook the channel-iron he set his teeth
and pressed himself fiercely against the
bar to steady it grit determination the
will to hang on and endure until the end
none of them seemed to overcome that
immovable paralysis of his wrists

  a sharp tang of steel on the channel-
iron aroused him he raised his head and
looked cautiously around norton had
possessed himself of a small pry-bar and
was swinging it out to him pendulum-
fashion by a long rope

  burbridge bared savage teeth at him
dont he snarled cant you see im
paralyzed

  but norton could not hear him over the
battle of the cone-gear machinery nor
guess his predicament already with the
next swing the pry-bar rose in high arc
and down it came smart and sure right
into the crook of burbridges elbow it
was the last straw those few pounds of
steel added to the drag of the rope were
all that were needed burbridge losing
his precarious balance toppled over side-
wise again catching his elbow frantically
over the channel-iron-but the big crow-
bar had slipped out from under his arms
and had shot downwards

   lkout below  he yelled staring down-
ward horrified at the bar of falling steel
at his warning shout the knot of men at
the fumace-trough dropped their bars and
fled clang came up a ringing clash of
steel as the bar struck one of the ring of
big struts that braced the blast-furnace
cone a hundred feet below a vast tremor
a shivering thunderous scrape shook the
furnace to its foundations

the blue



  god shes going weve started it
groaned burbridge the hang and
they dont realize it he lay on the
channel-iron and prayed-no words but a
deep unspoken demand on the almighty to
give him back his strength came welling
up from the depths of a strong mans soul
he must have the use of his wrists-must
have the power to warn those men below

tlang came resounding up from the
 depths as the bar crashed on down to
daytons platform another and more
severe tremor shook the furnace walls
burbridges own men feeling that mighty
convulsion under the floor dashed for the
ore-elevator in a body

   burbridge could see the men below look-
ing up their attention had been entirely
on the falling bar they hadnt noticed thie
breaking of the hang if indeed they could
feel it at all they had not a moment more
to live burbridge begged for his strength
he fought with god wrestling with him
furiously his mind insistent urgent con-
centrated in the one purpose that dom-
inated all else he begged and pleaded
as a martyr before a roman emperor for
the right to warn his fellow-men and
under this keen stress he felt the control
of his nerves coming back his palms
moved-his knuckles his fingers with a
gust of unuttered thankfulness to him he
sat up and coiled feverishly the small rope
of the pry-bar then he cast it quickly
surely at the big lever of the alarm-whistle
the shivering channel-iron on which he sat
like a man on horseback the tearing wind
dragging ceaselessly at his body all sense
of the minor dangers had left him and he
worked exultingly as the bar struck the
whistle lever and twined around its pull-
rope with its momentum burbridge
braced himself and pulled fiercely on his
cord scalding hot water gushed out of
the brass mouths of the chimes and spewed
all over him but he ducked low and held
on live steam hissed demoniacally then
a soul-sickening thunderous screech
drowned every other sound

looking down burbridge could see
the furnace men running for their
lives dayton bewildered looked up and
then scudded from the platform a sud-
den riot of exhaust-puffs shot up from the
locomotive as she backed away pushing
her train of ingot-molds at full speed out
of danger on the instant came a dull
book magazine	by warren h miller



rumble of thunder inside the blast-furnace
the crumbling arch of ore in its bowels had
given way it was instantly followed by
the mighty roar of an explosion which
rocked the whole structure like the erup-
tion of a volcano drowning even the
scream of the whistle burbridge gripped
the whipping channel-iron and clung a
great ring of flame shot out around the
filling cone at the furnace-top and blue
flames twenty feet long roared out over
his head while down below through the
bursting bottom of the furnace he could
see the swift rivers of white-hot lava rush-
ing out eating up the iron tracks in the
yard laving around the foundations of
converter and cone struts spreading a lake
of fire far and wide over the yard he
saw white explosions of steam go off like
bombs as the liquid iron flowed around
the hydraulic cylinders under daytons
control-platform blowing them into frag-
ments he saw waves of fire strum in
torrents against the piers of the cone sup-
ports melting them away like wax a
forlorn human atom alone on the breast
of a volcano he could look down and see
hundreds of queer little black forked crea-
tures-fellow human beings-fleeing every
which way from the red terror

  then with a stealthy gliding movement
like a falling elevator the channel-iron on
which he lay began to dip downward low-
ering giddily the struts were melting
away the huge blast-furnace was settling
-leaning nothing on earth could stop it
from crashing down across converter and
mill building alike and it was going over
-with him on it

  burbridge released the whistle-cord
shutting off its distracting din there was
nothing left to do-but wait slowly in-
exorably with one slight jar following an-
other the channel-iron dipped-dipped in
a long and increasing slant

  his watch ticked off the minutes that
were yet left to him of life he was not
afraid of death he had conquered the
fear that had always held him back the
fear of the unknown that comes from a
weak heart he had not even prayed-
god didnt want prayer he wanted man-
hood  at irregular intervals violent explo-
sions shook the blast-furnace rocking his
swaying support like a reed in the wind
he noted them incuriously all that down
below-what did it matter to him so
far as he was concerned it was all over but
the final tumble

  hen he-ell now thats right cu-
rious he ejaculated with sudden in-
terest damned if the old can isnt set-
tling upright again what do you know
about that  he muttered excitedly some-
bodys got a head on him down below

  for as a result of those explosions more
felt than heard by him the blast-furnace
was tending to settle upright once more
like the leaning tower of pisa it had
heeled over some eleven feet and then
started back again

  keen capable minds had been at work
down below and had somehow averted the
catastrophe fifteen minutes passed and
then the corrugated iron door of the ore-
elevator shaft opened leavenworth the
super stepped out

  you jim he bellowed joyously
caught with the goods he jeered point-
ing at the whistle-cord still gripped in bur-
bridges hand say you ought to have
one of those crosses de guerre for that
jim grinned what i want to know is
just why the ol can didnt go over and spill
me all over the yard

  huh think we were going to lose you
-or the furnace-not on ydur life
laughed the super happily weve had
our eyes on you for the last hour come
on down we got your men out by an ex-
tension ladder

  yes but what did you do queried
burbridge excitedly i sure thought noth-
ing on earth could keep her from going
over like the old office stove when those
struts melted away below-

  we dynamited away the strut-piers on
the other side of the furnace the boys
wouldnt give you up while there was a
chance left-slob didnt you feel her
settle back you poor riut shes dropped
nearly twenty feet

  dynamited the supports on the other
side gasped burbridge at the audacious
ruthless originality of it-directed force
without stint to overpower the blinder

far down in the indian ocean on a
murky december afternoon a bluff-
iowed square-stemed old whaling
bark hogged along on a course to
the northward the mary blum had been
two years and four months out from her
home port the catch had been better
than an average for she was comfortably
deep in the water with her cargo of sperm
oil and two tons of whale bone and in a
locker down in the skippers room a col-
lection of tin cans and boxes contained an
aggregate of sixty-odd pounds of amber-
gris

  precious stuff ambergris worth its
weight in gold and much prized by man-
ufacturing perfumers though it is pro-
duced as a waxy mass by disease in the
stomachs and viscera of bull sperm whales
small wonder that the skipper black-
strap morgan kept the locker doubly
locked and daily hoped for an additional
whale that would yield another find suffi-
cient to make the total above the hundred-
pound mark that would have meant at
least a gift of a gold watch and chain from
his ship owners they were generous to
the faithful stewards of their business

  on that murky afternoon skipper mor-
gan paced back and forth on the weather
side of the after-deck and pondered the
matter of whether he should hold to the
course northward into the indian ocean
or buck the trade winds toward the old
whaling areas of the south pacific it was
largely a matter of luck

  but his meditation was sharply inter-
rupted by the cry from the crows-nest a
cry that always brought instant attention
and excitement ah-ho-e-e-e

  where away bawled skipper morgan
knowing by the nature of the call that it
was not whales in sight

  a whale boat suh-three pints on the
lee bow the lookout reported no-o-o
ves-sil in sight suh

  a lost boat simms dyou spose
skipper morgan inquired as his first mate
appeared from the cabin companionway

  id think so simms replied stopping
to look aloft anybody into er he
bellowed to the men in the crows-nest
cahnt see any suh the reply came
keep er off and well run down to it
skipper morgan ordered the man at the
wheel the man hove the wheel up a full
turn and the old bark swung her head
away from the wind until the drawling cry
stead-ay from the crows-nest warned
that the distant whale boat was in line with
the ships head noreast by north the
skipper noted on the compass hold
that he ordered and trotted forward to
the fore-rigging to swing out despite his
paunch and run nimbly up the rigging
presenting a spectacle like a huge pot-
bellied rat as he went up to the crows-
nest

an hour and a half later the old bark
with foreyards aback headed into the
wind in the lee of the drifting boat and
the abode of dread

the second mates boat -and crew were low-
ered to tow the castaway alongside

  whatve we got pete a dead man
skipper morgan asked the second mate as
he looked down from the rail into the bat-
tered boat at the almost nude figure of an
emaciated old man with long scraggly yel-
lowish-white hair and beard who lay hud-
dled under the thwarts

  no suh he aint dead-hes breathin
but hes so damn near gone he aint goin
to last much longah suh

  whats that thing in the stern

  some kind of a funny-lookin skin suh
it looks like its got some water in it
lay on bullies well get the poor
devil aboard as quick as we can skipper
morgan ordered the men who had gathered
along the rail to see the subject of the
ships excitement immediately davit-
tackles were hooked to both boats and
the pair hoisted in the weathered
warped and battered pick-up was let down
on the main-deck and all hands crowded
about to see the dying man to look at the
effects of some queer and deadly disease
and study the strange-looking skin-a
combination of what apparently had once
been the dermic covering of an animal half
goat and half lizard

  the poor devil looks bad dont he
the cook remarked to skipper morgan
spose its scurvy

  skipper morgan studied the seamed
countenance of the shrunken body for a
time it dont look a turble lot like
scurvy either he aint swelled up like
scurvy does taint scurvy -johnny
jump down to my room and bring the
brandy-bottle he ordered the cabin boy

  with the men to help a fair dose of the
strong liquor was poured down the mans
throat causing him to gulp at it for breath
and the gathering of men watched for signs
of stirring consciousness the body lay as
before then the cook brought a half
pitcher of hot pea soup and a tumblerful
was poured after the brandy but no sign
more than deglutition was made by the
cadaverous being

  somehow ive got the idee that he wont
die for a while yet skipper morgan re-
marked -the brandy and soup will brace
him up considable jump down hold bul-
lies and bring up somethin to lay him out
on hes nigh dead for want o sleep
thats whats the matter with him

  a rough pallet of old canvas and bags
was quickly made on the main hatch and

by franklin french

the pitiable creature was moved from the
battered boat to the pallet hours passed
yet no life was visible in the strange being
more than an occasional rise and fall of
the emaciated breast

  if it want for his lookin so id say
hed been boiled in injy ink the cook
remarked to a sailor of the dog watch that
evening pore op feller how ol dyou
spose he is jack

  dunno if looks count for anything
hes ninety to a hunderd id say

it was jiggers in the morning watch that
startled the entire ships company the
watch was busily swabbing the deck with
water from overside and jiggers with
back turned to the main hatch felt a touch
on his ribs and turned to find the grimac-
ing face of the pick-up within a foot of
his own with a scream of horror wild-
eyed jiggers dashed for the forecastle
leaving the men of the watch a-gape at the
spectacle of the corpse-like figure peering
curiously about at its strange surroundings
for a few moments they stood as if spell-
bound and watched the creature rise in its
tottering nakedness and go toward the gal-
ley whence issued the smell of cookery
and the cook surprised by the livid face in
the doorway yelled and leaped through the
opposite door simms the mate came
hurriedly to discover the cause of the ex-
citement and guessed that something was
amiss in the galley but none too soon
for the starved being was in the act of
thrusting a bony hand into a pot of boil-
ing porridge as simms caught an arm and
led him outside

  geuft gooma gooma the old man
begged piteously and clawed at simms re-
straining hands	

  get alive cook bring something we
can let him have simms sharply ordered
the daft open-mouthed cook

  the shaken cook speedily obeyed and
brought a loaf of bread and simms
forced his charge back to the pallet where
the famished old man began to gorge and
choke on huge handfuls from the loaf

  bring some water cook simms or-
dered and restrained the old man from his
ravenous eating until the bread had been
soaked in water

  the old man a pitifully striking rip
van winkle of hoary and yellowed age
greedily seized the soaked lumps of bread
from simms hand and swallowed them as
rapidly as he could
the abode of dread

  geuftma gooma isk he begged
plainly indicating a craving for more as
he peered into simms face

  no no more now bimeby simms
replied with an understanding of the mean-
ing of the unintelligible words of the old
man bimeby more you sleep now he
ordered and forced the old man to lie down
on the pallet again

  the old man struggled for several min-
utes to rise then overcome by the sense of
food in his starved stomach fell asleep

tvauch laughter followed simms narra-
tive of the morning incidents at the
breakfast table in the cabin

  by gorry suh the looks of im is a
plenty to scare a man if he comed round
you sudden-like peter the second mate
declared with a grin he looks worser
nor a lot o dead men ive seen in my
time an i want right anxious to be too
close to them neither

  he does look turble bad-no mistake
bout that-but looks cant kill very fur
simms remarked as he stirred a huge mug
of coffee but that man has seen some
turble doins somewhere an hes had a
awful time o gittin out of it alive likes
not what hes been in wouldve killed
most of us its been a awful thing what-
ever it was

  what do you make out of it simms
skipper morgan asked i cant figger
it out at all i was lookin at that water-
skin last night and i dont know of no
place where youd find a animal like what
that skin came off of it aint all goat ner
all lizard ner snake ive been ashore-on
most o the islands from here to south
america an theres goats on a lot of em
but i never saw anything thats at all
like that thing mustve been an where
in the name o god could that man have
come from-the nearest land to winward
is close on twenty-seven hundred mile
hed never drift that far an be alive
an he aint done anything but drift-no
sail no spars and only a couple o old
splintered sweeps that no man could do
much with and i cant make out how
hes got such a awful look to him he
aint dead an yet if hed been dead for
a month he couldnt look no worse-mebbe
not as bad

  hes been a white man all right-you
can tell that by lookin at im simms
said and hes been in some place for a
long time where he didnt have nobody to

the blue

talk to or he wouldnt have forgot how to
talk this mornin when he says geuma
isk i knew right off he was tryin to say
give me to eat but hed forgotten how
to say it

  do you spose nes nigh as old as he
looks

   taint likely he looks like a awful
old man-white hair an all but hes been
in some place thats made an old man out
of im long before his time to git old
thats the way it looks to me

  and it looks like well have to lam im
to talk to find out anything about im
skipper morgan remarked and i guess
wed better fix a place for him down in
the hold the crew would jump overboard
or mutiny if he was put amongst em in the
focsle

  simms laughed i should say so jig-
gers and the cook dern near jumped over-
board this mornin when the old feller got
close to em and i had to grit my teeth
to take hold of im to take him out the
galley

  well well do the best we can for him
skipper morgan remarked  taint likely
hell die now beins he can eat like that
and tell the cook to feed him along a lit-
tle at a time till he gets so he can stand it
i spose he ought to have some kind o
medicine but i dont know o nothin in
the medicine chest thatd do anything fer
im so well just let im alone for a few
days and let im kind  pick up his reck-
nin so he can tell us somethin about his-
self

the old bark wallowed her way north-
a ward for several days-days that were
eventless to a seamans mind and as the
sun rose in the sky the weather grew
warmer and the breeze more balmy one
day was like the next-a routine of ship
life in the alternation of watches spar
scraping and greasing deck scrubbing and
the constant lookout kept from the crows-
nest and the beams from the brassy moon
of the indian ocean danced on the rolling
sea at night

  the old castaway had been given a shirt
and trousers for his nakedness but his im-
provement was slow as if the age in his
diseased body was loath to yield what it
had gained he made no signs of com-
munication to any except the cook and
that only for food once one of the sea-
men who often performed as tonsor ap-
proached the aged man with a pair of
book magazine



shears and made signs of cutting the long
yellowish-white hair and beard gibber-
ing with fright the old man scuttled down
the main hatch steps and remained out of
sight of the deck for two days

  but as time passed he doddered about
the decks or sat on the break of the cabin
deck and gazed at the sea for periods of
hours then as the days wore on the
crew noticed that he listened more and
more to such conversation as went on
around him though he gave no sign that
he understood and the development of
the habit gave simms the mate an idea

he went to his room and brought ome
worn well-read books and placed them in
the old mans hands and a miracle hap-
pened for a time the old man peered into
meaningless pages then with new com-
panions he disappeared into the hold to
sprawl on his pallet and spend hours over
the enigma of the printed word and
memory revived for it was observed
later that he was sedulously studying and
puzzling over the unfamiliar lines and the
men in the night watches often heard
strange gibberish from the darkness of the
hold the old man was earnestly seeking
again the comfort of his mother speech
and a day came when he approached
simms with the dilapidated books and
said me bux more it

  you want more books to eat simms
laughingly asked

  yuss

  simms replaced the books with others
much to the delight of the old man who
promptly disappeared into the hold with
the new treasures

  youd think hed lam to talk faster
skipper morgan remarked he had wit-
nessed the transaction of the books

  well ill tell you suh what i think
the trouble is simms made reply hes
been  through somethin awful-a heap
sight worsen weve ever dreamt of an
its hangin in his mind like a blanket what
he cant see through

  dont seem reasonable to spose a man
would forget to talk does it

  yes suh right reasonable lots o
people forget who they are-and in a
mighty short time too an like as not
this old feller aint talked to nobody for a
lifetime

  well i dunno but what it looks that
way skipper morgan remarked but
if itd been me id have talked to myself
a lot if thered been nobody else to talk to

by franklin french

yessuh i surely would id have climbed
up on the big rocks wherever i was and
preached sermons what the wind never
heard before yessuh id have lamed a
lot by just listenin to myself some peo-
ple lam a heap that way

  simms and the second mate laughed
over that for they knew skipper morgans
sea dogmas of religion in general preach
unto thyself as much as thou please sail
as thou wilt the winds are free

the weeks quadrupled into months the
old bark followed a course far north-
ward into the trade winds thence south
again toward the western australian coast
twice crossing the great sperm whale
grounds after a months cruise through
the waters north of australia where two
fifty-barrel whales were captured and cut-
in the whaler headed northward again
across the trade winds and the tropics and
info the warm japan stream and plowed
onward into the north pacific breasting
gales and calms with equal contentment
only the direst and fiercest of natures
moods-the hurricane and the typhoon-
disturb a whalers routine

  then one day a school of five sperm
whales was sighted at seven miles feeding
contentedly in a tide rip the school was
wary but as the sun sank beyond the
western horizon a monster bull whale was
lashed with rolling lines to the bark and
the crew alert to the danger of losing the
prize by a sudden change of weather
promptly began the work of cutting the
endless strip that spirals the leviathan from
head to fluke and rapidly removing the
blubber for the try-works and the oil
casks and as skipper morgan and mate
simms joked and laughed with the aban-
don of happy men over their midnight
coffee their eyes often turned to a grey
mass of fresh ambergris that lay on a
canvas near the cabin companionway

  he was a good fish skipper morgan
remarked as he lit his pipe all o a hun-
derd barrels o ile and ninety pounds o
gris him an them two down in twenty-
five south since we picked up the old man
-i dunno but what wed ought to keep the
old feller board-ship for the next vyage
out looks like he brought the luck with
him dont it

  simms laughed at that well cordin
to what a sailor thinks of the luck in a
black cat or a preacher board-ship he
couldnt have
the abode of dread

  well since i let him have my testa-
ment hes been doin a reglar bizness o
preachin down in the hold o nights spe-
cially when its blowin hard

 preachin dyou reckon he gets
scared

  no taint that its more like he
doesnt want anybody to hear im last
week when that blow was on tinker and
cracklins had the middle watch on the
main-deck and they said they stood in
the lee o the galley and listened to the
old feller layin it off from genesis to some-
wheres else all through the watch he had
to stop right often for tryin to think o
words to talk with like he couldnt think
of em fast enough but he was meanin
what he said and the men say he aint
no fool at it either

  well if hes talkin to god bout things
i reckon hell come out all right bimeby
but its damn queer he dont get no better
to look at he looks just as bad as he
did the day we found him and hes gettin
so that he wont go near anybody else any
more than he can help just as if he didnt
want nobody near him

 simms laughed again you could
hardly blame him for that the crew
wont go near him if they can help it and
he was bound to see it sooner or later
you just cant help feelin that hes a dead
man thats walkin round-thats how the
crew looks at it and they just cant help
it er i spose they would

the summer months passed and the old

	whaler skirted the archipelagic aleu-
tians nosing her way westward homeward
bound the results of the long voyage
were beyond the expectations of the be-
ginning of the voyage three years before
twenty-one whales had filled the cargo
space in the hold with seventeen hundred
barrels of oil upward of four thousand
pounds of whale bone were stored in the-
lazarette and a little more than one hun-
dred and fifty pounds of precious amber-
gris was locked in the lockers of the skip-
pers room and there was yet time to
capture a right whale and extract from
five hundred to one thousand pounds of
whalebone from its cavernous mouth but
the crew counted the probable days before
the hook splashed overside in san fran-
cisco bay and ended the long voyage for
them enough was plenty and skipper
morgan saw the questioning looks in the
eyes of the men-and wise in sea lore he

the blue

understood he too had visions of a
homecoming that were good to conjure
with

  well square away for home with the
first good breeze mr simms he an-
nounced to the mate one afternoon

  heres hopin well have a souwest gale
before the dog watch goes off tonight
jiggers who had the trick at the helm
exclaimed and he vented his joy in a
clattering jig that sent skipper morgan
and simms off into roars of laughter

  but light breezes delayed the squaring
away for more than a week and one
morning soon after dawn the crew scur-
ried into the boats and raced after three
right whales that had found a patch of
their favorite globigerina about two miles
away on the weather bow simms boat-
steerer drove a harpoon deep into one huge
bull and it raced off to windward with the
boat in tow which was soon lost to sight

  but the third mates boat had better
luck the boatsteerer drove his harpoon
as the boat crossed a whales back and the
deadly tonite bomb fired by the harpoon
killed the quarry instantly the boats
crew waved the black flag and waited for
the bark pete returned after an hours
chase of the third whale and with a sup-
ply of food for an emergency was sent to
aid simms the bark worked up to the
dead whale cut-in the blubber and hoisted
the great head on deck to cut out the bone
and made sail to work to windward in the
direction that simms had gone all day
skipper morgan kept an anxious watch
from the crows-nest for the missing boat
but nothing was seen until the gloom of
night was settling on the sea and sky
then petes boat returned to the ship

  the black flag is up fifteen mile to
winward suh pete bawled while yet a
quarter of a mile from the ship

  good enough quoth skipper morgan
and he raced joyfully down the rigging
from the crows-nest to attend to the dump-
ing of the discarded whale head

  a thirty-mile chase he suggested to
pete when the boat had been hoisted to
the davit heads

  yes suh an mr simms had a hot
time o killin im too-fiahed five bombs
into im in the fight an when the whale
was finly dead he sunk

  sunk

  yessuh-down a tousand fathoms i
give mr simms more line so he could let
im go down furder if he had to
book magazine

  simms can hold him then

  yessuh hes got im

  theres a whaleman for you skipper
morgan remarked pridefully and set about
working the ship to the sunken whale 

rawn was breaking when the line in
 simms boat was passed up the side of
the vessel and the boat hoisted in

  a right good job mr simms skipper
morgan greeted

  a fifteen-thousand-dollar fish needs it
sometimes simms replied and took the
mug of hot coffee the cook was offering

  a harpoon with a long shank and heavy
weights was attached to the taut whale
line with guides and with a heavy line
fastened to it was let loose to go whizzing
into the depths for a stronger hold on the
dead whale the donkey-engine in the
hold was brought into use and in an hour
the largest whale of all the catch was in
lashings beside the bark

  cappun what do dat bromyter say
a barbadoes colored man saucily inquired
from among the crew as they were cutting
in the blubber

  it says well square away for home if
we get that whale in by noon skipper
morgan goodnaturedly replied

  the barbadoes man promptly kicked the
man before him and ordered cut fastah
niggah

  the man who had felt the kick looked
backward with the remark begob
theres wanst in a whoile a toime a nagur
can kick an irishman an get ahf wit his
loife niver thry it agin

  with the blubber and bone on deck the
old whaler squared away for home soon
after the noon sight and a happy crew
began the work of trying out the additional
one hundred and seventy barrels of oil and
cleaning the new lot of fifteen hundred and
fifty pounds of whalebone-and praying
for wind

  shes just about as deep in the water
as i care to have her skipper morgan
remarked to simms shes got all she
can carry to my likin

  ninety thousand dollars worth i figure
it simms mentioned ive done worse
throughout the later weeks the old
castaway had grown more aloof for days
the only one to see him was the cook who
handed food and drink down the hatch to
the shy old creature even when the crew
stowed the oil the men caught only
glimpses of him lying far back under the

by franklin french

deck on the casks under some deadlight
but always absorbed in some book or paper
to the exclusion of all else conjecture
as to his origin or circumstances bad dwin-
dled to an occasional remark concerning his
manner and custom no one had heard
his laughter nor had anyone seen aught
of anything that meant the light humor
of smiles laughter in him was dead but
many of the men had heard his preach-
ments in the dark watches and for a time
they had marveled no change had come
into his physical being that they had seen
he was to their eyes the same cadaverous
creature that had been taken on board
almost a year before his appearances on
deck-the times when he huddled against
the weather rail or rigging and gazed at
the dancing wave crests of the sea for
hours-grew less frequent such appear-
ances had meant a shunning of that part
of the deck by the crew yet no one had
seen or surmised the change in the dulled
eyes nor sensed the light of reason and the
profound thought that hgd grown up in
him shunning they had failed to see

   allowing comfortably along on
 the course before westerly weather
the old whaler approached the california
coast and during a sunny october after-
noon the mountain crests of the coast line
steadily arose above the eastern horizon
the crew ambled about the decks and
feasted their eyes on the distant blue pan-
orama and skipper morgan pacing back
and forth on the cabin deck paused now
and then to gaze landward it was a wel-
come sight suddenly skipper morgan
turned to simms

  say simms the old feller in the hold
aint never told us nothin bout who he is
nor where he came from he said id
ought to get that straightened out right
away for the custom house theyve got
to know all about them things get the
old feller up here and lets see if he can
tell us anything

  aye sir simms replied and went to
the main hatch a few minutes later he
came back followed by the old man whose
emaciated figure presented a weird pa-
thetically hideous spectacle in the slanting
sunlight as he clutched simms testament
to his scrawny bosom and faced skipper
morgan

  abashed by the steady look in the eyes
of the deathly being skipper morgan hes-
itated for words you see taint like i-
the abode of dread

i want to-to bother you none he began
but you see ive got to ask you somethin
about-well ive got to fix up somethin
for the custom house you see its like
that

the old man stood for several moments
silent yet his eyes did not waver skip-
per morgan waited for a time then asked
youve larned to talk-havent you-
since you came aboard

  yes sir i have the old man replied
causing his hearers to start at his guttural
croaks it was as though a raven had
spoken the crew began to gather along
the rail and the break of the cabin deck to
witness the strange proceedings the
books helped me remember

  where did you come from-i mean
where were you born

  the old man hesitated for a few mo-
ments and let his gaze wander to the dis-
tant mountains then for support he
leaned against the galley coaming

  my memory availeth naught he said
it faileth much and remembereth but a
land like yonder mountains where people
did live in houses and wherein was an
great school

  a college-was it

  yes sir and we did learneth to preach
the words of god

  but how did you come to be away down
in the indian ocean

  i knoweth not where it be

  skipper morgan pondered didnt you
go to sea-some way

  i remembereth but a woman who wast
my mother perchance and a kind old man
and they did tell me to abide in a ship
like unto this one for a time i wast sick
inside me and goeth not to the great
school as much as i did wish and i did
goeth upon the sea

  a ship like this one skipper morgan
mused aloud what was her name-do
you remember that

  the old man seemed to study the ques-
tion for a time

  a name was upon the hinder part like
unto c-o-r-m-o-r-a-n-t he spelled it
was of letters of great size as of twice the
span of my hands

c kipper morgan suddenly looked at
simms that was the old cormorant
-out o new bedford i went boatsteerer
in er nigh thirty year ago and she went
a vyage to the south pacific bout twenty
year ago and never was heard of again

the blue

he turned to the old man you was in
her

  yes sir

  where was she lost

  i knoweth not i remembereth only
the wrath of the sea that did smite the
ship as it lieth among the great rocks
she struck on a reef probly that no-
body knew anything about lots o whal-
ers have done that was it on some island
was there any land there

 no sir only rocks and the men
goeth away in boats we saw them not
again

who never saw them again you
yes sir i and the man who sang
how was that what made him sing
i knoweth not he sang much-and
laughed too and he did jump into the
sea and cometh not back again

  went crazy lots do when theyre
lost at sea but what become o you-
where did you go to

  i knoweth not it was the very great
bad place

  what was it-an island was there
water all around it

  yes sir i did walketh about it one day
to see if it was all bad and yea it was
worse than where we did live

  where who lived

  the people who did find me they
were green and black people and very
kind were they

  how many of em

  at first there was as many as three
shipsful but some died and the serpents
did eat many and the odas trees killed
some and when the white wind came
some died with sleep there were few
more to live than my fingers when the fire
burned the land and the sea became angry
and smote over it

  it sunk in the sea

  yes sir a very great bad and evil time
was it

okipper morgan was plainly bewil-
 dered by the old mans statements in
many phases the story seemed preposterous
in the light of what he knew concerning all
the oceans and their islands and coasts
yet there seemed no lack of truth in the
aged man as he calmly stood and held the
testament to himself even that was an act
of faith skipper morgan needed a way
to belief

  how did them people find you where
was you
book magazine

  in my boat on the sea there were
many of them in canoes and they goeth
to find a new land to dwell upon
for the land whence they had come was
smote by the sea and was no more after
many days they found me and after many
more days we saw the great bad place
but we did not know it was bad before the
great wind came to destroy the canoes
and we could not travel forth again we
putteth many stones in the boat and itwas
spared the wrath of the great wind
hurricane probly

  yes sir it was even very great and
it came many times afterward and always
with very great wrath

  yes i know what they are ive been
through a half a dozen of em theyre a
derned sight worsen any wrath there ever
was-blowin the paint right off o the
woodwork skipper morgan asserted he
was beginning to perceive his bearings in
the strange tale for hurricanes were within
his scope of experience at sea and like a
cautious navigator when the orb of day is
obscured he mentally decided to reckon
from the simple facts of dead reckoning

  how did you folks live on the island
what did you have eat-cocoanuts

  i knoweth not-the cocoanuts but we
did find thereof many berries and like-
wise also the mahno which did grow in
the ground like unto the bigness of my leg
and likewise also the dombra which is of
the bigness of my head and grows upon
trees we did break it with stones for to
eat

  them was cocoanuts skipper morgan
commented

  and also we did make sharp sticks in
the water to catch pish fish by night the
serpents swam in the sea to eat them and
we did catch many pish fish when they
jumped upwards from the sea not to be
caught and eaten by the great serpents
what did them pish fish look like
skipper morgan wanted to know still de-
termined to array the minor points first

  they were of the bigness of yourself
they went very swiftly in the sea and
did say pish from out their heads when
they did swim

  porpoises declared skipper morgan
what else did you have to eat

  a very great many of small fishes did
live in the sea also we caught them with
spear sticks and the mombo came to
sleep on the sand by the sea and lay the
eggs of them

by franklin french



  sea turtles quoth skipper morgan
what else

  also the birds of the sea made many
nests that we might eat of the eggs like-
wise we slew them with spear sticks for
meat and raiment

  well thatd be right easy to do cause
they aint a mite scary when theyre nestin
and we used to gether their eggs by the
tubful off o some o the islands in the
nestin season skipper morgan said
but what kind of a thing was it that you
got that waterskin off of taint all goat
ner lizard ner snake a right curus an-
imal id say

  yes it was of the mosa they had
hair and two legs for part with horns and
long ears upon their heads and were
with scales like the serpents on the long
part that came after and they sat upon
their tails even to four paces high when
they did eat of the trees also when sleep
came upon them they did hang from the
trees by their tails and likewise we slew
the unwary among them with staves for
meat but they ran with swiftness and
for many days betimes they slept not that
even so we did eat no meat of their flesh
though they did live in many places and
by night they did ha-ha much in great
noises like scoffers and fools and weak-
wits that we lived in fear of them and the
serpents and the great wind though many
times the fearsome things cameth not in
answer to the ha-ha noises of them

ill be dad-burned if it aint too much

	fer my reckonin skipper morgan de-
clared scratching his head in perplexity
his mind was threshing about in a sea of
doubt yet dead-reckoning is dependable
under certain circumstances them laugh-
in goats was funny animals-i never heard
o nothin like em before but how did
you get water theres a lot o islands
all through the archypellygo where there
aint a drop o water

  even so but the water of springs cam-
eth out of the rocks and ran down upon
the sea and some were hot and some
were cold and of some we did not drink
lest we died thereof and always when
the land was angry and made noises and
shaking and fire and smoke to send the
white wind to creep upon us the waters
did become green like unto the trees and
the grass while we slept in the many days
of the white wind and some did die
could thatve been fog simms
the abode of dread

the blue

skipper morgan asked the mate though
his manner expressed a doubt

   taint likely probly gas from them
volcanic fires

  sure thats what it was-and the
smell of it knocked em over while it was
blowin round em

  yea and it did maketh us sleep as
unto death for many days and we moved
not the old man croaked earnestly and
the waters became more vile and was green
like the grass much even to the great sick-
ness of our bellies when we drank thereof

  brimstone id imagine-er somethin
like and itd be like paint fer drinkin
water skipper morgan remarked them
volcanic islands are all purty much like
that speshly the little ones and they aint
much of a place id care to live on and
have to depend on rain for water

dut skipper morgan had begun to glean
 some points of drift leeway and the set
of currents in the apparently preposterous
narrative the loom of distant headlands
were in the murky weather to leeward and
he decided to try bolder waters

  what kind o trees was them poppas
trees-the ones that killed the kanakas
he asked

  the old man silently held up his bony
hands with backs together and worked
the fingers violently

  they were like unto that he said sim-
ply but of a very great bigness

  crabs queried skipper morgan

  devil fish suggested simms

  did they live in the sea skipper
morgan asked

  na they grew upon the land they
were ferocious like unto beasts of the
testament and did slay other trees other
trees did not grow near unto them lest
they die

  the ships company exchanged glances
of skepticism it was beyond them skip-
per morgan looked at simms with ques-
tioning eyes

 what do you make out o that
simms

  well i dont know suh sounds like
they must a been like devil fish bein
trees

  sounds demed funny remarked skip-
per morgan what was they like did
they have long arms onto em like this
he asked the old man and extended his
arms for description

  yes sir two and three and often-

times as many as all my fingers did they
have arms like unto the bigness of yonder
cask and long near unto the span of this
ship were they and grew upon the main
part by many directions and they moved
about with great joy upwards in the air
when the rains came upon them and did
lie in wait upon the ground when we came
nigh unto them to seize and devour the
blood of them they caught yea and one
great odas slew three women and one
old man one day and maketh them bloody
in death they went to find berries and
the odas did lie in wait and seized upon
them with great fierceness many times
did they that and mayhap two score of
the people did perish from them but they
were frightened of the great wind and
wound themselves tight about with their
arms when the wrath of the wind was upon
them lest they perish and we did find
to cast sand upon them and maketh them
believe that the great wind was come
and likewise they wound themselves tight
about in fright of the wind that seemed
upon them

  but they did seize upon the great ser-
oents and maketh mighty battles of fight
with them even unto death for he who
was mightieth prevailed yea even to
nine days they fought betimes and maketh
mighty struggles in the wrath of their
spirits for the odas tree did lusteth for
blood to devour

  by gum i dont know what to make
o that skipper morgan declared sol-
emnly and thrust both hands into his
trousers pockets with an air of skepticism

  something like what i seen once in the
straits o malacca simms remarked
an it sounds just about as strange as
them trees too we was cornin up the
straits and one afternoon a big junk in
shore from us got fouled by one o them
big devil fish like there is down there an
lemme tell you there was a heap o ki-
kiin around that junk for a while till
them coolies cut off some o them big arms
what the old devil fish had around them
most folks wouldnt believe that but i
seen it

  yes ive seen some o them big fellers
myself skipper morgan remarked and
it looks just as reasonable fer somethin
like that to be on land somewheres as to
be prowlin around in the sea say what
was them big sarpints like he asked the
old man

  also they were of a great bigness the
book magazine



old man declared in his solemn croaking
voice even so long as the span of this
ship some were they and there were to
three score and mayhap more of them
caesars ghost they couldnt have
been reglar snakes skipper morgan
queried incredulously

  i knoweth not of snakes but they did
have monstrous great heads-like unto
the books saith the frog hath-with vile
and long fang-teeth to slay and devour
prey and upon the sides of them were
flat arms even as the pish fish and they
were bony with scales like unto stones
and betimes they bloweth mightily and
maketh smoke as of hot water when they
did lie upon the land and grunteth youf
youf even as the book saith of swine when
they did sleepeth

hat on earth did they live on
skipper morgan wanted to know
even the dead reckoning of the narrative
was slipping

  they did go by night to slay the whales
and hunteth the pish fish

  god save us killin whales

  yea many times have mine eyes seen
them slay the whales also they cometh
in the night many times to seek us for
prey and we did live in fear of them for
they did devour melta and her two babies
and oomba the chieftain and many oth-
ers and one day jheu and lasta and me
we did go to find the mahno for food and
cameth a great serpent which did seize
upon lasta and maketh jheu and me near
to death with fear but we did maketh
travail against the serpent and smote him
with great stones yea and i smote him
ten times on the eye with a great stone
and availeth nothing for he did eat
lasta and grunteth youf youf for sleep
to come upon him in contentment and we
did beat our breasts with despair and
went away in grief and sorrow for lasta
and like unto vultures as the books saith
the serpents did come to seek they who
died in sickness yea many times did they
come

  want there no way to kill the demed
things

  one we slew a great wind did break
many trees and a serpent of much bigness
eateth of whale-flesh and lieth among the
trees to sleep and grunt and we did tie
two trees about his neck with the boat
rope like unto the books saith a yoke doth
and when he wakened many trees did he

by franklin french

break with a mighty struggling yea and
the mosas did come in multitudes and mak-
eth much ha-ha noises for the defeat of a
great enemy for he availeth nothing
against the yoke and on the sixth day he
did grunt no more and by great rejoic-
ing we did flay him from out his skin to
make an great boat before the serpents
did find and devour him-which was good
skipper morgans mind was beginning to
ride comfortably in a gale of doubt-the
slaughter of leviathans had been his life-
long business and he chuckled as he re-
marked to simms

  i reckon we couldve had a right good
time gunnin them sarpints with some
whalin gear simms

  simms laughed  twouldve been a
good deal like shootin house-cats to walk
up to em while they was gruntin and
plump tonite bombs into em with a shoul-
der-gun not much fun in that

  what become o the rest o the people
are they on the island yet skipper mor-
gan queried turning to the old man again

  i knoweth not there is no island be-
cause of the great bad and evil time that
did come upon it

  well ill be derned what happened
to it

  even in the night it cometh upon the
island and did make to burn mightily with
monstrous fires and great pillars of smoke
and clouds of hot water and burneth to
the heavens above in great wrath to destroy
us and all living things upon it and it
did shake and rend the land in upheavings
and falling down and maketh the rocks and
stones to flow like unto water and hiss and
burn mightily and behold the land did
begin to sink into the sea and when
the day was come again we did flee upon
the sea in the boat and the serpent boat
to spare our lives from the mighty wrath of
the land

  well whfere did the rest go to-the ka-
nakas

  i knoweth not for we did travel many
days upon the sea and did pray to see the
land of some place again lest we perish of
the great hunger for we did have but
little of the dried pish fish and mosa to
eat thereof and mayhap a score of sea
birds that we did catch with spear sticks
and by night did come a great wind upon
us-i in my boat and they in theirs-and
the rope which was as rot with great age
did breaketh and when the day was come
i saw them not with mine eyes though i
the abode of dread



did look with great fear lest i not see
them again and i maketh the boat to
go this way and that to find them again
but without avail then the great sleep
cometh upon me-how many days i
knoweth not-and i ope my eyes when
the day was come and behold i am on
this ship

	a wed by the narrative not a member
 of the crew moved the old man
stood holding the testament against him-
self with his blue and bony hands and
silently regarded the rising mountains if
cavil there was to be he apparently cared
little about it he had told of whence he
had come there was naught else to tell

  skipper morgan pondered the horrific
episodes of the narrative for he could
neither reject nor believe it there were
elements in it of which he had sure knowl-
edge-if they were true a posteriori the
others were true for the old mans condi-
tion the decayed and rotted whaleboat
and the strange looking mosa skin were
bits of indubitable evidence in the end
he did not know what he thought the
thing was beyond him as was the parable
of jonah and the whale he knew of no
whale that could have swallowed jonah-
of that he was sure yet he did not care
to cast doubt upon the scriptures for it
might have been in some other way the
old mans history was something to be
studied from more than one angle later
perhaps the thing would be plainer he
too looked at the coastal mountains for a
time well i suppose youll be mighty
glad to git back to your people after bein
away so long he remarked to the silent
old man

   nay croaked the old man it is not
for me

  why well be in an have the hook
down by midnight if the breeze holds up
skipper morgan said

  even so

   well youll be there wont ye

by franklin french

  nay i goeth to my father

  skipper morgan paused demed if i
know what that means

  there is a great gratitude in my heart
that ye did save me from the sea until now
for there is much that i did seek and i
have found the old man declared as he
nervously fingered the testament many
years did my people mourn in sorrow and
grief and they have forgotten though it is
but a span and i shall greet them before
my father who lovest all things and even
as ye did unto me the people on yonder
mountains will do likewise unto me for i
am a leper unto them i goeth not among
them

  derned if i can see what youre goin
to do skipper morgan declared

  thus and so the old man croaked
solemnly and stepped to the cabin rail
and raising his eyes to heaven with ex-
tended suppliant gesture he said i
come o father i come and before the
startled skipper or crew could act he
stepped over the rail and dropped like a
plummet inco the sea still clutchirg the
testament and disappeared in the depths

jvfan overboard into the star-
board boat bullies simms gal-
vanized into sudden action cried to the
startled crew as he leaped to the davits
the crew rushed to follow him and many
hands snatched at the tackles to lower the
boat

  a few moments later ere the boat had
started downward the skipper still watch-
ing the spot astern checked them

  avast lowerin twouldnt be no use
the old feller aint cornin up any more
mr simms i reckon hes right about that
hes been through a-plenty and i dont
reckon wed ought to blame him for not
wantin to go through whatd be a demed
sight worse well let the custom-house
think what it dern pleases for im begin-
nin to hope hell have no trouble in findin
his folks make the boat fast again

caroline otherwise known as
mrs arthur alexander tobie was
a stunning woman even white
folks freely admitted that they
had been known to stand at the corner of
jimpsons drugstore with eyes a-goggle
and mouths agape intent and single-
minded staring at caroline as she came
buxomly and breezily down the street
even quality folks were affected thus by
caroline in her holiday regalia mrs ed-
gar quinctilius jepson for instance the
very uppitiest of the society white folks
had been observed no later than yesterday
smitten with envy of chocolate-brown mrs
tobie

  caroline was coming down seventh ave-
nue on the glaring sunny side of the
street superbly conscious of her eminent
attractiveness to the eye her ample feet
were shod in white canvas with wide rib-
bon bows the arching columns of her
shapely nether limbs were hosed in pink
silk her gown was lavender the gift of
governor pattisons wife for whom caro-
line had cooked and carolines personal
selection her hat was a broad-brimmed
picture piece of a rather nondescript cream
gayly bedizened with two orange plumes
this splendor all-sufficient in itself was
topped and crowned by a cerise parasol

  calvin plummer leaning against the
lintel-post of the elite pool parlor con-
sidered caroline justly the most splendid

sight in america she affected his heart
most agreeably sending through his frame
a little surge of warmth that beggared that
of the busy sun he straightened up fum-
bled at his tie uncrossed his long legs
smoothed out the wrinkles in his gray cool-
cloth suit rolled his eyes with a show of
ecstatic white and with a wide sweep of
his hat stepped briskly up to mrs tobie

  you is sholy lookin mos powful
scrumptious this fine aftnoon mis to-
bie said calvin

  thats the way i is feelin miste plum-
mer responded the lady now that tri-
flin no-count pusson what done invig-
orated me into marryin him with his lyin
tongue is puffickly sure drapped into the
discard i feels mo like a chitterin young
gal than like a lone widow woman

  yesm said calvin grinning an
thats jes how yo is lookin mis tobie
like a young gal-prezackly like one of
them chitterin young gals-only mo so
yesm mo so an thats jes like it had
ought to be these young gals-i isnt
sayin they aint all right mis tobie but
compared to a matoor and accomplished
female like what you is what is jes as
young-lookin an spry as any of em and
is got besides a powful lot of good jedg-
ment-why wheah is they thats all i
axes you-wheah is they

  mrs tobie laughed with a fine show of
teeth


surance money

  why continued calvin replying to
his own rhetorical question i tells you
wheah they  is-they isnt nowheahs
thats wheah they is

the evidence of calvins pocketed fin-

	gers corroborated his notion that he
still had the six bits judge green had paid
him that morning for mowing the judicial
lawn calvin as it happened saw mighty
little of the wherewithal being rather un-
favorably known among white folks as
about the laziest darky in town he had
been a time-server for three weeks to
make the necessary money to buy the
natty gray suit he was now wearing he
had done no work since obtaining the fine
raiment except the lawn-mowing this morn-
ing acquiring the suit had left him ele-
gant but very languid very averse to caus-
ing his brow again to bead from honest
toil he was tiredr very tired

  now if he was to treat caroline at the
perfection ice cream parlor it would en-
tail more labor to replenish his pocket
for no gentleman could afford to be abso-
lutely without spending-money even if
it were only two bits a great gulf yawned
between him who possessed it and him
who ignobly possessed it not calvin was
torn for a moment between ambition and
conservation but it was a quick sharp
tearing and there was no question about
ambition winning

  its a powful wam aftnoon mis
tobie said calvin softly an that
bein the case what would yo-all say to a
dish of ice cream

  the lady proved anything but loath
three minutes later they were seated upon
opposite sides of a little table in the shady
depths of the perfection ice cream parlor
worse fate the lady was ordering happy
holiday perfection combination sundae-
thirty-five cents calvin became swiftly
preoccupied with mental arithmetic sup-
pose as indeed wasnt unlikely caroline
hinted at another his arithmetical
equipment stood the strain twice thirty-
five was seventy he was for the moment
in a quandary

  finally he decided upon lemon phos-
phate-five cents and determined to sip
it very slowly with great care it might
outlast two sundaes

  is been troubled with indigestion he
explained the docte he say drink lemon
phosphate hits powful good fo diges-
tion he say

the blue

  mrs tobie giggled it oughter be
she said its powful thin food it
wont give yo no gout miste plummer
thats possolutely sho

  calvin laughed uneasily and changed the
subject

  so the surance company done decided
that miste tobie was fo cetain de-
ceased he inquired

  mrs tobie nodded uh-huh it was
jes like that ahthuh alexande pusson to
go off an be secretive bout dyin theah
was a time when i jes bout completely
despaied of eve gettin that surance
money miste plummer fo a yeah and
a half he done held me out of my rights
when with jes a little mo carefulness i
might have had the surance money the
vey day of his demise thats what care-
lessness does but then that ahthuh
alexande neve did show no considera-
tion

jwirs tobie had been quite a topic
about town for a long time eighteen
months previously her care-free spouse
had disappeared over night from the stem-
wheel steamer river belle to caroline
he was worth about ten dollars a month
alive and one thousand dollars spot cash
dead it was a well-known fact that he
couldnt swim it seemed highly improb-
able that gathering momentum as he
stoked he had flung himself along with a
four-foot length of cottonwood in the fur-
naces of the river belle and been incin-
erated neither was he naturally of a se-
cretive or deserting nature he was on the
contrary an amiable omnipresent uxorious
person who had to be driven from his
home to his work he was the last person
on earth that one might expect to encoun-
ter in a port of missing men

  in view of all this it seemed needlessly
cruel in the surance company to require
something in the nature of visible remains

  there were a number of young negroes
not so particular as the surance company
quite ready to step into mr tobies shoes
at the risk of bigamy-but they were not
in carolines eyes upon the eligible list
those who might be eligible-notably cal-
vin plummer and his rival husky young
george washington sparks-seemed how-
ever to regard mrs tobie with the waiting
eye the very personal charm of these
young gentlemen had rendered them
through vast experience cautious mrs
tobie with the surance money of the late
book magazine

arthur alexander was no doubt a fine
catch without it she was more likely to
be an expense she was an elegant
dresser she had her own ideas upon the
subject of husbands she liked them to be
puvidin so calvin and george with-
out relinquishing their status as suitors
had nevertheless let it be understood that
with a vast respect for their countrys mar-
riage laws they were waiting proof of car-
olines singly blessed state before actually
committing themselves

  the rumor was afloat that this morning
one thousand dollars had been deposited to
the dusky charmers credit in the first
national bank

  so said caroline though naturally i
is not an onfeelin pusson i was relieved
to heah that the compny finally accepted
the demise of my fome husband

  how come asked calvin curiously
how come they do

  two nigges long the levee bove jack-
sons bend done confess that the body come
shore that same week and they bury him
an with what proof they give the com-
pny done give up the sputifyin they
see i reckon how it aint no mo use
um-m said calvin ise powful
glad to heah bout that mis tobie i
done been waitin fo them proofs fo a long
time now

  mrs tobie scooped up the last succu-
lent spoonful of milky syrup and chopped
nuts and smiled so amiably that the edge
on her words escaped calvin

  yes miste plummer yo has

  an now caline pursued calvin i
jes wants to say to yo-i jes wants to
say-to say i been-

  mrs tobie laughed then yo bette
say it faster than what yo is i is due at
the ladies civic and economic society in
prezackly ten minutes

  alvin cast a quick look about they
 were seated in a curtained alcove and
no one else was in sight he hitched his
chair rapidly around the table and seized
the resplendent ladys plump hand

  caline he said fervidly is been
in love with yo fo the longest time i
been wantin to ask yo eve since yo hus-
band got hisself drowneded would yo
marry me i wouldve axed yo a long time
ago only lawyer bricker he say to me

surance money

  so concluded the lady rising and
loosening her hand without visible emotion
ef yo means business calvin yo knows
my platfom	

  yefm said calvin sadly

  i mus be goin said mrs tobie
smilinf brightly thank yo fo yo de-
licious refreshments miste plummer

  don mention em mis tobie said
calvin abstractedly

  seventeen dollars and four bits he
had sever had so much visible wealth at
one iime in his life still thrice hed had
over ten dollars it was possible but a
job jobs were scarcer than hens teeth
right now there were lots more men than
jobs besides calvin wasnt considered
possible timber for any job but the odd job
white folks wouldnt think of hiring him
and what colored employer-

  i undestand continued mrs tobie
havin heared him say so a couple of days
ago that pason crackweather was prog-
nosticatin ove hirin a clerk fo his gro-
cery store

  is that so demanded calvin eagerly
is yo tell that triflin geoge bout that
too

   no i isnt exackly tell him said mrs
tobie i isnt exackly tell him but-

ut calvin was gone

  his idols avowal for self-determina-
tion hadnt disturbed him very much he
knew that he had a wheedling way with
him that was very effective with women
he had a really supreme confidence in his
ability to get his fingers on quite a lot of
those dollars if the lady married him

  the two conditions-seventeen dollars
and four bits and a job-summed up to-
gether verged upon the onerous but a
thousand dollars was a mighty lot of
money he didnt know exactly how much
it was he did know however that he
had frequently accomplished miracles with
five dollars and a thousand-how many
times five was a thousand

  he paused at lawyer brickers door and
inquired

  two hundred times cal two hun-
dred and the shyster lawyers face
broke into a thousand laugh-wrinkles

  two hunderd said calvin awed
golly that am a powful lot of money-f
it am fo a fack

  and forthwith he hot-footed it toward
parson crackweathers little store

  parson crackweather plied competently

the blue

two trades he led ably the souls of three
hundred hectically religious parishioners of
the leventh avenue church and for this
he drew annually one hundred and fifty
dollars and mark the wording he drew
it like every man nobly possessed of a
great cause he put hie whole soul into his
preaching and he made it most effica-
cious

  if it be true that he put his whole soul
into his preaching it is likewise true that
he was a man with two souls-a dual per-
sonality-because he put his whole soul
too into his grocery business

  not to split hairs parson junius scipio
crackweather a portly gentleman of some
thirty-four years of age was a business
genius if he had been bom white and
dropped down in another environment
there would have been another name to be
added to the list of millionaires the
name of crackweather would have been
as familiar as the name of rockefeller
as it was he had done very well where fate
had put him the town was full of highly
respected white folks whom he could have
bought and sold

  in the world of colored people he was a
brainy man among children he had fig-
ured prominently as an official in all sorts
of benevolent charitable and financial so-
cieties and he had emerged from them all
with well-lined but inconspicuous pockets
he never talked about his money he never
flashed any of it so though calvin knew
by repeated hearsay evidence that he was
rich he had no idea of the real extent of
his wealth

  calvin didnt know either that parson
crackweather was seriously considering
the purchase of an automobile that he was
about to pause in his steady flow of acqui-
sition and spend something he didnt
know that the sun of generosity awakened
from its winter by a womans winsomeness
and desirability was shining upon the hith-
erto ungenerous heart of junius scipio and
that it had warmed that heart to the point
where the parson waited only the accumu-
lation of two hundred dollars more or so
before purchasing a real car

  calvin did know though that he wanted
the job badly and that hed have to hurry
if he beat george washington sparks to it

  he found parson crackweather behind
his counter arrayed not in the clerical
broadcloth but in the merchants apron
the parson was weighing out sugar for
mrs wickie-sugar and two unobtrusive
book magazine

black fingers that wouldnt mount up to
more than an extra ounce or two when
he had taken mrs wickies offering be
turned to calvin

ed calvin suspiciously

  his suspicions were confirmed  pren-

by alexander hull

tice explained crackweather is some-
body what is leamin the trade he aint

ptent to do the work same as a sperienced
clerk but soon as he is sperienced then
he gets regular wages same as anybody

benevolently but vaguely

weather

i eaving his employer calvin started
off down parker street at the fourth
house he paused with calm assurance he
knocked and the door was opened by a
good-looking young girl miss sally pina-
fer at the sight of calvin plummer a
broad delighted smile broke archly over her
features

  come right in miste plummer said
the dusky damsel cordially ise powful

  is yo got a gagement fo friday

  and calvin knowing he was caught per-
force shook his head

  nom miss pinafer i is free fo fri-
day evenin

  then i axes yo fo dinner that night
she said promptly

  yesm thank yo ill sho be heah
said calvin uneasily there was some-
thing in her eye that told him hed better
be if he wanted the pinafer trade well
it had to be of course she was a very
attractive girl much more charming than
caroline tobie but then she hadnt a
thousand dollars hed watch his step
pretty carefully an now he con-
cluded i speck ill have to be moseyin
long ise a powful busy man this aft-
noon

  he moved away in a troubled mood
miss pinafer liked him too well for his
peace of mind

  he knocked at the second door beyond
miss pinafers a very obese negress in
once-blue calico opened the door and stood
in it arms akimbo highly belligerent

  how-do mis graham said calvin
ingratiatingly i is come to axe yo ef

  majestically she stopped him geoge

mo yo triflin lazy ornery no-
count-

  calvin got

  the rebuff didnt particularly faze him
he had expected that it was enemy ter-
ritory the knowledge that george was
always just ahead of him however was
discomforting he redoubled his energy
and his persuasions by nightfall of the
second day he left pretty thoroughly con-
vinced that he had george well beaten

ime dragged three months passed

  by every reasonable arithmetical for-
mula calvin plummer should have passed
the seventeen-fifty mark long since he
had worked faithfullyfor three months and
should have had all sorts of money to show
for it but-he had precisely eleven dollars
and forty-three cents he and george were
running neck-and-neck for george had
twelve dollars and two cents georges oc-
casional stumblings into the pitfalls of
gambling hadnt cost him quite as much
as calvins more social mishaps

  calvin had fallen for a splendid green
felt hat for a pair of terribly tan shoes and
for three fine ties one lavender one pink
and one green confronted by fine feath-
ers all the steel in his nature melted in a
fiery pleasure in adornment he was more
elegant than he had ever been before

  then miss sally pinafer had cost him
quite a lot in a manner which ordinarily
he wouldnt have minded but which now
was distinctly depressing miss pinafer
was tireless in the consumption of pink ice-
cream she had a way of happening cas-
ually upon calvin in front of the perfec-
tion ice-cream parlor and of somehow
hypnotizing him inside where in rapid suc-
cession she would consume one two or even
three dishes of the confection and thus
keep him poor

  calvin was proving the truth of the in-
fallible formula the cost of living in-
creases directly with the income still
what could he do if he ditched the costly
miss sally in order to distance george he
lost his star customer the pinafers were
faithful they never bought anything dur-
ing georges week and he dared not
offend them because each bi-weekly ac-
counting had shown under the parsons
very able handling that it was still nip-
book magazine

and-tuck between the two prentices one
week george ran a dollar or two ahead
another calvin was in the lead

   the parson said he neve would of be-
 lieved theah was two colored boys nowhere
 what was so puffeckly matched he
 found it as yet utterly impossible to
 chose between them

   the parson had his car now the pres-
 ence of a prentice in the store made it oc-
 casionally possible for him to get out and
 practice running it he had gotten almost
 to the stage where timid folks were willing
 to take a chance with him

   of course neither george nor calvin was
 satisfied with the state of affairs one
 weeks work at regular clerks wages would
 have sent either of them over the top how
 to get that weeks regular wages was the
 question the parson was vastly con-
 scientious about it he would have been
 glad to make a decision he said if either
 of them had only distanced the other
 and he would consider he stated that a
 signal victory of that sort would certainly
 mark the victor as ready for promotion
 from the apprentice class

   as a last resort calvin earnestly con-
 sidered the removal of his rival by force
 but that too he gave up george was a
 husky man handy with his fists and with a
 knife as well it was too dangerous too
 doubtful

   finally he decided to consult lawyer
 bricker lawyer bricker upon the pre-
  sumption that this was professional advice
 charged calvin one dollar paid in advance
 and calvin poured out his woes

   an he say we dont know nough to be
 clerks yet he concluded he say we is
 got a lot to learn but bout the onliest
 thing we aint done is put the sand in the
 sugar an he always do that his ownsef
 i wants to ax you is we titled now to be
 reglar clerks or is we got to go on being
 prentices an ef you say we is titled to
 be clerks i is gwine to make that pason
 pusson come though

   the shyster lawyer sat in wrinkled
deeply cogitant silence for a moment-for
two moments-for five then he rose and
took down from his dusty shelf a large
and worn volume it was a latin lexicon
but it was also a mighty convincing volume
to any negro as lawyer bricker had had
ample cause to know his clients hada
great awe of that volume it had settled
a thousand disputes out of court he
turned the pages searching sharply with a

by alexander hull

 gnarled finger none too clean presently
 he grunted and pointed tf a line

  there he said i think that disposes
of your difficulty

  calvin eyed the finger and the page rev-
erently

  yassuh-yassuh he said sho does
-sho does and then doubtfully uh
-what does it say suh i isnt got my
specks with me

  it says replied lawyer bricker seri-
ously that you are entitled to full and
regular clerks pay if you can get it
yassuh-yassuh cried calvin delight-
edly that sho disposes of that pason
pusson dont it sho does-sho does
and he went out poor creature greatly
pleased with himself and lawyer bricker
and his information

cne problem remained then the elim-
    ination of george

  he found george also quite pleased by
the legal advice and willing within certain
limits to be reasonable about it george
had long ago arrived at calvins conclusion
-that so long as the parson had two of
them he never would raise their wages
only george had it fixed in his mind
somehow that the proper thing was for
calvin not himself to be eliminated it
appeared for some time to be a deadlock

  george thought and calvin thoughtr
they thought in unison and they thought
separately then they thought some more
finally it was the gambling instinct that
came to the solution

  i tells yo what said george theys
jes one way to decide this yeah dilemma
and thats the spotin way

  the spotin way

  uh-huh and george produced two
large yellow dice from his pocket

  um-m-m-i dont know bout that

 its the onliest way what they is in-
sisted george

  um-m-m calvin scratched his head
thoughtfully george was accustomed at
divers times to boast that his middle name
was bones or ivory there might be
something in it but then he reflected that
george had been trying for weeks to ex-
pand his scant wages by the gambling
method without any success ill luck had
loved george like a brother calvin bright-
ened up

  besides suppose he did lose one
thing about it calvin plummer was one
mighty tired darky-mighty tired work-

ing for parson crackweather and judge
green and mr holcomb and other cal-
loused drivers of men wasnt exactly a
sinecure not any sort of work was for
that matter the longer he thought about
the future the tireder he became and in
a minute or two even his present state
seemed unendurable no he felt that he
couldnt go on with it at any cost

  but if he won mrs tobie intended see-
ing that he stuck by the job

  oh well he might just possibly en-
dure sticking by it until he had coaxed
from her some of those fascinating dollars
once he had them let her divorce him
she was welcome

nevertheless three minutes later when
via the sporting route george washington
sparks won the job and the right to the
lady calvin plummer rose and went away
from that spot in a state of almost morbid
depression

  deep dejection flowed over his soul in
great and increasing waves gloom filled
the bright sunday morning air he was
a fool to have staked every thing upon
a throw of the dice a madman no less
jobless and bitter he passed down elev-
enth street uncomforted by his own spick-
and-span magnificence uncheered by the
ten dollars and forty-three cents in his
pocket for him truly no sun shone and
no bird sang for him no-

ood-monin miste plummer 
calvin glanced up and swept off his
hat with a melancholy grace

  monin miss pinafer

  miss pinafer giggled and gurgled deli-
ciously is yo heah the big news

calvin gloomily

  ise gwine to be bride-smaid said
miss pinafer with a long provocative
pause between the two syllables

  oh is yo said calvin indifferently
  uh-huh sho is laughed sally

  calvin had jumped at the name as if
pricked by a pin he stood now mouth
agape staring at sally pinafer like an
idiot suddenly his graven face became
mobile one emotion after another chased
across his features in the end wild mirth
won the steeplechase

  whoopee whoopee he howled

  sally stared at him a moment coldly

he was all lit up with the spectation of
bein the second husban of mis tobie
after a moment he began to look at miss
pinafer with an unprejudiced eye mrs
tobie being now inaccessible he could do
that miss pinafer was a mighty person-
able young woman following the lure of

of anything but work and trouble after

lemuel l
debra

we sat in a booth of the hang
far low my good friend
chan yin do and i munch-
ing shensi almonds and rice
cakes and sipping a most fragrant dragon-
beard tea from the street below the
main avenue of san franciscos china-
town came the weird strains of a chinese
orchestra and i knew that the funeral
procession the services of which we had
witnessed was passing when we could
no longer hear the discordant wail of the
flageolets nor the jarring clang of cymbals
chan yin do put his tiny bowl aside
smacked his lips with satisfaction and an-
swered the question i had put to him

  yes it is quite true that in some parts
of china it was once the custom to bury
sums of money with the dead and al-
though many of those tombs have been
looted by you foreigners there yet remains
much treasure in the old graves of the
middle kingdom

  i refilled our bowls with the steaming
dragonbeard and passed the cigarettes to
chan yin do

  why do you say all the looting was
done by foreigners i inquired politely
you know many of the younger chinese
have abandoned the superstitions of the
older generation i believe i read once
that in a certain province i have for-
gotten just where revolutionists planned

 

to finance their movement by robbing the
graves of that coin of the dead 

  chan yin do nodded and an odd look
came into his slant black eyes with a
long polished nail he flicked the ash from
his cigarette and as he raised his arm the
flowing sleeve of his satin blouse fell back
and disclosed a bracelet of finest yunnan
jade

  that would be very wicked and fool-
ish he said the money could not be
recovered without disturbing the bones of
the buried and as anyone knows great
misfortune would befall the one who did
such a sacrilegious act and what is still
worse evil spirits would pursue and bring
ill luck to the family of the one whose
bones were disturbed even though many
generations had intervened only when
the bones of ones ancestors lie in peace
can one have a propitious jung shui

  to this i made no reply we sat a
moment in silence

  still it has been done chan yin do
admitted finally once there was in san
francisco a young man of the family of
lee named wah sin who because he had
goge to an american school thought he
was very smart and that the older chinese
were very foolish one time he read in
your books about thejmcient custom of
burying money with the dead in china
and remembering how he had seen such
coin of the dead

things in his childhood he went back to
the middle kingdom to rob the graves
he thought he would very easily become a
wealthy man and he-he found-

  chan yin do hesitated i summoned a
waiter and directed him to fetch more tea
and cigarettes and while chan yin do
with noisy relish sipped at the steaming
tea i waited in silence i wanted to hear
what happened to lee wah sin when he
defied the religious beliefs of his people
and went back to his native land to steal
that coin of the dead

  presently chan yin do lighted another
cigarette then he began

i ee wah sin was the son of a fish-
monger whose stall was on clay street
and who was a very honest and industrious
merchant old lee wanted his son to
learn the fish and shrimp business which
is quite profitable when one knows how
to evade the foolish laws of the foreign
devils but the boy was very unfilial and
disobedient as are so many of the younger
generation

  my stomach rebels at the sight of your
filthy shop he told his father one day
when i see you coming home for evening
rice with a noisome gunny-sack about your
middle and fish-scales on your slippers and
a basket of fish-heads on your arm i am
ashamed to admit to my fine friends that
that smelly old man is my honorable
father

  but one must do something spoke
up his mother who hoped in her heart that
the boy would become almost anything
save a cleaner of fish and a sheller of
shrimps

  yes agreed lee wah sin that is quite
true so i shall go to an american school
and learn the wisdom of the fan quat and
then i shall earn money easily like old
soo hoo nam art who because his
stomach is big with wisdom does nothing
but cut pieces from the fan quai news-
papers and then write them in our lan-
guage for the chinese daily world

  old lee was very angry because of his
sons perverseness and he would have
given the boy a sound beating with bam-
boo which he richly deserved but the
boy was very strong and wilful and the
old father had lost his strength from much
opium-smoking and a strange disease
which many fish-cleaners get had attacked
his eyes and made him almost blind so
while old lee sputtered angrily wah sin

the blue

left the house and went whistling down the
street to play billiards

  one day when lee wah sin had learned
so much from the american books that he
had almost forgotten his thousand-word
classics and the other things his old
chinese tutor had taught him he picked
up a foreign-devil book that told about
chinese customs the writers of those
foolish books think our customs very
strange but as anyone should know they
are not strange at all lee wah sin
thought the book very amusing indeed for
he had come to think that he was very
smart and he laughed at the things the old
chinese do

 in the book he read how the old
chinese always have a geomancer select
the burial ground so that the evil spirits
will not molest the dead how we do not
build houses or go on journeys unless the
geomancers agree that the time is propi-
tious how we worship our ancestors who
have gone instead of giving all to the new
generation which is here and he read
about many other customs which my peo-
ple in the middle kingdom have followed
faithfully for four thousand years and
more but which you white foreign devils
because you are so young and hence very
ignorant think quite foolish

  and among those customs which lee
wah sin read about in the book was the
one of burying money with our dead it
reminded him as i have told you of how
when he was a child in the middle king-
dom he had often seen sums of money
placed on the altar with the ceremonial
meats and buried with the dead

  now instead of burying that money
with those who are dead and therefore
know nothing how much better if it were
given to thesyoung men and young women
for fine clothes reasoned lee wah sin
haie i wish i had some of it there
must be quite a fortune in those old burial
grounds there are many many millions
of people in the middle kingdom but
the number that walk the earth is but a
handful compared with the number of
those who lie in the ground if i could
get even a part of that spirit money that
lies with those crumbling bones i would
be very rich

  so in the days that followed lee wah
sin thought much about the money that
lay in the moldy graves of his ancestors
but he said nothing about the plan that
was taking shape in his scheming heart
book magazine



  it was several moons later that the great
opportunity came to lee wah sin an
american importing company wanted a
chinese youth with an english education
to go to canton for them to act as buyer
lee wah sin lacked much of having com-
pleted his education but he could speak
english with a very glib tongue he ob-
tained the position and sailed on the first
steamer

  he had been in canton only a month
when he asked permission to visit his
fathers people who lived in the interior
on the si-kiang to the west of canton his
employers did not like to let him go but
lee wah sin was very obstinate and on
that same day he obtained passage on a
ho-tau that was leaving for the up-river
villages

  since he thought he was a very shrewd
fellow lee wah sin dressed now like his
own people and he pretended to be one
of them although all the time he was
laughing at them and at their customs

in the months that had passed since lee

	wah sin first thought of going to china
to steal the money that had been buried
with the dead he had made a definite
plan he remembered that many years
before he had seen his fathers elder
brother laid away with the ceremonial
meats and quite a sum of money so
wah sin had planned to go first to their
native village and steal the money from
his uncles tomb if this venture proved
successful it would give him capital and
confidence to continue his undertaking

  if i find only a few strings of copper
cash in each grave i shall soon become
a rich man as riches go in china thought
lee wah sin to himself as he sat on the
deck of the ho-tau listening to the chant-
ing song of the boatmen

  thus it was that when lee wah sin
arrived at the village of the lees he sought
some one who could tell him of the family
of lee and so he came that morning to
my fathers house for the villagers told
him that at the house of chan he could
obtain food and lodging and could learn
about his own people my father was a
very old man and he remembered the
father of wah sin very well when he
learned that old lee had prospered in the
land of the white foreign devils and that
the son had a well-filled purse my father
took him in and charged him only a trifle
more than was the custom

by lemuel l debra

  so lee wah sin staid with us spending
his time wandering around the village and
into the fields he visited many of the
family of lee but he soon learned that
they were much more interested in the
money in his purse than in him

  then one day lee wah sin said to one
of the family of lee

  on the morrow i must begin my jour-
ney back to canton i have already told
you how i promised my honorable father
that i would visit the burial ground of the
lees and make sure that the sepulchre of
my fathers father and of my fathers elder
brother has not been disturbed by maraud-
ing hands so today i ask that you go
with me and point out the place where
lie the bones of my honorable uncle and
grandfather that i may keep the promise
i have given	 

  now the lees thought this a very gen-
erous and filial thing so for a small sum
one of them guided lee wah sin through
the pulse fields to the low rocky hills
where for many generations those of the
family of lee had been interred it was
a very propitious spot high and free from
dampness the graves were dug in the
sides of the soft rock and after the coffin
with the ceremonial meats and the spirit
money had been placed therein the open-
ing had been closed with rocks and sealed
with clay from the river lee wah sin
was veiy loud in his praises of the lees
for the way they had cared for the burial
ground of their ancestors but secretly
he was thinking how easy it would be to
find the place at night and to break into
the sepulchre of his uncle

  we thought nothing of it that evening
my father and i when lee wah sin as
was his custom went out shortly after
dark saying he would walk by the river
nor did we suspect anything unusual when
he returned somewhat late and went di-
rectly to bed without speaking to anyone
it was not until morning rice that we
knew something was wrong lee wah sin
did not arise and eat with us when my
father went to call him he found lee
wah sin still in bed very green in his
face and moaning with pain seeing that
one of lee wah sins arms was badly
swollei my father examined it the arm
was broken

  how did this happen lee wah sin
demanded my father why did you not
tell me last night

 i-i fell over the river-bank onto the
coin of the dead

rocks lee wah sin replied i did not
tell you because i was not sure it was
broken

  that was very foolish my father
scolded him surely you must have
known it was broken now the arm is
badly swollen and it will be much more
difficult to mend

  so my father sent me quickly to lung
nims to buy some leung-tsoy-suen tit-
dar yeuk tsau which as anyone knows
is a very wonderful remedy when ones
bones are broken and he called in old
doctor ng poon gee who since it was
seven oclock when he arrived gave lee
wah sin seven large pills and put seven
healing plasters on his broken arm i
heard my father and doctor ng poon gee
talking in low voices where lee wah sin
could not hear them they said something
i could not quite understand but it was
about the length of lee wah sins purse
and the length of time he would probably
be ill

instead of being well the next day lee

	wah sin was much worse he had a
very bad fever and he talked foolish
words and would not eat my father
shook his head and doctor ng poon gee
shook his head and they agreed that lee
wah sin must have done something very
wicked indeed

  then one day when lee wah sin had
been sick a long time although his fever
had been cured with a medicine my father
made of two kinds of serpents a buffalos
foot ginseng and rice spirits a lee man
came to our door and asked for my father
i remember the lee man spoke very
angrily

  aih-yak bad luck has fallen upon the
family of lee the riverbank on which
we have had our hog-house for many sea-
sons has caved in and we have lost three
hogs a strange disease has attacked our
ducks and nine have already died at
the same time a son was bom to one of
the wives of lee gow but although the
child was taken quickly to the river and
washed an evil spirit stopped its nostrils
and the child died

  ts ts what misfortune sympa-
thized my father have you made the
propitiatory offerings

  we have replied the lee man but
as you very well know such misfortunes
could come only from a bad fung-shm
so we sent one of the family of lee to our

the blue

burial ground to see if perchance water
which mildews the bones had seeped into
the graves or what would be much worse
to learn if any enemy had disturbed the
bones of our ancestors

  haie that would be a terrible thing
exclaimed my father drawing away from
the lee manand looking about him fear-
fully what did you find

  we found cried the lee man fiercely
that some one has broken into a sepulchre
of the lees and scattered the bones it
must have been done at night for the
opening had been very poorly closed as
though the one who did it worked in dark-
ness now as you very well know dis-
tinguished and venerable chan there is no
one in the village who would do such a
wicked thing we believe it was done by
our cousin lee wah sin who has for-
gotten the good his father taught him and
remembers only the evil he has learned in
the land of the white foreign devils only
a few days ago lee wah sin had lee
gums boy show him the way to the very
grave that has been disturbed we know
that lee wah sin was staying under your
roof but we have heard that he has not
been seen for several days is not his
flight sufficient proof of his guilt so i
have come to you honorable chan to
ask if you know whence lee wah sin has
fled

  when the lee man had finished speak-
ing my father as was his custom smoked
a pipe in silence then blowing the ashes
from the bowl he shook his head sadly
and clicked his tongue

  ts ts what misfortune he ex-
claimed i am very sorry for you but
i do not know if i can help you perhaps
by tomorrow this time i may have news
for you yes on reflection i am sure
that if i had a few handfuls of cash to
hire errand boys i could have some very
good gossip for you tomorrow

  so the lee man gave my father the
money and when the lee man had gone
i said

  honorable father i wish you would
permit me to earn a few of those cash
and if you need another errand boy i
could get wong sam for you

  my father frowned at me you are
very stupid yin do he said

  then he put the whole of the cask into
his own purse and went into the room
where lay lee wah sin wondering why
my father had thought me stupid i sat
book magazine



down close by the door and listened and
almost at once i heard lee wah sin ex-
claim

  oh distinguished and excellent chan
surely your liver is large with benevolence

i heard what the lee man said and i
know how you have protected me but
sir it is true all true what the lee man
said i have had much time to meditate
while lying here and i know now that i
have been very foolish and wicked what
can i do sir how can i escape the
righteous wrath of the lees

  my father was silent a long time i
could hear the sputtering of his long pipe
and i could hear him blowing the ashes
from the bowl

  it is a very difficult matter he said
at length perhaps i can help you but
first tell me why did you do this terrible
thing

  then lee wah sin told my father the
whole story as i have told it to you he
told my father how he had read in the
book of the spirit money that lay in the
graves of china and how he had planned
to rob those graves

co i went back that night to the grave
of my fathers elder brother said lee
wah sin and with a stout spade i opened
the sepulchre with my flashlight which
i brought with me from san francisco i
searched around the coffin on the rocky
floor but i could not find the money i
sought then finally i turned the coffin
over and there i saw many coins

  i gathered the coins and put them in a
bag i had brought for the purpose and
as i gathered them i thought what a fool-
ish custom it is to bury money with the
dead and what a foolish belief it is that
any harm will come of taking that spirit
money

  i was still picking up coins when a
strange thing happened my flashlight for
no reason that i knew went out

  and then while i knelt there in the
darkness i heard the rattle of a stone out-
side the grave thinking that some one
had discovered me i hastened out it was
very bright with starlight there was no
sound there was nothing that i could see
that could have caused that stone to move

  but that was not all as i looked down
at the willows by the river-bank i saw a
most terrible sight and i heard a fearful
sound those willows honorable chan
were tossing and swaying and i heard a

by lemuel l debra

noise like the sobbing and moaning of win-
ter winds through dead branches yet
there was no wind

  i began to feel very strange and my
stomach grew cold it seemed that the air
all about me was moving with the angry
spirits of the lees i looked back into that
dark grave and a great fear took hold of
me i dared not enter that sepulchre
again

  so i hastily covered the opening then
with the spade in one hand and the sack
of spirit money in the other i walked my
way in great haste and in fear there
were noises all about me yet i could see
no one the tall grass of the foot-hills
billowed like an angry sea yet there was
no wind

  i started to run and it was then i
fell i stumbled yet the path was smooth
and there was no reason why i should have
stumbled and i fell over the river-bank
to the rocks below i knew my arm was
broken but i was afraid to tell you

  yes i have been very foolish and
wicked concluded lee wah sin while
the fever was on me i had visions of the
wrong i have done the old chinese are
right the bones of ones ancestors must
not be disturbed it is because i have
done this wicked thing that misfortune has
fallen upon the lees it is because of my
evil deed that i have been lying here ill
ihave been punished and it is proper that
i should have been punished so i ask
you venerable chan what can i do if
the lee men find me here they will surely
slay me

  i was very glad when lee wah sin fin-
ished his story for it seemed that the room
had become very cold and dark and i was
trembling with fear while i debated
whether to run from the house into the
sunshine my father spoke

  ts ts what a wicked thing you have
done yes the lee men will surely slay
you that is the law and it is right

  there was silence then for about the
time it takes to drink a cup of tea then
my father said	

  it would help some perhaps if the
spirit money could be restored to the
grave of the lee man

  ah i have it all here spoke up lee
wah sin eagerly it is all here in this
bag by the grass-seed pillow i have not
touched it i have not even dared to look
at it could you sir scholar take it back
for me
coin of the dead

the blue

  it would be very dangerous my father
objected a lee man might observe me
and think that i was the one who had
stolen the money besides the spirits
would be angry with me if i even so much
as touched the string that binds the sack
yes that is true but i will pay you
well i will pay you anything you ask
hate i could not accept money for
such a thing exclaimed my father
haughtily it would be sacrilegious
still on reflection i think there would be
no harm in giving me a sum of money to
buy offerings for i shall have to propitiate
the spirits

  i will do that gladly

  then it would be well to give the lees
a good present of money so they can re-
build the hog-house that has fallen buy
more hogs and ducks and pay the expenses
of burying the child that died

  i will do that too sir agreed lee
wah sin how much would you sug-
gest

  my father meditated a moment

  count what money you have he said
finally first pay me what is owing for
your keep then set aside enough for your
passage back to canton divide the re-
mainder into two parts one-half for the
lees and the other half to be used by me
in making sacrifices

ir a time lee wah sin did not an-

	swer then he spoke very quietly
bat honorable chan that will leave me
nothing

  you will need nothing you will be
in canton where you have a good posi-
tion

  alas cried lee wah sin i no longer
have even a position i told my employ-
ers that i might engage in other business
and that if i did not return at a specified
time they could secure some one in my
place the appointed time for my return
has passed while i lay here ill

  well you will at least have your life
and that is more than you will have if the
lees discover you on reflection i am
half a mind to turn you over to the lees
for by helping you i anj incurring the
anger of the gods and there is no profit
in it for me

  oh i will pay i will pay cried lee
wah sin do not turn me over to the
lee men

  then it is settled said my father a
ho-tau leaves at sunrise for canton i will

hide you in the rice fields below the vil-
lage and when the ho-tau passes you can
swim out and go aboard now count out
the money as i have directed for the
longer you wait the angrier the spirits will
be

  so lee wah sin took his purse and
divided the money as my father had told
him then my father said

  now give me what is owing me for
your keep and lee wah sin gave it to
him then my father said

  now of the remainder give me the
half that i am to use in making propitia-
tory offerings for the sin you have done
and this also was given to my father
then my father said

  now give me the other half that i may
send it at once to the lees before they
learn you are here and take both your life
and your money and this lee wah sin
did also thanking my father for his gener-
ous help and wise counsel

  now said my father since i have the
money in hand with which to buy the sac-
rificial offerings the spirits know of my
good intentions therefore you may now
give me the bag of money you took from
the grave of your fathers elder brother
lee wah sin lost no time in taking the
bag from beneath the grass-seed pillow and
handing it to my father

  for a time neither made speech and i
heard only the sputtering of my fathers
pipe and the hissing of his breath as he
blew the ashes from the bowl then at
length he spoke and i thought his talk
was very strange and startling

  haie he chuckled you are indeed a
fool lee wah sin your head is as empty
as your purse you have a little learning
but you have not learned enough you
were right about the money buried in our
graves and yet you were wrong what
do you think is the value of this money you
found beneath the bones of your uncle
why i did not take time to count it
replied lee wah sin but there are sev-
eral silver coins in addition to many copper
cash i would say the value is at least five
thousand cash

  my father laughed uproariously he
shook the bag of jingling coins

  it is worth about two hundred cash
lee wah sin uttered a great cry and he
spoke words that were very strange to me
although i have since heard foreign devil
teamsters use the same words in speaking
to their lazy horses
book magazine

i

  let me explain said my father it is
true that we used to bury sums of good
money with the bodies of our dead but
one time the word went about from village
to village that there was to be a revolu-
tion and that the revolution was to be
financed by opening the graves and recov-
ering this spirit money whereupon the
people reasoned that to have the graves of
their ancestors profaned and to be robbed
at the same time was too much so they
went quickly to all the graves and recov-
ered the money themselves then they
went to the gold and silver merchants and
had worthless pieces of metal struck off in
imitation of the real money and they put
these worthless counterfeits in the graves
since then they use these imitations a
whole sack of which costs no more than
two hundred copper cash in some places
they use merely little round pieces of
paper it is all the same to the spirits
of the dead

  so lee wah sin you see now why you
are a fool the money that was buried
with your uncle was long ago recovered by
the lees all you got is this bag of worth-
less metal and again my father laughed
and shook the jingling sack

  a fterward i learned that when my
mather finished speaking lee wah sin
looked at him a long time then with a
groan like that of one who is dying or
wishes to die lee wah sin turned his face
to the wall

  presently my father came out i remem-
ber he carried in one hand the good money
lee wah sin had given him and in the
other hand he had the sack of spirit
money which lee wah sin had stolen i
saw him put the good money into a bag and
hide it in his blouse then he looked long
and thoughtfully at the sack of spirit
money which he had placed on the table

  i saw my father reach out a hand to
take hold of the string that was around the
neck of the sack i saw him suddenly
draw back his hand and i heard his breath
hiss between his lips then after awhile
he seized the cords in his trembling hands
and untied the bag and as he peered into
the sack a startled look came over his
face and his hands shook so that the sack
slipped from his fingers and fell jingling
to the table

  the room it seemed to me had again
become very dark and cold and i was
trembling with fear for i knew my father

by lemuel l debra

had done a very profane and dangerous
thing i turned and fled out of the house
into the sunshine by the bamboo fence

  i was there by the fence wondering at
the things i had seen and heard when my
father came to me and said

  go quickly with these two hundred
cash to gow li tell him i desire to
purchase spirit money with the whole
sum

  so i did as my father told me

  the next day when the lee man called
my father said

  i find that what you have told me re-
garding lee wah sin is correct he has
gone he did not go at the time you
thought but that has nothing to do with
the matter he left my house at night
and hid in the rice fields below the village
until morning when he swam out and
boarded a ho-tau for canton

  then venerable chan we can do noth-
ing cried the lee man

  it is a foolish man who is hasty in
speech retorted my father listen well
to what i have to tell you before he
left lee wah sin gave a bag of money to
my keeping undoubtedly he repented of
his sin and desired to make amends to-
night go to the grave that has been dis-
turbed do not take a light but in dark-
ness cast this spirit money into the
sepulchre of the lee man whose bones have
been molested then quickly close the
grave and seal it if you do faithfully
what i have said your jung shut will be-
come propitious and the evil spirits will
no longer pursue the family of lee

  then while the lee man could not
speak for joy my father took from beneath
his blouse a sack of jingling coins and the
lee man thanked my father in a loud

voice and walked his way in haste 

  i spoke up quickly

  honorable father you have made a
grievous mistake you did not give the
lee man the sack of spirit money that
lee wah sin took from his uncles grave
you gave him the one i bought of gow li
for the two hundred copper cash

  my father jumped he turned quickly
and closed the door

  haie you are a fool he cried fiercely
hold your tongue until you have learned
wisdom and he scowled at me so hor-
ribly that i said no more knowing that i
must be very stupidindeed for of a
truth i was about to tell my father also
that he had forgotten to give the lee man
coin of the dead

the money lee wah sin had left to pay lor
the hoghouse that fell the hogs and ducks
that were lost and the expense of burying
the child that died because of lee wah
sins wicked deed

  my father went to his great bamboo
chair by the table and sat down from
his stocking he took his long tasseled pipe
and for a time there was silence save foe
the sputtering of the pipe and the hissing
of my fathers breath as he blew the ashes
from the bowl finally he spoke to me
more kindly

  my son i perceive that you are ob-
servant that is an excellent trait if i
had not been observant i would not have
noticed that the sack of spirit money
which lee wah sin took from the grave
of his uncle was all good money that was
true what i told him about the people re-
covering the good money that had been
buried with the dead but i recalled after-
ward that the lees used to quarrel about
that very thing accusing one of not bring-
ing back all the money they were sure had
been put in the grave of a lee lee wah
sin being more greedy than religious
searched more carefully and found a sack
of good money worth perhaps five thousand
cash since the lees have forgotten all
about the money i can keep it without
any loss to them

  observe then how it is more profitable
to do good than to do evil  my father con-
cluded i could have given lee wah sin

by lemuel l debra

over to the lee family and they would
have slain him and would have divided his
money amongst themselves which would
have been of little benefit to them because
there are so many lees so i chose to do
good i restored the jung shui of the lees
i saved the life of lee wah sin and out
of it i have made a nice profit

a gain i refilled our bowls with the
    steaming dragonbeard

  and lee wah sin i inquired what
became of him

  chan yin do looked at me and i was
sure i saw a smile lurking in the depths of
his long black eyes

  haie he exclaimed softly that was
a very good lesson for lee wah sin he
fled from china and returned to san fran-
cisco as soon as possible he found that
during his absence his father had died
since lee wah sin had given up his school-
ing before it could be of any real use to
him he took over his fathers fish market
he is a very old man now and they speak
of him as one who observes faithfully all
the old chinese customs if you should
stand by the restaurant of the fragrant
flower near the hour of evening rice you
will see an old man come slowly up clay
street he wears a noisome gunny-sack
about his middle there are fish-scales on
his slippers and a basket of smelly fish-
heads on his arm that my son is lee

there is always a gentle wind
that blows through the divide
just at the fall of darkness it
conies from the snowfields but
whither it goes and where it dies no gov-
ernment weathermen have ever taken the
trouble to determine it does various
things as it goes along-pausing here and
there to wag the tops of the pine trees
like great semaphore signals to one an-
other brings certain smells and other mes-
sages t the senses of the wild creatures
and plays a curious song in the reeds of
the rivers edge on this particular eve-
ning amos hardman felt that it would
also bring in the cold

  but the man didnt particularly care
it was true that as yet he had built no
cabin on his recently acquired farm on the
upper umpqua but he had a tent on
the very shore of the river and as all
campers know a tent can be made snug
and warm in the worst of weather there
were plenty of warm blankets and there
was more firewood on the hills about than
any man would care to attempt to measure
in a lifetime in fact there were hundreds
of miles of nothing but firewood for one
of the greatest timber belts in the world
sweeps on either side of the umpqua river
of oregon

  he would have no cause to fear the chill
nightthat was sure to follow it would

probably be the first frost of the fall
leaves in a moment struck yellow and red
falling acorns and the first glint of the
wings of the waterfowl-this was what
frost meant to the high plateaus it meant
even more personal things to amos hard-
man he wondered if his cattle would
suffer on the range and if his growing
things would be killed he busied him-
self about the little farmyard

  the chickens were going to roost and
methodically amos hardman counted
them there had been a full dozen when
they had mounted to their perches the pre-
vious evening now there were just eleven
he called into the growing shadows

  just a moment he stood in thought then
he turned one hundred yards up the river
on the green bank he found what he was
looking for-a little telltale bunch of feath-
ers and curious dark spots on the herbage
the angry furrows grew in the mans face
as he bent to examine them

  with the care of a detective he looked
at the tracks in the soft dirt he was
naturalist enough to identify them at once
a mink he said to himself the low-
lived little critterl 

  it was all very plain a mink-one of
those bloodthirsty little slayers that have
hunting-grounds on the waterways-had
made short work of one of his pullets it
was the loss of a few cents and it was even
little death	the blue



a greater blow to his feelings amos shook
his fist at the river

  hang you ill get you for that if it
takes all winter he cried you little
bandit-youll die for it yet what a mink
was ever created for is a mystery to me
anyway-the most worthless useless no-
good thief in the world

  he turned swiftly back to his tent and
obtained his shotgun then looked up and
down the shore he thought he might
catch sight of the robber the shadows
grew and deepened and soon it became
plain that even hardmans keen eyes could
no longer detect a minks body in the reeds
he turned up the hill for a final effort in
a field that lay nearly a mile from his
riverside tent

  most worthless critter in the world he
said to himself as he started off into the
shadows no use to anything or anyone
on earth

dut although amos hardman had eyes
trained to the distances of the hills
there were many things indeed that he
could not see he had lived many years
among the wild things of the forest he
was a kindly man as mountaineers go and
not swift to condemn yet there were ex-
istences in the forest about him the mo-
tives and missions of which he could not
grasp no man ever lived long enough to
understand all the mysteries of the wil-
derness and perhaps even little death the
mink had his place in the scheme of
things

  for there is a curious balance in nature
it seems to be the plan of nature that no
one species may be allowed to overrun the
earth the ideal seems to be a world lit-
erally teeming with all forms of life and
that means that a certain number of foes
must be created for every living form to
keep the numbers of each in check the
stately cougar and the larger beasts of
prey are too proud to devote much of their
time and energies to the rodents and fowl
and such small people and nature soon
saw the need of a new breed of meat-eaters
to take care of them so she evolved a
whole family of small-sized wiry cour-
ageous hunters and identified them with a
little gland of astonishingly potent musk
in the body of each

  the weasels the ferrets the otters the
martens-even the despised mink was a
member of this family if amos hardman
had thought about this fact perhaps he

wouldnt have been so quick to condemn its
existence as useless and purposeless there
were many things indeed he didnt know
about little death otherwise his tone
might have been different he didnt know
of the hundreds of rodents each destructive
to his crops that the mink took care of
every year and like all men he couldnt
see the unfolding of events

  if he had been able to perhaps a mo-
ments understanding of the mysteries of
existence might have come to him he
would have known that every living crea-
ture has its mission and its place from the
buzzards that follow the dead to old woof
the bear grunting in the thickets some
were created to keep the numbers of some
other breed in check some were to clear
the ground of certain fast-spreading plants
but the missions of many of them are too
obscure for the eyes of men to see

  hardman didnt think about these things
as he climbed the hill he only thought
about the growing chill in the air and be-
cause he was only human he listened to
the stir of the waking forest life about
him

i ittle death was clever at many
- things but most of all he surpassed in
keeping out of sight it was the first les-
son his mother taught him long ago in
the grass nest beside the river never
show yourself till just before the leap
the old she-mink had said and perhaps
anticipating even then the rapture of rip-
ping out a jugular vein with his ivory teeth
his wicked little eyes had glowed like two
rubies in the velvet fur for the leap of a
mink is as swift as savage a thing as is
to be seen in all the savage wilderness and
usually there is death at the snd of it
once to see it is to understand how the
little slayer won his name

  the same rule held when little death
was the hunted rather than the hunter
to lie still like a little strip of brown mud
between the reed-stalks until it became
perfectly certain that his enemy had seen
him and flight was the only course for
little death had many enemies millions
of women all over the broad earth offered
much gold for his soft coat there were
traps in plenty all along the upper unp-
qua there were the greater beasts of prey
and the wide-winged marsh-owls had un-
pleasant habits of slipping up behind him
when least expected these great birds
had wings that were silence itself claws
book magazine

that were sharp and deadly and many
fledglings always hungry for the flesh of
the little people of the river even before
he had left the nest little death had had
nightmares of the two blue eyes in the
twilight

  there were not many human wayfarers
along the upper umpqua but such as
there were rarely caught sight of him and
this speaks well for the little bandits abil-
ity to conceal himself the few trappers
and hunters that came along were men of
rather exceptional powers of vision mostly
they were lank dark mountaineers who
didnt miss much of what was going on
about them though there is no more de-
ceitful jade in the world than mother na-
ture always pretending that her living
creatures are just patches of light and
shadow most of these mountaineers had
long since learned her wiles if a tender-
foot should pass within five paces of little
deaths body and fail to see him it would
be nothing at all to wonder at but when
amos hardman he who had lived forty
years on the divide did just this thing it
was something fer the forest people to talk
about one can even imagine a wise old
kingfisher blue-coated policeman who had
a beat on a certain ripple of the umpqua
squawking out this bit of scandal to old
woof the bear catching crawfish on the
shore and the furry old fellow sitting back
on his tailless haunche and grunting with
laughter

dut it was true that ordinarily human
beings completely failed to see the lit-
tle people of the river of course no one
could fail to notice woof and dull are the
eyes that are not filled with delight at the
sight of the black-tail deer drinking at the
waters edge when whisperfoot the cou-
gar cared to show himself at all no man in
his right senses cared to look the other
way and the glory of the elk is a name
the little people however went mostly
unobserved they were physically small
their coloration was highly protective but
most of all they were wary and elusive as
so many little shadows some of them
were not mammals at all the great trout
for instance that waved lazy tails at the
still bottoms of the deep pools farther
down the river a pair of beavers made en-
gineering plans through the long night and
the blue heron told a pair of little ruddy
ducks flirting their tails in a certain shal-
low that the last of the otters had estab-

by edison marshall



lished himself at the neck of an old slough
but they all were crafty and furtive and
shy beyond all telling and most of them
like little death himself did most of their
hunting either -in the eery hours of twilight
or at night

  this particular twilight he came creep-
ing forth from a little bunch of tall reeds
on the river bank no one could have
guessed one minute since that the few
yellow stalks would have made such a per-
fect hiding place the hour was late the
light was dim yet one little moment of
close scrutiny would have sufficed to com-
pletely change ones opinion about little
death in a moment one would cease to
think of him as an insignificant little rat
of the river and would know him for what
he was-a hunter and a killer more blood-
thirsty than a tiger more cunning than a
fox more savage than a wolf

  he was little death the mink less in
size than a rabbit but as fierce and terri-
ble a hunter as is known in the whole wil-
derness world his little red eyes burned
with a wicked light as he took the trail

 ature has been trying a long time to
 secure efficiency in her various crea-
tures she has always been improving her
types and her methods have been sure but
exceedingly deadly it was just a simple
proposition of killing off by process of the
survival of the fittest all the less efficient
and incapable creatures she has made
mistakes but few of them remain to clut-
ter up the earth and once or twice she
has achieved a positive masterpiece

  the little animal that serpent-like came
slipping out upon the game-trail beside the
river was really nothing less than a mas-
terpiece of nature no one could doubt
it to see him in action it isnt known
that nature had any efficiency expert to
help her out but naturalists do know that
this little beast of prey in his own sphere
is as capable effective and withal as
deadly a hunter as ever followed a trail
he is just as effective in a tree as on the
ground though this fact isnt relished at all
by the feathered people that make nests
in the branches he is agile fleet beyond
belief and ferocious up to his last breath

  as he came out from his hiding-place he
didnt lpake a false motion no hare could
have moved through the reeds more swiftly
than he he really didnt have any limits
he could dart up a tree as quickly as a
squirrel he could slip into a rabbit bur-
 little death

row or a hollow tree with the ease of a
ferret if he wished he could range far
from his native waters and keep equally
tvell fed and even the great lake trout in
the pool were no more at home in the dim
ljaths of the river bottoms than he

   scientists can tell about his teeth-how
perfectly they are arranged and sharpened
for a life of rapine there have been trap-
pers now and then who have carelessly
gotten their hands in range of these same
teeth-and thereafter have ever poken
softly every time the name of little death
oas been mentioned the jaws are manip-
ulated with tremendous bunches of muscles
the eyes miss little of what is going on
about him the nose is keen and a thrown
blade could scarcely equal the speed of
his leap many and strange are the stories
of his ferocity his deathless courage and
curiously most of them are true

   a rabbit had bounded along the river
bank earlier in the evening and little
death had found his trail just for an
instant he stood up on his haunches like a
squirrel and if the light had been better
one could have seen a transformation in
the fierce face and body he seemed to
grow more furtive the lips drew back
revealing a gleam of polished ivory but
the most pronounced change of all was in
his eyes

   they suddenly became little points of
reddish flame little deaths blood was
up the rabbit was still far off but the
blood-madness had already come upon him
all flesh-eaters know this passion-a lust
to heat the blood and ignite the brain-
but in none of them is it more pronounced
than in little death and his fellows a
tiger for instance will often linger over
its wounded prey for long hours it will
administer terrible caresses with claws and
fangs but this cold cruelty is unknown in
the mink his passion is too great for
that all he knows is to slay and slay
quickly with white teeth at the throat
then leap to another victim

i ittle death stood shivering with
l the fury and the madness upon him
then he started stealing down the river
but all at once he halted and whipped
about on his hind legs no human eyes
could follow that motion for an instant
he crouched utterly motionless and his
red fiery eyes searched the deepening
shadows he wasnt sure but it seemed to
him that a deeper shadow had flitted across

the blue

his trail all his life little death had
known this same curious darkening across
his path he had wakened from his dreams
in the reeds in horror of it it was made
by only one thing-the swift passage of
wings

  little deaths eyes were keen yet he
could see no longer perhaps forty yards
distant a shadow swept across a single
bright star that had pushed through the
twilight sky but it was too dark and
far away for even a mink to see plainly
and so intent was he upon the trail that
he was willing to disregard it

   and disregarding this particular shadow
was one thing his mother had told him
every time the dark came down that he
must not do it was the deadliest of all
the many deadly mistakes a mink can
make for that shadow often means the
presence of velvet wings the great homed-
owl that is terror itself to all the little
people velvet wings can come like a
cloud and his talons are death his voice
alone in the silence is enough to strike
terror into all the little folk within hearing
but the silence grew and deepened about
little death and he kept to the trail

  by now the darkness was growing over
the lake region the pines still stood in
curious silhouette against the western sky
but the outline of even the close tree-
trunks was blurred and indistinct the
river gleamed ever so softly the reeds
began their night song that curious rustle
they make as the wind plays over them a
sound that lingers long in the memory
all the forest world was wakening

  it was the hunting hour and little
deaths passion grew upon him there
seemed to be something in the air a fever
and excitement that the night wind had
brought on he didnt know it but farther
up the slope whisperfoot the cougar was
stalking his buck there was no particular
way in which little death could know it
because cat-tail feathers falling on the
reeds make more sound than whisperfoot
at his hunting moreover he is tawny
and hard to see in the shadows if he had
known the mink might have been more
wary the great cat does not ordinarily
attack such small game as minks but like
most other forest creatures his habits are
not entirely known and never to be trusted

and there was one other stirring crea-
 ture in the same little forest patch
back of hardmans tent he was hunting
 book magazine



 too but not for food the lowering night
 had brought the cold and the breed to
 which cold eye belonged was particularly
 susceptible to the lowering of the tempera-
 ture cold eye was looking for a warm
 place to lie through the night and must
 make haste

    he seemed to move with strange stealth
 scarcely a leaf rustling under him not
 even his eyes were visible in the shadows
 he crept lower down toward hardmans
 tent

    but the man was still on the hills and
 didnt see cold eye come for certain
 very good reasons hardman would have
 taken no joy in this visitation for cold
 eye was known far through the forests a
 creeper in the dust and a seeker of warm
 places in the cold nights he was the great
 gray rattlesnake that had lain all day on
 the ledge he was old the poison glands
 in his head were full and the forest crea-
 tures scampered off the trail to get out of
 his way

    he was angry because the deepening cold
 had driven him from his ledge and his
 savagery had grown upon him as he pro-
 gressed down the trail he didnt under-
 stand the gray wall that now had reared
 in front of him he slipped slowly un-
 der it

    hardman was a mountaineer brawn and
 bone and his bed was a pallet of boughs
 spread on the ground at the mouth of the
 tent his blankets two pairs of them were
 spread on top and at first cold eye did
 not understand them

    but slowly he slipped into them into
 the warmth and the darkness slowly he
 coiled till at last only a gray circle deadly
 past all things remained he would sleep
 here through the night he thought he
 would strike with deadly fangs any one
 that came to disturb him only his head
 was exposed

   on the hill above amos hardman had
 finished his work it had been a hard day
 and he was tired he thought with pleas-
 ure how he would swiftly remove his boots
 and trousers and leap between the blan-
 kets

    he would sleep well he thought at least
  if that worthless existence the mink did
  not revisit his hen-roost during the night
  yes he would sleep well for cold eye
  would be waiting with bared fangs for any
  one who would contest the bed with him

 and all things slept well after cold eye
 bad spoken to them

by edison marshall

the darkness had fallen by now but
the moon was up otherwise it would
have been too dark for even little death
to hunt it made a curious patchwork of
light and shadow on the trail it worked
strange miracles with the many ripples and
waterfalls of the river changing them seem-
ingly to wondrous works in silver it glinted
on the tops of the pines the rabbit trail
circled back and little death had made
the circuit when the shadow fell again but
it was behind him and he didnt see it
neither did he see the two circles of blue
fire that for an instant burned at him out
of the shadows the trail was growing
hot and the only emotion he had left was
anticipation of the killing that was to come
he had quite forgotten that velvet wings
also kept watch over this same hunting-
ground otherwise he wouldnt have sped
forward so gaily

  once more he paused to listen to a long-
drawn howl from the thickets at one side
it was a curious angry disappointed sound
and if little deaths intellect had been just
a little greater he might have understood
whisperfoot had missed his stroke his
paw had whipped down a fraction of a sec-
ond too late and the buck was a streak
in the darkness by now this was never
soothing to whisperfoots disposition he
was angry and he didnt care who knew
it the sound chopped squarely off in the
middle

  but if little death hacl known the little
drama that immediately followed he would
have been really vitally interested just
in the last notes of his howl a shadow had
suddenly leaped across whisperfoots nose
it is an old saying in the forest that a
cougar has always one jump left in him
whisperfoot had just that one jump and
he gave it fast as light it wasnt very
big game it was just a rabbit speeding
in stark terror up the -slope but it had
come too suddenly and was gone too quick
for even the cougars lightning blow to
overtake it the long meat-hook talons
dug into the earth a half inch behind the
little white tail

  whisperfoot started to howl again but
abruptly bethought himself better of it
he had an idea it seems to be true that
no animal excepting man can really rea-
son thus whisperfoots curious behavior
can hardly be ascribed to actual reasoning
and foresight perhaps it was simply an
inspiration-instinct developed in that cu-
rious phrasing of which no one exactly
little death

the blue

knows the meaning to the nth degree
whisperfoot simply seemed to know that
in just a moment some beast of prey would
come darting along that way on the rab-
bits trail

  he didnt know just what kind of beast
it might be he didnt care he was
sufficiently strong and large to master any
other flesh-eater of the oregon forest un-
less by a liberal interpretation one would
call woof a flesh-eater were it a fisher
or a wild-cat er even a wolf whisperfoot
need not be afraid and woof the bear
would n more attempt to catch a rabbit
than he would try to bite off his own
diminutive tail he was quite a foolish
old bear at times especially when the love-
sickness was on him in the fall but he had
never been that foolish

  the idea had no more than occurred to
whisperfoot and his muscles had set be-
cause in animals there is no time lost be-
tween an idea and its muscular response
than he knew he had guessed the truth
little feet came scratching along in the
dead leaves they were coming swiftly
and indeed they were very little but
whisperfoot had missed his stroke and
anything in the way of flesh was accepta-
ble

  and if the bright eyes of velvet wings
were watching from the sky perhaps the
great ewl thought he was to be cheated
after all he came winging down the trail
but a short distance ahead of amos hard-
man on the way to his tent and his bed

i ittle death was running straight
 into the cougars ambush whisper-
foot would not miss this time he would
gauge his stroke correctly and except
for one little prank of the forest gods-
those spirits whose sport it is to watch the
everchanging drama of the wilderness-
little death would have known no further
adventures that night whisperfoot was
crouched in the shadow but the moonlight
probed through and reflected in his eyes

  just for an instant they flashed like sin-
gular blue electric bulbs two circles close
together in the darkness the eyes of the
mink were red with passion and blood lust
-for he was hot upon the rabbits trail-
but they were not so blinded that he did
not discern the warning since his ear-
liest kittenhood he had known about the
two blue danger signals in the darkness

  it was not that he had ever encountered
whisperfoot before rather it was just a

matter of instinct an instinct all living
creatures possess that such twin moons
mean danger the eyes of velvet wings
himself had these same surface lights and
that fact alone was enough to draw the
mink up short in his tracks

  if he had raced on twelve more inches
he would have never got past the ambush
alive if he had stopped in his tracks for
one half of a breath whisperfoot would
have reached out a barbed paw and
snatched away his life but he did neither
of these things whisperfoot struck but
before the paw landed little death had
leaped aside if he surpassed at nothing
else he knew how to dodge and his mus-
cles were chain lightning itself whisper-
foot struck with his other paw and little
death dodged again

  the rabbit was at once forgotten lit-
tle death was dodging for his life twice
more the claws came down within an inch
of his furry body and by now whisperfoot
was striking all about him and he would
have suggested to woofs grim sense of
humor a human being vainly striking at a
mosquito then little death gathered
himself for a great spring and leaped full
over whisperfoots low-hung head then
he darted away through the tall grass

  whisperfoot chased him striking at him
again and again but always when the paw
came down little death was elsewhere
the mink cut back made a swift circle
and a moment more was at the river bank
the cougar understood these tactics once
more he leaped at the brown serpent in the
air and except for the luckiest chance
would have fallen into the river and that
would have given the forest people some-
thing to laughabout for a half-dozen moons

  little death struck the water with a
splash and was immediately out of his
sight it was his own element his claws
were semi-webbed and he took the ripples
like a salmon the chase had lost its
terror for him one hundred feet down
the river he pulled up on the bank his
fur sleek and close-lying from the water

  he drew himself up perhaps intending
to utter his chattering laugh of scorn at
the cougar on the opposite shore per-
haps he was listening to the nearing foot-
steps of hardman on the way to his tent
in fact whisperfoot angry and disap-
pointed was already slinking back into the
shadows as inconspicuously as possible
but little deaths laugh was never ut-
tered
book magazine



  he crawled up the bank into the very
mouth of hardmans tent and his littlered
eyes saw what hardman never could have
hoped to see-the head of cold eye the
serpent stretching from the blankets cold
eye also had heard the mans step and was
waiting with lifted head for any one that
came

if any one of a number of things had been

  different from what they were a certain
fight to the death on the shores of the
umpqua would have never come to pass
for it is true that few mink in their right
senses would care to attack a full-grown
rattlesnake in the first place old cold
eye was a wonderfully efficient hunter on
his own account his bulk was many times
that of little death and even the lower
intellect of a mink knew that one little
scratch of the loose-hung fangs was sim-
ply death with just a few moments of
quivering in between

  but in the first place little death was
feeling unusually sure of himself he had
just extricated himself from the claws of
a cougar and this was a legend to pass
down to his children in the second place
his blood was up from the excitement of the
chase and lastly he was angry all over
at the rabbits escape it would be hard
to imagine so many emotions flooding him
at once but their combined effect was to
put him on fighting edge the sight of
the rattler suddenly looming just in front
of him the blood-smell and the realization
that here was the noblest game he had
ever faced was like a spark to powder

  he seemed to puff out the wet hair
erected all at once and in one second
seemed to be dry the light danced in his
eyes the muscles set and contracted
seemingly withoutconscious effort and he
sprang fast as a light shaft toward the ser-
pents throat

  then there began the grim and terrible
battle that the little people of the river
came out to see cold eye was not to
be felled by that first attack the head
swayed aside then the long body lunged
out it came like a spear comes almost
straight in the air and faster than the eye
could follow little death rolled back and
over and both contestants found them-
selves in the moonlight clear outside the
mouth of the tent

  little death got in his bite as the snake
came down but he almost died to pay for
it cold eyes head whipped back and the

minks leap to safety was none too soon
the flat head seemed to graze his shoul-
der

two of the most agile the most indom-
itable slayers in the whole wilderness
world were matched on the river bank that
night-cold fury on the part of cold eye
and savage ferocity on that of little death
the moon showed the whole thing the
entire wilderness world seemed to stop in
its business and look the two fought
almost in silence so little sound that even
the song that the wind played in theimarsh
reeds was not obscured

  it is true that cold eye hissed as he
turned to parry little deaths lunges but
it was only a faint sound dying quickly in
the silence of the night and charged full
of the icy hatred of which the snake is the
embodiment and perhaps the minks light
feet rustled and crinkled in the leaves it
was almost as if he were dancing-some
savage dance of death about a victim-so
lightly did he spring back and forth the
whole fight was misty and unreal in the
moonlight two strange figures in a dance
of death only once did the rattles sound
that far-carrying warning sharp and high
that is as menacing an articulation as is
ever heard in the wilderness it was more
than that all that is deadly all the
lightning perils that can fall so swiftly on
the dwellers of the wild were symbolized
in that piercing note

  little death danced about him lunging
in again and again stroke and parry
gleaming teeth and darting head bunching
muscles and lightning lunge bite and
scratch and little wicked eyes burning out
of the savage face the serpent was more
stately bowing almost like e dancer in a
minuet he swayed gently until he
thought he saw his opening then the
long head would lunge out and thwack
down and not even the eyes of the wild
creatures were trained enough-to follow
that motion

  little death seemed so lithe so slender
so unbelievably agile that he gave almost a
reptile appearance himself the flat sav-
age head helped out the delusion only the
wicked teeth revealed his true raptorial
character cold eye had felt their sting
a half-dozen times but they had never
reached a vital place and the mink had
been afraid to bite too long and deep
the whipping head of the snake was look-
ing for just that chance
little death



  little deaths rage grew upon him with
every passing second the hair stood
straight until he looked three times his
natural size ever he leaped faster ever
his wicked little eyes had a more lurid
flame cold eye however still lived up
to his name something glittered on either
side of the flat head like bits of broken
glass strangely bright but cold enough to
freeze the blood in the veins and paralyze
the muscles little death knew enough
not to meet those eyes in a fight where
it was leap against leap fang against fang
he had a fair chance of living to tell of it
but a battle of eyes with a reptile was a
different matter little death was a
bloodspiller but he didnt know black
magic for though naturalists deny it to
the chapters end there is a power in the
cold glittering eye of a serpent and for
the little people to meet it is to be frozen
in their tracks a cold priestess to all
that is deadly and merciless-that was the
serpent fighting in the moonlight

it was an incredibly graceful thing this
 battle on the rivers bank sometimes
their shadows as they hung on the waters
edge danced off across the ripples little
death hopped back and forth now darting
almost as cold eye darted now swaying on
his haunches now leaping now recoiling
but always staying just out of the reach
of cold eyes lashing head mostly they
fought in eery silence

  if the serpent had been fighting any
other creature than a mink and had been
in the least afraid of being conquered he
would have sprung immediately into the
water it is one of the ways of serpents
to make a swift path across a river but
he knew enough not to try these tactics
here if the serpent was a water dog lit-
tle death was a fish the wild waters
were the smaller creatures own element
and he would have had every advantage

  again and again cold eye got in savage
blows strokes that didnt go quite true yet
in which the flat head had pummeled the
minks sides and little death was fright-
fully shaken and bruised by the furious
jerk and recoil of the long body every time
he himself had been able to get in a bite
but it is a trait in the nature of a mink
never to give up once embroiled in a fight
the tradition of their courage has carried
far through the wilderness not without
cause his fury increased and with it his
effectiveness ever he seemed quicker of

the blue

recoil so absorbed was he that he could
give no heed to any other danger a dozen
shadows could have flitted across the glint-
ing river and he would have never seen
them nor did he hear the descending
feet of amos hardman on the way to his
tent perhaps with one little successful
lunge cold eye could yet win the battle
in time to go back to the blankets to keep
company with the warm human figure
not that it would be warm all night
warmth dies from the veins after the rat-
tlers bite

tnce more the snake lunged out it
 was almost fatal to little death the
fangs combed the fur on his shoulder the
weight and velocity of the head knocked
him aside and the snake darted forward to
strike again and this was a mistake

  the snake was not quite in the best
position for a blow too much of his
length was already stretched out but the
truth was he had seen little death rolled
head over heels and he didnt have quite
the proper respect for the minks ability to
recoil there are none so swift so agile
as i he tells the wicked-eyed little sons
of him in the serpent nest and cold eye
thought that he himself wouldnt have been
able to snap back to a position of battle
before the poisoned fangs could sink home
but he hadnt quite counted on the fact
that a mink is almost if not quite a mas-
terpiece of nature

  it all transpired so quickly that even the
little people that watched the fight didnt
quite discern the details for the small-
est littlest fraction of a second less than
stop-watch could measure little death
seemed to lie still from the force of the
blow the snakes glittering eyes saw the
posture and he lunged down far-out with
the full force and length of his body but
when he was in the air a wonderful trans-
formation occurred in the little still hand-
ful of brown fur

  all at once little death uncoiled like a
spring he leaped to one side at the very
fraction of a second that the head darted
past cold eye had sprung too far to re-
coil the white teeth flashed cut buried
deep and closed-fairly on the serpents
spine cold eye would paralyze no more
fledglings in their tracks although his
clammy tail would have certain motion for
some hours he was simply and assuredly
dead the battle had waged out from
amos tent and the long body lay fifteen
book magazine

feet in the shadows from the door little
death had lived up to his name

  he seemed very small but wholly deadly
as he investigated the wound the blood-
madness of which the weasel tribe are par-
ticularly susceptible was on him even from
this cold blood he chattered in his rap-
ture and ferocity once more he danced
about the body as if in triumph

  but the curtain had not yet fallen on the
little drama of the river

  in the middle of his triumphal dance a
shadow swooped to the earth so fast it
came that there seemed to be no break in
the flood of moonlight it sped out of the
dark sky and it swept faster than a man
may sweep his arm along the moonlit river
margin and before the river people could
blink their eyes the dead rattlesnake was
left lying still and alone in the reeds

  velvet wing the great owl had seen his
chance at last he had dipped out of the
air swooped on his silent wings over the
battle scene and even now was darting
away with little death held fast in his
talons

the end of little death the little
people said as the shadow passed

  but its a strange thing about the world
that there is always one more card in the
sleeve of fate it was played then

  there was an astounding explosion out
of the darkness it wasnt just a small-
sized sound or even a fairly large sound
it was an incredible bellow and roar that
seemed to make the air crack and rock
about them in the silence it was a sound
to strike deaf all who heard it the little
people simply tumbled over backward with
astonishment and terror

  the shadow that was over the river
abruptly dipped in its flight it wavered
strangely and something fell out of its tal-
ons little deaths luck was with him
after all he struck not the rocky shore
but the glinting water of the river and lit-
tle death was known out and far as a high-
diver he was bleeding from the battle
with cold eye and from the daws of vel-
vet wings but neither of these things had
made him forget how to swim he struck
off boldly among the dim passages of the
sunken logs and sped to safety

  and it was all because amos hardman
had returned with his shotgun he hadnt
come in time to get in bed with cold eye
in fact he didnt even know that the rep-
tile had called on him for the serpents

by edison marshall

body was obscured in the shadows fifteen
feet distant he came just in time to see
the shadow of the owl in the moonlight and
likely enough amos hardman was still
thinking of his chickens in fact it was
one of the few subjects amos hardman-
and a good many other farmers as well-
ever did think about likely enough this
owl was flying away with one of them

  he had thrown his shotgun to his shoul-
der and fired he hadnt stopped to take
aim he was too angry at the threatened
loss of his fowl the report was the sound
the little people had heard by which they
were still almost petrified from terror
the truth was that amos had shot very
badly otherwise he could have hardly
missed the great form of the owl all he
succeeded in doing was to sink a few shots
into the feathers and along the skin and the
only result beside terror was a sudden re-
laxation of the birds muscles that caused
him to dip in his flight and open his claws
of course the rascally mink had fallen out
-safely into the river

  amos hardman heard the splash and
at first he didnt understand why he
couldnt see the clump of feathers that
would mean one of his fowl floating down
the moon-illumined river but he did see
a black head that for an instant came up
right in the middle of a glinting patch of
water and he was smitten with horror at
a sudden suspicion that came into his
mind

  may i be strung up he suddenly ex-
ploded that owl was carryin off the
mink-and i made her drop him

  he turned into his test almost speech-
less with self-wrath the ornery little
thief he roared the most worthless
useless plague-take-it varmint on the
earth what was he made for anyway-
blast his thievin bloodthirsty ways ill
get traps and get him yet

  if the mink one hundred yards down
the river had heard he might have leaned
back upon his haunches and laughed his
scorn why should he fear the traps of
men they could only continue to give
him a life of zestful adventure the years
would pass still to find him fishing and
hunting and thieving and fighting his
deadly fights in the twilight-the very
rogue and rascal that nature ordained him
to be his useless existence would con-
tinue for some time yet while out in the
shadows the last muscular quiver of cold
eyes tail had begun to die
 an exciting story of chester fay
     underworld prince and of one

 of his most daredevil exploits

 henry leverage at his best

a gray taxi was threading the
traffic of fifth avenue up
through the wealthiest street in
the world the driver flashed with
all the aplomb of a professional bucker
who knew the elastic limits of the automo-
bile laws

  chester fay leaned forward now and
then and studied the hands which shifted
the lever at the street intersections like
those of an american ace at the stick of
a biplane

  good boy he exclaimed when the taxi
came to a grinding halt before the door-
man of the hotel rockingham good
kid he added when he extended the fare

  i thank you said the driver of the
gray taxi

  fay paused at the marble steps of the
hotel rockingham the taxi turned and
darted southward

  wheeling with a pucker of interest on
his features fay strode through an alley
of palms and bronze vases and leaned over
an onyx-topped desk where stood a trim-
looking clerk whose collar and tie indi-
cated prosperity in subordinate positions

  arthur hilton fay questioned

  by appointment

beit

yy levera

  yes he phoned me at- fay glanced
up to the gilt clock over the clerks head
exactly twenty minutes ago he de-
clared

  the page who responded to the pressure
of a button led the way to a private ele-
vator nodded to the pilot and closed the
green-grilled door when fay stepped
briskly inside the cage

  he was whisked to a silent stop on an
upper floor he stepped out and faced a
gray-haired english detective of the su-
perior type who had been pacing an ornate
hallway

  arthur hilton said fay

  by sir arthurs consent

  certainly

 you may follow me drawled the
scotland yard man

  fay found himself in the foyer of a
splendid suite he waited toying with his
cap as the detective passed through a rift
in the portieres which led in the general
direction of fifth avenue he was on the
point of coughing to attract attention when
the curtains parted in invitation

cir arthur hilton stood by a long
 window with the white light of a west-
ern sky reflected across his furrowed face
like the reaching hand of a specter

  youre fay he said as the scotland
yard man backed into the shadow of an
inner room

  yes chester fay-mr george mott
the reformers friend

  good-good and bad theres the old
nick to pay putney stephney of down-
ing street-a kings greyhound-with

train at poughkeepsie this morning

  fay pulled out a cigarette

  murdered  declared hilton with a ris-
ing voice killed in cold blood somewhere
between the steamer dock at west street
and-and poughkeepsie

  fay dragged on the cigarette thrust his
hands into his pockets and leaned forward
his eyes hardened slightly they fastened
within the steady stare of sir arthurs
own	

  facts are these resumed the british
representative stephney had landed at
the dock at ten-twenty last night was
seen by two of the steamship companys
detectives who were watching all embark-
ing passengers

  was that the carpathia asked fay
yes-the carpathia stephney came
down the gangplank turned at the custom-
room went inside a telephone-booth came
out and was observed taking a gray taxi
at the foot of the dock that was the last
seen of him until the chief of the railroad
detectives at poughkeepsie found his body
on top of a goods-train skull was slightly
crushed pockets rifled portfolio with
banknotes and memoranda missing

  beastly quick shot back hilton
through rigid lips beastly clever too
the british representative glanced to-
ward the doorway before which the por-
tieres draped he strode to fays side and
leaned forward as his fingers clutched the
investigators left shoulder in the grip of
a bulldog

  stephney didnt die from the crushed
skull he said tersely that accident
came afterward he was killed by an un-
known method he was lured to death in
the heart of civilization

  an unknown method

  fact had the coroner of poughkeep-
sie on the wire not an hour ago a sur-
geon from plattsburg happened to assist at
the autopsy lt was he who detected the
condition of the lungs also stephneys
face was greenish-black

  fay backed away and allowed sir ar-
thurs hand to drop his eyes glazed with
speculation they hardened

  you have other facts he asked
little more stephney was last seen
alive getting into a gray taxi which dis-
appeared soon afterward he was headed
for this hotel i sat up until three oclock
waiting for him

  who else knew he was coming to new
york

  the washington embassy

  who knew it in london

  downing street

  whom do you suspect

  american crooks

  everybody blames them-for every-
thing

sir arthur frowned ive given you the
case-on account of mr motts interest
in ex-convicts and the gray brotherhood
oh ill take it ill jump i want all
the facts you can allow me to have

  ive given you everything the body
found at poughkeepsie on top of the goods-
train was stephneys theres no doubt of
that he was first identified by the tailors
name in his pockets-concre of london
i think weve a solicitor up there who
made a complete identification

  did stephney ever visit new york be-
fore

  once two years ago-just after the end
of the war

would he know any women here
hardly he was to come right to me 
fay moved a chair and lifted his cap
he turned at the portieres his glance to-
ward arthur hilton was one of understand-
ing

  you and mr mott alone know that i
am on this case

  it is locked with us 

  i have carte blanche

  up to ten thousand pounds
good-by said fay creasing his
cheeked cap as he parted the curtains and
strode through the suite to the hallway of
the hotel

lie jabbed at a pearl button until the

 private elevator floated up to him he
reached the street and turned toward the
avenue he saw there a gray taxi a
young man sat on the drivers seat he
was moving southward close by the right
curb 

  a swift sprint a ducking lunge before
the silver radiator of a polished limousine
the gray brotherhood

a hasty reach for the wind-shield of the
taxi and a startled exclamation from the
driver-these occurred within seven sec-
onds

  im going downtown said fay set-
tling back in the front seat and staring
boldly at the driver dont mind if i ride
out here

  i certainly do its against the com-
panys regulations

  set the meter and drive on ive really
got something i want to say to you
well of all the nerve

  certainly-certainly ive always been
interested in this new company with the
gray taxies and the paroled men who drive
them im a western newspaper man-
come from chicago suppose you tell me
all about the gray taxi company how
many taxies are there whos the orig-
inator hows business do you cover
the steamship docks

  say on the dead youve got nerve
im going to call the first traffic-cop i meet
theres one

  fay reached into his right-hand trouser
pocket his hand appeared with a five-
dollar bill between his fingers

  ill bet you this you dont he said
pressing the bill into the drivers lap
take it and buy a good dinner theres
another coming to you if you answer my
questions

  the driver clutched the steering-wheel
with both hands as he brought his knees
together and pressed a leather toe upon
the throttle the taxi leaped by the traffic
cop dodged a bus and roared on down the
avenue until an open place was gained

  go slow said fay loaf along and
let me get some dope for my article who
owns the gray taxi company

  james ponsardin

  proprietor of the morning messen-
ger

  sure he owns the company

  how many taxies

  fifty running now

  who manages it

  a girl

  what

  sure her name is elsie de groot
shes making it pay too

  thats interesting fay stared into
the alert face of the driver at the wheel
is she an ex-convict

i never heard that said about her
loyal thought chester fay shifting
in his position you never heard he re-

the blue

peated aloud thats definite do you
keep records of passengers carried

  we make a report out at night miss
elsie gets them

  do your taxies cover the steamship
docks

  sometimes-if theres a call

  fay saw that he was in the presence of
a very matter-of-fact young man who was
making his own way in the world

  mind taking me to the southampton
line he asked

  the drivers answer was to glance around
the right-hand side of the taxi slow to a
crawl then swing the comer with both
arms over the wheel

ay braced himself for five blocks of
cobbled streets upon the surface of
which ragged children played ball and
dodged death he stepped down from the
taxi as it came to a gliding stop before the
ornate entrance to the great dock

  mind waiting

  the driver glanced at the taximeter
youve paid me for a couple of hours
stay right here ill be back in ten
minutes

  chester fay found two english de-
tectives covering the dock with them was
a secret service operative of slight ac-
quaintance

  hello he said drawing this man to
one side say gardner he whispered
who would know down here what hap-
pened last night when the carpatkias pas-
sengers came down the planks i want to
trace a man who took a gray taxi the
man is-

  putney steph-stephney

  yes fay raised his brows the mat-
ter was evidently out

  has he been found

  fay shook his head he recalled that
sir arthur hilton had not given instruc-
tions to make public the matter of the find-
ing of the body on the railroad train at
poughkeepsie

  not found yet eh gardner said
well i did all i could come over here
thats right now we can talk that
british team are listening-in

  what did you find

  stephney came down the plank showed
his passports went into a slot-booth
lugged his bag and a leather case out to-
ward the street and there hailed a gray
taxi that much is settled the taxi was
driven by a chauffeur with reddish-brown
book magazine

hair his nose was slightly turned up he
had on a yellow coat and leather leggins
hed been waiting around the dock for over
three hours

  must have expected him

  looks that way chester he had plenty
of fares offered him you see them gray
taxies are all the fashion now theyre
gettin the business

  you were here at the time the passenger
arrived

  no i got my information from old
harry who watched the express wagons
and taxies hes positive about the red-
haired chauffeur said he was a bold
trick

  hes right good-by

  fay left the government operative and
darted for a telephone booth into the
slot of this he dropped a nickel and ob-
tained after a brief wait mr george
motts secretary

  this is chester fay he said briskly
say get about ten of the gray brother-
hood rounded up right away and cover
these assignments got it he added
drawing the door shut with caution yes
-yes theyll do cover poughkeepsie
and a corpse found there this morning on
top of a new york central freight-car
cover the morgue have them see the
army surgeon who made the autopsy on
the lungs have them connect with the
coroner and the railroad detectives who
found the body

  fay paused and mopped his brow with
his sleeve it was hot in the booth

  yes theres more  he snapped cover
james ponsardin of the messenger put
him to bed and get him up in the morning
find him and keep the boys tailing him
till i call them off thats all  
no send rake to the corner of the block
where the gray taxi company has its
garage tell him ill meet him there in
fifteen minutes

it was eleven minutes later when fay re-
quested the driver of the taxi to deposit
him on the northeastern comer of the
block around which gray taxies to the
number f a score or more were scattered

  fay handed over a second bill with a
polite bow

  im going to visit your boss he said
with a quick smile ill pump her in pri-
vate for that write-up of mine it ought
to go big in our western syndicate

  the driver twisted his wrist and studied

by henry leverage

the time he set the meter to the off
position good-by  he said leaning over
and releasing the emergency brake im
much obliged

  fay turned and stared into the broad
irish face of the ex-convict he had ex-
pected to meet

  ah rake-on time

  sure chester i was just watchin
you and that wild-looking driver theyre
gettiip all the high-class business

  come on follow me and keep your
eyes open were going to look a little
lady over miss isie the manager is un-
der suspicion

  fay led the way along the sidewalk and
threaded his steps through a group of
young men outside the gray taxi garage
he eyed each one for possible red hair and
tumed-up nose he entered the doorway
dodged a fast-flying taxi which was coming
out on second speed then knocked upon
the ground glass of a door marked private
-keep out-this means you

  a slip of a girl answered the knock she
glanced from fays face to the peering
countenance of rake

  well she asked

  im looking for a miss elsie de groot
said fay thrusting his foot forward im
a newspaper man i-want to write her
up for a western syndicate it ought to
bring some business

  the girl toyed with a pencil which she
jabbed like a bayonet into a raven-hued
turban ill see she said turning and
gliding through an inner door

  presently her elfin face gladdened the
opening as fay half advanced into the
outer office

  come in please miss de groot will
see you

h ester fay removed his cap
 crushed it between his fingers and
stepped briskly forward he paused be-
fore the edge of a rug across this rug sat
a girl she swiveled in a businesslike chair
and threw one neat ankle over the other
she glanced impatiently upward

  wed like to see you alone fay said
as he noted a mop of reddish hair and a
freckled nose which seemed to be pressed
up by an unseen finger alone he
added swinging upon the stenographer and
jerking his chin toward the door

  why certainly

  the girl slipped out and closed the door
fay left rakes side and moved up close
the gray brotherhood

to a littered desk which bore some resem-
blance to order

  to be brief as time he said drawing
a card from his pocket to be brief he
whispered replacing the card i want to
know just why you took a taxi at or about
six oclock last night went down to the
southampton dock and waited for a pas-
senger who wore a silver greyhound-in-
dicating that he was on british govern-
ment business urgent and pressing

  the girls broad forehead whitened
slightly she recrossed her trim ankles
she tapped the desk before her with pol-
ished nails she reached and adjusted a
hairpin in her reddish knot which added
beauty to a resolute somewhat bold face

  i dont know what business that is of
yours she said

  fay frowned its the peoples busi-
ness its charles motts business are
you going to help me

  i never talk to strangers you may be
mr motts representative you may be
connected with the gray brotherhood
how do i know

  you know what happened to your fare
last night

  the girl swung in the chair and glanced
at rake her eyes opened to brown pools
of protest she brought both feet down on
the rug and rose with her hand on the back
of the chair

  you both fetter go

  just a minute you know putney
stephney	

  perhaps i do

  you know what happened to him
  no

  do you want to know

  see here the girls voice indicated
reserve strength see here this is my
office we-i am obeying the law our
business is of such a nature that we do not
talk to strangers to tell you frankly i
detest people who ask too many questions
fay took the thrust with good humor
theyre not all the same he said mov-
ing closer to the girl and regarding her with
admiration now you for instance know
full well that i didnt come here without
being pretty sure of my ground youll
have to answer my questions or you will
be called to account for a number of nasty
accusations mr mott is your friend-he
also is my friend

  the girl turned helplessly toward the
closed door she tapped her foot on the
rug she bent her head

the blue



  how came you to know putney steph-
ney fay asked feeling his way for a
surprise

  i met him two years ago he was just
a good friend of mine i cant see your
purpose in questioning me concerning
him

  fay watched her lips tremble he had
conceived a liking for elsie de groot over
the period of minutes he said through
his white teeth

  putney stephney was murdered last
night

the girl swayed she reached blindly
   for the arms of the chair

  murdered by an unknown method

  a gasping sob racked the air the beat
of a powerful engine throbbed the garage
it was like the roll of a muffled drum

  foully murdered done to death be-
tween the steamship dock and poughkeep-
sie where he was found with skull crushed
and his lungs empty of air he was last
seen getting into your taxicab

  oh dont it isnt true

  fay leaned until his eyes compelled hers
to waver its true he whispered
now tell me what happened to putney
stephney the matter is going to do the
gray brotherhood and the gray taxi
company considerable harm

  do with him

  certainly what did you do with him
the truth and nothing but the truth its
bound to come out

  see here the girl braced her shoul-
ders and stared back defiantly see
here she flashed with sudden anger i
can give you no information except-
except what

  the record of the call that is all that
i will ever give you or anybody else my
personal affairs are not to be dragged about
by an amateur investigator

  thats all i want fay turned and
motioned for rake to leave the office he
waited until the door closed with a click

  were going to be frank he said
im here to help you out you met steph-
ney at the dock after waiting around for
hours id judge by this action that you
knew him he perhaps wirelessed or tel-
egraphed you from quarantine

  the girl brushed her hair from her eyes
with the back of her right hand she stared
at the rug then into fays keen face

  i met him by his own appointment
  ah now were getting on miss elsie
book magazine

you met him-after waiting a long time
he had an enormous sum of money you
alone knew that he was coming he trusted
in you so as to be safe in a city compara-
tively strange-to him he-

 trusted me-yes we stopped at
figaros on forty-second street we had
a club sandwich served to us i sat out-
side with him because i-i had these
clothes on

  the girl swept her hands over her leggins
and short skirt

  and then

  why i took him on uptown within six
or seven blocks of the rockingham he
said he would walk the rest of the way i
left him on the curb he started north
thats clear said fay he started
north did you see him any more

  the girl dropped her eyes and studied
the design of the office rug i did and i
didnt he got in another cab-i think
what

  yes there was no reason for him to
do that he had only a few blocks to go
in order to reach the hotel

  what kind of a cab

  one of ours-a gray taxi

  well dont you know who was driving
it was it following you

a puzzled pucker gathered in a little
 square upon the girls white forehead
she reached to the littered desk and lifted
a call-sheet she held this out with shaking
fingers

  ive questioned every one of my drivers
no one of them admits taking mr steph-
ney or anyone else to the rockingham i
didnt understand it last night i dont
now it was certainly a taxi painted like
ours that he got in i thought it so
strange

  did this other driver call him

  i dont know i was turning when i
looked up the avenue putney was running
from the curb with one hand raised he
jumped on the running-board of the taxi
which disappeared from under an arc-
light i didnt see anything more

  didnt that strike you as a strange pro-
ceeding

  yes it did i thought a lot about it
i went over the call-sheet and asked all of
the drivers two are out yet but i know
where they were at the time

  do you often take representatives of
the british government around have
they a charge-account

by henry leverage



  i cank answer those questions you
must ask mr hilton

  do you want to tell me anything about
james ponsardin

the girl started she folded the call-
sheet by running it through her fingers
no i dont youll have to see him
fay fished in his pocket and brought
forth the same card he had before shown
to the girl

  youll find me at mr george motts
office please call me up if you discover
anything ask those two drivers whom
you didnt question help us in every
way this murder is an international mat-
ter keep thinking about what happened
last night we must find the murderer
fay laid the card on the desk bowed
slightly toward the silent girl nodded to
the stenographer and joined rake in the
run-way of the garage

the big ex-convict was staring at the
group of drivers who were awaiting
assignments he smiled broadly as he felt
fays hand on his shoulder

  some bunch chester

  any of your old pals here

  the only one i remember is that snob-
nosed mechanic over there-the fellow un-
der that car

  fay wheeled a pair of bright eyes
grease-rimmed and shadowed with blond
lashes was peering out at him a tapping
sounded upon the rear axle of the taxi as
fay stooped a trifle the mechanic ex-
tended one hand and coiled his fingers
about a spanner

  the only one in the place said rake
i served time with him somewhere-
maybe in sing sing maybe joliet

  come on rake

  fay led the way to the sidewalk nodded
pleasantly to the staring drivers then
turned toward the west it was at the
corner of the block where he paused and
glanced in the direction of the garage

  the entire case rests there he de-
clared without pointing stephney was
murdered in a gray taxi he was suffo-
cated in some way to render him uncon-
scious he was tossed on top of a freight-
train after being well plucked this much
we know now how was it done

  i dont think a woipan was mixed up in
it that girl looked like a perfect lady
an old night-hawk who is as crooked as
his whip might do it he could get a cab
an turn the trick
the gray brotherhood

  but the mysterious way of suffocating
a man

  the ex-convict scratched his head
thats different he admitted
otoole flynn fogarty harris an john-
son-they ought to discover something
chester harrigan mr motts man sent
them running after you telephoned hes
called on the harlem branch for three
more of the brotherhood to cover the case
youve got nine or ten boys out now
hardly enough well get more sup-
pose we walk west for a block or two i
want to think this puzzle over

  rake fell in behind fay they crossed
the street and took a shady side the last
rays of the western sun struck slanting
through the canon of tenements the
street resounded with the shouts of urchins
playing ball a truck went by as fay
paused and clicked keys in his pocket

  he glanced up at rake

  well have to cover the hudson river
homes he said looks to me as if the
body was being taken over the railroad
track when it was thrown on top of a
freight-car who is investigating pough-
keepsie and the routing of the train
otoole an flynn went north ches-
ter

  fay dragged out his watch and studied
the dial its too early yet for them to
report its too-

tie stared open-mouthed toward the

   avenue ahead of him he reached
and clutched rakes arm he gripped this
with fingers of steel

  did you seethat

  see wot chester

  the gray taxi that went by

  i saw one i didnt notice it partic-
ularly

  it was being driven thirty miles an
hour by elsie de groot im positive it
was her reddish hair and turned-up
nose

  thats the colleen who runs the ga-
rage

  yes-the girl of the garage the same
little lady who met putney stephney at the
steamship dock last night

  were gettin on chester it looks bad
for the brotherhood

 and for the sisterhood we just fin-
ished talking to her not a half-not twenty
minutes ago and there she goes uptown-
full speed and more

  fay eyed his watch and ran a polished

the blue



finger-nail over the crystal twenty-two
minutes he declared replacing the time-
piece in his vest pocket

  lets go back chester

  no well go on to the office of the
morning messenger foley is their sport-
ing editor perhaps he can tell us some-
thing about ponsardin and the taxi-com-
pany

  nice name blurted the ex-inmate
sounds like a doped wine an deep-dyed
villainy

  fay grasped rake by the elbow and
hurried him in the direction of the avenue
up which the taxi had flashed there was
no trace of it fay hesitated a moment
like a keen hound on a scent then fell
into a brisk walk northward which took
him to the somewhat unostentatious build-
ing that housed the uptown offices of the
m essenger

  foley the sporting editor was in he
greeted fay with a hand thrust over a bat-
tered typewriter propped upon a broken
desk he thrust aside a bundle of press
clippings and cleared off two chairs

  sit down he welcomed got some
dope on the crook game for me

  fay leaned back and glanced about the
office with slow caution then shot a ques-
tion at foley through rigid lips

  what do you know about ponsardin-
your proprietor

  foley tried to wink with lashless eye-
lids he upended a huge can of cold tea
drank deeply glanced at the keyboard of
his typewriter before he set the can down
on the corner of a box which had once con-
tained ink rolls

  what do i know nothing hes a
queer stick bought the paper about three
years ago hardly ever see him goes to
washington quite often the police are
investigating the sheet i guess

 ah said fay	

  yep theres been talk of the actual
ownership being in the hands of a lot of
sure-thing grafters and gamblers im look-
ing for a knockout and an upper-cut from
the postal authorities any time you
cant pinch me i dont write the ed-
itorials

  they advocate horse-racing and open
gambling

  they certainly did-a year or two ago
now weve been instructed to hit a bunch
of contractors and reformers take it from
me fay i dont think the messenger is
making any money
book magazine

  bills paid and all that

  oh sure james ponsardin is rated
three as and a one

  is he french or swiss

  came from switzerland i think bright
fellow but-

  where does he live directory gives
an apartment on riverside drive

  i went up there once with some tickets
to a bout he wasnt there butler said
he was up-state i guess hes dug in cov-
ered up and pulled the hole in after him
no one around here or downtown knows
where to find him

  do you know anything about the gray
taxi company

  the one with the ex-convict drivers
  chester fay nodded

  no i heard the bunch talking about
it why did you ask

  fay rose from his chair and threw back
his shoulders your boss is supposed to
own it he said ponsardin is the owner
ive got a case thats far from being clear
foley ill give you first chance when
ive worked it out for mr mott good-
by 

dake led the way out and down the

	 steps to the street

  where to chester he asked as they
stood on the sidewalk

  nearest telephone said fay thrusting
his hands in his pockets in search for some
change

  rake waited outside of the cigar-store
while fay entered a booth night was
dropping on the city the sun had set over
the blue barriers of the palisades the
lights of broadway sashed the purple
heavens from south to north forty-sec-
ond street with its sign-clusters marked
the center of the illumination

  it was a long ten minutes before fay
emerged with his teeth clamping a slender
perfecto he passed one to rake

  smoke up he said its on the brit-
ish representatives ive got a good lead
from arthur hilton its one i overlooked
in my haste this morning i think we get
our people tonight

  what people chester

  the crooks who killed stephney they
were after bigger game the others of
stephneys suite are due on the imparada
hilton tells me privately that she has been
sighted from sandy hook

  rake examined the cigar then lighted it
and started puffing

by henry leverage



  i dont get you whats due on the
ship whats it got-to do with-

  fay started toward broadway rake
followed with the question still upon his
mind

  were closing in said fay as he
brought a sheet of paper from his side
pocket and spread it out on the palm of
his right hand i did a lot of phoning
theres nothing new at poughkeepsie-ex-
cept that the train upon which stephneys
body was found was made up on tenth
avenue new york

  thats death avenue

  its well named it left at seven
oclock it passed the harlem river at
eight-sixteen it reached harmon at nine-
three it rolled into poughkeepsie early
in the morning and was shunted on a side-
track the railroad detectives searched it
carefully while looking for tramps it was
then they found the body

  rake eyed the sheet of paper

  did otoole get all that he asked
yes he saw the coroner and the army
surgeon stephney was suffocated and
completely out of this life when his body
was dropped on top of the train that
must have been from some small bridge
leading over the tracks to the hudson
river it was either to a boathouse or a
private estate

  go on said rake

  hilton-sir arthur-tells me that two
members of the same banking firm coming
over on the imparada have considerable
money with them this commission of
which stephney was a member came on
different steamers on account of a secret
matter pertaining to pending treaties
these two members will dock sometime to-
night

  at the same pier chester

  at the southampton pier

  that looks like business well be
there eh

  right there well meet the bankers
at quarantine substitute ourselves for
them and land all regular and proper at
the southampton dock i notified har-
rigan at mr motts office to get our out-
fits theyll be waiting for us with a valet
at the battery we will have a valet
what chester

  joe yeader will play that part to per-
fection remember his accent he did
time in brixton jail

  i dont get it all blurted rake what
is coming off
the gray brotherhood	the blue



cay furrowed his brow and stared se-
 riously toward the paper in his hand
he thrust it into his pocket ill explain
later he said were going right into
the lions den well bait the trap with
more banknotes weve got to clear the
name of the gray brotherhood and the ex-
inmates working for the gray taxi com-
pany

  do you suspect that girl

  i have every reason to believe she is
guilty

  she dont look the part

  looks and beauty are skin deep

  she didnt talk like a gun moll or a
fallen sister

  shes employed by a man who is sus-
pected by the police and mr mott she
has sole charge of ponsardins taxicab in-
terests she was the first to meet stephney
on this side of the atlantic she was the
last to see him alive according to her own
admission what would you think from
all that

  i think a lot chester but appear-
ances are deceiving shed never admitted
takin that stephney from the dock if she
was guilty shed of denied it the only
time my mary at home is lyin to me is
when she says nothing

   illogical logic

  sure-an its the truth nine times out
of ten chester

  fay glanced at his watch and quick-
ened his steps well take the subway
to the customhouse from there we go
over the bay

  rake scratched his head and followed
fay down the steps past the ticket-
chopper and lunged with him into the
warm interior of a subway car they were
hurtled southward fay said nothing dur-
ing the quick trip his mind wove the
details of the plan which he had to save
the name of the gray brotherhood

  he mounted to the surface of the street
closely followed by rake he sought a
phone-booth before crossing to the custom-
house rake heard him giving a series of
rapid-fire directions to harrigan the man-
ager at george motts headquarters

  fay emerged tossed a dollar across to
the cigar-clerk and jerked his thumb to-
ward a box of perfectos eight of those 
he said eight

  outside in the cool evening the two
men drew a long breath of smoke for the
final plunge they dodged a flashing taxi
climbed the customhouse steps and

found after consulting an alert doorman
that the harbor masters assistant was in

  to him fay showed his card his au-
thority from george mott and other iden-
tifications he sealed the matter with a
cigar the assistant to the harbor master
made out passes in duplicate he found
the sealing wax and a well-chewed pen he
passed the finished documents over after a
scrawled signature in each corner

  theyll take you aboard anything from
here to the hook he said leaning and
watching fay

  thanks said fay ill see if they
will

the ferry-house was thronged with pas-
sengers as the two ex-inmates searched
about for joe yeader these passengers
thinned a man stepped forward and
clucked from the comer of his mouth

  all right said fay swiftly hop
aboard and well follow

 rake trailed yeader and fay the
three men secured seats in the smoking-
cabin yeader crossing his legs over a
yellow kit-bag took fays proffered per-
fecto and drawled

  at your service sirs beastly sultry
night

  the ferry-boat reached st george the
three rushed for a train which would pass
quarantine station on an inland route
they descended at a dark station walked
rapidly through silent streets till they came
to the gleaming waters of the narrows

  fay saluted a man on guard showed
his authority from the customhouse and
received permission to enter the telegraph
station

  he turned on the steps and glanced down
at yeader and rake

  stay here he said hold the bag
im going up and find out when the im-
parada comes in also i shall send a wire-
less message to the manager of the gray

  rake started he frowned in perplex-
ity how can you do that chester
ive got authority to do most anything
i want a gray taxi to meet us when we
dock with the imparada perhaps your
nice little blonde with the turned-up nose

  rake shook his head when fay disap-
peared he clenched his fists and glanced
upward at the topmost light in the dark
tower he swung on one heel as yeader
touched his shoulder
book magazine

  big ship coming in

  the imparada

  looks like it well have to hurry
call chester

  fay appeared at rakes third shrilling
whistle

  all set he said waving his arm to-
ward the government dock lets get
down to the quarantine boat

  a dark wharf jutted like a pointing
finger from a green sloping shore upon
this wharf great rusty cables and buoys
were scattered

  fay led the way through the buoys and
presented his passes to a sailor on guard
before a wire gate

  going out to the imparada i he said
authoritatively

  the sailor hitched his trousers turned
squinted through the sea mists then swung
the gte

  youll have to hurry he said the
quarantine boat is casting off her shore
lines

yy rapped in the cloak of gray vapor
the three men crouched forward of
the wheelhouse and stared out across the
narrows to where a great ship glided like
a glow-worm in a garden

  they heard the quarantine boats bells
as it maneuvered beneath the towering
overhang of the giant passenger ship they
mounted a pilots ladder which had been
lowered for the quarantine officers

  fay whispered into an officers ear after
he sprang over the rail he motioned aft
rake and yeader with the kit-bag fol-
lowed closely

  the two british bankers were seated at
the taffrail to them fay told his mis-
sion and his object of substituting him-
self and party in order to discover who had
slain stephney the bankers had already
been informed of the murder they were
noncommittal they rose from steamer
chairs studied fays credentials stared
keenly at yeader and rake then consulted
in whispers

  all right they said finally come to
our staterooms

  the transformation which was made
while the ship glided to her dock was thor-
ough and startling fay upended yeagers
kit-bag and sorted out its contents he
changed his appearance before the eyes of
the silent britishers he put on goggles
and borrowed a more pronounced checked
cap than the one he had worn to the ship

by henry leverage



he ran a hand across his face then tapped
a well-bound packet suggestively

  all set he said looking at himself in
a glass by jove george mott or ar-
thur hilton wouldnt know me

  wrapping a long mackintosh about his
slender form fay threw open the door and
led the way to the boat-deck

  well stand here he said to rake and
yeader the ship is almost in now
play your parts look out for a gray
taxi

  the ship snugged against the dock un-
der pressure from two snorting tugs
steam plumed aft the giant funnels a
bell clanged its final message to the en-
gine-room a gangplank was raised in the
gloom it steadied and swung inboard

  come cried fay follow me

  the way led down through a companion
along a luggage-littered deck and past the
second officer who gave the signal that
they could descend the gangplank

  fay shaded his face from the central
office men at the foot of the plank he
turned and motioned for rake and yeader
they hurried over the splintered dock and
reached the first of the shore throng to
meet the incoming passengers

  go ahead said fay to yeager lug
the bag and find the taxi tell the driver
youre from the british banking commis-
sion pile on all the cockney you know

the throng parted fay saw to one
side of the dock entrance a waiting
taxi upon its seat a form crouched
yeager waved his hand opened the taxi
door tossed in the bag and assisted fay
and rake to mount the running-board and
step inside

   otel rockingham exclaimed yeager
go aead

  the door clicked shut with a strong
pressure the driver lowered the taxi-
meter flag released the brake and moved
through first second and into third speed
with the cunning manipulation of a pro-
fessional

  fay rubbed the thick plate glass at his
side glanced out at the flashing lights and
street intersections before he leaned down
and opened the bag

  take these he whispered handing
rake and yeader two heavy automatics
plant them on the seat now this
hatchet

  joe yeader straightened with the pack-
age in his hand he broke the string
the gray brotherhood



ripped off the wrapping paper and held out
a bright-looking hatchet

  hold it ready said fay were
turning into fifth avenue

  the taxi swerved straightened and
lunged northward rake sputtered and
swore as he attempted to open a door
yeager bent over and tried the knob on
the other door

  did you notice our driver asked fay
red hair and turned-up nose said
yeager what to hell kind of a bloody
trap did we get into

  rake turned and pressed his nose against
the front glass of the taxi he turned as
fay reached and jerked down the blind

  its elsie de groot he blurted its
the dame of the garage 

  listen

  a slight noise like a steam-exhaust
sounded fay reached close by the seat

he pressed one knee against yeager he
nodded comprehendingly

  the airs gettin thinner exclaimed
rake i cant breathe

  fay dropped to his knees swayed and
ran his hand over the bottom of the cab

he curled into a knot with his feet on the
seat he raised a hand and indicated for
rake and yeager to bend down

  were supposed to be dead he whis-
pered theres a suction pump on the
engine thats exhausting the air from the
cab the driver started the pump when
she started the cab the windows and
framework are built to withstand enormous
outside pressure

  he taxi came to a sudden halt at a curb

    the driver sprang from the front seat
mounted the running-board and pressed a
pair of sharp eyes against the side glass
fay rake and yeager lay on the cab
floor with their faces shielded by their up-
thrown arms

  the driver swung into the seat raced
the engine and clicked through the speeds
the taxi darted up fifth avenue it
gained fifty-ninth street and turned into
the park it swung the dark curves on
its swift passage uptown

  fays fingers groped along the seat and
clasped an automatic get the other
he said into rakes ear you yeager
take the hatchet and pry at the bottom of
the door ive got my hand over the suc-
tion pipe we wont be suffocated

  the ride seemed endless the taxi
rolled from out the foliage of the park and

the blue

climbed a long hill it turned northward
along street-car tracks

  broadway said fay sensing his po-
sition were going right out broad-
way

  rake gasped and pressed a finger across
his mouth he coughed pounded his chest
and recovered himself his eyes glared in-
dignantly he waited till the taxi clat-
tered over a bridge then he protested
let me out chester ill wring that
damn girls neck lcant stand this much
longer theres no air

  sisst said fay are you sure elsie
de groot is driving the taxi

  sure id swear to it

  fay chuckled well soon know this
is yonkers weve passed getty square
were turning now now were going
north two turns and then a straight
road id know where we are blind-
folded

it was twenty minutes later when the taxi
slowed backed then swung toward the
left and took a narrow bumpy road fay
sat up pressed his toe on the sucking ex-
haust-pipe and clamped his teeth with a
suggestive grind

  all ready he said nudging yeager
see were rising were going across a
bridge listen thats the new york
central railroad below us this is where
stephney was thrown on the freight-train
now-look out

  the taxi dropped down a long sharp
incline with its brakes grinding it round-
ed a lodge-gate swung by a dark stone
house and came to a sudden halt in a shel-
tered courtyard

  the driver sprang out fay braced his
feet against the door he heard two voices
in whispered conversation a third joined
in with a protesting snarl the handle of
the door clicked a key was inserted the
lock snapped open

  fay bent his knees aimed at the exact
center of the panel and kicked outward
he rolled over with the force of his blow
he staggered from the cab with yeager
and rake scrambling after him

  get up your hands he exclaimed
jabbing forward the automatic up
up up all three of you 

  rake lunged swiftly and wrapped his
arms about the forward figure of a startled
group he went down with the man un-
der iim 

  the two figures in front of fays auto-
book magazine

matic hesitated spread and bolted to right
and left fay lowered his gun fired once
at the ground then dashed in pursuit of the
taxi-driver whose khaki leggings were a
fair mark to follow

  he gained with each stride he reached
forward stumbled over a low wall and
clutched a coat which was torn from his
fingers he bounded across a roadway
dropped the automatic and made a flying
tackle which brought his quarry to the
close-cropped grass

  lie still you  he ordered as his fingers
closed on a pair of flailing arms get
downl i think i know you

ays hands gripped with strength he
 heard a low moan below him and
eased the clutch he had fastened upon a
thick throat he wheeled and stared toward
the courtyard rake had already secured
his prisoner the big ex-convict was look-
ing up the road which merged into gloom
and dripping trees a man was bounding
along this road with yeager close behind
him the cockney raised his revolver in
a slow aim he lowered it and dashed on
a taxi with blazing cones of yellow light
swung over the bridge across the railroad
track and began descending the grade it
slowed it stopped with a shriek of metal
bands on metal

  two drivers sprang from the front seat
and reached for the man whom yeager
was pursuing he sank to his knees in the
roadway as other forms scrambled from the
taxi he was surrounded by a resolute
group of taxi-drivers their leader called
an order and came running toward the taxi
in the courtyard

  fay twisted his fingers in a close collar
ran his hand over the figure below him and
found in a pocket a matted red wig he
sprang erect

  the mechanic of the garage he ex-
claimed you settle one doubt you im-
personated elsie de groot

  the leader of the drivers who had ar-
rived in the second taxi ran across the
courtyard paused and stared at fays

by henry leverage

prisoner she turned with her eyes sweep-
ing the windows of the silent house she
came over the grass

  just in time miss elsie said fay
you got a man up the road who was
he

  a crook and this is-

  this is one of your mechanics he re-
sembles you he must have had access to
your desk he impersonated you by put-
ting on a wig after you set stephney down
on fifth avenue he was ponsardins tool
his taxi was equipped with a suction-pipe
and a set of snap locks on the doors it
was death to enter it they were after big
game tonight

  the girl shuddered she turned away
from fay and his prisoner

  i dont know how it all happened she
said i suspected the mechanic after your
visit we followed him tonight he had
a taxi exactly like ours we lost him in the
park we were close behind you then-
we found the trail again up above yonkers
it led here you see he had different tires
than most cars one was vulcanized on
the tread and made a different mark in the
dust

  that was clever

  the girl trembled slightly

  whos the third man fay asked
-the one you looked at before you came
over to me

  oh thats ponsardin hes the owner
of the gray taxi company i wonder
what will become of it now i hate to see
the boys lose their jobs

  they wont and you wont im sure i
can fix things so that once in a while i can
drop around and call upon miss elsie de
groot-president and general manager of
the gray taxi company-which mr
george mott will surely take care of no
matter what happens to ponsardin

  the girl seized fays extended hand
thatll be corking the gray brother-
hood has certainly cleared its name to-
night

the story continues

  a

iis is not so bad reflected uth-
man al hudr with great compla-
cency i lost the white pearl
and agha fraser may melek
taus curse him but now i have gained
the white pearl again and with her the
son of fraser-and i think i can take
vengeance upon the son no less than upoh
the father

  a smile grew in his dark stern face as
he gazed upon the moving cavalcade

  free of all jaf vengeance had escaped
al hudr and his men-free with their
booty and slaves past the aorami moun-
tain wall past that steep and precipitous
defile which led into the penjivan fastness
-that defile which ten men could hold
against an army-and they now were head-
ing homeward	
bob fraser riding bound among other
captives-most of whom were women or
girls-was glimpsing a district upon which
few outsiders had ever looked ahead

towering into the blue sky was the mighty
rock of penjivan a rock of sheer scarp a
black segment of the persian land upthrust
at heaven in challenge here and in the
few valleys around that could be entered
in only one or two places had dwelt
through ages the persian sect whose yezidi
brethren were strewn in mesopotamia

  from the talk of those about him on
that fast hard flight into refuge fraser
had learned much the religion of the
satan-devotees forbade them any dealing
with the outside world the faith of these
persian folk differed somewhat from that
of their kin over the border and among
them had arisen al hudr a commanding
force not to be denied he had welded
them as he wished and was now theif
emir in rule as well as in religion

  primitive were the habitations that nes
tied among the crags and hillsides and
primitive were the people who gazed upon
the long columns winding through the se-
eluded valleys wild mountaineers were
these worshipers of satan yet as he came
among them and passed their villages and
listened to the talk around him frasef wat
astonished more and more by the simplicity
of the folk and the quaintly stark contra-
dictions of their faith-a faith which com-
prised the beliefs of islam the mosaic cus
toms of the jews and the sacraments of
christianity

  at the doorways of all the houses that


the brazen peacock

he saw were great clusters of crimson
flowers and when he questioned one of his
guards concerning this he found that in
the month of the yezidi new year every
family of baptized devil-worshipers adorned
their doorways thus as a symbol of their
faith-the black book commanded it said
the warrior upon fraser hinting that the
custom might have been borrowed from the
jews the persian scoffed loudly and be-
rated him for an ignorant infidel

in the midmost of that caravan his

	gloomy band of men around him rode
shaik nuri he and his followers had sent
their women-folk and choicest possessions
on to penjivan when first the fury of
tahir beg and the hamavands had burst
on sulaimanieh so that they were now
forced to go thither themselves it was
a bitter pill for that proud shaik nuri a
most bitter pill for now a hudr had taken
the white pearl from him and on every
hand the yezidis jibed and scoffed at him
-and to be the butt of such a joke is an-
guish to every moslem yet he was help-
less against the power of a hudr he dared
nothing

  the yezidis hill warriors all thought
that their leader had played a crafty and
clever game the white pearl had been
stolen and all the blame and brunt had
fallen upon shaik nuri who had lost his
city and barely escaped with his life es-
caping he had found the white pearl and
had blindly carried her on to a hudr-
who had blandly taken her again an ex-
cellent joke

  the great point to this jest was that in
the yezidi mythology the name of white
pearl figured largely as a symbol of the
creation therefore it was very meet that
a hudr should mate with her after this
month of the new year should be past for
this reason also great honor was paid to
sefid as he marched with a hudrs per-
sonal slaves and booty bob f raser watched
the breed camels which bore her on ahead
presents were showered upon her by all the
folk-gifts of flowers jewels cloths by
those who sought her future favor with a
hudr and this fact gave bob fraser an
inspiration

  since that morning when he had de-
parted to fetch flour bob fraser had not
returned to the house of tahir beg he
had ridden hard with the chieftain and
had been in the thick of the fighting at
sulaimanieh thus he had been given no

the blue

chance to deposit the brazen peacock with
his own effects for tahir beg carried no
baggage in the field

  wishing to keep the brazen image which
promised to have some value fraser had
sewn it into a corner of his saddle-bags
these bags had been woven in kilim
fashion by sefid herself and had been a
present to him from the girl now on
the march into penjivan bob fraser had
noted that in the division of the booty his
horse and saddle had fallen to the lot of
one of the guards who watched over a
hudrs slaves

  except for being stripped of his wea-
pons fraser had not been robbed at the
time of his capture there had been great
haste and confusion and later on it was no
doubt thought that he had been stripped
by his first captors

  so on the night before they came to a
hudrs stronghold on the penjivan rock
fraser took his store of english gold from
his belt and went to this guard

  here friend he gave the man a sov-
ereign as he spoke there are more of
these if you will do me a certain favor-
one that will advantage you also by al-
lahs grace

  well said infidel speak

  when i was among the hamavands i
knew the white pearl well pursued bob
fraser on that horse which you ride
is her own saddle and the bags were woven
by her own hand take them to her and
she will be much pleased with the gift
mention my name that she may intercede
for me with a hudr she will bear you
in mind also and these things may lead to
some good for both of us

  by the bird of melek taus that is
good news exclaimed the warrior eagerly
keep your gold infidel i have more
plunder now than i can carry and this
news will make the fortunes of us both
good i will make the gift thfs very
night

  so the man did reporting later that
sefid had received the bags with great joy
and accounting his future assured the
warrior was only too glad to help fraser
on the march since the saddle-bags had
thus come to sefid bob fraser was certain
that her wit would see some hidden reason
therein and would find the brazen peacock
it might be of great use to her in any emer-
gency he knew

  as for himself he had no hope realizing
that a hudr meant to vent that ancient
book magazine



hatred upon him sefid had informed him
of the things that lay betwixt his father
and a hudr and fraser did not doubt
that the chieftain meant to take vengeance
upon him for his fathers actions of sixteen
years previously

tnce or twice he saw the two hama-
 vands who had been taken prisoner
with him they were slaves and seemed
to be accepting their lot with a stoical
calm of escape there was no chance and
any hope of rescue seemed equally vain
to north east and south the penjivan val-
leys were defended by the great ramparts
of the snowy peaks the only direct en-
trances - from the west were capable of
being defended by small forces against any
army here in these mountain fastnesses
the yezidis had dwelt for centuries unmo-
lested-fierce fighters too poor to make
the effort of conquering them profitable

  uthman al hudr was now making them
rich with plunder bringing the world to
them and fraser when he saw the city of
penjivan open before him knew that the
chieftain had seized upon and made the
most of the chance of a lifetime

  in ancient days some fortress of the
sassanid kings had crowned this mighty
rock whose flat top and devious ascent
made it an impregnable stronghold for
the folk dwelling in the valleys roundabout
the old walls were here repaired by uth-
man enclosing the whole surface of the
hill-crest and within the walls were build-
ings new and old fraser gained an im-
pression of wide streets stout stone-built
houses with scarlet flowers at their doors
fountains and running brooks beside the
way then before his immediate section
of the caravan opened a gate in a wall-
and he was in the center and very heart of
this ancient town the citadel or palace
of the old kings that was now the pal-
ace of al hudr the adventurer

  this like the outer town conveyed the
idea of being new yet ancient-the walls
huge blocks of hewn stone repaired and
renewed the decorations the tiles the ex-
tensive gardens all seeming to have been
done on ancient lines al hudr had taken
this ruined city of the kings and had re-
stored it faithfully within this citadel
was actually an inner city-and for this
there was a reason

  bob fraser was kicked into one of a
number of cells that lined the inner side
of the wall these cells overlooked the

by h bedford-jones

gardens among which were situated other
buildings the palace the chief local shrine
at which the yezidis worshiped the harem
or forbidden quarters of the women be-
longing to the inner garrison and other
structures gazing forth from his cell at
this scene fraser soon came to an under-
standing of the situation here in the inner
city it was not hard to comprehend for
numbers of men were continually passing
the line of cells their talk deafening the
ear and of these men few showed the
distinctive garb of the yezidis many of
them wore the forbidden blue nearly all
were persians of kurds as their attire testi-
fied and most of them swore by allah
rather than by melek taus

  al hudr the adventurer may have been
originally a yezidi at any rate he had
come here to penjivan and had gathered
a force of outlaws behind him for a nucleus
around this nucleus he had gathered the
yezidi folk from their scattered valleys
here in the inner citadel he lived with his
chosen band all of whom were of course
nominal converts to the religion of melek
taus and from here he was extending his
power in a widening arc

  it was no mean power from the talk
he heard fraser gathered that this stroke
at the sharizur plain was the first really
extensive blow that al hudr had dealt
there were to be no more scattered raids
no more night-ridings in small bands al
hudr had now placed himself and his
yezidis in the field openly contenders for
temporal rule into the lives of the isolated
yezidis he had brought the wide world
and for them he would carve a kingdom
in the world after this there would be no
raids there would be the march of armies

all that long afternoon as into the
inner citadel poured the slaves and the
loot of al hudr and his chosen band the
talk poured up like incense before the cells
fraser heard much boasting about future
deeds-extending a conquest over persia
was the least of the intended triumphs
alliances he gathered had been already
formed with many tribes around and one
of shaik nuris dejected men was solemnly
promised that within two months the shaiks
would be restored to sulaimanieh and
placed at the head of all the kurdish
tribes

  theyre wild drunk with exultation and
blood reflected fraser sitting in his bare
cell and watching the dusty scene from
the brazen peacock



gloomy eyes al hudr has given them
plunder and fighting these yezidis op-
pressed and scattered for ages have gath-
ered around his tangible and visible stand-
ard with all their fanatical strength-hes
an able devil all right i wonder where
dad and tahir beg are this minute

  to this there was no answer

  with the morning he had sight of uth-
man al hudr who entered the inner city
in triumph passing within a hundred yards
of the prison cells the chieftain wore now
a helmet and suit of chain-mail such as
may still be found in persia-more for
romantic appearance than for utility-and
over his shoulders was slung a huge cloak
of vivid green this no doubt was the
reason of his nickname al hudr or the
green one fraser never afterwards saw
him without this cloak which he appeared
always to wear when in penjivan

  uthmans men lined the walls and the
street leading into the gardens behind the
chieftain was a long procession of the
yezidi folk headed by their priests-pirs
and skaiks-clad in ceremonial garments
of white linen

  the procession passed onward to the
shrine-the tomb of some yezidi saint-
and away from frasers sight there was
not a glimpse of sefid and what had be-
come of her he knew not

  in the two days that intervened he heard
more than one scrap of talk concerning
her talk which showed him that she was
not in the harem but had been given a
share in the palace itself-to the yezidis
superstitious folk at best her name and
her destined marriage with al hudr seemed
to place her on an equality with the chief-
tain al hudr was fostering this impres-
sion fraser gathered that he was intense-
ly proud of his bride-to-be and wished by
all means to increase her prestige among
the people he ruled

  on the third day after this one of the
persian guards unlocked the door of bob
frasers cell and summoned him forth

  come nazarene our lord wishes
speech with you

  fraser followed his guard not without
much relief for he had begun to think
that his very existence was forgotten in-
stead of being led to the palace he was
somewhat surprised when he was conducted
through the gardens to a terrace that was
floored with ancient marble flags in the
midst of which played a pool of water with
a small fountain in its center

the blue

  by this fountain was standing al hudr
the latter eyed bob fraser keenly then
ordered the guard to withdraw the two
men were left alone

  peace be with you agha fraser said
al hudr a thin smile on his virile features
i have not forgotten you but in the past
days i have been busy do you know that
betwixt me and your father lies an ancient
evil

  i have heard something of it said
fraser quietly in the chieftains face he
read a cruel and intolerable pride and it
came to him that he was now to suffer
torture yet in this he erred

  when you fell into my hands said al
hudr watching him it seemed to me that
by taking vengeance upon you i should
thus allay my hatred for your father so
indeed i meant to do yet now it seems
to me that this would be but a sorry action
and one most unworthy of me my quarrel
is not with you but with your father and
with him shall i settle so on that head
agha fraser fear nothing

  i am not afraid and fraser smiled
a little i am astonished that there should
be so keen a strain of nobility in a robber
chieftain like you uthman if you have
no quarrel with me why do you keep
me prisoner for what purpose

al hudrs eyes narrowed sleepily like
 the eyes of a watching cat

  softly infidel i have quarrel enough
he answered you slew rasul majid
who was an emir of the yezidis and who
had been traveling among the mosul
branch of our people exhorting them to
join me here therefore your death is de-
manded by my folk his brethren

  that was fair fighting said fraser
simply al hudr nodded

  so i have heard and by melek taus
it seems that you are no coward know
you where your father and tahir beg now
are

  rattling at your gates with the jaf
tribes behind them i suppose

  no al hudr frowned they have
disappeared may the angels seize on them
if they were at my gates well and good
through those they could not break well
no matter you are here and the white
pearl is mine

  unless you release her unharmed per-
sian said fraser steadily fate will surely
find you if you force her into your
harem i will not rest until i have your
book magazine



life and although i am your prisoner and
you may kill me my father and tahir
beg will stay upon your trail until they
have pulled you down so take warning
let her go free with me and we have no
further interest in your affairs otherwise
this crime will invite your fate-

  a hudr laughed softly

  cease your prattling child what care
i for you or your friends now listen to
me do you remember the image of the
brazen peacock that was in the house of
tahir beg

  yes said bob fraser it was mine
my man who bore it in the flight
thence was probably killed said a hudr
that was a great loss to me for this image
was one of the seven sacred sanjaks or
standards of our faith and since the days
of the emir solomon had been handed
down among the yezidis where that
image now is you doubtless can tell be-
sides that two only now remain and they
are in the hands of the mosul branch of
our people i want that brazen peacock
agha fraser and for it i offer you your
life

  ah  said fraser i am not too greatly
concerned with my life just now a hudr
what about the white pearl if you will
send her back unharmed to her father you
shall have the-

  fool she is here and she stays here
-better the white pearl than a thousand
of peacocks  the eyes of a hudr flashed
let her name not again pass your lips
infidel it is for your life and that alone
that i bargain do you accept or not

  for a bare moment fraser hesitated
then he came to swift decision

  where it is now i cannot say he an-
swered but i will write a note which
you will send to tahir beg demanding
that the brazen peacock be given the mes-
senger when the latter brings it here you
will release me is that sufficient

  a hudr eagerly assented

  agreed when it arrives you shall go
free-the word of uthman upon it until
then give me your parole-

  not at all said fraser if i am a
captive i am a captive

  the other shrugged his shoulders very
well turning he clapped his hands and
a guard appeared

  take this man to the palace and give
him the room assigned to him said a
hudr he will write a letter which you
will bring me wal salamt

  i have made it a strict rule that every-
  one shall refrain from worshiping all gods

  -revelation of melek taus

having seen that a hudrs pas-
sionate eagerness to possess the
brazen peacock quite overbore his
crafty prudence fraser had not hesitated
to drive the bargain it could only afford
him a temporary relief for it could not be
long until a hudr would know that sefid
possessed the image however bob fraser
found himself released from the cage-like
cell and he was sanguine in hope that
something might turn up at any moment
to his advantage

  he had no idea of buying his own life
with the peacock for he knew that the
image might yet prove of tremendous aid
to sefid and he was content to leave it
thus to her the news that there seemed
to be no pursuit of the yezidi which he
speedily confirmed by talking with his
guards was a cause of greater worry to
him he had hoped desperately-even as
he knew sefid must be hoping-that tahir
beg would come hammering at the penji-
van valleys with all the hamavands and
the jaf tribes following him also he had
hoped that his father would be with the
greajt kurd for he believed his father to
be still alive

  was tahir beg then dead had pur-
suit been abandoned it seemed incred-
ible yet the dwellers in the valleys below
the penjivan rock were on guard and had
seen no sign of any foes the kurds had
attempted no pursuit of the victorious raid-
ers the racial hatred between kurd and
yezidi a hatred centuries old seemed
stunned ino quiescence

  bob fraser found no great beauty of
architecture in the palace through which
he was conducted it was built massively
of beams fetched from the mountain slopes
but the old stone-flagged floors showed that
it had been reared upon some ancient site
if it was not elegant however it was ex-
tremely luxurious and the rich rugs of
sharizur now carpeted its floors and added
to its beauty the palace was built about
one huge central hall which he rightly
judged to be used by a hudr on state
occasions

  fraser was conducted to rooms in the
rear of the palace which he was informed
were his these he found were part of
an enclosed area which included a portion
the brazen peacock

of the gardens and which were continually
under guard-either of black slaves or of
persian mercenaries when he reached his
destination writing materials were brought
him and he wrote out a letter to tahir
beg as agreed upon which his guard took
over and presumably delivered to al hudr
for forwarding

   this finished fraser indulged in the lux-
ury of a bath was wined and dined by a
slave who had been appointed to wait upon
him and presently feeling more contented
with his lot lighted his pipe and sauntered
forth into the gardens

   its a gilded prison all right he re-
flected but it might be a heap worse
those cages along the wall for instance-
ugh for the present theres no great
danger sefid is safe until the month is
over and that will be another three weeks
in the meantime if al hudr does not dis-
cover that she has the peacock i can hope
for something to turn up escape may not
be so hopeless-

lje was thinking thus when turning a

	 bend in the path that wound through
this prisoned portion of the gardens he
came plump upon shaik nuri who was
standing there gazing at the ground in an
attitude of despondent melancholy the
bandage was gone from his head but his
arm still lay in its sling gone too were
the numerous weapons that had formerly
adorned his person that he also was a
prisoner was not hard to guess

   shaik nuri lifted his head and gazed at
fraser who had halted to his surprise
bob fraser found in those sensual and
cruel features no blaze of animosity or
hatred only despair was stamped in them
-it came to him swiftly that this young
shaik was a broken man for a long mo-
ment the two gazed steadily at each other

  you are agha farizur said the shaik
dully a gleam stirred in his eyes ah
would that i had fallen fighting beneath
the hamavand bullets ere i had been
snared in the nets of this accursed wor-
shiper of shaitan would that i had slain
you in the courtyard there at erbil or been
slain ere i had listened to the lying prom-
ises of this persian infidel 

   despite the evil soul of the young shaik
despite that it was shaik nuri who was
primarily responsible for all that had hap-
pened to himself and to sefid through send-
ing al hudr to steal the girl and the brazen
peacock fraser could not but feel a twinge

the blue

of pity as he looked at the broken chief-
tain this free lord of the hills had been
ensnared in the gins of a more subtle and
powerful man and had been ruthlessly cast
aside

  you are a prisoner then said fraser
i thought you were allied with al
hudr-

  for the first time a flash of hatred
lighted the despondent features

  what is honor to an infidel broke out
nuri bitterly because i desired the
white pearl whom he took from me
this unspeakable dog has kept me prisoned
and has scattered my men among his dog-
brethren weak as i had become ie feared
me may the tomb of his father be broken
into by jackals and you nazarene you
are a prisoner likewise

  yes said bob fraser with a shrug
i know now shaik nuri why you wanted
that brazen peacock in the caravansary at
erbil you recognized it as the god of
these infidels

  the other nodded gloorrffly and dis-
missed the subject as of no importance

  i shall never see sulaimanieh again or
the wide plain of sharizur or the fertile
azmir hills  there was no whine to the
young chieftains voice only a note of
plaintive mourning as of one who sees his
own fate very clearly and shuns it not
and you will sit in my place my uncle
kadir-you the wily old fox of our family
supported by the rifles of the englishmen
truly said the poet palangani i see in the
white beauty of women the ruin of princes
and the pallor of death and in their red
lips the flaming of cities 

eraser forebore to remind the other

	that it was not the beauty of sefid
which had led him to this strait but his
own unbridled passions

  in the name of allah the compassion-
ate cease your lamentations exclaimed
fraser impatiently you are in no dan-
ger shaik-

  the other smiled-an indescribable smile
pregnant with hidden things

  you know little of this al hudr oh
nazarene he fears me and he hate me
therefore has he condemned me to death
within eight days

  to death exclaimed fraser with some
incredulity while there are a hundred
of your men here- 

  the other made a gesture that did not
lack pride
book magazine



  what are a hundred warriors among
his hundreds they will not see me again
for unless i abandon the true god and pro-
claim belief in this accursed melek taus
he has sworn to slay me to win his faith
a shaik of sulaimanieh would be good for-
tune in his hand eh but never will i spit
upon the faith of my fathers as they
would have me never will i deny allah
and turn to the worship of shaitan the ac-
cursed look to your own case nazarene
for i think that he will give you the same
choice ere long

  shaik nuri abruptly turned away and
disappeared among the enclosed gardens

  reflecting often on this meeting during
the days that followed fraser concluded
that only the existence of the brazen pea-
cock had saved him from this same choice
there had been naught to save shaik nuri
who had fallen horribly into the pit of
his own digging after egregiously trick-
ing his ally after leaving him to the mercy
of tahir beg after taking out of his very
hand the white pearl the lord of penjivan
was too crafty to free so potential a foe
yet could he exhibit a man of this rank
and fame as a convert to melek taus he
might be well content it was not for
nofiiing however that the shaiks of su-
laimanieh were notorious for their bigoted
and fanatical adherence to islam and fra-
ser knew that this young chieftain would
never apostatize

  through the following days fraser was
not allowed to leave his apartment or the
portion of the gardens allotted to him
shaik nuri did not again appear nor did
he see anyone with the exception of the
two guards who remained in his rooms day
and night these who were changed
thrice daily were members of al hudrs
personal following they displayed no an-
imosity toward fraser but treated him
much as one of themselves whiling the
time away with song and story

  nothing had been heard of tahir beg
or the jaf tribes and they taunted bob
fraser good-humoredly that his friends had
left him with the white pearl to the mercy
of al hudr into whose territory they dared
not follow this seemed true enough and
worried him greatly the most probable
explanation was that his father and tahir
beg were both dead

t tpon the eighth evening after his meet-
 ing with shaik nuri he was abruptly
summoned forth by his guards who fas-

by h bedford-jones

tened golden fetters upon his wrists and led
him out into the audience hall here he
found a great company assembled includ-
ing al hudrs mercenaries and the chief
men of the yezidis upon a dais at the
upper end of the hall whither he was con-
ducted by his guards sat uthman in per-
son and beside him couched amid gor-
geous silken carpets was sefid

  for a moment the eyes of sefid and
fraser met in that brief meeting fraser
read that she had come to no hurt he
smiled slightly and she answered the smile
with a very slight gesture that brought
sudden hope into his heart then he
turned-and saw shaik nuri standing be-
tween two guards facing al hudr

  do you still prefer islam to the wor-
ship of melek taus demanded the chief-
tain who was noted among his warriors
for not wasting words

  there is but one god and mohammed
is the prophet of god intoned shaik nuri
proudly accursed be shaitan 

  a growl rippled and eddied through the
ranks of the yezidis but with a leap al
hudr sprang to his feet and drew his
curved scimetar-a blade that shimmered
with jewels in the light of the lamps over-
head and when they saw this from all
his men went up a long howl of delight

  loose him and give him the best blade
among you cried al hudr throwing off
his long green cloak now summon al-
lah to your aid infidel for you will have
need of him stay-since your right arm
is useless mine shall also be tied here
lave

  summoning the nearest slave al hudr
had his own right arm tied about his waist
at this touch of romantic chivalry the
watching crowd howled anew but fraser
noting how al hudr balanced the scimetar
in his left hand guessed that the chieftain
could use either arm with equal skill

  shaik nuri did not shrink from the
measuring of swords standing forth with
the blade that had been given him he
lifted the steel and cried aloud

  allah allahu akhbar the compas-
sionate great is god the merciful

  a thin smile curved the cruel lips of al
hudr

  by the hidden name of melek taus-
azazill he shouted and leaped forward

  the two blades met in midair-met and
clashed clashed again the young shaik
seemed transmuted by the touch of a
weapon he flung himself upon al hudr in
the brazen peacock

a passionate fury attacking with fire an
elan that drew roars of admiration from
the crowd for an instant it seemed that
he would bear down the older man by the
sheer frenzy of his onrush a hudr gave
never a stroke back but devoted himself
to upbuilding his flaming blade into a wall
impenetrable

  then suddenly a hudrs glittering steel
licked out like a flash of light so swift
so sudden and terrible was the blow that
few saw it but the chieftain leaped back-
ward and his voice pealed up in a shrill
yell of mockery

  ho infidel where is your allah
now

  shaik nuri stood motionless an instant
-then a great sigh seemed to burst from
him and he collapsed in a red heap
with its single blow that razor-edged steel
had shorn into his life and had bitten him
half asunder

a wild roar of voices filled the huge
hall-a roar of wolfish applause a
roar of mad acclaim for the greatest and
most terrible swordsman of them all
none of the sulaimanieh men were present
apparently indeed fraser later learned
that ten of them had been put to death
that morning and that under this example
the others had consented to embrace melek
taus but they were not brought to see
the death of shaik nuri for a hudr was
by no means desirous of goading his mer-
cenaries into vengeance and bloodfeuds

  before the uproar had quieted down
and while a hudr was cleansing his
weapon upon a cloth offered by a slave
there came a surge and wave of the bodies
filling the hall through the crowd broke
an officer who flung himself toward a
hudr with a shout the chieftain roared
at the crowd for quiet and as a curious
hush fell the words of the officer came
clearly to fraser

  lord a nazarene alone and unarmed
has been sent on from the lower valleys
and has been brought through the outer
city to our gates

  a nazarene a prisoner

  not so lord he has come of his own
will according to his tale he is the slave
and servant of agha farizur and has come
hither to serve him in his captivity
fraser listened startled and incredulous
it occurred to him that tahir beg must
have sent someone-yet that were impos-
sible if this arrival was a nazarene

the blue

  a hudr glanced at his captive and all
eyes followed his he frowned then a thin
smile curved his lips

  bring the man here he said but
first search him well who can this be
agha fraser when we were in the coun-
try of the hamavands you had no slave

  who it is i know not answered fra-
ser helpless

  down the length of the hall a lane was
opened and presently everyone craned for-
ward eagerly for christians were not seen
every day in penjivan-unless under com-
pulsion no less eager than the rest bob
fraser rose on his toes when he saw the
man who was striding up the hall amid
guards a low word of astonishment broke
from him instantly a hudr was at his
side

  you know this infidel demanded the
persian softly

  fraser nodded unbelieving his own
senses he-he has served me all my
life and my father he lifted his voice
suddenly winkler is that really you

yyinkler for it was none other
 halted and stared around before
him was the red mass that had been shaik
nuri and he whitened perceptibly then
his gaze fell upon the figure of fraser and
a glad cry burst from him

  mr robert tell these heathen that
its all right sir-

  eagerly fraser turned to a hudr and
spoke in persian

  this man speaks the truth uthman
how he came here i know not unless he
came to this land with my father send
him away again i pray you and do him
no hurt-

  a hudr merely made an impatient ges-
ture and stepped forward toward winkler
who met him with a blank stare the
chieftain smiled slowly and spoke in
kurdish

  whom seek you here nazarene

  fraser was even more surprised when he
heard winkler break into slow and diffi-
cult kurdish yet manage to make himself
understood winkler told a plain and un-
varnished tale-how he had been with
tahir beg and howard z fraser when
word came to them that sefid and bob had
been taken prisoner how pursuit beyond
the vale of sharizur had been futile how
he had set out with certain companions
who had later deserted him and how he
had made his way to penjivan in the face
book magazine	by h bedford-jones



of many difficulties in order to serve his
master it was a long tale and not quickly
told

  to those who heard it this quixotic
fidelity of servant to master was not only
perfectly understandable but it was thor-
oughly admirable obviously winkler
was frightened and it was equally obvious
that he intended to do his duty at all
costs al hudr questioned him regarding
the movements of tahir beg but winkler
knew only that he had placed howard z
fraser in safe hands and had then set forth
to find bob so transparent was his devo-
tion that al hudr could not but believe
his tale to eastern minds here was the
perfect servant

  let it be as you wish said the chief-
tain with a shrug you shall remain with
agha fraser and serve him his fate shall
be your fate and his luck your luck

  so be it answered winkler quite un-
ruffled by the implied threat

  if i had such slaves as this infidel naz-
arene quoth al hudr gazing fiercely
about the hall melek taus would be
lord of persia and rumistan itself take
agha fraser to his quarters and send the
servant with him

chapter xiii

    a servant is to call the people saying
  it is the call of the prophet to a feast-
  the book al jilwah

elieved of his golden fetters bob
fraser was returned to his own
quarters as though in a dream he
shook hands with winkler for a moment
words were beyond him

  good heavens winkler he exclaimed
at last it doesnt seem possible that
youre here in the flesh man its like a
piece out of the arabian nights-to think
of you coming all through these hills by
yourself-

  but i didnt sir broke in winkler
smiling

  you didnt why you just told them
you did-that was what made the big hit
with al hudr-the faithful-servant stuff
and all that-

  yes sir winkler permitted himself a
grin much of the old formality of winkler
had vanished adventuring had largely
effaced his dignified placidity

  your father and tahir beg felt con-
vinced that this was the story to tell mr

robert they brought me as far as the
first penjivan valley-

  they brought you repeated fraser
staring at him in astonishment then-
why you old rascal was that story of
yours all a pack of lies

  just about sir you see we knew
that you were here and miss sefid too so
it was necessary that you be reached in
some way when i suggested that i come
openly tahir beg was delighted he seemed
to think that these heathen would consider
it quite the thing to do just as they did
so i came but-the things ive seen mr
robert that dead man in the hall-and
to imagine that these heathen actually
worship satan sir-

  never mind all that winkler youre a
genius-a hero coming here to this place
by yourself in a perfectly calm assur-
ance-

  i beg your pardon sir but it was noth-
ing of the sort put in winkler i was
scared out of my skin all the time i as-
sure you

 damned if you showed it then
roared fraser delightedly clapping him on
the back bully for you say what
does it all mean anyhow wheres dad
all this time why hasnt tahir beg done
a thing to rescue his daughter

  winkler glanced around cautiously one
of the guards was at the outer door watch-
ing them but he had no knowledge of the
english speech

  its like this sir answered winkler
lowering his voice your father had been
hurt-nothing serious but some contu-
sions-

  yes sefid told me about that go on
and most fortunately i happened to
meet him and brought him to tahir
beg-

  you were you knocking around on
private adventures of your own

yinkler looked a trifle agitated
 well sir ill come to that later
its more important just now to tell you
whats what we met tahir beg and then
found that to pursue this al hudr directly
would gain very little tahir beg and your
father met the leaders of the jaf tribes
who were most happy to go into partner-
ship with them so to speak against these
heathen sir

  they worked out a scheme by which
most of the jaf troops were to take their
time and then to attack the lower penjivan
the brazen peacock

the blue

 valleys at a given day to break through
 those valleys was impossible according to
 the best accounts so your father took
 charge of things there while tahir beg
 with a few hundred picked men set off to
 circle around through the mountains he
 had guides who could bring him on the
 penjivan country from the rear where no
 attack was thought possible because of the
 mountains-and hell break out suddenly
 close to this city sir this will so alarm
 the lower valleys that your father may
 break in there and while theyre doing
 that we are to set fire to the city here-
 whoa exclaimed fraser laughing
 look here winkler-do you still read
 those dime novels you used to devour in
 the old days

   eh why yes sir-

   well youre making yourself into a
 regular bloodthirsty old pirate chief arent
 you weve no matches but that doesnt
 matter we can kill a few dozen of the best

	fighters in kurdistan and set fire to the
 outer city and maybe knock out al hudr
 as we go along-huh winkler im sur-
 prised at you 

    well sir im only going by what your
 father and tahir beg said answered
 winkler doggedly according to them
 mr robert there would be no chance
 whatever in a straight attack the only
 hope was to attack unexpectedly land a
 big surprise when tahir beg got in from
 the rear and then put over the finishing
 blow by making them think that enemies
 were in the very city itself theyre de-
 pending on us to do it sir

   fraser sobered all right winkler
 well not fail em i dont know just what
 we can do but well see when is this at-
 tack to take place

   whenever tahir beg can get through
 the mountains sir he left camp a week
 ago-how long it will be i cant say
 fraser whistled well its a gay life
 never mind tell me about dad

    until late that night the two sat up talk-
 ing and for the first time fraser heard of
 how and why his father had come to kur-
 distan and of all that had happened since
 his coming in return he was able to give
 a coherent understanding of things to
 winkler who was very hazy regarding the
 yezidis and all that had happened wink-
 ler in fact had been under the impression
 that he had come into a land of wild
 maniacs and the barbaric splendor of al
 hudr had quite dazzled him



it pon the following day al hudr him-
 self paid a brief visit to frasers quar-
ters evidently to assure himself that
winklers story was true the chieftain was
in affable mood and paid more attention to
winkler with whom he seemed delighted
than to fraser to the latter he merely
said that nothing had been heard from the
messengers as yet

 youve made a hit with the chief
chucklfed fraser when their visitor had de-
parted tahir beg had a wise hunch all
right when he said that the faithful-serv-
ant business would go over strong stick
to it old boy hello whos this

  their guards had been changed during
the visit of al hudr now that the chief-
tain had departed one of the warriors
promptly settled down against the door
and went to sleep the other however ap-
proached fraser and winkler he was a
total stranger

i have a message for you agha fraser
you do not remember me of course
no said fraser regarding him sharply
i was one of shaik nuris men-it was
i who guarded you there upon the road
when we captured you

 oh then you are one of the apos-
tates-

  the man flushed darkly peace agha
in the name of allah he said his voice
thick we are brought to shame all of
us our life is become as bitterness and we
live but to put a knife into this accursed
infidel al hudr and send him unto hell

i would have done it now except that i
had a message for you-and the slaying
would have meant your death also

  what is your message asked fraser
coldly not quite believing the man

  this agha it was given to me by an-
other of our comrades what it is i know
not

 from an inner pocket of his kurdish
vest the guard produced a folded paper
fraser took it and went to a window he
opened the paper and found it to be a let-
ter in persian

   in the name of god the compassionate
  greeting to agha fraser from the white
  pearl

   those two hamavand men who were cap-
  tured with us have been given me as slaves
  they are bold men and are in touch with the
  men of sulaimanieh also i received the
  brazen peacock and shall use it at the feast
  tomorrow night at which you are to be
  present al hudr has promised to admit
  you as a guest

   leave all to me we shall win or lose
book magazine

  everything when i stand up that is the
  signal join me swiftly and do not hesitate to
  obey me

  fraser stared at the writing in joyful
amazement it was the first he had heard
from sefid since their capture the first in-
timation he had had that she was alive and
well he turned and called winkler to
him and translated the writing

  theres a woman for you winkler he
exclaimed instead of being overcome by
her position she has gone to work and
means to do something if i had half her
spirit-

  winkler gave him a shrewd glance then
smiled faintly

  do you think sir that what she means
to do can interfere with tahir begs
plans

  i cant tell of course but i cant see
how perhaps she has found some means
of escape-its evident that she and the
two hamavand men have gone to work on
those fellows from sulaimanieh perhaps
this guard of ours knows whats up if
he could get a note to her telling about
the outside situation-

  fraser beckoned the guard who joined
them at once

   this letter is from her who is called the
white pearl he said quietly can you
place an answer in her hands

  impossible agha said the other
promptly i know not whom to trust nor
how to get the letter to her most of our
comrades have sworn to slay a hudr but
some of them have been won over by bribes
of women and gold so that it were folly to
trust them

  what is intended tomorrow night at
the feast

the kurd shook his head agha i
know not that there is to be a feast
i know and many of us have received
word to hold ourselves ready to act at that
time what is intended however has not
come to us nor do we know whom to
trust

  very well fraser reluctantly aban-
doned the hope of getting any word to
sefid it would be too apt to frustrate all
her own plans if discovered he swiftly
determined to trust this kurd fully

  i can tell you this-that certain of
your kinsmen the jafs are waiting to
drop upon the city from the rear and at-
tack if there is any fighting tomorrow
night set fire to the palace and to all other

by h bedford-jones



  buildings you or your comrades can reach
you understand

  a flash of fierce joy gleamed in the fea-
tures of the man

  unto allah be glory he answered fer-
vently i understand agha it shall be
done now be careful-that dog yonder
is stirring and i do not think they trust
me too well-

  the kurd hastily returned to the side of
his comrade and flung himself down as
though lazily watching the prisoners

  i beg your pardon sir said winkler
uneasily but on thinking over this affair
i am not so sure that i like it im afraid
miss sefid has determined to do something
desperate now if you could make her
wait until tahir beg comes-

  fraser turned and put both hands on
winklers shoulders meeting the mans
eyes squarely

  my dear winkler he said tahir beg
may never come how on earth he can get
around and through those mountains
which are inhabited by wild folk friendly
to a hudr without giving any warning is
more than i can see perhaps he can do it
more likely he cant

  were in a precarious situation here apt
to be slaughtered at any moment but
sefid is in far greater peril than we-and
she has more brains than i have to inter-
fere with anything she has planned would
be folly

  but mr robert what can she have
planned persisted the puzzled winkler
escape-

  i dont know and i dont care broke
in fraser laughing were at the end of
our rope winkler any day those messen-
gers may return with news that they cant
find tahir beg-which means that a hudr
would string me up gladly the chances
are theyve been bagged by my father and
the jafs and when the yezidis find that
the messengers are slain a hudr is going
to give me a bath in boiling oil or some
such pleasantry now if sefid has framed
up something well swing in with her and
help turn the trick thats all so no more
growling old friend-tomorrow night will
show

  very well sir said winkler stifling a
sigh may i ask sir whether this miss
sefid wears trousers like most of these
women

  she does winkler-in a perfectly
adorable fashion and old man were
going to be married
the brazen peacock	the blue



    inkler gulped then does she
    -er-know it yet sir

  fraser grinned delightedly winkler
youre all right no she doesnt suspect
it yet what dyou think dad will say
when i tell him

  i will venture a guess sir after i have
seen the lady i regret that i was too much
stirred by emotion when i arrived to no-
tice anything-

  arent you congratulating me
winkler gazed reflectively at him for a
moment no sir you must remember
that i have not yet seen her-and i believe
she is a heathen sir-

  fraser flushed then broke into laughter
confound you i always knew you had
enough backbone to serve a camel old
sport well you take a good look at her
tomorrow night and heathen or not if
you dont congratulate me ill miss my
guess besides ill let you try your hand
at converting her before were married

  a faint smile broke winklers impas-
sivity

  thank you mr robert-but id rather
not try anything of the sort if i may
say so sir i think the whole affair is de-
cidedly in bad taste

  with this dry pronouncement winkler
departed into the adjoining chamber for a
bath fraser gazed after him half frown-
ing a trifle startled by the attitude of his
companion it was undeniably true that
sefid was an adherent of islam-

  confound it what do i care mut-
tered fraser if she were the queen of
china id still think her the most glorious
woman living and therell be some way
out of it all-theres sure to be just at
present the chances are that well never live
long enough to talk of marrying so why
bother trouble now but what the devil
did he mean was in bad taste-talking
about sefid or my meaning to marry her
youre a deep one all right ill bet dad
is missing you a whole lot right now

  with the following day one of the giant
black eunuchs called on fraser with word
that his attendance at a banquet that
evening was ordered by al hudr and that
if he desired silk robes for the occasion
they would be furnished fraser refused
having no mind to part with his soiled and
tattered uniform-the last link left to him
with the outer world

  the day dragged he saw no more of
his friend the sulaimanian from the per-
sians who guarded him he found that al

hudr was giving the feast that evening in
honor of the white pearl certain fast
days were provided by the yezidi faith but
as a rule this month of the new year was
celebrated with song and feast there was
little that was gloomy in their religion
neither fraser nor winkler had a wea-
pon of any description they were en-
tirely ignorant of the plan sefid had in
mind but fraser knew the girl well enough
to impress upon winkler the necessity of
instant obedience

  well have to join her the instant she
gives us the signal by standing up he
said and then well have to waste no time
talking whatever she says to do we must
do i imagine she does not know of your
presence yet

  you dont think she will actually start
a row sir

  if she does were all done for as far
as i can see admitted fraser but if
she does then grab anything handy and hit
everyone in sight theres no telling what
that girl will have the nerve to spring and
i mean to back her up to the limit ac-
cording to all i can screw out of the
guards shes been laying low and fooling
al hudr into thinking that shes friendly
and complaisant to his wishes and if so
i imagine shell have a big surprise in store
for him she has brains winkler 

  so i have understood sir murmured
winkler drily

chapter xiv

    watch well if ye can read the heart of
  a woman for there is no guile like unto her
  guile-al barani

well might uthman al hudr feel
pride in himself and his achieve-
ments as he stood in his audience
hall that night and welcomed his guests
down the length of the hall were set long
tables laden with viands which were ac-
counted choice for penjivan and with wines
which the yezidi religion did not forbid
from many sources had come the dishes of
gold and copper bronze and brass and sil-
ver even the china which covered the ta-
bles from the same sources had come the
rich carpets underfoot the rare gigim and
turkoman broideries along the walls the
clusters of ancient arms and armor that
upbore the lights

  at the head of the tables was the pea-
cock throne or rather couch that had been
book magazine

fashioned for sefid not for al hudr had
this been done regal chieftain though he
was he and his men partook of the rough
equality of the mountain folk and he made
no pretense to rule by any grace other
than the strength of his own arm-which
was quite sufficient for sefid however
he had provided his best it was a rather
crude representation of a peacock facing
the tables the body serving as cushioned
seat the tail outspread above and behind
it was symbolic of melek taus of course
as sefids name was to the yezidis a symbol
of creation and awed murmurs came from
the yezidi leaders who arrived in the hall

  al hudr had emptied all his coffers to
hang that barbaric seat with jewels until
the thing glittered and glimmered with
radiant fires and he had done so gladly
never had it occurred to him to ask sefids
opinion tn the matter of the marriage to
him as to all the yezidis he had captured
her-and therefore she was his

  sefid herself had done much to encour-
age this impression knowing how futile
were any reluctance or refusal she had
assumed a passive role ever greeting al
hudr friendly wise and allowing him in
his overweening pride and arrogance to
draw his own conclusions she was a
woman and she had only womans weapons
with which to fight therefore she used
them relentlessly and terribly -

  when she came through the doorway be-
hind the peacock and stepped forward a
mighty shout of acclaim arose from the
crowded hall and al hudr joined in it as
he came forward to welcome her and lead
her to her seat she was clad plainly and
simply in white the golden shimmering
crown of her hair casting a glory about her
face from the passionate eagerness of al
hudr she shrank a trifle then placed her
hand in his and smiled at sight of the
peacock throne her eyes widened amaz-
edly al hudr looked into those eyes of
deepest blue speckled like richest lazuli
with gold and laughed in delight of her
as though to set off her beauty by contrast
with his own garb he wore only his usual
persian chain mail beneath his mantle

  welcome to the white pearl he said
gravely see melek taus awaits his be-
loved i shall sit at your feet and wor-
ship beauteous one-

  no she broke in standing beside the
peacock to survey the place no al
hudr sit yonder at the tables facing me
so that i may see you 

by h bedford-jones



at this arose great laughter for the
speech was taken to be the naive
words of a girl drunk with proud love of
her future lord in this sense too al
hudr understood her and seeing her con-
fusion before all the folk he broke into
soft laughter and assented

  as you wish white pearl name then
my seat and i shall rejoice in your eyes
sefid indicated a seat that was some dis-
tance away but facing her-a seat from
which al hudr could not easily come to
the peacock throne by reason of the ta-
bles between to this seat the chieftain
went and gaily lifted a winecup toward
her and drank

  thus the feast began while there was
much music of yezidi timbrels and kurdish
flutes and wine ran freely

  sefid sitting upon her peacock throne
and gazing across the crowded hall was
very pale with realization of what was to
happen here by her plotting the great
mass of folk were yezidis both men and
women all of al hudrs persian and kurd-
ish warriors were here also save those
watching at the outer gates and walls and
many of their wives likewise behind the
feasters were slaves-huge black men
dumb eunuchs many girls dancers and
wine servers and others at either side of
the peacock throne stood the two hama-
vand men who served sefid as slaves and
this night their eyes were glittering with
strange fires

  among the throng too were many of al
hudrs men whose eyes were fastened upon
sefid with the same glittering intensity-
men who had once worn the long garments
of sulaimanieh men who had served the
dead shaik nuri and would serve him
still sefid smiled as she met their eyes
and there was something terrible in her
smile-but her face softened when she saw
bob fraser at one of the nearer tables
watching her when she smiled at him
her eyes were alight with a merry greet-
ing then she saw the man who stood be-
hind and served him

  she turned to one of her faithful hama-
vand men frowning

  who is that man serving agha fraser
is he not a nazarene find out for me
the hamavand called one of the blacks
who was passing and sefid questioned the
slave she found what was known about
winkler and nodded that winkler had
come as a messenger from her father or
from frasers father she did not doubt
the brazen peacock

  good she said in kurdish to the
hamavands that will mean another
helper-good tahir beg has had some
hand in his presence here brethren

  the two hamavands looked at each
other and laughed fiercely

  for this night of gaiety a hudr had
called into play all his resources and as the
wine flowed more freely the abandon of the
entertainment was increased the num-
bers of the musicians were swelled party
after party of dancing girls filled the side
courts or threaded their way among the
tables-now luring the feasters with se-
ductive half-clad dances of the harem now
masked and costumed in grotesque bar-
barity between the dances men fought
with scimetar or knife fought in wild ex-
hibitions of swordsmanship that brought
the wine-maddened feasters to their feet in
frenzied acclamations

dresently one of the hamavands

	leaned toward sefid

  it is time white pearl it is time the
wine is in mens heads by now-even those
sulaimanians are drinking may allah re-
quite them the shame presently one of
them will have drunk too much-

  sefid nodded quickly understanding the
danger she flashed a look at fraser who
had drunk little-a look of warning that he
did not lose

  very well she answered go to a
hudr and tell him to command silence for
i have something to say

  the hamavand lingered an instant
give me your permission to stay by his
side sefid he breathed quickly then
i will have my knife through him ere-
she flashed him an angry glance that
made him straighten up

  have i not said that i am no assassin
she returned heatedly the man is no
coward and shall not have a cowards fate
if it is the will of god that he should
fall among the others let him fall if not
let him fight clear of them

  if he does that lady then we are lost
said the hamavand

  better be lost with honor than win by
cowards blows she retorted you have
your own work to do if you are unwilling
to do it then say so and i will arrange
otherwise 

  we obey sefid said the man hum-
bly enough and departed

  he made his way toward a hudr who
although flushed with wine had not ceased

the blue



to watch sefid and who guessed that a
message was coming to him he received
her bidding with a nod then came to his
feet and uttered a shout that brought im-
mediate silence the hamavand was al-
ready on his way back to the side of
sefid

  peace cried out a hudr his voice
vibrating through the hall the white
pearl wishes to speak peace and let no
man speak until she has finished

  silence fell and through the hall cer-
tain men sat up straighter and watched
sefid with glittering intent gaze

  she did not rise however but for a mo-
ment looked straight at a hudr perhaps
in that moment she was regretting all that
she had planned justifiable though it might
be perhaps the sight of this splendid bar-
barian lord of the unconquered hills
stirred a womanly hesitation in her if so
the hesitation vanished when she glanced
at fraser and met his frowning eyes

  children of yezid she said her voice
lifting clearly through the hall it is known
to all of you that i am named the white
pearl and you have been told that melek
taus whom you worship has sent me to
be the bride of your chief is this not so
a murmur of assent passed through the
gathering all eyes were fastened upon
her in fascination and curious wonderment
she smiled slightly

  whether melek taus has sent me i do
not know she went on a sudden note of
bitterness in her voice but if that be so
then he has no love for you i say this
because i am not come here of my own
will and because i am not minded to
marry any man-least of all that a hudr
yonder look at this all of you know
you what it is

  so saying she placed upon the peacocks
head the brazen image of melek taus

an instant of silence followed then as
the thing was recognized a low breath
of awe and wonder stirred through the
crowd a hudr staring at sefid from in-
credulous eyes uttered a hoarse cry which
put into words the murmur of the others

it is melek taus-the sacred image-
aye cried out sefid her voice ring-
ing shrill and high as she came to her feet
it is melek taus who comes to warn you
of danger and death-

  nalat shaitan accursed be satan
pealed forth a wild cry in the center of
the hall uprose one of the men of sulai-
book magazine



manieh his knife flamed high and was
buried in the throat of the nearest yezidi

  al hudr leaped forth but a man tripped
him another plunged at him as he fell
striving to thrust keen steel through the
persians chain-mail from the doors
pierced the death-shriek of a guard and a
rifle-shot banged out

  then when it was thought that al hudr
was slain wild terror rushed through the
hall none knew what had happened or
what enemy had come and as one by one
men struck down the hanging lamps all
that place became a seething whirlpool of
horror in which every man fought against
his neighbor and strove to escape nor
though presently the voice of al hudr rose
again did terror cease for by now the
lights were dashed away and darkness and
death ruled hideously

  in vain men strove to burst through the
doors they had been barred from outside
there was fighting outside also-certain of
the sulaimanieh men had scattered to
spread fire and death in the outer city ere
they themselves were slain within the
palace every man smote out into the blind-
ness around him and mad panic sent the
hot reek of blood drifting in air

  when he saw sefid come leaping to her
feet bob fraser had sprung forward to
gain her side he had a brief glimpse of
winkler at his heels and of the two ham-
avand men striking out at those around
when he joined her sefid clutching his
hand swiftly cried to follow her and
plunged into the doorway behind the pea-
cock throne

  none will follow yet she panted out
as the curtains fell upon the frightful place
behind them the hamavands will hold
the doorway-come quickly we will meet
no one this way-we must seize upon al
hudrs tower and hold it until they come
to help-

  entirely at a loss to guess the meaning
of her words but pausing for no questions
fraser found himself hard put to it to keep
the pace she set swift as a deer she ran
with sure knowledge of the way and in a
moment more fraser found that they were
out of the building and in the gardens

  there winkler he called over his
shoulder

  right behind sir came the answer

  faster  breathed sefid quickening her
pace

fraser sprinted marveling at her swift-
ness down the garden paths she ran as

by h bedford-jones

though she knew every inch of them-so
indeed she did for this had been her study
during the past days-and behind them
died out the clamor from the palace yet
fraser was aware of a new clamor farther
away and a murky glare that was flicker-
ing in the night he laughed harshly as
he caught up with sefid

   the sulaimanians have fired the city
 he panted exultantly i told them-if
 there was trouble-to fire everything pos-
 sible-

   good she answered with a tinkle of
 laughter that was vibrant with excitement
 we are almost at the tower now-there
 it looms ahead there is no guard you
 must get a light quickly and find rifles-

defore them grew up blackly a queer
structure fraser remembered to have
seen it from his own secluded comer of the
gardens but its purpose he did not know
it was a small perfectly round tower that
now seemed to be of tremendously massive
structure rising thirty feet in air all
around it for the space of a hundred yards
or more the garden was given over to a
network of shallow basins filled with water
from a fountain before the door

   fraser was about to plunge directly at
 the tower water or not when sefid sharply
 restrained him

   follow me there is a path-

   she darted ahead running between the
 winding curvatures of the water pursuing
 some unseen pathway which led to the
  doorway of the tower the door proved to
 be a massive affair of iron propped open
 by an iron bar

   do not touch it cried the girl-as
 fraser paused when that is removed
 the door will close of itself wait until the
 others join us-

   matches winkler demanded fraser
 coming to a halt ive none

   here are some sir said winkler the
 imperturbable perhaps id better remain
 here sir to keep watch-

   light the lamps inside commanded
sefid hurry

   fraser headed into the obscurity struck
 a match and glanced around directly
 before him he saw a large brass lamp set
 upon a standard sefid snatched it open
 and he brought the match to the wick it
 proved to be full of oil for the wick
 burned steadily when sefid clashed the
 door of the lamp shut fraser saw that it
 was cunningly contrived ta light the room
the brazen peacock

 around yet to leave the doorway in dark-
 ness

  this is al hudrs tower said the girl
quickly he built it for himself as a
place of refuge-or rather rebuilt it for
it was an ancient structure before he came
here here he keeps rifles and arms of all
kinds there is a secret passage leading to
it from the palace but i broke the lock of
the secret door before i went to the feast
and he cannot use it the pools of water
are all around so that men cannot get up
to the walls very quickly-

  fraser was already getting rifles from
the racks which ranged one side of the
wall with each rifle was a filled bandolier
of cartridges

  there are food and water stored in the
room above went on the girl and i think
another passage leads off somewhere among
the gardens-but i am not sure-

  her voice failed

  fraser turned quickly to her thinking
she was about to faint but she shook her
head and smiled slightly she was very
pale

  no im all right-its just that-that
-oh so many men are dying this minute
but i had to do it there was no other way
-and if al hudr is killed i can make them
obey me with this-

  she snatched the brazen peacock from
her bosom and threw it down shuddering
as she did so

chapter xv

   a hurricane of fire and sword will i bring
   upon the idolaters who shall be swallowed
   up by their own wickedness-the koran

r l hey wanted to assassinate him but
 i would not allow it said sefid
x more quietly he is too brave a
a man for that-and yet unless he dies
by their steel we are lost shaik nuris
men will cause much blood and fire this
night and few of them will escape few of
them want to escape after having denied
their faith but i hope the two hama-
vand men reach here safely-

  she broke off and glided to the doorway
fraser joined her there wondering at the
brave soul within her which had revolted
against the bloodshed yet which had car-
ried through the plan unfalteringly-the
soul which based all hopes on the death of
al hudr yet which could not stoop to his
assassination

the blue



  allah be good to you sefid he said
softly catching her hand and drawing it
to his lips you are a true daughter of
tahir beg-ah i wonder if he is close
enough to see this fire and to take advan-
tage of it

  as sefid turned to him in surprise he
swiftly related the news borne by winkler
even now it might be tahir beg and his
riders were waiting to drop out of the hills
upon the doomed city of the shaitan
parasts

  it may be it may be  exclaimed sefid
excitement blazing in her face remem-
ber my father is an aorami-he knows
these mountains and all the folk in them
and the hidden trails if al hudr is slain
then the yezidis will obey me-

  obey you questioned fraser

  yes-because the brazen peacock is
their god and is here with me al hudr
would guess that t had a hand in the plot
yonder the yezidis would think otherwise
-did i not tell them that i had come to
give them warning they are so full of
superstition that if al hudr is dead i can
make them believe anything i say but he
has many secret ways about the palace and
i am afraid that he will escape-

  fraser glanced about the tower cham-
ber a ladder ran to the room above and
to the roof the stone walls were solid
without a break-yet he remembered what
sefid had said about the secret passages

  if there are hidden ways of reaching
here he reflected al hudr will use them
to overpower us-

  certainly was her calm response
but we must hold the room abo and
the roof which is built for defense vthe
whole hope of my plot was that al hudr
might be killed and that i might then
occupying this place bend the foolish
yezidis to my wishes now that the jaf
men and the hamavands are coming now
that tahir beg is somewhere near we must
hold the place until they arrive al hudr
will not want to harm me therefore he may
wait to starve us out we shall see
curiously enough thought fraser she
spoke as though convinced that the persian
would escape from the deathtrap yonder

dy this time the fire in the outer city
had broadened to a deep glare that
lighted the walls and the sky redly with-
in the gardens was a closer and more awful
conflagration the wooden palace alight
as though fired in a dozen places was
book magazine

shooting upward in blazing fury amid the
crackling roar of the flames all lesser
sounds were lost only here and again came
a shot or some thin keen yell of allah
to tell of strife

  the men of sulaimanieh could not of
course hope for more than to die like
warriors sword in hand to effect more
than a mad slaughter of the infidels was
not their aim they could not escape nor
did they want to escape the wild fanatr
icism of the nvuslim the enlightened
had seized upon them and they were run-
ning amuck like rabid dogs hoping to
atone for their own past and to win para-
dise by dying greatly

  i must go out and be ready to guide
them through the pools if any escape and
reach here said sefid quietly no do
not come remain here both of you and
have your rifles ready you may serve
better by staying here to cover my re-
turn

  out across the maze of shallow pools
whose water glinted scarlet she passed her
slender white figure gleaming eerily in the
mounting light of the fire that was now
slavering its red tongue over all things and
bringing day into the black night on the
far side of the water she paused and stood
there in the open waiting none who ar-
rived from the palace could fail to see her
fraser clenched his hands at thought of
her danger as he stood there motionless
searching the empty gardens for any sign
of peril to her then he felt winkler touch
his arm and he turned

  upon my word sir shes marvelous
winkler was staring wide-eyed after the
girl just the mere beauty of her mr
robert-it shines through her like a flame
inside-and just as cool as you and i are
i dont know when ive seen so remarkable
a young woman sir-

 thank you winkler and fraser
chuckled as he clapped the other on the
back i knew youd come around to my
viewpoint when youd met her

  winkler gave him a startled look choked
back a sudden comprehending expostula-
tion and then slowly smiled

  yes sir i congratulate you very
heartily mr robert i only hope he
added slyly that your father does also

  i hope he does-for his own sake said
fraser ah theres someone coming-
see here suppose you get up to the roof of
this place take a couple of extra rifles
and be ready to use em if i shout

by h bedford-jones

  winkler vanished inside the tower

  the palace had now become a roaring
pinnacle of fire the whole building must
have caught like a vast torch for every
corner of it seemed in flames soaring in a
great burst of almost smokeless scarlet
light transforming the whole sky into
crimson bright as day were the gardens
under this terrible light and fraser had
discerned a running figure that approached
the tower he saw sefid watching the fig-
ure also her hands upraised to shield her
face from the fierce heat of the conflagra-
tion

  then he saw her beckon to the man
turn and start toward the tower he low-
ered his rifle recognizing one of the two
hamavands

  it was kind of a hudr to provide
this neat little place for us he reflected
attackers could get through these pools
of course but they would be delayed-
and we could decimate them in the
attempt the tower itself hasnt an
opening that ive seen the door would
have to be battered away or a hole
blown through the walls-and a hudr
is not going to take any chances on
killing sefid well heres one of our
friends no more are in sight poor devils
the sulaimanians certainly served us well
tonight-shaik nuri showed them how to
die and they learned the lesson

cefid reached him and behind her
stumbled the hamavand who greeted
fraser with a hoarse cry of wild exultation
and halted

  greeting brother praise be to allah
we have struck the infidel a blow this night
however a hudr has escaped i think his
armor saved him how the man fought
idolater or not he is a lion-

  youre alone demanded fraser did
none of the others escape-

  none so far as i know returned the
hamavand coolly my comrade was
slain and the yezidis are running down the
men of sulaimanieh like wolves a laugh
broke harshly from him a hudr may
his grave be desecrated is still seeking
sefid in the bonfire yonder but he will be
searching the gardens soon enough a rifle
forme good

  the mountaineer was unhurt by a
miracle

  true enough said sefid they will
be searching the gardens let us wait a
moment or two more-if none of the su-
the brazen peacock

the blue

laimanians come we can go into the tower
and shut the door

  they waited a nervous tense time
wherein the minutes dragged into hours
the palace fire was at its height-a vast
crackling uproar of flames so close that
the heat was blistering

  then suddenly they perceived on either
hand hordes of running figures a startled
yell from winkler up above reached them
in warning yezidis these enemies all

  in cried sefid close the door-
thrust out upon the bar and it closes
itself

  fraser who had given his rifle to the
hamavand watched them enter then bent
above the iron bar that propped the door
ajar it was hot to the touch so hot that
he recoiled with a startled exclamation
but spurred by a rifle-shot and the whine
of a bullet flying from the stones of the
tower he gripped the bar of iron and
threw his weight on it for a space it
did not move the door a great slab of
iron seven feet by four hung at an angle
responded no whit to his effort

  the bar throw it outward came
the voice of sefid

  fraser gathered himself desperately
flung his weight against the iron bar with
a savage intensity this time it gave-
unexpectedly carried off his balance by
the sudden give he staggered for an in-
stant and that instant was fatal the
pivoted door swung down and in fraser
tried to spring backward and failed the
great slab of iron struck him glancingly
and hurled him stunned a dozen feet
away fraser heard the harsh reverber-
ant clang as it clashed shut-then all the
flaming sky went black for him

d arties of the yezidis came dashing

	forward having seen the figure of sefid
and knowing that here was the woman they
had been sent to find as they closed in
about the tower however they were sud-
denly halted by the shallow pools of water
among which they slipped and stumbled in
panic fearing some unknown trap

  and stumbling thus bullets began to
drive among them two rifles spoke from
the roof of the tower-two riflemen shoot-
ing as fast as they could use the loaded
weapons that lay ready to their hands
with shouts of dismay the attackers broke
gave way plunged back to shelter before
their eyes that tower had suddenly closed
tightly and they suspected magic in it

  they ran to the edge of the clearing
then formed in groups suddenly amaze-
ment and fear seized upon them at sight
of a white figure which appeared on the
parapet of the tower standing erect before
them and upholding in her hands the
brazen peacock in that brilliant firelight
every detail stood out plainly words could
not be heard for the roaring of the flames
but none were needed she stood thus for
a moment then vanished

  the yezidis paused irresolute their
ranks constantly swelled by new arrivals
they dared not attack because of the
bullets which had strewn their dead among
the shallow pools of water and because
al hudr had issued stern orders that sefid
be unharmed while they stood thus hes-
itant before their eyes the great iron door
of the tower slowly swung open it was
swung outward by two men and in the
opening they saw sefid still bearing that
brazen peacock the woman no less than
the sacred image struck awe into them

  then before them all sefid suddenly
ran forth stooped above the figure of fra-
ser and pulled him back to safety the
two men with her held open the door ob-
viously with tremendous effort sefid had
rejoined them before a man of the enemy
could move and as she vanished dragging
fraser behind her the door came shut
again with a clang to those who looked
on in awe the tower  stood bare and
unapproachable al hudr had been sent
for but he came not instead came orders
from him bidding the yezidis remain where
they were and to attempt no attack

  so fearing him they remained at the
edge of the clearing about the tower and
waited the great blast of the conflagra-
tion was over the palace was reduced to
flaming pinnacles dying grandeur amid
which its ancient stone portions remained
incandescent white-hot yet there was no
lack of light an area of the outer city
was still blazing and many of the yezidis
now withdrew outside the palace grounds
from the outer city too was rising a great
clamor and a strident shouting punctuated
by rattling shots so that it seemed some
riot had burst forth more and more of
the crowd about the tower slipped away

  upon regaining the shelter of the tower
in safety-no little to their surprise-
winkler and the hamavand were ordered
to the roof by sefid

  up with you she cried impatiently
standing above the senseless figure of bob
book magazine



fraser i can attend to him-you must
be on the roof lest they try to scale the

walls

  there is sense to that growled the
hanaavand and winkler reluctantly aban-
doned fraser to the care of sefid and as-
cended with the kurd to the roof to await
developments

tthe rifles reloaded they crouched behind

	the parapet and awaited the attack-
which did not materialize not a yezidi
stirred to approach the tower not a shot
was directed toward the two defenders
tbe dark groups clustering about the edge
of the garden clearing seemed to be await-
ing some event in silence

  sheep without a leader spat the ha-
mavand expressively wait till al hudr
comes

  waiting was nervous work however and
the chieftain did not appear gradually
the two men realized that instead of the
groups about the tower being augmented
they were rapidly lessening in numbers
nor was the cause far to seek

  there is fighting in the city observed
the kurd listening and the fire-glare is
widening those sulaimanians must not
be all dead yet-hark to the shots-and
doubtless al hudr is there ask the lady
sefid to come up here brother

  winkler went to the ladder top and
called sefid obtaining no answer he de-
scended through the upper room to the
lower chamber he stood there at the foot
of the ladder staring around in petrified
astonishment bob fraser and sefid had
vanished bodily

  the great iron door was closed wink-
ler had been watching from the roof and
knew that they had not left the tower
yet-they were not here he called fran-
tically and obtained no answer the ha-
mavand above hearing his voice and con-
jecturing that something was wrong came
down the ladder-and stood staring
blankly then a sudden furious oath burst
from him

  al hudr-may he roast in hell-
slipped in here by some secret passage and
carried them both away-see here is
proof by allah

  stooping the kurd picked up a torn
white scrap-a bit of sefids dress but
winkler stared at the blank stones around
him utter despair in his eyes and in his
heart he echoed the blazing imprecations of
bis comrade

chapter xvi

    none shall live m this world longer than
   the time set by me-the black book

bob fraser wakened to a sense of
suffocation which proceeded from
cloths wound about his head he
found that he was bound hand and foot
also he presently realized that he was be-
ing carried-he could feel hands upon him
and coufd hear the grunting of those who
bofe him he lay quiet and tried to think
out what had happened

  his last memory was of the iron door
knocking him sprawling it abode with
him sharply for bis head was dizzy and
ached abominably knowing nothing of
his rescue he concluded that he had been
carried off a prisoner by the yezidis a
moment later he was confirmed in this be-
lief by hearing the voice of al hudr which
he recognized instantly

  set down the nazarene and see if he
is dead give me a cup of wine-the white
pearl has fainted drink if you will
brethren there is no further need for si-
lence how many of those fools were on
the roof of the tower i know not-let
them stay there until they starve 

  upon hearing the name of sefid fraser
started with sudden fear then he felt
himself dropped on the earth and the
cloth was jerked away from about his
head he did not open his eyes however
but lay motionless

  he is not dead lord said a kurdish
voice but he is senseless

  then disturb him not answered al
hudr with a short laugh let him sleep
until he is crucified the infidel dog two
of you go back outside and bring down
here four eunuchs from the harem building
which has escaped the fire know you
where the opening lies

  no lord answered a voice we have
never known its secret until tonight and
you summoned us in such haste that we
took small note of the way-

  very well snapped the chieftain im-
patiently go back the way we came and
the opening will bring you out to the left
of the shrine among the trees note well
the entrance and bring back the eunuchs
at once here is my ring to be your au-
thority

  fraser opened his eyes cautiously and
by degrees became aware of what place he
was in some underground chamber he had
guessed from the talk so sefid was here
the brazen peacock

what had happened at the tower he could
only conjecture

  he found himself lying on the ground
fast bound above and behind him out
of his range of vision men were drinking
and discussing the events of the night he
guessed from the voices that there were
but two remaining and they were of a
hudrs mercenaries a lamp was hanging
overhead wine jars stood along the walls
evidently then this was the wine-cellar
of the palace or some chamber along a
secret passage that had been stored for a
hudrs use

twenty feet distant fraser beheld the
figure of sefid lying on a divan while
above her stooped a hudr a wine-cup in
his hand the chieftain was attempting
to revive the girl and an instant later the
attempt was more successful than he had
thought evidently

  without warning sefids hand flashed a
knife from her bosom and struck an ex-
clamation broke from a hudr then he
had caught her hand and was laughing

 so white pearl he mocked her
gently this is the measure of your love
for me eh

  he twisted the knife from her hand and
tossed it into a corner sefid sat up then
rose

  love she repeated scathingly think
not that you will ever have love from me
idolater

  others have said the same but have
changed their minds and a hudr
laughed admiration gleamed in his stern
eyes as he watched her what a woman
you are white pearl did you think that
i would hold anger against you for this
nights work nay it was a shrewd blow
but no great harm is done a palace is de-
stroyed-another can be rebuilt those
traitors of sulaimanieh slew a few of my
men-and by this time they are dead save
for those who held the tower with you
and i can kill them if i so desire or starve
them

  your rescue of this nazarene was a
bold deed sefid and i love you for it aye
i was watching from the secret passage and
i saw you pull into the tower as your men
held open the door a brave deed-al-
though it might have ended otherwise had
i not ordered my men to do you no hurt
and now it is all over sefid the sulai-
manians are dead the fires are being
quenched you are in hand again and ere

the blue



dawn the nazarene shall be gasping on a
cross at the gates and with me is melek
taus-

  as he spoke a hudr gestured toward
the brazen peacock which he had brought
from the tower and had set upon a wine-jar
close at hand

  agha fraser fooled me well he con-
tinued his face darkening i thought
that he was getting the image from tahir
beg-and all the while you had it well
it was a clever game but i am the winner
of it and the nazarene shall be nailed to
beams in payment thanks be to azazil
that there was no wind this night else had
all the inner buildings gone up in flames

  would that they had retorted sefid
bitterly and you with them

  a hudr smiled then as he saw the
girls eyes leap to bob fraser he wheeled
suddenly and realized that the american
was awake the conversation had made
clear to fraser what had taken place and
he knew that there was now no mercy to
be expected

  its too bad you came through the af-
fray unhurt a hudr he said youre
more of a fool than i thought you were-a
fool for luck goes the proverb

  the chieftain snarled at him

  we shall see how bravely you are
talking after sunrise nazarene-a few
hours of hanging on the nails lays bare the
soul of a man but where are those ac-
cursed eunuchs go out into the passage
one of you and call

  one of the two kurds swaggered past
a hudr to a curtained entrance passed
into a dark passage beyond and shouted
he returned shaking his head

  i heard no answer lord-and the way
is dark

  hell swallow the fools snapped a
hudr

por a moment he stood in frowning
thought then strode to sefid in sud-
den decision and grasped her wrists she
fought against him but vainly

  come hither and tie her arms a
hudr commanded the grinning men they
obeyed and sefid stood raging but help-
less i will go ahead with her do you
carry the nazarene and follow there is
work to be done up above and i have no
time to be lingering here in talk those
black devils shall shriek under whips to-
morrow

  thus swore a hudr not knowing that
book magazine



his two messengers had been slain and
the eunuchs with them and that the sword
had entered into penjivan the uncon-
quered

  thrusting the brazen peacock beneath
his waistcloth al hudr took in one hand
the bound writs of sefid and in the other
the hanging lamp he urged the girl for-
ward and the two kurds quickly picked up
fraser and followed then one of them
grumbling got out his knife and slashed
at the bonds around frasers ankles

  are we camels to carry this infidel
growled the man let him walk-and
hold a knife to his back brother 

  to all this al hudr made no objectioi
but led the way along a narrow passage
that was plainly a relic of ancient times
for it was floored and walled with hewn
stones sefid knowing that all resistance
was futile offered none but walked along
as proudly as though she had won her bold
game instead of having lost it utterly-
and herself with it fraser his wrists
still bound was helpless in the grip of his
two guards

  the passageway seemed to wind and
twist interminably nor indeed was it any
short distance that the tunnel covered
when at last al hudr came to a halt
fraser saw that before the party was a door
of heavy beams this al hudr swung
open beyond appeared stone steps lead-
ing upward and in the light of the lamp
that the chieftain carried a trap door ap-
peared overhead

  al hudr paused and summoned one of
the kurds to lift this door the man
pushed past and applied his weight the
door swung upward and fell away

  the party left the secret passage behind
and fraser saw that they had emerged in
a comer of the gardens cloaked with trees
between the harem buildings and the shrine
of the yezidis from al hudr came a
startled word as he pressed forward

  what is this-there is fighting in the
city are those sulaimanians not yet
dead

  fighting there was indeed as the babel
of shouts and clamorings and shots bore
full witness the blazing pyre of the pal-
ace had burned itself nearly out yet there
was a broad glare of fire across the sky
and with visible haste and uneasiness al
hudr led his party from among the trees
dashing down the lamp as he went

  they emerged suddenly in a wide area
of light-they had come out upon the

by h bedford-jones

opening before the shrine and here in
blank amazement all paused

  the inner city seemed filled with con-
fusion on alf sides rifles were spitting
men were running and fighting and slaying
and above the uproar rang out wild yells
of allahu al hudr and his two men
were stricken aghast by the spectacle for
the night was turned into day by the glare
from the burning city fraser however
awoke to mad realization of what it all
meant

  take this dog to the gates and crucify
him snapped al hudr this-

  tahir beg the shout broke from
fraser and lifted through the din tahir
beg to the rescue hamavands tahir
beg

ursing one of the guards smote fra-
ser across the mouth he reeled laugh-
ing under the blow-laughing in wild ex-
ultation al hudr loosed his hold on sefid
and sprang away-too late did he realize
the truth too late did he comprehend the
dread fate that had come upon him and his
city

  before al hudr could take two steps a
wild mob of men was surging down upon
the party the two mercenaries clutched
at the rifles slung over their shoulders-
they were caught in the swirling mob and
went down to death all about him fraser
saw the fierce faces of jafs and hamav-
ands fighting to reach sefid he glimpsed
al hudr scimetar in hand clearing a little
space around him the chieftain had be-
come a madman frothing at the lips in-
sensate under this blow of fate that had
stricken him so terribly

  and then suddenly a roar sounded
above the shouts and clamor and the crowd
fell back from al hudr through their
ranks leaped tahir beg revolver in hand
with but a glance toward sefid and fraser
who now stood together the great kurd
planted himself before al hudr

  ho idolater he bellowed furiously
ho ravisher of maidens mocker of hos-
pitality pray now to your false god

  al hudr who was unarmed except for
that terrible sword of his cast one quick
glance around and saw that there was no
escape he drew himself erect with a
proud gesture

  shoot then he said simply

  tahir beg hurled the revolver away
with a great laugh of delight

  by the right of the lord of the faith-
the brazen peacock

ful i am no butcher he swore give
me a blade like his some of you-hasten
did i not say that some day i would meas-
ure weapons with you persian well i
am here

  already fraser and sefid had been
freed of their bonds by the hamavands
who pressed about them tahir beg
bareheaded took the curved blade that one
of his men passed into his hand and shook
it at a hudr joyfully the persian had
lost his green mantle and his helmet with
it he was clad only in his chain-mail that
enveloped his body to the knees

  room shouted tahir beg room
in the name of allah now persian let
us see whether god or shaitan be
stronger-

  azazil yelled a hudr and leaped to
the attack

  the watching circle of men fell silent
with every moment others were joining the
crowd and these also became silent as
they watched the two figures in the center
fraser with sefids hands in his felt her
fingers clench convulsively

a l hudr was upon the great kurd like
a falcon-striking evading darting in
and out with the swiftness of light no less
agile was tahir beg and no less master
of his weapon they had come up these
twain from the old days when swords
ruled the hills and rifles were rare in the
land and with them they had brought a
skill with the blade that few men could
match today

  before them between them over them
the scimetars whirled like scarlet brands in
the light of the conflagration steel struck
on steel sparks glimmered from the meet-
ing of the blades blow followed blow with
the rapidity of light yet the two were un-
touched each of them a fighting man by
birth by divine grace they fought not
alone with muscles and brute strength but
with the sixth sense that only such men
possess

  upon the swelling crowd abode a death-
like silence above them unheeded
floated the canopy of flames from the outer
city the clamor and shots and uproar
here was only a dread stillness through
which sounded the hoarse breathing of the
fighters the stamping of their feet on the
stone flags the clash and ring of the
scimetars with tahir beg was the fierce
craving for vengeance with a hudr the
utter ferocity of the trapped animal death

the blue



hovered above them visibly in the reeking
skies no voice was raised to urge tahir
beg onward and none was needed yet in
the silence a hudr could not but feel the
enmity that ringed him in the deep hatred
gleaming from every eye he was cooler
now his frothing rage mastered and he
fought venomously

  like lightning were his blows but tahir
beg laughed as his blade circled and par-
ried them and swung hissing back at a
hudr then suddenly the kurd stag-
gered and reeled backward from all
the crowd broke a low gasping breath and
a hudr sprang forward to cut terribly-
but the cut was parried tahir beg lifted
his left hand and wiped a red smear from
his eyes as it trickled downward

  allahu he croaked and plunged at
the chieftain

  now a new figure pushed forward amid
the crowd-a tall broad-shouldered figure
bob fraser did not see it for his gaze was
riveted to the fighters but a hudr saw it
saw the grim implacable countenance of
howard z frazer there looking on silently
and his teeth bared in a dreadful snarl

  you next-after-this jackal he cried
hoarsely few knew to whom he referred
for iio eye was lifted from the battle to seek
new arrivals but tahir beg guessed aright
and laughed hoarsely

  the jackal bites he uttered and his
blade rang against the chain-mail of a
hudr-reached it for the first time al-
though it slid harmlessly from the mail
he struck again with terrible strength a
hudr countered the blow but with a clash
and clang his jeweled scimetar flew shat-
tered into gleaming shreds of steel

  tahir beg checked himself drew back
swiftly

  give the dog another weapon

  a hudr standing empty-handed spat a
curse and seized the nearest weapon of
those extended to him again he rushed
at the kurd again the blades curved and
glimmered and bit in the red glare

  from the crowd leaped forth a gasping
cry-blood sprang suddenly to the chain-
mail of a hudr a thin trickle of red
where tahir begs point had ripped but
it was no mortal hurt and the sting of it
redoubled the furious energy of the chief-
tain

they were wearying now wearying fast
both of them sweat dripped from
their faces and again tahir beg wiped the
book magazine



crimson smear from his brow their breath
came from clenched teeth sharp and hoarse
and panting no longer could the crowd
bear that frightful tensity in silence cries
began to rise from all sides in wild inco-
herence allah upon him  may shai-
tan seize his feet strike in the name of
god weaken infidel weaken

  the blows became more furious as both
men felt the strain al hudrs point ripped
at the shoulder of tahir but at this the
great kurd plunged forward madly fe-
rociously his scimetar whined down and
again down in a tempest of clashing
strokes nor could al hudr altogether meet
that storm with his whirling steel he be-
gan to give ground he began to dodge he
began to shrink from the onslaught the
end was not far

  al hudr slipped he fell forward and
came to his knees and knowing that he
could not rise in time he remained thus
his hands flung out before him the breath
bursting from his lungs in great gasps it
seemed that in his raging shame of defeat
he could not face his enemies again but
tahir beg withholding his arm spat at
him in scorn

  up idolater up and pray to your
false god

  finding that there was no stroke to
bring death so easily al hudr rose now
upon him burst the kurd with a hurricane
of clanging strokes pressing him backward
driving him among the circle of men who
gave ground in wild confusion to this
side and that roved the desperate hollow
eyes of al hudr and found no escape he
struck at his enemy again desperately
gathered all his strength and struck in a
terrible effort to break through the gleam-
ing circle of steel and find the life of the
kurd

  his blows failed-and as they failed as
the arm of al hudr drooped in an instant
of desperate weariness tahir beg flashed
down his scimetar al hudr tried to meet
that lightning sweep but his blade was
dashed away the steel drove at his neck
above the edge of the chain-mail drove
down and bit deep into his breast he
threw out his arms and reeled backward

  allah gasped tahir beg he stood
as though dazed his eyes fiercely alight
his nostrils quivering with great breaths
then as the crowd began to surge forward
he lifted his weapon above the dead body
of al hudr and wiped the blood from it
with his sleeve

by h bedford-jones

  the fate of every man is written in his
forehead he exclaimed praise be to
allah

  bob fraser drew a deep breath-and
turned to meet the eyes of his father

chapter xvii
finis coronat opus

the downtown offices which housed
the many and varied financial activ-
ities of howard z fraser looked
forward to his return with a unanimous
lack of joy the morning newspapers had
carried a brief account of the arrival of his
yacht in quarantine and the officers knew
that he could be expected to descend upon
them at any minute

  nor could the underlings who acknowl-
edged his sway of iron be greatly blamed
for this joyless prospect during the past
three years their master had become known
among them as the boss grouch and
their freedom from his attention in the
past few months had been as a glorious
vacation to all who served him

  gee aint it fierce mourned the of-
fice boy hell stomp in an growl some-
thin under his breath and stomp on into
his own office-an therell be hell to pay
all down the line itll be just like he
hadnt been away moren a day

  thus when a stenographer from one of
the front offices spread the information that
his well-known limousine was drawing up
in the street outside something like a
groan ascended from everyone the noon
hour had just concluded

  when howard z fraser crossed the
threshold of his offices and paused there
however his appearance was hailed with a
general gasp of amazement every eye was
fastened upon him in unconcealed wonder
here was not the man they had known-
here was a new man here was a man
ten years younger whose eye sparkled with
vitality and the joy of life-a man come
home again as though he had found the
fountain of youth

  hello everybody shouted howard z
fraser with a joyous lack of dignity
hows everything wheres smithers
smithers the general manager came
rushing forward through astounded ranks
the boss grouch seized his hand and
shook it vigorously beamingly

well well if it isnt great to be back
fraser shook hands delightedly with
the brazen peacock	by h bedford-jones



everyone and when smithers nervously
mentioned certain affairs of business
fraser positively brushed him aside

  business nothing doing today smith-
ers-nothing today i have more import-
ant affairs on hand i came down to get
that jewel case out of my safe get it for
me will you old man

cmithers staggered off to get the jewel
 case that had reposed for years in the
private safe in the inner office fraser
continued his hand-shaking beaming with
delight and showering cordiality on every
hand

  the fraser mansion meantime was
being hurriedly turned inside out by a
frantic corps of servants under directions
from winkler who was the only cool and
self-possessed person on the premises at
three-thirty a car delivered a somewhat
flustered clerical gentleman who was
promptly ushered into the private library
of howard z fraser after ushering in the
clergyman winkler closed the door and
stood at attention

  here doctor-you remember bob
exclaimed fraser sefid allow me to pre-
sent the reverend doctor jones-we de-
cided at the last minute doctor to have a
private ceremony here in this room for per-
sonal reasons hope we havent rushed
you-and this is my old friend gholam
ali tahir beg aorami-he isnt achristian
doctor although miss de montfort has de-
cided to embrace that faith-

  god bless my soul murmured the
dazed cleric staring from the blushing
happy face of sefid to the laughing bob
fraser andfrom the exuberant howard
z fraser to the hugely mustached features
of tahir beg the great kurd was clad
in frock-coat and all the accompaniment
thereof the garments were not comfort-
able to him -but being a gentleman he
wore them with a grand air

  well have it all over by four has-
tened on howard z fraser and then well
hold the reception and- winkler you
and tahir beg are to be the witnesses so
stand out all ready doctor

  the reverend gentleman found his
prayer-book thrust into his hand by bob
fraser and then stood motionless for a mo-
ment at length he directed his gaze
downward with a perceptible sniffing be-
neath his feet was the ancient and incred-
ible dirty kurdish rug

the

   dont mind it and howard z fraser
 clapped him on the shoulder its a good
 smell when you get used to it doctor-
 why tahir beg will sit there all day long
 and dream that hes back in kurdistan

yyith a helpless look around doctor
jones probably feeling that this gen-
eral levity was most indecorous and out of
place opened his book and proceeded to
earn the fat fee that was in readiness for
him he was to receive another shock
when tahir beg affixed his signature as
witness in flowing persian characters

   at four oclock most of the guests had
 assembled and with them newspaper men
 from every sheet in the city-admitted by
 express invitation of the host flowers
 decked the great rooms buffets groaned
 beneath the weight of caterers delicacies
 and more than one jaded business man
 brightened visibly when ice-frosted buckets
 of silver became visible and it proved evi-
 dent that prohibition had not affected the
 fraser cellars

   the door of the private library opened
 and howard z frazer promptly introduced
 his son and daughter to his assembled
 guests en masse then leaving bob to do
 the explaining he rushed away on an im-
 portant errand

   the nature of this errand was made
clear when winkler opened the dining room
doors and exposed to view the table bearing
a huge bride-cake beside it stood howard
z fraser who lifted his hand for attention
and then indicated the cake

   here my friends he exclaimed is a
 slight surprise for the bride and groom-
 this object which you see adorning the
 cake is a historic symbol which is sup-
 posed to represent a peacock it has been
 vitally connected with certain experiences
 we have had in kurdistan and it has
 brought the best luck in the world to me
 and to my son sefid my dear come
 here and cut the cake-and make the
 brazen peacock bring you the best of luck
 in years to come

   howard z fraser admitted afterward
that he had intended to tell exactly what
the brazen peacock was-but upon meet-
ing the eye of the reverend doctor jones
his nerve had failed him however the
clerical gentleman read all about the image
of melek taus in the next mornings
papers and if he was shocked he said
nothing of it

eddy martin manager of the
howard mercantile company
faced his superintendent across the
managerial desk for the third time
in a week and for the third time there
was a complaint on his lips

  look here sanderson martins usual-
ly cheery countenance was set and stern
i hate to be continually finding fault
but frankly youre not making good

  the superintendent smiled slightly
youve narrowed it down to me
why not i cant go to each man indi-
vidually youre the one in direct contact
-and somethings radically wrong
decidedly so but-

  you know yourself that were employ-
ing more men right now than we ever have
had on the pay-roll before and what are
we getting out of it slipshod work mis-
takes which nobody seems to care about
lack of loyalty and everything else that
goes to wreck the morale of an institution
and as far as i can see the whole thing
is flatly up to you

  again the superintendent smiled youre
absolutely sure of that

  as sure as i can be of anything youre
over the foremen and the foremen are
over the men you know their troubles
if they have any and youre supposed to
be able to find a remedy for them or to
explain them in such a way that i or some
one higher up can find a remedy but
youve done nothing



  perhaps theres nothing to do

  eddy martins first hit the desk
nothing to do you admit dont you
that things are in bad shape here
exactly

  you admit that its your duty to find
out what the trouble is so that it can be
rectified

  certainly

  then why one earth man dont you
do it

  a moment of silence then perhaps
i have

 then why-

a sudden change that had come over
the actions of the superintendent
caused martin to halt and to wait sander-
son had swung about in his chair and was
leaning over the desk

  i suppose he said quietly that my
job depends on my telling the cause of the
trouble here

  you naturally couldnt expect much
else could you sanderson

 frankly i couldnt but-and he
smiled again-im between the devil and
the deep sea from what ive heard if i
do tell the qiuse ill be out of a job any-
way so its six of one and a half a dozen
of the other do you really want to know
why the men arent working here do
you want to know why theyre malicious
and half-hearted and disloyal do you
ive asked you three times in a week
man to man

  but suppose that information hurts
  i guess i could stand it

  sanderson stared hard into the reflec-
tions of the glass-topped desk then he
looked up sharply

  well mr martin seeing that im slated
to go either way i might as well tell you
straight the trouble isnt with the men
it isnt with the foreman and it isnt with
the superintendent its with somebody
higher up

  who

  yourself 

  i martin laughed in an uncertain
manner i whats the idea

  sanderson talking now with the assur-
ance of one who knows his fate and who
no longer must conceal his feelings to
protect himself hunched forward in his
chair and pointed a finger at the manager

  youre the one and no one else mr
martin the foreman cant do anything
with the men when those men havent
faith in the management and the foremen
havent faith either whats more neither
have i

  but-but-what have i done martin
driven to cover by the sudden accusation
was stammering sanderson shook his
head

  we dont like you thats all weve
heard just one story about you thats
enough you were in the army werent
you

  yes

  you were a top kicker

  yes first sergeant

  and now that youre back in civvies
again youre adjutant of the kenneth
carson post of the american legion arent
you

  yes martin now was on the de-
fensive without knowing why  sanderson
went on

  how many ex-service men are there in
your employ

  here as many as i can get ive
made it a rule to hire ex-service men when-
ever i could get them

true and how many of these men
are members of your post of the legion
why-i dont know ive never given
that much thought ive simply taken it
for granted-

  as youve taken everything else for
granted as youve taken it for granted
that you were liked here and that it was
not your fault that things were slipping

the blue



as youve taken it for granted that i should
be fired for something that wasnt my fault
now mr martin i want you to examine
the membership-books of your post tonight
and ive got a good deal of money that
says you wont find the name of a howard
company employee on it-besides your
own

 but-

  and whats more if anybody around
this place had enough faith in you to tell
the truth youd find that a lot of men are
staying out of the legion just because
youre in it and if there isnt any other
way to find out you might go around
sometime and ask bill harris why he
doesnt join the legion hes got the grit
to tell you

  bill harris martin stared why
hes the first man i gave a job to i made
an opening for him i-

  so sanderson arched his eyebrows
martin leaned forward

  you dont mean to tell me that hes
against me too

  the only answer was a shrug of the
shoulders

  martin stared harder than ever why
sanderson he and i were kids together
so ive heard

  we fished out of the same stream to-
gether we dug our caves and went red-haw
hunting together why-

  ive heard that too

  why we were even in the same com-
pany in france

  he told me

  and you mean to say that hes not my
friend somethings wrong with you
sanderson

the superintendent rose ive been
expecting that mr martin thats
what i thought youd say when i started
out to tell you all this i suppose my de-
parture from this company begins from
this minute if youll have my time made
out-

  your time martin smiled again
dont be so hasty sit down

  the superintendent obeyed martin
leaned forward

  i dont know what the secret of this
thing is but im going to find out youre
not fired-unless youve lied to me and
in that case i believe you will agree with
me that i would be doing right
exactly
book magazine

  very well go back to your work
im going to make investigations and
just remember this that you are not the
man on trial i am the person whos on
the griddle and im going to find out
whats wrong and i hope i will be the
sort of judge and jury that will be prej-
udiced against my case from the begin-
ning so that if there is the slightest thing
thats bad it will be wiped out and if
there is ill be the first man to confess
it so take up your job again if youre
wrong youre fired if youre right your
pays raised and if you can give me
anything that will act as a clue ill ap-
preciate it

  it was sandersons turn to stare

  thats fair mr martin he said at
last i-i didnt expect it if id known
you were-

  can you give me a clue

  sanderson raised his hands and stared
at them it isnt for me to say mr
martin id only be repeating something
thats been told me i admit that it turned
me against you just as it turned every
other man in the place against you but
it isnt my place to tell it-that belongs to
harris

  harris martins eyes narrowed
then he whistled softly i wonder-
came at last then all right sander-
son ive told you what ill do and you
know what to expect and until i find
out differently im going to believe you
the superintendent rose and went back
to his work for a while martin fingered
the various papers on his desk somewhat
vaguely then he too rose and went out
into the plant

li ere and there he walked into the
 packing-rooms the shipping-rooms
out on the docks where the gangs of men
were unloading the carload shipments of
goods which kept the great mercantile es-
tablishment alive into the order-depart-
ments and through the office many times
before he had made these trips but never
with the attitude that he now held then
he had merely walked through with a
cursory interest in the work that was be-
ing carried on now he sought to gain
from the glances of the men from their
actions the truth or untruth of sander-
sons statement-and aided by imagina-
tion it was not difficult

  there was something in the manner of
the men as they spoke to him that did

by frederick tierney



not breed trust once or twice as he
walked on he believed he heard soft-
spoken remarks passing from one to the
other suddenly he veered and made his
way toward the small white-painted in-
closure which served as an office for the
receiving clerk harris was within check-
ing his receipts he did not look up when
martin opened the door

  hows everything the manager be-
gan getting along all right

  so-so mr martin the answer was
cursory eddy thought certainly in the
old days harris had never put an appela-
tion before his name

  shipments coming in o k

  very well

  havent gotten a chance to talk to
you much since you got home bill mar-
tin went on forcing the conversation
ive meant to drop around some night
and see you where are you living now
brownleigh court

  you wouldnt object

  me oh no it would be a delight
there was sarcasm in the tone-sarcasm
which martin could not help but perceive
he went on back to the office upstairs
and to his work while harris the re-
ceiving clerk still labored over his receipts

  uncertainty was in the heart of eddy
martin the uncertainty bred by an accu-
sation which was neither proven nor re-
futed all afternoon he sought to find a
reason for it all-only to stop again and
again to whistle softly and to stare into
the far-away as with some thought he did
not care to face closing time came then
evening-and it found him in the office of
the kenneth carson post of the american
legion

  the membership books were before him
carefully he studied every name slowly
he ran through the columns of members
sanderson had been right in all the list
of the largest legion post in the city there
was not a single name which denoted an
employee of the howard mercantile com-
pany not a single man of the great num-
ber to whom he had given jobs and in
whom he had thought he possessed friends
ship

  the information was biting-it hurt
for just a moment eddy martin late of
the a e f sat there grim and
thoughtful then he closed the books with
a snap restored them to the little safe
and hurried downstairs a taxicab was
drawing to the curb he hailed it
man to man

  brownleigh court he ordered and
ten minutes later he knocked on the door
of the small apartment which bore the
name of bill harris his boyhood comrade

a smile that was almost a sneer
greeted him martin pretended not to
see a moment of random conversation
then harris far the bigger man of the
two seemed to square himself

  well he asked why this unex-
pected pleasure

  martins eyes searched his the an-
swer that came to his lips was stifled while
in its place came

  bill you happen to know i suppose
that im the adjutant of kenneth carson
post of the legion

  yes

  you and i were together in the a e f
  i remember very well

  and i was wondering bill why you
couldnt come into the legion with me
id like to have you there

  no thanks there was a snarl in
the voice

  but youre an ex-service man

  to my sorrow

  youve got a clear record bill

  it wasnt anybodys fault but my own
then it was that martin veered from
his superficial conversation things were
beginning to focus there was a look in
bill harris eyes that was menacing almost
threatening martin stepped forward-
until they were face to face-and his voice
hardened

  look here bill he said quietly you
and i were kids together we had our
scraps and we got over them i thought
we were lifelong friends ive been busy
since we got back-i havent had much
time to talk to you i thought that the
same cause kept you from coming around
to see me i found out today that there
was a different reason now youve got
a good deal more heft to you than i have
-but that doesnt worry me you can
hit an awful wallop-but ive got a bit
of one myself and ive never been afraid
of you a single day of my life-in spite of
the fact that youve licked me every time
weve fought and-

  the next time i lick you youll re-
member it had come surlily

  martin smiled coldly perhaps but
if youre not a coward and a sneak and
a dirty low-down cur youll tell me first
what its all about

the blue



  taking advantage of your ize arent
you

  im not taking advantage of anything
you can roll up your sleeves and wade
in any time you want to i asked you just
now why you wouldnt join the legion
you sneered against it and you were sar-
castic about our service in the a e f

dut a glowering face and flaming eyes
 shut him off the mouth of bill har-
ris worked a moment in silent rage then
streaming torrential the words came
dont you talk to anybody about be-
ing a low-down cur dont you even hint
at the word you-you snake you did
your best to kill me and you know you
did and now that its all over and i
came out of it alive you sneak around here
and call me a coward because i hate the
legion and the army and everything thats
connected with it

  why the query had come coolly
harris glared at him

 why you know stenay

there was a moment of silence then
i thought that was it bill ive heard
down at the plant that ugly stories have
been told about me so that was it-
and youve told that story

 why shouldnt i huh harris
leaned threateningly toward him why
shouldnt i tell that story you were my
pal my kidhood chum as you so delight
in speaking of our-our friendship yes
you were but you remember what hap-
pened at stenay dont you

  very clearly martins voice had be-
come icy now and just so that you will
know whether i have it straight or not
ill repeat it it was the next to last day
of fighting the rumors of the armistice
were going round and you couldnt wait
you went a w o l when you knew an
attack was coming off you showed up
late there wasnt anything i could do
but follow orders

  tell what you did the other man
commanded hoarsely are you ashamed
of it you took your old boyhood friend
your chum your pal and you stripped
him of his gun and his ammunition and
his bayonet and sent him out into the
lines without a single weapon thats
what you did the voice was high-
pitched raging you sent that old kid-
hood friend out into the darkness of a
night attack across the meuse without a
single thing to fight with
book magazine

  those were my orders bill

  you knew it was vin rouge that kept
me out not a yellow streak

  and you ought to know came the icy
answer that no matter what the cause
might have been what you did was a tech-
nical desertion under fire

  i didnt desert at vaux or soissons
or st mihiel i went through the ar-
gonne all right didnt i

  i told you that it was a technical de-
sertion and for a technical desertion
you could have been stood up against the
wall and shot but-

  but kind-hearted old pal of mine that
you were you contented yourself with
taking my equipment away from me and
sending me up into the line in the dark-
ness without anything you sent me up
there where i didnt have a chance in the
world to come out whole-and i wouldnt
have either if some one hadnt shoved an
automatic into my hand along there some-
where it wasnt a minute afterward that
a boche jumped me and i got him- he
pulled open his shirt and showed a ragged
red scar thats where his bayonet
caught me as he fell and yu dear old
pal that you were-you sent me into that 
i admit it bill but i didnt make
the orders

  you carried them out

  thats a soldiers duty

  you stripped me of everything i pos-
sessed and sent me out into the darkness
to fight with nothing you cant get away
from that

  and you cant get away from the fact
that if i hadnt done it some other ser-
geant would have you cant get away
from the fact that you were a w  l
in a time of danger to the regiment
what of it nearly everybody went
a w o l at one time or another
true-but not during or just before a
battle it became something else then
bill it was desertion and my orders-
the other man snarled and gestured
heatedly

  orders hell he snapped whoever
issued orders like that produce them
thats all i want you to do youve been
talking about orders-now i want you to
show em to me you cant do it-and
neither can any other man that ever served
in the a e f because there werent
any such orders 

  eddy martin smiled thinly

  i thought vou had more sense than

by frederick tierney



that bill ill admit that you cant find
them instead youll find the same old
thing about desertion under fire being pun-
ishable by death but if youre the keen
person ive always thought you to be youll
know that the commander of a division did
a good many things that were dictated by
circumstances and not by cut and dried
orders the old man made up his mind
that there should be no desertions from
our division technical or otherwise the
man who went a w o l when he abso-
lutely knew that an attack was coming off
was a technical deserter it was over-
looked for a while and the usual excuses
taken but there came the time when it
couldnt be overlooked any longer and
that was when you were unlucky enough
to get caught in the net you cant get
away from the fact bill that the old
mans system at least gave a man a chance
whether it was in conformance with gen-
eral orders from g h q or not and you
cant escape the fact that men did
desert and that it was an impossibility
to tell the difference between those and
the men who were a w o l can you
bill lord man that way out was
invented to save just such fools as you and
give you a fighting chance to redeem your-
self without a blot on your record
thats enough it wasnt the unwritten
order that saved me it was the buddy
who slipped me a gun in the dark im
through with your preaching ive been
through with you since that night and ill
tell you here and now that ill injure you
at every chance i get ill work against
you and slave against you and fight against
you with every atom of strength and hate
and malice that ive got in my body
ill-

  against me but not against the how-
ard mercantile company

a roar of rage a coat was stripped
from the heavy shoulders of bill har-
ris his great muscles flexed his hands
clenched

  all right well have it that way
against you-and you alone ill leave
the plant tomorrow-but when i go
theyll know why theyll take one look
at you and see the reason get off that
coat there-hear me get off that coat
these rooms dont let out much sound-
we can go to it as far as we please and
were going the whole road

  he moved his arms viciouslv as thouerh
man to man

the blue

to loosen the great muscles i couldnt
do this in the army-theyd have had me
in the guardhouse for it but now were
man to man-and there arent any regu-
lations to protect you there-

  then he stopped before him eddy
martin smaller far less muscular was
waiting his coat and collar stripped-
waiting again to be beaten as he had been
beaten in their every fight since childhood

  a moment of circling defense each
seeking for the advantage of a momently
lull in the guard a few sparring blows
which touched lightly then a rush by
the bigger man which forced eddy mar-
tin far into a corner of the room and from
which he escaped only after a bruising
blow had crashed against a cheek it
dazed him slightly but he forced a
smile and dodged a blow aimed for his
jaw the other man came grimly on
mumbling as he watched his chance

  you took away my gun he snarled
you sent me out to get killed but it
didnt work thingsll square up a bit
after this-you havent got any shavetail
and any captain and any major behind
you now youve-

  then he stopped eddy martin had
gone under his guard to send a crackling
blow against his jaw it brought a rush
from the other man and a tangle of blows
-then the crouching defense again each
man watching the other each set of arms
milling slowly each sinuous body twisting
about the room waiting warily for the
first opening the first chance-

  a crash bill harris fist had shot forth
and found flesh sending martin toppling
half across the room but the smaller
man straightened and came into the fight
again while the larger smiled grimly with
the vengeance that was his

  that was for the bandolier of cart-
ridges you took off me he said slowly
youre going to get paid back for every-
thing

  again a rush but this time martin
evaded him a second later the smaller
man gliding under his guard pelted blow
after blow upon the larger mans body
seeking in vain for some vulnerable spot
panting he dropped back into his de-
fense again only to find that defense sud-
denly broken and the great fists of bill
harris crashing in upon him forcing him
to retreat and to cover

  and thats for the rifle and for the
bayonet the bigger mans voice was

louder now straighten up there and
fight-hear me-im not going to pound
you to pieces without-

  im fighting came the answer im
fighting

and martin proved it with every bit
 of his strength he leaped forward and
sent forth his fists in a torrent of blows
that the slower-working machine before
him could not guard against time and
again the smacking crackle of fist against
flesh sounded as the smaller man sent blow
after blow into the face and neck and body
of his antagonist crossing and recrossing
uppercutting and slashing martin was
fighting with all the reserve power he could
summon seeking by the very ferocity of
his attack to beat down the other man to
break his attack before that strength van-
ished blood came flowing from a long
cut over harris eye and from the ragged
fringes of his lips where the tight clenched
fists of eddy martin had struck them
then a quick snapping sound a wincing
expression of pain on martins face and
his attack ceased

  but harris did not see that expres-
sion harris did not notice that one hand
no longer was clenched harris did not
stop to investigate why the guarding arm
of eddy martin continually was the same
the world was red to bill harris now
red with hate and long pent-up malice red
with the surge of conflict and with the
thin trickle of blood which flowed from
his forehead out lashed his heavy fists
sending martin reeling before him-again
and again while his voice thundered

  and thats for the darkness you sent
me into thats for the guns that were
trying to kill me-thats for the man who
wouldnt protect a friend thats-

  then he stopped a careening weav-
ing figure showed before him staggering
dazedly around the room then it
dropped limp inanimate the old old
story had been told once more eddy
martin fighting as he had always fought
against the greater odds of the others
strength had been whipped again

  for just a second bill harris stood over
his victim panting wiping the blood from
his face then as the man on the floor
stirred weakly the bigger man forced for-
ward a hand

  here he ordered surlily get up
youre whipped i guess that evens things
up a little
book magazine



  slowly a hand was raised then dropped
take the other came weakly that
ones broken

  broken harris asked the question
in a new tone since when

  oh it doesnt make much difference
eddy martin had forced a grin it was
when i was trying to knock you for goal

it didnt work

  i didnt know some of the churlish-
ness was gone from harris voice you
could have yelled quits i dont have to
fight a man with a broken hand to even
up my scores i can wait

  even eddie martin was on his feet
now and staggering dizzily around the
room who said we were even

  do you want more

  no thanks the smaller man grinned
again but were not even bill whatd
you ever do with that forty-five

  that gun i saved it it was the
only thing-

then for the love of mike get it and
give it back to me youll find three lit-
tle notches in the stock if you dont be-
lieve me-the three boche i got at vaux
you-you bill harris was staring

by frederick tierney

blankly you slipped it to me out there
-you

  why not eddy was really grinning
now there wasnt any regulation against
that was there

the eyes of bill harris blinked in a
dazed almost non-understanding man-
ner for a long time he stalked silently
about the room stopping now and then to
stare in bewildered fashion at the floor
then with a quick motion he reached into
a pocket and brought forth a knife a
moment more and he had dragged an army
revolver from a drawer and was busily
nicking at the stock then he straight-
ened and turned toward the old friend of
his boyhood a new look in his eyes a new
smile on his lips

  ive-ive put a couple more notches
in it eddy he said huskily one for the
boche i got and-and the other for a sore-
head who-whos gone for good

  then again a long silence followed by
the laughter of two happy men-and a
voice in sudden pain

  ouch gosh bill i forgot shake
the other one this ones broken

the profiteer plunderers

             the sporting finish

      by w douglas newton

the three plunderers of profiteers
had many quiet months before
cyprian xystus was devoured
with desire for the gillard rubies

  for several reasons they had neither
robbed nor talked of robbing the men
made rich at other peoples cost the first
was that their successful business of plun-
dering had given each enough money to
assure them a good income in the future
at the same time boyd muir the musician
was now at the top of the tree in his pro-
fession and well beyond the need of steal-
ing to maintain himself as well as far too
busy in his honest trade to afford much
time for his criminal profession but lastly

and perhaps really it was firstly with
boyd he had a growing fear and distaste
for the danger theda xystus was running
in their dark calling she had ceased to
be one who could take part in a rather
exciting and profitable adventure and had
become for boyd some one who needed
protecting from the horrors of imprison-
ment the fact that the dapper detective
max conrad had shown that the author-
ities had suspicion of the doings of the trio
filled the musician with a thrill of alarm
certainly they seemed to have thrown max
off the scent but the mere fact that he had
been on it was enough to make boyd
tremble
the profiteer plunderers

  he had been hoping that cyprian and
thecla were sharing his attitude since they
made no attempt to plan a robbery when
cyprian mentioned the gillard rubies

  they are the finest in the world my
child said the gay young dandy of a
burglar they are gems of the purest
water and that confirmed dyspeptic gill-
ard is master of them it is a crime he
hasnt a wife or a child nor kith nor kin-
nobody to wear those lovely things yet
he has them they are locked away in his
stuffy old country house in an iron-grated
showcase and nobody sees them they
bring pleasure to none

  well what about them asked boyd
turning uneasily from his piano

  i think it is our duty to release them
from that old skinflint and place them in
the care of people more worthy i dont
know of anybody more worthy than our-
selves do you

  i thought wed let looting people
slide said boyd ruefully

  yes havent we my infant said
cyprian with exasperating coolness well
be getting sadly out of practice if we go
on like this

  is it worth it asked boyd looking at
thecla

  in money those rubies are worth
every penny of nineteen thousand pounds
answered cyprian

  havent we enough money to carry
on asked boyd

  money-oh yes but i was only giv-
ing you their estimated value i wasnt
thinking of them in money terms i want
them for themselves alone i want to make
a present of them thecla would look
ripping in rubies

  why thecla said the astonished
boyd

  oh i thought perhaps youd know
why chuckled theclas irresponsible
brother i had an idea that probably
there could arise an occasion for giving
thecla a present soon

  boyd colored at the palpable hit for
certainly he and thecla were beginning to
understand each other very well thecla
herself showed a lovely confusion and said
to cyprian dont be silly and
wouldnt your present be a useful one
the first policeman who saw me in those
rubies would recognize them i should be
in custody in half an hour

  not so fast my child cried cyprian
you forget that rubies are very like each

the blue



other the setting of the gillard rubies
is unique but i fear we would have to
dispense with that setting recut even
only a little by our chinese servant and
put into a new setting i defy anybody to
name them as the gillard gems they will
be the xystus rubies--unless of course
thecla changes her name from xystus to
-well some other

  they looked at the chuckling young man
for a moment boyd gaining heart from
theclas suggestion that any policeman
might recognize the rubies felt that she
too was no longer inclined toward the dar-
ing and dangerous life they had been lead-
ing

  my dear cyprian he cried is this
worth the risk he expected a laughing
snub from the young daredevil and was
surprised to hear him say well perhaps
it isnt but hang it my child i hate to
finish off our career as plunderers in tame
comfort it demands one last and dramatic
fling and i think the rubies will give us
that to take just one last thing as 
present to thecla-that will be fitting
and that will end our escapades

  i suppose so said cyprian with a note
of regret in his voice when comfort and
a good income fly in at the window the
love of risk and adventure goes out by
the door my children

ljow are we going to set about getting

  	 these jewels asked thecla

  very simply and easily answered cyp-
rian gillard lives in an old worm-eaten
half-tumbled-down house called less-
daunt it stands in a lonely place in the
country and most of its windows wouldnt
defy an amateur moreover gillard lives
more or less alone his rooms are in the
main buildings those of his servants are
in a remote wing built apart from the main
structure in such a way as to cut him off
completely from their aid next wednes-
day too most of his servants will be away
for the night at a fair ten miles distant
the rubies are kept in a case a glass case
covered with strong wire netting in a big
old hall that henry vm was supposed to
have dined in on the ground floor there
are windows with steel shutters to this hall
but we can get in quite comfortably
through a smoking-room window rich
people are like that they turn one room
into a sort of vault or dungeon and yet
fail to stop up other avenues to the place
the job should not be difficult to us
book magazine

  youve got all your facts down pat
how did you find them out

  i went down for three days a week ago
to spy out the land i tipped the butler
and was shown the famous collection of
rubies and the rest-the public is allowed
to see em for the other facts i have to
thank a sporting fisherman who had a
grudge against old gillard because he was
a bear about a stream that ran through his
grounds

  where did you meet the talkative
sportsman asked thecla with boyd
thought a touch of suspicion

  oh in the local inn we were both
staying there and exchanged views on trout-
flies and such things in the coffee room
after dinner it was a bit of luck meeting
this fellow he came down by the same
train i saw him on the platform just be-
fore we left town he saw me too and that
gave us a sort of bond of sympathy he
was an asset he always fishes in the
district and knows all the local news
what sort of man was he demanded
thecla

  not like anyone we know my child
laughed her brother so you need not get
nervous a big burly chap red-faced and
whiskered and with about ten thoughts
only outside the topic of the rod and line
that seemed to satisfy thecla and there
was a pause broken at length by boyd
how do we set about this job
again quite simply we motor down
suitably disguised leave our car in a wood
get in through the smoking-room window
go along the passage until we get to the
oak-and-iron door of the room where the
jewels are we can break through that
door-easily after that-

everything went as cyprian had
 promised they went straight ahead un-
til they came to the iron door sheathed in
oak with a special tool inserted in the
keyhole which automatically found the
register of the lock and enabled them to
click the bolt back they let themselves into
the room and closed the door softly

  directly the door was closed there was
a snap in the room and an oil lamp lit the
place with a brilliant radiance they
sprang round there stood a big burly
man red of face and whiskered it was
evident he had been standing behind the
door when they opened it he held two
pistols in his hands with which he made a
sign that there was no mistaking

by w douglas newton



  put your hands up he commanded
and remember you are covered under-
stand i know exactly how clever you three
are and im not going to risk any tricks
at the sound of his voice the three
started but cyprian more than the others
for the voice he heard was not the voice
that should have come from the whiskered
fisherman he knew and rather despised
but the voice of one he knew and feared
but he managed to control himself and say
as coolly as ever

  would you mind taking off some of
that hair on your face it is ugly any-
how and then i should like to know who
you are

  you dont need an introduction to me
cyprian xystus said the hairy sportsman

  max conrad thecla gasped cy-
prian followed with

  the dapper and jolly little detective
man you used to be more pleasant to
look at but i admit youve fooled me
pretty thoroughly

  i meant to xystus said the detective
he plucked off his whiskers and under the
red paint of his disguise showed that he
was indeed the jolly and rather boyish de-
tective max conrad i meant to fool
you and i took no chances i had to be
perfect in my disguise ive been waiting
to get you for some time i didnt mean
to slip up this time

  you couldnt have made so good a
change in the train said cyprian coolly
would you mind telling me how you
managed it as an expert in these things
myself id like to know

  certainly i didnt change in the train
said the detective and im only too
glad to tell a sportsman like yourself how
it was done i fixed my suspicions on you
three as the bright people who were looting
the profiteers and since then i havent let
you out of my sight you havent given
me much to catch hold of but you made a
slip when you came down to reconnoiter
gillards place you bought your ticket
the evening before my confidential man
was on the spot and saw you do it and
heard you inquire for trains the next day
all i had to do wasto effect my disguise
and wait about in the station i saw you
get out and i took a room at the same inn
but you seemed to know old gillards
movements pretty well

  while you were spying out old gillards
house i was gathering information from
the innkeeper villagers and such from
the profiteer plunderers

them i learnt of gillards greediness about
his fishing rights the situation of his own
and the servants bedrooms and more to
the purpose that his servants would be
away tonight because of the big fair at
hendyke ten miles away-everybody in
the village goes there that suited me
because i knew it would suit you it fixed
the date you would make an attempt on the
jewels both of us could make adequate
preparations for the event

  yours seems to have been the more
adequate i must say said cyprian

  seem is not the word they have been
i have you the detectives pride ran a
little away with him here as cyprian had
meant it to do for that was his purpose
underlying this strange dialogue ive
got you ive got the smartest gang of
thieves of the age and ive done it all
off my own bat

  single-handed jobs are rather danger-
ous smiled cyprian

  not this one i have the drop on
you chuckled max conrad and then too
late he corrected himself you are jump-
ing at conclusions if you think this is
single-handed i warn you not to bank on
that fact because-

  he stopped speaking gave a low groan
and fell to the floor

  the tiny pistol in cyprians hand had
spoken

  boyd muir knew that pistol well it was
a tiny automatic that could be concealed
quite easily in the palm of the hand cy-
prian always carried it on his adventures
he had a theory that it was the one chance
a man had when he was in the otherwise
hopeless position of having to put up his
hands a neat attachment to his finger ring
enabled him to hold the pistol in his palm
when his hands were aloft and he always
turned the back of his hands to his op-
ponent when he raised them he had
practiced shooting from this position until
he had attained a deadly accuracy and
this and the fact that the detective was
perfectly certain that he was helpless
brought about conrads downfall

  the little bullet from this pistol does
not kill unless it strikes straight into the
eye or some other vulnerable part but
the crash of the projectile against the hard
bone of conrads temple knocked him out
completely and he fell unconscious like
a limp sack he dropped with a thud on
his own lamp and for a moment the room
was plunged in blackness

the blue



  but only for a moment the three
flash-lamps in the hands of the plunderers
were switched on at once and there was
light in the room cyprian was all activity

  we must get out of this he snapped
out the sound of the pistol will awaken
the house besides hell recover con-
sciousness soon quick sling conrads
body out of the way and get the door open
-and then for the car

  they dragged the detectives body out
of the puddle of oil in which the wick
of his lamp faintly fluttered in a feeble
flame and pulled it to a far corner so
that any people coming down into the room
would not discover the man quickly then
they wrenched open the door flung through
it and slammed it behind them its auto-
matic lock crashed home they fled
through the smoking-room window and
out of the house

there was a flurried movement of peo-

	pie stirring in the house as they ran
but they got clear it was only when they
reached the car in the thin wood and began
to crank it that they looked back at the
house standing stark in the clear moon-
light

  as they looked they saw breaking away
from it several black and thick puffs of
smoke they stood and stared aghast
cyprian voiced their thoughts

  my god he said the house is on
fire conrads lamp has set it on fire
that tomb with the iron door and shutters
is burning and conrad is in that tomb 

  for a moment they stood gazing at the
burning building with mixed emotions all
of them felt the personal significance of
this happening they recognized that with
conrad dead they were safe he had as
he said played off his own bat entirely
with him out of the way there would be
no one who knew of their crimes but
with this thought was also a feeling of
horror and decency to let a good man
die pent up in that tomb was a ghastly
thing thecla burst out

  we cant we cant allow it boyd
caught her hand and pressed it cyprian
said in his own manner of course not
thecla were burglars but were not
beasts then he added stay by the
car thecla boyd get that tool-case from
under the seat good now come along
sharp

  they dashed into the open again and
made straight for the house there was
book magazine

nobody to see them gillard and the two
women servants who remained with him
that night had made their escape by the
front they afterwards learned but they
knew already that they had been awakened
and would escape the villagers had not
yet realized the house was on fire

  the plunderers had the rear of the house
to themselves as they raced toward it
they went straight to the steel windows
of the hall and in his careful yet rapid
manner cyprian examined them boyd
opened the tool-case he picked out a
crowbar which seemed to him to be the
best tool to vanquish the strong shutters
swiftly cyprian waved those aside

  the nitro-gelatine he ordered and
reached for the phial

  noisy and dangerous boyd cautioned

  it cant be helped theres no time for
caution this house is nothing more than
a tinder box-it will blaze like one

  with a strong chisel he was hacking
a slot in the window frame and in a few
seconds he had fixed the charge and
tamped it with a special rubber and iron
tamp then he and boyd ran backward
into a ditch unrolling the electric firing-
wire as they went in less than ten seconds
there was a sharp tearing explosion part
of the side of the house was torn out and
the steel shutters crumpled a great gush
of black smoke poured out of the hole
and behind the smoke they could see the
lurid blood-red flames

  both young men ran to the opening
boyd got there first pushed his head and
shoulders in and fell back choking for
once cyprian was second boyd with
smarting eyes was able to see why he
had unwrapped his big motoring scarf from
his throat and was binding it round his
mouth he touched the musician on the
shoulder and then keeping as low as he
could crept through the opening

  boyd waited in agony for what seemed
an eternity he watched the smoke and it
grew terribly dense at one moment it
gushed out in an awful billow and he saw
the reflection of a fresh upshooting of
flames behind it something had fallen in
somewhere it had engulfed-what
cyprian as well as conrad boyd knew
a terrible fear

  the fear was growing on boyd at the
wait and he was just about to unroll his
own neck-wrap when he saw a movement in
the smoke a pair of boots appeared in
the gap in the wall and with a throb of

by w douglas newton

joy he caught hold of them and began to
tug he tugged with a will and in a short
moment the unconscious body of the de-
tective was on the ground beside him as
he bent over the body he heard cyprian
shout

  take him back to the car get him
aboard you and thecla look after him

  boyd lifted the body and staggered
across the garden to the wood in which
the car was hidden conrad was not a
light man and the journey was made with
many halts and rests cyprian boyd
recognized was probably not in a condition
to lend a hand but all the same he could
trust that alert and capable young man to
take care of himself

  it was when he reached the car that he
experienced a shock thecla and he had
no sooner hoisted the detective into the
rear seat than they turned and found cyp-
rian was not with them it was an ugly
moment they had a vision of cyprian
having completed his rescue falling down
overcome by the smoke and fumes he
was lying unconscious in that furnace
even now the flames might have reached
him boyd turned and ran back toward
the house

  as he ran he tore his scarf from his
neck and wound it about his face he
was ready to plunge into the smoke when
he reached the house and he lost no time

  it was not easy to find cyprian boyd
had heard his voice close to the wall and
was certain that he must have fallen near
it but he had to crawl through the smoke
many yards before his hand touched the
prone body for some reason cyprian had
gone back into the heart of the room
here with dense volumes of smoke above
him and the fierce and snapping flames
terribly near he had fallen boyd
scorched and suffocated his mouth bitter
with the smoke his eyes streaming and
inflamed his body weak with the awful
heat had a terrible struggle to get the
unconscious man clear it was an agony
to get him along to the car and only by
the dint of homeric exertions that he suc-
ceeded even then he had to drive off
leaving thecla to deal with the two uncon-
scious men in the back of the car

the three plunderers sat in the bright

	room of their kensington house look-
ing at max conrad the detective tired but
now fully recovered he was smiling at
them a little ruefully


the profiteer plunderers

  its an odd situation he said here
we are the captor and the captives sitting
comfortably in the latters house talking
things over and deciding what we shall do
i suggest said cyprian quietly that
you just change your remark about a little
call it my infant the captors and their
captive dont forget it is our house and
that we are in the majority

  that means nothing said conrad
i am your prisoner for the moment but
only for the moment oh i know you can
keep me tied up until you make good your
escape and all that but in the end i am
the man with the pistol in my hand i
know you i know all about you i know
for whom i have to hunt ive got you
marked down wherever you are

  youre delightedly candid said cyp-
rian well be candid too doesnt it
occur to you that we might quietly and
without fuss do away with you

  it doesnt said conrad cheerfully
i have already received confirmation of
what i already knew and that is that you
are not the dirty and murdering sort i
knew all along you were sportsmen and
thats the difficulty

  why is it a difficulty asked boyd
this to all intents and purposes it
was that sporting and decent spirit in you
that put the handcuffs so to speak on
your wrists oh i know what im talking
about you see i played this case as a
lone hand and i know you knew i did
xystus got that out of me in that room i
was so certain i had you that i let you
know well then though i was the fellow
who had all the facts the only one who
could bring a case against you you were
too clean not to remove me though twice
you had an absolutely certain chance
twice said boyd

  xystus could have pinked me through
the eye or heart with that cunning little

by w douglas newton



pistol said the detective but he simply
stunned me with it instead and then i
recovered consciousness just after the room
had got well alight from that oil lamp and
i tried to get out through those infernal
steel shutters and the door before the
smoke and fumes sent me under again i
knew i was done unless-unless some
sportsman got me out and sportsmen got
me out

  almost anybody would have done the
same said cyprian

  not on your life said the detective
heartily nine out of ten would have seen
in that accident a heaven-sent chance
with me out they would have had a clean
bill they could go secure

  he paused thoughtfully for a moment
and then stood up

  i guess he said cheerfully thats the
answer to the difficulty that fire squares
us we must take it as the others would
take it it has wiped out all evidence of
your crime we are as we were before it
well cry quits and begin again he
turned to the three with a grim twinge
under his smile but understand we
begin again next time ill get you sure
and therell be no mercy about it

  there isnt going to be a next time
said boyd weve finished

  all the better said conrad smiling
genially you were sports all through
and i should have hated to lag you and
after all there was a certain justice in your
getting even with profiteers

  with a smile he left them and when he
had gone cyprian said dreamily

  yes i felt that that fire would wipe
out everything so i thought that if i went
back for a souvenir nobody would miss it
so i went back heres your present

saturday on a circus means long
lines in front of the treasury-wagon
the mighty maxwell was like other
circuses saturday meant pay-day max-
well sat at the window which fkced the
razorbacks the roughnecks the animals
and punks while at the other pay-
ing off the performers was honest john
barker fixer and stockholder it was
the first pay-day of the spring following
the opening of the circus a week before
and the index-cards showed many entries
finally honest john smiled down at the
boyish grinning young man who awaited
his pay-envelope

  joe he said cordially i knew when
i signed you up that you were the worlds
worst clown but i didnt know you were
this bad three fines in one week thats
going some

  the young man chuckled

  not bad for a poor boy trying to get
along but then-

  whereupon he closed one eye and nod-
ded toward the back of old man maxwell
at the other side of the cage honest john
grinned and passed him out the remainder
of hisbalary joe bainter the clown went
whistling away giving evidence that the
infliction of three fines during the first week
of his engagement had not affected him in
the slightest honest john continued at his
work of doling out the cash

  card after card passed through his hands



as the performers came and went thrr
john blinked again and leaned out of his
window to stare down into the pretty face
of jennie maxwell of the high wire-the
old mans daughter

 what have you been doing he whis-
 pered as a smile twitched at the corner of
 his lips

i she looked at him curiously
nothing why

 your dads marked three fines against
 you

 a small foot stamped angrily

yes the mean old thing

 honest john wagged a finger

look out there jen hes your
dad

 i dont care hes a mean old thing
 and-

whats that it was a voice from
behind the fixer turned hurriedly with
a stage grin

just making jen apologize she got
mad at me yesterday and i wouldnt give
her any money today until she told me she
didnt mean a thing

 oughtnt to have it anyhow the way
 shes been carrying on the paternal
 growl carried the piqued displeasure that
 only a parent can know honest john
 leaned far out the window and whispered

 beat it

the girl departed hastily the dis-
bursing of the pay-roll went wearily on
exploits of an honest grafter



finally to cease honest john leaned back
in his chair and dusted a few cigar-ashes
from his otherwise immaculate clothing

  boss he inquired casually as max-
well turned at last from his window and
reached for his dead cigar ive figured up
that account

  what account

  my expense money for last year enter-
tainment of officials new hats for sheriffs
dresses for constables wives and so forth

it runs just nine thousand four hundred
dollars

  huh the old man turned all the
way in his chair and shifted the cigar-stub
to a corner of his mouth you dont ex-
pect me to pay that do you

  i sure do

  well you aint going to get it

  i spent it didnt i honest john toy-
ing with his lions-claw watchcharm was
staring at the paneled ceiling

   i didnt tell you to

  sure not im supposed to use my own
judgment to make money for the show
yeh and money for yourself you own
thirty per cent of the stock

  thats right

then shut up i suppose im going to
take money out of my own pocket to-
wait a minute honest john waved
a hand over his head dont get excited
about it i just thought id ask

  maxwell growled

  you found out

  i sure did

the fixer grinned and shrugged his
 shoulders downtown he went to a
complacent dinner two hours later just
as the shadows were deepening about the
circus lot and its spreading tents he picked
his way over the ropes and stakes sur-
rounding the big top and stopped a few
feet from the pad-room entrance he
called softly and a figure headed toward
the dressing-tent changed its course a
moment later honest john barker and joe
bainter the clown had ducked under the
sidewall of the big top and stood grinning
at each other in the dim light beneath the
reserved seats

  whats the big excitement honest
john asked the question and joe bainter
grinned

  he caught us talking together

  and fined you each time

that isnt all the first time he fired
me cold told me to get off the show and

the blue

never show up again-that hed suspected
something of the kind all the time that
brought on the fireworks from jen and she
said shed never speak to him again that
he was a cruel unkind father and other
warranted remarks of that kind and he
shut up then in a very paternal way he
pulled the rules of the show on us about
girls and men from the troupe going out
together and informed us with tears in his
eyes that hed have to fine us both

  going to run you off the show by fining
you to death huh

  yep joe bainter grinned again
then suddenly he became serious look
here mr barker he said quietly ive
put myself in your hands i love jen and
i love her with all the sincerity in the
world whats more shell marry me-
shes told me so and i dont see why i
shouldnt go to maxwell and-

  listen kid the minute you go to
maxwell you kill your little game as dead
as a doornail not that theres anything
objectionable about you-as far as i know
youre as fine a kid as i ever saw but
youve got to admit that even i dont know
anything about you-except that youve
got a million and want to marry the old
mans little girl you could talk to him
until you were black in the face and it
would only get you into trouble he doesnt

want jen to marry anybodyhow

much do you love jen

  as much as any man possibly could

  thats easy to say somehow or other
after youve been in the fixing game awhile
you get so you dont pay much attention to
words the real thing that counts is ac-
tion do you love her enough to-lose
her

 the young man gasped to-to
what

  to lose her honest john laid a
kindly hand on the other mans shoulder
look here joe jennies only a girl yet
this is the first real love-affair shes ever
had and a girl sometimes lets infatuation
get the better of her judgment its all
been very romantic and story-booky-you
with your millions and me fixing things so
you could come on the show as a clown
and not telling papa and all that sort of
thing-and it may have hit harder than
we supposed so isnt it fair to her and
fair to her father and fair to yourself to
give her a chance to wake up youve in-
timated to me that you are a regular he-
man now prove it
book magazine

there was silence for a moment then

how

  i think jen ought to go away
away there was a note of sudden
fright in the voice for how long
until i decide that its time for her to
come back

  but i can write to her

  nope not a line

  nor she to me

  thats a different matter i cant pre-
vent her doing that-if she wants to
but i cant write to her

  no and you cant explain why youre
not writing its a real test-are you game
for it the sound of breath whistling
through clenched teeth was the only an-
swer honest john tightened his grip on
the young mans shoulder listen joe
shes only a little kid-remember that
were never sorry for a little anguish if it
leads to the right sort of thing suppose
you should argue jen into running away
some night and marrying you-and sup-
pose she should find out a few months later
chat she didnt really love you thatd be
sne wouldnt it or suppose you should
come to the same conclusion yourself
howd you like it nope joe youre
the right sort of a fellow-at least i think
you are and if you really are youll pick
a quarrel with jen tomorrow 

 but-

  thats the whole story joe the rest
of its got to be up to me-and to your-
selves i dont know how its going to turn
out and i cant promise one solitary thing
but i know this im a fixer by trade and
if the loves still there and the faiths still
there some way somehow ill live up to
my reputation are you game

  the silence this time was longer than
ever but at last came the young mans
voice husky and strained

  i guess i love her-even enough to do
that mr barker

  fine see that you do it-and good
luck

  a slap on the back a clasp of the hand
then honest john shoved the clown out
under the sidewall and turned in the oppo-
site direction late that night just as the
second section was pulling out for the long
run to the next town he came casually
into maxwells office in the managerial car
a bundle of magazines under one arm and
slumped into a wicker chair the old man
looked over his shoulder and grunted
honest john grinned cheerily

by william o grenolds



   havent changed your mind yet about
 that expense-account

   nope

    oh all right just thought id ask
 he leaned back in his chair and turned
 to the advertising pages magazine after
 magazine he consumed while the train
 thumped along on its twenty-mile-an-hour
 pace over a rough roadbed at last the
 final periodical poised in one hand he
 looked quizzically up at maxwell

   boss he asked casually which do
 you think is the best school for young
 women briarlake or westercote

   for what

    for a sort of finishing touch you know
the final polish and all that sort of thing
the old man his cigar jammed tight in
a corner of his mouth turned peevishly

   how in-whatre you asking me about
 it for

   well i just thought youd be inter-
 ested

   me a heavy hand fanned aimlessly
 whatve i got to do with girls schools
 honest john regarded his lions claw

   nothing i guess only i know if i
was a father id at least be interested in
the school my daughter was going to
huh whats that is she-
theres been some talk about it hon-
est john agreed truthfully and since shes
 been kind of interested in this pet clown of
mine i rather thought-

    a banging fist on the desk interrupted
 maxwell whirled in his chair

   gad ill give a hundred to the bird
 who can work it

    couldnt o k that little expense-ac-
 count

   shut up

    honest john shrugged his shoulders
 well if thats the case i wont fool
 around with a measly hundred id rather
 work it for nothing but listen-not a
 cheep out of you until she springs it her-
 self get me then youre the surprised
 but indulgent father

   im anything just so-

    you dont have to pay me that expense-
 account meanwhile-im going to bed

 trouble was distinctly present bag
 bird-cage and baggage when honest
 john strolled on to the circus lot just after
 the arrival of the parade the next morning
 to find a nervous joe bainter pacing the
 sawdust in front of the marquee his face
 was white his hands clenched tight behind
exploits of an honest grafter	the blue



his back honest john blocked his path
and stared genially down at him

  well have you pulled it already
me the millionaire clown gasped i
didnt have a chance she beat me to it 
she it was honest johns turn to
blink now bainter went on

  jealousy just plain jealousy she
wanted to know who i met under the re-
served seats last night can you beat it
saw us go under eh

  she said she saw me turn away when
somebody called to me and thought she
saw a woman in the shadows

  gosh honest john grinned they
sure mut have been deep shadows-if i
looked like a woman whatd you say
me i told her the truth-that is not
all of it but i said i was talking to yoj
and that i could prove it

  foolish boy because im going to
tell her another story

 what

  then honest johns tone changed

  you promised joe

  the young mans lips went grim his
hands clenched tighter than ever

  i didnt think then that itd be a real
quarrel

  youre not going to play the quitter
i-i dont think im built that way i
gave you my promise ill keep it
thanks kid im almost tempted to-
but i wont youre off for today go
down to the cars or a picture-show any-
where just so you dont stay around this
circus lot playing tag with temptation itll
be a different story tomorrow well be
a hundred miles away and shell be gone
ill see to that be game kid so long
until later

  honest john gripped the clowns arm
and purposely dicfnot hear the stumbling
words which came from his lips then for
a moment he stood watching the dejected
figure as it moved from the lot he
sighed then straightened

  the bitterest medicines usually the
best he mused as he started for the dress-
ing tent there old molly the wardrobe
woman who had always taken a motherly
interest in jennie signaled him

   tis a divils owntime im havin
she confided wit little jinnie shes in
there crying out her hear-rt and if her
fayther finds it out-

  forget it honest john patted her
shoulder forget it molly and lead me
to her

a moment later honest john and
 jennie maxwell were sitting in close
conversation within the wardrobe womans
little partition of the dressing-tent and
honest john was exceedingly busy with
his watchcharm

   yep came in answer to the inevitable
question ive seen joe he asked me to
tell you something

   about last night there was hope in
the voice honest john nodded very se-
riously

  yes-something about us being to-
gether

  well-

   listen jennie dont you think you
ought to take a little trip-somewhere
but i tvant to know about last night
were you with him-was that you who
called to him

   honest john still twirled his watch-
charm

   look here jennie he said at last
im a truthful man but i wouldnt tell
you now-if id been with him honest
i wouldnt im not going to say either
way if i was with him then youre all
to blame and you ought to be ashamed of
yourself for being jealous and if i
wasnt with him it might have been some
other man and-well so im not going to
say anything except that-youre going
away

  i she gasped slightly where-
why

   because i think it best

you mean-its something about joe
honest john nodded a new outburst
of tears streamed down the girls cheeks
honest john gritted his teeth and inwardly
called himself names but he persisted

   yes its about joe i guess you two
had better try the climate away from eath
other

 then there was something wrong
the girlish anger returned -i knew it all
the time i knew-

   i told you before the quiet voice of
honest john interrupted that i wouldnt
be the one to break the news no matter
what it was im just giving you a little
suggestion your father and you are going
to take a little trip tonight when he comes
back youre going to stay behind im
thinking jen that youve never had quite
enough schooling-you know the finishing
touches and about a year down at briar-
lake ought to work wonders and who can
tell this other thing may turn out all
book magazine

right then of course it may turn out all
wrong-but if it is going to do anything
like that its better to have it over with as
quickly as possible

  and listen- he poked a finger at her
-im the fixer for all this ill handle
your father understand im going to
make him believe that this is something
that you and ive been cooking up for
some timer see thatll take all the un-
pleasantness away from it-he wont know
youve had a quarrel with joe or that
theres anything disagreeable at all get
me so put a cold cloth or a hot cloth
or whatever you use on those eyes and
take the swelling out of em i never liked
to see a pretty girl cry anyway and look
for your dad and myself back here in a cou-
ple of hours

dut if honest john had figured that to
be the end of the conversation he
was mistaken it was only the beginning
and it was not until a long hour later that
he emerged from the dressing-tent to hunt
up maxwell and tell him that his daugh-
ter had taken a sudden resolution toward
schooling nor was it until the train pulled
out that night bearing maxwell and a lip-
biting daughter away to briarlake that
honest john felt at all comfortable had
he overplayed his hand

  the next day joe bainter sought him
out

  have you heard anything joes face
was slightly paler than usual

  honest john shook his head sorry
old kid but i cant give you any infor-
mation

  but you can at least tell me where you
took her

  no you might let temptation get
away from you i dont want any letters
going there

  the young man turned and walked
slowly away and honest john again
called himself names

  three days went by and maxwell came
back grinning and happy a certain little
eventuality which had been troubling him
seemed far in the distance now he was
even civil-which was saying a great deal
for the old man honest john sought the
circus postman

  anything for joe bainter

  the postman pulled out a fat letter
honest john looked at the writing and
smiled then whispered to the postman
the postman grinned understanding

by william o grenolds



  it isnt exactly according to rules but
if its for the best- he wavered

  you can take my word for that hon-
est john dropped the letter into his pocket
and went to the cars there he again took
it forth looked at the writing on the en-
velope and smiled in a quizzical way i
hope im playing the right cards he re-
flected as he laid the letter carefully away

the next day honest john met the post-
man again but the man shook his
head and again the next-and for days
afterward honest john squinted then
ambled in the direction of clown alley
there he singled out joe bainter and sidled
to him his eyes became accusing
youve been hearing from jen

  the man stared

  if i only had but i havent i
hoped-honestly i thought that shed
write to me and tell me she was sorry but
nothing came i guess she meant it when
she said shed never have anything to do
with me again i-

  how about you

  me theres nothing except that im
sorry-for everything if thatll do any
good it wasnt my fault but-im sorry
im-

  but im afraid that wont help nope
joe youve got to wait and if waiting
wont help then its better all the way round
to find it out now and to have your suffer-
ing before the real trouble sets in

  following which honest john walked
away-but there was a little look of worri-
ment in his eyes as he did so a look which
intensified as a week passed a week in
which honest john met the mail-carrier
each morning only to receive a negative
reply	

  two months passed by honest john
developed a glorious case of insomnia
then one afternoon as he sought vainly to
nap there came a knock on his door and
the admission call brought in joe bainter
joe was thin now his cheeks were sunken
there was something about the man which
caused honest john to turn his head and
to grit his teeth for honest john knew
in his heart that he had been the cause
the fixer extended a hapd

  bainter he said slowly im sorry
i thought things would turn out differ-
ently honest i did

  then youve not heard anything
either

  not a word she was spunkier than i
exploits of an honest grafter

thought she was i fully believed joe
that there would be a deluge of letters for
both of us and that everything would be
lovely but its better as it is kid-if
this thing was going to develop later shes
only a child you might say-nineteens
not so very old youve never had a line-
on your word of honor

  not a line

  did you ever get any telegrams

  not one mr barker i-i dont think
id be looking like this if i had

  honest john rose and laid a hand on
the young mans shoulder

  youve at least got the satisfaction of
knowing that youve played a mans game
and that youve made a friend wholl never
forget you-if thatll do any good

  well and joe bainters voice was
husky that isnt exactly what ive been
wishing for i appreciate it just the same
and you still love her joe

  more than ever

  honest john paced the small confines of
his stateroom

  -i-i thought it was going to be differ-
ent joe i-i- he looked toward the
desk which sheltered that lone letter re-
ceived shortly after jens departure and
his lips almost framed a confession no
i was going to tell you something-but i
wont now it wouldnt do much good and
it might do a lot of harm for the
thought had come suddenly into honest
johns brain that theenvelope in his desk
might contain something far different from
what he had believed when he had taken it
from the postman im afraid joe that
she woke up

  you mean that she decided that she
didnt love me after all

  just about joe

  well the young man sighed i guess
you were right-that its better to know
it now than after wed done something
foolish that we couldnt undo without a lot
more heartaches my business at home
has been running pretty much tc seed mr
barker i guess-

  that youd better go back

  yes

  its beginning to look that way joe
but well wait a while longer and see what
turns up i thought shed write to me-
he was talking in the jerky sentences of a
disappointed man-but shes never even
written a line not a-

  he stopped suddenly outside the car
some one was calling his name excit-

the blue



edly a moment more and a workman had
hurried into the room

  mr barker the old man wants you
up at the lot right away the chariot
turned over in the races and jimmed up
three men

  badly hurt

  one of em is the other two are just
skinned up the old man says to get up
there and square up their accounts for
them so that they can either be left behind
or sent home

  honest john reached for his memoran-
dum book

  got their names

  yes sir bill edward harry layton
and joe masters

  thanks honest john was scribbling
tell mr maxwell ill be up there in a
few minutes

two hours later honest john stood at
the marquee of the circus tent breath-
ing easy after his work of squaring a
messenger-boy scrambled through the
small crowd in front of the side-show and
handed him a message quietly honest
john read it then walked into the
menagerie

  seen joe bainter he queried of a
fellow-clown

  yes sir just left him

  get him and tell him i want to see
him

  a wait of five minutes then a whispered
conversation joe bainter hurried away
honest john strolled through the menag-
erie stood watching for a moment as the
chandelier men adjusted the lights for the
night then turned toward the cars fif-
teen minutes later he roamed into max-
wells office and easing himself into a chair
puffed contentedly at his cigar at last
he yawned and leaned forward

  going to be minus a good clown to-
morrow

  who the old man was busy at his
books

  joe bainter

  so wheres he going

  leaving the show tonight paid him
off an hour or so ago he was in a hurry
so i gave him money out of my own
pocket hes going to get married

  who to

  your daughter

  what the-who the-how the-where
do you get that stuff the old man had
turned and was making a double windmill
book magazine	by william o grenolds



of his arms hes not going to do any
such thing wheres a timetable around
here ive got ten thousand dollars that
says he isnt going to marry my daughter
found that timetable yet

  whatd you say about ten thousand
honest john continued to puff amiably
wheres that timetable

  id be pretty near willing to bet that
hes going to pull it off i-

  whatre you trying to do stall me
gi me that timetable wheres-

  looking for the time of a train to briar-
lake it leaves at eight oclock i heard
joe say so

  is he taking it

  couldnt prove it by me

  well ill be on it ill- the old
man was fussing about the office talking
to himself ten thousand dollars says
that he doesnt marry any daughter of
mine get me a telegraph blank so i can
wire to the chief of police at briarlake to
choke off the marriage license and to tip
off everybody ten thousand dollars-
well put up or shut up exclaimed
honest john in an exasperated voice a he
shoved the telegraph-pad into maxwells
hands id lose ten thousand just to know
youd stopped raving

  the old man was scribbling hastily

  its up he snapped my words
good now tear out and get me a ticket
and berth to briarlake and make it
snappy i havent got much time

  just forty-five minutes said honest
john as he looked at his watch want
me to send that telegram too

  yeh and give the operator a five-
dollar bill for rushing it now put on the
speed

a ut went honest john thirty min-
 utes later the old man followed they
met on the station platform the train
pulled in a form hurried forward and
boarded it almost before it stopped-joe
bainter the old man gave one look then
jabbed forth a hand excitedly

  so long john watch after things for
me while im gone im going to stop that
marriage if i-

  board-d-d-d-d

  a wild scramble forward and the old
man crawled up the steps of the train
entirely failing to notice that a young man
dropped off the back end and moved hur-
riedly away honest john waved a hand
good luck he shouted

  the train moved on so did honest
john-back to his work of the circus lot
back to the task of getting the show out of
town and on its journey to the next stand
next morning he was at a railroad station
again to its roaring stop came a passen-
ger train while honest john suddenly
craning his neck waved a welcoming hand
and ran forward

  hello jen bless you he exclaimed
as a white-faced girl came out of a vesti-
bule lets hurry look here why
didnt you write that boy

  write she straightened proudly
i did-the first thing and asked him to
forgive me and he didnt answer he
couldnt expect me to write after that could
he no matter how much i loved him
then with a sudden anxiety

  how is he is he seriously injured
injured honest john stared who
said he was injured

  well isnt he

  of course not

  but-but she fished in her bag-
didnt you send me this telegram
honest john looked at the piece of paper
and read the word aloud

  joe very much hurt needs you wire
if you can come at once-but dont come
unless you still love him and are willing to
marry him john barker

  carefully the fixer folded the message
and handed it back to her

  sure i sent the telegram but i always
was bad about using ambiguous words i
didnt mean he was injured but just what
i said-that he was hurt his feelings
you know see now here-come back
here-ill explain the whole thing jen
do you hear me come back here this
minute that boys all right and- he
beamed as she came again to his side
smiling and happy thats a good girl
thirty-six hours later honest john again
sat in maxwells office looking at a check
for ten thousand dollars

  reconciled yet he asked of the
grumpy individual at the desk

  nope

  not even with a millionaire son-in-law
and a personal guarantee from your fixer
that hes the best of the best

  oh shut up

  not even with a clear conscience about
paying your principal stockholder an
amount of money you really owed him
get out of here

  but the old man smiled when he said it

in that portion of the speakers gallery
at the south end of the house of com-
mons which is reserved for visiting
peers a dozen or more distinguished
noblemen had come in from the upper
house to hear sir templeton bramvilles
speech on the polish crisis and the govern-
ment policies in the group were a duke
and two marquesses but the men to whose
opinions the others appeared to defer be-
cause of their wide experience in interna-
tional affairs during the war were lord
trevor earl of dyvnaint and his friend
for many years viscount lammerford of
st ives lammerford had been formerly
associated with the foreign office as dean
of the kings messengers and was said to
know moreyjeople in public life than any
other man living the earl had a mag-
nificent record for hazardous details as rear
admiral under secret orders from the ad-
miralty and had done a great deal of
spectacular work in aviation-and had
been also prominent in the adjustment of
labor troubles since the armistice but
neither though generally classed as states-
men from their wide knowledge of public
affairs was really supposed to be active in
the government itself the group were
discussing a vague rumor which had been
creeping about westminster that after-
noon	



  i say trevor do you fancy there
might be anything in it-eh bramvilles
a bit late with his speech even now of
course hes not the sort to be intimidated
-no fear but-eh might consider it
advisable to modify a bit-what

  faith if he does that he would better
not go into the matter at all situations
this were understood to back poland an
roumania with money munitions an sup-
plies against any aggression upon the part
of russia or germany france the same
but if the soviet armies appear likely to
wipe poland out altogether or reduce her to
something like vassalage its a menace to
the civilized world thatll require a deal
more than passive resistance-unless
checked itll set the whole world on fire
again well we have now a tacit agree-
ment from moscow to call off their armies
from the polish border if we renew com-
mercial relations with em weve threat-
ened to blockade em if they break this
agreemnt suppose they do-eh one
cant trust that crew even while theyre
signin agreemnts what then blockade
em aye but if they keep on eatin
into poland-eh well-thats sir tem-
pletons point dye see an hes been
warned by anonymous letter not to bring
it up on the floor of the house threats
dye see what
free lances in diplomacy

a member rose from the second tier
 of the opposition benches on the east
side of the house and talked for ten min-
utes or so in a stammering hesitating way
in favor of nationalizing all the coal-mines
and railway-systems-getting a demonstra-
tion of agreement with his views as he
sat down again much to the surprise of
the noblemen in the speakers gallery

  i say lammerford youre by way of
knowin pretty much everybody whos
the chap on the opposition side

  simon clapp-new member just re-
turned from one of the manchester bor-
oughs laborite of course serious point
to me is the amount of backin his ideas
are getting looks as if there were in-
cessant propaganda along those lines and
that it has begun to affect men with some
thinkin capacity-men who know better
when theyre not swept off their feet an
common sense by glittering theories an
generalities i fancy bramvilles been
workin up to this point all through his
public career hes spent a lot of thought
on this speech in order to present gov-
ernmnts views not only upon the polish
question as they see it but upon the fal-
lacy of nationalized industries in a democ-
racy as wellah the member

from manchester was evidently his cue-
the opening hed been waiting for see
thats sir templeton getting up from the
ministerial benches now well have it
it was quite evident that the baronets
presentation of the governments position
had been most carefully prepared that the
moment was one of the greatest in his po-
litical life bramville was admittedly
skilled in debate-an easy and convincing
talker with a magnetic personality as
he proceeded with his orderly summing up
of the european situation there was at
first some heckling from the opposition
benches-but this presently subsided in the
absorbing interest of his speech when he
finally sat down there was a general tribute
to his personality and parliamentary abil-
ity but in it there was an undercurrent of
disagreement with the governments views
some one moved the question of a test
division-not necessarily final but as the
basis of arbitration with the opposition-
and the members filed out into the east and
west lobbies to be counted members
supporting the government adjourn to the
lobby immediately back of the government
benches on the west side those of the
opposition go into a similar lobby back of

by clarence herbert new



the east-side benches-to be counted after
a division as they filed out earl trevor
gave a sharp exclamation of disgust

  lammerford is right gentlemen there
must have been a deal of poisonous prop-
aganda among the very men we most nat-
urally trust theres an influence at work
which must be combatted with all our avail-
able force an intelligence or well go to
pieces from the inside-as a certain con-
tinental state would jolly well like to have
us do bramvilles motion has failed on
this test division glance at the crowd
goin out with the opposition countin
em is a mere farce were not yet com-
mitted to nationalization of the mines and
industries an weve not openly said well
permit soviet russia to obliterate poland
an roumania but thats what may hap-
pen unless we get to the root of all this an
stamp it out

  more than that i caught a word or
two from the floor-through this dicta-
phone i was using-which makes me
fancy that sir templeton may be in per-
sonal danger it was a masterly speech
which the members will mull over for days
to come-likely enough to change a good
many of the present views an votes after
they reconsider iti say lam-
merford an one or two of you come
along with me an join bramville as he
goes out ill feel better to see him as far
as his town residence at all events-the
news-sheets will be on the streets with his
speech in a few moments come along 

with three others earl trevor and
 lammerford hurried down through
westminster hall and the members exit
opening upon new palace yard but sir
templeton bramville was some little dis-
tance ahead of them with two of the gov-
ernment whips who left him in front of
st margarets church after that he pro-
ceeded down the broad sanctuary in the
direction of victoria street alone one of
the five remembered hearing that bram-
ville was dining with some of the govern-
ment party at the westminster palace ho-
tel that evening they were increasing
their pace to catch up with the statesman
when they saw him pause near the north-
west corner of the abbey and partly raise
his left arm as if trying to ward off a
blow there was no other person within
a hundred feet of him as it happened
quick glances in every direction failed to
discover anyone making a threatening mo-
free lances in diplomacy

tion toward the man-there was no report
of rifle or pistol that trevor or his com-
panions heard subconsciously they fancied
that somebody coughed in the immediate
vicinity as if from a bronchial cold-but
they never thought of trying to locate him
their attention was concentrated upon
bramville-who had stopped short and was
swaying on his feet as if ill in another
moment he crumpled down upon the pave-
ment	 il
trevor who was the first to reach him
saw a spreading stain upon bramvilles
waistcoat and a slowly increasing pool upon
the pavement with trevors usual grasp
of the situation in emergencies he saw that
the wound was a dangerous one-that
prompt action alone could save the bar-
onets life but it was lammerford who
began to suspect a further complication
which had not occurred to the earl bend-
ing down until he could sniff at the bloody
waistcoat it seemed to the viscount that
he noticed a faint peculiar odor

  my word the scoundrels fully in-
tended any wound to be fatal in this case
whether it happened to be in a vital place
or not i fancy therell be little question
that the bullet was poisoned 

  if thats the case declared trevor
theres but one man in london who may
save him sir pelham curran-the sur-
geon who specializes in toxic wounds and
gets a hundred guineas for a mere exam-
ination will one of you step to the near-
est phone and have them put you on to
his house hell be either at home or at
the savage i fancy-has a lot of friends
among the writers your grace if that
was your landaulet parked near the yard
it will serve us better than waiting for an
ambulance currans private hospital is
over yon in berkeley street-we can make
iiin ten minutes your car is a particu-
larly easy-riding one

i aying the statesman upon the wide
- rear seat of the dukes landaulet they
got him to sir pelham currans small but
famous operating hospital with very little
jolting and without entire loss of conscious-
ness a numbness had succeeded the first
shock of the wound--but trevor knew
from its -location that he would be suffer-
ing horribly in half an hour the cele-
brated surgeon had been found at the sav-
age club and when informed over the wire
that the earl of dyvnaint was specially
requesting his services promptly agreed to

the blue



come at once reaching his hospital within
a few minutes after them he hurried up
to the operating-room where his assistant
-summoned by phone-was already pre-
paring to anesthetize the patient

  as bramville was still suffering no pain
though strangely weak and faint sir tem-
pleton nervously begged them to wait a
little while before taking any definite ac-
tion the sight of the attendant nurses
the surgeon and the anesthetician-the
lower part of their faces masked in antisep-
tic gauze and long sterilized aprons cov-
ering their clothing completely-gave him
a feeling of helpless horror that he had
never experienced in the trenches during
the war but a few words from sir cur-
ran though pleasant and soothing were
apparently final-and he made no further
resistance when the cone was placed over
his nose and mouth

  as far as one may judge from the
position of your wound sir templeton its
in a particularly dangerous locality if
you wish to live-as we assume that you
do-it is necessary to find where that bul-
let has lodged get it out and sterilize every
portion of the tissue it has touched un-
der ether this will not disturb you in the
least-though naturally there will be
more or less pain when you recover con-
sciousness now-if you will just relax
comfortably on the table and breathe nat-
urally the sensation will be merely that of
dropping off into a pleasant sleep then i
will do everything that science has taught
me to remedy your misfortune inciden-
tally i wish to express my very great ap-
preciation of your masterly summing-up
for govemmnt on the floor of the house
an hour ago it cannot fail to have a far-
reaching influence

  this tribute to the great effort of his
political life so pleased bramville that he
forgot for an instant or two his dangerous
condition and lost consciousness before he
realized what was happening for the next
hour and a half the great surgeon and
his assistant-himself a rising specialist-
worked in tense silence broken only by
occasional muttered instructions to the
nurses

an the second floor earl trevor and his
friends waited in the room which two
other nurses were preparing for the
wounded statesman-speculating upon his
chances for recovery and the political en-
mity which had prompted such a dastardly
book magazine

attempt upon his life at the end of two
hours which dragged until they seemed
more like six they heard the elevator de-
scending from the operating-room it
stopped at the second floor and the cart
was trundled out with a motionless sheet-
covered form which the nurses very care-
fully lifted off upon the white-iron bed
which had been prepared with rubber and
draw-sheets for several moments they
were busy over the slowly breathing un-
conscious man then they left the room as
sir pelham came down and closed the
door after he had entered there was a
tense silence-the noblemen glancing at the
great surgeon questioningly

  well gentlemen he may have about
one chance in three if his lordship of
dyvnaint hadnt fetched him here at once
hed have been gone before this the
mushroom bullet from a mauser was
coated with the same chemical poison used
by the boches at second ypres it was
lodged in the gall-bladder-which i re-
moved together with a small portion of the
liver and some of the tissue along the
course of the bullet ive given three hy-
podermics of a solution calculated to coun-
teract the spread of the poison through the
circulation if i was in time-and suc-
ceed in checking the thing before it reaches
the heart-he will be in no more danger-
ous condition than anyone undergoing such
an operation who shot him

  thats what nobody is likely to know
unless he recovers and can tell us what it
was he saw just before he was hit there
was no sound of a shot-no powder-smoke
anywhere in sight that we could discover
which of course indicates the use of a
silencer upon the muzzle of the mauser
from his position at the momentthe shot
could have come from some window in
westminster abbey or the royal aquarium
-possibly from a window at the extreme
point of the westminster palace hotel
though id eliminate that as most improb-
able there was a rumor going about this
afternoon that he had received threatening
anonymous letters warning him against any
suggestion of assisting poland or rouma-
nia-opposition to the scheme for national-
izing mines an railways any sort of oppo-
sition to irish independence in order to
catch every word distinctly in the speakers
gallery where we were sitting i used a
pocket dictaphone and when the members
went out for the division i caught a few
muttered threats against bramville his

by clarence herbert new



speech was so masterly a summin up for
governmnt on all those questions dye see
that i fancy they feared its effect through-
out the country

  you think bramville may have seen the
man who shot him

  quite positive he was going at a
brisk walk toward the hotel where he was
dining this evening when he almost
stopped and raised his left arm as if ward-
ing off a blow must have ben hit a
second or two afterward of course with
nobody in sight who appeared to be actin
suspiciously there was no attempt made
to run down the assassin-could be none
the scoundrel got safely away but if
bramville describes him an his position
at the moment the chance of catching him
is by no means hopeless

  he may do that even if we cant save
him in about an hour hell be coming out
of the anesthetic-though hell be quite
too ill for clear thinking tonight in the
morning unless the temperature goes up
dangerously he may recognize the impor-
tance of telling us what he can

  you think hel not drop out before
that

  unless the poison spreads through the
circulation-no

  h-m-m-on the chance of things going
wrong with him i fancy that lammerford
an i had best stay the night but its
unnecessry to keep his grace and lord
garford we can give them an account of
whatever happens later eh

 i he duke and garford recognized the
seriousness of the affair and were of
half a mind to stay but upon second
thought had the uneasy impression that
bramvilles taking-off was likely to be
a deucedly unpleasant nervous strain if it
should prove that he had to go after all
so they inwardly welcomed trevors sug-
gestion and left the hospital

  at the end of another hour a faint moan
of pain came from the bed they saw that
bramvilles eyes were partly open but the
change in his appearance shocked even
men who had gone through the hell ofthe
german war bramvilles eyelids and the
flesh surrounding them were congested-
dark red in color the eyes themselves
had an expression of unutterable physical
torment the air of the room was reeking
with an impalpable fog of ether through
which the man was struggling for a con-
sciousness which brought with it unbear-
free lances in diplomacy

able pain sir pelham stood by the bedside
with his fingers upon the patients wrist-
speaking in low tones over his shoulder to
the others

   in most cases there is a great deal of
nausea from the ether when they come out
of it-due largely to their fighting against
the anesthetic when taken and getting
some into the stomach if bramville has
much of it well not save him-the retch-
ing will produce inflammation considering
the toxic conditions along the course of the
bullet but he went under very quietly-
im hoping we may get through without
that

   presently the statesman began to moan
im very ill-oh frightfully ill

  trevor bent down close to the pillow
with a few quiet words-assurances that
the pain would decrease somewhat within
the next few hours-and asked if the
wounded man recognized him

oh i know your lordship right
enough with me-just after-it hap-
pened but-im so-frightfully-ill
shall we send for lady bramville
weve telephoned her every hour

  oh-h-h-not yet no use cant talk
too beastly ill to think suffering horri-
bly trevor what had i ever done to that
bounder-with the silly beard all over his
face aimin as deliberately as if he were
stalkin deer up there in one of the ab-
bey windows knew id be cornin that
way spark of sun reflected from his
glasses-drew my attention ah-h-h-but
im suffering so thought i knew what
pain was-when i got it in the arm-over
yon but-nothing to-this

  was that bounder some one you knew
ever see him before

   so horribly ill the man yes
familiar face-something professional i
fancy not personal-acquaintance but
vaguely-familiar fellow one might see
occasionally-somewhere ah-h-h-h-doc-
tor cant you give me something stop
-suffering

  aye-but not altogether natures ef-
fort to repair the damage if we deaden
it too much the damage gains over nature
and we lose what weve worked for so hard
morphine or anesthetics slow down the
heart-action-mustnt go too far wit-h that 
stepping to the door sir pelham called
a nurse and instructed her to give the pa-
tient a hypodermic from a certain formula
of his own-then beckoned the two peers
out into the hall

the blue



  hell not be fully out from under the
effects of the anesthetic for another twenty
hours and will then have no recollection
of your having been in the room with him
or anything he has just said subcon-
sciously his mind may be clear enough at
this moment to remember details of the
shooting on the other hand it may be
pure imagination stimulated by the anes-
thetic you must decide for yourselves
how much reliance is to be placed upon
what is said-how much of probability
there may be in it from your own impres-
sions of the moment im a bit more hope-
ful now of pulling him through-though
its still a toss-up youll get nothing
more from him tonight i fancy-so per-
haps it may be as well to go home and
come again tomorrow afternoon eh

t was now after ten in the evening earl

  trevor had sent for one of his own cars
after dismissing that of the duke-and
hesitated a moment as they were about
stepping into it before the hospital there
was that about the afternoons occurrence
which stamped it both in his and lam-
merfords minds as something more than
isolated outrage it had more the appear-
ance of carefully-planned terrorism with
assassination as the alternative

  lammy said trevor i fancy were
thinkin along the same lines concernin
this affair-thinking it may be only a single
incident in something a deal more far-
reaching if that suspicion is well-founded
such a campaign might overturn the brit-
ish government unless something is
promptly done to counteract it basically
of course we believe the nation has too
firm a foundation of common sense to be
stampeded into anything like the russian
chaos yet dye see if the leaders at the
head of our governmnt should be killed
off one after another or intimidated until
they lose their nerve it would produce
months of utter confusion in which almost
anything might happen if theres more
at the bottom of this we should be able to
pick up a trace or two in other places be-
fore morning-eh question is-where are
the most likely spots to look for them

  lady forrestiers reception an dance
in portman square for one a number of
the members are sure to be there with
their wives-an curzon spoke of droppin
in this may prove more a foreign office
matter than anything in the home sec-
retarys departmnt
book magazine

  they were driven in a few moments to a
mansion on portman square where several
hundred of the more prominent men and
women were dancing or chatting as if
there were no longer any serious affairs to
harass the nation as both were immensely
popular the earl and lammerford had no
trouble in picking up partners but had one
been more than casually observant it
might have been noticed that both ladies
were the wives of members who had voted
with the opposition that afternoon though
usually on the side of government bits
of fragmentary talk between the earl and
his partner would have been even more il-
luminating

  er-rather surprised at beldens goin
over to the opposition dont you know
fancied him a strong supporter of the min-
isterial policies-what

  ill assume the blame for that if your
lordship pleases two of my brothers
were killed in the argonne-and my
father in the first belgian actions yester-
day my husband received a typed anony-
mous letter assuring him that he certainly
would be killed if he voted for sir tem-
pletons motion this afternoon-and i gave
him no peace until he promised to vote
against it how much would you ask of eng-
lish women anyway havent we sacri-
ficed enough as it is what real differ-
ence does a paltry vote make in time of
peace

  in this case my friend it might easily
rip the balance an plunge us into another
european war-or utter chaos at home i
see your point of course on the surface it
is well taken god knows you english-
women have sacrificed everything you hold
dear-and yet- well dye see one
couldnt imagine lady nan of dyvnaint
makin me promise to vote against my prin-
ciples or honest convictions one fancies
that her position would be vote what you
consider the best policy for the country-if
youre shot for it the next moment
threats of that sort always defeat them-
selves two or three valuable men may
be killed i grant you-but the people
soon get sufficiently stirred up to avenge
them an protect the others as a rule
threatened men live long at all events
one doesnt permit himself to be intimi-
dated by scum of that sort-an beldens
quite sure to reverse his vote upon recon-
sideration hes not really a coward you
know-jather not in fact ill wager
that youll tell him to do so tomorrow

an hour later the earl came upon eng-
lands foreign secretary in a corner
of the big library talking with viscount
lammerford and briefly outlined his con-
clusions from the affairs of the afternoon
and evening his excellency had been of
the opinion that bramvilles shooting was
purely a matter for scotland yard until
his attention was drawn to the attempted
intimidation of at least thirty prominent
members of parliament-and bramvilles
semiconscious description of the assassin
who had wounded him

  hmph as you put it trevor were in
for trouble-at a most unfortunate time
too affairs at home are frightfully un-
settled-the conferences at spa are any-
thing but satisfactory after the defeat
of bramvilles motion this afternoon our
foreign policy is up in the air have you
any suggestion to make concerning this
affair

  aye-that to say ive at least one
method of procedure fairly well blocked
out deuced pity weve not half a dozen
first-class men available in your depart-
mnt i could use em within the next
few days

  isnt your lordship unjustifiably se-
vere i fancied we had a number of really
first-chop men in the foreign office-sec-
ond to none in the world

  er-quite so but dye see theyre
scattered among all of the worlds capitals
where theyre jolly well needed but here
in london just the moment it would be
difficlt to find even two of the sort i could
use to advantage stop a bit youve
one man in downing street who might
show exceptional ability in this affair
young sir reginald whittlesey-

  hmph hes had but a clerical berth
with us since he was invalided home
aye because the chap has positive
genius for filing-systems an a memory
that amazes one its quite likely youve
not been sufficiently intrested in his record
to learn that he was one of the best intelli-
gence officers on the western front
h-m-m i say old chap an idea oc-
curs to me which might be worth tryin
out in your departmnt-because it would
show a number of your juniors what the
qualifications really are for serious work in
the intelligence departmnt an start em
perfectin themselves to qualify along those
lines suppose tomorrow morning you
turn over to me in one of the more se-
cluded downing street rooms some of the
free lances in diplomacy

men whom you consider promising mate-
rial ill talk to them about the service
an then make a few tests which ill wager
not more than one or two of the lot will
meet ill also wager that your file-clerk
reggie whittlesey will make a better
showing than any of the others eh are
you on ponies-if you wish

  something in his lordships manner and
suggestion intrigued the foreign secretary
he recognized the gravity of bramvilles
shooting and the campaign of intimidation
if the earls suspicions proved to be well
founded also the criticism of the men
available for home duty rankled a good
dealhe accepted the wager

yyhen trevor reached downing street
next morning he found nine of the
foreign office attaches waiting for him in
an upper chamber where an equal number
of blackboards had been placed along the
wall behind his chair-quite like a pro-
vincial schoolroom adjoining this was a
smaller room in which one of his afghan
household waited to assist him with several
changes of clothing

  he began at once by impressing upon
each man the fact that his life and safety
would frequently depend upon the extent
to which he had cultivated his power of
observation-also his ability to think and
plan quickly in emergencies to illustrate
these points the earl said that he pro-
posed giving them one or two impersona-
tions which he wished them to describe
minutely upon the blackboards

  everyone in england or the colonies
has done his bit in private theatricals at
house-parties of course-we british rather
fancy ourselves at that sort of thing an
they tell me im passably good at it so
ill step into the next room presently an
make up in different types of character
before doing this however i wish to make
a simpler test ive been talking to you
now for possibly twenty minutes-ample
time for close observation well when i
step out of the room you will all come
up to these blackboards an write a short
description of my personal appearance
with any peculiarities you may notice-
leaving space upon the boards for a couple
more descriptions underneath eh you
follow me

  he was gone so quickly that some of
them had not fully grasped his request be-
fore he disappeared and it was at least
two or three minutes before all were writ-

the blue



ing at the blackboards somehow the ap-
parently simple test presented difficulties
they had been giving the closest possible
attention to what he said-not the clothes
he wore or how he looked they had seen
him hundreds of times each had talked
with him more than once offhand they
would unhesitatingly have described him to
another person with confidence that they
were right in every essential particular
now however they were by no means sure
when he returned five minutes later some
of them were still at the boards and had
written very little standing by the first
board he turned and faced them-motion-
ing for a comparison between his appear-
ance and what had been written on it the
result was amazing in no single partic-
ular had the f o man hit it right it
seemed impossible that he could have
looked at his lordship and formed so
completely erroneous a mental picture

  on the next board he was described as
smoothly shaven-blue eyes-height about
five feet ten-wearing a black cut-away
coat with trousers a shade lighter the
smooth face was the only detail correct
at the third board however his lordship
paused his features were described in de-
tail with considerable accuracy-his cos-
tume as a navy-blue sack coat and trousers
with tan spats and shoes the name signed
at the top of the board was that of an irre-
pressible young fellow under thirty who
apparently had been paying scant attention
to what the earl said and had whispered a
good deal to his neighbor on the left the
seventh board was that of sir reginald
whittlesey and it differed from the other
only in a more careful description of real
height features and the color of the suit
which he stated to be a dark bluish-green
as the clothes were unquestionably navy-
blue in the excellent light from the win-
dows and as the earl was so perfectly pro-
portioned that none of them took him for
an inch over five feet ten it seemed ob-
vious that whittlesey also had failed in
some essential particulars-but to their
amazement he said

  i fancy my description of your lord-
ships clothes was correct though you are
now wearing navy blue by actual meas-
urement you stand a bit over six feet in
your socks-possibly a half-inch

  you stick to those points do you
whittlesey

  i certainly do sir may be mistaken
of course-but i fancy not
book magazine

  what do you say canning-turning
to the irrepressible who had been so nearly
right

  as you are now sir my description
would fit-but im inclined to think cap-
tain whittlesey was right you changed
your suit while we were writing on the
boards hes also nearer the mark than
i on your height-now that i look at you
more closely with other objects about the
room for comparison

  youre both quite sure about these
points

  aye sir-positive as one can be in the
circumstances quite sure your lord-
ship

  very good i congratulate you both-
particularly as the test came most unex-
pectedly fancy that was what floored
you other chaps-though ill admit that i
purposely distracted your attention now
ill go out again an return in possibly ten
minutes made up as a different type alto-
gether will give you two minutes in
which to study my appearance carefully
that may be a long time-or very short
depending upon your amount of concen-
tration put the subject out of your minds
while i am gone but assume that your
lives may depend upon your being alert
when i come in

a little more than ten minutes later
 the door opened a man stepped
partly into the room to inquire if the earl
of dyvnaint was there being told that
the earl would return presently he said
he would wait-and remained standing at
the front end of the room although he
had spoken with no perceptible accent his
appearance was that of a middle-class ger-
man-the shopkeeping sort his clothes
were baggy his manner and person slov-
enly his beard ragged his hair close-
cropped his eyes small and piercing his
linen noticeably soiled-fingernails ditto
ordinarily they would have told him the
room was being used for a private confer-
ence-but as his lordship would quickly
get rid of the bounder when he returned
they paid little attention to him at the
end of two minutes however he drew out a
cheap silver watch glanced at the time
said that he couldnt wait any longer
would they please tell the earl that he had
called just as he was closing the door
he said

  pe sure you wass descripe me so as
der earl he know who wass here ja

by clarence herbert new



berhaps you petter write him on der plack-
poardts-shust how i look-undt tese
clos how tey look ja

 in stupefaction they stared at each
other then canning the seemingly inat-
tentive one jumped for one of the black-
boards with the remark

 i say you chaps that was pretty
good advice take the tip-dont lose a
second his lordship is likely to come in
before youre ready as it is

  in their disgust at the strangers dis-
reputable appearance they had noted most
of the objectionable details without ap-
pearing to stare at him and so were able
to write out pretty accurate descriptions
and after glancing at what the other two
had written they congratulated themselves
upon scoring over whittlesey and canning
this time for neither had written a word
of detailed description on cannings
board was merely the comment

    impersonation of some german recently
  prominent in public life who has been fea-
  tured in german weeklies and our own
  gazettes cannot recall the name-but
  would recognize the man anywhere

  sir reggie had written

    a perfectly astounding impersonation of
  herr schminnes german mine-owner and
  newspaper millionaire all the more remark-
  able from the difference in height-which
  must be nearly three inches but which not
  one acquaintance in fifty would have no-
  ticed

ven after reading this the other men
in the room would not believe that the
supposed german had been the earl him-
self in another fifteen minutes a tall and
sparely built man came in with the ex-
planation that he had been sent by his
lordship to examine and pass upon the de-
scriptions which had been written of the
german upon the blackboards-and pro-
ceeded to do this paying no further atten-
tion to them but making notes in a small
memorandum-book at a snap estimate
they would have placed his height at some-
where around six feet two inches-with a
weight of not over nine stone probably
nearer eight his clothing was not par-
ticularly well fitting but carefully brushed
and noticeably snug in the legs and arms
the hair was much longer than english-
men consider trim or in good taste the
black beard carelessly trimmed yet the
mans appearance was rather neat than
free lances in diplomacy

otherwise a habit of daily bathing indi-
cated and there was an expression of in-
tellectuality in the eyes which peered my-
opically through spectacles with thick
lenses the general impression was that
of a scholar a pedagogue his examina-
tion of the blackboards carried a further
one of daily habit

 when he had finished jotting down per-
centages against the list of names in his
notebook he bowed to them in a curious
foreign manner and went out this time
the men went to the blackboards instinct-
ively-writing down the closest de-
scription they could of the person who had
just left but again whittlesey and can-
ning-joined this time by another bright
young fellow-refused to consider details
the last recruit merely said

    this man-apparently russian-was show-
  ing a friend the points of interest in west-
  minster abbey yesterday afternoon face
  vaguely familiar as that of one seen occa-
  sionally about the city or in some particular
  section of it would recognize him again in
  any part of the world-day or night

 canning had written

    impersonation of a foreign professor in one
  of the universities-presumably in or near
  london as i have seen him more than once
  nationality russian or polish as i recall
  the man the impersonation is very nearly
  perfect

whittlesey was the most definite of all

    another marvelous character-study-this
  time of professor stefan tosschanoff who
  has the chair of applied chemistry london
  institute branch university of london-a
  russian from kiev while there may have
  been small details accidentally noticeable to
  one who sees the professor day by day it is
  almost certain that the impersonator would
  pass unsuspected in the mans own home-
  indefinitely

this time his lordship kept them wait-
 ing but a few minutes and came in
looking as when they had first seen him
that morning glancing carefully over
each blackboard he finally turned to them
with a courteous smile which took the
sting out of what he had to say

 gentlemen i hope this test has been
as interesting to you as it has to me it
was made this morning because govem-
mnt at this moment is desperately in need
of a few intelligence officers who possess
that something more which enables them
to run down the causes of inexplicable oc-
currences get positive evidence assume

the blue



momentous responsibility where other men
neither see nor hear anything at all two
of you possess these requirements to a most
unusual degree-and a third has cultivated
the power of observation until he may be
trusted to build upon it with intuition i
shall ask lord curzon to have them de-
tailed under my orders for the next few
weeks-on his majestys service

  whittlesey-canning-jeffries i shall
need to go over your immediate instruc-
tions at once if you are disengaged will
you accompany me in my car to park lane
after i have shown his excellency these
boards and attended to the formalities

the three foreign office men lunched

	with the earl and countess at their
famous jacobean mansion with consider-
able inward gratification-after which vis-
count lammerford arrived with one of the
best-known cabinet ministers and the
party adjourned to the big library for
coffee and cigars it was however a most
serious conference upon a matter of state
the earl wasted no time in idle pleasantries
briefly running over the events of the
previous afternoon and evening he turned
to captain whittlesey with a question

  sir reginald you recognized in my
make-up this morning an impersonation of
professor stefan tesschanoff of the uni-
versity how did you happen to know him
so well any evidence against him

  id not go so far as that sir-ive seen
him lecturing at the university in south
kensington once or twice more recently
ive seen him at restaurants with two men
whom i knew in paris to be russian
bolshevists

  have you shadowed him or his house
under orders from downing street

  no sir they took a fancy to my sys-
tem of filing at the f o-and my duties
there have been entirely clerical since i
came home

  the earl made a gesture of impatient
disgust we shall have to overhaul the
foreign office methods of examination
makin a clerk out of a first-chop intelli-
gence officer tryin to use a lot of wooden
men in that capacity of course they hit
it right occasionally-but its law of aver-
age rather than intelligent selection jef-
fries you said in your description that
you had seen a man resembling my make-
up in westminster abbey yesterday after-
noon-and that youd recognize him again
anywhere seen such a man before
book magazine

  yes sir-coming out of a mayfair house
which sets back from the street a bit in its
own grounds and your make-up was
something more than a resemblance sir
for a second or two id have sworn you
were the man i saw yesterday in the ab-
bey

  very good our little demonstration in
observin things this morning appears to
have rooted out some most amazin evi-
dence-far more than i even hoped to ob-
tain for several days at least let me
connect three bits of it an see how it
strikes you all first-leftenant jeffries
is positive about seein my double yester-
day afternoon in westminster abbey cap-
tain whittlesey swears i was impersonatin
professor tesschanoff-a russian orig-
inally from kiev but resident in london
for many years both of these gentlemen
say id have deceived intimate friends of
the other man last night-when begin-
ning to come out of the ether after his
frightful operation an not responsible for
what he said according to sir pelham cur-
ran-sir templeton bramville told us he
was shot by a man in an upper window of
westminster abbey with a rifle which had
a silencer on its muzzle and in the few
words he gasped out during intervals of
less pain he described tesschanoffs face
exactly

  might not the description apply to
other men equally well

  if they had unkempt black beards
wore spectacles were of unmistakable rus-
sian type yet personally neat as to clothes
and linen-yes but how many men an-
swering that description were in the vi-
cinity of westminster abbey yesterday
afternoon we happen to know that tess-
chanoff himself was there at just about
that time or a little before men have
been hanged upon less circumstantial evi-
dence than thisl

  however-let me add more when the
polish an roumanian envoys made their
secret visit to london we naturally ex-
pected attempts upon their lives from rus-
sian agents tesschanoff another pro-
fessor and two women artists in st johns
wood were known to have received at their
houses a number of russians and presuma-
ble germans who were subsequently de-
ported as undesirable aliens but there
was no evidence of any sort against those
four their records for the past ten or fif-
teen years were absolutely straight and re-
spectable of course they had a perfect

by clarence herbert new



right to receive acquaintances from among
their fellow-countrymen if ignorant of their
dangerous activities

  well-i had no real belief in their
ignorance or innocence in the past ten
years ive picked up hundreds of secret
recognition-signs an passwords used by
the old wilhelmstrasse the bolshevists the
i w w and various political organiza-
tions in diffrent countries-enough of
them to take an occasional chance of
passin as a member of such organizations
as a fellow russian professor who had been
working in the united states an was
going back to moscow by way of london
i gained a good deal of tesschanoffs con-
fidence-but not all of it-until i pur-
posely had him jailed on an enemy charge
an worked a lot of mysterious influence
to set him free next morning since then
he volunteers for my benefit any bit of in-
formation which may turn up considers
me a tried an proved bolshevist like him-
self

  then-youve actual proof that he is
one

trevor nodded absolute proof that
 he is the chief soviet representative in
england that his house is used as a ren-
dezvous for the more recent arrivals and
that while all plans and orders originate
in moscow his suggestions carry a good
deal of weight and many of the executive
details are worked out in his house

  then-why in the name of wonder isnt
he in the tower and his house occupied by
agents of the government

  because that would destroy our best
clue to red activities here those four
have no suspicion that they are watched
they fancy their former records completely
protect them as stool-pigeons theyre of
immense value to govemmnt-both eng-
lish an french

  yet by using them as such and not in-
terfering with their activities you permit
a government leader to be shot upon the
street in broad daylight you permit
members of parliament to be intimidated
by anonymous letters until our entire sys-
tem of government is in a way of being
overturned

  ill wager your excellency that it will
be practically impossible to connect by
direct evidence professor tesschanoff or
either of the other three with the shooting
of bramville or the sending of those letters
which may have been written in some east
free lances in diplomacy

end lodging-house at the other side of lon-
don-unless we make them convict them-
selves by word of mouth and this is
where i expect these bright chaps from
downing street to help me here whit-
tlesey are data giving the location of every
burglar-alarm contact in tesschanoffs
house-a cleverly worked-out system of
them i assure you connected with a little
buzzer and dial on his desk also in his
sleeping-room i wish you and canning
to gain access to the house at night-scot-
land yard will be warned not to see you
install a dictaphone in tesschanoffs
library-wires leading to adjoining house
on the left which ive managed to have
vacant just now youll relieve each
other at that dictaphone in two-hour tricks
day an night i also wish photographic
descriptions of every person the professor
talks with-in his house or elsewhere
jeffries will make up as a russian-he
speaks the language well enough to pass
among them-an take lodgings in a certain
pub down near the albert dock reporting
to me every russian austrian scandina-
vian or german who comes there and with
whom they spend their time

a detailed account of the earls
trap and how it was sprung would
make a story by itself space in this one
permits but a brief touching upon the main
points impersonating the supposed rus-
sian professor wladowitch trevor unex-
pectedly turned up at tesschanoffs house
after a complete disappearance of several
weeks and more by implication than direct
statements led the professor to infer what
his recent activities had been casually
during the conversation he referred to the
shooting of sir templeton bramville as a
perfectly understood action cautioning
tesschanoff that he had been seen in the
abbey by some one who almost guessed his
identity some intuition of that marvelous
sort which made trevor the genius he was
led him to mention the anonymous letter to
members of parliament as likely to work
out in a very satisfactory way for herr
schminnes of the german reichstag and
tesschanoff carelessly admitted that they
were doing all that schminnes had hoped
from them trevor-as wladowitch-then
hinted that it was about time for schminnes
to visit england and the professor said
that he looked for him during the follow-
ing week following adjournment of the spa
conference at which he had been present

the blue



a subsequent transcript of what came over
the dictaphone-wires to a room in the ad-
joining house would have hanged tesscha-
noff unquestionably had he not been much
more valuable alive to the intelligence
department and for the next ten days
every port was under surveillance of for-
eign office men looking for a middle-class
german of slovenly disreputable appear-
ance who was none the less a billionaire
and the greatest commercial force that ger-
many had yet produced

r ventually a man answering this
 description landed at queensboro from
a flushing boat and went to a second-rate
hotel patronized by aliens not far from st
pauls for a week his business appeared
to be almost entirely with bankers stock-
brokers shipping-agents and the like-en-
tirely legitimate and unobjectionable on the
face of it tesschanoff lunched with him
twice at a restaurant in holbom where
they occupied a private dining-room with
another russian and a swede but when
the door was opened unexpectedly by a
strange waiter they were absorbedly play-
ing pinochle and smoking pipes with porce-
lain bowls schminnes did not once go
near the professors house-or-apparently
--have interviews with any of the bolshe-
vists then in london at the end of the
week however the earl decided that he
had enough evidence to order the mans
arrest and detention upon a charge of con-
spiracy against the british government
he was taken after leaving his hotel one
evening and conveyed to the tower-
where he laughed in the chief wardens
face

  look you herr offizier some one of
der british schwell-maype de bolice-
maype a duke-haf orderdt my arrest
for why i know nodt-undt i dond gif

book magazine

  the warden had been told who his pris-
oner was his telephone-bells had rung in-
cessantly-some of the most influential
bankers in london protesting against the
arrest of schminnes as an official blunder
upon some ones part after some little
thought he called up the earls park lane
mansion and repeated verbatim what the
german had said dining with the earl at
that moment there happened to be the
foreign secretary-the lord president of
the council-another cabinet minister and
two influential members of parliament
answering trevors question as he turned
from the phone they all agreed upon the
advisability of having the man brought
there for a private examination which by
reason of their official positions would
amount practically to a government court
with full powers in twenty minutes herr
schminnes was brought into the big library
by an officer of the tower guard-and
without a trace of uneasiness or embarrass-
ment seated himself in their circle turn-
ing to earl trevor who as master of the
house he intuitively felt to be the person
responsible for his arrest the german
looked him over calmly from head to foot
then-

  you are te person who haf me arrest-
ed me-johann schminnes well-
broceed for why-if you blease tre-
vors voice sometimes conveyed the sensa-
tion of icicles trickling down ones back-
when absolutely sure of his facts and feel-
ing the necessity for being merciless

  schminnes-commercially you are said
to be the biggest man in germany you
own mines steamships newspapers and va-
rious other industries just now you were
delegate to a conference of world-wide im-
portance and were said to control your
confreres absolutely one wculd suppose
that you were fully occupied with your
affairs at home yet you come to london
-conspire with bolshevists and anarchists
--cause anonymous letters to be sent to
members of parliament terrorizing them
with threats of assassination if they do not
vote for policies which would completely
overturn the british government-and are
deliberately buying up through dummy
syndicates some of the most valuable prop-
erties in england all of which according
to british law comes under the head-in
time of peace-of conspiracy against his
majestys government and is punishable
by a long term of imprisonment at hard
labor

cor perhaps two full minutes there was
 dead silence in the room neither the
cabinet ministers nor the others had
missed the force of the germans remarks
imprisoning such a man as a remedy for
the international situation was too farcical
to consider presently the earl touched a
push-button on the edge of the big table-
summoning his tall afghan khansamah

  sabub  show this man out
and-er-sabub when he is on the
porch outside you may kick him-once
i fancy youll enjoy that it will be also
an expression of british opinion in a
way

  when the two had disappeared there
was another silence-during which the
cabinet ministers were absorbed in reflec-
tion upon some of the things which had
been said after a while trevor spoke-
with his famous inimitable drawl

  rather severe arraignment-what an
some points were so near actual fact that
they should be branded into the skull of
every englishman the world over we are
trifling an workin to little purpose while
the house bums never a doubt of it
were afraid of doin the tlhprecedented
thing we lack the daring to impose effi-
ciency-system-constructive planning-
upon the country by force regardless of la-
bor an socialistic howling but were going
to wake up gentlemen-and the process
will start tomorrow morning when prac-
tically every briton will read in his morn-
ing paper what schminnes and the bolshe-
vists did to our members of parliament an
what that middle-class bounder just told
us to our faces lets see if were as rot-
ten as he claims i rather fancy-not

henry gannon had no idea
that five minutes would deter-
mine for him an interesting prob-
lem and yet the briefest review
of his family fortunes might have prepared
his mind for swift alterations gannon
grandfather in cotton overalls had sown
wheat for his life in pennsylvania clay
gannon father in a silk shirt walked for
mere pride among his alabama cotton-
bolls gannon henry clifford in his khaki
clothes was shooting wild animals for
pleasure on the uplands of east africa

  henry stood motionless with rifle ready
to raise in both hands his helmeted head
slightly bent forward staring over the tall
yellow grass into a fringe of green trees
that marked a thirsty river-bank a
waterbuck was in those trees thirty rods
away and he wanted to learn just where
five paces behind him and also statesque
mustafa the black gunbearer was searching
with skilled eyes for the same antelope
and neither man knew of a fourth fateful
presence

  one yard to the right of henry gannon
lay hidden in the grass the stubby tail of
a puff-adder away from him extended
the flabby breadth of its body and the for-
ward half of it drawn like the letter s had
a yellow-and-black heart-shaped head
buff and brown chevrons on its back were
partly powdered with dust a very slug-
gish snake the puff-adder not given to
book magazine

the puff-adder

 p-adder

pursuing an enemy not accustomed to
avoiding unpleasantness sane beasts and
men gave it room otherwise a sidewise
flash of its ugly head removed the annoy-
ance promptly-a man for instance in
half an hour the deadliest reptile of east
africa was flattened and still with staring
eyes and looked like a strip of old carpet
charged with malevolent infections

   but since this thing was hidden henry
could not know that the next few minutes
were to decide whether he remained a man
or became something less

  for the present he was a tall slender
youth with the pride of wealth in his dark
eyes and a conscious self-esteem in the cul-
ture of his neat mustache even here on
the broad plains under the equator he did
himself well as though ready to meet in-
spection of the sophisticated each morn -
ing he shaved and every night took the
warm bath which custom decreed in the
land under the hive-shaped cork helmet his
wavy black hair lay cleanly parted down
the middle by a white rift the nails of
his long fingers showed scrupulous care
the girls of languorous mobile by the
gulf of mexico had regarded henry gan-
non with watchful expectation and threw
about him a soft air of respect which he
did not forget in the wild ends of the earth
they thought him very good-looking he
had a clear skin straight nose firm chin
and lips that were suitable



  these lips he was now pressing together
in concentrated attention he had seen
the waterbuck go leisurely out of the open
fields into the band of trees when the
mounting sun beat too hotly on its shaggy
brown coat and after infinite caution he
had come to this point of his stalk two
minutes ago the following black man hissed
a warning to stand still now they would
hold their positions like immovable plants
till the timid eyes of the quarry turned
once more away henry however did not
make out where the waterbuck stood and
was annoyed

  another than him this might not have
bothered but gannon was sensitive to
gross racial influences he was com-
pounded of northern ancestry and south-
ern surroundings and the instinct of su-
periority was strong in him since his
family was not of the traditional old south
henry tried in vain to shake off a certain
self-consciousness in dealing with the ne-
groes he could not flow gently into the
world where black and white mingled as
separate atoms of life everywhere and yet
kept apart by impalpable films of under-
standing the inherited ease of relation-
ship between whites and blacks prescrib-
ing subtly where contact began and fin-
ished was not exquisite in him-probably
because of its even more rudimentary exist-
ence in his own father the vigorous suc-
cessful planter and the consequent home
environment so henry maintained the
correct attitude of his social place with
elaborate care he was willing to have the
dark men serve him provided that the bor-
der of familiarity was never crossed and of
course he could never do a menial act for
one of them always he was the gentleman
among his equals and the considerate mas-
ter of his subordinates

  outwardly it should be said for oc-
casional trials of spirit were bound to oc-
cur this one for example mustafa was
an excellent gunbearer whose chief duty
was to carry the big double-barreled rifle
and give it to the master at a critical mo-
ment he had spare cartridges for both
guns in his pocket the water-can and cup
and the lunch in a bag his ragged felt
hat covered a big woolly head as henry
well knew without looking around and be-
yond doubt the whites of his eyes were now
visible in the excitement of his quest for
the game before them hes as sharp as i
am growled gannon recalling many a
scene of their tramps together often mus-
the puff-adder

tafa had pointed for minutes at the mo-
tionless form of an animal before his em-
ployer could see it behind a bit of brush
now and then he told him how to approach
and get a close shot sometimes he re-
strained him from a false step which would
spoil the stalk and once worst of all he
had shown impatience when the white man
missed an easy chance at a kudu it was
a gradual succession of small rubbings that
chafed mustafa was one of the best na-
tive hunters and it galled henry gannon
to admit that in even one particular the
black was his better mustafa at his back
directing the master what to do and not to
do was an irritant

  im a fool he said to himself to get
mad at mustafa seein how i hired him
almost guaranteed to show me the fine
points of huntin he tried to dwell on
the mans good qualities which were
many what else than appreciation had
caused him to give mustafa his own pair
of ten-inch boots they were too heavy
for comfortable walking and henry pre-
ferred the ankle-high shoes which he had
on but a glimpse of the gunbearers
worn-out sandals had made his master fear
that he might pick up a thorn or even be
bitten by a snake and so he had given him
these good ones mustafa was delighted
and wore them all the time snakes might
be anywhere henry thought thats a
chance you run and you sure cant be al-
ways watchin for them he had on
spiral puttees i wonder if theyd stop a
snake-bite he had occasionally mused
pressing his left arm to the side pocket he
felt the small bottle of permanganate crys-
tals and reassured himself no remedy is
certain but this gives a spare chance

ljaving thus in parade the momentary

	pageant of his mind henry gannon
stood almost within the precinct of fate
for the puff-adder lay motionless and in-
visible to him under a veil of dust and
grass the back of its head contained
acidulous stuff in a font from which tubes
ran to the base of two hollow folding fangs
at the forward corners of its upper jaw
when the mouth opened wide the fangs
stood nearly inch-long on their bases near
to the point of each curved weapon a-small
hole marked the poison-vent the snake
was ready to dart its head like an open
hand at an enemy and pierce him with the
fangs a slight muscular contraction back
of its eyes would leave sufficient venom

the blue



deep below the surface of the body the
circulation of the victims blood would do
the rest that was the puff-adders method
and for many thousands of years it had
been entirely satisfactory small wonder
that the viper lay quiet and contented in
the grass at the instant of striking it
would probably make a hiss of anger but
then the warning would not matter

  no intimation however came at this
moment to henry gannon the thought
of a possible accident went through and
out of his mind and he studied how to
shoot the waterbuck which should be in
the greenery of the river bank that was
his business here if he had arrived with-
out stepping on a snake here he was
there were too many surprises on the
african plateau for a man to worry about
the next that might happen you could
always be sure of surprises a few months
had taught him at least that now the
thing was the waterbuck

  a triflin bit farther to the right and i
ought to see him henry said to himself
and began to put his foot in that direction

  hsss came strongly to his ears from
mustafa and whispered word dont
move master he will see you

  henry checked his step but to be re-
minded by his servant that immobility was
the price of winning the antelope annoyed
him wasnt it his affair if he frightened
the waterbuck and wasnt mustafa the
paid gunbearer his jobs to hand me
the big gun when i want it sure nough
that the black man behind him should
direct his moving or standing was intoler-
able it upset all his acquired ideas of the
proper relation between the two races id
show the fellow if i had him at home
henry thought hed see where he was
right nough yet he had to acknowledge
that years of practice in seeing and stalk-
ing the animals gave mustafa authority
well its only in the actual work of
huntin that he can talk to me passin
that he takes my orders and not i his
ignoring now the directions of his at-
tendant he judged it good to shift his
stand a trifle in the hope of catching a
clear sight of the waterbuck which baffled
them he distinguished one large tree that
prevented a view into part of the grove
and thought if he moved sufficiently to
bring the trunk aside he might make out
the antelope

  im goin to walk slowly this side he
said for the gunbearer to hear
book magazine

  wait master replied mustafa hoarse-
ly i see him the man quivered with
excitement wait he said again i
come up behind you stooping behind
henry as a screen keeping his eyes fixed
straight ahead he came close and with a
careful hand pointed over the white mans
shoulder and past his face see that
flower the color of blood one yard above
is his left horni

  yes i see said henry gannon bring-
ing up the rifle slowly gimme room

vustafa stepped to the right the
 sound of a whistling breath in the
grass two taps in rapid succession
mustafa gave a frightful scream and
sprang high in the air he knew what it
was he began to jump at the first tap
but the second struck before he jumped
one on the heel and the other on the ankle
of his leather boot he was jumping when
the third caught him higher on the calf of
the leg between the time that his foot-
nerve signaled to his brain something is
striking at me and the time that his brain
telegraphed back to his foot muscles the
order jump the thing struck him a
second and third time so quick as that
was it the third made no tap because
it landed on the soft woollen puttees and
the fangs of the open mouth sank deep in
the flesh the snake dangled from his leg
and then fell

  mustafa raging shot both barrels of the
elephant-gun into the mottled strip of old
turkish rug that henry saw at his feet and
blew it to pieces he dashed away a few
yards sat down where the grass was thin
and tore off the spiral band which covered
his leg henry ran and helped

  into his mind as he ran after mustafa
leaped the words ligature cutting suc-
tion antiseptic then a racing lot of old
advice came back to him stop the blood
from carrying the poison through the body
gash the bite to the bottom get most of the
poison out and put in permanganate of
potassium to neutralize the rest of the
venom these simple directions he had
learned as part of his elementary educa-
tion when he came out to africa and
they told him that it was a matter of min-
utes if not of seconds in saving a mans
life from a puff-adder you can rub in
the crystals and then suck the stuff out if
you want to they said and the quicker
you do both the better after that youve
got to wash the wound constantly with a

by marshall scull



solution of the permanganate and if you
were slow at first youll have to keep him
alive with stimulants and jv ly well nurse
him for a couple of weeks

mot pausing to look at the bite mustafa
a  passed the thin tape-end of the puttee
several times loosely about his leg below
the knee and thrust the gun-barrel through
the stuff and twisted it round and round
till he squeezed the tape into his brown
skin

  medicine master he panted henry
had the bottle ready in his hand he put a
pinch of the purple-black crystals into the
drinking-cup that he took from the mans
belt and poured on them water from the
canteen

  mustaft whipped out his skinning knife
he doubled his right leg up so that he could
see the two little holes and slashed them
savagely he cut across the two holes an
inch deep and criss-crossed the cuts with-
out wincing fluid began to come but it
was weak watery blood mustafa squeezed
the place hard with both hands working in
a frenzy of haste he knew that his life
was a question of minutes medicine
master he said again

  henry sifted more pulverized crystals
out of the bottle into his palm and put
them into the wound with his fingers and
rubbed till they disappeared their ten-
dency was to make the venom insoluble
and neutralize its power but still it re-
mained beneath the surface of mustafas
flesh still it was trying to spread through
the blood vessels and lymph glands and
destroy them

  most if not all of the injection henry
knew that he must get out of the system
at once or the man would die he picked
the cup from the ground aimlessly and
shook it till all was a purple liquid within
he himself felt sickish he set the cup
down again

  mustafa was trying to bend and reach
the leg with his mouth the bite was on
the outer side of his calf and he could not
get to it he pulled desperately upward
on the foot and bent his head down but
there was a wide gap that he could not
span master he cried push down my
head henry placed his hands on the
mans shoulders and tried to force his body
into a shape that nature would not let it
take he put his whole weight on the neck
and yet the head would not reach the spot
mustafas lips protruded eagerly to find
the puff-adder

and suck out of his leg the deadly venom
but they could not

  minutes were ticking away presently
the black mans leg would swell and he
would get dizzy while the venom was cor-
rupting his tissues his heart would jump
a beat now and then the skin would get
clammy his eyes would dilate and he
would be sick after a while he would die

jjenry thought of all this the only
hope clutched insistently at his throat
there was only one thing that anybody
could do and he must do it because mus-
tafa could not it was precisely the one
thing that he could not imagine himself
doing for anyone who had a black skin it
was to apply his own lips to the nasty
wound in mustafas leg and suck out the
poison his soul revolted at the thought
that was the one impossible act for henry
gannon to do if he had been the son ctf
an old southern family in whom tender-
ness and affection for the negroes were tra-
ditions perhaps he might have been will-
ing to perform this abasement but he was
of northern stock and really southern only
in one generation

  nor did mustafa ask him not once did
the native apparently suppose that his
master would lower himself to save the life
which was so cheap compared with his
daintiness mustafa sought his help only
to break his head down so that he could
reach the place with his own lips when
that failed he fell to squeezing and knead-
ing the leg and the white man watched
futilely

  henry gannon understood in a general
way that the venom of vipers took effect
only through the blood messengers of
science ran to his mind telling him again
what he knew venom was not usually
absorbed into the system through the mu-
cous membrane of the mouth

  well he reasoned if a fella washed
out his mouth with the permanganate solu-
tion it would be some sorta safeguard
his sense of duty was driving his instinct
and selfishness till they cringed if the
chemical beats the poison in the flesh it
oughta do the same in the mouth he
must spit out draught upon draught till the
clean red blood came at the very idea he
spat he felt that if he did this thing and
lived he would be spitting out of his
mouth till the end of time besides the
blood and the poison would remain a taste
which he could never spit out

by marshall scull



  mustafa groaned despairingly henry
looked at him and asked feel bad

  it hurts master i am going to die
poison was wasted on your boot how
much coulda got inte your leg

  oh master it is strong mustafa
cried two drop and a man is dead if
i could only get my mouth there 

  gannon looked this way and that into
the immense loneliness sfive miles from
camp not a living witness of the acci-
dent he could not be blamed if this man
was bitten by a puff-adder whatever he
did or whatever risk he took in trying to
save him might be in vain the hyenas
could readily have two bodies to rend in-
stead of one when night shrouded their
ghastly procedure

  for the humble african waited possibly
an unknown and indifferent mother or girl
accustomed to mens precarious hold of life
and she would not unduly bewail an ever-
expected loss

  for henry gannon on the other side of
the world were exuberant uses sweet
mouths of women delicate food soft
words memorable stories

  memorable stories if he now saved his
lips for such pastime there would be one
deed to which they would not eagerly give
sound always there would be in memory
this irresolute refusal of a bitter cup a
tossed and scattered whiteness of bones
would forever remind him of one inaction
forgotten on the breast of a dark continent
secret from all men but himself which
would make false and rotten every pretense
that his pure lips could utter

  to withhold from a man white or black
looking with brave eyes into the face of
death any part of the help that he might
be able to give him was to become con-
temptible in his own sight he henry
clifford gannon the fine gentleman would
not even remain a man he would become
something less

  sweat broke out on his face and for an
instant the world made a half-tum before
his dimmed eyes one end of the horizon
tilted up and the other end down then
he found himself and flung away fear and
vanity and shouted god help me ill
do what i can

  he dropped his head and took mustafas
black leg a radiant thankfulness on the
gunbearers face brightened and shamed
out the old inhumanity and poured into
henry a newomanhood he shut his eyes
and gave his nice lips to the vile service

mechanic attached to sol mach-
ins garage and repair shop over
on the avenue he wears greasy
overalls and is smeared to his grizzled eye-
brows with oil and grime but is a man
of substance and his word is authority at
sol machins

  years ago tim and i got our pay-enve-
lopes every other tuesday from the same
cashier because of the memory of those
years tim comes over and fixes my little
motorcar on off-days and after hours that
i may not be at the mercy of that thief
of the world mintioning no names and
what he dont know wont hurt him

  is there much the matter with her
i asked tim one evening

  i cant tell yit-as he lifted the hood
for one thing youve got a cracked porce-
lain and the plugs are all dirty you
cuddnt start her y say he went
around and dug under the seat small
wonder youve corrosion enough on your
battery to frost a christmas cake and
shes choked wit carbon-dont she knock
somethin fierce goin up hill

  i dont remember we havent been
going up hill last sunday we drove out
to gary

  wit th strikes and the uprising and
everything garys a great place observed

wid the trees thick on each side my but

theyre dark at nightl was ye iver on

  no i answered

  tim smiled reminiscently i was wance
near arristed out there just before the
ind of the war i was on some adventure
that night

  for speeding tim

  no indeed for bein drunk and dis-
orderly havin no lights on and on sus-
picion of bein a german spy youve
heard of mike odoyle maybe he was
wance a big gun in pollytics on the west
side hes gettin old now but hes niver
got over his free-handed way of giving and
taking and in consequince theres been
more than wance his frinds have had to
keep him from bein set in the street
such things is wearin on ffindship y
know poor mike to think what pollytics
has brought him to and he used to be
treatin his frinds to champagne in kegs

  he married nora carney who he met
at a grand ball given by the fourth ward
democratic club and shes second cousin
to me on me mothers side thats how
i happened to be mixed up in this affair

 twas near nine oclock in the evenin 
pursued tim when nora odoyle
called me up she was in a terrible stew
and i finally managed to make out that
mike had been took bad inside of him and
wud die before mornin unless he was took

 
a wild night in gary

right to the hospital for an operation and
that the doctor wuddnt perform the opera-
tion nor indeed wud they let him into the
hospital widout cash payment down
which sounds cruel ill say but at that
mikes pretty well known

  well i wondered did she think i had
-siveral hundred dollars on me and i was
explainin that wid the best intintions in
the world i cuddnt get into the bank
before morning but it seemed that wasnt
what she was after wud i come wid a
car as quick as god would let me and take
her out to gary

   gary woman said i  this time of
night are ye mad

  and she wint on like shed lost her
mind pleadin for the love of the virgin
not to stop to ask questions but to beg
or steal a car and come and get her and
father kelly wud stay wid mike till we
got back for there wasnt a soul in the
neighborhood that shed ask a favor of
wid their hearts of fiends and that if she
cuddnt get to gary and back by midnight
mike would die

  sure she had me so excited that i
didnt know what i was about meself sol
had gone home and there wasnt a thing
loose in the garage exceptin a  five-
passenger flivver that young sidney
machin does be using to deliver fresh
country eggs and butter straight from
south water street to a selected list of
patrons the cap of the radiator was lost
off and it was plugged up wid a cork tied
up in a rag like youd stopper a vinegar
jug a rear fender was danglin broken
and ivry bolt in her rattled but i stopped
for nothin but to stick a measurin rod in
the gasoline tank and i was off

   i took side streets and wint like blazes
and nora was ready waitin for me on the
steps she did a flyin leap up beside me
that wud have done credit to a college
athalete and away we wint wid the broken
fender rattlin and some tunes a-playin in-
side that i didnt like the sound of but
had no time to stop and investigate the
wind whistled past our ears and she yelled
at me between blasts explainin things
we wasnt bound for gary exactly but
for the liberty powdher works which as
you know are situated about a mile be-
yond though theyre not runnin now a
man named con mcgillicuddy worked
there and it seemed he was under etarnal
obligations to mike for some past favor-
somethin that happened when mike was in

the blue



pollytics-i think twas bein released from
the penitentiary or some little thing like
that this mcgillicuddy was makin big
wages and always carried his money on
him he wud be havin a thousand or two
in his clothes and cud slip mike five hun-
dred as aisy as youd blow the foam from
a glass of beer-in the good days thats
past and gone and all day long she had
been tryin to reach him by long-distance
tiliphone but niver an answer or a word of
satisfaction was she able to get and then
what the doctor had said again-and all
the rest of it

ell we was clippin along a road
as black as the inside of a tunnel
but nearin the place for on up ahead was
a big high light a -burnin whin above our
own rattlin i hear the roar of a motor-
cycle exhaust and then a sput-sput tearin
along and somebody yells halt

  i kep right on figurin we was decent
law-bidin people and twas not us was
mint

  then the machine blazed up alongside
of us and a little man on it in a rubber coat
yells why dont ye halt whin youre or-
dered by the law halt i say

  wid that i saw his officers star and i
slowed down were in a tearin hurry
i said what is it please i was not
lookin for trouble so i resisted the timp-
tation to pull the little scut off his machine
and baste him one

  he was a little red-faced turk swelled
fit to bust wid his own importance and in-
dignation do you know what road this
is says he ixplain your prisince here

   we was under the impression it led
to the powdher works and as thats our

and at that up comes a couple of young
soldier-boys wid guns on their shoulders

frind at the powdher-works says the offi-
cer turnin to thim he has his nerve
right wid him but has left his pass at

  id a mind to tell him he was no venus
himself but held still for the sake of nora
who was beginnin to get hysteriky

   oh please let us see this man mr
officer she cries its a matter of life-
and death

  just then back of us there rolls up a
big limousine whats the trouble asks
a womans voice and i see she was alone
and drivin

  the soldier-boys waited while the po-
liceman addressed her and in a minute i
made out from the conversation that she
was the superintendents wife come to
bring him a late lunch or the like i
nudged nora do you go over and talk
with her i whispered

- nora climbed down and in about three
minutes i knew by the way they had their
heads together ivrything was all right
prisintly the woman said ill take this
lady to the timekeeper and be responsible
for her boys i promise you ill stay
right by

  the soldiers and the little cop whis-
pered together and then they saluted again
and said if ye say so mrs gordon and
the little cop gives a contemptuous snort
and sput-sputs away in the dark the su-
perintendents wife drives down the road
slow wid nora and i sat waitin

  but i thought you said you were ar-
rested i complained

  tim grinned have patience miss
fanny remimber the night was young

y and by nora comes trudgin back a
sintry on each side of her she was in
a terrible state hes not there she said

omadahaun of a timekeeper cuddnt give

tin mad all this hullaballoo about leavin

  i made allowances for her state of mind
and said nothing prisintly we were off
and i noticed a new note in the tunes the
flivver was playin and i saw that she
was runnin on three cylinders but thinks
i well fetch gary annyhow and after
siveral false moves we locate the gates
hotel which was a bohunk boardin-house

  there was oilcloth on the floor and a
dozen or fifteen speckled spittoons ranged
in rows along the sides the air was blue
wid tobacco-smoke and a phonnygraf in
one comer wid the muffler off was screech-
in out pretty baby and loungin about
was a dozen or so hunkeys pickin their
teeth and holdin fast to their dinner-pails
waitin to go on shift at the mills or the
powdher works and others was cornin in
twas a real classy boardin-house

  the proprietors wife came out to see
what we wanted she had a face like a
plate and was built like a movin-van we
asked her was there a man stoppin there
by the name of murphy she said ya-h-h
but he is to bedt and she wasnt a woman
youd start an argymint wid i had a
hunch and slipped her a dollar i found in
me clothes and then she said she wud call

tacles ridin his nose lopsided and lookin

  his eyes bulged out and he began to
look mad i havent the pleasure of the
gintlemans acquaintance said he and i
dont know what youre talkin about and
id like to know what license you have to
rout a man out-

   oh plase excuse us sir broke in
nora and then she started to explain and
the little chap got over his peeve and be-
gun to look interested thats a sad state
of affairs says he and im sorry im not
the chap thats wanted im from the
east says he and i was sint here to take
subscriptions for the gentlewomans guide
a wild night in gary

and im frank to say this is not a fruitful
field for that kind of work to put it
stronger its an absolute desert and so ive
been reduced to this in the interim of wait-
in for ixpinse money to be tiligraphed
to me

  well i was sorry for his troubles but
had plinty of me own and nora was gettin
hysteriky again so i started to bid him
good-by but he stopped me wid

   wait maybe i can be of assistance
will some of yez shut off that devils con-
traption in the corner he yells speaking
to the hunkeys and meanin the phonny-
graf there thats better a man can
hear himself think now does anny of ye
know a man named mcgillicuddy at the
powdher works he says did ye say he
was in the acid room-to me

  not a hunkey moved well thin do
anny of y know a man named murphy
or was there a man used to board here by
that name-turnin to the proprietors
wife who had just lumbered in again

  then a hunkey had a brainstorm and
rose to his feet excited me know red
morphee big man he room by cosy
rest

   yah-h says the lady movin-van
waggin her head violent red morphee
he get boss job at powd works he no
good

   write it down tim says nora

  then another hunkey got agitated
joe morphee me know he live by
pasinskys house other side of powd
works

   write it down says nora

  just then in comes a scrap of a messen-
ger-boy-that shud have been wrapped in
the innocent dreams of a child at that hour
-but he switches his cigarette around and
calls out wire for mr murphy

  the little man grabs the tiligram and
reads it over twice careful then he
straightens up wid a grunt and says me
moneys at the office waitin for me at last
thank heaven now this red murphy
might he not be your man tell us all
you know about him-to the proprietors
wife

   twas little enough she cud tell but
the little man nods like hes satisfied and
folds up the tiligram and puts it careful in
his pocket all this time-nora was twitch-
in me coat wid impatience and i made to
start again but the little man ducks for the
stairs and cries wait wait till i get me
coat and ill go along ill welcome divar-

the blue



   sion for the rest of the night and if youll
think what its mint to be stuck in this
gehenna for three weeks youll not deny
me it

   you can come and welcome says
nora ony theres no time to spare and
for the love of mary crank up and be
movin tim oh me poor poor mike
what will you think im doin all this
while

e hurrooshed around to the cosy
rest and twas like the gates hotel
as much as two peas in a pod ony a little
more so wid a bunch settin around that
looked like theyd just broke jail the
proprietor was a broken-nosed uffsky tha
gargled his words like he had a fishbone in
his throat faith i was glad i had the
little man murphy wid me for i did not
fancy the look of the place at all

  but we found our man and it was lucky
hed just come in and was not in bed for
id hate to be the one that disturbed his
beauty sleep-take it from me he was
six foot high and had red hair and a prize-
fighters reach and he had a beautiful
brogue-not like mine but continuous and
logical the very spit of a tarrier just over
ony his eyes were mean and little but
he was no nixt of kin to con mcgillicuddy
though he said the name had a grand ring
to it and hed a been proud to oblige us

   why rot invite him to come along wid
us says the little murphy man aside to
me for the nights are long and tis an
awful thing whin grown men are reduced to
ice-cream sodys and piksher shows for di-
varsion and besides hed be a good one
to have wid us in case of trouble which we
may run up against

  so i asked the big man wud he like to
join us as there was room in the car and
the night was young and the little man
chipped in a word or two and he had a
way wid him that was very persuasive
and the moon had come up and the stars
were out and the cool of the night was
timpting alongside of the place we were in
where you cud have shoveled out the air
in chunks sothe big man says he will be
glad to go along for an hour or two but
must get back in time to get his sleep for
he goes on shift in the morning and
he gave us the names of a couple more
murphys which he recalled and i wrote
thim down

  now youll wonder why i did such a
fool thing as to take these people along
 book magazine



  wid me whin i was on a life-and-death mat-
ter as you might say but there was some-
thin about the little man that hypnotized
me and i thought the both of thim
knowin gary so much better than we did
we might need their hilp and the little
man was as cheerful as if he was goin to
a party and he tells nora to keep good
heart and well find the murphy thats nixt
of kin if we have to roust out ivry bohunk
between the steel-mills and the powdher
works and he says not to take the doc-
tors decision as final as often theyre
wrong and he cud tell her of a case he
knew where a man was given two hours to
live and that night he was able to sit up
to liver and onions and was now workin
in a coal-yard and he jollied her along
until pretty soon she was all cheered up

  then he turned his attintion to the red
murphy and got chummy wid him tellin
him of the turrible time hed been havin
tryin to sell the gentlewomans guide in
gary and relatin some of his experiences
which was fit to split your sides and the
red murphy grew more cheerful too and
prisiritly i heard the little man sympa-
thizin wid him on the terrible calamity
that had come upon the state wid the last
election and droppin his voice to a whis-
per and i strained me ears and twas not
long before i heard a mite of a gurgle and
almost at wance the red man got very
cheerful indeed

  me scalp began to prickle and cold
chills run down me back as i thought to
meself theyve a bottle uncorked be-
tween thim and god knows what will come
now heaven forgive me what have i
let meself and this poor innocent woman in
for but we was bangin along makin
a noise like an army truck loaded wid tin-
ware and whin i took heed of the sounds
of distriss cornin from under the hood i
knew twas beyond reason that we cud run
much longer and there wud not be time for
thim to get very drunk before we had to
stop for good

e were all this time callin on mur-
phys of which we had gathered a
list half as long as your arm for each
place we stopped we learned of one or two
more and was murphy a favorit name
wid thim honest sons of toil ill say it
was but they was more remarkable for
variety even than number there was
blonde and brunette and albino murphys
colored and wop and lithuanian murphys

by frances a ludwig

and murphys wid a scotch burr to their
talk-which was about the ony ones that
had a right to the name there was anny
number of murphys that carried the
thought of sauerkraut and limburger right
wid thim-you did not have to wait till
they opened their mouths and we found
one chinee murphy the little magazine
murphy man said that manny of thim fur-
eigners whose names sounded like an in-
ternment camp had tried to camouflage
thimselves by adoptin a family monicker
more along the lines of popular taste just
then he was probably right

  but with all our exertions and trouble
we were no nearer gettin a line on the next-
of-kin murphy than wed been at first and
time was going poor nora was wailing
that shed niver see mike again-god rest
his soul-and now that he was gone wud
he forgive her for leavin him this way
and that her one consolation was that
father kelly had been wid him in the last
hours and may the blight of heaven fall
foriver on those that might have saved him
before it was too late achone achone

  the big man begun to fidget around
restless and prisintly he said look here
ive got to be gettin back and have me
sleep turn her around

   what you wud leave a lady in distriss
like this says the little man it cant be
i havent sized you up that way and im
seldom mistaken in me man says he givin
him a slap on the shoulder

   well and good says the big man
but this is not my funeral i have other
matters to attind to says he and ive
spent all the time i can spare gallopin
over these roads wid these two lunatics

 tchk says the little man we have
not gone to pasinskys yet drive there 
 but thats beyond the powdher-
works says the big man not for me
drive me back i say

  i had stopped for a minute to change a
spark-plug in spite of the protestin of
nora for the engine was fair meltin and
id no mind to be sued for damages by
anny of the machin tribe the little man
was holdin an electric torch for me to see
by and he took out his watch and looked
at it  tis bare one-thirty says he and
we are not quitters to give up the chase at
this early hour no indeed we will
lave no stone unturned to be of aid to this
poor afflicted woman we can take a cross-
cut road to pasinskys and get into gary
that way in no time lets go
a wild night in gary

   well make it snappy growls the big
man i thought it was later he dragged
his words a little and i knew at wance
that his wits were not as keen as they
might be and i remimbered the gurglin i
had heard a while back and wakin up
as you might say i took heed of more
that as the evenin and other influences had
progressed the red mans beautiful brogue
had grown less as if at times he forgot it
entirely and in the nature of things y
know it shud have been just vicey versey

i cranked her up and we started
 again and we reached the crossroad
where the bushes were thick and growin
close to the edge of the macadam you
know how it is out there a regular wilder-
ness but a couple of miles from town we
were in the middle of one of these roads
and whooping along when the flivver
stopped dead still

   i knew it says i

   whats wrong asked the little man
and nora weeps wid fresh anguish well
be here the night i see it tis the ind
of it all

   theres ivrything wrong says i but
i think the immejiate cause of our stoppin
is a short circuit in the timer wires have
either of you a bit of tape about ye if
not we may as well make ourselves com-
fortable till momin

  then the little murphy man who was
most resourceful produced a roll from his
pocket and says hell hold the torch again
and maybe i can fix the trouble and he
looks at his watch again and i see he is
kind of listenin and i also see he is keepin
close watch of the big murphy man

  him the big red murphy was rum-
blin and sizzlin inside of him something
tremenjous and then he explodes into lan-
guage the kind youll find indicated wid
stars and exclamation points when you
come upon it in the magazines nora
cried oh and clapped her hands to her
ears

   thats not pretty talk says the little
man stop it

   stop it will i roars the big man
wholl make me i see i must walk three
miles but as youre to blame for it ill
take time to wring your fool neck before i
start and he climbs out of the machine

   oh no says the little man gently
and at the same time steppin to the side
of the road you will ride back nice and
peaceable i assure you and as youre

the blue



forgettin yourself in the prisence of a lady
twill pain me to have to-

  the big man cut off his words wid a
lunge at him and the little man dances
around in front as quick as a flash and
yells throw up your hands and there
in the moonlight he stood wid a magazine
gat in each fist so close they was almost
touchin the big mans chest

  there was not a sound from the ma-
chine and nora was paralyzed wid fright

   frisk him says the little man to me
go round behind him and get his gun
dont be afraid i can shoot wid me left
as straight as me right and i wuddnt ask
a better target

  i did not know was it a hold up or
what but i did not think the time was
opportune for makii- inquiries

   ah-h says the little man as i pulled
an ugly bull-nosed forty-five from the big
mans hip now keep it pointed at him
and sidle around here and reach your other
hand in me side pocket put the whistle
youll find there between me lips

  at this the big man gives a jerk but
the little man yells steady and he stood
still again

  the little murphy man blew a blast
that wud have waked the dead and at that
same minute from the direction of the pow-
dher-works comes a regular hurricane of
pistol shots then the noise of shoutin

   ah-h says the little man again
theyve got thim

  the big man was pantin like a cor-
nered steer and of a sudden he made a
jump for the brush but he must have
caught his foot for he wint sprawling and
the little man fired two shots just to quiet
him and the big man sat up mournful and
held up his hands again

  then i cud hear quite a ways down the
road the sput-sput of motorcycles coming

   weve been shadowing you these
months corky schultz says the little
man theyve got your number in wash-
ington and you wont be hatchin anny
more plots like this for one while you
measly spy the likes of you to profane
a name like murphy the brogue comes
aisy to him he says to me for his mother
was an irishwoman to think that wid
even a drop of that blood in his veins he
shud be what he is

i begun to see light youre wid the

  	secret service said i

   i am and murphys me rightful
book magazine

name im sorry to have caused you and
the lady this agitation but youre little
excursion fitted into my plans beautiful
i knew the attimpt would be made to blow
up the powdher-works tonight and i had
the boys ready and i got orders to take
schultz he wud have made his get-away
at daybreak but i cud not arrist him too
soon and give the others warnin so i
thought to get him off quiet and wait-
then up comes three motorcycle police
wid the smell of gunpowdher on thim

  did you get thim all cries the little
man murphy

   we did that twas a grand haul
and in the very act of plantin a fuse

   then snap the bracelets on mr
schultz the brains of the party says the
little man and the deed was done

    if youll wait here a bit says the little
murphy man to me ill sind out a man
wid gasoline for i opened your pet cock
on the road awhile back and tis not the
short circuit on your wires that stopped
you though there may be one but because
youre dry i had planned to stop about
here where the boys wud be on the job and
in call at this time and i cud not take
chances on a miscue im only sorry that
we did not find your man

  wid that a little squib of a cop steps
up and says who is this why tis the
same chap that wanted to get in the pow-
dher-works early this evenin and had no
pass he is probably mixed up in this
thing and the woman too i will arrist
thim both as accomplices

  then i see it was the little shrimp of
an officer who was so chesty wid us in the
shank of the evenin

   youre wrong barney says the little
murphy man these people are  k
and theyve rendered me a great service
we will treat them kindly and sind them
home

   indeed and we will not says the lit-
tle cop waggin his head theyve been
tearin up and down the road disturbin the
peace and honest peoples sleep their
lights are out which is against rules and
beyond all that i think i smell liquor on
thim there are charges to be preferred
even if they had no hand in the powdher-
works job so we will take thim along
the little murphy man makes a sound
between a snort and a chuckle and begins
persuasive now barney listen to me-
at that nora who cud stand no more
comes down from the machine and steps

beside us her eyes were wild arrist us

chapter i
a passer-by

four years later bob hale was to
remember passing randolph tem-
pleton that night in the rain-re-
member it first as merely a coinci-
dence scarcely worth noting but in less
than another year not five in all after tem-
pleton splashed by that trifling incident
took its place in a tremendous tragedy a
thing that threatened to crush hale that
destroyed templeton and condemned
hales companion of the night dean haz-
ard to his doom

   that hale and hazard had recognized
templeton at all was because the wind was
at his back and their own umbrella had
been lifted at the cost of additional damp-
ness to reduce the dangers of steering a
course along the sidewalk of the south
shore village it was halfway from the
trolley stop to the willis house that tem-
pleton loomed in the dark their wind-
tossed hello brought him abruptly out
of his thoughts his lips moved mechan-
ically although his response was lost in a
swirl of rain that was all there actually
was of an incident that less than five years
i later was etched in lines of fire on bob
hales mind

and hazards laughing comment tem-
pleton looks as if he were carrying the
cares of the world instead of merely the
state legislature later hale remem-
bered that too how characteristic it had
been of our blindness a joke at temple-
tons serious aspect and yet how
prophetic of their perils truly temple-
ton walked that night with the future-
his own hales hazards-walked with
thoughts that were to upset the world for
them and others

  c arly that afternoon a fog had rolled
  in from the sea and on toward evening
  hale and hazard consulting in the drive
  apartment they shared had decided that
  the gray murk that clung clammily to the
  windows overlooking the river would make
  an automobile more of a nuisance than a
  convenience in getting out on long island

     lets not take the car they had re-
  marked almost simultaneously

    a queer expression came over hales
  face as he looked toward hazard there
  was a faint suggestion of a smile about
  hazards thin lips and in the lines about
  the corners of his gray eyes but all trace
  of it was lost in the eyes themselves they
  studied him coldly steadily seeming to
  look right into him


f charles kiisiper

  youre at it again hale complained
nervously

  we did seem to hit on it that time
agreed hazard and added tormentingly
but it could have been your reading my
thoughts as easily as me reading yours
who knows

  you know said hale quickly
youve done just that thing time and again
deliberately then he saw hazard was
laughing a quiet good-humored and al-
together disarming laugh and-well
hale finished lamely i wish you
wouldnt

  i promise laughed hazard tapping a
cigarette against his silver case then he
speculated gravely but seriously bob
it might be that youre reading my
thoughts

  there isnt a chance of it- hale had
begun earnestly before he perceived haz-
ards insincerity confound it anyway
he exclaimed in chagrin that was deeper
than he showed he really had known
some uneasy moments because of the in-
creasingly frequent occasions on which
hazard had spoken the precise thought
that was in his mind sometimes as in the
suggestion of abandoning the idea of mak-
ing the trip by automobile they had voiced
the thought at the same instant but there

were other times when hazard had put
hales thoughts into words before hale
himself could do it at first it had been
amusing bizarre afterward it had excited
a semi-scientific curiosity about thought-
transference but latterly it had irritated
hale he found himself wondering if haz-
ard could really read his thoughts with any
regularity if there werent moments when
they were alone in which the other had
made himself privy to things he had not
mentioned intimate things perhaps too
delicate for discussion the possibility
made hale uncomfortable each fresh
manifestation of the others uncanny power
stripped him of his poise while in haz-
ards presence and now he was distinctly
ill at ease

ljazard his cigarette lighted chose to

   make amends

  your idea about motoring down is cap-
ital he declared personally im any-
thing but keen about driving in a fog id
much rather trust to tracks than to my
imagination hale was resentful wary
at sea continued hazard where there
are no telegraph poles and ditches a man
may get by in a fog on dead reckoning
but ashore it would be just reckoning the
dead hazard did not refer again to his
the man who knew

the blue



excursion into hales thoughts and by the
time they dismissed their taxis at the long
island entrance of the pennsylvania ter-
minal it was forgotten-had become in
hale part of that subconscious force which
loyalty to the other would not let him
identify as distrust

  the train was well filled when hale and
hazard boarded it and the aisle halves
of seats opposite each other was the best
they could do hale sat in with a youth
who shrank toward the window without
looking up from the magazine he was read-
ing hazards seat-mate was a hulking
ugly-looking negro who only hitched over
when hazard sat down and even then
without yielding much of the seat the
train started almost immediately the roar
in the tunnel discouraging any idea of con-
versation and by the time the train was
again traveling above-ground hazard
seemed so intent on some subject of
absorbing thought that hale did not dis-
turb him

  for a minute hale studied the negro
beside the opposite window there was an
old scar on the fellows right cheek his
eyes were small and the whites bloodshot
the nose flat with wide nostrils and the
lips unusually thick even for a negro a
tough customer thought hale and draw-
ing an evening paper from his pocket he
began to browse through it in an effort to
kill time

  halfway to their destination the youth
beside hale rose and still absorbed in his
reading moved down the aisle-to be
hurled against the back of a seat knocking
a fat mans hat over his eyes as the train
stopped for his station hale moved over
to make room for hazard and through
the window he saw that the fog had lifted
and that it was raining

  we might have known it he remarked
to hazard in reporting the discovery we
could have come in the car as easily as
not

  were in luck that we didnt answered
hazard it seemed to hale that there was
something enigmatic in the reply he would
have pursued it further but his companion
was staring straight ahead in an intense
fascinated way peculiar to his periods of
deep abstraction instead of questioning
hale looked again at the negro now peer-
ing out of the window and then settled
once more to his perusal of the paper as
the train worked its way along the south
shore

ob began hazard some time later
hale looked up inquiringly well
but apparently hazard had reconsidered
his purpose for he muttered oh nothing
and drew the folds of his thoughts about
him

  when hale at the trainmans announce-
ment remarked heres where we get
out hazard started violently with a sur-
prised eh oh yes our stop hale
noticed the negro watching with clumsily
concealed curiosity as they rose

  the departing train left them in a wet
windy desolation a swaying arc-light at
the highway crossing showed the diagonal
streaks of rain and brought a dull gleam
to the windows of the closed shops opposite
the depot they were the only passengers
set down by the train now distantly
whistling its ghostly dirge for the next sta-
tion  the villages historic hack was no
where in sight the situation was saved
by the arrival of a less picturesque but
more persevering conveyance

  a trolley-car came rumbling up through
the night and stopped long enough on the
farther side of the railroad crossing for
the two travelers to get aboard as they
seated themselves for the brief ride to the
street on which the willises lived hale ex-
claimed say but wasnt that negro an
ugly looking brute im glad he didnt
get off with us

  hes going to the next station said
hazard quickly

  you talked to him asked hale in
surprise then closed his teeth over his
lower lip and avoided looking at hazard
there was an awkward silence hale was
certain that the other had not spoken to
the negro that any information he had
concerning the black man had come in a
subtler way than speech had come noise-
lessly on the silent wings of thought
hales own uneasiness returned the ten-
sion was broken by the conductors com-
plaining reminder fares

  afterward hazard talked along lightly
railing at long island insisting that its
semi-liquid consistency was proof that
long island hadnt been an island long
enough and was too recently risen from
the sea hale however could not shake
off the uncomfortable feeling that the two
experiences with hazards strange power
had given him it was not until they had
left the car and were literally launched on
the walk of two blocks to the willis house
that other interests crowded out hales
book magazine



alarm over the disturbing circumstances
they were valiantly steering their course
by the bleary street-lamp across the way
from the willis house when templeton
passed and hale who had been so upset
by hazards mental wizardry so fearful
of its consequences remembered later the
utter unconcern with which he brushed by
that other man who was to be so sinister
a figure in the pattern of the future

chapter ii
the willis girls

an willis was seated at the
piano no one with any apprecia-
tion of the artistic would have had
her sitting anywhere else and nan-slim
dark with the girlishness of less than
twenty and the womanliness of more than
nineteen-was appreciative nans was an
aristocratically oval face under an abun-
dance of dusky hair a face with well-set
eyes and lips that gave the illusion of just
being about to curve in a whimsical smile

  drifting over the keys her fingers re-
called absent a sweetly wistful melan-
choly little thing she loved she was sing-
ing softly

sometimes between long shadows on the
      grass

the little truant waves of sunshine pass-

  from the hall doorway came her sisters
voice that will win him nan

  the music stopped nan swung around
on the piano-bench to face her sister
catherine willis was not the striking type
of the girl at the piano nans hair was
dark hers was an intermediate brown
the most remarkable of catherines fea-
tures was not found except in searching
for some quality in her face that from the
first was haunting elusive her mouth was
sensitive her nose finely patrician her ears
where they peeped out from tinder the soft
luster of her hair were delicate her eyes
-that was it catherines eyes were
green strange gray-green eyes with golden
flecks in them nan was a flower perfec-
tion in itself catherines was the beauty of
the clouds shifting somber savage serene
-endless possibilities

  and catherine was all woman less
than four years older than her sister she
was nevertheless without any of the girlish-
ness apparent in the other this difference

by charles k van riper

may have been accentuated by catherines
dress of jade velvet

  you look wonderful catherine nan
exclaimed

  catherine laughed stepping into the
room you cant bribe me with flattery
but even at that i dont believe ill tell
him

  who demanded nan who are you
talking about

  why your nice bobby hale of course
catherine retorted undertaking to rear-
range a profusion of marigolds in their
shallow bronze bowl on the center-table

  i dont see why you should tease me
about bob observed nan didnt he
introduce you to dean hazard and
then

  catherine she asked curiously who
came when i thought it was the boys
catherine paused in arranging the flow-
ers with one golden flower uplifted oh
she replied carelessly a man trying to call
on some one of our neighbors-turned in
at the wrong house

  i wondered sighed nan i thought
it was bob and dean but then i knew i
could recognize bobs voice and i didnt
you rushed past me so fast on the stairs i
didnt have a chance to ask you cath-
erine ive got a notion you like dean
hazard

  catherine became very busy with the
marigolds silly what makes you
think that

i dont exactly know nan reflected
the way you act when hes around i
guess or when you get a letter from him
catherine rather disinterestedly asked
do i act differently

  seems to me you do declared nan
youre not like that with bert edsall or
cranston williams i used to think you
rather liked randolph templeton that
winter in california templeton is nice
enough i suppose and if he is kind of
conceited he has sort of an excuse for he
really has been splendid in the legisla-
ture but dean hazard is a perfect peach
dont you think hes nice

  catherine tweaked her sisters cheek ex-
claiming miss inquisitive then

  i hear steps on the porch

che went into the hall and opened the
 door for bob hale and dean hazard

  hello called bob this weather is
a fright

  isnt it catherine agreed and sug-
the man who knew

gested leave your umbrella there if
you will ill take your coats

  how have you been asked hazard
never better she confessed except
that both our maids have left

  not the new colored girl asked haz-
ard quickly

  yes was the reply what made you
ask the tone of the inquiry had sur-
prised her

  just that you had such a time to get
her hazard explained lamely

  hello nan cried hale as the younger
sister appeared in the doorway nan
rather pointedly ignored him to smile on
hazard and give his a pleasant hello
dean her recognition of hale was a
disinterested-and bob that came as a
sort of afterthought

  awfully glad you came she said
smiling on hazard fearful weather isnt
it

  but bob would not be denied say
but i was disappointed when you couldnt
come into the theater the other night he
broke in

  i was too nan answered then in a
changed tone she added its the strang-
est thing but id been thinking of you all
that day

  what were you thinking asked hale
hopefully

  nothing definite-just sort of vaguely
continued nan it wasnt until four
oclock i promised alice lawrence to be
at her dinner-party and sure enough at
half past four you called up

  thought-transference ventured haz-
ard with an amused glance at his discom-
fited companion telepathy-or whatever
you want to call it

  those things are awfully interesting
it happens so often that youll be thinking
of some one and then get a letter from or
about them and people really have pre-
monitions about things catherine had
the strangest experience when mother died
tell dean about it

  -i was at boarding school said cath-
erine lowering her eyes my first year
there one night early in february as i
was sleeping my mother came and passed
her hand over my forehead-that is i
dreamed she did but it was so real ive
always felt as if it actually happened
though she was in florida and i was at
school in ossining i woke all a-shiver
and couldnt get to sleep again for some
time when i looked at my watch it was

the blue



twenty-five minutes after three after a
while i dozed off but in the morning when
i woke it was the first thing i thought of-
it made me feel cold and creepy i could
see mother standing there i scarcely ate
any breakfast when i went to recitations
i began to laugh at myself for being so
silly-but before the first class was over
miss stapleton came to the door and asked
me to step into the hall she closed the
door and put her arm around me and
handed me a telegram mother had died
at quarter past three that morning

  nan added quietly she hadnt any
idea that mother was ill it was sudden-
heart-failure she was all right appar-
ently when she went to bed about mid-
night but at three oclock the attack came
on and she died in fifteen minutes

there was a silence at length cath-
erine rose do you want to play some
bridge she asked

  fine applauded hazard i owe you
a beating for the one you gave me last
time

  and the time before that added
catherine rummaging through a drawer
whats more i dont think you can beat
me tonight

   difference of opinion recited hazard
is what makes horse-races and politics
by the way youve rather a distinguished
 fellow-townsman in randolph templeton
considering the double handicap of coming
from long island and being a reformer
hes creating quite a sensation in the leg-
islature

  hes to speak at our thursday morn-
ing club catherine explained

  lets play in the dining-room said
nan i hate dinky little tables

   so do i agreed hale

  i say cant we stick to this room or
the library objected hazard concern-
edly

   the dining-room hale insisted

  you seem to be outnumbered dean
remarked catherine starting for the double
doors

  on to the dining room called hale
as he caught nans arm and started away
with her

  oh bob interposed hazard

  nan and hale paused turning yes
said hale catherine entering the dining-
room called come on

   will you excuse us for a minute nan
asked hazard
book magazine

  surely she said and followed her sis-
ter



by charles k van riper

ljale somewhat mystified retraced his
steps what is it he inquired

  you remember that darky who sat in
the seat with me on the train coming out
hazard began excitedly hales startled
expression was answer enough and hazard
went on bob that fellow intends to rob
this house there flashed before hale
the picture of a hulking black man with a
scarred cheek and a blue-black drooping
under lip he recalled hazards confident
statement that the fellow was going to get
off at the next station

  as if picking up the thread of hales
thought with certain fingers hazard ex-
plained he was riding to the next town
to cover his tracks here

  hales reaction to this reading of his
thoughts was surprising even to himself
he rose in sudden rebellion against haz-
ards superior power its all tommy-
rot he blurted you cant read my
thoughts any more than i can yours its
just your imagination youve let it run
away with you

  hazard smiled tolerantly and hale won-
dered if the mind back of those piercing
gray eyes hazards mind with its penetrat-
ing sixth sense had seen through the pre-
tense of ridicule perhaps said hazard
and moved swiftly to where the parted cur-
tains hung before the french windows
he looked out into the night the lips that
were parted in expectancy tightening into a
thin line hazard stepped back

  bob he said in a low voice would
you recognize that fellow through the rain
the width of the street away

  hale stepped nervously toward the win-
dow

  dont let him see you cautioned haz-
ard

  peering breathlessly past the edge of the
draped velvet hale could just make out
an indistinct figure moving in the deeper
shadows beyond the street lamp across the
roadway-a figure that blurred as it was
resembled that of the evil-looking black
man

  hale shuddered as he drew back
whatll we do he asked in a hushed
voice

  theres a wall safe in this room ex-
plained hazard he wont dare try any-
thing while were here

  nans voice came in protest from the

dining-room arent you ever coming
bob

  go in there directed hazard and
make some excuse for playing the game in
here

  hale looked at hazard with an expres-
sion that was almost awe then without a
word he turned and left the room

chapter iii
what the cards showed

with the same soft chime as
the first the eleventh stroke
drifted from the old clock in the
willis hallway floated through the silence
and melted away in the dim spaces of the
house a gust of wind swept a swirl of
rain against the french windows toward
the street but there was not a sound from
the four who sat intently at the little card-
table in the living-room it was hazards
lead

  catherine willis both hands closed over
her cards was holding them against the
jade velvet at her breast bob hale who
was dummy scowled darkly at the lamp
on the center table nan her lips pressed
tightly together was  leaning forward
slightly toward hazard her partner who
frowned intently at a spot on the table
over the upper edge of a fan of four cards
he held in his hand hale lifted his eyes
and stared at the strip of mirror over the
mantel but the others did not move the
silence continued then hazard gave a
short gasp and with his eyes on nans
laid the seven of spades on the board

  we win cried nan triumphantly
the rest are mine and the cards she
laid down proved her claim

  hazard smiling demanded what do
you say now catherine of course she
could say nothing for hale rather dis-
gruntled looked up from the score he
completed to announce their game and
rubber two out of three

  wasnt it exciting exclaimed nan en-
thusiastically i was just praying youd
play a spade it was our only chance but
from the way id played you couldnt
have guessed it i remembered our men-
tioning telepathy and wondered if you
could get my thought i concentrated on
that card so hard that it hurt she drew
her fingers over her temples

  thats what i imagined youd be up
to confessed hazard so i let my mind
 the man who knew

go to see if i could get the impression
of what you were thinking

  you did all right exulted nan
thats surely telepathy isnt it wonder-
ful

the cards had been put away after haz-
a ard had given another exhibition of his
uncanny power by naming one chosen se-
cretly by nan-and had failed at the same
trick with catherine

  hazard and catherine were talking tete-
a-tete

  nans breathless exclamation bob
caused them to face about

  what asked catherine but hazard
his face darkening exclaimed you
shouldnt have told her bob nan was
saying to her sister bob says a burglar
is coming here tonight

  a burglar echoed catherine

  hazard undertook to explain coming
out on the train i sat next to a negro in
taking the seat i bumped -against him and
felt what im sure was a revolver in his
coat pocket telepathy has been a hobby
with me and ive had some success with
it so i decided to try o find out what
he was thinking about the first impres-
sion that came tome was of a wall-safe
you have one here i believe he seemed
familiar with it all one of your servants
was colored

  you made a queer remark about her
when you first came catherine recalled

  this explains it hazard answered
adding bob and i are going to waylay
this fellow outside the house and muss up
his plans

  you mean things scolded nan you
wouldnt have told us a thing about it and
wed have missed all the excitement ive
never seen a real burglar

  you shouldnt have mentioned it bob
hazard rebuked his companion crisply

  we cant miss this chance catherine
exclaimed nan a real burglar well
help you catch him

  no said hazard resolutely shaking
his head you couldnt help if he saw
you leave the house with us-

  why leave the house demanded nan
cant we all wait for him here if you
caught him outside you wouldnt be able
to prove anything against him trap him
here in the house and youll have a clear
case catherine and i can watch

  but this fellow is a bad one objected
hazard and he has a gun

the blue



  he wont use it hale stated authori-
tatively those fellows carry guns for a
bluff they value their necks too much
to use them

  hale winced when nan observed quick-
ly i read that too but the remark
was quite unconscious nan continued
her urging come on catherine it
will be exciting

  and dangerous added catherine
  too dangerous declared hazard

  i dont think so hale asserted but
we could arrange it dean so the girls
could see without being in any danger i
rather think the fact that were waiting for
him will be such a surprise that hell for-
get about everything else

  it will be thrilling exulted nan
lets try it catherine

atherine considered her strange
eyes narrowed long oval pools of
smoky green when she spoke her tone
was low decisive im willing she an-
nounced then asked hazard when will
he be here

  if you really want to go through with
this thing he faltered nervously youll
have to do exactly as i say

  all right was nans answer sup-
ported by catherines thats agree-
able

  your father wont be home early
asked hazard

  wrasnt intending to come home said
catherine hes in town at the club
board of governors meeting

  i suppose this fellow knew that before
he started muttered hazard moving
over toward the french windows and paus-
ing before them now he explained
hes going to come in this way in
resting his hand upon the velvet hangings
hazard observed that the rain had stopped

  my plan is this he continued bob
and i will go make lots of noise about it
after a minute turn out this light one
of you go upstairs and light the light in
your room the other open the back door
for boband me when we leave well go
down the street and turn the comer as if
on our way to the station instead well
come down the next street across the back
lawn and in the rear way that wont give
him enough time to try anything before we
get back you two keep the lights burn-
ing as if you were getting ready for bed
when you hear bob and me come in turn
gut the lights bob will come upstairs for
book magazine



you now where can you watch without
being seen

  the room across the hall suggested
catherine we can watch him in there
she indicated the mirror above the mantel
and he wont be able to see us

  go in there and try it instructed
hazard turning to nan see if you can
make out the center-table

  nan swayed almost imperceptibly then
commanded come on bob

  why the center-table asked hale as
he was going out with nan

  thats where hes going to stop haz-
ard said with assurance to which hale re-
plied with a shrug of the shoulders nan
and her escort disappeared

  can you see asked hazard when his
reconnoitering party had taken up its posi-
tion in the other room

  uh-huh nan replied

  good was hazards comment and
going back to the card-table he picked it
up exclaiming well want this out of
the way he started from the room with
it

  ill get your coats offered catherine
going with him and speculated suppose
it doesnt work out as you say

  it will said hazard and a moment
later hale and he were struggling into
their coats hale interrupted the loud-
spoken good-bys to whisper in a worried
way look here dean is this to be a
regular fond farewell

  time for that later laughed hazard
we have to hurry now come on and
calling good night he dragged hale from
the doorway

chapter iv
the silent invader

a lone and back in the living-room
 nan willis twisting her fingers in
  the edge of her coral scarf faced
her sister catherine she confessed im
frightened

  so am i the other admitted we
shouldnt have agreed to it

  nan caught her breath but bob will
be back she consoled herself catherine
paused in going over to the table bob
she echoed scornfully nan youre hope-
less then she reached for the beaded
chain to switch out the table lamp

  oh cried nan wait till i get
started ypstairs she scurried for the hall

by charles k van riper

and from the foot of the stairs called all
right catherine darkened the lamp in
the house echoing with a rising wind that
had followed the rain there was only the
dim illumination of the low-burning light
in the hallway between the parted vel-
vet curtains at the windows was a ghostly
phosphorescence of pale moonlight its
terribly creepy complained nan

  bob will be back taunted catherine
as she reached the doorway into the hall
nan was scooting upstairs and catherine
went methodically to the switch that con-
trolled the light in the hallway

  dont cried nan in alarm from the
head of the stairs dont switch off that
light it might be wrong if theyd
wanted it done theyd have told us

  they dont know everything replied
catherine serenely go into our room and
turn on the lights ill open the back
door she switched off the hall light

  a faint frightened dont be long
catherine was prelude to the slamming
of an upstairs door catherine passed
along the hall crossed the kitchen turned
the key and drew back a bolt the back
door stood open a cold draft flowed
around her as she stood looking out at
familiar objects gleaming palely under the
light from a moon struggling through
breaking clouds after a moment cath-
erine turned and left the door through
which two silent figures entered a moment
later

  hazard and hale made their way along
the dark corridor to the living-room and
stopped near the table

  i knew nan would think about the hall
light exclaimed hale

  were idiots breathed hazard
swinging out of his coat get these
things out of sight if your friend saw
them hed be wise in no time without
a word hale took the coat and as he was
disposing of the outer garments hazard
drew his cigarette-case from his pocket
opened it and laid it on the table next
he removed the ash-tray and match-holder
from the center-table to the mantel then
he surveyed his ground and had just
moved to the window when hale came
back hazard was peering around the edge
of the velvet hangings

  come here bob he called softly
without looking around and lifting the
curtain slightly he said as hale came
alongside the black devil has put out
the street light
the man who knew

the blue

  do you suppose we ought to have gone
into this asked hale nervously as they
drew back from the window

  instead of answering hazard tersely di-
rected hurry and get the girls

a s hale left him hazard bent above the
table where the faint moonlight
crossed the glossed mahogany lay an ivory-
handled paperknife he picked it up ex-
amining it critically testing its weight
and at length slipped it into his pocket
then as footfalls sounded on the stairs he
stepped over to the doorway

  ill get hysterical or scream or some-
thing said nan breathlessly as she
reached the foot of the flight

  dont you dare warned hale and
put his arm around her drawing her into
the other room catherine paused to whis-
per bob told us about the street-lamp
it looks as if youre right

  its beginning to said hazard grimly
how long have the upstairs lights been
out

  five minutes- began catherine but
hazard cut her short with a warning
s-s-s-h  then he motioned her into the
other room and himself glided toward the
window flattening himself against the cur-
tain in the drip of the rain from the
eaves he caught the sound of some one
crossing the veranda followed by a scrap-
ing sound against the window-frame the
moon made enough brightness between the
curtains for hazard to see reflected in the
mirror above the mantel a towering black
shape silhouetted against the sickly light
he heard a quick wrenching and splinter-
ing and a swoop of wind swung the long
windows inward

  into the room stepped the hulking in-
truder-the jacket buttoned tightly over
his broad chest soaked with rain his cap
plastered damply to his pointed skull his
trousers streaked with water and his shoes
squishing oozily but for all his bulk and
sogginess he advanced lightly as a tiger
noiselessly procured a light chair and
turning it on its side propped it against
a section of the french window to prevent
it from closing and blocking his get-away
that done he drew together the velvet
hangings and stepping back lifted his
electric flash

  the cone of light that the negro turned
on the curtains revealed nothing but their
dull blue expanse it had been a breathless
business but hazard had managed to slip



behind the folds of velvet as the burglar
obtained the chair his ears attuned to an
incredible keenness he heard the stealthy
steps of the negro moving toward the cen-
ter of the room

  hazard dared to look around the cor-
ner of the curtain he could see the ne-
gros flash spraying the table center on the
cigarette-case and a heavy hand reaching
for the silver case abruptly the negro
straightened up

ljazard dodged back in time for al-
though the flash was turned on the
velvet hangings the housebreaker appar-
ently attributed the movement that had
alarmed him to the draft from the opened
window that was now swaying the curtains
gently but after that hazard kept cover
the negro was not using his flash now
hazard could tell that by glancing along
the wall against which he was flattened
again he caught the catlike movement of
the man this time toward the mantel and
hazard was sure the matches the scrape
of a safety match against its box verified
his surmise and brought a startling sequel

   rising through the stillness of the house
was a strident shriek of horror a hysterical
screech from nan in the other room haz-
ard glided noiselessly from his hiding-place
in time to see the face of the negro re-
flected in the mirror by the light of the
match a swart ugly face flat-nosed the
eyes rolled in terror toward the sound as
they showed the bloodshot whites it was
onlyfor an instant then the negro dashed
the match to the hearth and with the
house still ringing with the scream plunged
the room into darkness

  springing back from the betraying glass
the burglar collided with the advancing
hazard and quickly as he had drawn his
revolver it was knocked from his grasp
hazard drove his knee against the small
of the black mans back crooked an arm
around his throat and with a quick twist-
ing heave floored him before he could re-
sist the negro fell heavily and the pant-
ing hazards pinioning of his arms and
planting of his knee at the pit of the
others stomach was a quite unnecessary
precaution

ljale had run in and switched on the

	 lights and the girls stood in the
doorway nan shrinking against catherine
get the gun bob directed hazard in-
clining his head to where the automatic lay
book magazine



nan gasped and catherine caught her
breath as hale darted over and picked up
the weapon aim it at him hazard in-
structed then rising he said to the ne-
gro get up

  sullenly the burglar sat up rubbing his
back where hazards knee had hit it and
grunting lifted his ponderous bulk put
up your hands ordered hale the black
man obeyed shuffling his feet and looking
around him when he saw the sisters
standing in the doorway he grinned

  whats your name demanded hazard

  dunstan sir paul dunstan he re-
plied in a surprisingly smooth musical
voice without further words hazard ad-
vanced and began to go through the mans
pockets one produced a pair of dice a
rabbits foot and hazards own cigarette-
case

  thanks hazard remarked ironically
as he slipped the case into his own pocket
the other side of the coat yielded a bur-
glars jimmy fashioned out of a short cold-
chisel bent at one end with a flat lip to fit
under a window-sash there was also a
razor and a babys shoe hazard felt of
the mans hip pockets and was about to
place the confiscated articles beside the
others on the table when his attention was
attracted to the outside breast pocket of
the coat his exploring fingers closed on
and brought forth a small medicine-vial
filled with white powder

  cocaine hazard pronounced it hold-
ing up the bottle a frightened look came
into dunstans eyes don take it away
from me boss he whined and stretched
out his hand for it

  keep your hands over your head
snapped hale

  don take it pleaded dunstan jerk-
ing up his hands gimme a blow of it
just one blow before you turn me over to
the police the black man dropped to
his knees jest a little-go ahn boss
theyll send me away for a long trick go
ahn boss

  hazard shook his head and putting it
on the table with the other things said
disgustedly get up off your knees
then he added whered you learn to
use it

  in prison sniveled the giant negro
rising

  youre lying hazard told him

  no ah aint

  you are said hazard where did
you learn

by charles k van riper

  around harlem dunstan confessed
why did you say you learned in
prison demanded hazard you cant
get it there

  thats what gives templeton and the
other reformers a foundation for their
claims said hale of course he didnt
learn in prison

you aint never been in prison said
dunstan his eyes longingly on the vial
friends give it to you hazard asked
they aint friends and they don give
it to us corrected the black man theys
keepers and they sells-

  bob said hazard abruptly phone
for the police

  lets not do that dean interposed
catherine let him go

  let him go repeated hazard

  i think so too whispered nan and
hale taking that as his cue argued yes
dean lets turn him loose if we have him
arrested theyll be dragging us down to
police headquarters and the courts and
continually running after us with sub-
poenas

  i dont think it would be as exdting as
i imagined acknowledged nan it would
have been different if he had been a gentle-
man burglar

  gentleman ejaculated dunstan in
surprise why ah aint no lady bur-
glar

  the others laughed and hazard point-
ing to the window said clear out dun-
stan get out of here if i ever see you
again ill have you arrested on the spot
the black man who had entered with
the shiftiness of a panther shuffled toward
the window hesitated and turned his gaze
resting on the treasures on the table
boss he said kin ah have mah good
luck

  good luck repeated hazard mysti-
fied

  yes sir explained dunstan that
babys shoe and the rabbits foot

  let him catherine interceded and
hazard said come and get it and be
smart about it dunstan shambled over
to the table and gathered in the furry foot
and bootie in a huge paw that he left ly-
ing on the table as he rolled his eyes to-
ward hazard and suggested hopefully
and the dice

  he might as well ventured catherine
and with hazards nod the black man drew
the dice in with the charms and in lifting
them made a deft sweep that also gave him
the man who knew

the vial of cocaine drop that ordered
hale before dunstan could lift his re-
trieved goods from the table and the negro
glanced up to find the automatic pistol
close to his face he considered the
muzzle with a sickly expression reluctantly
letting go of the cocaine

  get out snapped hazard and dun-
stan scuttled across the room to the win-
dow there he paused but hazard
checked any renewed appeal with an
abrupt clear out the negro turned
swung through the window and disap-
peared

  poor fellow said catherine pityingly

  wasnt that awful seeing his face in
the mirror exclaimed nan the horror
of it filling her eyes

  hazard was inspecting the cocaine turn-
ing the vial between his thumb and fore-
finger rotten stuff he muttered and
flung the bottle into the fireplace

  better lock that back door hadnt
we proposed hale who had moved to-
ward the hall doorway yes said nan
quickly catching up to him hell be
coming back that way and slipping her
hand under hales arm she started off
along the hall with him

  hazard drew out his rescued cigarette-
case well he said you see i guessed
the right card

  it seems so agreed catherine and
paused uneasily then she suggested sit
down dean they wont be back for a
while catherine chose a chair beside
the table and dean leaning against the
edge of the mahogany asked why were
you so quiet tonight he had lighted his
cigarette before catherine parried was
i quiet

  you know you were catherine in-
sisted hazard flicking the match into the
fireplace you made me feel blue too

  im sorry dean she said and then
rallied but you know repartee is what
you think of after you get home or after
your guests have gone

  thats more like you laughed haz-
ard then suddenly serious he said
catherine theres something i want to
ask you

  the gray-green eyes darted swiftly to a
distant corner of the room before they were
raised inquiringly to hazards penetrating
gray ones not my age i hope she
temporized

  hardly hazard replied but since
youve mentioned it how old are you

the blue

  oh dean youre hopeless protested
catherine dont you know that a
woman who will tell her age will tell any-
thing

  hazard bent toward her thats what
i want you to do he breathed tell me
everything tell me-

  dont dean she checked him with a
frightened catch in her voice

  you know what im going to ask
catherine nodded yes she said
chokily

ljazard flung his cigarette to the
hearth and seated himself on the arm
of her chair i suppose you do he be-
gan and rushed on recklessly ive been
dead in love with you catherine for-for-
ever it seems i dont believe you or any-
one else could help but see it will
you-

  dont she gasped

  why do you put me off catherine
he asked you know-

  you cant tell me this she protested
desperately

  i want you to be my wife

  no dean i cant her head was
back her eyes half closed

cant why he demanded catching
her hands in his dont you love me
yes she whispered then contradicting
herself furiously as she freed her hands
no no i dont

  hazard rose is there some one else
he asked

  dont she pleaded

  who is it he insisted and as she was
silent named edsall williams gor-
don

  none of them there was a hysterical
quaver in catherines tone

  not began hazard not- he
paused at loss for a name

  dont look at me like that catherine
screamed im afraid of you
wh-why stammered hazard

  dont dont begged the girl rising
unsteadily dont look at me hazard
tried to catch her by the shoulders but
she drew back gasping dont touch me
dont look at me im afraid of you-
afraid of you she was retreating step
by step leaving hazard standing stupefied
in astonishment

  you can read the cards cried cath-
erine you knew that man was coming
youre worse than that man who came
through the window youre a thief too
book magazine

she was backing toward the door you
come to steal my thoughts go away from
me youll find out at the doorway
she paused her hands to her head in
frenzied fear the fingers loosening strands
of her hair

  you knew-youll find out-im
afraid she wailed dont look at me-
i wont let you find out then flinging
her arms over her head she shrilled de-
fiantly youre not going to find out
catherine swayed caught herself and
swinging around staggered dizzily toward
the foot of the stairs a glance over her
shoulder showed hazard approaching she
cowered crouched behind the newel-post
and sobbed passionately dont look at
me you cant steal my thoughts go-
go i never want to see you again im
afraid she had begun to crawl up the
stairs but stumbled to her feet and with
a hysterical laugh rushed up the rest of
the way

  just as hazard utterly at a loss to ac-
count for all this arrived at the doorway
nan and hale reached it from the rear
part of the house whats wrong whats
the matter they demanded and nan
without waiting an answer ran up the
stairs calling catherine catherinei

  what is it old man asked hale

  reaction after the excitement lied
hazard then he suggested dazedly
come bob wed better be going

four years later

junius was puttering around in the
lounge of the de soto club junius
always puttered doubtless some
african ancestor had spent an entire after-
noon arranging and rearranging seven not
dissimilar cocoanuts to get them in order
of size but however he came by it junius
puttered for the last ten years he had
been doing his puttering in the livery of
the de soto club and although it was not
generally known in the vineyard of the
lord in conjunction with his service at
the club he held forth on the sabbath in
the pulpit of one of the unknown metro-
politan churches exhorting a dusky but
devoted flock to forsake evil and contribute
to the hymn-book fund

  the table beside which junius was
standing was of an age that made its com-
moner wood more precious than ebony or

by charles k van riper



teakwood around it the de soto clubs
imposing board of governors gathered
monthly in this room of dark paneling with
its cavernous fireplace the chairs of the
directorate stood around the table but
there were other chairs luxurious leather
ones placed at random about the room for
those who might care to lounge there on
evenings when the board did not require
its quarters

  it was from the cross-street that patrol-
man michael mcquade came into the de
soto he stuck his head around the edge
of the door without attracting the negros
attention and seeing that the uniformed
colored man was the only occupant of the
apartment asked are you the janitor
junius straightened up and wheeled
around janitor exclaimed junius in-
dignantly and haughtily supplied the in-
formation im one of the clubs boys
boys the policeman repeated tak-
ing into account the traces of gray in the
kinky hair maybe you were but thats
a long time ago then advancing into the
room mcquade asked have you a
phone a man can use the call-box on
the corner is out of order

  before replying junius passed the police-
man and stepping out into the corridor
pointed along it and said jes down the
hallway there

  in turning to follow the directions mc-
quade noticed a small table in a corner of
the room with a hand telephone on it he
stopped asking whats the matter with
this one

  jes down the hallway junius re-
peated but in vain for the bluecoat had
advanced toward the telephone in the cor-
ner ill try my luck here

  thats special for the governors ju-
nius protested impressively

  the governors eh puffed mcquade
didnt know he was away from albany
long enough to have a private line here
well the big moguls not around

  bohd of governors junius said faint-
ly breathless at the sacrilege

  boards here does he exclaimed the
twice-mistaken mcquade picking up the
phone well its a swell lay-out ju-
nius showed a disposition to hover in the
doorway mcquade waved him away
youre excused shine he informed him
me and the loo-tenant dont like people
listening in on our conversation and as
junius still hesitated the officer added
gruffly beat it
the man who knew



junius left and mcquade after craning
his neck to see that he really was alone
addressed himself to the puzzle presented
by the telephone a black bar with mouth-
piece at one end and ear-piece at the other
with never a way of knowing which was
which after considerable twisting and
turning of the instrument the policeman
looked less exasperated and feeling suffi-
ciently encouraged said guardedly give
me bryant   bryant   
oh you got it well youre supposed to

  hello he resumed presently this
the rialto novelty shop  this you
abe this is mikeput miss raf-
ferty on the phone will you

  hello angela rafferty  guess
who this is   howd you know
say angela im in a swell dump-down to
the de soto club class to me eh

howd i get in walkedlisten

angela i called up to let you know id
be around tonight when youre closing up
the benevolent association meeting is
called off good i should say it is good

 all right see you later

good-by 

  as he set down the phone patrolman
mcquade regarded it fondly and sighed
an-ge-lah turning slowly he went to
the door and looking down the corridor
saw junius watching the doorway with a
worried look hey shine he called
and when the slave of the room came up
he settled his hat with all the rakishness
the department would stand for and an-
nounced the governor can have his
room im through with it

  bohd of governors muttered junius
as mcquade swaggered off toward the
street door junius was silently visiting a
voodoo vengeance on the departing blue-
coats broad back when a voice behind
him asked whats the trouble junius
dont tell me that the club has been
raided

   junius knew without looking around that
the speaker was robert hale and as he
turned assured him earnestly oh no sir

mr hale and with a mercurial change
of attitude toward the offending mcquade
he explained blandly the officers a
friend of mine it seems sir like the
police alarm is out of order and knowing
me he naturally felt he could jes step in
here and telephone to the station-house
junius had followed hale into the room
and busied himself with a non-existent spot
of dust on the great glass dome of the

the blue

table lamp the officer was jes a friend
of mine

   hale settled wearily in one of the easy
chairs is mr gaffney here junius he
asked

  mr gaffney of tammany hall sir the
gentleman who was here to see you-all
week before last asked the negro and
as hale nodded said i havent seen him
sir

  you would have seen him if hed come
in hale inquired

   well sir i might miss him began the
colored man sagely but mr gaffney he
aint never missed nobody these politi-
cians never miss no one course they dont
come right up and say hello junius  and
start in talkin they seem so busy sort-
ing out presidents and congressmen and
governors all the time that the man who
gets nodded to thinks its a right nice favor

special for him

  hale laughed appreciatively junius
he asked whats your last name

   fenner sir the negro replied rev-
erend junius fenner

   well well thats new to me confessed
hale are there any more ministers
working around the club

   none that you might call parsons sir
but that tall yellow darky wellington hes
a deacon and the coat-room boy hes an
elder of my congregation

  you dont say so exclaimed hale
i suppose you get around among the mem-
bers of your church how do they stand
on the election for governor do they like
mr baker

  mr baker the man you-all and mr
gaffney is backing junius repeated i
should say they do sir emphatically

   you think hell get their votes asked
hale

  some of them-although mr temple-
ton being what you might call a local man

has his supportersbut personally

im for mr baker

  and your views carry some weight
with your congregation you wouldnt
mind saying a word or so for mr baker
would you

   glad to do it mr hale glad to do it
and perhaps you can arrange a smo-
ker suggested hale

   just as easy as nothing at all sir said
junius confidently

   your expenses hale inquired

  well faltered junius -twenty-five
dollars-

  hales hand went into his pocket
dont go short he cautioned then
drawing out a roll of bills and counting off
five tens handed them to him heres
fifty

  thank you sir thank you muttered
junius bowing obsequiously then he an-
nounced as if it were an inspired revela-
tion i know mr baker is going to be
governor

  dont mention it was hales disclaim-
er then he added i saw some one
who looked like mr gaffney pass the door
see if you can find him-

  yes sir said junius and started to-
ward the door with a spryness that his
years belied he all but tollided with a
portly person chewing a cigar carrying a
newspaper and wrapped in glum silence
junius backed away bowing and proclaim-
ing i beg pardon mr sandford 

the stoutish man thus addressed grum-
 bled something unintelligible and en-
tered the room as junius turned along the
hall to the newcomers dispirited eve-
ning hale bob from his chair replied
hello sandford wont you sit down
sandford silently drew up a chair and low-
ered himself into it laying the unfolded
paper over the arm whats the good
word hale pursued

  none

  youre looking down in the mouth
hale observed

  i ought to

  street

  hit me an awful kick

  so what went wrong asked bob
since this political game has gotten so
warm i havent had time to keep up
scuttled for one hundred thousand dol-
lars sighed sandford and i wasnt the
hardest hit

  what was it asked hale quickly

  o k copper sandford replied with-
out outward emotion

  i sold the last of mine two weeks ago
remarked bob

  sandford shot a swift glance at him
to hazard

  yes hale was surprised curious
and he came to town today- began
sandford bitterly

  hazard did broke in bob how
much did he clean up

  about half a million

  wow ejaculated bob thats the
seventh time in the last year hes put it

over not as big as the others though
there was central-

  dont go over them sandford inter-
rupted irritably i was in on three
what id like to know is how the devil he
knew it when he got your stock we
planned to get him he got us but
damned if i know how it was a closed
deal-five of us wed all been stung and
were laying for him no one could have

tipped him offsay what do you

know about hazard

   not a great deal replied hale

  you used to live with him snapped
sandford

  that was four years ago bob ex-
plained since then ive had very little
to do with him business once or twice
the o k transaction two weeks ago was
the first id seen him in more than a year
hale shivered

  do you believe- sandford began
awkwardly you dont think- then
he asked bluntly how about this mind-
reading business

li ale was evasively silent and sand-
ford went on remember that story
in the papers about a writer who produced
a manuscript and witnesses to prove that
six months before it appeared he had writ-
ten word for word the poem that was
printed over hazards name that was a
queer affair and ive heard rumors-
for a moment sandford gnawed his cigar
in silence then demanded directly is
there anything in this talk of telepathic
power

  thats why i left him hale confessed
studying the reflection of the lamplight on
the oak table top but i dont like to
talk of it he shrugged his shoulders
and i seldom have

  thats all right hale reasoned sand-
ford but here ive dropped about four
hundred and fifty thousand dollars to this
fellow i dont think im asking a great
deal when i ask what you know about him
-and that nasty habit of his of putting it
across sandford viciously hurled his
cigar across the room and into the fire-
place have a cigar he asked fum-
bling in his pocket

  thanks said bob accepting he
drew out a match shared it with sandford
and having blown out the flame continued
blowing on the charred -stick before he
said i tell you frankly sandford i
dont know a great deal about hazard
the man who knew

  but you- sandford began to pro-
test

  yes i know i lived with him hale
admitted he was in my fraternity at
amherst he was always rather a pe-
culiar sort he was quarterback on the
eleven and caught for the ball-team you
remember the write-ups he used to get on
the sporting pages for his quick thinking
he seemed to size up situations almost in-
tuitively but he was a quiet fellow and
studious they tell me he was a senior
when i was a freshman and it wasnt
until we were both out of college that i
got to know him well i say know him
but i doubt if anyone has ever really
known hazard i met him here at the
alumni club in the city and we took an
apartment together lived on the drive for
a time got along first-rate too i dont
know when this telepathy thing struck
him but all of a sudden he began answer-
ing my questions before i could ask them

  theres one night i will never forget
hale went on hazard used to go with
me when i called on nan-my wife now
she has a sister catherine-perhaps you
know her hale then narrated the inci-
dents of the night they had captured the
negro burglar we caught the burglar
hale concluded and then nan-no one
could deny her anything ive been mar-
ried three years and havent yet-asked us
to let him go we did afterward hazard
and catherine were alone suddenly nan
and i heard catherine shriek it was the
most frightened cry ive ever heard haz-
ard never explained it neither did cath-
erine

  after that hazard and i lived together
for about four months he got morose
bitter-and almost fiendish in the way he
could tell what i was thinking before
long i had the feeling that he knew every-
thing that was in my mind it was a
frightful sensation i cant imagine any-
thing more horrible not long after i left
hazard he cleaned up his first one hun-
dred thousand dollars in the market i
met him later and asked him how he had
done it

   vandegrift tipped me off he said to
my immense surprise didnt know you
knew him i remarked hazard grinned
in a devilish way never spoke to the
man in my life he said just happened
to be alone with him in a pullman club-car
early one morning and he was think-
ing 

the blue



  why the beggar practically admits that
he used telepathy exclaimed sandford
unless its just a pose i wonder if theres
anything in it

  there was a half-million in it for him
today according to you hale pointed out

  there couldnt have been any other
way agreed sandford his newspaper slid-
ing unnoticed to the floor as he rose it
gives me the creeps

  imagine what it was living with him
hale rose too havent seen gaffney
he asked and when sandford shook his
head he suggested come along and help
me look for him

together they left the room and were
a short distance along the corridor
when randolph templeton stepped from a
telephone booth templeton was a tall
man with black hair combed back smooth-
ly brown eyes and a way of walking that
made it seem as if he was always conscious
that he was in the public eye

  governor templeton sandford greet-
ed him holding out his hand

  i hope so templeton laughed a little
too casually but friend hale may have
something to say about that he released
sandfords hand to give bobs the briefest
of clasps

  the people you mean retorted hale
more power to them templeton said
it as if he suspected it might be steno-
graphically transmitted to the body pol-
itic then added you know hale im
sorry your father made his money as a
brewer if he had been thoughtful enough
to have done it in some other way his son
might have been busy boosting my cam-
paign instead of getting his amusement out
of politics by fighting me

  and my father might not have made his
money was bobs answer it would
have been a simpler solution if you had
refrained from being a reformer-carrying
the prohibition fight down to a generation
that is dry how are things going

  i think ill win templetons confi-
dence verged on a boast

  i dont declared hale but we wont
quarrel im taking sandford to the grill
to get him some coffee and since its your
kind thats responsible for it being only
coffee ill be hanged if i ask you to come
along

  they parted sandford and hale pro-
ceeding leisurely toward the clubs de-
natured bar
book magazine

chapter vi
broken barriers

parting from sandford and hale
templeton was continuing down the
corridor when he saw junius about to
turn in at the room where he so diligently
did nothing oh junius he hailed

  the colored man stopped in the doorway
and with a gleaming smile and scraping
bow murmured yes mr templeton
you were about to ask me something
when i was called to the phone remarked
templeton coming up to the door

  not exactly ask you sir explained
junius i was aiming to tell you that we
had a most satisfactory prayer-meeting last
wednesday

  yes templeton was one of the few
who had been aware of the colored mans
place in the clergy but he was puzzled as
to the pertinence of this information

  yes sir continued the darky i and
from the talk my flock likes the looks of
you-all for governor

  im glad to hear that expanded tem-
pleton

  that is sir all but a few sir junius
went on to say there are some that
kind of favors mr baker but i was
thinking sir that might be made all right
if there was some kind of a smoker or
since the ladies have the privilege of the
ballot say a sociable so the sisters could
join in

  if youd like me to come and speak
broke in templeton -with the election
so close im afraid-

  it wasnt that sir interrupted junius
rather caught off his stride then he boldly
suggested but the expenses-

  ah exclaimed the reform candidate
i think i see what you mean but you
know junius the election-law doesnt al-
low-

templeton became suddenly silent
looked past the negros shoulder stiff-
ened and turning abruptly walked away
in the direction sandford and hale had
taken junius gasped in astonishment at
this strange behavior then with a squeam-
ish sensation he glanced around what he
saw sent him swiftly into the room with
the pretense of busying himself he picked
up sandfords deserted newspaper hoping
that the danger would pass when after
an interval he dared glance around his
worst fears were realized

by charles k van riper



  regarding him silently from the doorway
was a terrifying figure a man who might
have come from the tomb with dead-
white skin that made his face a chalky
mask in which were set eyes that were
alarmingly alive as if they were looking
back upon life out of the misty gloom of
the beyond they were gray eyes keen
as points of tempered steel and looking at
them gave the singular impression that
they forced the unwilling body to further
functioning in order that they might con-
tinue in the existence for which the rest of
the man had little liking-indeed even a
decided distaste

  there were indications of age about tjhe
man that could not however hide com-
pletely marks of unmistakable youth if
the flesh was pallid it was nevertheless
without flaccidity there were lines in his
face but closer inspection would have
showed that they had been brought by un-
seasonable sorrow and care and were not
the inevitable creases of time and the
shoulders while stooped slightly were
broad their strength not spent but sus-
pended altogether it gave him an un-
canny appearance of agelessness an illu-
sion that he was of a world apart projected
into the earthly order of things and not
subservient to the natural laws of the to
him strange state -of being

  to junius this creature fif incongruous
aspect was a startling apparition the
fact that he had known the dean hazard
who four years before had been as debonair
as any younger member of the de soto-
this in no way lessened the terrifying
effect of his appearance the colored man
struggled to avoid meeting the weird gray
eyes hazard picked his way toward a
chair beside the fireplace and reached it as
junius after a series of maneuvers was
about to bolt from the door

  the man in the chair checked him
junius let me have that paper

  yes sir the servant answered huskily
and fetched the paper asking uneasily
anything else sir

  just a minute said hazard looking
straight into the negros eyes then haz-
ard said slowly as if reading from a printed
page no junius i dont think thered
be any great harm in cutting down on the
expenses for the smoker and saving some
of the fifty dollars- for the hymn-book
fund	

  the negros eyes expanded in terror his
body quaked he reeled around dizzily and
the man who knew

with an inarticulate cry dashed for the
door

  for an instant there was in hazards
eyes a faint suggestion of amusement in
contemplation of the colored mans roguery
but it quickly gave way to a haggard
haunted expression he stared for a time
into the cold black recess of the fireplace
then lifted the paper that sandford had
abandoned and began to read

cometime later sandford returned to
 the room the back of hazards chair
was toward him and he could not identify
its occupant nor in point of fact did he
attempt to deep in thought he chose
another chair settled himself to think and
puff his cigar quite unconscious of haz-
ards proximity a fluttering of the paper
as a page was turned apprised the stock-
transaction victim of the others presence
as he realized the identity of his neighbor
sandford glared at the back of the head
that was all but concealed by the chair
hazard lowered the paper with a sudden-
ness that made sandford start fearfully

  the paper was dashed to the floor and
hazard leaped to his feet strode across the
room and stood over sandford

  take that back he panted

  what gasped sandford sinking
into his chair then he stammered weakly
i didnt say--r- good god

  no you didnt say anything mr sand-
ford agreed hazard brokenly stepping
back and brushing the back of his hand
across his forehead you didnt say any-
thing i beg your pardon

  sandford looked wildly at his recanting
accuser then gasped in a suffocating con-
sciousness of guilt in thought that was
technically innocence because it had not
been spoken he struggled up from his
chair lurched heavily past hazard and fled

  the gray eyes were filled with the
shadows of care as hazard walked un-
steadily to the fireplace steps sounded
outside the doorway and turning hazard
discovered junius standing there beside
him a blonde pasty-faced fellow who
seemed of swedish ancestry

  there he is gulped junius nodding
toward hazard and instantly disappear-
ing

a lone in the doorway the swede
seemed to gather himself mr haz-
ard he asked in excitement he was barely
able to repress

the blue



  yes replied hazard and as the other
came toward him repeated rapidly impres-
sions that preceded the uncontrollable tem-
pest of accusation that was about to burst
the barriers of the others silence

  the triplex motor announced haz-
ard you say i stole it you invented
it

  the advancing man was momentarily
staggered by this reading of his mind he
hesitated but his anger carried him on
you stole it he cried stole it you
thief youre admitting it triplex bah
its the carlstrom motor my motor mine
oscar carlstroms ten years i worked to
make it

  as the accuser advanced step by step
two other men appeared in the doorway
one was james j gaffney political boss
and his companion was ed thomas a
useful lieutenant

 ten years i worked to make it
stormed carlstrom as he had declared him-
self ten years two years i have
saved to get the money then i go to patent
it and you-you have stolen it

  hazard backed away from the man now
almost upon him and as he retired ex-
claimed dont yell what do you want
to kill this last hazard himself all but
yelled there was a movement of the
mans hand toward his hip gaffneys warn-
ing get that gun the glint of steel a
tangle of figures with carlstroms voice like
a chant of vengeance shouting as he fought
twelve years of my life you take my
life i worked and you stole ill make
you pay pay for every year pay-pay
carlstroms tirade broke off short with
a grunt and he thudded to the floor
thomas straddling him and possessed of
the pistol now what do you want
demanded gaffney thomas stepped clear
of the prostrate man and forced him to his
feet

  i invented a motor mine all mine
and gasped the swaying swede pointing
at hazard he stole it

  what about it hazard asked gaff
ney

  the fellows crazy was the reply

  he stole it patented it insisted cari-
strom

  have you patented a motor gaffney
asked

  last month-the triplex-new system
of valves explained hazard

  he robbed me carlstrom moaned bit-
terly
book magazine

stop your whining ordered gaffney
did you ever see this gentleman before

  no but he took it muttered carl-
strom

p affney turned to hazard the mo-
tor was your own invention he
asked politely you didnt buy it from

anyone

  it was my own was the answer -a
new arrangement of the valves hazard
remembered the moment the idea had come
to him crossing to the lackawanna ter-
minal on a crowded tube train

  its mine insisted carlstrom

  how is it you accuse mr hazard
gaffney demanded

  his name wras on the patent grant

  come gaffney objected hazard
dont you think weve had enough of
this he drew out his card-case and ex-
tracted a square of pasteboard from it
he can come to my office tomorrow if he
wants to talk about it ill listen then to
what he has to say

  thomas took the card and handed it to
carlstrom see him tomorrow he ex-
plained the swede blinked at the card
for a moment then lifting his eyes glared
at the man he believed responsible for his
wrong ill make him pay he began
again but thomas -taking him by the
shoulders propelled him toward the door
reiterating he says come to his office
tomorrow and still muttering the man
was pushed through the doorway

  hazard outwardly calm was in a seeth-
ing tumult the idea for the motor he
had been sure had originated with him
perfunctorily he took leave of gaffney and
his lieutenant and then moved to the door
and down the corridor

  he had been sure the triplex motor
had been the product of his own brain his
own mental processes leading to a fresh
inspiration and yet-perhaps this blonde
madman was right it might be that in
that crowded tube-train the idea had come
to him from some one else-carlstrom
but how could he be sure tomorrow if
the fellow came he might be better able to
judge but could he be certain he had
reduced the last barrier between himself
and those around him their minds were
unwalled fortresses into which he could
walk unchallenged their thoughts were his
without conscious effort how was he to
know what was theirs what was his
where would it end

id thomas observation as he
sank down into a chair beside his
chief was the fellows crazy
which one asked gaffnev

  the swede

  humph sniffed gaffney they both
are jim gaffneys way of saying things
with finality was one of the things that
made him secure at the head of an invisible
government which in spite of outward vi-
cissitudes had lost surprisingly little of its
strength in a rule of more than two gen-
erations in appearance gaffney might
have been a moderately well-to-do mer-
chant

  wheres our amateur politician asked
thomas

  well soon see promised gaffney and
looking around added press that call-
bell by the door ed

  pretty good annex to headquarters
chief ventured thomas as he performed
the suggested task but it aint as pri-
vate as joes place the opposition ought
to know were hard pushed when we get
down to calling on contributors to the
fund thomas resumed his chair what
are you going to tell him

  gaffney delayed his answer to direct
junius who appeared in the doorway
call mr robert hale and as junius
went off gaffney confessed why i
dont exactly know ed i wish we were
riding templeton instead of baker

  hes clean and no mistake comment-
ed thomas -the first our outfit has

failed to get something on

  theres two weeks yet prophesied
gaffney

  good record in the legislature back of
him ruminated thomas

  yes said gaffney ive given up try-
ing to turn up anything against him polit-
ically of course the traction interests are
back of him but we cant make people
believe it he doesnt even know it him-
self

  and theres no mud declared thomas
ive talked with the gang in the district
and theyve never even heard of him do
we give it up

  with templeton in exclaimed gaff-
ney we couldnt get a thing as long as
theres a chance of putting baker across
were fighting for him

  but we havent a chance chief ar-
the man who knew

gued thomas i havent said so till now
but ive known it for two weeks theres
nothing against templeton political or
personal no muck no mud you couldnt
dig up anything in his record i couldnt
dig up anything in his family or him
you didnt look in the right place
protested gaffney theres just as much
-things just as interesting to us in evening
dresses and stiff shirts as there are in
kimonos and ready-made suits

thomas looked up as hale appeared in
the doorway and whispered to gaff-
ney here he is now

  hello bob said gaffney cordially
with a barely perceptible gesture warning
thomas to silence

 howdy jim-and thomas hale
greeted them then he observed to gaff-
ney you wanted to see me

  thats why im here gaffney ac-
knowledged

  hale drew up a chair but before he sat
down asked how are things going
bad replied gaffney

  were not going to be beaten was
bobs anxious inquiry

  oh not as bad as that gaffney as-
sured him i still figure baker a winner
maybe it wont even be close but then
again it may

 that story in the paper about-
about- faltered hale

  about your father gaffney finished
yes that hurt a little thats why i say
it may be close

  and we cant even take a chance on
that declared bob seating himself

  thats my idea exclaimed gaffney
weve got to win

  hows the money holding out was
hales next question

  moneys all right

  what then

  the man said gaffney

 not our man not baker hale
asked

  baker gaffney laughed nothing
wrong there its templeton

what about him hale was puzzled
gaffney affected a burst of frankness
say bob what do you know about him
i know hes too full of theories isnt
practical- hale began innocently gaff-
ney cut hr hort yes but personally
hes -nod sort a bit conceited
then the import of gaffneys question
struck him now look here jim he

the blue

m

  protested when i went in on this we
  agreed thered be no personalities no mud-
  slinging-

    sure we did gaffney soothed him
  and there wont be

    well then- faltered hale what
  you wanted me to tell you was whether i
  knew any scandal about templeton
  whats the idea

    youve got me wrong pleaded gaff-
  ney

    then just what do you mean by know-
  ing anything about him personally de-
  manded hale

    its this way gaffney explained
  weve looked over everything he did in the
  legislature both assembly and senate and
  we couldnt find a thing

    thats all right asserted hale then
  people can choose strictly on the platforms
  on what we promise them

    past performances win boy observed
  gaffney and all those of templeton
  that show are good

    but maybe theres something covered
  up objected hale

    which gets right back where i started
  from declared gaffney there probably
  is a lot covered up now you know and i
  know that hes tied up with the traction
  people breckenridge owns him heart and
  soul hand and mouth but hes covered
  up that connection so that nothing shows
  against him he was in on the prison in-
  vestigation grab too but hes left no traces
  and hes actually talking about reforming
  the penal code and abolishing the death-
  penalty we know these things but we
  cant prove em if we tried to tell the
  public without producing the proof wed
  be laughed at and whats more wed de-
  serve it for you know as well as i do that
  its ridiculous to make an assertion and
  then expect people to swallow it without
  evidence to back it up we cant show a
  thing against templeton politically

    and so you want to make it personal
  hale remarked well im through the
  minute you start

    can you turn up anything in his rec-
  ord challenged gaffney

i havent tried was hales answer
well thomas and i have gaffney
retorted rather impatiently and we
couldnt thomas nodded his assent and
added not a thing

    well i guess i couldnt then hale
  admitted but personalities dont belong
  in politics
book magazine

  the idea sounds good declared gaff-
ney but its a mistaken one when a
man goes after public office the people
have a right to know something about him
all about him public and private if
there are personal things he doesnt want
known he doesnt have to he isnt forced
to run for office now youre templetons
kind your folks know his folks you
know him and how hes known-

  what do you mean by that asked
hale sharply

  gaffneys blue eyes fixed the others he
said slowly a man is known by the
woman he keeps

liale rose white and angry gaffney
thats raw he exploded you prom-
ised youd be on the level in this fight
you are arent you he scoffed when
i went in i knew i couldnt bring about
clean politics but i did think i could make
them cleaner your line is the dirtiest kind
of thing in plain terms its blackmail
youre wrong asserted gaffney

  not for a minute hale insisted indig-
nantly youll get the name of some
woman and link it with his then publish
it in the filthy newspapers that are looking
for your patronage-

  youre wrong maintained gaffney
thats rough stuff we dont pull it get
this straight templetons a strong horse
you have to ride a strong horse with a
curb we want the curb nothing in the
papers-just go to him quietly and let him
guess what we know theres a weak spot
in every one of us templeton has his and
about the only thing left for it to be is a
woman

  bobs chin was squared determinedly
he said through clenched teeth if youre
expecting me to find out who it is youve
got the wrong man

  you want to win dont you taunted
gaffney

  not that way hale flung at him
you dont want all this bunch around
here to laugh at you asked the other
leaning forward in his chair

  i dont care replied hale if its on
the level-

  is there anything that isnt on the level
in the way i suggest demanded gaffney
nobody knows but you and me and
thomas and templeton what is there
dirty about that politics is no childs
game if templeton had anything he
didnt want known he had no right to get

by charles k van riper



into it youre fighting him now it isnt
baker against templeton or gaffney
against templeton but hale against tem-
pleton theyre watching you boy youve
got to win

  but not that way snapped hale

  do you know what it means to be a
loser asked gaffney significantly

  i dont know anything about temple-
ton anyway hale declared

  i didnt suppose you did bob gaff-
ney employed a mollifying tone youre
not the kind to go prying into things and
spreading scandal but you may know
some one who is- it isnt the loss that will
count its the precedent it will make
once a loser always a loser its a hard
job to get on the winning side if you dont
start there and dont think for a minute
that templetons crowd would have scru-
ples about blasting a few reputations to
win bob hale tensed suddenly

  look at the story about your father
they turned loose in the papers yesterday
continued gaffney in an insistent whisper
brewer grafter-there wasnt a thing
they didnt call him they even drag back
the dead

  but that was a lie cried hale unable
to keep silent all lies no gaffney
you cant twist me around i wont have
anything to do with it if i play straight
and clean and lose all right i wont go

down into the dirt to wingood

night hale turned on his heel and
started toward the door

  and youre going to let them get by
with that about your father said gaffney
scornfully as thomas and he rose

  hale wheeled that wasnt true he
retorted angrily

  oh wasnt it asked gaffney owlishly
and put his tongue in his cheek

this hale took a threatening step to-
ward the older man jim gaffneys
ethics may have been questionable but his
fighting qualities were not to be doubted
he had unsuccessfully tried his wiles on
hale but he wasnt beaten waonly just
beginning to fight stepping forward to
meet the other he demanded bullyingly
say young fellow how does it happen
youre with us

because my father was one of the par-
tys leaders hale answered steadily
-sentiment more than anything else
sure that was the reason you wanted
to be taken in growled gaffney but
the man who knew

the blue

why were we willing youre pretty close
to the organization you know

  because im not close with my money
i guess hale replied

  well your money has been a help
sneered gaffney but if you had five times
as much it wouldnt have been safe to have
taken you in unless we knew you and were
sure of you or-

  you knew me all right laughed hale
bitterly wanting me to make the mud-
puddle for you to get ammunition to sling
at templeton you knew me all right 
you interrupted broke in gaffney
i was saying unless we knew you or
something about you or your people
just what are you driving at asked
hale

  you saw the paper bullied gaffney

  i said i did

  well- gaffneys pause invited the
other to draw his own conclusions

  gaffney you-you mean thats the
truth stammered bob

  about half of it observed gaffney
blandly theres more besides lots more
and now ill tell you why i wanted to see
you i know the whole story a yarn that
would make your hair curl-billions in
boodle i know it all and any time im
of a mind to turn penitent i can get my
price for it son i was letting you down
easy before this time ill tell it to you
straight templetons got us beat unless
we can get him and get him quick ive
gone my limit and i dont propose to be a
loser im right ready now to get out from
under go over to the other side with
enough weight to bury baker deep as last
years leaves and if i tell the story your
father-

  you cant bully me flared hale
whos trying to gaffney snarled i
just wanted to give you fair notice with
thomas following gaffney started from
the room passing hale and reaching the
door before he turned

  as i say he repeated im just giving
you fair warning if we get something
about templeton something good we can
still put baker over its up to you
gaffney i cant go through with it
hale declared miserably i hardly know
what kind of stuff you want and i certainly
wouldnt know how to go about getting it
if i did

  then find out sneered gaffney and
taking thomas arm he added im be-
ginning to feel penitent -eh ed



chapter viii
a shot in the dark

left alone bob hale shaken by
gaffneys veiled disclosure retraced
the steps with which he had started
to leave ther room and sank down in the
chair before the fireplace there he sat
fumbling with the golden flower pinned to
his coat and going over gaffneys pro-
posal his attempt at persuasion and
finally the crude threat there was some-
thing sickening about it all his father
hale was wondering about it when a voice
began to whisper in his ear repeating his
very thoughts

  you dont know whether its true about
your father

  the suddenness of it paralyzed hale
he knew the voice was hazards and even
as he turned exclaimed dean the
friend of four years before was smiling
cynically then he began to repeat his im-
pressions of hales thoughts

true i can find out for you wheres
gaffney  dont know dont want

me to try all right i wontyou

remember your father taking you to see
gaffney of course you do so he wants

you to get templetonof course i

covld find out five minutes with him
alone and his thoughts-

  for gods sake dean go away you
make me cold all over

  hazards thin lips formed a twisted smile
as he continued so i make you
nervous now sorry bob sorry and we
used to be such good friends

  hale shot up from his chair unnerved
by the others reading of his thoughts
keep quiet he cried desperately ive
got to talk go ahead and read what im
thinking but dont repeat it like that
its too ghastly ive got to speak yes
gaffney wants me to get templeton-says
if i dont hell drag my fathers name
through a scandal that will rock the state
whatll i do dean for old times
sake-

  old times sake echoed hazard bit-
terly and you shudder at the sight of
me remember bob i know you by what
you think not what you speak its all
here now hazard tapped his head
nothing here-with a flick of his fin-
gers over his heart no sentiment all
reason cold hard ugly logic by the way
bob are you sure you havent some feeling
about being a loser confound it yes
book magazine

youre right youre only

               

human- sobbed

how would you go about finding out   
oh you dont want to i believe you dont

want tobut if you did

  i dont protested hale i dont

ijazard stepped close to the other his

	nervous hands clutching the sleeve of
bobs dinner-coat his fingers twining in the
cloth but if you wanted to know he
argued you dont that was pro-
nouncing hales decision but if you did

i know a wayive never failed

  abruptly hazard stopped his eyes on
the marigold in hales buttonhole cath-
erines favorite flower catherine he
asked in a voice strangely changed sub-
dued tell me about her bob

i-i love her

  oh catherines all right stammered
hale awkwardly

  i love her bob hazard ran on
that night was the crossroads life or-
or this hell that ive gotten myself into
i said it had never failed but it failed
there bob and that was failing in every-
thing this thing-this thing thats got
me has given me everything-money
power everything bob but its lost me
her and only a few minutes ago bob i
found i had lost myself i cant tell any
more what thoughts are mine and what are
those of the people around me ive lost

catherine lost myselfher eyes-

are they still-

  hale was anxious to get away but did
not know how

  her eyes pleaded hazard

  still gray-green with those gold flecks
in them hale answered uneasily

  catherine is the only person ive want-
ed bob said hazard brokenly and
shes the only one whos beyond me my
hearts stronger than my head remember
that night the cards i couldnt tell the
ones she held thats because of whats
here his hand was pressed against his
breast she was the only one who ever
put me out of balance the cards and the
other business fool and she was afraid
of me catherine was afraid of me now

everyones afraid of me hates me

youre afraid of me i have no friends
not a friend im a leper-alone

suddenly hazard began pawing at the
marigold hale with repugnance held off
his hand and contrived to unfasten the
flower here he said take it
hazard grasped the flower greedily and

by charles k van riper

catherine then in a burst
of passion he cried templeton cant
beat you bob damn him-ill tear it
out of him five minutes alone with him
and ill tell you all you want to know

  i dont want to know anything hale
burst out angrily thank god im
through with that he rushed to the
doorway paused as if to speak but said
nothing and stumbled off along the cor-
ridor

ir a time hazard stood fondling the
golden flower a sad brightness in his
eyes then his face settled again into its
sinister lines and his eyes snapped with
dark determination he walked swiftly to
the doorway and pushed the call-bell
when the answering junius appeared haz-
ard directed tell mr templeton some
one wants to see him-here

  yes sir said junius and started to go

  dont say who it is warned hazard

  i wont sir the colored man assured
him

  hazard moved stealthily around the
room he tested the double doors to the
corridor to see that they swung freely and
smiled with grim satisfaction as he found
the key in one of them hazard closed
one half of the door and as he caught the
sound of some one approaching along the
hall slipped behind the other templeton
stopped at the doorway

  in here he called back to junius and
as the reformer looked around the room
lighted only by the lamp on the table the
negro from a distance replied in the affirm-
ative

  theres no one here objected tem-
pleton then added perhaps he stepped
out for a moment

  most likely sir junius agreed faintly
and templeton entering crossed the room
to the chair by the fireplace and sat down
hazard slowly began the noiseless closing
of the door and turned the key

  as the key grated in the lock templeton
turned curiously and at the sight of haz-
ard he sprang to his feet

  whats this demanded templeton

  hazard had glided across the room to the
opposite side of the oaken table from the
other

  what do you want asked templeton
nervously

  what youre afraid i want was haz-
ards jerky reply

  standing theye in the lamplight with
the man who knew

the blue

his eyes on templeton hazard seemed to
have a fascination for the other temple-
ton took a half dozen uncertain steps to-
ward the table

  i want to know what you dont want
me or anyone else to know said hazard
templetons hands were on the back of one
of the directors chairs drawn up to the ta-
ble hazard started to seat himself on the
other side at the same time saying sit
down templeton your knees are shak-
ing

  like a man under a spell templeton
lowered himself into a chair opposite haz-
ard who continued

  yes thats it the story about the
woman-girl was she-and you you
were young then but it was you just the
same the same you that wants to be gov-
ernor try to keep it from me conceal it
the harder you try the more you think of
it and the easier it makes it for me to
read templetons face was white
strained moist

  california hazard went on relent-
lessly a dance  concentrate tem-
pleton try to keep it from me-thats the

wayoh this is fine moonlight

music the girl-then an automobile ride
along the coast-the california night-the
beat of the music

  you devil  breathed templeton you
cant find out

  dont be a fool templeton you know
i can

yith a swift movement templeton
 drew a gun now clear out he
said icily

  templeton youre insane laughed
hazard harshly you cant pull the trig-
ger against the death-penalty in our
prisons and pointing a gun even if it
didnt mean murder what would happen at
the election put it down templeton
thats right put it down

  templeton let the gun slip from his hand
to the table

  i wasnt the one who was saying that
gloated hazard it was what you were
thinking

  im not afraid of you blurted tem-
pleton in shaky defiance your mind-
reading stunts dont impress me try them
out

  youre a fool templeton you know
youre afraid i know youre afraid you
know im going to find out hazard
laughed again dont tell me it makes



it easier words snarl things up thoughts
come straight its clear now the music
the night the ride and then-youre a
frail lily templeton now the girls
name her name was- try to keep it
from me templeton her name-her
name- the marigold fell from his
twitching fingers to the table-top

  hazard seemed baffledand as he kept
muttering templeton lifted himself by the
arms of his chair her name-the girl-
why cant i get it raged hazard her
name was-

  a hand darted across the table for the
revolver another tried to knock it away
the lamp toppled to the floor with a jan-
gle of glass dashing the room into dark-
ness a chair was overturned  hard
breathing-a gasp-then a shot

  there was the thud of a body falling
heavily the clang of the revolver against
the pedestal of the upset lamp and the
sound of running footfalls in the direction
of the window the curtain was yanked
aside

  clutching the edge of the curtain in a
blood-stained hand stood hazard ghostly
in the indirect light from a street-lamp
and in the pale gleam the lifted curtain ad-
mitted to the room lay templeton face
down cheek against the floor mouth open
and a dark splotch spreading on the car-
pet there was a banging at the locked
doors to the corridor

liazard leaned toward the window but
 people in the street outside were stand-
ing still seemed to be looking right at
him in the babel beyond the doors he
could catch his name and templetons
then a deeper voice commanded stand
back all of yez hazard shrank from
the window there was a heavy impact
against the doors to the hallway they
rocked and burst open catapulting a streak
of blue into the room

  it was patrolman mcquade who had
entered the club earlier on very different
business in three strides he had clapped
a heavy hand on the bewildered hazard

  keep back all of yez ordered mc-
quade knotting his hand in hazards col-
lar dont be coming in here disturbing
things to hazard he announced exult-
ingly ive got you me bucko there
was a momentary pause then hazard
spoke

  yes he said angela rafferty will be
proud of you
book magazine

  mother of god gasped mcquade re-
leasing his grasp how did you-

  hazard made a break for the window
overlooking the street passed between the
portieres kicked out the glass with his feet
and dodged behind the hangings mc-
quade plunging in pursuit and shouting
hes gone to the sidewalk some of
yez crashed through the shattered win-
dow and leaped into the street

  the policeman eluded hazard swung
back into the room colliding with sand-
ford and others who poured in at the
doorway junius keeping discreetly dis-
tant switched on the ceiling-light as two
of the crowd seized hazard

  in the blaze of light hazard saw the
marigold on the table with a tremendous
effort he fought clear of the men holding
him and stumbled toward the golden
flower his fingers caught the fragile stem
and held onto it although he crashed to
the floor under the onrush of his captors

chapter ix
the distant shore

toward daybreak on a morning of
the following march keeper blod-
gett standing watch outside a door
in the death-house at sing sing prison
turned to greet a person approaching
good morning chaplain

  how is hazard inquired chaplain
fairfield nodding toward the cell door

he was sleeping when i came on
watch said blodgett and still is
good exclaimed fairfield softly
there was a pause then the keeper
asked any word about the fowler
bill

  the newspaper boys here on the haz-
ard story tell me their offices say its a close
fight related the chaplain the legis-
lature has been in session all night and
governor herrick is at his office in the
state house ready to sign the bill and
make it instantly a law

  and it will keep hazard out of the
chair inquired blodgett

  positively was the chaplains answer
the way the bill is drafted not only pro-
hibits the sentencing of a man to pay the
death-penalty for crime but forbids legal
execution even if it wouldnt automat-
ically stop proceedings here i understand
that the supreme court has prepared
stays in all cases of executions pending to

by charles k van riper

become effective in event of the capital-
punishment bill becoming a law i havent
any doubt that hazard would escape

  life terms would be all right but ill
tell you chaplain blodgett complained
id hate to have this fellow hazard as a
steady thing it gave me the willies on
my first trick of standing watch last night
to have him in there repeating every
blasted thought that ran through my head
an unusual case remarked fairfield
more to himself than to the keeper both
the man and the situation i dont re-
member anything that has caused a bigger
furore from the first templeton running
for governor and advocating prison-reform
and doing away with the death-penalty
shot and killed by this-i hardly know
what to call him

  ive said from the first he was crazy
commented blodgett no motive

that was my idea in the beginning
admitted the chaplain a crank as-
sassin but now that i know the man i
cant say that and i certainly dont be-
lieve he was in the baker-gaffney rings
game he knew young hale but hale made
a clean breast of the thing at the trial and
still it was mystifying hale told of gaff-
neys wanting him to pry out something
about templetons private affairs told of
repeating this to hazard or rather of haz-
ard reading it from his thoughts then
theres a lost link hale declares he had
no agreement with hazard to attempt
templetons secret if he had any it
doesnt connect up

  ill never forget that election said the
keeper shaking his head slowly at the
thought of it how milo herrick stepped
into templetons place and licked the
stuffing out of baker

  with the templeton murder as a back-
ground chimed in the chaplain but to
me the most exciting part of it wasnt the
election but hazards trial

  thats right observed blodgett you
went to the city while it was on

  no one who was there can ever forget
it declared fairfield nor can they
think hazard was crazy insanity consists
of delusions we all have them more or
less but hazard has none he sat there
before his judge and jurors and looked into
their minds as you or i might look into
shop-windows he saw their prejudices
accused them of them in a way that in
any other case would have constituted the
the man who knew

the blue



most flagrant contempt of court but
hazard completely upset things it was
different from any other case in the whole
history of the law if it was like any at
all it was like the witch courts-ignorance
sitting in judgment on knowledge for the
fact is that compared to his keenness his
power of perceiving thoughts where others
must wait for their expression in words
the men around him were dull minds in-
deed

  they never proved where he got the
pistol remarked blodgett

  hazard claimed to the last that it was
templetons replied the chaplain and he
never retreated from the contention that
templeton shot himself whats more the
state never proved that he wasnt telling
the truth you should have seen the at-
torney-general acting as special prosecutor
sweat when he was cross-examining haz-
ard trying to trip him up when hazard
could go back of the spoken question and
see the trick in the others mind no
there were lots of things they didnt prove
but they convicted him sid blodgett
smugly

  ignorance always condemns what it
cant understand observed the chaplain

  the keeper starting suddenly with a
warning s-s-h peered through the
grated door i thought i heard him mov-
ing explained blodgett as he turned back
to the chaplain but i was wrong may-
be not as a general thing but in this ca i
wouldnt mind if the chair did its work
not in any case said the chaplain
firmly

  doesnt the bible say the wages of
sin is death 

  death is thewages of other things as
well observed fairfield including vir-
tue good or bad were all paid in that
coin the death thats meant isnt the
death hazards going to at daybreak the
death thats coming to you and me it is
a different death that is the jvage of sin
the death of happiness health hope
from behind the grating of the door came
a hollow voice adding

  its what ive been through life with-
out any illusions a gray earth without the
green of self-deceit stark trees without
the leaves of dreams light without sun-
shine night without the merciful dark

phaplain fairfield nodded to
 blodgett who withdrew to some little
distance

  we cry for truth went on hazard
but if we knew all of it we would be
eternally damned truth destroys dreams
hopes a star is a shining mystery in the
night but science truth takes us to it and
shows us a clod of dirt like this on which
we live truth is as much misery as con-
tentment as much the ugly as the beauti-
ful if we knew all it would cramp us like
this cell only where truth is at a dis-
tance are we free our course is that we
seek to know when it should be enough to
feel the echo of hazards voice lost it-
self in the prison of stone and steel

  hazard said the chaplain gently you
are about to die

  and you think it will be merciful
hazard caught up the others thought
quickly youre right anything is bet-
ter than knowing the truth

  my office is to comfort you began
fairfield

  but you realize that you cant added
hazard voicing the chaplains thought

  i only know that you have revealed a
gift strange and appalling

  youre right in being glad you havent
had to go through with what i have mur-
mured hazard still busy with the others
thoughts

  take what you will from my mind
said the clergyman there will then be
no need for me to tell you that my sorrow
is sincere if there is anything to be
thankful for it is that your hideous cer-
tainty of things will end with life-that
you do not know what is beyond

  nor you said hazard then he asked
remember that bible you gave me
hazard left the grated door reappearing
almost instantly with a small thick book
and saying as he opened it ive used it
im glad remarked fairfield

  used it for this hazards hand was
extended between the bars holding a flower
pressed flat a marigold now brown where
it had been golden fairfield knew the
story of the flower from the time hazard
had torn himself away from his captors to
snatch it from the table over the lifeless
body of templeton through the trial in
the grim courtroom hazard had held the
fading golden flower a fantastic touch
wholly unrelated to the case a flower that
must have fallen from hales coat that
witness had testified and that hazard said
on the stand he had picked up from the
floor just before templeton walked into
that room and to his death and now in
book magazine

the valley of the shadow at the brink of
the abyss hazard jealously displayed the
withered flower for an instant and then
gently folded it again in the book of the
christian god

  im not going to talk to you of my be-
liefs said fairfield after hazard had re-
turned the book to his cot and was back
again at the door then taking the hymnal
from his pocket he explained from
something you said i think you may like
to hear-

   lead kindly light  finished hazard
before the chaplain could say it

  you know it asked fairfield

  no replied hazard you were about
to say it i just anticipated your words

  here said the clergyman as he found
the hymn in leafing over the pages

   lead kindly light amid-  began
hazard faintly there penetrated into the
depths of the prison the rumble of thun-
der

  would you rather read it yourself
asked the chaplain extending the hymnal

  i dont need the book hazard re-
plied if youll just follow silently along
the page ill read it from-from-

 from my mind even in the per-
formance of his office the clergyman found
a fascination in the power of this strange
man he lowered his eyes to the book
hazard recited aloud

  lead kindly light amid th encircling
     gloom

    lead thou me on

  the night is dark and i am far from home
    lead thou me on

  keep thou my feet i do not ask to see
    the distant shore

  hazard stopped abruptly fairfield
looked up questioningly

  the distant shore hazard repeated
slowly thats it chaplain thats whats
wrong with all of us we keep clamoring
to see-to know we lose the present in
reaching for the future to see to know
they dont realize the destruction that
they tempt ive known-known every
last mean foul unhealthy thought of those
ive lived among ive known their selfish
cruelty their conceit their lust ive
known things about them that they have
refused to recognize in themselves ive
known the present as perhaps none other
has ever known it and i know as no other
can what hell it would be to see the winding
path of life ahead and know its end
there was another dull echoing of thunder

by charles k van riper



  one man continued hazard the
man you serve knew the cup he would
drink and it was bitterest before it touched
his lips the great ordeal was in geth-
semane not on calvary blind were piti-
ful enough but seeing knowing who is
there could carry through life the cross of
his fate if there is a future life chap-
lain i will not ask to see-just to be a
child again a child to whom everything is
wonderful the distant shore i like that
chaplain hazard stopped with a twisted
smile

  but its not so distant now he pur-
sued after a moment suppose when i
was twenty i had known about this this
death-house that little door that swings
only one way could i have gone on
four years ago chaplain a little more than
four years ago i dreamed of a different
shore if i had seen this this one on
which i am about to step

ouddenly the prison whistle broke the
stillness like the wail of the wind sweep-
ing across some moonstruck heath

  a prisoner escaped exclaimed fair-
field nervously alert

  behind the grated door hazard was
smiling its a black man named dun-
stan-a burglar he said he started
planning the break more than a month
ago

  the chaplain looked in a startled way
at this interpreter of things unseen the
prison whistle was a bloodhound already
baying at the heels of the fugitive leaping
in unerring pursuit whatever the direction
its quarry fled and instantly overtaking
him and as it echoed in the ears of the
man making the furious flight for freedom
the wild alarm of the whistle was calling
up a cordon of vigilantes to close around
him on the countryside and throw them-
selves into the man-hunt

   blodgett strode up rapidly

  its that big buck negro dunstan he
told the chaplain repeating the word that
had been passed along from a distant part
of the prison fairfield nodded and blod-
gett hurried back down the corridor the
baying of the whistle continued

   for a space hazard was silent then he
said this prison chaplain people
think of us here as being penned in they
imagine that were caged up with all the
world around us it isnt that way at all
chaplain its as if these walls were
around the world and we couldnt get at it
the man who knew

he broke abruptly then asked is it
near daybreak

  very near was the quiet answer

  but its dark beyond the window
there was thunder loud enough to startle
hazard whats that he asked quickly

  theres a heavy storm coming down on
us explained the chaplain i watched it
as i dressed

  then there wont be any light the
whistle was wailing

  the chaplain shook his head watching
hazard with his eyes a trifle misty and
as he looked the man behind the grated
door tensed with a convulsive tremor and
screamed some ones talking about me
some one says im innocent i am inno-
cent templeton shot himself thats
right he did he did

  blodgett came rushing up

chapter x
at the eleventh hour

governor herrick was fum-
bling nervously with the phone on
the desk in his office in the state
capitol he was alone in the big room with
windows looking out to the east the
shades at the window were drawn and the
doors at opposite ends of the room were
closed the one led into a private hall-
way which gave the governor egress from
the building and beyond the other was the
anteroom and the desk of his secretary
from behind that door there came a click-
ing of typewriter keys

  the electric bulbs burned wanly as if all
but worn out by their night-long work and
there were dark rings under the governors
eyes and an ashiness to his face that told
of hours of suspense pushing back the
phone he scowled at his watch it was ten
minutes of five the governor went to
the windows and raised the shade it was
pitch black beyond he turned away and
restlessly returned to his desk again con-
sulting his watch he pressed a button
that buzzed for beggs his secretary the
clatter of the typewriter ceased and beggs
appeared in the doorway

  have you finished the formal notice to
the warden asked the governor

  just through with it beggs replied
are they any nearer a vote on the death-
penalty proposition

  dont know muttered the governor
havent heard a word from gallatins of-

the blue



fice again he drew out his watch and
this time asked say jim what time is
it

  five after five announced beggs
glancing at his own timepiece

  five after  exploded herrick damn
this watch im fifteen minutes slow sure
youre right

   positive

  we cant afford to wait another min-
ute declared the governor rising
abruptly hazard dies at daybreak not
that we give a hoot about him personally
but-

  beggs was studying his watch he
goes to the chair in about twenty to twen-
ty-five minutes

  its beyond me why they chose gallatin
floor-leader  stormed herrick fowler
himself would have been a better man
gallatin is a procrastinator listen jim
get down there as fast as you can and tell
gallatin to get a ballot on the bill

  beggs was already moving toward the
door

  stay there the governor called after
him and bring back word of what hap-
pens get to gallatin and make it strong
its the biggest chance we could have
beggs disappeared closing the door behind
him

the governor began to pace the room

    taking out his watch he viciously set
it back muttering as he adjusted it cross-
ing to the door into the anteroom he
passed through it and returned with a
paper fumbling for his nose-glasses as
he straightened out his arm to untangle the
ribbon to which the glasses were fastened
the silk fabric broke at the catch and the
glasses flew out of his hand smashing
against a comer of the desk striding over
to where the shattered bits lay herrick
wrathfully surveyed the wreck when he
was calmer he lifted the sheet of paper
squinted at it scowled at it and shaking
his head hopelessly tossed it to the desk
the telephone rang imperatively governor
herrick caught it up

  yes this is the governor he said
gallatins office well its about time
how is it going ready to ask for a vote
hang it it ought to have been done an
hour ago

  oh exclaimed the governor mincingly
after he had lectured a moment bradys
been blocking it has he opposition ob-
structing a vote then he roared into the
book magazine

phone well you tell gallatin for me
that hes got to get this thing through or-
or-therell be another floor leader

  the governor hung up the receiver with
a bang frowned at it for a moment then
took a turn across the room and back end-
ing beside the lifted shade at the window
the night had grayed slightly the phone
on his desk began to ring again and her-
rick hurried over to it

  hes speaking snapped the governor
a woman in the gallery fainted this is
the governors office not an emergency
ward oh she does eh well tell her
she cant see me tell her im home in
bed he snorted as he hung up the phone
and again began striding back and forth
he stopped as the door from the anteroom
was flung open

  its all off announced beggs entering
you mean they didnt pass the bill
the legislature has adjourned until
ten oclock in the morning

  whose work is that herrick de-
manded angrily

  comstocks

  the stubborn fool seethed the gov-
ernor that piece of business may tear
up our program for the entire session hes
let bitterness against hazard-

  hazards name wasnt mentioned ex-
plained beggs

  why mention it fumed the governor
you know comstock and his little set of
radicals theyre with us on this capital
punishment question you know that
beggs as well as i do but they couldnt
see that the important thing was to carry
the bill before daybreak today i thought
wed gotten them into line why if it had
gone through if wed saved hazard we had
the world in front of us it was the foun-
dation of our whole plan by revoking the
death-penalty pronounced on the man who
murdered templeton our partys leader
our administration could have commanded
the public confidence as in no other way
but no adjourned until ten oclock and
hazard will die at daybreak damn com-
stock

he telephone rang

  see who it is jim directed her-
rick

  beggs answered the phone yes he
said and covering the mouthpiece with his
hand whispered its gallatin

  the pompous idiot exploded herrick
tell him to go to blazes

by charles k van riper



   removing his hand beggs said suavely
 sorry senator the governor just left-i
 thought i could catch him-yes we heard
 the result good night

   the infernal fool stormed the gov-
 ernor that mans ruined ninety-nine per
 cent of the effect the fowler bill possessed
 the only feature that made it more than a
 comparatively unimportant measure the
 reform party being big enough to forget
 its bitterness at the loss of a leader was a
 thing to be respected the reform party
 swallowing the camel and straining at the
 gnat doing away with capital punishment
 but letting hazard go to his death will be
 open to the old charges of petty methods
 and narrow-mindedness

   cant you hold up the execution
 asked beggs the lights were paling before
 the lifting of the black pall beyond the
 window

   you know i cant retorted the gov-
 ernor testily the mans guilty without
 a doubt he has been convicted by the
 courts and sentence passed upon him in a
 proper manner i cant usurp the power
 of the courts the only power i can exer-
 cise is in an emergency and theres no
 emergency-no emergency except party
 expediency i have no feeling in the case
 personally but it was a golden oppor-
 tunity as for public emergency how-
 ever there is none hazard isnt being
 wronged by society he will die at day-
 break and no one will be the worse for it

   not even him poor devil beggs
 agreed

   poor templeton murmured herrick
 moving toward the window and gazing
 over the city just beginning to take shape
 in the darkness surveying the faint stars
 he remarked that storm seems to have
 gone around us the secretary going to
 the door paused and nodded anything
 more just now governor he asked

   no replied herrick without looking
 around for some time after the door
 closed behind beggs he remained at the
 window lost in thought he had just

	turned away and was ruefully viewing the
 wrecked eyeglasses when beggs again en-
 tered the governor looked up expectantly

   theres a woman to see you- beggs
 began

    i cant see her now objected the gov-
 ernor i suppose its the woman who
 fainted in the gallery cant see her
 jim he gathered up his hat and coat
 im on my way home
 hie man who knew

lie moved toward the door of the pri-

	 vate hall and his hand was on the
knob when the door across the office
opened and a woman dressed in dark gray
emerged from the ante-room

  governor herrick the voice was
hushed breathless

  ah-er- stammered the governor
as the woman quickly crossed the room
she was veiled and in her hand was a small
black book

  may i speak to you about- faltered
the woman then nodded nervously toward
beggs and appealed to the governor
may i talk to you alone it had grown
considerably lighter beyond the windows
governor herrick reluctantly closed the
door through which he hoped to escape
this interview hesitated and depositing his
hat and coat on a chair bade the visitor
be seated and nodded for beggs to with-
draw

  as the secretary left the room the gov-
ernor sat down at his desk swinging his
chair so he faced the woman and sug-
gested please be as brief as possible

  in answer the veil was lifted and the
governor starting in surprise exclaimed
miss willis no one who had ever seen
those gray-green eyes could mistake them

  i wasnt sure youd remember me-
began catherine

  indeed i do the governor assured her
heartily dont think i can ever forget
the work you did for me in the election
and only in the last few months in bring-
ing public sentiment behind the movement
to do away with the death-penalty

  theres something-very important
faltered catherine that i want to ask you
about-about the hazard case

  yes agreed the governor

  hes to be electrocuted this morning
  at daybreak

  catherine glanced toward the windows
shuddered the east was brightening
nothing has happened to delay the-the
- she stammered

  nothing said the governor if the
fowler bill had passed-

  but it didnt  cried catherine i was
out there there is no other way
governor herrick shook his head
hazard is a doomed man

catherine rose to her feet he
 cant die she protested vehemently
its wrong

  miss willis said the governor ris-

the blue



ing youve done wonderful work for the
cause he placed his hands on her shoul-
ders but dont let your nerves get the
better of you weve had a set-back but
in the end were bound to win

  he cant die cried catherine cant
i tell you

  theres no way to prevent it the
governor told her and we must admit
miss willis that if ever anyone deserved
to pay the extreme price it is hazard

  catherine drew away from him thats
not so she flamed

  the governor shrugged his shoulders
well he said and from his expression
it was easy to see he wished himself out of
the interview

  he cant die insisted catherine

  miss willis listen- began the gov-
ernor rather impatiently

  listen to me she cried flaring up
hazard is innocent 

  innocent gasped the governor

  yes innocent she rushed on tem-
pleton killed himself

  why-ah- the governor was stag-
gered

   he killed himself i tell you insisted
catherine

  how do you know demanded her-
rick

  its here in this book she declared
thrusting the black-bound volume toward
him to support her words herrick made
no attempt to take it if this is so- he
began

  it is so insisted catherine i knew
it twelve hours after templeton was shot

  then why the governor was aghast

  thatsit why-why wailed cath-
erine why have i waited its because
ive been a coward i hoped hazard would
be cleared in the courts then there was
the hope of the death-penalty being wiped
out i saw that from the first and worked
for your election worked and prayed and
loathed myself when hazard was con-
victed i should have spoken but i was
afraid-a coward i told myself it would
all come out right in the end and i
worked harder to take the electric chair
out of our prisons when i saw how things
were being delayed i should have spoken
but i was afraid-fool-afraid i saw
the danger of delay but the other way-i
was afraid to speak why why did he give
me the secret the power of his life over an-
other man it was like him like temple-
book magazine	by charles k van riper



ton i hated him i told him so told
him it was hopeless that everything was
ended    but he persisted   
it wasnt enough that he made a woman
of me when i still should have been a girl
   he dragged me into this 

  you mean- faltered the governor in
disbelief

  i mean that when i was young ran-
dolph templeton- gasped catherine
there was a night-

  you loved templeton asked herrick
  loved him no i was a fool

  but what im trying to get at-

  i was eighteen catherine went on
disregarding him the family was in
california i met templeton there he
was older than i perhaps eight years
older

  it was a love-affair asked herrick

hy must it always be love with
women demanded catherine
youve given us the vote you deal with us
in business but youre blind women arent
marble-arent even clay theyre flesh
and blood and breath i was that when
with randolph templeton it was mad-
ness the madness of music pagan wildness
midnight we were dancing he whis-
kered something about running away in
the motor the ride through the rushing
wind on one side dark pines and dim
mountains on the other the dunes in the
starlight the open sea rocks rising from
white water    my senses were drunk
with it all and templeton-

  catherine tossed her head it just hap-
pened to be templeton

  and after the governor pursued
he begged me to marry him but i
didnt want to at eighteen i wasnt sure
i wanted to marry anyone and i certainly
didnt want to marry him as for what
happened-i dont believe i ever would
have regretted it-it seemed so much like
a dream but he templeton persisted in
reminding me of it by eternally dunning
me to marry him then i met dean haz-
ard catherine paused

  i loved him she continued softly
perhaps i- then one night that strange
power of his-i was afraid afraid he could
see into my thoughts turn back the pages
of my mind to that night-the affair with
templeton i wanted dean-oh how
much i wanted him but i was proud
and i was afraid i told him i never
wanted to see him again told him that

night more than four years ago and he
went away you must save him

  with that despairing cry catherine
fumbled with the leaves of the black book
ive told you all this she said so you-
this is templetons book he too was
afraid of hazard she pressed the book
into the governors hands read and
see

  but- herrick began to protest
peering blindly at the book

  it was brought to me by templetons
old colored man said catherine the
darky who came north with templetons
mother from the randolph place in vir-
ginia he said that his master had told
him that if anything happened he was to
at once bring it to me read it

  but i cant objected the governor
my glasses-

  catherine snatched the book from his
hands breathlessly explaining the
things a diary kept apparently to prove
he had been faithful to me he never
could understand it was hopeless this is
the important part it begins about the
middle of september she read

   today i saw dean hazard i under-
stand that he has strong telepathic powers
can read thoughts only such a man as
he could get our secret from me it will
never pass my lips catherine passed on
down the page and resumed then on
another day he writes the thought of
hazard fascinates me what a power the
man has 

  and again said catherine and read
i saw hazard again today he was with
young hale you remember catherine
reminded the governor my brother-in-
law testified to having a stock-transaction
with hazard about two weeks before tem-
pleton was killed the date in the diary
corresponds to that

  from that point on she explained
the diary is filled with talk of hazard
first templetons speculations then his
fears he writes what if hale was plan-
ning with hazard to corner me and get our
secret it would be a tremendous scandal
its the only place they touch me polit-
ically or personally you see his interest
wasnt wholly unselfish catherines
trembling finger traced down the page then
stopped

  heres another place she continued
 hazard has become an obsession with
me what if the man should try he
could move like a ghost through the secret
the man who knew

the blue

gardens of my thoughts that was writ-
ten a week before templeton died then
this the following day there is a way
i have found it

  now listen cried catherine two
days before templeton was shot he wrote
this the thing that might destroy us
both can never happen let hazard come
i am ready it will mean death but the
other way it would be disgrace and defeat
-disgrace for you and disgrace and de-
feat for me today i procured a revolver
from my storeroom it is with me now
let hazard come we are safe death
is a seal he cannot break 

  the day before the shooting cath-
erine rushed on he wrote i would rather
die than be broken if anything happens
to me this record will be delivered to you
you will know that my part of the secret
died with me that it is yours and yours
alone catherine faced the governor
is that enough she demanded

ljerrick started as if roused from a
daze enough he shouted great
god yes

  then do something cried catherine
save him

  jim-jim cried the governor surg-
ing toward the door catherine was walk-
ing the floor moaning beggs burst into
the doorway

  get the prison on the phone shouted
herrick and the secretary dodging back
into the anteroom caught up the exten-
sion on his own desk the governor pac-
ing the room drew out his own watch not
more than two minutes at most he
groaned

  the wardens office sing sing beggs
was calling into the phone

  what-what hour was set asked
catherine huskily

  the governor paused custom he
said makes it daybreak

  catherine stood horror-stricken before
the window a faint flush was creeping up
in the east

  ive got them governor shouted
beggs from the other room your phone
is switched in herrick rushed to his
desk and sliding into his chair snatched
up the phone

  hello-hello he snapped catherine
had stumbled to the desk and bent over
it with her hands gripping the edge

  hello-hello gasped the governor
then burst out somethings wrong jim



  i had the connection explained beggs
rushing into the office and as he reached
the desk the governor gave over jigglitg
the hook and muttering hello to ex-
plode theres no one there now
beggs took the phone hello he
said hello    operator   
but we had the connection

  catherine and the governor hung over
him tensely there was a period of silence

  oh said beggs then turned to ex-
plain she says the connection went out
just after she got it the wire chief at
peekskill reports that the wires are down
between there and the prison theres a
heavy storm down the river

  catherine trembled in terror and slowly
turned to the awful fascination of the win-
dows in the east was the orange haze
of the spreading dawn hands brought
quickly to her face stifled a scream and
she sank to her knees sobbing

chapter xi

when the wires failed

in the wardens office at sing sing the
assistant ludlow sat at his superiors
desk complacently puffing a cigar
outside there was the blaze of lightning
and crash of thunder but ludlow was not
disturbed the cigar was a good one

  as the assistant was removing the cigar-
band which he slipped on his little finger
keeper blodgett entered with the an-
nouncement well theyve taken him in
yeh ludlow studied the flowing
feather of blue smoke that rose from his
cigar

  and i for one said blodgett settling
in a chair was glad to see him pass
through that door he just gave the chap-
lain and me the worst quarter of an hour
ive ever had

  uh-huh this time ludlows atten-
tion was fixed on a possible break in the
wrapper

  he insisted that people were talking
about him continued the keeper said
one was governor herrick and the other
a woman-couldnt say at all who the
woman was sometimes he would be clear
and then again all muddled up maybe it
was some of his mind-reading business but
to me-well i think he just broke down
under it and went crazy-stark mad i call
it blodgett not by nature exactly a
nervous man shivered and added well
book magazine

it will soon be over i see the skipper is
true to tradition there was a heavy
crash of thunder

  yes hes over in the village drawled
ludlow i notify him when its over and
he notifies the governor

  its a great life for you assistant war-
dens sighed blodgett

  not bad admitted ludlow and open-
ing a drawer of the desk lifted a box of
cigars from it the telephone rang

  the assistant glanced balefully at the
instrument on the desk and tendered the
cigars to blodgett with a casual have
one

  word about the fowler bill asked
the keeper as he rose and helped himself
from the extended box of cigars with a
glance at the ringing phone

  thats all settled replied ludlow
the clerks office called up ten minutes
ago to tell us it had been beaten by an
adjournment he closed down the lid
on the cigars the bell kept up its tattoo
hold your horses growled ludlow as
he replaced the cigars in the desk

  one of the chiefs asked the keeper
over the noise of the telephone bell as he
appraised the cigar

  with my compliments laughed lud-
low pushing the drawer shut leisurely
he leaned over and drew the phone toward
him as the ringing died away now
then he wheezed and lifted the receiver
in a bored way hello  yes the war-
dens office    hello    hello
there was a booming roar of thunder so
loud that blodgett lighting a match
jumped so that the flame was jerked out
heh drop that phone he shouted

  jiggling the hook ludlow looked across
at him in a deprecating way thats bunk
about getting a shock from a telephone in
a thunderstorm he declared hello   
hello    the damn things gone dead
he disgustedly hung up the receiver

  that was a whang-dinger of a crash
observed blodgett out of the corner of his
mouth qot occupied by the cigar it hit
pretty close bet thats whats the matter
with the phone

  i wonder who it was mused ludlow
then dismissing the question as he flicked
the ash from his cigar he remarked
these are good smokes arent they

  at that blodgett discovered that his
cigar was dry forgot tp light mine he
confessed that man hazard has got me
all on edge there was another crash of

by charles k van riper



thunder as he set to work to make good
the oversight the telephone rang again

  keep away from it warned blodgett

  shucks scoffed ludlow and picked
up the phone hello he said yes
   say did you try to get me before
   you didnt eh    all right what
is it yes    yes    hes in
there now    no hazard isnt dead
yet will be in a minute or so    yes
there was a crash of thunder a little
storm sure its all right hes as good
as dead    two or three minutes last
words how do i know i dont have my
office in the death-chamber    yes i
heard about it forced an adjournment
   uh-huh no i dont mind telling
him if i can reacjhim    dont men-
tion it he hung up

  it was the world the assistant in-
formed blodgett they asked if id let
their man know about the fowler bills be-
ing beaten are you acquainted with him
-little chap with sandy hair    see if
you can reach him a clap of thunder
seemed to shake the solid stone of the
prison

  yeh said blodgett rising and moving
toward the door

  tell him instructed the assistant war-
den that the radicals jammed through a
motion for adjournment before they could
get a vote the chief will be wild when he
hears it

dlodgett in passing through the door
all but collided with the chaplain rush-
ing up out of breath fairfield brushed
psst without paying any attention to blod-
gett who continued on his way the chap-
lain dashed up to the desk and demanded
excitedly have you had a telephone-
call

  well-er- began ludlow

  a message from albany continued
fairfield

  no drawled ludlow

  well hazard says burst out the chap-
lain that governor herrick is trying to
stay the execution

  hes crazy sneered the assistant

  i dont think so asserted fairfield
you havent called on the telephone
the new york world just rang up
yawned ludlow

  and that was all demanded the chap-
lain say ludlow you wouldnt think
this man was crazy if you seen him stand-
ing there in the death-chamber as if his
the man who knew

eyes were seeing just what he was talking
about there was no other call an-
other bursting crash of thunder roared
through the room

  yes there was another call admitted
ludlow with a frown i dont know who
it was from they asked if this was the
wardens bffice

  and then were cut off gasped the
chaplain breathlessly

  ludlow looked at him in alarm how
did you know

  thats it cried fairfield thats
just what hazard described the gov-
ernor trying and the phone-connection
broken

  ludlow lurched to his feet the devil
you say he exploded

  its just what he said happened cried
the chaplain what can we do
nothing replied ludlow
something-anything gasped fair-
field weve got to save him i believe
the mans right 

  but theres nothing to be done ob-
jected the assistant glowering at the win-
dow beyond which lightning crackled a
prelude to tremendous thunder

  theyre strapping him into the chair
pleaded the chaplain

  i cant accept his statement expostu-
lated ludlow i cant take his word for
it that the governor is trying to get us
not on your life

  but look how it fits into the facts
argued fairfield he couldnt have known
that there was a phone-call to the prison in
which the connection was broken i be-
lieve hes right i tell you

  this mind-reading business is too
flimsy protested ludlow with an impa-
tient gesture no one ever heard of such
a thing

  thats no sign it cant be declared
the chaplain in ringing conviction

  but in my place growled the assist-
ant what can i do

  stop it cried fairfield im con-
vinced the man has strange powers and
standing in the shadow of death those
powers might be intensified to an astound-
ing degree

  t wish- muttered the assistant tug-
ging at his watch

there was a blinding sizzling flash in
the room an illusion of a whirling blue
core of light darting in a jagged course
then a tidal wave of angry sound came

the blue



crashing down as if the rock-walled prison
itself were tumbling in the chaplains
lips were moving in prayer silenced by
the stupendous thunderstroke they were
supplicating save him save him
ludlow frowned at his watch sniffing at
the pungent after-odor of lightning as order
emerged out of the mad maelstrom of noise
no use chaplain said the assistant
without looking up from his watch for a
moment chaplain fairfield studied fear-
fully the others expression then echoed
faintly no use-

  the assistant warden shook his head
whispering the current was turned on
more than a minute ago the chaplains
chin sank to the black broadcloth that
curved over his chest ludlow returned
his watch mechanically and scowled at his
cigar the ringing of the telephone made
the assistant shudder faifield did not
even glance up standing with closed eyes
and drawing deep uneven breaths as lud-
low lifted the receiver

  yes said the assistant into the phone
then ejaculated the governor the
chaplain looked up quickly horrified
there was the boom and crash of thunder

  its too late your excellency said
ludlow leadenly hazard is dead
fairfield quivered the irony of it
the utter tragedy of salvation came too
late and hazard had known had gone
to his death knowing that it had been de-
creed that he should not die had given
up his life because the jailers to whom he
had been delivered could not comprehend
powers greater than their own powers that
after all were so pitifully small they
had not understood had refused to put
faith in the thing that was new beyond
their own petty understanding he was
right the chaplain whispered huskily

  yes sir ludlow was saying the
phone rang and some one asked if this was

the wardens officethen the phone

connection was broken what followed
the assistant repeated so fairfield could
hear you got us by roundabout wire to

new york and then up the river

it is a tragedy

  keeper blodgett burst through the door
crying in a fanatical voice it wasnt
meant to happen thats all

  what demanded the chaplain while
ludlow his eyes on the keeper said into
the phone just a minute governor
then he asked whats wrong blod-
gett
book magazine

  its all off exclaimed blodgett
scarcely coherent in his excitement

  what is snapped ludlow

  lightning gasped blodgett waving
his arms wildly hit the power plant
there was a dull smashing of thunder

  and hazard cried the chaplain

  alive as ever the keeper shouted
the chair was harmless as a cradle

  thank god breathed the chaplain

  and hes happy as a boy blurted
blodgett says the governor is talking
over the prison phone now

  the assistant warden swayed in his chair
and with awe-stricken eyes stared at the
telephone he was holding

chapter xii

marigolds

rthe late sun of an april afternoon was
streaming in the long french windows
of the willis living-room warming the rich
red luster of the piano touching the curve
of a shallow bronze bowl with inlaid silver
tracery on the center-table and bathing
the pages of a magazine that held the at-
tention of bob hale he paused in turn-
ing a page lowered the magazine and
looked around as nan came into the room

  dean should be coming any minute
shouldnt he his wife asked

  hazard yes bob replied

  you know said nan although its
five years now and so much has happened
it seems the natural thing to call him
dean

  where is catherine bob asked

  my dear shes actually fussing up
exclaimed nan enthusiastically i havent
ever seen her so excited

  fine bob declared

  you should see her bob she looks
simply wonderful

  runs in the family asserted bob
gazing in admiration at the picture his
wife made in her dress of white net and
the filmy scarf of chinese blue thrown over
her shoulders and touching the black love-
liness of her hair nan rewarded him by
leaving her seat and settling on the arm of
his chair running her hands through his
hair i was always fond of dean she
said i wish we could go back to that
night we all were here and have things
happen differently

  why that was the night i proposed
objected bob

by charles k van riper

  one of the nights corrected nan it
was the night i was willing

  the night you admitted it bob teased
her

  what i meant said nan seriously
was that things had turned out differently
for catherine and dean i knew even
then that she liked him better than any
other man she had ever known she must
have had to fight to keep from showing
it ive another surprise for her

  what bob asked the question the
pause invited

  marigolds announced nan for that
bowl on the table i must get them

  she hasnt had any marigolds bob re-
flected since the night templeton- you
know my testimony that the flower must
have fallen from my coat and he must
have reclaimed it from the floor

  yes

  i perjured myself he said he
begged me to give it to him begged because
it was catherines flower i wanted to
keep catherines name out of the business
    strange isnt it after what hap-
pened

  and dean told the same story you
did added nan you dont think he
suspected

  he says not bob replied says he
never knew until just before the re-trial
with the new evidence in speaking of it
he reminded me that at the very first here
in the house that night he couldnt tell the
cards she was holding he never knew the
name templeton was keeping back even
at the last he couldnt identify her as the
woman who was talking to the governor
it was some freak of his mind dean told
me that night in the club that it was be-
cause in the case of catherine his heart
was stronger than his head his emotions
more powerful than his mind

  do you really think- faltered nan
can dean read thoughts any more

  its a question admitted bob the
doctors have had him for two weeks-from
the time of the acquittal

  they were so confident in their first re-
port sighed nan

  and it seemed plausible too agreed
bob the reaction from the shock of the
experience might easily have destroyed
the telepathic susceptibility of his mind
think of being strapped in the death-
chair said nan in a subdued voice the
switch actually being thrown-and yet es-
caping
the man who knew

  sitting there with the death-cap over
his head added bob and reading the
thoughts of a man more than one hundred
miles away but then the governors
concentration was intense and deans
mental receptivity must have been tre-
mendous

  its quite a commentary on our pride
of achievement declared nan the
telephone crippled by a broken wire the
prison wireless useless with the power-
plant out of commission and yet a mes-
sage being transmitted with the equipment
given the first man

  i wonder how catherine will be
mused bob

  nan did not reply and when after an
interval she spoke it was to remark
wasnt it odd that to the very last dean
couldnt identify her as the woman in the
case

  at least said bob theres one per-
son who can be comfortable while hes
around-one whose thoughts he cant
read

  s-s-s-h- cautioned nan shes com-
ing

  youre glorious was bobs tribute as
catherine appeared in a soft trailing
dress of deep amethyst

  im glad said catherine quietly go-
ing over to the table and looking down at
the empty bronze bowl the golden flecks
danced in the gray-green of her eyes as
she faced the others and exclaimed im
really happy then as she sat down
asked bob how was dean looking
when you saw him

  surprisingly well said bob as nan
careful not to let catherine see noiselessly
lifted the bowl from the table and went out
of course bob was saying hes aged
considerably

  how much hes been through cath-
erine broke in

  a motor stopped in front of the house

  its dean exclaimed catherine ris-
ing bob was beside her and together
they went to the door hazard was com-
ing up the veranda steps as they opened it

  catherine he cried

  dean she said chokily as their hands
touched

  bob greeted dean heartily then with
an excuse vanished

  youre wonderful breathed hazard
as he led her to a chair and dropped to

by charles k van riper



one knee by her side then he reached
into an inner pocket and drew out two
bits of cardboard fastened face to face
with elastics he dropped it to her lap
deftly twisted off the taut bands and lifted
the upper cardboard beneath it was the
pressed dry marigold you see this
flower he began

  i know catherine checked him
kept it always he said its brown
withered but  perhaps there may be
more marigolds-fresh marigolds he
lifted the faded flower to the table and
catching her other hand breathed cath-
erine dearest do you love me

  yes she said simply and so absorbed
were they in each other that they did not
see nan come in with a bowl brimming
with marigolds she was about to set it
down on the table when she saw the pa-
thetic pressed flower nan knew its story
gently replacing the fragile talisman be-
tween the cardboards she covered it with
the bowlful of fresh flowers

  catherine the doctors tell me that
theres a chance for freedom from this
thing-that if i fight it i may win

  i know a place in the north woods
he went on his eyes narrowing as if they
looked out on it a place in canada north
of quebec a days ride by stage at the
end of the railroad another day in the sad-
dle due north and there near the head
of the valley is a camp a big comfortable
camp just beyond to the north the val-
ley is closed by a sheer forest wall the
beginning of the big timber that stretches
to the tundras there i can get away
from things people-a few half-savage na-
tives thats all its a big country a wild
country and there one must be strong or
perish im going there catherine to fight
it out-alone

  alone she whispered he looked at
her in dazed uncertainty for a moment
then his arms were around her his lips
on hers one of her hands against his
cheek after that kiss she rested her
head on his shoulder it was as she lifted
it again she saw the flowers nan had put
on the table her eyes went wide with
wonder she gasped marigolds
hazard turned his head and in each
others arms they stood looking at the
goldan garden of hope that glowed where
they had left the frail brown flower of
memory

couldnt do anything in particular all i could hope for was just a job -
and thats what i got at  a month for routine unskilled work i
stayed at it for three years with one small increase each year

  then one day i woke up i found i wasnt getting ahead simply because i couldnt
do any one thing well i decided right then to put in an hour after supper each night
preparing myself for more important work so i wrote to scranton and arranged for
a course that would give me special training for our business

  why in a few months i had a whole new vision of my work and its possibilities you
see i was just beginning to really understand it i made some suggestions to the man-
ager and he was immensely pleased said
he had noticed how much better i was do-
ing lately and wished he had more like me

  just after that an opening came and he
gave me my chance - at an increase of 
a month then i really began to grow

six months later i was put in charge of my
department and my salary went up again

since then ive had two increases of  a
month and now ive got another  raise  

for  years the international corre-
spondence schools have been helping men
and women everywhere to win promotion
to earn more money to have happy pros-
perous homes to know the joy of getting
ahead in business and in life

plete but simplified high school course in two years giving

 now brush teeth

 in the new way-remove the film

all statements approved by high dental authorities

   try this new way of teeth
cleaning the test is free
it has brought to millions
whiter safer teeth leading
dentists everywhere advise it

   see the results then learn
what they mean to you

   what ruins teeth

teeth are ruined by a film

you can feel it-that viscous

coat it clings to teeth gets
between the teeth and stays
and most tooth troubles are
now traced to it

   it is this film-coat that dis-
 colors-not the teeth film

 is the basis of tartar it holds
 food substance which ferments
 and forms acid it holds the
 acid in contact with the teeth
 to cause decay

  millions of germs breed in
 it they with tartar are the
 chief cause of pyorrhea

  brushed in the usual way
 much of that film is left and
 very few people have escaped
 the troubles that it causes

now we combat it

  dental science has in late
years found a way to fight
film day by day high au-
thorities have proved it by
many careful tests

 millions of people have
adopted it largely by dental
advice to careful people it
is bringing a new era in teeth
cleaning

 these new methods are all
embodied in a dentifrice called
pepsodent and you are urged
to prove it by a pleasant ten-
day test

five important effects

  pepsodent has five effects all
of them essential to cleaner
safer teeth one ingredient is
pepsin one multiplies the
starch digestant in the saliva
to combat starch deposits that
cling one multiplies the
alkalinity of the saliva to
neutralize mouth acids

  in two ways it attacks the
film directly then it keeps
the teeth so highly polished
that film cannot easily cling

  it differs vastly from the old-
time tooth pastes which den-
tists now know were wrong

 send the coupon for a -
day tube note how clean
the teeth feel after using mark
the absence of the viscous film
see how teeth whiten as the
film-coat disappears

  within a week you will know
that your teeth are protected
as they never were before
and you will always want
your teeth to look and feel like
