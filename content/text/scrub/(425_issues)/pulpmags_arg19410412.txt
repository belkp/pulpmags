destroyer

by steve fisher

author of goodbye hawaii pigboat guy etc

does america face invasion what would be the strategy of the invaders-and the strat-
egy of our defense these are huge questions in the minds of everyone and here are their
answers in a dramatic and deeply moving story of two brave men and a spirited girl who
live in the tomorrow we pray will never come

chapter i

war in the spring

  it snowed in new york that winter and the snow
  flakes fat and shapeless fell in a white curtain against
  the lights of the city there were dance bands just
   as there always are and new musical comedies and fine
  plays a pulitzer prize was awarded and there was the
  theatre guild and william saroyan and walter winchell
  

  there was a kidnaping on the west coast a cold wave
in the north and a flood in the south there were new
pictures from hollywood and news bulletins from abroad
came every few hours there was always news one move
or another there were rumors and conferences panic and
famine the commentators came on the radio and told you
all about it they were still going on after all these
months and of course there was much talk about canada

  all over the united states young men from the cities
the towns and the farms were being trained under arms

-argosy-april -
destroyer



the ship yards were busy there was the clanking of
steel the hoarse thunder of a thousand buzzing rivet
drills airplane factories were jammed with orders four
years in advance and one after another new army bombers
came off the assembly line

  japan was running the orient we recalled our citizens
from the far east there was a statement issued by the
united states department of war that was the next
thing to a direct ultimatum the american fleet was in
singapore at the time but japan protected by the axis
powers ignored it and nothing was done we did not
declare war people talked there were peace moves there
were radio forums where you heard fine speeches and gaudy
patriotism flaunted freely but no guns went off

  a month later a south american republic declared itself
in line with the axis powers and germany and italy moved
warships and troop transports it was rumored to the
coast of that country

  there were scathing editorials in all the newspapers
and the president spoke to the nation and used phrases
like perilous situation and we are prepared there
was a peace rally in madison square garden which ended
in a riot and the deaths of two new york policemen who
were trying to keep order a congressional committee
reported sabotage in sevep different american gasoline
refineries and the price jf first-grade gasoline went up to
forty cents a gallon and later to forty-three cents

  then simultaneously germany seized dutch guiana
and japan made threatening overtures in the philippines

  the united states immediately mobilized

  but only a small percentage of the new naval craft under
constructiqn had been completed the air force of the
combinedenemy powers outnumbered american planes at
a ratio of six to one in total naval tonnage the ratio was
slightly leis

  they had fifteen large tanks to every one of ours four
million americans were in uniform but still there was no
war there was appeasement talk which was not popular
spain wanted a portion of louisiana mexico wanted a
hundred square miles of texas then silent until now
russia suddenly landed troops and planes in alaska and
ran up the communist flag the united states stood alone
against the world

  another three million americans mobilized bringing
the total fighting forces to seven million

  people did not sleep well at night anti-aircraft guns
were being constructed on tall buildings there was a
slump on wall street the value of gold went down
business firms failed banks stayed open only by govern-
ment order ten thousand people who were loud-voiced
patriots in peacetime fled for the canadian border but
among the civilians who were left were new alien faces
which had appeared mysteriously from nowhere

  wherever you looked there were soldiers and parades
with bands and tanks and artillery and squadrons of
new planes roared overhead day and night dance bands
still played young women wept and now in march there
was no more talk of peace

tn early march the pacific was green bright and
hot with the sun flecked white with froth for two
days there was a storm off the gulf stream but after
that it was calm again and there were very many flying
fish which made small flashes of silver lightning across
the jade surface

  from the submarines you saw these fish all the time and
quite often they flew right up on deck here they flopped
grotesquely on the black lattice-work growing gradually
weaker until at last they were dead the tropic sun rotted
them very quickly and twice a day sailors had to climb
down from the conning tower and gather the putrid winged-
fish and throw them over the side

  the submarines were old and small and the trip was
grueling for the men and hard on the engines so that there
were only four underwater dives during those entire twenty-
two days the remainder of the time they stayed on the
surface following the uss holland a big auxiliary ship
which was the tender

  there were fourteen of the submarines and they fol-
lowed the tender like gray cigar-shaped suckling pigs
it would have been easy for a plane to spot them but they
kept a close watch and no planes were sighted

  the submarines were s-boatsnot fleet craft at all the
new v-type moved with the fleet and were quite fast and
very big in the s-boats there were four torpedo tubeis
forward and one aft all of the torpedoes had been fitted
with war-heads and were in readiness for any eventuality
the s-boats top speed was twelve knots only five sub-
merged for a number of years they had been based at
pearl harbor where they cruised around maui molakai
and oahu in the patrol of the hawaiian islands i

  below-decks the ships were cramped and uncomfortable
they were outmoded pig-iron boats and they rattled and
wheezed with the pounding of the big diesel engines
there were air condensors in the compartments but never-
theless the air was foul and hot and stank of an acid that
ate your dungarees and made the skin on your arms and
your face itch and burn

  one of these old submarines was the s- which sank a
number of years ago with its entire crew and was later
brought up and reconditioned

  the submarines had sailed under sealed orders and a
strict radio silence was maintained in the pacific they
saw only two other ships-both of them freighters bound
for south america all fourteen of the submarines dove
and the freighters passed the uss holland dipped their
colors in salute to a man-o-war and continued peacefully
on their way unaware that a fleet of small submarines
lay beneath them

  the submarines had run short on all food and the men
now ate non-perishable cereals mixed with powdered
milk and hardtack and jam

  but when they reached panama they tied up and took
on fuel oil and fresh provisions a few hours later they
proceeded through the canal on the s- a man had died
of acute appendicitis and five others had been taken off the
uss holland stricken with fever and transferred to the
naval hospital

tn the caribbean it was cooler and there was rain and
 wind for three days they saw an occasional island
leafy and green and now and again an american cruiser
crawled across the horizon

  on the fifth day the fourth despatch of sealed orders
was opened six of the submarines immediately turned
back to colon for repairs and overhaul and the other eight
disunited and sailed singly to the longitudes assigned them
the holland moored off a former british base

  the captain on the s- said were part of a blockade
the iron net

  have you heard anything yet sir

  no but you neednt worry theyll inform us when
hostilities commence

   do you imagine itll be soon

   i imagine so but theres no way of telling captain
knight said the entire fleet is engaged in war maneu-
vers actually or figuratively we are at war at least
were taking positions against what must inevitably be a
naval attack

   then were going to wait for them to strike

   im afraid its necessary were outnumbered if we
sought them out its possible that we might fall into a trap
-leaving our coast vulnerable to attack half their forces
might bottle us up somewhere no were the defenders
with our backs to the wall we can do nothing but stick
at our posts and wait for them

   and have we any chance for a quick victory

  im afraid not captain knight said bluntly our
fleet is small many of the ships are old moreover half
our main-line units are in guam ready to strike at japan
therell be a major sea battle out there in the pacific worse
than anything that took place at jutland but the japanese
are notably rotten marksmen andjt may be that our pacific
fleet will annihilate them

   i hope so

   this ill say-tokyoll be bombed before los angeles
or san francisco but nothing that happens in the pacific
will affect us its like a separate war

   were here on the atlantic and our reduced forces face
the biggest enemy fleet in the history of the world not
only the navies of germany and italy but the best large
ships of several other navies-captured ships now manned
by german seamen

  all heavy

  yes and god knows how many destroyers and sub-
marines they have aircraft i wont even discuss they
have almost more planes than men hundreds of munition
factories are turning out bombs for them there is nothing
exaggerated about this if anything i underestimate
what is our job

   the iron net the s-boats will do what they can but
its like setting bear traps to catch a herd of elephants
we know that sooner or later the enemy will invade these
waters we will lie directly in the path between the enemy
flotilla and our own main atlantic fleet

   well lie between them sir

hthe captain nodded it is perfectly simple you under-
stand war maneuvers in operations on land there are
various lines of defense-first second and third

   last is the main line which in this case is our atlantic
squadrons battleships and heavy cruisers on land the
first line of defense is the weakest usually consisting of
machine-gun placements french s anti-aircraft and
anti-tank guns the attacking force as in the case of
france runs through this line-annihilates it in such
a defense there can be no opportunity for retreat

  the attackers now meet the second line of defense
this is made up of heavier gun emplacements tank traps
defense tanks barbwire and all manner of equipment

   the attacking spearhead penetrates this although now
the opponent hopes somewhat weakened-and finally
hits the main line of defense here ordinarily a tremen-
dous battle occurs the main line of defense is heavy
artillery and the full fighting forces of the opponents

  the unscathed right and left flanks of the first and
second defense lines are now supposed to close in on the
rear of the enemy spearhead the whole thing is beauti-
ful its gorgeous-on paper this was the celebrated
weygand defense

  i lost a months pay in wagers on the fall of paris
because i was sure that such a system and basically it
is sound with a few improvements weve borrowed it in
essence for naval defense couldnt be defeated but they
were defeated-miserably

  to what do you attribute it sir

  the enemy had superior over-powering force it is
exactly the same thing were up against

  i see

  have you ever been in swimming and stung by
nettles

  yes certainly

  well we are the nettles the enemy fleet will enter
these waters ready to engage our own fleet in battle but
to reach them they must pass us we fourteen s-boats
will go into action well torpedo as many of their capital
ships as we possibly can

  hundreds of fighter planes and bombers will swarm
out from nearby bases and give us a hand in the battle
theyll bomb and dive at the enemy but of course theyll
have to contend with enemy aircraft well have only one
element in our favor-a few seconds of surprise like net-
tles the submarines will sting and harass the enemy ships
with luck we may sink a few of them

  but to torpedo them well have to be at periscope
depth what about the anti-submarine fleet-thp destroy-
ers wont the enemy be protected by a convoy of themn
yes by hundreds of them the captains voice was
calm and because we have our own job to do we will
not be permitted to submerge to a safe depth until we
have fired all our fish and the tubes are empty we have
orders to ignore the destroyers

  but thatll be-suicide

  the captain smiled wryly the first line of defense is
always in that position war is worked out on charts it
is a game played with units although i am more than
certain that we shall not survive this action when it comes

i cannot but see and admire the strategy that placed us
here

  suicide fleet-

  yes there was a motion picture of that tiile once
rather mild i think and certainly it wasnt like this
this will be like nothing any of us have ever lived before
you see it had to be us dont you

  it couldnt have been the fine big v-type subs theyre
far too valuable to sacrifice in a preliminary show of this
sort i mean it i make the statement with no bitterness in
my heart if i were in the admiralty i only hope that i
should have had the acumen to arrange the same situation
we are fourteen creaky over-age tubs and this one action
is the only decent excuse there is for the expense weve been
to the government

  nobly expressed sir

  theres nothing noble about it i dont think any man
minds doing what he can for his country it takes no
heroism i doubt such a thing exists because war makes
you fatalistic you have your job to do and you can but
execute it as well as you know how

  perhaps the attack wont come for weeks

  it can be weeks days or hours

                             -argosy-april -

   and in the end sir we shall give an excellent account-
ing of ourselves

   i am certain of it the captain said

chapter ii

suicide fleet

rthat night after his conversation with the captain
jeff lay on his bunk in the darkness of the s-s ward-
room he did not know if he had actually slept but now
he opened his eyes and lay very still

   the hot filthy air stuck in his throat he was garbed
only in shorts but his body was sticky with sweat he
reflected on the captains words and yet even now the
war seemed removed from him

   reality is a hard thing to come by he was here on this
ship in the war zone and yet to his incredulous mind it
was more as if this were some grotesque play in which he
was a participant he was frightened that he knew no
fear and it occurred to him that this was because the
thick air had rendered him physically listless he per-
formed his duties with a mechanical lassitude which really
involved very little thought the long grind at sea had
worn him down

   jeffs consciousness had long ago been numbed by the
heavy ceaseless throb of the diesel engines pump   
pump    pump day and night until at last like a man
who lives beside a waterfall he no longer even heard it
instead at this moment he quite clearly heard the sound
of a violin jackie a machinist mate was in the torpedo
room playing it a violin on a submarine the only music
aboard jeff had still not lost his ironic taste for the
contrast that this offered the violin played poor
butterfly

   propaganda jeff said

   he flung out a long arm and groped in his locker for
a cigarette the wardroom was dark and very small
only strips of dirty canvas separated its bunks table and
locker space from the forward battery compartment where
the men slept

   at sea you did little more than eat sleep and stand
watch there was no shower on board so that you couldnt
bathe and if you shaved in cold water it was at your own
risk but the officers would shave they had to set an
example that only a few would follow all of them were
packed together below decks like sardines in a can

   jeff was a junior-lieutenant and there were three other
officers two junior-lieutenants and one senior the senior
was lieutenant knight and by virtue of being commanding
officer he was called captain jeff wiped the moisture
from his lips and put a cigarette in his mouth he lit up
puffed and at the same time stretched the muscles in his
legs	v

   im decayed he thought the damn acid is decaying
me

rphe s-s blunt bow rose in a rocking motion and fell

- it climbed to the peak of every land swell and de-
scended into every watery canyon jeff snapped on the
dim overhead light and rolled out of the upper bunk

   he hit the deck with a thud and stood there in his bare
feet his blond hair rumpled his sunburnt face mottled
the steel deck plates were hot and oily under his toes
he put on sandals and approached the tin wash basin

  there was half an inch of water in it and it was muddy
with twice-used soap but he knew the condensers had
been five times on the blink and a good officer didnt
waste fresh water he slapped what there was there over
his hot sweaty face it refreshed him a little he glanced
at the clock taped to a shelf  he had forty minutes
before he took the midnight watch he decided to shave

   i look like hell 

  the mirror was warped and steamy and he rubbed his
hand across it he was tall well-built and he leaned for-
ward peeling sunburnt flecks of skin from his nose

  when hed finished the shave he put on dungaree
trousers a clean undershirt and an old blue tunic which
he left unbuttoned he slapped a greasy officers cap on
his head and left the wardroom he moved through the
narrow companionway of the forward battery to the tor-
pedo room

  the bow of the boat sloped downward toward the shiny
discs of the torpedo tube doors and the machinist with
the violin stood crouched here playing he wore dungaree
trousers a tattered skivie shirt and straw goaheads from
honolulu he glanced up at jeff and kept playing

  long torpedoes were strapped to the bulkheads where
they lay in iron cradles they were slick with grease and
glistened dully the sailors sat around on bunks some
crouched on deck playing acey ducey they were all
listening to the violin six of the crew were civilians caught
in the draft but the long trip had moulded them so that
they were no longer green boots blit like everyone else
jackie finished playing now

  anything special youd like to hear sir

  no jeff said thanks ive got the mid to four i
wont be able to stay

  as he left the torpedo room he heard the violin again
and it sounded strangely he did not know why he entered
the cramped squarish control room the periscope was
secured in a steel stump in the middle of the deck an
escape hatch built in within the last few years took
up much of the precious room and against either bulkhead
the riveted overhead was so low that you had to duck jeff
climbed the ladder up through the air compression room
and into the conning tower

captain knight was here and lanny morris the
executive officer morris had the watch a coxswain
operated the small iron steering lever and a signalman

                             -argosy-april -

binoculars in his hands sat up on the oak rim of the cup-
like tower the night was hot and the stars in the sky
looked white and naked the moonlit sea was a rippling
purple

  good evening sir

  hello jeff the captain said he was a good-natured
thickset man he wore dungaree trousers and a blue tunic
weve just decoded a message from the division com-
mander its good news i believe he turned what
would you say mr morris wouldnt you say it was
good news

i would say it was damn good news mr morris said
vvere going in the captain announced he didnt
sound displeased unless theres an emergency well be
in for four or five days youll be able to go ashore
youve a friend in cristobal havent you

  yes sir nick waters the writer

  well tomorrow morning well be out of this zone by
that time you can radio him youll be in were officially
relieved from duty for a while and theres no necessity
for keeping a radio silence

   thatll be swell jeff said

  i thought youd like it ive read all of nick waters
books you know and i think hes very good im going
to let you and mr morris have leave-to freshen up
god knows we all need it and it may very well be that
this is the last shore leave any of usu get

  i hadnt thought of that mr morris said i daresay
i will once i get in cristobal

  the captain chuckled i imagine the two of youll raise
merry hell

  arent you going ashore sir jeff asked

  no the engineer and myself will have to stay aboard
and take care of the ship theyre going to give us an
overhaul job and its up to us to supervise

  but couldnt i take your place skipper i mean-
no-and dont worry this s-s old manll get over
for a glass of beer all right

  when captain knight and mr morris had gone below
jeff stood in the bridge and watched the dirty gray bow
of the submarine slowly rise and fall the captain had
written his instructions for the night and laid out the
course that would bring them in they would arrive in
colon about six tomorrow evening it was late now and
the breeze dried the sweat in jeffs dungarees

  jeff was glad about leave in colon he had very special
cause to be glad

  he began to think of nick waters nick wasnt in
panama without reason he was up to something and
whatever it was it would be dangerous that was the way
nick lived he had traveled abroad for years he was an
international figure hed been in madrid during the
spanish war and in paris when it fell he had been in
the last war also but jeff knew very little about that

  jeff had met him at the races in milan that summer the
middies were in europe thered been a party theyd
gone drinking and nick had taken an immense liking
to him

  once in a while two men meet who are bound to become
close friends it was like that both jeff and nick were
men of action they shared similar tastes and opinions
each could handle himself in a brawl among writers
nick was rated as one of the finest realists in literature
and jeff was flattered that nick a celebrity should like
him

  on the other hand the exploits of a submarine officer
intrigued nick and he never stopped asking questions
about undersea navigation the second time jeff saw him
was in honolulu and he had shown nick the town women
went crazy over nick and they had very good times but
it had been a year now since he had seen him and jeff
was anxious to renew the friendship

  he leaned on the rail of the conning tower and looked
off across the purple of the desolate ocean the diesels
were below-decks and up here he could scarcely hear them
the air was fresh and sweet and there was in the wind
the taste of the tropics

chapter iii

girl with the green eyes

cristobal was wet with rain and smelled wet the
wet smell of wood in frame buildings and the wet
sweet smell of grass in the parks and civic squares and
the whisper of tall giddy coco palms shaking themselves

  on the roof tops you could still hear them hammering
anti-aircraft guns into place in the streets there was the
sound of rivet-drills and there were huge piles of bricks
and dirt and mortar workmen were building air shel-
ters on the streets too there was the noise of bars the
marimba music and there were soldiers and sailors and
cheap women and white-clad tourists and dark-coated
alien refugees

  there were peddlers with gaudy shawls crying their
wares and busy black-skinned panamanians in cash
alley pale and sick young women chattered of invasion
and bombs they washed down peanuts with gin and
spoke of total destruction

  nick waters sat very still in his hotel room the shades
half drawn the windows rain-wet softly there came to
him the music of his radio a cigarette burned in an ash
tray to nick it seemed that the room was very quiet
it occurred to him that if he listened with all of his might
it was possible he would hear the laughter of his com-
rades in madrid and if he concentrated properly he could
sit again in the pom-pom the one on the champs elysees
gay french girls around him their yellow hair piled on
their heads kitten eyes bright and their striped silk
dresses tight on their bodies

  but then hed remember that day in may the goose-
stepping troops that swung through the place de con-
corde and finally around the arc de triumphe the tired
worn-out victory army of austrian and bavarian farm
boys and then when they had been sent to a new front
the steel gray-faced nazi army of occupation that moved
in upon the city

  he stirred none of these memories could matter now
in retrospect he could perceive that there was really very
little in his life that mattered-except kathie it must
have been that hed loved her ever since madrid and shed
disappeared

  he caught up with her a week later in barcelona but
she only laughed and months afterward in paris she
had taken all the information he had to offer for one of
her news-magazine articles and once the exclusive story
was on the cables she left him again

  he remembered racing alone in a taxi to gare st
lazare and then standing desolated on the platform be-
cause her train had already left always he pursued

                          -argosy-april -
destroyer



altvays she eluded him she gained whatever material she
wanted he had ways of discovering important informa-
tion now and then and then she vanished

he had tried hating her one night in a pub in london
he remembered it was a wet night and afterward
because he was drunk he got lost in the fog in trafalgar
square and he had stood clinging to a lamp post listen-
ing to the scream of an air-raid warning he had tried
hating her but it hadnt been any good he always
thought hed find her some day again and he always did
but that would only make it worse it would turn from
a pain of nostalgia into torture

   she meant no harm it wasnt her fault she didnt love
him it was true she got her news stories in devious ways
but she was absolutely independent he remembered
reading an article she wrote from finland there was a
picture of her in white ski togs and he had thought look-
ing at the picture that she was the prettiest girl alive

  sometimes it seemed incrediblte to him ego was his
stock in trade that he should be disappointed in love
nick waters he must have known a hundred women
and hed even loved some of them there was that nurse
in france-how many years ago had that been-hed
met in a ruined chateau the time he lay wounded with
shrapnel after the show in the somme but he realized
that katherine was unlike any of the others

  he glanced at his watch she was due to arrive in
cristobal tonight she had radioed him and he had
deliberately avoided meeting the boat she had been aware
of course of his feeling toward her but there was no point
in letting her know the condition was still acute

   at any rate he had an excuse to stay in his room and
here he had remained so that when she arrived op the
dock she would look around and not seeing him be dis-
appointed yet in his heart he realized she was too cos-
mopolitan to be upset by the smite of such a midget
revenge she had always been able to see through his
subterfuge and now she would only laughand think him
infantile for being so peevish

  no matter how complex a web of intrigue he wove
to trap kathie it was always himself who in the end
became helplessly entangled

  he glanced around the room the wall paper was
faded and the ceiling was low tacked on one wall there
was a huge map of panama showing both the pacific
and atlantic sides extending as far as haiti martinique
was outlined in red crayon as were several other islands
in and through the west indies

   ah of the bases acquired from the british were circled
with blue there were special penciled notations around
st thomas guayama barahona and port-au-prince on
an opposite wall was a huge map of the eastern sea coast
of the united states showing portions of mexico

   there was a table near the front windows and on this
was nicks portable typewriter and several pads of paper
i do everything in long hand and revise it on typewriter
he explained to people there was a pile of old maps and
several dusty tomes on the table

   nick was a linguist he played a dangerous and usually
profitless game against the wars of the world profitless
because his only gain was an occasional short story of
some experience or other novels were more difficult and
he didnt often write them it was a lonely life he was
so constituted that he could not live without excitement

  and he went from war to war like a weary soldier of
  fortune

  its funny i havent been killed he thought

  there was a knock on the door he jumped he was
  ashamed of the wild excitement that surged through him
  then he opened the door and he was staring at kathie
  his tight creased face broke into a grin

  hello baby

  she was refreshingly young and beautifully radiant
  her reddish hair came to her shoulders and her eyes
  were green her lips dark crimson she was only twenty-
  five and looked like a smart young business girl of
  nineteen

  she wore a mustard-colored skirt that was tight on her
  hips and a blouse that was open at the throat her skin
  was tan but the blouse revealed a tiny portion of white
  at the breast she wore a green rain slicker thrown loosely
  over her shoulders and her feet and shapely ankles were
  booted with galoshes

  hello nick you old dog  she said lovingly she came
  into the room shedding the slicker nick closed the door
  and leaned back against it he wore gray trousers over
  his long legs they were held up by english-leather sus-
  penders kathie was glancing around the room

  it looks the same darling do you always carry your
  hotel rooms with you this looks exactly like the one you
  had in shanghai

  nick was smiling the only thing i ever change is the
  maps he nodded his head over there is a map of the
  united states

 she sobered oh nick-isnt it terrible	y

   a thing is always a thousand times worse when it comes
  home he said

  she nodded how have you been darling

  i wish you wouldnt call me that

  but i call everybody that

  i know

  nick-grumpy arent you glad to see me

  no

  he kept watching her sick and ashamed because see-
  ing her made him want to cry and yet his face was
  unchanged youre beautiful kathie he said do
  you know that each time a little more beautiful than
  the last he paused and went on quickly as matter-of-
  fact as possible where you going to live

  next door to you

  what he thought that he had heard wrong

  yes next door to you theyre putting my luggage
  in there now you know nick-the way it was in warsaw
  when we were in that siege together she laughed and
  im going to have secret dictaphones installed all over
  your room and write my articles about everything you
  find out

  sure he said the way it always-is

  yes thats it good old nick i dont know what id
  do withoutyou darling

  im glad i have my uses he said anyway youll
  have someones shoulder to cry on when the bombing
  starts

  did i ever cry during a bombing

  no he thought it over i dont think you ever cry

   kathie over anything he paused sit down and ill
  make you a drink

  she sat down tapping a cigarette on her polished red

                               -argosy-april -j

thumbnail nick crossed the room and moved into the
dinky pantry he tapped ice cubes out of a tray and
poured rum into tall glasses

  he noticed that his hand shook and it occurred to him
that he was not quite well he didnt know why he al-
ways went to pieces when he was near her it was plain
that she liked him only because he could give her infor-
mation for an article she spoke now

  i missed you at the boat

  he didnt turn i wasnt there

  that as the conclusion i came to i waited an hour
there was no telephone on the dock or i should have
called you to come and get me

  he squirmed miserably i have an important appoint-
ment hereat the room i had to stay in in the event my
party calledhe entered with the drinks he was awk-
ward and spilled rum on the mustard skirt her eyes came
up and met his he pretended he hadnt noticed

  he went to a chair and sat down he wound one long
leg over another coddled his drin and stared at the
windows there was a wind blowing and a few drops of
rain splashed across the dark panes

chapter iv

traitors town

t ater when he and kathie had talked for an hour
 and re-acquainted themselves he said about pana-
ma im wherever war is you know that kathie panama
city and cristobal will get the hell bombed out of them

  the first strike will be here and i have information
that itll come within forty-eight hours possibly its
cock-eyed information since the source isnt very good
but at any rate it wont be long

if the enemy wins the battle of panama-then what
kathie asked she was very clever on the typewriter
nick knew that she was memorizing every word he said
he shifted uncomfortably

  after panama i believe theyll make a stab at the east
coast cities-philly new york boston and newark the
first three have navy yards the fourth munitions factories
theyll mix military objectives up with a little terrorist
bombing the united states has only half a navy in the
atlantic and if the axis powers can bottle it up sink or
cripple it-theyll land a million men and the big war
will be on

   so their first objective will be the united states atlantic
squadron until theyve wiped that out they cant make
any moves without being so harrassed as to stand a chance
of a military set-back

  what about mexico

  its too big messy and decayed for them to run troops
across they may try to make use of native mexican
troops-attacking texas but that is largely a matter of
diplomacy the mexicans will hold off until they see which
way the war is going theyll talk a lot but thevll hold
off

 and russia 	v

  unless she is appeased in alaska theres a chance that
seattle may become another helsinki that will be a
land-arid-air operation-but we have strong troop enforce-
ments in the northwest and the russian bear may come
in for a trouncing even though their soldiers will out-
number the americans three or four to one

   remember russia is working independently of german-
italian-japanese powers she is simply taking advantage
of a situation too good to miss if she is given parts of
alaska she may hold off entirely to watch which way the
war goes

   and you think japan will attack on the west coast
   im certain of it

   then the united states is circled

   thats the way they fight nowadays nick said
when youre down they all pile on they think as long
as theyve got the nazis to lead them they cant lose
nick who are you working for

   nobody nick said did you want me to say i was
working for the government-im pot his glass the
third one was empty and he put it down the wind had
blown the window open and he got up and closed it out-
side there was the pattering of rain but im finding out
things the governmentll be glad to know he went on
he returned to his chair

   what angles do you work

   i play along with all the german importers and their
clerks with the alien refugees and that lot in every ten
i get to know theres one thats a spy and maybe three in
the fifth column-paid to commit sabotage and create
panic once the war starts i play along with all of them
what do they think you can do for them

t give them maps nick said grinning old maps
- that are no damn good but they send them to europe
and dont know that until months later i havfe other
angles along the same lines theyre underpaid wretches
sand its easy to fool them of course theyre suspicious
but they cant be sure just where i stand

   i tell them i worked for franco in spain and they be-
lieve it franco is a good nazi i tell the ogpu agents
that i was with the loyalists and they gush they make
fine stirring-and empty-speeches all of them-except
the real nazi agents-can be bought for two hundred
dollars theyd turn traitor to their country-so long as
they felt they wouldnt be caught

   i tell yoii kathie theyre a wretched scheming lot
theyre the army that enters and decays a country-rots
it from inside so that its ripe for invasion

   but if they ever find out-

   he nodded if they ever discover my only purpose
in mixing with them is so i can inform the united states
government-ill get a bullet in the back and theyre
bound to find out once the war is declared

   he paused it just happened that i was in a good
position to get to know these agents-being a linguist
and known as a writer-and rhy contributions to the cause
whatever their worth will be to help bring about their
arrests

f but nick-what about you

   i can take care of myself he said theres only one
man-a mark stohl-whos any good i think hes the
nazi intelligence chief here i know him only by hear-
say hed have seen through my simple strategy so 
didnt go near him stohl may be dangerous he smiled
but if you put any of this on the wires before im ready 
to break it kathie ill be a dead man tomorrow

   it had been agreed long ago that shed cable whatever
news he could give her only when he was ready to release it

   and you cant use my name he said im known as a
writer i hope and ill be damned if i want any by

destroyer



 kathrine winters publicity as a g-man you see why
 she was looking across the room at him why do you
 do all this nick risk your life and-

 because i hate them he said ive got a burning
 hatred and i fight them every way i know how

 why dont you have these men arrested now
 because some of them have minor diplomatic connec-
 tions proof would be hard to get thered be trials
 and red tape and until war does start theres little dam-
 age they can actually do but once hostilities begin its
 a different matter we grab them-give them a military
 trial-and take them out and shoot them

 nick was silent now and he and kathie sat and looked
 at one another it was like old times the room was full
 of stale cigarette smoke her second drink was scarcely
 touched and the ice had melted in it there was a tray
 full of red-smeared cigarettes in front of her rain beat
 against the windows and the radio played low now
 carefully analyzing all he had told her she asked a
 question

 you said you had a party coming here to see you
 tonight	

 yes a government man hes late

 you must be going to give him some information

 nick grinned you dont miss a trick do you all
 the same he felt a little cold about it he supposed it was
 futile to wish that fhe would like him more for himself
 and less for his intrinsic value

 is it something you havent told me

 he nodded

 what

 i cant reveal it kathie i trust you but i cant this
 is quite big it was information i just stumbled on

 and-

 it must be very important

 it is he said if its true it is	

 nick you actually sound frightened

 i am frightened he said its a thing which may cost
 thousands of american lives

chapter v

yes youll die

 she had gone to her room to unpack nick stood alone
 at the wet dark windows his hands in his pockets the
 world was different with kathie here and it occurred to
 him that even his thoughts were different he wiped his
 hand down over his face and now he turned

 remembering the time he was alarmed of a sudden he
 was furious with the government what he had to say
 seemed important it at least behooved them to hear him
 out he picked up the telephone and called a number he
 knew to be intelligence headquarters

 this is nick waters he said i was told one of your
 men would be here to see me

 there was an emergency mr waters at the last min-
 ute he was called elsewhere

 you might have phoned

 we intended to the voice said but weve been busy
 suppose you come down here

 it was clear that they were not much impressed with
 him and if the news had not been so important nick
 would have told them to forget it and banged up the
 receiver instead he said all right ill be there

  he put on his short pea-coat and went into the hall he
never wore a hat

  outside the air was crisp and wet and the palm trees
that lined the street were sinister and blowsy like tall
women who have neglected to comb their hair the shut-
tered frame buildings which squatted opposite one another
across the cobblestone canyons were from the smell t
least ancient with decay

   it irritated niclj that on the outskirts of cristobal there
flickered from the street corners no more than gas-light
he drove his car swiftly over the bumpy streets the rain
had turned to a thin drizzle and his windshield wiper
squeaked as it moved back and forth over the pane of
dripping glass

  intelligence headquarters were in a shabby building on
the other end of town electric lights shone down over
the dirty red-brown entrance and there were several cars
parked in the street

  inside it was somewhat like a police precinct with car-
petless unpainted wooden floors a navy yeoman sat at
 desk and when nick had given his name he was directed
to an office down the hall he entered without knocking

a grizzly bulldog of a man looked up from his desk
his eyes were small and black they seemed to look
through you his hair was tousled a mixture of jet black
and salt-gray the contrast of which gave an odd effect

  he had john l lewis eyebrows and the things you
noticed about his white face were the thick lips and that
jowls seemed to protrude from either side of his jaw his
expression was unpleasant and at once suspicious but at
the same time he seemed busy and harried his desk littered
with papers

  youre waters i suppose he nodded to a straight
chair please sit down nick was about to speak but
the other went on it occurred to me while you were on
your way over that there is a writer named nick waters
do you know him

  yes very well nick said i wrote many of his
books

  then you are he he indicated neither surprise nor
pleasure in fact the scowl on his face had deepened but
it seemed to nick that he was at least a trifle mollified

  my name is barton craig he went on i am in charge
of a certain branch of undercover operations in the panama
canal zonk nick could not help but admire the fact that
the intelligence chief wasted no words on cordiality if
you have any information we should be pleased to use it
in fact we are enlisting new agents wherever we can find
them

  when weve finished the business at hand perhaps we
could discuss an arrangement by which you can be of
service i think a man in your position-your reputation
as a writer is a perfect cover-up-could find a way of being
a good deal of help

  i hope so nick said

  then youre interested

  yes

  all right barton craig said now what is it youve
come to report

  but nick wasnt going to be rushed into anything he
carefully explained what he had been doing ive worked
only for myself its because i wanted to this is the
first war in which ive ever had an ax to grind the experi-
ences i had in all the others was only grist for the mill

                              -argosy-april -


argosy

here in panama ive rubbed elbows with some of the
worst men alive in one way and another ive gained
information-names and addresses-and once war starts
i think i can help round up the most dangerous of them
craig nodded

  from two of these underpaid foreign agents i think
ive learned something of vital importance neither man
knows the other and neither is aware that he revealed
anything meant to be secret one story i heard was rumor
the other  fact it was only by coupling them that the
thing took on significance

   craig seemed more interested now and h adjusted his
chair and prepared to listen

tt concerns an enemy base nick said i dont
pretend to know military business but from what
i have been able to find out all of the enemy bases are
quite a distance flying time even from panama

   thats true

  if they could operate from a small temporary base
closer to the canal the attack would be much easier

  do you know of such a base craig asked he had
plucked a hair from his shaggy eyebrows and was looking
at it but now he glanced up

   i think that i do nick said

   craig looked skeptical

   if it does exist nick went on it is an island barren
and rocky because it is in an out-of-the-way place-in an
archipelago along the coast of colombia-it probably
hasnt been carefully patrolled

   however the enemy has discovered that this one island
has miles of hard flat beach suitable for aircraft take-
offs and the information i have is that for the past two
days they have been assembling hundreds of airships here
for a tentative raid on the canal zone

   incredible

  i dont thinlc so said nick they could operate
from such a base until we discovered it small tankers
could bring fuel oil portable tents could be set up inland
for a pilots barracks itd be an ace in the hole that-in
the opening phase of the war-might cost our forces a
hell of a lot

  the intelligence chief stared at nick for a moment
studying his face he spoke sharply

  by your own confession he said this is simply
rumor panamas full of that if what you say is true its
damned well important but i hope youll give me some-
thing more definite to go on do you have any notion of
the longitudes of your hypothetical island

   just a general idea nick said but i think i could
locate it by air id like to try anyway

   first tell me how you came across the information
craig said

  nick explained the man i learned about it from is
named weil he says he discovered it one day by acci-
dent when a boat he was in jlew miles off its course he
nbticed the islands geographical possibilities and though
he was not veiy excited about it thought it worthwhile
to mentionit in a report to the axis powers after that
it slipped his mind

   the fool had literally struck gold and didnt realize
it even when he received a cable in code instructing
him to give further details he discounted it as routine and
without even visiting the island again wrote a report of
as much as he could remember he imagined if his chiefs

saw any possibilities in this new report they would order
him back to the island for a survey

  but instead he heard absolutely no more when he
spoke to his boss here in cristobal he was told the whole
thing was absurd instead of being commended he was
severely criticized for taking up the valuable time of his
chiefs with such nonsensical drivel

   the reason is clear they trust none of their men too
much and since he is a minor agent it seems obvious that
this thing was so important they were anxious that he
should learn no more about it

   on his part weil was hurt that his bosses considered
him blundering he regarded as gross mistreatment his
being raked over the coals simply for reporting a thing
which at least might have had significance

  one night in a bar after hed had several drinks
he told me about it he said it was a hard life he was
obliged to file a daily report and yet only one in fifty
actually contained information of tangible worth he cited
the business about the island as an instance where he had
put in a great deal of labor only to be told rather harshly
that he had wasted his time

  but about the enemy moving planes

  this i picked up from a russian who badly needed
a haircut he was boasting of the strength assembled
against us and he mentioned a number of blood-thirsty
rumors among them was one of a nearby secret base
he had no facts and probably ninety percent of every-
thing he said was untrue but this one statement stuck
in my mind i pumped him about it hed heard it some-
where he forgot the source by putting it together with
weils story-

raig had reached for a telephone and broke in on
 nick i should like lieutenant williams sent for
there was a pause i dont care if he is on leave-recall
him and have him report to this office at once  he banged
up the receiver i dont believe your tale at all waters
he said

  what

   no i dont believe you its fantastic we get rumors
like that all day long but the fact is i cant take the
chance that you might be right its a thousand to one but
this government cant afford to gamble im putting at your
disposal a navy seaplane and a pilot

  well i-

   craig raised his hand i told you earlier tonight that
the appointment in your room wasnt kept because we
were busy that wasnt exactly true we try to keep all
appointments the truth is i cabled washington for a
fyssier on you-if any existed

   you see i was pretty sure that you were waters the
writer just before you phoned i had my reply your record
seems to be clean this is a time when we need agents
very badly and a man of your caliber can be a good deal
of help he paused youre working for your govern-
ment waters a yeoman is already making up a service
record for you and preparing papers

  but i-

  tomorrow you can go through the routine of being
fingerprinted and sworn in i hope youll volunteer for
this service because otherwise ill have to draft you

  nick grinned craig had been a dozen jumps ahead of
him all the time and he couldnt help but admire him for it

   ill be glad to do what i can nick said

                            -argosy-april -
destroyer

 he wasnt quite prepared for what came next

 craig leaned back and folded his hands the island
 secret base is your first assignment he considered it
 may be your last

 what do you mean nick asked

 isnt it obvious if the enemy is fortifying such a base
 -mind you i dont believe it-they wouldnt be fools
 enough to leave it unguarded once you come down to
 observe them youll be spotted and i dont think theyd
 let you get away alive

 i guess youre right

 so if you find the island craig said you have one
 job and i depend on you to do it radio us the longitude
 and latitude if you can escape after that fine

 nick saw that craig considered him no more than a
 unit in the prosecution of war if he were fortunate to

 locate the island his only possible reward could be certain
 death the cold-blooded aspect of the thing amused him

  at least if i do find it they could say i was the first
man to die in action in the new war

  yes craig replied they could say that of you and
williams itd make a good military obituary bui person-
ally i dont believe in tributes in time of war everybody
risks death-even the civilians- these days i should think
it much harder to die of poison gas in a street two blocks
from home than in the execution of a maneuver you know
to be of value

  nick had thought of death very often without qualm
and now craigs logic made him ashamed for having been
so squeamish

  im beginning to like the old goat he thought

saga of a very scientific pugilist who could analyze every angle of his profession-except

a cheering house

 by eustace cockrell

   author of the divine right no minutes to go etc

a fighter
has to figure

im an old guy see i been around a long time a
long long time it said in the papers i was his
manager but i wasnt he paid me a salary so much
a week rain or shine fight or not he did all the manag-
ing that was done he made his own fights picked his
own spots

  i was his second he hired me because i am one of
the best seconds in the world i can do a lot for a guy
in that time you get to work between rounds thats
why he hired me he always hired the best he could why
two or three times he had sparrin partners could beat
the guy he was training for

  he hired me because i was one of the best seconds in
the country but that didnt matter i never told him
anything between rounds and he never come back to his
corner in trouble but once he reminded me of some


of them in the old days because he was no stumblebum

  you say they all got to get hit a lot and hurt a lot
not all of them did you ever hear of young griffo he
couldnt punch his way out of a paper sack with his hands
on fire but they never hit him solid when he was right
packy mcfarland fought ten eleven times once in a month
and was sore because he wound up with a black eye and
if jim corbett had a mark on him from fighting i never
saw it

  his name was cyril brady he was a natural middle-
weight weighed a hundred fifty-eight and never varied
more than a pound or two in or out of training

  he won thirty-two straights in the amateurs out on the
coast and there was a lot of guys trying to sign him up but
he never listened to them first time i ever talked to him
was one morning the phone woke me up at my hotel and j

-argosy-april -
a fighter has to figure



 he asks if he can come up and see me he told me who
 he was but it didnt mean anything i told him to come
 on up

   he came in the room i was still in bed he walked
 over and sat down in the chair and i tried to place him-
 he was a sallow-faced fellow and he looked like any clerk
 though he was kind of tall

   youre mr danny fayden arent you he asked
 and he didnt sound any more like a fighter-than he looked

   i admitted i was

   well he said from what i am able to read and
 observe you are probably the best man in the world for
 a boxer to have in his corner during a contest
 y maybe i am i said grinning

   i am anxious to make some arrangement with you
 he saidj theoretically he went on a situation could
 arise where the competence of your second could be the
 deciding factor in a fight

 leaving the theory aside i told him there are joes
 will tell you that me and whitey bimstein and ray arcel
 have won more fights than any three guys in the world
 i came to you because you are older than those you
 mention-

   came to me for what i interrupted

   to be my second cyril said i can beat any man
 in the world under a hundred and sixty pounds

 oh i said who have you beat so far

   nobody but a few amateurs he said i came here
 to new york to get some professional fights i think i can
 get along here faster there is more money and more
 talent

 how could you take a guy like that serious i grinned
 a little wider how many rounds for instance i
 asked would it take you to stow away mr eddie
 kincaid mr eddie kincaid being the champion

   i could beat him in fifteen rounds cyril said but
 im not ready for him he paused but that hasnt any-
 thing to do with it how much would you take to be
 my nominal manager for thenext five years and always
 bin my corner when i fight and work with me in training
 and so forth

   now things have not been so good i am not a manager
 and i am an old duck and have been around a long time
 there are joes will tell you that i am not as fast as  used
 to be and that i am strictly a windbag that talks about
 the old days

   oh i said aloud a hunnert and expenses-thats
 a week-and i guess we could deal this i say very
 offhand and sarcastic see

   this cyril takes out a sheaf of papers from his pocket
 they are typewritten papers and he takes a pen off the
 desk and makes a few fill-ins i am taking law he
 says by correspondence and i have drawn up this con-
 tract myself leaving the spaces blank for salary and so
 forth i have filled in one hundred and expenses will
 you sign here he points to the line

   now i take a little pause as they say i look over the
 papers they read all right to me and i am not so sleepy
 this is all right i tells him but what about  binding
 the bargain and i am not grinning soide

   he fumbles around in his pocket for a few seconds and
 brings out a billfold he peels off ten twenties and hands
 them to trie here are two weeks in advance he says
 will you sign

   good money see strictly uncle sams finest i sign
maybe i aint woke up

   i will take the contract with me he says tucking the
papers back in his pocket i will be fighting a six-round
semi-windup at eagans upstairs fight palace in queens
next tuesday night i will expect you to be there he
starts to go then stops at the door here is your ex-
penses he says get off at hunters point he hands me
a nickel for the subway

   i am out there all right i am out there with my kit and
a new sponge and my lucky bucket i am there right
on the dot cyril is sitting down in the booth they call
a dressing room with two three other bums they give
me plenty looks-i am famous see and i dont work
nothing but the garden and such spots as a rule

   marcus books is there i figure he owns most all the
fighters on the card hello danny he says i see you
got the reincorporation of stanley ketchel settin over
there howdoes it feel to be back in a champions corner

  i got to dummy up see i dont know nothing about
my boy the two cs got me out here i look around

   cyril is sitting in a corner reading a thick book he
has a new towel robe around him and he is sitting on
a little stool i ease over whore we fightin i ask
he looks up from the book hello he says

   who we fightin i ask again feeling silly

  oh he says a fellow named blunder roos it
doesnt matter		

  no now this blunder is a very good trial horse a
couple years ago and while he has gone way back to be
over here i remember him as a monkey with plenty of
moxie and strong in close 

  no he says and then we get our call and i go on
out behind him 

   we get up in the ring and the referee looks a little bug-
eyed when he sees me in cyrils corner but he dont do
more than grin

  blunder roos he says pointing like joe humphreys
used to but still not no more like joe than nothing hun-
nert fifty-nine and tree quarters

   which is a damn lie blunder has got a life-saver around
his belly and he had trouble making sixty two years ago
ancyril brady one fifty seven and tree quarters and
he cuts his hand like joe used to do pointing and marking
the weight though the worst seats in the house was closer
than you could get in the stadium for eleven-fifty and
they could have heard him if he was talking natural

cyril goes out and i go with him billy moore is third
in the ring and he tells the boys the same thing he
has told the boys always break clean and come out
fightin billy finishes

   we go back to the corner this blunder is a hooker
i says from habit trying to tell my guy right give him
a long left hand and wait a round or two

   cyril dont even look like he heard me he stands up
and looks out at the crowd from his corner would you
he yells rather i knocked him out or boxed his ears off
it was wonderful really wonderful they hate over
in queens like they hate the giants in brooklyn boy they
started hating that cyril right then

  this brady he is a long drink of water without no
muscle showing on him and he is sallow as a cheap candle
when he hollers that they really start hating him
kill im blunder

                            -argosy-april -

  gut him

  murder him

  it never got to blunder they aint anything got to
blunder for a long time but he grinned when they yelled
at him and came out bounding i was out of the ring like
twenty years ago fast

  cyril comes out and he is all oil hes got a left hand that
is long as a clothes line and thin so you cant hardly see it
he stabbed this blunder forty-two times more or less right
on the nose and he never got cooled off from blunder
fannin him he went away like tooney in the seventh at
chi that time but prettier and you couldnt have bought
a tomato for a quarter at washington market as big and
red as blunders nose come the bell

  cyril sits down in the corner and i give him a little
conversation and a little ice on the back of his neck he
shoves me away ill tell you what i want you to do he
says just leave me alone until i need you and when
i need you ill tell you

  id like to tell him the stupid that when he wants me
and heeds me he wont be able to tell me but not tonight
i get down slow halfway out of the ring with the ten-
second buzzer and there is c brady standing up talking
to the crowd i dont want to hurt him he yells so ill
knock him out this round

  and he did he stiffened blunder with a right cross
about halfway through the round and poor old blunder
was groping for the rope trying to pull himself up at ten
they tried to spit on cyril going down the aisle to the
dressing room

  what i asks him as he is putting on his clothes was
the idea of the speeches

  he looked at me people will come to see you hoping
youll win or hoping youll lose i want to get everybody
hating me so theyll come to see me lose then when i win
theyll hate me worse and come again when i fight
you dont expect ever to lose i suppose i says

  oh no he says

  the promoter bustles in the tloor then he pays cyril
off it is thirty-five bucks ill see you next tuesday
the promoter says

  yes cyril says how long would you like the fight
to last

  jimmy eagan is the promoter and he looks at cyril
youre fightin billy haynes he says and i hope billy
kills you

  youre paying me seventy-five dollars cyril says
according to our agreement as if i beat blunder well
mr eagan you hope billy haynes beats me so bad how
about paying me a hundred and fifty if i win and nothing
if i lose

  you damned well right jimmy says

cagan scaled his prices up forty percent and the joint
was packed they started booing cyril when we
started down the aisle but he didnt pay any more atten-
tion to them going up the aisle this time than if the place
was empty tonight he is playing cold silent contempt

  now billy haynes is a pretty good fighter and was
on his way up he is young and tough and very enthusias-
tic that is he is very enthusiastic for two rounds by
that time he is cut up so bad that the referee stops it

  cyril looks out at the crowd and shrugs his shoulders
like well its not my fault he was so over-matched

  the next day there is a little in some of the papers

about the fight and one writer comments on bradys lack
of sportsmanship

  brady is up in my room talking to me when i show
him this he looks at it and smiles i wonder why they
think it is a sport he says

   there are some guys i say that treat it like a sport
that-

  yes he says the blunder rooss he goes on then
i have a chance to fight a windup in jersey for two fifty
it is a week from friday i dont believe ill take it
no i says

  no he says i made some mistakes against haynes-
i dont think i want another fight for a month

  some mistakes i didnt see any mistakes it looked
to ihe like you done about perfect

  no he says he hit me twice in the first round
  oh i said you think this is a mistake

  yes he said while it didnt hurt me if eddie
kincaid had had those shots it might have been serious

   i ijust grunt

  i am in this business to make money he says not
to get hit

  that is an angle i says

   listen he said i worked two years three hours a day
hitting a bag on a long rope with my lefy i didnt just
happen to be able to stab a guy when i wanted to i
worked with the best boys that were in the gym and would
work with me for two years

  i saw every picture that eddie kincaid and all the
other topnotchers ever had taken of their fights twenty
thirty times i know every move they make by heart i
carried paper wads in my hands squeezing them all the
time for months to strengthen my hands

  i worked with the heavy bag four rounds a day i
sleep every night i eat very carefully im not a natural
i prepare for a fight the way a good lawyer prepares for
a case this stuff of acting mean thats just to make
people hate me so ill be worth more at the gate

  now this is something a little all right a guy that
wants to be a fighter and learns to fight that is certainly

a little different

v	 	l

a nd like he says he gets into the money in the ring
he taunts his opponents and out of the ting he taunts
his opponents he offers to fight them winner-take-all
he treats the crowds like morons to come to a fight so
uneven as him fighting somebody

and the time comes finally when he gets kincaid
it is like this he makes a match for himself with
one-round finnegan who is supposed to be the contender
and he agrees to fight finnegan for nothing if he gets
kincaid as and if he beats finnegan

  this gets into the papers and it packs the joint they
really hate this cyril by now he murders finnegan and
they have to stop it in the seventh

  and so he gets kincaid he gets kincaid in an outdoor
shot for june you think he dont know what hes doing
let me tell you how he trains for this one

  in the first place he does all his boxing at night under
the lights i fight under the lights he says why not
train under them your body is a thing of habit if
you get used to working your best at two oclock in the
afternoon thats when you are going to feel the best these
guys that train going to bed at nine for a fight thats gonna
be held at ten at night they get into the ring half sleepy

                             -argosy-april -
a fighter has to figure



  so he gets up at noon does his road work eats breakfast
at two-thirty lunch at six-thirty does his boxing at night
and eats dinner at eleven goes to bed at one-thirty every-
body thinks hes crazy but hes not crazy if you think
about it a little youll see he is right

  anyway he gets kincaid and he comes up for kincaid
very sharp but he does not seem to be thinking about
the fight and this worries me kincaid is a fighter he is
a real sure-enough champion he is a short wide guy
very tough a hitter

  the fight draws very well and the boos we get coming
up the aisle make cyril smile but still it is a funny smile
like he only hears them with one ear and he is thinking
about something else

  he goes out with the bell and starts stabbing kincaid
softening him up working on his eyes eddie kincaid has
a lot of scar tissue on his face and he cuts easy cyril
knows this very well

  eddie kincaid just grins and bulls in he like to get
his shoulder under a guys chin and fire at his belly with
both hands but he has never dealt with a man that can
go away like cyril and still punish you going away the
first round is cyrils by a mile

  but i am uneasy brady acts like he is worrying about
something like he is not thinking about the fight he
proves it in the second round

  eddie rushes him into a corner and brady ducks sits
down on the second rope and instinctively throws his hands
out before he knows what is going on kincaid has smashed
his nose over to one side of his face and dropped him
with a left hook to the chin and cyril is getting up not
taking a count and kincaid is rushing in slugging his best
and scoring plenty

  brady goes down again this time he doesnt get up
right away because he cant hes got a mouse over one
eye as big as a egg it looks like he makes it up at five
and gets into a clinch some way and weathers out the
round

   i go to work he has to be led to his corner and it takes
me a second or two to get him there i cut the mouse with
a razor blade suck out the blood get some collodion over
it get his mouth piece out and rinsed throw an ounce of
brandy down him clean up his nose and in the five seconds
before the buzzer pour some ice water down his spine he
sits there all the time like he is still out then he gets up
off his stool with the bell and with a mean look on his
face and both hands down cocked he marches out

boy what a brawl he gets slugged a couple of times
but he has got eddie backing up bleeding and half-
way through the round he drops eddie but he forgets to
go to a neutral corner right away and eddie gets about
fifteen seconds rest

  he comes back with the bell and sits down that guy
hurt me he said kind of resentful while i was thinking
about my bar examination

  bar examination i holler my god

  its tomorrow he says and i am not quite sound
on torts

  box this guy- i begin

  the buzzer sounds box him he says i am going
to knock him kicking so i can get some more studying in
tonight

  he goes out he is a pretty sorry-looking sight in spite
of the work i have done on him and he gets sorrier by the

minute but he is giving as good as he gets and the crowd
is standing up and eddie kincaid is backing up

  cyril catches him with a right cross and drops him but
eddie he scrambles right up and comes bulling in he
gets his shoulder under cyrils chin and belts him twice
in the belly and cyril goes pale and grunts the bell
rings

  cyril comes back very shaky that man he says he
can be sued for defamation of character for what he called
me in a clinch i never hit a man like that and had him
get right up he added

  he is a very tough tomato i tell him working like
crazy box him- the buzzer sounds and i climb down

  im about halfway mad at that fellow cyril says and
he marches out

  he acts like it he starts boxing and when hes boxing
hespretty but he steps into one and it drops him again

  take nine i scream

  he looks over at me climbing up on one knee and nods
but when he gets up he walks in and starts slugging

  they stand out there and slug and the crowd is crazy
they both got blood all over them by now but they aint
backing up finally eddie is the one to give ground and
cyril is after him hooking for his head getting him
measured finally he cuts loose with a right and eddie
goes down

  the bell rings

  you got all night i say take your time and keep
away from him

  i am going to beat his head off cyril says a little
thickly

  all the preparation and all the study and all the train-
ing is what saves cyril he is in a little better shape than
eddie and eddie starts slowing down and cyril piles on
a little pace and pretty soon he gets eddie set up and he
lets him have a one-two and the right drops him the
referee could have counted a hundred

  you should hear them howl they are standing up and
really yelling the ring is full of cops and they are trying
to get cyril to say something over the radio and he is
sitting there in his corner with a dumb look on his face

  are they cheering me he says finally in a low sort
of voice

  i say they are i said you are a dead game boy and
they always cheer them

  he feels his face with one hand as they cut off the
glove you fixed me up didnt you danny he said
you saved me

  thats what you pay me for i said

  im going to cut you thirty-three and a third out of
this gate he says and i am not going to take that
examination tomorrow

  oh i says

  ill take the examination sometime sometime when
i am getting along and cant fight but to tell you the
truth danny to hear em yell like that that is pretty nice
and he goes on and i need a manager i need a manager
awful bad

  ill get you another match with eddie i said grin-
ning well cut the champions end

  do that he say i wont get battered up like this
the next time and he adds ill murder the bum

  sure you will i tell him and anyway i add
theres a jillion lawyers but theres only one of you
champion of the world

author of pennies from chaosy option on eldorado etc

   i i

twisting the truck off the wheelroad and into the
clearing where the plantation huts clustered i pre-
pared myself to meet a bombardment of questions
from cort cormick while returning along the hedged
fringe of our cacao groves id been rehearsing the answers
as best i could knowing in advance that cort wouldnt like
any part of them

  hed be particularly concerned under these special cir-
cumstances of course because a hurricane was due at any
minute to come spinning across southern costa rica from
its breeding grounds in the panama gulf

  a tropical disturbance oj small area hut considerable in-
tensity south oj the azuero peninsula is reported advanc-
ing northwestward at a rate oj fifteen knots

  during the past day and night our battery radio had re-
peatedly warned us in flawless castilian and with increas-

ing urgency that the wind was veering our way the latest
announcement even more pointedly had promised the
velocity at the storm center is more than one hundred
miles per hour and though some oj its force tnay be ex-
pended while moving across the isthmus the direct center
will pass over punta blanca-which within a few negligi-
ble miles specifically meant us

  the big breeze however like the misses -sarilla and
sabina stebbins whose arrival cort was momentarily ex-
pecting was slightly delayed

  cort appeared on the porch in clean whites as i jammed
the truck to a stop and a strained smile faded off his face
hed been practicing smiling i suspected his blue eyes
darkened when he saw that id brought the stebbins lug-
gage but not the sisters themselves

  where are they mac he asked his voice as ominous-
ly calm as the breathless air



while viquez held me up out of the
dirty bubbling tide cort was grappling
with taggart in a splashing welter

  youll have to hold yourself in for another hour i
said thats whenim instructed to call for their bookish
highnesses

  i	was just back from port limon where cort had sent
me to pick the two misses jjtebbins off the minoneta a
northbound freighter hed never seen them and had re-
fused to come along on the grounds that he couldnt trust
himself within speaking distance of them except in private
for several months hed been nursing his ire in anticipa-
tion of this day when he could confront sarilla and sabina
stebbins personally instead of their long exasperating
jointly written letters

  waiting here he had meant to welcome them with the
politeness which should be accorded two elderly maiden
librarians even though they had driven him almost crazy
with their tart fault-finding his determination to be cour-
teous at all costs had put him under a strain for his way
was to talk with hard-hitting man-to-man candor and
once he cut loose at them it would be something to hear

                                                  

mow the ruddy lines of corts mouth were deeper show-
 ing that the delay was undermining his gallant in-
tentions whered you leave them mac he asked and
why

  punta blanca but they didnt deign to enlighten me as
to their reasons for taking that particular detour

he stared as if id lost my mind the point of all
places couldnt you make them understand the danger
i was as persuasive as i know how to be amigo they
gave me two cold stares and a scornful lift of their noses
in unison of course theyve hardly ever been outside the
city limits of sedalia missouri but they remarked that
theyre well able to take care of themselves thank you
they know even less about central american weather
than they know about tropical agriculture cort snapped
you should have brought them forcibly if necessary
you know cort they automatically veto anything you
or i may suggest as-for punta blanca they told me that
anyone with a grain of sense in his head can see its a per-
fectly safe and lovely spot

  the misses stebbins had remained hautily unimpressed
when id explained that so far as current atmospheric con-
ditions were concerned appearances were treacherous

  the sun was liquid light and the zenzontles in the coco-
nut fronds were gayly mocking the cries of the cormorants
gnats swarmed undisturbed in humid air that stirred not
at all the vermillion blossoms of the erythrinas which
shaded our precious criollo trees hung as still as oil paint-
ings

  and all this beautiful peacefulness was false though
there was nothing to indicate whether the wind would strike
in fifty minutes or five the true omen was in the unnatural
color overhead-a peculiar portentous purple

  i called their attention to the sky cort and told them
what it means i added and they said they think its
quite pretty

  in less than an hour the storm will certainly hit the
point if theyre caught in it theyll never be seen again
they simply dont realize what theyre in for and we cant
leave them there no matter why they went

  if they get blown ninety miles out into the mosquito
gulf i said it will simply be rank impertinence on the
part of the hurricane which doesnt know whos boss around
here

  cort went into the house where the porch furniture was

piled all around us were signs of expected trouble elo-
quent enough to anyone who has ever experienced the
meteorological hell that brews in the doldrums the awn-
ings were reefed with heavy ropes the windows vere stout-
ly shuttered all the mats were rolled up our books were
piled on chairs everything movable was massed in the
center of each room and tied under tarpaulins

autside the weaker branches had been hacked off the
 mangroves and the coconuts had been shaken from the
nearby palms so they wouldnt be hurled through our
fermenting and drying sheds-or perhaps through the
blacks or us-with cannonball force

  our superstitious blacks had fled from their pod-gather-
ing and were huddling under their thatched roofs far qi
the rear of the hilly clearing their low but fearful chant
reached us as we took a look at the barometer through-
out the day the mercury column had steadily dropped it
was at  now and still shrinking like a thin silver
snake crawling into the shelter of its hole

  we ought to stake and lash the truck i reminded
cort no telling when the windll hit and we dont want
our uariol to go whooshing clear across the caribbean to
santo domingo trouble is the sisters stebbins decreed
precisely an hours wait and if we get back early theyll
give us a piece of their minds which might be worse than
the blow

  im going after them right now cort said turning
decisively to the door

  i thought you would and i followed him well
you drive and ill pray

  climbing to the wheel he paused thinking that we
should first store the stebbins luggage in the house but
seeing at once that it would take too long each miss
stebbins had a trunk several bags an assortment of hat-
boxes and a tangle of brightly decorated gourds strung on
colored strings

 when stopping off at several way ports theyd taken a
fancy to the decorative calabazas which the indians sell to
touristy at ridiculous prices evidently the misses stebbins
felt their collection would add a feminine touch to their
new home

  they werent here you see for just a brief visit they
planned to stay permanently to take charge

  letting the stuff lie untouched we started off to rescue
the willful ladies without whom our lives would be far
happier

ii

thhe wind held off though i thought i heard the first
faint whine of it in the distance the continued delay
was small satisfaction for when it came it would play
havoc with our trees we werent cultivating the hardy
forastero variety of cacao but the more delicate criollo
the best grown anywhere our beans brought the highest
prices and went into the making of the choicest confections
and the finest liqueur-when we produced any beans

  the chiollos were as fussy as chronic invalids and for
six years bart stebbins and cort cormick and i had babied
them if they didnt get their hundred to hundred and
fifty inches of rain they wilted without their eighty-degree
fahrenheit shade they curled up and diecj

  this year fortunately theyd had both just right wed
managed to stave off a disastrous blight called witch broom

                           -argosy-april -

and the spreading erythrinas had saved them from a wither-
ing sun

  perhaps it was just as well that bart stebbins hadnt
lived long enough to see these fruits of our labors for now
that the hedges had at last grown high and thick enough
to protect the tender criollos from any normal wind they
were about to feel a full-grown hurricane

  not caring to think that it might destroy our groves
we thought instead of what it might do to bart stebbips
two sisters who had inherited his two-thirds interest and
whose durability was equally questionable

  there was a growl in corts throat as we jounced urgent-
ly along the pitted road and i knew he was thinking that
barts sisters should have learned a lesson from the end
hed met our senior partner had been caught in a small
hurricane last year struggling to brace the sagging walls
of the nursery during the height of it hed drowned on
land indoors

  why the hell mac cort asked suddenly did those
women insist on being taken to punta blanca

  thats one i cant answer i admitted but going
back to the beginning miss sarilla and miss sabina clip-
pered down to port of spain where they transferred to the
miiioneta they landed at limon ahead of schedule-
yesterday afternoon instead of this morning as wed ex-
pected-so they spent the night at la posada del norte
why didnt they let us know they should have at least
phoned even if you and i are to be treated like a couple of
dim-witted house boys

  maybe they used their extra time to ask questions about
us if so they certainly mustve found out something that
makes them suspect us of villainous deeds

  suspect us wrenching the truck around a rough
bend cort frowned theyre overlooking the fact arent
they that weve labored like maniacs for years to get the
plantation into the best possible shape after all our
share of it is everything we possess in this world

  i thought theyd be cool naturally but i warn you
cort this is going to be even tougher than youve expected
the relations between the misses stebbins and us had
grown steadily worse letter by letter ever since they had
chosen to assert themselves their two-thirds interest out-
voting our joint one-third they had insisted on supervising
the plantation by remote control we would fume over an-
other of their lengthy acrid letters an picture them with
their prim heads together over their books in their musty
little library in missouri agreeing that cort and i were a
pair of shiftless good-for-nothings

  a born planter now backed by twelve years of raising
copra in papua sisal in yucatan and coffee in tijuca cort
cormick had never in all his experience encountered any-
thing like the stebbins sisters misguided long-distance
tyranny

  small wonder wed shuddered at the sight of every
mail boat for when cort had heatedly protested that we
were damned near killing ourselves in our efforts to make
the plantation pay and that the toil of it left us neither
the time nor the energy to write the detailed day-by-day
reports which they demanded they had answered

   either you are woefully incapable of meeting your respon-
   sibilities or else you are disgracefully idolent you will con-
   tinue to submit precisely such information as we have re-
   quested signed sabina stebbins miss- sarilla stebbins
    miss

   now completely displeased with us they had descended
upon us with the purpose of taking the management of the
plantation firmly into their own totally inexperienced
hands

rpheir school-teacher attitude the way they treat
us like a couple of backward pupils-thats the least
of it cort said abruptly sooner or later the realities of
the job would knock some practical sense into their heads
 still flinging the truck toward punta blanca in an effort
to outdistance the wind his thoughts had taken the same
course as mine

   the real trouble is that the job will kill them first
they havent got what it takes-neither the physical stam-
ina nor whats more important the moral courage if
they could be reasonable about it theyd leave the real
command to a man but they wont admit the necessity of
that and wont do it theyll go blithering mad meanwhile
blaming us for if

   grimly i agreed with him we were smack on the thermal
equator the heat sapped our vitality cooked our brains
and at times was downright murderous the humidity was
often so thick as to clog our lungs to the point of suffoca-
tion the incessant downpours during the wet season could
dissolve the morale right out of a strong mans heart

  there were swarms of fleas gnats and bloodthirsty
ticks there were terrifying winds such as the blow head-
ing our way right now it was a rare white woman whose
spiritcould survive in this tropical purgatory

   lord knows what well have left of the plantation after
the hurricanes passed cort added we may have to
start all over again from scratch it wouldnt be so bad if
the sisters had the guts to see it through in fact id like
to meet a white woman whos fit- he skipped the rest
of that thought but two frail village-bred spinsters con-
stantly complaining frightened out of their wits my
lord mac thats too much

   frail spinsters for a second i considered telling cort
about the shock first sight of them had given me but i
decided against it hed find out soon enough for himself
and i rather looked forward to watching his reaction

   you havent said what you-re going to do about em i
reminded him hanging onto the seat as he swerved around
another bend that would presently chute usdown to the
point sell out

   corts jaw set in disgust he had suggested a fair figure
to the stebbins sisters they had countered with an offer
so niggardly thafto accept it would mean not only years of
labor gone for nothing but the almost total loss of our
original investment wed be left one step removed from
the financial condition of a pair of cocovarian beach-
combers

   damned if i will cort said

  chuck the whole thing make them a present of it
  ill not he roared

   then how does all this work out

  somebody breaks cort promised doggedly some-
body cracks up

   fumes of lube trailing behind us we were coming down
now to punta blanca a white promontory overlooking
white sand and a wide bide stretch of the gulf a lonely
arm of rock ideal for a weather station but lacking one it
was sparsely treed almost directly below still a mile
away a solitary figure was moving that would be one of
the stebbins sisters unaware of our approach she seemed


argosy

to be looking for something by the way she moved

  you havent told me yet mac why they came here

  the lone figure was momentarily cut from view as i
answered they simply insisted on being taken they
mustve had a reason but they werent saying what it was
they didnt trust me they were so suspicious they made
sure i wouldnt stick around to spy on them-watched until
i drove out of sight but as for why-

rphe shot was a completely unexpected resonant boom
- in the still air it thumped in our eardrums as we skirted
behind a thicket at almost the same time we again
glimpsed the same miss stebbins she had halted and
seemed to be losing her balance trying vainly to steady
herself the truck crashed ahead more rapidly and we saw
her fall she simply dropped flat with a certain liipp
finality

  the next instant a mans head and shoulders popped
vaguely into view nearby and as swiftly vanished

  good lord somebody shot her i blurted too stunned
to know i was speaking aloud hes running away

  my glimpse of him had been so brief that i had no
idea who he was

  the report was bringing the second miss stebbins into
sight evidently she had wandered off from her sister and
now she reappeared from behind a weathered pile of stone
she didnt realize what had happened or was too bewildered
to move quickly

  something distracted her attention from the spot where
her sister lay still suddenly from a position that was hid-
den from us the gun struck again and exactly like her
sister the second miss stebbins wavered dropped and
sprawled motionless 

  we saw this as we sped on to the point but of the man
who had fired the gun we saw nothing more

  cort jumped from the truck the moment hed taken it as
far as it could roll and i scrambled after him the second
sister was not visible now having tumbled into a shallow
crevice but the first was directly ahead bending over her
cort was frozen for a moment and i got that reaction id
been waiting for-though certainly under different cir-
cumstances from those id expected

  this miss stebbins was nothing like the woman he had
expected to see she was young not more than twenty-five
with hair the color of pale sherry a pretty fjce that was
almost sweet she was wearing a pinafore sports outfit and
there was a red blotch on her blouse directly between her
breasts

  startled and wordless cort turned from her and sought
the second miss stebbins the second sisters wound was
near her temple-an ugly gash-but i judged from my
quick examination that the bone was scarcely scratched
unlike the other girl this one was alive once he was suie
of this cort saw that her appearance was the same as the
others in every stitch of her dress and every line of her
face the two of them were as alike as two beans from the
same criollo pod

  cort said my gosh mac why didnt you tell me

  a soft gentle rain had begun to fall as we bent over the
sister who hadnt been killed the sun had faded into a
purple twilight and the tops of the trees were shaking the
ground wind was still a whisper with only a hint of a
whistle in it but there was a vibrating hum somewhere in
the sky a deep drumlike roll in the distance and at last
the start of the hurricane was here

 ill

cort was inside the truck with both the dead miss
stebbins and the one who still lived and i was fighting
the wheel the rain no longer a soothing patter was
striking down at an angle

  though the road was already streaming we were going to
get the western half of the hurricane which precipitates the
most water and so far wed seen very little of it

  the truck rocked and skidded but kept its wheels un-
derneath ground swells were rolling along the coast still
comparatively sluggish-twenty or thirty knots i guessed
soon to increase to express-train speed the gusts were
taking a few vicious preliminary slaps at the trees when i
swung into the clearing the blacks huts were dim behind
the slanting downpour but we were lucky to reach the
house while the fun was still getting under way

  we carried the dead girl into my bedroom and put her
under a tight tarpaulin the other still unconscious we
tucked into corts bed we were too stunned by the un-
accountable brutality of what had happened to think of
bringing in the luggage or staking down the truck while i
broke out the first-aid kit and worked over the wounded
girl cort ground the crank of the telephone

  who was the man with the gun mac he asked did
you get a better look at him than i did

 applying iodine to the girls injury i shook my head

  we had a line connecting with the united fruit wire be-
tween limon and san jose cort intended that the port
police should learn of the attack as soon as possible after
twisting the handle for a full minute he slammed the re-
ceiver on the hook

  cant get through

  the instant he opened the door a gust shook the room
he leaned against the wind and with his shielded eyes
traced the phone wire the angle of the rain was sharper
now it sheeted past the door like high wavefi seen through
a porthole and a swirling eddy flooded across the floor
cort pulled himself back inside and braced against the door
to force it shut he had stayed under the porch but the
whole length of him was drenched

  the wires still up as far as i could see i dont believe
its blown down anywhere so soon as all this theres not i
enough of a breeze yet

  we looked at each other with the same thought in our
eyes the man who had shot the stebbins sisters had
watched us while slipping away from punta blanca he
had foreseen that there would be a call to limon and at
some point aleng the road he had cut the wire

  somehow we felt sure without knowing why that hed
intended to murder both misses stebbins and we wondered
whether he knew his bullet had all but missed the mark
the second time if he did know what would he do about
it-find an escape under cover of the hurricanes aftermath
or first try to finish the job since wed be isolated from
limon for hours or very possibly for days it was rather
an important subject for speculation in search of an an-
swer cort probed into the wounded girls pockets

 twins he said you didnt tell me that either mac

  i shrugged

  wasnt too surprised to learn it i rolled a bandage
over the girls forehead other thing about them ajl un-
pleasant impressed me more so i forgot

  shes much younger than i thought almost good-look-
ing not at all like the sort of person she seemed in their

                             -areosv-anril -
blow cold blow hot



letters you didnt mention that either he glared at me
  no i said i wanted to save that

until wed found bart stebbins will we hadnt even
known about his sisters being by nature unusually
taciturn hed never mentioned having any relatives in the
states for their part probably assuming that their brother
had told us all the personal details necessary they had
confined their correspondence to business matters

  from their letters wed formed the impression that they
were bespectacled top-knotted sharp-nosed and sniffy
and i still felt that the surviving sister must be just like
that inside despite her unexpectedly pleasing exterior

  do her looks make any difference its still a fact that
shes here to rule the roost and demote us to the position of
ignorant servants she still has a rare talent for nagging
hell out of us for no justifiable reason shes not feeling
superior and scornful and suspicious at the moment so her
face is relaxed quite changed maybe shes capable of be-
ing a very nice girl and we brought out the worst in her but
when she comes to youll see the difference

  cort straightened with a bit of closely folded paper hed
found hurt badly

  just concussion and shock i think but shes staying
out longer than she should her inborn perverseness ac-
counts for it no doubtdont quite understand it but its
best to let her rest

  which sister is this one sarilla or sabina

  i donft know to me it doesnt matter by any name
at all shed be just as objectionable

  you didnt tell me they were twins cort murmured
id no idea theyd be so young and almost pretty

  big winds do strange things to a persons emotions al-
ready cort seemed to be feeling certain peculiar effects

  i found the rum bundled in a cupboard brought half a
glass of it and trickled some between the wounded girls
lips she spluttered and her face screwed up but her eyes
stayed closed and she remained inert it was a puzzling re-
action cort was reading the note hed found and the lines
of his jaw were hardening

  listen to this mac its scrawled in pencil some words
misspelled and its signed un amigo dear miss steb-
bins it begins just miss which one could it have been
meant for

  what does it say

   cormick and macomber are stealing plenty since your
brother died tricking up the books faking reports holding
out mucho dinero j savvy because they did me dirt so
look out for them i want to see fair play and will tell you
how to prove they are two sneaky crooks if you will come to
punta blanca tomorrow afternoon three sharp danger-
ous so keep mum and come alone 

  it angered and at the same time enlightened me that
explains it-why they were so close-mouthed and suspi-
cious they believed that stuff believed we were putting
something over on them and they wanted to get the goods
on us before confronting us who the devil fed them that
mess of lies

  the note disappeared inside corts clenched fist i can
guess in fact im pretty sure whos behind this neat piece
of dirty work

  a fat chance well stand of convincing this girl that
that notes a phony i pointed out especially now that
her sisters been killed full of suspicions as she is already
she wont think twice before accusing us of trying to kill

them both in an attempt to cover up cort you mean
taggart red taggart

rpaggart who had once been a marine engineer was a
perpetually drunken bully no longer permitted to set
foot on any self-respecting skippers deck hed later been
a recruiter in new guinea and had lost his license through
his brutal misstreatment of indentured natives under
charges of inciting to riot a result of his barroom fights
hed been deported from most of the caribbean islands

  three weeks after wed hired him in a moment of mis-
taken sympathy aroused by his promises to reform wed
kicked him out for petty thievery since wed learned at
first hand that he was a vindictive schemer-thered been
several fires and other instances of sabotage to the planta-
tion afterward-i felt sure cort must be right

  hed hit back at us through sheer meanness i agreed
but why under heaven should he deliberately want to kill
two young women whod never before set foot in this
country

  this note hides the reason for it cort judged at once
its not what it seems he knew nothing to tell the steb-
bins sisters about us except such drunken lies as he could
cook up he could have pumped such stuff into them at
limon without appointing a rendezvous- his purpose was
to draw them to a lonely spot

  last night mac within a few hours after theyd gotten
off the boat somethingtiappened that made him decide hed
have to kill them and so-

  i was raising the rest of the rum to my mouth and with
nerve-shattering suddenness the glass went to pieces right
in front of my face not realizing what had happened i
simply found myself holding the jagged bottom while
fragments flew and amber liquid dribbled down my chin

  cort threw himself into a flying tackle and wrenched me
to the floor sprawled there in blank astonishment i saw
the telephone receiver jump off the hook and dim little
spots appear in the wall behind it

  there was no sound of shots the wind was pounding a
deep roll on the drums of the sky and above that rumble
was a shrill sharpening whistle the reports had simply
been blown into oblivion

  but the silent bullets kept coming drilling in through
the north wall striking with almost inaudible impacts in
murderously strategic spots each hole bled rain as we
were scurrying to pull the girl off the bed another appeared
a few inches above her head cort and i slid her down with
the mattress but that bullet was the last-for then

  he wants us all dead now cort said

iv

cort peered out through one of the holes and i put my
eye to another we saw almost nothing but sluicing
gray several storage huts sat nearby on the north quaking
all over dim in the flying downpour

  taggart-though there was no material evidence what-
ever to support our belief we were morally certain it was
taggart-had stationed himself behind one of the huts
and perhaps was still there

  cort opened a closet put his luger in my hands decided
against his scott shotgun in favor of his enfield  for
his own use he loved guns to him they were old-time
comrades who never failed his trust

  he signaled me-the jiowl of the storm was beginning

                          -argosy-april -


argosy

to make conversation difficult-and when he sidled out i
bore against the door and after two attempts succeeded in
hooking the latch the whole room vibrated and another
foamy wave rippled across the floor

  through a bullet hole i glimpsed cort bending himself
forward step by step a struggling ghostly figure the full
fury of the blow hadnt yet hit us and if anyone could
hang onto the land i felt reasonably sure cort could man-
age it

  my part was to watch miss stebbins and i did so revolv-
ing slowly on my heels because no sound of an approach
would be audible through that all-piercing banshee wail

  also beginning to feel the strange psychological effects
of the pressure which often causes normal people to behave
in a slightly irrational manner i began to talk to the girl
lying on the mattress at my feet so far shed shown no
signs of returning to her senses and she probably couldnt
have heard me clearly even if shed been conscious but i
talked to her anyway

  youre dangerous to taggart not simply because he
fatally shot the other miss stebbins youve probably
never met him you dont know him by name and being off
by yourself at the moment you didnt witness the attack
on your sister

  no it isnt that theres some other reason for it which
i dont know but heres the way its shaping up taggart
meant to kill you tried then saw he hadnt pulled it off
and now because youre still alive and still a menace to
him hes going to do his best to correct the error

  i thought i saw her lids flutter a little but her face re-
mained placid

  thats not all i added we must get the rest of it
clearly in mind because its obviously of deadly import-
ance taggart thinks cort and i recognized him at punta
blanca that makes cort and me dangerous to him too be-
sides he probably figures that youve told us something by
now-whatever it is you may know about him-something
he doesnt want repeated

  the only way he can save himself it seems is to murder
the three of us with the whole country being twisted out
of joint by this hurricane-and after-effects will paralyze
it for weeks-he stands a swell chance of getting away
clear

  was there a flush now in the girls cheeks we were
steeped in a purplish gloom and it was as hard to see clear-
ly as it was to hear anything below the scream of the mon-
ster vacuum cleaner that was sweeping over us

  but a sound insinuated its way through the uproar and
drew me to one of the bullet-cut peepholes cort was push-
ing his way back head bowed against the driving water
still gripping the rifle near him something of big uncer-
tain shape was crawling a car

tt was little short of miraculous that the ignition sys-

  tem of any car could continue to function while water
streamed over it with fire-hose force but this one moved a
little nearer before it stalled a man struggled out of it
cort locked arms with him and they breasted their way
together to the door the storm burst into the room with
them and the three of us managed to shove the door back
into its frame before it was ripped from its hinges

  the beautiful blue uniform of esteban viquez teniente
of the provincial police was thoroughly soaked under his
slicker he struggled for breath while rain ran out of his
nostrils a young coffee-brown handsome officer of pure

spanish blood he had a strong sense of duty which not
even a hurricane could demolish and as he gasped he
looked soberly purposeful

  for amor de dios it had not yet started when i left
limon amigos it isnt very bad yet but soon the wind
will tear the whole world apart i am lucky to be inside
here no es verdad

  water poured off every line of cort and a trickle came
from the barrel of his rifle

  no sign of anybody out there mac he reported
breathing hard but i doubt that hes gone hiding some-
where beyond the edge of the clearing probably hell be
back

  then youre not so lucky to be here after all teniente
i observed somebodys made up his mind to kill us and
now youve probably added yourself to the list

  ah said esteban viquez with another smile then
it is as i feared and i was right to come he crossed the
shaking floor gazed down at the still girl nodded vigor-
ously ah in the other room he pulled the tarpaulin off
the face of the other girl who was dead ah-h he said
sadly then he strode back his dark eyes fiercely lighted
puzzled yet clear the one who lives-she is the senorita
sabina stebbins no

  corts eyes mirrored the question and i had to shake my
head

  weve still no idea which one she is i dont under-
stand why shes staying unconscious so long but so far
she hasnt spoken a single word

  por dios it is necessary to know what is the name of
this girl  said the teniente if she is the senorita sarilla
then there is no reason why anyone should molejt her
further but if she is the senorita sabinar then there is
someone who thinks that she must as you say be killed
comprende ah i will try to explain amigos

we conversed with a feeling that no words were
 being spoken amid the drummiiig and the crying
of the wind we seemed to be using an unnatural means
of mental communication esteban viquez boots made
tracks back and forth across the wet floor while cort kept
an eye near one of the bullet-holes the injured girl lay
quite still and every time he glanced at her the tenientes
dark eyes became mystified yet sad

  do you know he asked aii hollander by name
willem van vreer

  neither cort nor i had ever heard of him

  he is dead now viquez said in limon last night
he was most brutally murdered no ne can say who
killed him except perhaps this girl buif perhaps not even
she it depends entirely upon which one of the senoritas
stebbins she is if the one yes she knows if the other
no she knows not comprende ah i will explain
esteban viquez strode back and forth from one shaking
wall to another turning frequent glanqes at the uncon-
scious girl and striving with many gestures to clarify
the situation

  aboard the minoneta the same boat which brought
the two senoritas yesterday came the dutch gentleman
willem van vreer it is known that he became friends
with the senoritas during the voyage from port of spain
to port limon like the two senoritas he took a room
last night at la posada del norte he was a short man
but fat and he moved himself about with much difficulties
he leaned himself on a crutch when he waftad because

                            -argosy-april -


blow cold blow hot



 his right leg was contained in a plaster cast now we come
 to the moment of importance

   viquez pursued his lips regretfully over the inert girl
 then resumed his restless pacing

   there were several radiograms waiting at the posada
 for the fat holandes last evening he went limping to the
 office of tropical radio where he sent several answers to
 a business house in new york the dutch imports ex-
 change limited it is called i have since read all these
 messages which are in english but difficult to understand
 those from the states hint that he was engaged upon a
 certain mission of importance and they warned him to take
 the best care of himself his answers stated that so far
 all arrangements were satisfactory and his journey was
 safe but within an hour amigos he was dead with three
 bullets in his heart

   the whole house quaked evidently we had been hit
 by a solid mass of sand-laden water scooped up from the
 coast the foundations held though an ominous ripping
 noise began vibrating through the roof

   now we arrive at the moment of importance viquez
 repeated ignoring the fury of the storm and concentrating
 on his report returning from the radio office the dutch
 extranjero was met outside the hotel by a man i do not
 know who was this man but it is certain an unknown
 man met the hollander in the street and induced him to
 get into a waiting car perhaps by offering to take him for
 a short sight-seeing trip

   i did not see this though i was sitting only a few
 yards away in the bar of the posada what i saw was
 something else it wafe a senorita stebbins amigos it
 is necessary that you must understand this situation most
 clear

   though the wind was blowing holes through our minds
 we pictured it

  at the exact moment when the unknown man was
putting the dutchman van vreer into the car- one of
the senoritas stebbins turned from the street to the door
of the posada she saw them though she was quite un-
aware of the meaning of the incident watching her-but
seeing nothing of the two men myself please to understand
-i heard her say good evening mr van vreer and i
heard him answer her ah good evening this is miss
sabina is it not i heard her laugh a little and say yes
i am sabina good night now comprende the
senorita sabina saw the man who was with the dutchman
and soon the dutchman was quite dad

  then miss sabina can identify that man as van
vreers murderer cort said

v

esteban viquez nodded with great vigor at that
moment of course she did not dream that anyone
was about to be killetj she merely strolled into the posada
and ascended to her room where her sister was no doubt
waiting the man took the dutchman away in the car

   when we found him this afternoon amigos it was
 strange the plaster cast was gone from his leg i have
 decided that it was carefully broken off and carried away
 before he was thrown into the water

 his cast stolen i blurted was his leg really hurt
 si amigos actually the leg had been broken and was
 healing i was told by another passenger to whom the
 dutchman himself told it that the leg was the result

of a misstep on a slippery deck while van vreer was
traveling to the america of the south from i believe west
africa

  it being a real injury the cast would make an es-
pecially good hiding place for something cort said
somebody must have been watching the dutchman-
sonjebody who drew his own conclusions as to the mean-
ing of those radiograms evidently the dutchman was
carrying something to the states and his murderer stole
it from him

   ah it i tob possible viquez sighed even while the
dutchman was limping from the radio office back to the
posada his room was ransacked finding nothing there
the criminal learned that the valuables must be on the
lame mans person

  the most important thing now cort said is that
the murderer knew that sabina stebbins could point him
out

  as soon as we found the unfortunate dutchmans
body floating in the water i realized this said the
teniente knowing that the senoritas have come here i
made haste to follow and still i have learned nothing
more his shrug said he was in a most unhappy plight

   most of its pretty clear cort i said the note was
written and slipped under their door last night with the
idea of drawing them into a trap

   but its not as simple as that cort answered thought-
fully the man knew a girl had seen him knew hed have
to shut her up so after killing the dutchman and stealing
the plaster cast with whatever was hidden inside it he came
back without arousing suspicion he could inquire who
is the girl named sabina and he would be told of
course shes miss sabina stebbins

   her name being the same as barts her position would
automatically become clear especially if taggart is the
man but the fact that the note was addressed to only
one of the sisters not to both of them together means
a lot do you see that mac

   not quite i confessed

   cort was shouting through the shrieks of the wind and
i had that strange sense of not actually hearing his voice

   it means that the man whod killed van vreer didnt
know there were two girls exactly alike in appearance
he went to punta blanca thinking there was only one
girl involved now visualize it from his standpoint mac
hes there hiding gun ready he sees a girl appear he
shoots her

   ah-h said the teniente in a grieved tone

  feeling that he has now safely eliminated the only
witness in the case of the dead dutchman he begins to
crawl away then suddenly standing there before him
is the second girl looking so much like the first that she
might be her ghost sight of her rocks the killer on his
heels the next moment of course he grasps the fact
that hes dealing with twins

  he has already killed one of them but is that one
sabina the witness hed meant to eliminate he has no
way of knowing whether she is or is not maybe hes
already silenced the witness but on the other hand maybe
its the second sister whos really the dangerous one being
desperate to save himself he has no choice but to kill them
both

  if hed succeeded the danger would be removed and
hed be far afield by now i reasoned but since he didnt
actually kill the second sister he still doesnt know whether


argosy

or not shes the witness so instead of escaping hes
still trying-

ort bent over the girl she remained as still as
 before while he again searched her pockets finding
nothing he shook her the response was thoroughly nega-
tive he peered at me and i answered with a baffled gesture
toward the first-aid kit since the hospital at limon was
easily accessible under normal conditions the kit was in-
adequate for such an emergency as this and anyway
i was no medicine man

  she might be faking i said maybe shes scared
out of her wits and is trying to avoid further trouble by
playing possum like a little kid hiding under the bed-
covers it would be just like her but on the other hand
she might be seriously hurt if we try doctoring her our-
selves we might do the wrong thing and make her worse
she ought to be at the hospital getting her head x-rayed
meantime wed better leave her strictly alone

  cort was again peering out one of the bullet-holes
it spat at him viciously and i saw him grow tense he
spun about caught up his rifle signaled me to follow and
viquez to remain with tjie girl the teniente had a devil
of a fight getting the door closed again behind us

  cort and i forced ourselves out into the blasting torrent
which still had a good part of the scale to climb before
it would reach its height

  the rain came horizontally a roaring rapids and we
crept backward against it for to face it would probably
mean drowning as bert stebbins had drowned the visible
world extended only a few feet around us it flickered
like an old-time movie each breath and each step was
a struggle won

  the flowing air was cluttered with debris that flicked
past us giant banana fronds a whole uprooted criollo
tree to get struck by any sizable object would simply
mean getting whisked away with it never again to be seen

  when we reached the first hut we were crawling on
hands and knees there was scarcely any shelter inside
for the door was gone and just as we crept under the
roof half of it lifted off and soared away

  saw him going in here corts voice was almost lost
though he shouted with his lips at my ear had time
to get out again

  he pointed into a corner the box of dynamite was
no longer where we stored it a long coil of waterproof
fuse was also missing severalcharred wooden matches
were floating at our feet possibly they meant that taggart
had managed to light one end of the fuse and presently
would cut off a length of it as needed but as to where
and how taggart really meant to use the stuff we could
only guess

ort started out again there was an even chance
 that none of us would survive the hurricane but tag-
gart considered that the odds werent strong enough in his
favor dynamite would make certain stuffed under the
house for example it would leave nothing but trash to
be swept instantly away by the wind

  afterward there would be no indication whatever that
an explosive had really done the job the rending wind
and the cutting water would naturally be blamed taggart
need never worry that his guilt might catch up with him

  the dread that taggart was working at the house now
sent cort back we braced each other feeling ourselves

crawling along the slippery rim of hell itself a few mo-
ments casual stroll in normal weather it was today a
battle against a maelstrom on earth flinging ourselves
against the shaking wall of the house almost lost from
each other we crept from corner to corner

   there was no hint of taggarts presence until almost
completing the circuit we found the door crazily banging
the full force of the onslaught pouring into the house

  somehow we felt that esteban viquez was screaming
shouldering in the door we at first saw nothing of him
the darkness inside thick with rain blinded us the
floor wasswamped the whole house seemed to burst like
a toy balloon or about to be sucked whole into a thunder-
ing void

   abruptly i realized that cort was straddled rifle leveled
shooting into the wall of the bedroom where the girl lay
he sent the bullet drilling through at a level too high to
harm the girl but high enough to hit a man standing near
the bed if a man were in there

   taggart came out so swiftly that he was scarcely more
than a flitting phantom unhurt and springing around
the furniture piled in the center of the room he cracked
his gun against my temple at a moment when i was off
balance i went fiat striking my head again and lay there
beginning to drown

  then esteban viquez left arm was under my neck he
was holding my nose out of the dirty bubbling tide and
i saw cort grappling with taggart in a splashing welter

  taggart leaped up his hands empty his gun lost a
strip of his shirt ripped off in corts fist he ducked into
the slashing flow at the door and disappeared

   i found ftiy knees and viquez dragged himself behind
me toward cort we sidled out and made a circuit of the
house while clinging flat to the walls it was almost im-
possible to see and we found no new sign of taggart
no indication that the dynamite had been placed under
the house perhaps he haclcached it after stealing it from
the hut and we still couldnt know how he meant to use
it against us

   cort and viquez apd i had a little trouble finding the
door for on that side of the house there was no longer
a porch whileour attention was momentarily elsewhere
the wind had snatched it off

   finding the door torn loose the three of us slapped it
upright against the inside wall then slid it into position
it functioned like a closing valve while the teniente and
i held it cort piled furniture against it we scarcely
expected it to hold but it was holding-so far even
though the wind kept screaming outside and the water
kept lashing the room seemed almost quiet now

  esteban viquez both arms hung useless there was
a bullet in his right shoulder and another in his left bicep
and he looked sheepishly apologetic dizzy and gasping

i was finding it hard to keep my feet cort was still
moving with dogged purpose and i saw had stuffed the
section of taggarts shirt into his hip pocket

the girl had revived we noted this without surprise

   in a scheme of things which had no surprises left she
was sitting on the floor bracing herself against the wall
very pale her eyes blue and big we couldnt know how
long taggart had been within reach of her but corts rifle
bullet had driven him off so quickly that he hadnt had
a chance to kill her she simply sat there shivering but
strangely unafraid-too stunned i thought to feel fear-

                        -argosy-april - j 
blow cold blow hot



and stared at us she stared without saying a word

  the thunder of the storm was too great now so cort
didnt try to question her some of the water was leaking
out through the cracks of the floor disclosing the where-
abouts of viquez automatic and taggarts cort put one
into my hands making two for me and kept the other
we tried to listen to learn somehow if taggart now de-
prived of all but one weapon was cramming the dynamite
into the foundations somewhere

   cort watched the girl and we all prowled hoping that
some miracle would warn us if taggart had the dynamite
under the house

  perhaps this was as bad as the blow would get we
couldnt know for sure the house was a rather frail
structure and we were all aware that a hurricane can
drive water through a slab of solid concrete it was taking
such punishment that it might fly to pieces at any moment
a sea was running all around us and we were filled with
that complete hopelessness which is like no other hopeless-
ness in life there was nothing we could do about it but
cower and wait

   it was an emotional third degree and the three of us
were prowling like insane animals i saw cort gazing at
the girl with an incredulous smile and his lips forming
the words shes beautiful beautiful at first she had
seemed almost good-looking but now her beauty prac-
tically surpassed description we were all actually a little
crazy then yes this we hoped was the worst of it

   now the house was twisting it was as if the structure
were a flimsy berry-box under a gargantuans foot with
no audible sound of crackling or splitting it was being
crushed down upon us

   but the whim of the hurricane shifted the walls settled
at a leaning angle and the roof began to disappear bit
by bit swiftly one ragged section after another simply
vanished each in a flash until about one-third of it was
left the huddljng girl remained somewhat sheltered but
upon the rest of us the howling deluge poured

   then suddenly so suddenly that it came as a stupefying
shock there was no wind and no rain not the faintest
whisper of air stirred and all sound was gone it was an
utterly complete silence without a note of a birds song
or the hum of an insect the storm had stopped to draw
a fresh breath and the soundlessness crushed us even
while warning us that soon-no one could know how
soon-the whole show would start all over again

vi

for a moment we were perfectly motionless inside that
shell of a house and corts voice came like a strange
sound wed never heard before miss stebbins he said
are you all right

   miss stebbins sat on the floor still very pale her blue
eyes still big and did not answer

  are you miss sabina stebbins cort asked miss
sabina the one who saw taggart with van vreer

  if she understood the english language she gave no
indication of it to me she was like a willful child whose
cat had gotten her tongue her whole body was shivering
and it was strange that she seemed so self-possessed but
this i thought again was undoubtedly due to the fact
that she was in the same condition as a fighter who is
out on his feet too stunned to comprehend or answer
and really unaware of what was going on i judged she

simply sat there and stared at us it made me uneasy

  seeming astonished that he still possessed a voice him-
self esteban viquez explained i am so ashamed amigos
mios senor taggart burst in upon me with such a quick-
ness that i had scarcely the time required to raise my gun
he shot me only twice because he was in haste to reach
the senorita he was a little mad like the rest of us and
i felt that he would really like to be finished with his
killings if that were possible

  i saw him seize the girl and shout at her what is
your name are you sabina what is your name she
sat as she is sitting now and stared at him and uttered not
a sound if she is not senorita sabina but instead senorita
sarilla she might actually have saved herself by speaking
but she did not speak

  to taggarts way of looking at it we came in at exactly
the wrong time cort said his eyes still admiring and
puzzling over the silent girl we not only stopped him
from killing her but forced him to expose himself to us
for the first time now hell certainly have to kill all
four of us

  the girl must have heard this but she simply continued
to sit and watch us

  i was gazing around in blank wonder its the eye
of the hurricane i found myself mumbling the hole
in the doughnut of the storm this lull will last a few
hours at most or maybe a few minutes then well have
the wind again from the opposite direction

  of course i was telling cort and the teniente something
they already knew better than i this is just the inter-
mission between the acts

  cort glancing again at the girl was pulling the section
of taggarts shirt out of his pocket the ragged piece
contained a pocket of its own which was buttoned and
stuffed with something heavy it was a handkerchief
wrapped around a big handful of something that looked
like gravel cort and the teniente stared at it with under-
standing while i merely blinked

  uncut diamonds cort said broken out of van
vreers cast-bits of plaster still clinging to them

  van vreer was a smuggler i guessed was this a
tricky way of getting the diamonds into the states

cort wagged his head i dont think so the inva-
sion of holland wasnt entirely unexpected when
the nazis arrived they found empty vaults and tills an
evacuation of business and wealth had been secretly going
on for weeks the dutch are canny people theyd spirited
away their gold their securities the stocks of diamonds
in their cutting houses everything was scattered to
england to the states to batavia and these pebbles-
a fortune-are part of it

  van vreer was carrying them a roundabout way to
new offices set up in new york when he broke his leg
he took advantage of the plaster cast as a hiding place
taggarts shrewd hed read of this too and had figured
it all out the whole thing being so secret in nature hed
hgve gotten away with it if sabina stebbins hadnt un-
intentionally gummed up the works

   now to top off his troubles hes lost his loot i said
hell get it back if he can but if he has to blow it
to  points of the compass along with us hell do that
there will be a reward no doubt for the return of
these jewels said the teniente a large reward perhaps
sufficient to restore the plantation

                           -argosy-april -
argosy

   a fat chance we have of collecting it i said

   cort was rewrapping the diamonds stuffing them back
into his sodden pants he kneeled beside the girl took
one of her cold hands smiled perhaps i thought it was
a severe case of amensia she gazed at cort with calm
curiosity as he spoke

  are you sabina stebbins were your friends you
know we want to help you we must know which of
the two sisters you are are you sabina stebbins or
sarilla

  she said very quietly im sabina	

yiquez groaned and corts chin set not possibly
 i thought could the girl realize the full meaning of
what shed said in those two words shed told us that
her sister had been killed without reason and that her own
death was highly necessary to taggart calmer than any
of the rest of us she kept searching curiously into corts
eyes

   youre sabina he said youre the girl who saw a
red-headed man named taggart with your friend van vreer
last night

   yes she said

   cort turned to us decisively we cant stay here in
limon it will be much safer for miss sabina therell be
more protection and she needs medical care you also
need a bit of repairing at the hospital teniente were
starting out for limon

  youre crazy cort i protested the roads cer-
tainly blocked and probably entirely gone you know as
well as i do that the cardinal rule of how to behave
during a hurricane is never to go out during a lull a few
minutes or a few hours-nobody can tell when the second
half of it will start up we might have time to get to
limon somehow but the chances are much better that
we wont make it

   well never outlast it here cort answered either
the storm or taggart will get us were starting out for
limon right now

   he dragged the furniture away from the door and went
out a weird world spread before us every bush and
blade of grass was raked flat half the criollos were gone
the rest whipped to earth stumps of palms were all around
the trunks snapped off like matches dead fish blown
up from the sea were strewn about the yard and there
was one drowned crocodile

   the inexplicible vagaries of the wind had left some of
the blacks huts untouched their moaning chant was
rising again and the only other sound was the water
running down from the high places

   the tenientes car had disappeared the heavier truck
had been picked up and put down a hundred feet away
still on its wheels rusty water was dripping from it
everywhere particularly from its nose the grill was punc-
tured taggart had put rtiore bullets into the radiator

   even if itll go elven if the roads clear the bearings
will burn out in a fety miles cort i said were crazy
to try to get to limon

  but we were going cort dragged the stebbins trunks
from the truck tossed the bags out kicked the absurd
gourds into a corner coming back he put cartridges
for the enfield into his pocket our supply of them was
almost exhausted-there were only half a dozen left-but
of shotgun shells we had an abundance he loaded my
arm with boxes of them and i put them in the truck he

added the first-aid kit i thought he was still a little
daffy from the wind

  we wiped off the spark plugs and tried the engine the
battery was weak its charge was probably leaking off
through the salt water on it or its solution was diluted
when it was about to die the motor coughed a few
minutes more and the battery was entirely gone

  cort used the crank in this completely crazy world
we finally got the engine going probably however it
would sneeze off at any moment because of water blown
in through the tiny vent of the petrol tank

  miss stebbins responded obediently when cort took her
hand drenched and still shivering she allowed him to
wrap a blanket around her hed managed to find a
reasonably dry one deep inside a chest he carried her
to the truck put in a comfortable sitting position inside
then helped the teniente in beside her gazing at his travel-
ing companion and thinking very sadly of her future
estaban viquez said ah-h ah-h

  his rifle looking for taggart over the tailgate cort
joined them i took the wheel we were off for limon
off on a direct highway to seven varieties of hell

a lmost at once we met an obstruction an uprooted
coco palm lay straight across the road we climbed
out keeping an eye peeled for taggart and managed
to drag it far enough aside so that i could crowd the
wheels past a few yards farther on there was another
again we were able to shift it

  i anticipated that the whole length of the road would
be barricaded in this way but the next stretch was pleas-
antly long still even the open stretches were hard going
the rushing water had turned the ruts into deep gashes
the differential bumped the sump scraped and the motor
was rapidly reaching the point where its own heat would
disable it

  you see miss sabina cort said practically all we
have left of the plantation is the land everything else
is wiped out it means a new beginning a long pull itll
be a heartbreaking job and once we start it youll learn
that therell be no time for writing a diary let alone
detailed reports of daily progress

  the girl said nothing under the circumstances i felt
cort was being a bit overly optimistic as to our prospects
personally i had no expectations of ever planting another
criollo

  it isnt the physical labor that gets you he went on
explaining to the wordless miss stebbins the blacks
do all of that its the climate and everything that goes
with it that wear you down keeping your plants alive
and healthy is a moral issue when a seedling dies you
feel youve lost a member of your family when the wind
breaks up a tree you wish it had been one of your own
limbs instead everything conspires to break your body
and soul if you let it it will since all this is so strange
to you miss stebbins i think you must ask yourself at
the very beginning whether you can take it

  miss stebbins spoke again adding to the three words
she had so far uttered youll see she said

  there was more debris to be cleared away cort had
to help push us out of a transverse gully that hadnt been
there before the hot motor was crackling we now came
to a long slow curve down which we could coast i eyed
the terrain on the right-a rolling jungle of broken tree
stumps and fallen trunks an entanglement offering ex-

                            -argosy-april -
i		 - 

blow cold blow hot

cellent shelter to an attacker i saw with apprehension

   it was not far from the plantation by short-cutting
 across taggart might already have hidden himself in it
 the thought was no sooner in my mind than the real
 danger materialized

   something twirled through the air something that looked
 like a short rod with a few inches of rope attached it
 landed in the road sixty feet ahead and lay there sputtering

   howling an incoherent warning i jammed on the brakes
 the linings were saturated with water slippery the mois-
 ture acted as a lubricant with the brakes hard on we
 rolled down the slope with unslackened speed i tried
 crazily to get into reverse gear and couldnt it seemed
 impossible that we should be very far from the dynamite
 when it let go and very possibly wed be directly over it

   cort was scrambling out hustling the girl over the tail-
 gate the teniente unable to use his arms heaved himself
 upon his knees and simply fell out head first i left the
 wheelwith a leap the four of us were tumbling like
 tenpins at the moment the dynamite exploded

vii

 the concussion seemed not too violent compared with
 the half of a hurricane wed just been through chok-
 ing smoke rolled over us earth and rocks pelted down
 when we raised our heads at last we found that the truck
 had stopped with its nose deep in a crater

   cort was up at once heading into the shattered bush
 there were scrambling noises beyond indicating tag-
 garts retreat we glimpsed him once for an instant hug-
 ging a bundle of dynamite under one arm the fuse coiled
 over one shoulder cort with the tenientes automatic
 i with taggarts and corts luger blasted at every flicker
 of motion

   taggart seemed to have been swallowed up in the con-
 fusion f splintered trunks and stumps holed in some-
 where he was waiting for us to exhaust our ammunition

   there arent many bullets left in either of these guns
 i said as we backed to the road corts luger was almost
 empty too i knew guns arent much good anyway when
 you cant find anything to draw a bead on he can sneak
 up behind these woodpiles and sling his dynamite without
 showing so much as a hair

   we cant go ahead on foot cort said his eyes alert
 miss sabinas too weak for that and viquez is in bad
 shape taggart could follow us and besides we wouldnt
 stand a chance in the open when the wind hits again the
 trucks the best shelter within reach well have to stay
 inside it

   the girl was hewing the teniente into the truck he was
 feeling the shock of his wounds and he sagged out flat
 on his back the next time a stick of dynamite came our
 way he wouldnt be able to get out of its vicinity for
 one of us to attempt to move him would probably be fatal
 to both	

  without the danger of taggart we might worm the
truck out of the crater and even with its motor melting to
pieces reach limon eventually but as it was we couldnt
avoid offering him a hulking target our immediate prob-
lem was to keep him beyond throwing range and since
the tangle of the jungle overlapped the edge of the road
offering taggart a hundred merging entrenchments it
looked like a tall order

   cort handed me the scott and a box of shells



  perch up top of the cab mac and blast away at any-
thing that might be a man

  he boosted me up the position offered practically no
advantage the tangle all around was chaotic if the lull
held out i could regard any moving thing as a legitimate
target but already the air was beginning to swirl a little
there was a confusion of stirrings any one of which might
be taggart i kept hammering at as many as i could
first one barrel then the other promptly reloading

  when the box of shells was empty i asked for another
cort handed one up and i resumed the capnonade not
knowing whether i was coming anywhere near taggart

  something was going on inside the truck i heard a
brittle scraping sound and the girl asked may i help
the teniente was watching whatever cort was doing and
mumbled i have a knife senorita the queer noises
went on including a hollow rattle concerned with keep-
ing my eyes on the jungle and my gun hot i asked for and
got a third carton of shells presently i called down that
i could use a fourth

  thats all mac cort said

  all i blurted we have at least a dozen more boxes
as soon as i stop shooting taggart will creep up

  let him come

  understanding none of this except that cort was some-
how inviting the attack id been trying my best to stave
off i dropped down he was busy at a strange job

hed dragged the stebbins collection of decorated
gourds into the center of the floor hed cut a small
hole in one of them much as youd plug a watermelon
hed also hacked up all the rest of our shotgun shells
pouring the powder and shot into the gourd he dropped
the brass cap in after it

  the girl using the tenientes knife was aiding him and
now the gourd was full taking a roll of adhesive tape
from the first-aid kit he sealed the opening i realized
then that he had treated half a dozen other gourds in this
same manner he put two of them into my hands stuffed
two partway into his pockets and was about to take up
the last pair when the girl seized them

  use your automatics mac to drive him back a little
cort said while i stared at him as if hed really gone mad
place these gourds at scattered points where they can
all be seen from the truck but not seen by taggart
perhaps youd better give me those miss stebbins youre
scarcely equal to-

  i can do it miss stebbins said

  there was still no sign of taggart cort and i fired
at random as we twisted our way into the tangle miss
stebbins moved between us with a certain doggedness
the wind was quickening with the continued movement
of the hurricane as a whole and very soon we would again
be in the thick of it when we had struggled ahead about
two hundred feet cort signaled a halt his luger was
empty now and so were both the automatics i had

  cort placed one of his gourds on a stump twenty
yards toward one side i put another on a mound miss
stebbins placed hers against a log nearby retreating
watching for the warning flicker of a missile twirling
through the air cort and i placed our last gourds nearer
the road the six positions roughly formed an arc corts
idea i judged was to mine the bush against taggarts
approach though i could see no way of igniting the make-
shift bombs

  back in the road cort helped the girl inside the truck
and took up his enfield it was the only useful firearm
he had left and we had at most half a dozen cartridges

  taggart remained as invisible and elusive as before
though we were still certain he was still somewhere near
the fact that we were no longer firing would invite him
to creep closer another single stick of dynamite tossed
with reasonably good aim and with a five-second fuse
would finish his job for- him

  cort crouched inside the truck at the tail-gate one of
those precious cartridges in the breech of the enfield
he watched the jungle which was darkening and stirring
more fitfully now and the rifle was cocked

  miss stebbins became unexpectedly articulate

  mr cormick she said soberly i have a confession
to make two of them in fact

  his gaze still sweeping in all points at which taggert
might show cort answered yes miss stebbins

  mr macomber was right about me i was playing
possum part of the time i recovered consciousness shortly
after you brought me to the house

  i stared at her iniasperation and did you do it for
the reason i said-because you were afraid

  i was afraid but that wasnt the real reason miss
stebbins answered you see that note made me sus-
picious i reasoned that if you thought i was unconscious
id perhaps learn the truth about you and i did of
course i know now that the note was nothing but false-
hoods and i began to see your side of the problems of
maintaining a plantation

  youd very soon have learned all about them anyway
i assured her i hope youre more or less satisfied now tht
cort and i are not a couple of indolent incompetents
im quite sure miss stebbins said

ort lifted the rifle hesitated lowered it again the
wind was coming when it struck this time there
wouldnt be any such gradual buildup as before wed get
the full power of it almost at once it was growing darker
which was giving taggart a greater advantage cort kept
the rifle ready and watched

  the other confession i have to make miss stebbins
said quietly is that im not really sabina

  the startled teniente raised his head my jaw dropped
and cort gave her a quick searching glance

  youre not what i snapped

  im not sabina she explained im really sarilla
youre not the girl whos an eye-witness against tag-
gart then i blurted

  no im not

  viquez moaned and dropped his head cort very still
had a faint smile tugging at the corners of his mouth
my own reaction was not so restrained

  do you realize what youve done i snapped at the
girl if taggart had learned about this in some way at
the very beginning hed never have come after you by
pretending to be unconscious or speechless you provoked
him to these attacks its far too late now but there in
the house when taggart in his desperation demanded to
know your name- do you remember what the teniente
said about that she might actually have saved herself
by speaking but she did not speak good lord miss
stebbins didnt you realize what you were doing

  i think i did mr macomber she said

  then why in the name of heaven didnt you let the

news get back to taggart in the first place which would
have prevented all this

  because hed murdered my sister because hed also
damaged the plantation and would do it again because
hed have gotten away with it unless something kept him
within reach the only hope of bringing punishment upon
was to let him go one believing i was the girl he must
kill

  at that instant corts rifle lifted in the darkening
shaking snare of the jungle i saw the same furtive move-
ment that had caught his eyes it was already gone
taggart had shifted to a closer position hed come near
enough so that he could easily toss more dynamite at the
truck with small chance of missing down now behind
a pile of stumps and logs he was beyond the reach of
even the enfields powerful bullets

  but it wasnt toward taggarts probable position that
cort was aiming his sights were lined up on one of the
gourds

hphe rifle cracked and its repeated sound set off a series
of blasts like a string of firecrackers bigger than was
ever made there was a shattering explosion among the
fallen trees then another thirty yards away then a third
behind and between these two

  with the shocks the realization came to me of how cort
had planned it the bullets drilling into the gourds were
almost certain to strike one of the percussion caps of the
many shells he had crowded into each the closely crammed
powder ignited in this way each of the hitherto silly gourds
became a deadly shrapnel bomb

  but their thunderclaps were not all of it there was
a fourth blast even more powerful at a position where we
had planted none of the gourds i felt the cold certainty
that something had vanished from existence there amid
the smoke and i remembered that taggart had been
carrying perhaps a dozen sticks of our dynamite under
one arm

   then as if corts rifle were a signal gun starting an end-
less series of eruptions the hurricane hit again

  suddenly it was all around us-the horizontally sheet-
ing rain the debris flashing past the deep drums in the
sky and the fiendish whine wehuddled deep in the truck
rocked and whipped and soaked i thought that perhaps
the truck would stay there that the water would eat
away the crater until it was a wider hole from which
we could crawl if this second half of the blow was no
worse than the first wed be able to ride it out and
eventually get to limon

  but this hopeful speculation was cut short when seeing
miss stebbins huddling close to cort i felt my anger
surged up again

  you asked taggart to try to kill you and its not his
fault he didnt oblige you i yelled at her you were
crazy deliberately taking a chance like that

  cort was smiling and deep among the wet blankets
his hand was closed over sarilla stebbins

  but she accomplished what she meant to do mac and
it took both brains and courage he said speaking as
we were of having what it takes sarilla has demonstrated
that shes completely equipped we didnt see it at the
time but from the very beginning she showed it-even
in her letters

  esteban viquez brown face lifted and grinning his
broadest sighed silently but happily ah-h

nobody but mase mckay would talk back to an octopus on the ocean floor-or offer a
drink to a deep-water ghost

  by charles tenney jackson

author of buryin pants hold that bull etc

little bill shank met mase mckay at the over-
seas highway bridge with the message from big
bill the charterboat captain owner of the lulu
jane mase saw holes in the story at once but he didnt
mention them to the skippers kid little bill was trying
to get around something without exactly lying about it

  the old mans got a trip out-three fellers that want a
try for sailfish he brought em around from key west
and now hes took sick but he needs that money and he
said that maybe youd take this party out today him bein
so sick

  yeah said mase big bill sick now boy i aint no
sailfish guide im a hand tfiat wants action not baitin
hundred dollar tackle and warmin coffee fer any tourist
bunch sick eh

  he didnt tell little bill that his dad hadnt acted sick
last night at the inlet beer joint after hed brought the
lulu jane in bill shank had been disturbed uneasy star-

ing at mase as if he wanted to talk and had reasons not to

  mase was all set to go back to his deep glades home on
jigger key this morning but now hecould use a piece of
shanks charterboat money whapwith a few dice machines
and poker hands at the inlet	

  the only thing was that bill hadnt acted sick then
and he wasnt an owner whod let such a trim craft as the
lulu go out in the charge of a wild guy like mase mckay
then too this key west charter party had spent the
night on the boat at the bridge dock instead of turning up
at the inlet inn beer festivities where all good eggs would
gather after a day out on the gulf stream

  they was all in little bill explained didnt strike a
sail and got all burned and sore but they want to go out
again today dad said it was ten for you and hed furnish
everything he said take these folks where they want and
show em a good time

  that ten bucks is the only good time i see in it mase
grinned now its furiny about bill i better go talk to
him about it he knows im not licensed fer anything but
a seminole dugout even if i do know boats its out my
territory

he knew it he said nothind be said about it this

party takes care of it they got big money but you cant
see the old man for hes gone to florida city to see a
doctor

  yeah saifl mase and he left it to you kid musta
been sure sick of somethin he didnt like well mebbe i
will

  he stood up the inlet counter man for two cups of coffee
and hot cakes borrowed a dollar at the filling station rolled
a cigarette and strolled down to the bridge dock

  westward from the inlet and the coastal mangrove keys
the channel straggled into big grass country and it was no
spot for sailfish it was no spot for a booze party nor
women nothin like that and mase figured that was what
bill shank had got into maybe thered been a fight on
board some kind of rookus that a local owner didnt want
to be mixed in but couldnt afford to squawk about to the
charter party

  some them tourist guys jest take big-game fishin fer
a chance to cut up out where nobody knows or cares-if
they square the skipper mase thought bills got a party
he cant afford to drop an i can handle a bunch o souses
he thinks only its funny hed let anybody handle his boat
he sure is proud an careful o the lulu jane

till shanks lulu looked bright and trim as ever

    the iron pulpit was fixed on the extreme bow where
sometimes parties tried their hands at harpooning pur-
poise when theyd tired of drifting for gamefish from the
two swivel seats in the cockpit gear and rods all stowed
the roomy cabin neat the decks shipshape

  mase had expected hed first have to  clean up but the
lulu didnt look like shed got in late from a day with sail-
fish the two guests aboard were having a quiet drink
when they sw him coming one was a sort of sickly man
dark and thin but hardfaced the other was big and blond-
ish and no sunburn on him at all they looked up quickly
from their low-toned talk and the thin man waved a hand

  youre the new guide

  my gineral reputation is guidin myself into grief
mase grinned but i can git around bill left it to me
ready to start

  right sooner the better no luck yesterday shank
met us at key west and took us over to what he called
stranglers cut

  hell said mase that aint sailfish water bill
knows it

  well said the thin mn laughing we didnt care
just drifting around in those channels my names devlin
this is doc steger he never got a big fish strike in his life
its his party	

  steger didnt look comfortable he was big and hearty
but there were puffs under his eyes as if he hadnt slept
well he smiled evasively i get a sailfish today or else
im through

  tnot in strangler cut its all coral ridges and shoals
wheres your other party shank said there were three
is he ready to go out

  steger looked startled devlins eyes narrowed and he
forced a laughhe quit us last night jones couldnt
stand the rolling outside maybe he got a bit sore at us
ribbing him about his fishing danny was a good egg but
not on salt water he took the late bus to miami well
have a get together with him at the club bali tomorrow

  old danny jones said steger davys brother he
shouldnt have been out on this after a week of havana
we all came up from there but game fishing dont help a
hangover hell feel better now

  have a drink mckay said devlin carelessly and
they passed up davy jones brother we wanlj to run
back to stranglers cut

      --si mka	

  strangler grunted mase and he turned from the
motor tryout it aint game-fish water sharks and bar-
racuda feedin the tides through the coral okay we can
go through the pass to deeper water im no game-fish
guide but i know the shore channels and bays west

  he gauged the gas started the engine idled it and cast
off the moorings at his last glimpse of the bridge dock he
saw little bill shank staring after his fathers boat with a
wild look under his freckles mase waved good hardy
coast kid was little bill

  he held the wheel until they cleared the mangrove
points and mud bottoms and the last channel marks gave
out there were ways through the sandy shoals if a man
knew them when the deeper blue showed good water
mase gave the wheel to devlin

  steger said he didnt know a thing about boats and
didnt want to by noon he had had several drinks but
they made him more moody and he watched the shoals
passes to the sea in a sort of haunted absent-mindedness

  mase busied himself in the little galley with a look over-
side now and then to see where devlin was holding the
throb of the screw told him of the bottom but devlin was
following the blue smoothly

  mase rigged the table set out the bread and cofi e and
canned chow and called his guests hed take the helm
while they ate then he noticed an unwieldy burlap-
wrapped package by one of the narrow berths forward
metal shone and he pulled the wrapping aside

  it was a battered copper diving helmet with the lines
and hand air-pump he remembered that bill shank used
to gather fancy coral between seasons and mount it for
curio dealers but bill hadnt walked on the bottom for
two seasons or more

tvtase went up and took the wheel the dim mangrove
---- islets were far to the north and the offshore shoals
would be tricky along ahead

  i guess you better handle her said devlin when
youre abreast the cut let me know we got some figuring
to do

  sandy bottom in there but coral ridges on each side
big weed and sea growth along em at low tide a few out-
crops show you aim to look at them sea gardens a glass-
bottom bucketll show you all but you got shanks divin
gear patched up and laid out goin touse it i never
thought it was game fish you was interested in devlin

  no but i fixed all this with shank dont know why
he quite the job so sudden he knew what we wanted
the thing is mckay that yesterday when we were coming
through stranglers cut steger and me ribbin each other
with a drink aboard steger lost his wallet

  hed cleaned up at the havana casino had about
thirty grand and a lot of papers he cant afford to lose
and the junk went out of his pocket over the stern when
shank made a sharp turn it broke stege all up thats
whats getting him down now

  how do you mean to find it--the sand driftin in the
tide since yesterday and no landmarks to fetch said
mase incredulously

  i got marks thats me mckay-quick on the old fix
i threw two bottles of scotch in the channel on open sand
not four fathoms down i reasoned you can pick them
up easy on the white sand and then somewhere within
forty yards of em stegers dough is lying shank said any-
body could walk bottom along that ledge and pick it up

  yeah said mase a good diverd make it without any
helmet if he knew just where to hit but if he had to work
around-

  thats it devlin grinned he likely would lucky for
us shank had the outfit

                               -argosy-april -
davy jones brother



  ill look the pump an airline over mase said whos
goin down what im intrested in is them two bottles o
scotch must been full or theyd drift you aim to fetch
em up a big barraculda playin round a guys legs he
can be mean with a skinful o hootch

  barracuda said steger thoughtfully ive heard of
them

  devlin broke in quickly theyre nothing mckay
youre a live guy i see i like your line sure the scotch
is yours-and a case more

  i been down once off whitefish bay about the same
water too

  stegers going down said devlinagain quickly his
job let the liquor go mckay gets plenty along with a
bonus if were right

  that divin i did was on a rummy that broke in two i
was shore a hand at salvaging that stuff barracudas-
hell i shoved em about till they weakened there was a
big shark thought hed interfere till he saw it was me he
laid off then

  devlin started to laugh but steger muttered shark
they dont bother unless theyre hungry or git a blood
scent

  steger said quickly blood that brings em about
devlin snarled at him say are you listenin to him-
or me i cant go down on account of my heart but any
kid can dive in four fathoms

  steger was staring seaward a faint line of white marked
distant reefs how far now to strangler he asked slowly

  two hours run mase said you guys eat then me
then well be pickin up shoal points i know got to keep
inside and turn em fer the pass

  youll take the wheel then devlin whispered to mase
as steger went below here cut that shark stuff out
that guys losing his nerve

  you handle the airline and ill walk bottom for your
wallet

no said devlin steger handles it its his anyhow
he went to dinner and mase heard them conferring
devlin snarled steger lost his temper once and then the
talk ceased obviously they were afraid mase would hear
there were some angles to this job a guide wasnt to know

mase held the wheel in the bright frng afternoon
tide and figured on it those birds wanted to get their
hands on that stuff first they didnt want him to handle
it at all why couldnt they trust him he couldnt rook
em they both had guns and mase would be dolled up in a
copper hat overside he didnt see it at all

  they finished the meal and came up steers nervous
eyes went to the submerged shoals now shoing to port
ahead devlin took the wheel but mase saw jiis narrow
eyes watching the sea line covertly

  mase thought more while he ate whod they expect
coming down strangler from outside patrol planes cov-
ered the shore all along but the coast guard knew all the
charter craft and theyd not be covering the lulu jane
a cutter couldnt get down strangler anyhow and why
hadnt these two guys let shank recover this supposed wal-
let maybe it had been dark then

  devlin brought up the old battered copper helmet and
lines he dumped them in the cockpit and took the wheel
look em over boy shank inspected em once but i dont
want steger to get more nervous

   i could fetch that thing up on a straight dive if i knew
where it was exactly

  sure but you dont got to poke along carefully by
the weeds on that coral shelf thats the hell of it i saw
it go

  then it wasnt after dark mase thought they saw

  it go-whatever it was-and they didnt tell shank theyd
lost anything now they didnt want anything known-
right then they let shank bring em to the inlet and then
they told him theyd lost thirty grand off his boat

  dont make sense no wonder shank laid off he didnt
believe em yet they had somethin over bill shank
somehow or hed notve trusted his little lulu to me
shank got good money but he was scared of something
too what was it two havana gamblers aint so hot i
can take em to joints in miami where theyd lose their
pants

  devlin was laying out the lines and inspecting each foot
carefully steger leaned over masesshoulder at the mid-
ships helm and stared ahead over the cabin top you see
strangler yet  v
the big coral wall begins a mile on it runs to strangler
and turns you hardly see a difference calm as it is on
this tide

  rough along there and you couldnt go over could
you

 couldnt see much maybe well have the right sun
slant for it

  i saw sharks there when we came in said steger i
saw-theres dark holes along there caves shank said in
the reef wall 

  yeah pot holes feller wouldnt want to step in em
might have to club a octopus off his neck mostly little
ones jest curious

  devilfish said steger stranglers a hunting ground
for the bad fish isnt it chase mullet through the cut
from deep water

  yeah but no sailfish come in the deep-water babies re
outside so i thought it was funny you guys cornin back
to strangler lost wallet

  yes saidger and he saw the first underwater
shadows of the gray coral-streamers waving over darker
patches steger laughed forcedly man wouldnt last
long there would he i mean those sea wolvesd finish him
quick

  not if they had live mullet first sharks are particular
and suspicious if one comes near you nail him first with a
gad on the nose jest blood makes em crazy to attack
blood muttered steger why bring that up
devlin came to them he watched the mouth of the sea
pass he looked at the sun how about a highball he
said mckay we better watch close slow down and watch
that coral line a mile along here-

  mase swerved the boat and grinned shark i put his
ears down and boy he went he looked at stegers tight
face devlins was tighter and grim he swore at both of
them

  what the helpre you doing put the heat on steger
sharks nothing

  the water was clear as glass alongside now the white
sandy floor stretched to the plume-nodding coral wall in
spots the wall came nearly to the surface and the sea forest
trailed above

  steger almost forgot his tension for a moment looking
at that he said quite a sight

  mase grunted theres a cave you can tell em by
bones scattered about the octopuses drag fish in and eat
em a guy can walk around them spots even a poor fish
knows they keep away from holes-notice

  this stuff wont be in any hole said devlin harshly
i know where it went i saw it sail down saw it hit the
sand then i started to mark it with the bottles i threw
three before i told shank it was about sunset he said
we couldnt do a thing last night

  yeah well we got plenty light if we start now
watch for marks

                                 -argosy-april -


argosy

sure enough in ten silent minutes mase saw an object
out on the white sand some twenty-five feet below a
stout bottle neck standing up like a buoy

  devlin grinned i told you steger didnt i your dough
is along here not a hundred feet inside the cut maybe we
can spot it

  mase went forward dropped the light hook over let the
boat come about on the uptide they were anchored not
twenty feet away from the coral ledge where only the clean
sand shelved as clear and smooth as a swept street but
steger didnt look at it he stared up strangler cut fas-
cinated

devlin barked at him come to earth the jobs here 
shark grunted mase watch him come to supper
the silvery mullet were boiling leaping they fled past
the boat and the gray raider loomed rushing like a torpedo

  nothin to worry about mase said kick em under
the chin if they come near sharks dont jump anything
that fights back kinda yella rats

  he looked at his guests they both stared up the
sea pass as if that silent brimming tide held hopes or terror
for them devlin broke the silence by cursing to himself
steger took a drink

  mase waited these boys had never dived deeper than
a broadway gutter on new years eve but they had to
do it steger grinned feebly at mase

youve been down havent you for sponge and stuff
ive had my ears wet since i was seven but it aint
divin we do walkin bottom for fan coral and such im
no sponge man though we better get busy while we got
sun along those potholes

  right said devlin theres the second bottle marker
if i hadnt thought of that wed never have this lay easy
for us id go down if my heart was right if i passed out
id never find it and youd have to haul me up and pump
water out of me come on stege

  mase got the big helmet all you got to do is step off
the ladder and drop on the bottom its damn pretty
youll see flowers and fish you cant up here its easy
nothing to stop you on this hard bottom sand ill tend the
air devlin can watch ahead

  what for said steger surlily but he got over the
short ladder from the stern transom stood there gingerly
in shorts and singlet while mase slowly dropped the helmet
over his ears mase grinned in the glass front steger was
sweating popeyed devlin did watch up the pass absorbed-
ly then he muttered low to mase
see something is that a shark gods sake dont let
steger know see that-its slow-not a shark eh
steger cant hear under that copper hat thats nothin
up there but brain coral round like a-well it aint no
shark hey

  he tapped the glass took another look at steger all
set let go the rungs youll drop like a feather

  steger lowered himself his legs were free then the
helmet was under and he could look about suddenly his
arms threshed wildly he grabbed the ladder andcame
butting up the stern bumping the wood

  yeah said mase sure theres a shark little one
what the-

  he let go of the air-pump and grabbed steger the man
was fighting to get the helmet from his shoulders mase
hauled him half over the stern and pulled the gear from
his head steger was pop-eyed and shivering devlin was
staring at him queerly silent

  whats the matter asked mase a little three-foot
shark aint nothin now listen you guys dont take me
serious any feller that knows mell say i aint to be took
serious-not even fightin ferget them sharks and barra-
cuda an octopuses i ribbed you about

  you can have em  yelled steger not for me again
he turned on devlin viciously you hear not for a
millioil

  what did you see said devlin curtly but oddly quiet
again

  mase dropped the helmet and laughed look here
you couldnt git in trouble down there why devlin an me
can watch you every minute we can see any fool fish that
comes near you on the sand waters clear as glass he
looked up the cut but it wont be an hour from now
little breezell kick the top up and the tidell fill an scour
sand mebbe if you guys are goin down you better start
now

  steger got up and paced the cockpit fuming and curs-
ing not me not ever i saw-

  a damn little shark grunted devlin mase apd me
both saw it from the top you never touched bottom didnt
go near the weeds

  it was a big one retorted steger over the ledge in
the weed stuff waiting i saw him-waiting

  mase eyed the two the coral ridge arose only a few
feet higher than the white sandy channel bottom the
marine growth and holes made it harder to see in detail
but thered been no shark in that stuff steger had just lost
his nerve and wanted an excuse for not walking the bottom
but his panic was real

  devlin sat down and lit a cigarette studying the silent
pass and the sky mckay he muttered i guess you
got to go down i dont want you mixed in this thing
salvaging that stuff was just nobodys business but ours
however youre in and you think its funny we havent
any particular terms with you yet but count five hundred
bucks if you find stegers wallet and dont talk about the
job-not for a good while yet anyhow a few months and
it wont matter

  mase grinned ever since they got into stranglers cut
hed been anxious to walk that bottom just out of curiosity
hed wanted to scare steger out of it steger took a drink
ahd he sat down his face twitching

  scared devlin sneered a baby job and you quit

  steger glowered savagely and said nothing

  mase grinned again okay by me five hundreds a lot
o brass to a glades cracker an as fer talkin about this
thing at home-folks wouldnt believe me anyhow bluff
an brag-thats jigger keys opinion o me i can tell em
anything an theyll say its jest mase mckay pipin off
if i showed em five hundred bucks theyd say it was
phony

   devlin laughed mirthlessly and looked at the sinking sun

  its got to be you he said show me how to handle
the airline and pump the pressure i mean and the signal
line

   nothin to it at this depth i could cast off an come up
without shanks copper bonnet if i liked to

devlin nodded at instructions then mase slid over
the stern stood on the swinging ladder and told devlin
how to lower the helmet over his head devlin fitted the
rubber rim neatly and grinned into the front glass

  mase dropped away waving a three-foot length of small
pipe-his shark tickler he called it he came to the hard
bottom easily stood a minute in a yellowish green world
listening to the slow pulse of the air feeling the slight throb
of his ears adjusting to pressure then he looked about
slowly

  a beautiful world of silence the sun glow shot broad
bands of paling yellow from the broken clouds of the west
and below they turned the coral terrace into fairyland the
ancient rock was grown with newer living coral delicate
fans and traceries fragile as flowers

  brilliant little fish banded red and blue stole in and
out among the anemones and the green plumes waving gent-
ly in the tide mase went closer looked up the ridge and
there was devlins bottle of scotch but a guy couldnt
get a drink with shanks copper hat down over his ears
and chin

  but im takin it up when i go mase muttered dev-
lin was smart to toss them bottles if the wallet went down
one  the potholes it aint so nice hey you-move on

  the first darker space-a cavern in the rock half below
the sand floor-was halfrhidden by the plumy growth above
it but he saw the octopus moving back from the rim mase
dragged nearer and shoved his pipe at the two-foot body
behind the squirming tentacles it vanished in the cave
with a cloud of inky stuff drifting up

  lay off that said mase dont bother me an i let
you alone

  he began searching along the foot of the coral under
the overhanging sea growth out on the sand hed have
spotted the wallet as easily as a man could the scotch mark-
ers he could see the red bottom of the lulu jane above
with his lines trailing to her stern and even the blur which
would be devlin working the pump

  mase didnt want to go up this was something to tell
about at jigger key pretty easy money if he found that
dough of stegers

  then he stopped hell there it was easy as that on
the sand at the foot of the coral hardly hidden by the sea
plumes mase went near rubbed his ribs and eyed the find
a fair-sized wallet and you could almost read the gold
lettering on its leather back bending over he made out the
initials daj

  mase grunted they werent stegers initials or devlins

  mase leaned on his iron gad and looked at the wallet
critically he thought that maybe before he retrieved that
package of dough hed better recover devlins scotch in
case of shock a guy might need it in fact just reading the
label through the thick glass of his helmet would help it
would strengthen him to go up and break the news that
this couldnt be stegers wallet

  so he got them both-the bottle first

  jones mase grunted they had a line about jones
who got seasick and quit em d jones-davys brother
now thats the reason devlin didnt want me to go below
and see the thing they didnt tell me all the truth and
im a guy who feels pained when he aint told truth hey
you 

  he rolled toward the rock ledge and waved his gad at a
five-foot tiger shark which came nosing along the sea flow-
ers the brute slid away suspiciously and mase picked
up the wallet hardly a drift of sand on it clean as new
perhaps slightly water-swollen

  if this aint easy five hundred bucks to earn then i
never gamble agin all i do is do nothin hand this to
devlin and act as if i never saw nothin funny yeah
but-

  he looked at the edge of the billfold and there was a
thin cloud-yellowish red-floating from it you wouldnt
say it was a blood trace but a guy down twenty-five feet
under the sea with two guns above him isnt going to ask
fool questions mase stuck the wallet between his knife belt
and his ribs looked at his bottle of scotch and sighed go
up nd laugh it off thatll all he could do

  he heard the air hissing softly from the line and his ears
were a little tight then he took a last look up stranglers
cut

  nightfall was deepening the bluer distance and the
plumey reef wall cast shadows out on the white sand and
down these bars of shade and sunlight past the sea forest a
man was walking

titase didnt believe it he even rubbed the bottle of
scotch across the copper plate under his nose absent-
ly yeah a man was walking bottom it sure was funny
he didnt walk so well youd think he was soused the way
he wobbled and reeled in the slow tide sea growth clung
to him but he came head up touched the rock where a
point stuck out hesitated and then turned about and came
gently on

  jones mase grunted damn if it aint hey you
keep on yore way i dont aim to tangle with no drowned
folks i got yore money jones and theys been blood on it
you made yore last bet so keep goin

  the dead mans feet hardly touched the sand hed
have gone to the top belly up but the drifting sea growth
checked him he came around the rock point dancing
slowly in the tide and stopped his distorted head showed
as the swollen body turned and he peered at mase mckay
over the green plumes his mouth was open grinning hor-
ribly and his eyes bulged and fijmed mase would have
liked to rub the back of his head to keep his hair from
rising

  that corpse was ready to rise and if mase stirred the
weeds about him he would rise mase thought to face
devlin and steger

  man mase muttered youll git me in a bad spot i
dont put nothin past them guys above they might send
me down to stroll with you if they knew id met you you
stay here

  the dead man rocked gently in the tide mase waved his
bottle of scotch he was afraid to move to signal for
devlin to draw him up the suction would pull the
murdered man right up past mases ears

  yeah an youd beat me up too the way you look an
grin at em now listen brother this heres a big ocean
but it aint big enough for two of us one of us is goin to git
out-an its me

  the dead man swung slowly and mase saw his swollen
neck it was a pale-ridged gash from ear to spine knifed
mase thought theyd put it to him and tossed him from
the stern o the lulu jane yesterday bill shank had been
at his wheel or motor and hadnt seen it but bill had
known he started out with three passengers and only two
had stepped ashore at the inlet they must have told bill
some lie but hed been scared

  mase mckay was scared too but didnt know what to
do about it not scared of d jones but of jones pals sit-
ting snug above on the lulu jane if they should happen
to look below carefully they might notice things they
might cut mases airline and start that motor

  it aint no place to fire a guy off his job down at the
bottom of this here ocean mase thought i got to go
above an hand devlin some kiddin line to show i never
saw nothin thats why him an steger kept lookin up
the cut today-this here killin on their minds hey
jones you drift on past i dont wanna be found with
you

  old d jones bobbed about maybe he wanted his dough
maybe he was trying to show mase that slash in his throat
tiny angel fish spots of red and blue and yellow swam
about his face a little grouper nibbled his nose they
hadnt started to work on jones yet the crabs would be
first when jones got through his wandering and settled for
the sea sleep that better men had taken

  mase looked up must be near sundown distance was
bluer the shadows were across strangler cuts white
sands he could see the hulk of the lulu jane and all about
her was a silky blur of water well that was good a
breeze was rippling the surface a man above couldnt see
the bottom clearly now

  mase studied his silent partner again hed lost track

                            -argosy-april -
	argosy

of time devlin might get impatient and haul on that line
that would be okay if jones didnt hoof along after mase
mase had a notion to stuff the wallet into d jones dank
clothes and swing up to the world of living men just tell
devlin he hadnt found any lost dough

  but then theyd want to hang around try it tomorrow
with better light no it would be better not to pull any-
thing on two guys with guns since mase hadnt even a pair
of pants on

  the tide and drifting weed kept d jones edging slowly
toward mase and mase stepped back he discovered he
was trying to tiptoe to avoid attracting jones attention and
that wa foolish

  jones couldnt hear or see he just wanted to dance gent-
ly on past mase down stranglers cut mase stood still
as stone and let him pass jones was almost astern the
shadow of the lulu jane when devlin jerked the line
devlin was trying to see overside but the ripples made
that sea twilight vague and shifty

  mase pulled back twice hed go up go up and laugh
this off tell em hed got stegers wallet easy but hed
just lingered to look at the pretty sea flowers yeah tell
em anything until he got on shore then tell em some
more-maybe at the inlet bar where they couldnt drag
guns to shut his mouth about davy jones brother

  that is if he ever got to the inlet bar-and was in
any shape to talk when he got there he wasnt quite
sure   

mase tightened the wallet in his belt swung on the line
and came up like a cat swinging on a grapevine four
fathoms up and the tide was full and still mase grunted
as he grasped the stern ladder the tide was as dead as d
jones-and he hadnt thought of that

  but he climbed clear leaned his lean brown body over
the transom and tugged at the helmet devlin grabbed it
together they wrenched it off and mase sat up steger
was on the cabin top looking dull and sick this long si-
lence below had got him bad

  yeah said devlin man you got it

  sure said mase nothin to the job i was lookinj
around

  he pulled the wallet from his knife belt and held it out to
devlin the gold-initial side down devlins eyes were
narrowing as he grinned he grabbed it and turned for-
ward

  okay boy-you did a job steger couldnt take it

  devlin halted staring at his pal steger was on his feet
yelling he pointed past devlin astern mase turned and
he knew why he turned d jones had heaved up follow-
ing the suck of the line for the tide had gone as dead as
he was and the weeds wouldnt stay down

  on his back was mr jones and grinning in the sunset
steger was dancing up and down shrieking devlin was
fixed as a statue for a minute watching him then he
turned slowly to look aft and that was when mase took
him on a rush naked and dripping reaching one hand
to devlins gun holster under his elbow and butting dev-
lins back with his wet head

  devlin went up and over the cockpit he hit the water
with a slight grunt so startled that he lost his voice he
splashed heavily and looked up this florida swamper had
surely lost his mind

  mase had the gun and he picked up the wallet steger
had ceased his panic and was staring at mase mckay
then he pointed and yelled again

  mase swung to him with the gun come aft pass me
an git that boathook outa the chock swing over the lad-
der and lay hold o jones hes cornin back with the turn
o tide git him you an devlin hang to that ladder

devlin or you dont hang to nothin heave on mr jones
the two o you rats

  devlin stroked clumsily to the ladder and he flinched
the dead man was not two yards from his shoulders
steger seemed to have collapsed like a big bent old man as
he shuffled past mase with hardly a look at him he got a
leg to the ladder and shoved the boathook out over dev-
lins head the steel caught jones dragging collar and he
slowed devlin turned and snarled at the dead face not a
yard from his own

  get away with that steger let me up the ladder
mase stood in the cockpit gun at stegers back no
you dont not either of you you hang to that ladder or
nothin make way fer mr jones jones comes first
damn if he dont long as im in charge o this party hey
jones come aboard

  steger groaned devlin did this knifed danny-
you yellow rat devlin raged at stegers face above
him you did it you and danny couldnt split that
take at the havana casino and you put heat on him out
at oriental park and he wouldnt let you in on it so you
cabled me to wet you two at key west you didnt have
the guts to handle him so you put it to me

  you put him away yesterday on this boat said steger
getting stolid and ugly now shank didnt see it you
told shank when we landed at the inlet that jones had
slipped ashore when shank was tying up shank was suspi-
cious he knew thered been trouble maybe he saw blood
somewhere when jones wallet fell overboard as you jumped
him i wouldnt knife a guy for money you would and
did

  listen said mase mckay this aint no court nor
inquest you two guys crawl aside on that ladder gimme
the end o that pole steger make way fer mr jones
he took the boathook and dragged jones came up drip-
ping and swinging and it looked to mase as if his right
foot took a twisting kick at devlins face devlin shrank
to one side anyhow steger crouched by the ladder and
jones brushed his arm

  mase backed away and straightened jones out in the
cockpit he tossed jones racetrack money down in the
galley sink and then turned to his passengers

  you two guys sit with your legs over the transom and
face aft youll enjoy the ride better lookin aft then
for-ard im pullin the hook and openin the gas the
lulu jane can travel when a guy like me says to

  you sit there quiet-unless youd rather heave off
the sharks are feedin inside now on the tide but damn
if i care what you do i can watch you all the way to the
inlet an crack the top off this bottle o scotch while i
steer i trust i like it

  he went swiftly forward got up the light hook and
traveled back watching them every second

  devlin turned his face astern and watched the white
water boil from the screw then he grunted to steger
try to talk to- this fellow five grand might make him
listen he could shove jones off again wed all have a
drink at the inlet-	l

  mase heard he put the gun by the wheel and stood
half-turned looking over jones in the cockpit to his
guests beyond

  i aint waitin  mase grinned im havin mine now
-straight im havin two drinks-mebbe four before i
turn you guys over to the deputies at the inlet hey
mister jones wish you could join me in one you cant
thats the hell of it

  and the rest of the way back to the inlet mase nad
time to think of how he might get some of what was in
that wallet

  the scotch was very good

murder goes

allan r bosworth

 theres a killer on board the u s s donsolation-
 hospital ship of the pacific fleet-and naval surgeon
  vincent ayres has been assigned the job of finding out
 who it is meanwhile the consolation is standing by
 u s s algonquin which has been rescuing the sur-
 vivors from a sunken submarine

   lieutenant mcquaid engineering officer of the navys
 new submarine starfish has been murdered-his head
 crushed by a blunt instrument-in the sick officers
 quarters of the naval hospital on the california coast

   the crime followed the mysterious sinking of the
 starfish on a trial run with the loss of twenty-two men
 in the flooded after compartment besides mcquaid
 those rescued on the first trip of the algonquins diving
 bell were

   lieutenant everett brill ii the submarines com-
 mander whom mcquaid had accused of being drunk
 after an altercation on the boat and who is now being
 held under arrest

   mike way chief torpedoman and master diver who
 is stricken with the bends after returning to help with
 the rescue and who wants to dive again to find a bottle
 that he took from brills pocket and hid before their
 rescue

   cardoni machinists mate who had threatened mc-
 quaid but who is removed from the list of suspects by
 his own murder on board the consolation

   kowalski another sailor and john thorpe jittery

youngster of the crew who is very new to navy life

 two civilian observers for westco iron works builder
of the starfish victor melhorne chief engineer and
foster bedell naval architect

 all of these men were in s o q when mcquaid was
murdered but there were others there that night all of
them close to the crime

gruff old admiral j k wetherbee retired laid up
with a broken leg whose carefully kept journal is
throwing interesting light on what happened

 evelyn brill the submarine commanders daugh-
ter who is following the family career as a navy nurse

 martin west submarine builder who is worried about
his government contract for more boats which may
now go to his competitor pacific maritime

 barbara his cafe-society daughter secretly engaged
to melhorne who has admitted visiting his room-near
mcquaids-on the night of the murder and who as
ayres learns later had been jilted several years before
by her fiance-mcquaid

 the blood-stained butt of a billiard cue taken from
thorpe after the murder seems to point to him as mur-
derer but mccarthy night watchman at the naval
hospital eventually admits that he had hit thorpe over
the head with it after taking it from him on the night
of mcquaids death

 meanwhile thorpe goes on a sleep-walking tour which

this story began in the argosy for march

takes him into the old admirals cabin and just before
coming to he attempts to seize the admirals logbook
and then after the murder of his roommate cardoni
thorpe disappears

at last it seems to dr ayres that there is going to be
a break in the case back from his diving work on
the sunken starfish mike way has news of an import-
ant discovery he made while down under ayres goes to
his cabin and the diver is just about to tell his story
when three shots are fired through the porthole

  the assassin disappears and way though unhit is
taken back to the algonquin suffering horribly from
the bends   

chapter xx

a log can lie

mikjtway came back to dim consciousness in the
algonquins recompression tank shouting and fighting
against the doctor and the pharmacists mate who were
massaging his arms and legs but the struggle was brief
and the big man pulled himself to a sitting position

  what time is it he demanded how long have i
been in here

  the doctor smiled less than an hour chief but
youre going to be here a lot longer youre going to spend
the night in here just to make sure

  mike lay back down thats all right sir-to stay all
night but in the morning i got to dive

  he glanced at the pressure gauge forty-five pounds-
approximately a hundred feet and the doctor and phar-
macist mate grinned at each other what are you try-
ing to do chief the corpsman asked humorously make
a rate

  i got to dive mike said stubbornly

  well talk about that later the doctor promised id
hate to see you cripple yourself for life

  i can take it mike declared just once more doctor
after i come up that time ill spend a week in this tank if
necessary but a lot depends on that dive now

  i sent you back to the consolation too soon as it was
said the doctor the bends are tricky its hard to tell
when the danger is past

  mike way frowned he was just remembering that
somebody-the murderer-had taken three shots at him
as he lay in his bunk on the consolation he remembered
that a sudden spasm of the bends had doubled him up an
instant before that gun began popping in the porthole it
was funny but the bends probably had saved his life  

  danger he growled hell its a damn sight safer on
the bottom than it is up here

  i heard about it the doctor said dryly but you
can talk about that later too just relax now and keep
this oxygen mask on for awhile

  after a time the doctor went out through the air lock
leaving the pharmacists mate to watch over the big
patient and to continue rubbing his arms and legs the
nitrogen was gradually working off oxygen speeded the
action of his blood in getting rid of the gas the pressure
inside the chamber was reduced at carefully timed inter-
 vals

mike could think now he reviewed the whole mys-
terious train of events from the time the starfish
started her full crash diving test to the present mcquaid
clubbed to death as he lay unconscious after the operation

               -sir ifhga--rmgra-

on his fractured skull    young john thorpe prowling
about the hospital grounds in the rainy dark carrying a
billiard cue   

  doc mike asked the pharmacists mate did you ever
have any experience with a sleepwalker

  there was still enough pressure in the chamber to dis-
tort a mans voice the corpsman looked up quickly
with a what

  a sleepwalker a guy who walks around with his eyes
open but who is really caulking off

  the pharmacists mate chuckled then sobered knew
one once at the san diego hospital he got a medical
survey out of the navy they figured they couldnt take
chances on a man who might get out of his hammock some
night and stroll over the side

  thats what this kid is supposed to have done mike
way said its not a gag then

  oh absolutely not i mean not if the guy who does it
aint putting on a gg i guess it would be kind of hard
to tell whether a man was faking or not anyway this
bird got out of the navy that way

  but ive seen a few others try to work tricks to get
paid off and it made me kind of suspicious one guy faked
a pretty good tb cough and when he was ordered up for
an x-ray of his chest he soaked some cigarettes in iodine
and smoked them-figuring the smoke would color his
lungs enough that theyd photograph dark like they were
inflamed

  did they give him a survey

  i dont know the corpsman said i was shanghaied
to the battlewagons about that time oh if a man really
wants out of the service they might as well kick him out
-hes no good in the navy

  mike way lay digesting this he couldnt imagine any-
bodys wanting out of the navy but then some men
couldnt stand the gaff that firstsix months or a year-
training station drills messcook duty and all the really
tough part he could remember his own days as an ap-
prentice and second-class seaman and the thought came to
him suddenly that young john thorpe was not yet through
that trying period

  but he pulled his mind back to the presentand the
problem before him regardless of who was guilty of the
murders there was that thing he had seen projecting from
one of the vents in the conning tower of the starfish it
looked mike way recalled something like the blade of a
thin curved knife

  he said i dont see how another dive would hurt me
before they had recompression tanks didnt they send a
guy back down to the bottom and bring him up more
slowly the pressure down theres the same as here
except replied the pharmacists mate you get
oxygen here and c down there and up here youre
warm and dry and youre not going to slip and fall twenty
feet off a deck and get squeezed completely into your hel-
met no id say theres a slight difference

back in admiral wetherbees room evelyn brill and
vince ayres were looking at a chart the gaunt old man
had drawn with no small amount of draftsmans skill

submarines have changed considerably since i did duty
in them he said in his booming voice but ive been
over this with lieutenant james since he came out of the
starfish and its fairly accurate you see this doctor
he pointed with his pencil to lines on the chart vince

                              -argosy-april -
murder goes to sea



nodded but human anatomy and the complications of a
submarine are two different things the doctor said i
dont understand it

  the starfish explained the admiral had two sepa-
rate main induction systems to supply air when she was
bn the surface they were separate mind you both
opened up here the bigger induction ran aft thats
where the diesels were and naturally they had to have
more air back there

  i can see that evelyn said

  all right when preparations are made for a dive the
power is shifted to the electric motors the inductions are
closed you cant see the valves up there but there is an
indicator board that lights up red and green its in the
control room and they call it the christmas tree

  lieutenant james your father and several other men
have told me that the christmas trees lights were all
green so-and the admiral sighed-the vents were
closed i had thought perhaps the water came in there
vince ayres rose and impatiently paced the room
then that leads us nowhere he said stopping to face
the admiral mike way found something but it could
hardly be those valves youve sketched they certainly
couldnt be seen from the outside of the ship

  he may have discovered a break in the hull the
admiral said or a hatch open aft-one of many things
well well find out when hes sufficiently recovered to
return to the consolation vince went on but in the
meantime weve got to act-before somebody else is
murdered

  admiral wetherbee shook his head with a mysterious
half smile and pressed the buzzer he said there will
be no more murders doctor not so long as mike way is
out of reach and when he comes back to the ship-oh
corpsman do you think you could forage the icebox and
find me a turkey leg thank you  and when he comes
back to the ship we must see that hes safely locked up
a sudden thought struck evelyn she leaned forward
to look the shaggy-browed man squarely in his eyes

  did you have anything to do with dads arrest ad-
miral wetherbee

  well yes the admiral nodded i sent a recommen-
dation to the commandant just before we sailed urging that
lieutenant brill be placed in custody-protective custody
the commandant approved and radio orders to that effect
followed

a ngry color flooded the girls cheeks but her voice
was cold you surely must have known what this
means to his record at a time when hes being considered
for selection as lieutenant commander it might have
even-

  easy there girt the admiral said gruffly therell
be no entry on his service record dont blow up a gale
until you know the reasons for things then you wont have
to now when we came aboard the consolation i reasoned
that thorpe was not the murderer i deduced that everett
brill was either guilty of murder or he was in danger of
being killed himself   

  no-hear me out now mcquaid was killed to cover
up something it could have been neglect of duty on
your fathers part-the intoxication charge which i didnt
want to believe-or it could have been to cover up any
chance of a structural faults being discovered before
westco iron works cinched that fat contract

   so you took it out on dad evelyn said bitterly she
was dangerously near to tears

   the admiral shook his head

  no i had him locked up to eliminate him from the
scene both for his own protection and to study what hap-
pened you know how well my theory was proved-much
more strongly than id expected-by cardonis murder
and that helped dad a lot the girl cried he was
seen in the passageway just before cardonis body was
found

   coincidence the admiral retorted i had lieutenant
brill locked up because it was the best thing to do i wish
now that we had locked up cardoni

   the corpsman came back with a turkey leg and a glass
of milk and grinned as he put the platter on the bedside
locker the admiral began eating

  vince ayres satdown again he said well-what
about thorpe then is he missing or not

  admiral wetherbees sea-blue eyes twinkled and then
turned crafty youve certainly got me under your guns
tonight havent you he chuckled well  i dont
know where thorpe is i havent seen him since i had him
up here for questioning did they search the ship thor-
oughly

   yes sir vince answered

   they found his white hat and some of his clothes im
told the admiral went on that looks bad the lad most
certainly should have been locked up doctor

   ive been criticized on that point vince snapped
you questioned him then what did you learn

  the admirals brows crawled together i found put
more by having information relayed to me from ashore-
data concerning his lifeas a civilian you were right when
you speculated that hed been somewhat of a mammas
boy only son of a widowed mother three older sisters
spoiled and petted you might say he had an apron-string
complex and the navy was too much for him

   he might have changed evelyn said the transition
to submarine lifei was too sudden and the shock he suf-
fered ive never been able to convince myself that he
had anything to do with the murders

   i think his connection with the case was quite similar
to your fathers the admiral said so far as our investi-
gation i mean he could have been considered guilty
on the other hand he himself was the most logical con-
tender for the doubtful honor of becoming the next victim
because with his death all three of the men who escaped
from the after portion of the starfish would have been
silenced

   he must have known this and it preyed upon his mind
so-he disappeared and we have reasonable proof that
he wasnt guilty now that proof is the fact that the mur-
derer subsequently tried to kill mike way

ince shook his head in other words you eliminated
 brill and youre of the opinion that thorpe eliminated
himself and then the murderer still strikes-at the man
who thinks hes found why the starfish sank youre inti-
mating then that one of four persons committed the mur-
ders

  what four the admiral demanded

   martin west victor melhorne foster bedell or bar-
bara west oh ive had my suspicions too but we havent
an iota of real evidence against any of them were right
where we started	- -- -------

  im not intimating any of them is guilty the admiral
said testily they built that ship it seems to me that
sabotage by any of them-and thats what youd have to
consider-would be most unlikely there are others you
know did you question kowalski

  why yes briefly he wasnt aft in the submarine and
he certainly had no reason to kill mcquaid or cardoni
the admiral reached for his logbook from the number
of pages he turned before finding what he sought vince
realized that the old man had made public only a fraction
of his entries

  i had kowalskis past investigated too he said
listen kowalski ivan peter fireman lc usn from
chicago father was a radical kowalski himself once
active in young communist group arrested once on charge
of arson but acquitted apparently reformed in political
beliefs and joined navy navy record good 

  vince said you dont mean to tell me you think any-
body would attempt to destroy a submarine when he was
down in it

  i never knew a man so foolish the admiral sighed

  all right sir vince replied and came to the point
that logbook has been of great help so far admiral but
today in it you said you knew the identity of the mur-
derer thats what i came here to find out if you do
know this is no time to be keeping the knowledge secret
the admirals hearty chuckle rumbled through the room
doctor he said with an airy wave of the diminished
drumstick i wouldnt want you to pass this along nor
you evelyn both of you know how scuttlebutt rumor
spreads through a ship

  they were expectantly silent admiral wetherbee per-
mitted himself another chuckle

  the fact is he said that logbooks sometimes give out
the damnedest false impressions to be found anywhere
then you really dont know

  the admiral looked at the porthole as if his keen old
eyes could see the rise and fall of the swells that were one
with the darkness he said evasively did you ever hear
the old story about the merchant skipper and the mate who
was inclined to tipple now and then the skipper logged
this entry the mate was drunk today that made the
mate pretty sore being put on record next day when he
had occasion to write the log he put down the captain
was sober today

  he smiled at them innocently that shows you id
like to create the illusion that this logbook sees knows
and tells all and id like for you to help me create that
illusion but as for yourselves remember that any log-
book can give out a false impression

chapter xxi

the ghost goes down

vince ayres hardly kfiew whether to be angry or
amused when he and evelyn left the admirals room
humor of the situation struck him but he felt a certain
annoyance too the commandant had placed him in
charge of the investigation but this old man lay back in
his quiet room with his starboard leg in a cast and pulled
the strings as if all the actors in the grim mystery pliy
were puppets

  they stopped in a ward diet kitchen where mae ken-
nedy the premaarely motherly-looking nurse made them

coffee and sandwiches and remarked that they must be
dead on their feet

  evelyn shook her head and vince saw a glint in her
gray eyes she told him when mae was out of hearing
im not tired any more im angry-and disappointed
the admiral has always been one of my favorite people but
what right did he have to cause dads arrest--to cause him
all the mental torture hes suffered for two days

  i dont know vince said slowly he removed his
glasses and she noticed how much younger his sensitive
face looked without them he said maybe he was right
though evelyn better a little mental discomfort than a
shot in the back-or a marlin hitch around your neck
oh i dont question his motives he thought he was
doing the right thing but youre in charge vince and-
well i trust your judgment if youd had dad locked
up-

  she stopped confused vince ayres reached for her
band and their eyes met shining but the plump nurse
came back into the diet kitchen to sterilize a hypodermic
needle by boiling it and the shadow of unsolved and un-
known things rose between them 

  youre in charge evelyn repeated after all hes
retired and his rank doesnt count so much any more
wed all appreciate his help of course but hes practically
taken things over-and bungled them hes claimed pub-
licly that the crime is solved and he cant make good on
that claim

  i wondered vince said sqftly the old boy is very
shrewd  i can understand how he feels too evelyn
by the time a man reaches flag rank hes pretty well ac-
customed to running his own show so the admiral has
been virtually running this one behind the scenes but
maybe he saved your father from getting killed well
probably never know lets give him a little more time to
make good before we pass judgment after all ive ac-
complished nothing and ive got only twenty-four more
hours to figure this thing out

  but suppose you havent turned up the murderer by
tomorrow night what can captain mckee do about it
he doesnt know the background of the case hed be
starting in cold

  he wouldnt start on it at all vince said grimly
hed simply lock all of us up-you and me too-and
keep us locked up until weve docked again and authorities
ashore can take over that way the murder trail would be
getting colder all the time and none of us could help

when vince had gone to his room lieutenant james
came looking for him the small dapper officer did-
nt look like a man whod gone through an ordeal of wait-
ing on the bottom of the sea but his eyes were worried
after some hesitation he drew a bottle from his pocket

  chief way sent word down by the rescue bell that you
wanted to see this doctor he said but if somebodys
trying to tell you the skipper was drunk that somebodys
a liar

  vince smiled at this straightforward expression of
loyalty i dont think it will come to that now he as-
sured james but this bottle may be exhibit a for the
defense if everett brill should be accused

  he drew the cork to smell and taste the few drops of
liquid remaing in the small flask

  elixir of terpin hydrate all right he said coilgh
medicine i think maybe somebody jogged the pharmacists

mate s elbow when he poured in the alcohol but a man
would have to drink a considerable quantity to get tight
on it

  im glad i brought the bottle up then james said
i was worried when the chief said you wanted it you see
doctor captain brill is-well a white man hes four-o
and all of us are back of him all of us he added signi-
ficantly who are left 

  i cant say what will happen if the board of inquiry
has to investigate a submarine disaster and several mur-
ders too vince said but im hoping he wont be
blamed for anything id like to ask you a few questions
lieutenant 

  the executive officer cou tell him nothing new yes
he had noticed mcquaids bitterness toward the captain
like mike way he thought it was one of those things
everett brill could handle and it would have adjusted
itself within a short time a shakedown cruise james said
not only proved a ships engines but it got the personnel
working smoothly too he agreed that cardoni was
wrought up to the point of murder after mcquaid shut
that watertight door

  but the chances were that cardonis brother never
could have reached the door anyway he said and the
memory of the horror twisted his lips those men back
there died quickly and mercifully

  what about thorpe vince asked

  he was one of those prdblem children who get in the
navy now and then he should have been given an in-
aptitude discharge at the training station maybe that
sounds harsh ive seen some of those boys snap out of it
and make sailormen all right but im not sure that
thorpe ever would have done that i expected to see him
go over the hill-run away-the first time he had liberty
and a few dollars

  do you think hed be capable of committing a couple of
myrders-and trying a third

  james stared i dont get that about the third attempt
he said not if you mean the shots fired at mike way
thorpe disappeared before that happened according to
what i was told-walked over the side

  im only speculating vince said what do you
think

  hell i think it takes a certain amount of nerve to
commit a murder

vince undressed as soon as the submarines executive
officer had gone then he answered a knock at his
door and received a radio message from the intelligence
officer on shore-

    tod 

   vince went to bed with his head whirling from weari-
ness and a sense of confusion nothing tied in here to
make a complete pattern the case was full of seemingly
irrelevant things such as the admirals deduction that the
murder blows had been timed to the chopping of ice in the
diet kitchen

   everything was at loose ends admiral wetherbee he
reflected would have called these dangling unsecured
pieces of evidence irish pennants the investigation
appeared to be becalmed fouled in a sargasso sea of com-
plications and possibilities

   john thorp was as james had described him he had
lacked the nerve required to commit murder initiative
vince thought was a better word but thorpe normally
awake and thorpe under the psychosis of somnambulism
were two different persons the subconscious desire to kill
might have manifested itself in his sleep

   but the admiral apparently believed thorpe was dead
before that gun was thrust through a porthole to fire at
mike way the consolation was a big ship and an almost
empty one vince was not overlooking the possibility of a
mans being able to hide in it

   he doubted however that any somnambulist could aim
a gun within inches of a mans head and when things
went back to a rainy night on the hospital balcony and
to a man seen there with a club they came to a new
tangle the club was irrelevant too it had not been
the murder weapon

   irish pennants and nothing else   

rphe ship slept at  the bosuns mate on duty

   roused out the four-to-eight anchor watch and a sea
man climbed to the bridge with a pot of jamoke-the
navys word for coffee the consolation was swinging a
little with the tide as she rode the dark lifting swells

   there was still a ring around the moon and from high
above the riding lights of the ships standing by over the
grave of the starfish must have looked like another ring
on the sea the algonquin yonder the westsal-wests
salvage boat-scarcely a lines throw to her starboard the
consolation and a destroyer anchored a little farther
away

   lights gleamed from the portholes of one room well
aft on the main deck of the consolation the admiral was
writing in his log chuckling to himself in the full satisfac-
tion of employing navy terms to record trivial incidents

   if victor melhorne could have seen the admiral as he
wrote the pale-eyed shipbuilding official would have been
certain that the old man was indeed in his second child-
hood but melhorne was asleep and he had no inkling of
the schedule admiral wetherbee had drawn for himself

   dawn came over the sea sullen and gray it was fri-
day the thirteenth

uor the rest of those aboard the day began much as
yesterday had started for vince ayres the outlook
was even blacker but there was a break in the ships
routine

   it came immediately after quarters and because of its
nature it was not listed either on the consolations work
and drill schedule or on that admiral wetherbee had
written general alarm gongs began ringing throughout
the ship with their high-tongued insistent clamor a bugle
blared from the loud speakers and the swift patter of feet
swept over the deck above the isolation ward

   evelyn brill caught her breath there was something
ominous in the tempo of these sounds she turned to vince
ayres

   fire vince

   the bugle was blowing double time vince shook his
head and smiled to reassure the girl and then a bosuns
pipe shrilled through the speakers and the bosuns voice
followed

   all hands abandon ship all hands abandon ship
its just a drill vince said come with me all
right everybody lay up to your boat stations

   he seized lifejackets and thrust one into evelyns hand
as thay ran up the ladder she noted the swift synchron-
ized pattern with which the consolations crew acted
only the four civilians seemed bewildered mej came up
from below to the loud rattling of hand chains the gen-
eral alarm gongs were still beating everywhere throughout
the ship as they reached their station near the boat
assigned to them hospital corpsmen appeared bearing
stretchers and first-aid pouches

   theres dad evelyn cried

   he smiled across at her but he still looked pale and
worried there was a belted sentry with him she could
guess that this little interlude of make-believe action had
stirred him just as it brought a tingle to her spine the
navy-the salt of it and the steel of it-was in their
blood

   an officer moved swiftly along the deck inspecting
lifebelts checking the boat crews and equipment vince
caught evelyns arm

   look he exclaimed

   it was a bareheaded thin-faced man in undress whites
standing by with the group at the next boat it was john
thorpe

   the bugle sounded secure the bosuns pipe shrilled

again and the voice from all the loud speakers said
secure a big chief master-at-arms hustled thorpe be-
low again but everybody in the murder investigation party
had seen him

chapter xxii
heres a gun

 the algonquin tossed uneasily it was just after noon

   the sea had quieted considerably and the sky was
 overcast big mike way sat disconsolately on the bitts
 while the bears dressed another man he was a chunky and
 cheerful second-class gunners mate named alexander mike
 way wasnt going down

   it was no use arguing with the doctor or with the
 three-striper who was in charge of salvage operations

    i got to dive the chief torpedoman said i got to
 its important she was my ship cant i be the first to
 open that after hatch and go inside her i got a right to
 do that

   the pharmacists mate who had spent most of the night
 in the recompression chamber with him grunted

   youve got a crow tubes he said and patted the
 eagle on mikes starboard sleeve what do you want a
 pair of wings	-s 

    its important as hell mike insisted

   alexander sat on the dressing bench as nonchalantly
 as if he were going for a walk the wind died and fog
 came stealthily over the seas face like a thick gray veil it
 blotted out the destroyer first and mike way watched
 it swallow the consolation and the westsal the bears
 put the heavy shoes on alexanders feet and lifted the cop-
 per breastplate into place mike way saw him feeling for
 his knife to make certain it was in its sheath

    then they put his helmet on and helped him to the stage
 it wasnt right another man doing mike ways job he
 saw alexander giving his suit air and the stage went down
 to helmet depth in the water

    take him to the descending line

   the bubbles began drifting along the side of the ship
 in a silvery chain

   lower away

   the commander came along the deck toward alex-
anders talker and mike way rose

   commander sir i-

    nothing doing chief the officer said kindly weve
 got enough divers on the sick list as it is we dont want
 to kill anybody

   so it was no use mike way sat down again his shoul-
 ders hunched sometimes those ribs he had cracked or
 bruised in the starfish bothered him they were still sore
 but a manfelt just as well on the bottom-better than
 he did up here knowing that there was something to look
 for down below

   the talker said hes on the submarine okay alec
 take it easy now get your bearings  okay

an interval only the slap of the swells against
the side the tautening and slackening of the lines
that meant air and life to the diver forty fathoms down
mike way was sweating despite the chill fog he knew
every move alexander would be making down there

groping aft walking like a man in slow motion pic-
tures guarding against a misstep that might plunge him

                       -argosy-april - 
murder goes to sea



over the slippery rounded side and into a fatal squeeze
working his way toward that other escape hatch which
no man had lived to use   

  hes at the hatch

  had to be careful now mike way thought if there
should be pressure sealed in that portion of the sub-
marine the hatch might fly open the instant its catch was
released might knock alexander over the side

  hes trying to open it

  the minutes were adding up twenty minutes down
there at that pressure was enough for anybody mike
way looked out into the swirl of gray fog and cursed his
luck if he hadnt got the bends yesterday theyd have
let him dive

  hes having a little trouble with the hatch

  mike way swabbed the perspiration jrom his forehead
everybody on the deck of the algonquin felt the strain
every man of them was down there trying to help   

  alec there was a new note in the talkers voice
are you okay hey alec answer me cant you hear
me and then a strained interval and commander his
phones gone dead

  the commander was taking no chances he whirled
toward the men who handled alexanders lines take
him up

  they hauled in the slack it came and that was all
the next swell put a strain on the lines that wasnt good
to see

  alec sound off down there can you hear me see
if you can get a signal on his lifeline you guys

  they yanked on the line but no answering jerk came
mike way got slowly to his feet wbndering what had
happened the after part of the starfish should be free
of any gear that might entangle lines but you never
could tell up here where the sea rolled and the fog was
wet to your cheek

  his lines are fouled commander we cant hoist
him

  vast heaving the officer said sharply well haveto
send another diver down

  mike way sprang forward eagerly let me go sir
he cried i know the ship commander let me go

  get into a rig chief the commander said

vince ayres went aft to the admirals room imme-
diately after secure had been sounded following the
abandon ship drill before he had been half amused now
he was angry he knocked and the booming voice told
him to enter

  admiral wetherbee was in his wheelchair with the plas-
ter cast thrust straight out on the elevated half of the

meet the fabulous

footrest he had turned the chair to face the bow of the
ship that way the beam roll did not disturb its equili-
brium and he was reading mahan

  good morning doctor he said heartily ive been
expecting you anything new

  you didnt turn out for abandon ship drill did you
sir vince asked significantly

  in this rig no

  well thorpe did

  the admirals shaggy gray brows went up that so
everybody saw him i suppose

  everybody including captain mckee you told me
last night that you didnt know where he was ive appre-
ciated your help admiral wetherbee but dont you think
thats going a little too far i reported thorpe missing
im delighted that he isnt but i think you might have
told me-

  the admiral waved a bony hand captain mckee has
already been in to see me he said and chuckled bawled
me out-first time ive had rocks and shoals read to me
in years i rather enjoyed it doctor its good for anybody
in this mans navy to have a dressing down now and then
it makes you remember that no matter how much gold you
get on your sleeve theres always someone in authority
over you

  about thorpe now vince reminded him

  oh yes well doctor if youll remember i didnt
tell you a lie last night i said i didnt know where thorpe
was-which was literally true i left his place of con-
finement to the chief master-at-arms who once did duty
with me when i was in the battleships that chief doctor
would do almost anything i could ask

  very commendable loyalty im sure vince said with
considerable sarcasm your putting everett brill out of
danger was a good idea sir but we knew where brill
was i could question him if the need for further ques-
tioning arose it was different in thorpes case i wanted
to study that boy i wanted to determine whether his
somnambulism was real or faked and you have him
secretly locked up

  just a minute doctor there were storm signals in
the old mans eyes you will understand before the day
is over that i saved thorpes life by acting as i did also
the belief that thorpe was dead gave the murderer a
sense of false security that has helped to draw the net
a little tighter

  i cant see it vince said

  you will sit down doctor and look at this its
a work and drill schedule ive drawn up for today
vince ayres permitted himself a little snort as he
skimmed over the admirals fine writing friction with

this old man was the last thing he would have expected
when the consolation put to sea and murder went along
with herv but now he had begun to wonder if what victor
melhorne had said wasnt true admiral wetherbee was
in his second childhood

    or when contact is made  he read  trap
murderer and solve tactical problem of murder mystery
solve mystery of loss of uss starfish 

tj  said aloud im afraid were a long way from the
joal youve outlined laudable as it is youll excuse
me now sir ive work to do id like to ask you one
thing has thorpe been permitted to leave his room did
miss wilkins actually see him

  the admiral chuckled when she thought she saw a
ghost yes that was thorpe in the flesh i had him brought
up here for questioning and i apparently frightened him
rather badly so he was quite pale as he went back and
i had given him a pair of bed sheets whatever storeroom
or gear locker the chief placed him in had no bedding
he went out of here with the sheets draped over his
shoulder

  then if he had the run of the ship he could have been
the person who fired at mike way

  sea dust snorted the admiral thorpe had no gun
im sure he wasnt at large at that i impressed upon him
the necessity for his keeping to his hideout for his own
protection i also tojd him he was no more a sleepwalker
than i am-and i hardly ever sleep

  a short time before this old sailor had been asking
vince to draw upon his medical knowledge in an effort to
determine whether thorpes sleepwalking was real it
amused the doctor now to find that the admiral had made
his own diagnosis

  remember how he jumped when he knocked that
glass off this bedside locker the admiral asked well
a man who is asleep certainly wouldnt react so quickly
hed wait untij the tumbler struck his foot

  vince had no comment he only asked dryly what
did the boy say

  why he maintained that he was asleep of course
but i have my own idea about that after whats hap-
pened he couldnt very well admit he had been faking
vince rose to go he said politely admiral wetherbee
ive appreciated your assistance but so long as i have
been charged with the responsibility of running down this
murderer i must protest against any further interference
from any source do i make myself clear sir

  the admiral stiffened perfectly doctor he growled
those storm signals glinted in his sea-blue eyes again
and as vince came to attention out of respect for the old
mans rank he thought h saw another light in them he
left with the distinct impression that admiral j k
wetherbee was secretly laughing

  and when he had gone the man in the wheelchair
reached for his buzzer

  ask one of the radiomen to step in here a moment
please he told the corpsman who answered and while he
was waiting he added one of the personal entries that
had become so numerous in his logbook of late

  note admirable spirit shown by lieut vincent ayrfs
  uc usn not always found in staff officers forced to
  conclusion that nothing is holding him back so fas as brill
  evelyn nnc is concerned except her determination not to
  marry a navy man must talk to her again about this   

tince ayres went to the isolation ward where the
 other members of the party had gathered the first
person he saw as he entered the door was captain mckee
the tall military-looking medical officer was accompanied
by the chief master-at-arms and just now he wore an
exceptionally grim countenance

  weve been waiting for you fpr some time dr ayres
mckee said snappishly this isnt getting the murder
mystery cleared away you know

  more interference vince thought the commandant
might have expected it would work out this way when
he sent a medical corps two-striper to sea in charge of
an investigation he was suddenly weary of the job sick
of the whole case

  he looked past mckee and saw martin wests fat face
reflecting an enjoyment of his discomforture and there
was a superior disdain on barbara wests magenta lips
but evelyn brill met his glance with warm sympathy in
her gray eyes and he knew that she understood

  captain mckees next words brought him back to the
present and to a quick heightened interest you may
wonder just why i chose to hold abandon ship drill this
morning the captain was saying while it was going on
a thorough search was being made of all quarters we
found this

  he held out an object wrapped in medical department
gauze the white folds fell away from the cold glint of
blue steel the gun that was fired at mike way

  vince ayres scarcely heard these words he was listen
ing to a fluttery little cry that broke through the ward as
everyone craned his neck to see what the captain wa
holding

  the sound escaped from the lips of barbara west
captain mckee faced her yes miss west he said
slowly the gun was in your room perhaps you can
explain its possession

  for a space there was strained tense stillness in the
compartment the consolation lifted on a swell slanted
down with it and lurched slightly in the trough from
the deck forward the shrill of a bosmis pipe came dimly
and a faintly-heard shout of sweepers start your brooms
give her a clean sweep down fore and aft but here in
the isolation ward there was no movement

      

lince ayres looked at the smartly-dressed girl her
 lips moved but no sound came from them she buried
her face suddenly in her hands and then martin west
was on his feet his heavy features at first pale then dark-
ening under an angry rush of color

  this is preposterous captain mckee he shouted
if the gun was found there it had been planted my
daughter never owned a pistol in her life i doubt that
she ever shot one

  the captain walked to the ward dressing table where
an array of bottles and instruments stood and carefully
put down the gauze wrapped weapon

   we will of course be able to bring out fingerprints 
he said the gun was quite cleverly hidden-from a
landsmans point of view it had been placed well inside
the mouth of the blower like this one here-he indi-
cated the megaphone-shaped ventilator on the overhead-
the blower was covered with gauze to prevent any soot
from being blown into the room

  it might have been found today anyway because the
gauze is changed every friday but i instructed the search-
murder goes to sea



ing party to look inside the blowers they happen to be
favorite hiding places for liquor non-regulation clothing
and anything else a hospital corpsman isnt supposed to
have in his possession

     west made an angry gesture thats all beside the
  point i say the gun must have been planted there it was
  put where it would be found so as to divert suspicion from
  the man whos guilty if it wasnt why didnt he merely
  throw it over the side 

     vince ayres said perhaps i can answer that perhaps
   the person who fired it-and missed remember-intended
   to use it again guns arent plentiful aboard a hospital
   ship you know the consolation is a non-combatant
   she has no armory

   he faced barbara west all her spoiled pride and
  hauteur were gone she was a pitiful huddlp now shaken
  by frightened sobs

   miss west- he began

     i-i never saw the thing before she wailed lifting
   her head mascara had streaked her cheeks and her eyes
   were wide and scared i dont know anything about it
   please leave me alone-leave me alone

     martin west took her in his arms and glared defiantly
   at the navy men captain mckee glanced significantly
   at vince ayres both were remembering that barbara
   had cried out the instant the gun was unwrapped both
   knew she was lying

     dr ayres mckee said ill take the gun to the
  laboratory and have the fingerprints brought out and
   photographed you will please carry on oh-heres the
  clip taken from the gun three cartridges gone he
  turned at the door and added please remember that i
   expect action today 

chapter xxiii

hear my story

  mike way frowned over the side of the algonquin
   as the bears made record time hustling him into his
  diving suit bubbles were still swinging to the heaving
  surface in a slender silvery chain alexander was still
  getting air unless there was a leak in his lihe but all
  efforts to hoist him had failed and the deck crew didnt
  dare pull any harder for fear of breaking the precious air
  hose

     the commander who was in charge of the salvage opera-
   tions came to the dressing bench looking worried you
   understand how to operate the underwater torch way
   he said better take it down with you it may be neces-
   sary to cut something away alexanders got quite a bit
   of line out he may have entered the submarine before
   getting caught	

     aye aye sir mike way said

     they weighted him with shoes and belt got the breast-
   plate collar over his wide shoulders and nearly tore off
   his nose putting the helmet over his head in a hurry but
   he cursed them for their slowness it seaned an age before
   the face port was closed and he could test his air

     he opened the valve over his left breast there was a
   hiss and a roar the breastplate lifted and the rubberized
   canvas suit filled making mike ay formidable he felt
   down at his side for the copper sheath and made sure that
   his knife was in place	

     test your phone mike the talker said

  one two three four mike said impatiently

  okay

  somebody rapped twice on the resounding copper hel-
met with a wrench mike turned shuffling toward the
stage with two men to help him his ribs were sore it
required effort to pull himself onto the swaying stage and
grasp the bails with his mittened hands

  the gray vater lapped over his leaden shoes going
down his helmet went under and the stage stopped with
a jerk mike tested the air again and valved out the
extra pressure by hitting the spit-valve with his chin
no leaks in the suit the exhaust valve at the back of his
helmet was gurgling merrily

  okay ready for the torch he said

  it came snaking down before him suspended by the
hoses which supplied air oxygen and hydrogen and the
wire for the electric igniter mike-way thrust his left arm
through a lanyard on the torch and called for them to take
him to the descending line

   his ribs hurt as the pressure built up inside his suit
but he felt fine he was diving again they should have
let him go down in the first place once on the bottom
hed get alexander out of the jam in a hurry and start
him on his way to topside and safety then he could lower
himself into the after escape hatch of the starfish

  there was a mystery down below waiting to be found
was the explanation of why the submarine sank so swiftly
and why twenty-two men had died it was linked too
with the mystery of two murders or more and with those
shots which came so near to ending mike ways own life
he was confident that he would solve at least part of the
mystery this trip

  how do you feel mike his talker asked

  okay but give me more slack-pay it out faster
hell man im in a hurry

  iron man mike way didnt know that alexander was
already beyond human aid or that death in a horrible
form would reach out for him before his twenty minutes
were up

mcquaids murder she wore miss brills cape to protect
her clothing from the rain she attempted to wake victor
melhorne at his window to tell him you were leaving
for the hotel when-

  weve been through all this the dark-haired girl
flared

  when she failed vince went on patiently she started
back to the reception room and was frightened by a man
carrying a club

  the murderer said martin west

  not likely mr west i havent told you but the
actual murder weapon was found yesterday at the hos-
pital it wasnt a club but a brick that had been taken
from that vacant quiet room the one between mcquaids
room and the diet kitchen

  barbara west flounced around as if her chair were hot
oh whats the sense of all this what are you driving
at now

  this vince said he leaned forward his eyes inscru-
table behind the clear glasses youre secretly engaged
to marry victor melhorne miss west nobody but your
father knows it you said and when you told me your
story before you were very anxious to protect melhorne
against what she demanded sarcastically

  against the suspicion-which you have snared too-
that he led lieutenant mcquaid

  the shot hit home barbara wests scornful laugh was
strained exaggerated she said the very idea and
why would victor have any reason to kill anybody-par-
ticularly frederick mcquaid

  you didnt tell me everything vince said gently i
had the newspaper files examined remember i asked you
if your photo hadnt been in the society section well we
found it you were once engaged to marry mcquaid
the gril moaned oh what if i was i didnt and thats
been two years ago

  martin west grew livid and loud youve no business
dragging that in ive had enough of this ill go see the
captain

  go ahead vince told him grimly the captain has
told me that unless this thing is cleared up tonight hes
going to lock all of us up-and turn the matter over to
shore authorities i can promise you theyd be tougher

est subsided vince glanced at evelyn brill who
was taking down the conversation in shorthand with
an odd gleam of triumph in his eyes

  all right he said you will agree that melhorne could
possibly have been jealous at the fact that you and
mcquaid were thrown together again you protected him
then by affirming that he was very soundly asleep are
you doing the same thing now miss west is that victor
melhornes gun

  the girl shot him a hateful glance her spirit was
returning

  ive told you i never saw the gun before she said

  why dont you ask lieutenant brill about the gun
martin west demanded and that boy thorpe its
funny how he makes people think he was lost over the
side then turns up on deck today you know that he was
sore at mcquaid

  is it your gun mr west vince shot at him

  it is not

  very well ill talk to melhorne and bedell when they
come back from the west sal tonight by that time we will
have the photographic record of the fingerprints you have
no objection of course to allowing your own fingerprints
to be taken for comparison

  i certainly have west retorted were not common
criminals

  id think that matter over vince said that will
be all just now thank you very much

   he lighted acigarette and looked thoughtfully
through the glass into the ward there was nobody out
there he wanted to question just now thorpe- hed
have thorpe brought up later from his hiding place wher-
ever it was melhorne hed have to face later bedell
didnt tie in

  he remembered with a sort of shock that hed have to
ask evelyns father more questions the confinement of
both everett brill and john thorpe had not been close
enough if a man could come up to see the admiral he
might be out of his locked room long enough to attempt
a murder

  evelyn said vince its not a navy gun and he knew
what she was thinking

  no but theres nothing to prevent ainavy man from
obtaining a gun like it and its small enough to be smug-
gled aboard easily enough the way sailors sometimes hide
a pint bottle in their socks under their bell-bottoms
whose do you think it is

  we may never learn that he said but its a cinch
barbara west knew it was hidden in her room she yelled
before she was hurt one thing you have to hand to her
she must really be in love with that pale-eyed victor mel-
horne she certainly was afraid that hed committed mur-
der and she still cared enough to do everything she could
to protect him

  womanlike said evelyn

  he looked at her with a strange tenderness wondering
if she would do the same

ny woman she said softly will do her best to
reform her man by words and prayers and exemplary
righteousness up to a certain point shell moralize after
that-

  vince smiled go on he said

  that point is danger for her man when he actually
is in peril she quits preaching shed lie and cheat shed
even kill to save him thats the way women are and
barbara west is no different from the rest

  he leaned close seeing the warm pastel tint creeping
into her cheeks because of his nearness he said lightly
evelyn if you cbuld love me like that id take your
word for it id promise never to commit murder arson
or even mayhem to put you to the test and as for bigamy
why-id only commit bigamy under one circumstance
she laughed he remembered that it had been a long
time  since he had heard the happiness of her laughter it
never occurred to him that for days he had been serious
and worried and driven or that in his banter he was
murder goes to sea



revealing an almost new side of his nature to the girl

  all right vince she prompted youd commit bigamy
if-

  if i found you had a twin sister wont you marry
me darling oh a medical officers duty isnt so bad
evelyn-not as bad as other navy people catch about
four years of shore duty to two years at sea and id even
consider resigning and entering civil practice

  somebody laughed out in the ward evelyn exclaimed
let go my hand vince theyre watching us

  for a moment enchanted at what they saw in each
others eyes they had forgotten the spell was broken
now there remained a grim task to do there was the
prospect of ruin for her father there was danger for each
of them and for all the others but one person

  they still had to find out who that person was

tn mid-afternoon a first-class pharmacists mate
came from the laboratory with the pistol he shook
his head as he handed vince the gun im sorry sir
he said whoever used this roscoe was mighty careful
all the fingerprints had been wiped off all but one 
ones all we need vince said did you get that
the technician grinned yes sir it was the skippers-
captain mckees i compared it with those on his service
record dr ayres

  vince was too disturbed to appreciate the joke well
he sighed-thats that another blind trail i suppose all
weve got to work on now is the guns serial number it
looks like a new weapon ill send the serial number
ashore and see if they can locate the dealer who sold it
thats already been done doctor said the corpsman
the admiral he sent to the laboratory for a full de-
scription and the serial number then he radioed the dope
to somebody in nineteenth naval district

  thank you anyway vince said

  all along he thought there probably had been a dupli-
cation of effort-the admiral likely had been requesting the
same information from intelligence that yince had asked
well the old boy was one up on him now vince made a
mental note to call on the admiral later to ask if any answer
had been received to his query concerning the purchase of
the automatic

  but another radio message came first it was an urgent
priority for captain mckee and the tall four-striper
himself brought it to the isolation ward he appeared
visibly disturbed

  i-er-have received orders which affect you and this
-er-group he said with your permission doctor ill
read them aloud he cleared his throat waited for atten-

tion and then went directly into the main portion of the

 message

    from commandant nineteenth naval district

   to capt w p mckee mc usn commanding uss
 consolation

    subject murder injuiry change in command of

    	immediately upon receipt of these orders rear admiral
 j k wetherbee usn retd will assume command of the
 inquiry into the murders of lieutenant mcquaid and ma-
 chinists mate cardoni replacing lieut vincent ayres
 mc usn

    	lieut ayres will continue actively in the investigation
 rendering all possible assistance to admiral wetherbee

    	particular effort is to be directed along the lines set
 forth in the log which admiral wetherbee has kept and
 which is of the utmost importance in this investigation

    there was a silence vince broke it by saying i will
 report to the admiral at once sir he saw resentment
 blazing in evelyn brills eyes and captain mckee drew
 him aside

   i want you to know that i made no report no recom-
 mendation he said this is an order and we shouldnt
 question it but what can the admiral do doctor hes
 an old man and whats more hes got a broken leg and
 cant get around if the consolation had been assigned
 to the fleet this wouldnt have happened the c in c
 wouldnt be putting anybody like the admiral in charge
 its what comes of being attached to a shore district

   vince smiled and he wasnt entirely unhappy at the
 order he had an idea that somebody-and it could be no
 one but the admiral himself-had pulled a string to fore-
 stall captain mckees threat to lock up everybody and
 turn the investigation over to the naval authorities ashore
 the admjral had rank enough to get away with such a
 move he was retired and there could be no comeback
 that would injure him

 it doesnt really matter vince said i suppose the
 commandant lost patience and with two murders and a
 third attempt the case attained proportions commensurate
 with flag rank frankly ill be rather glad to get out from
 under

 a messenger entered and handed vince a folded paper
 he opened it and saw a penciled schoolboy scrawl

 doctor ayres

    i have been thinking things over since the admiral talked
 to me if you can help me by seeing that they are not too
 hard on me i would like to confess

                                      john thorpe sea c

author of too-high is up one less to feed etc

 he came striding out of yesterday a red giant of
 a man-a robinson crusoe who had stuck his big
 hand into the whirlpool of contemporary history

 twenty-three years ago november second
  to be exact with the first world war fast
 approaching its climax newspapers in this country
 and abroad carried the following unconfirmed news item
 which came beyond a doubt via berlin

      new york nov -an unidentified source disclose that
    the s s belvedere enroute from buenos aires to marseille
    with a cargo of beef was torpedoed and sunk in the southern
    atlantic on august  the survivors escaped in two over-
    crowded life boats

    the winters snow made grotesque and distorted ramparts
  along washingtons busy streets it was noon and tens of
  thousands of government workers shivered in the chilly
  blasts of a sunless january day as they crowded into
  restaurants and drug stores for a hasty lunch

    several score of these hurrying pedestrians were all but
  trampled beneath thfe feet of an urgent giant who plunged
  with unfaltering gait through the thickest throngs he
  i paused but twice in his headlong dash between the union
  station and that far from pretentious edifice that houses
  the department of state each brief pause was to allow
  him to question an officer as to the exact location of the
  building that was his goal

    the tallest among the crowds through which he passed

three of them fought to pin down that
raging giant

were dwarfed by comparison he was more than just big
he was mammoth - had he bothered to cast his fierce blue
eyes downward he would have seen only the covered heads
of men and the bared heads of women

  his own fiery red hair gave the appearance of never
having been subjected to the ignominy of a hat his bushy
red eyebrows were puckered to form arches very much as
though their owner retained by some grim compelling re-
solve the determination to accomplish hft purpose

  his red unruly beard reaching well down upon his chest
concealed all of the lower part of his face his long apelike
arms extending inches of their redness well below the
sleeves of his ill-fitting coat brushed men and women alike
from his path with complete disregard

  his red seared hands were gripped into tight hamlike
pistons that sent any who thought to bar his way stepping
hastily aside quite as much by instinct as by the directions
he obtained from the guard in the corridor he made his
way to a secluded office on the third floor of the building

  actually though the door lintel was far from low he
ducked his massive head as he crossed the threshold

h

is voice when he spoke was in keeping with his fantastic
appearance it was rusty and each word creaked in

a different key like the tone of a church organ that has
been stored in a dusty attic for a score of years

  youve got to believe me he said to the small mild-
featured man who sat upright at the scarred desk though
he didnt say it quite as it had ever been said before

  the small gray man who had been a fixture while secre-
taries of state and secretaries of war and even presidents
came and went said evenly sit down

  that big red man performed the action of an uncivilized
man and a domesticated dog and turned completely around
in his tracks with the clear intention of sitting upon the
floor such a demonstration from any ordinary man would
have been funny even ridiculous it wasnt funny now
even the man at the desk didnt think it was funny he
pulled a chair forward with a quick movement of his small
white hand

  sit there he said and the big rfed man thanked him
with his eyes

  for a moment it almost seemed that he smiled but the
burnished red beard didnt part at his lips and the small
man at the desk got the impression that he was talking with
a man who had forgotten how to smile

  now he said evenly when the giant was seated op-
posite him what is it you want me to believe

  the big man hunched a little way forward in his chair
and his lips opened and closed soundlessly he drew his
breath into a chest that swelled gigantically and released
it in an enormous sigh his eyes still gleaming as they had
in the street with that uncivilized quality in their depths
shot this way and that about the room like primitive man
seeing four walls for the first time

  smoke the man at the desk tried to put him at his
ease and pushed the glass container of cigarettes across the
the scarred desk top

  the great hulking man stared hungrily for a moment
then he forced his eyes away as though he disciplined him-
self for some great ordeal no he said in that hoarse
creaky voice no i got out the habit

   the man at the desk took a cigarette and lit it casually
not so much because he wanted it as to increase the time
in which he would have an opportunity to study his visitor

  my name he said finally is gravecock youre sure
im the man you wanted to see

  you the giant said yes i asked in providence bos-
ton philadelphia he pronounced the names with the
awkward uncertainty of a schoolboy everyone said you
could help me

  all right gravecock said ill help if i can he
smiled invitingly

the big man raised a massive fist and for the first time
- gravecock saw that the thumb had been sheared off
at its base the big man looked at the scarred flesh which
clearly showed a botched amputation and seemed to draw
inspiration from what he saw there

  its hard to start the mans deep rusty voice broke
the silence there is so much he made a wideflung
gesture with his two hands as though encompassing a world
of events in what he wanted to say

  harry gravecock shifted restlessly a mild and con-
scientious man he had nevertheless to remember that there
was a second world war afoot if the man was some crank
tk ffloner he could rid himself of his presence the better

  he aecided to try a different tack most people arriving
in his office wanted a favor of some kirrd gf other he
said by way of experiment youre an american citizen
his tone made a question of it

  well-the red tanned forehead and craggy brows
went upward in a frown of concentration-well i dont
just know

  it was now harry gravecocks turn to sigh a nut he



thought pure and simple but why with all the hundred
offices he could have gone to come to him there was on
the desk before him a bell button that would summon one
of the guards from the corridor

  he was just extending his hand casually to avoid alarm-
ing a man who could become dangerous if aroused when
the big man said his voice still husky still creaky but
taking on a kind of singsong quality almost like a chant
as though he had said the same thing unnumbered times
there was a ship belvedere sailed from buenos aires
for marseille cargo of beef sunk by german submarine
second day out my father third officer came from bos-
ton was killed i lived he did not speak so much like
a man who wanted to save words as like a man who used
all the words that he knew

  harry gravecock studying the man as he talked drew
one conclusion the man wasnt a sailor he prided himself
on being able to classify the various visitors who came to
see him this time he had to admit that he was at a loss
though decidedly the man was not a sailor he didnt walk
like it or talk like it or look like it

  when was this harry gravecock asked certain that
no ship named belvedere had been sunk recently he shot
the question at his visitor

  nineteen seventeen the big man said in that same
deep rusty voice

  harry gravecock looked at his visitor for some sign of
humor there was none the answer had been given
apparently in all sincerity

  nineteen seventeen was a third of a lifetime behind him
gravecock said in his most placating tone you are cer-
tainly fortunate to be able to tell about it when were you
picked up

  belvedere belvedere-he tried desperately to remember
if he had ever heard anything about a ship by that name
the answer of the big red man brought him back to the
present with a brutal abruptness

  we were never picked up the big man said nine-
teen days in that boat his voice rose in pitch no food
no water my father dead resentment flared to hatred
in his voice his eyes he was suddenly like a violent de-
structive force held in check but insecurely

  but you harry gravecock persisted you were
picked up

the flaming passion died slowly from the mans eyes

     my second voyage he said seventeen years old
ten men drifted nineteen days all of them died other
days i drifted alone he made again that wide expressive
gesture that seemed to encompass so much two three
four i dont know he patted his corrugated brow with
his harsh toil-marked fingers

  crazy mad perhaps cursing germans cursing life
death god a tremor shook the big unwieldly frame

  you know he said and tried to smile again but failed
when i reached the island i thought i was dead coconut
milk-he shut his eyes as though to enjoy to the fullest
the ecstatic rapture that the milk had given him-sweet-
est thing ever tasted slept on the beach woke up boat
drifted away

  what island was that harry gravecock asked

  the big mans head shook in mournful regret never
knew- the name he said then his eyes brightened
map he said and sent an enquiring gaze about the room

  harry gravecock found an atlas and turned to a map
of the south atlantic with a sureness that spoke of some
familiarity with maps a big blunt reddened forefinger
hovered for an instant and descended to where a half-
dozen tiny pin points of black showed against the blue-
green coloring of the atlantic

  the mans story harry gravecock thought was on the

 face of it too implausible to be a lie he asked how long
 were you marooned

   the challenging savage eyes stared suspiciously count
 it he said abruptly as though tired of bsing played for
 something that he was not

   to what year harry gravecock asked and the answer
 when it came brought him up straighter in his chair
 nineteen forty the big man said

   when were you lorn harry gravecock decided upon
 another direct question and was immediately sorry for it
 the giants face darkened a look that was very near to
 primitive man flared for a moment in the deep-set eyes then
 that ponderous but inflexible will took hold and the man
 was almost civilized again

   friend he said choosing his words this time very
 carefully you cant trip me i tell you gods truth

   but you are here harry gravecock said once more
 the diplomat you must have got away finally

   yes he said shortly i did get away thats why
 im here you handle-well cases

   harry gravecock didnt smile he didnt think it would
 have been wise for any man to smile at the big mans
 simplicity but he saw a glimmer of light ahead he said
 guardedly you expect to enter a claim because of what
 happened twenty-three years ago

   not that the giant said not what you think he let
 his voice sink lower dont want any trouble had enough
 trouble his mutilated hand came slowly upward so that
 he spoke as much to his hand as he did to the man before
 him they said you would help me

   ill help you if i can harry gravecock said be
 brief give me just the vital facts im a week behind in my
 work now his friendliness took the sting from his words

 the big man combed his battered fingers through his
 hair and said pointedly living on an island alone
 like that everything is-what did you call it-vital
 harry gravecock nodded encouragingly and the big man
 settled himself more comfortably in his chair but the
 glance he cast on the floor at his feet was too obvious to be
 overlooked harry gravecock thoughtthat if it wasnt for
 the impression it would make on anyone coming in he
 would invite his visitor to make himself comfortable on the
 floor

   mister the red giant said i dont lie to nobody i
 liked it out there water coconuts birds eggs fish
 berries

   then at least you had a fire

   no no fire corrected the big man cold sometimes
 rainy season badj he gave a shrug that was neither non-
 chalant nor embarrassed and stooping rolled up the leg of
 his voluminous trousers harry gravecocks face was ex-
 pressionless as he saw a leg as hairy as that of any ape in
 the zoo i always was kind of hairy the giant said half-
  apologetically sun and rain raw food helped i guess
 in spite of his desire not to put too much faith in the
 mans story harry gravecock found himself accepting it

   lonesome at first scared too the husky deep voice
 rolled on caught a turtle made a pet of him name was
 george you know englishman lord george or something
 got chummy george and me lie out there nights plannin
 what wed do to the germans when we got a chance some-t
 times see a ships smoke way off then id pray that it
 would be american or english ship but they never came
 close enough for me to see

 - got tired doing nothing all time so thought of game i
 could play i set one rock to another and stained it to look
 like the face of the submarine commander then id throw
 stones till  knocked it over fun countin the stones
 getting better and better all time

   plenty of stones never ran short of stones then id

 set up bigger rocks and throw from farther away good
 fun lord george watching just like he knew huns we
 called them and summer and winter for twenty odd years
 i kept at it got so i could hit a bulls-eye nine times out
 of ten george liked it much as i did

   i used to throw thirty stones a day hot or cold rain or
shine i figured it thats nine hundred stones a month a
little over twenty-two years that makes almost a quarter
million stones fee flexed the biceps of his arm until the
muscles stood out like steel flanges

  and the ocean always bringing me in more stones o
throw i used to remember how my old man died and wish
that every one of them stones had hit a hun twenty-two
years is a long time to be killing huns and in the beginning
i prayed for a german ship not to come and in the end i
prayed for a shipload of huns so i could get even with
them

  well i was never a man who believed much in
prayer going to sea at seventeen but when i saw this boat
puttin in to the lee shore one day i was sorry id prayed
at all



the big red giant stood transfixed on the beach and
watched the boat come slowly nearer the desire to
run and hide was an all but overpowering one the turtle
beside him made sharp hissing sounds and moved pon-
derously to the waters edge and plunged in

   the boat came on and on and not until the bow grated
upon the beach and the six occupants waded warily ashore
did the islands single inhabitant free himself from the
spell that the boats approach had cast upon him

  he made deep rumbling sounds that barely resembled
words and with more instinct than thought he stooped
and gathered stones into his enormous hands one of the
men from the boat laughed disdainfully and leveled a gun
that he carried

  the big man knew guns and what they were for and
more than that he knew the men who had invaded his
sanctuary he looked at the leader the neat uniform
despite the inconvenience of an open boat the face clean-
shaven except for the small mustache and twenty-three
years dropped from his mind once again he was a boy
of seventeen made suddenly fatherless by an inhuman act

  it was not strange that he would remember the man
responsible for his fathers death and his own suffering
for more than twenty years he had been hurling stones
at that imaginary figure and now make-believe had become
suddenly real

   bell-the-deer he said in a whisper to himself and tried
to think why after half a lifetime the officer of the german
submarine should follow him here

   they tried speaking to him in different languages but
to each question he was able to answer only the one fhing
bell-the-deer he said over and over and his fierce eyes
challenged them	v

 an english swine the officer said bell the deer bell
the deer he mimicked and under his fluent tongue the
words took on new meaning the officer stopped speaking
and stared fixedly at the red hairy man theres some-
thing familiar about those words bell-the-deer bel-
vedere he repeated and snapped his fingers i liave it i
was- he stopped abruptly and approached the big man
with true german efficiency he got directly to the point
how long have you been here

  long the red giant repeated the word and made a
sweeping gesture that seemed to indicate immeasurable
time	

the officer laughed and the sound was echoed by his

men an iqliot he said maybe he heard about the
belvedere being sunk maybe he was on her does it mat-
ter he snapped a command at his men in german that
set them to unloading the boat there was a portable radio
but very little food and no clothing except whatt the men
wore

   the big man withdrew a wray along the beach watching
suspiciously for the first sign of hostility

   it was not a large island there was no possibility of
seven men living upon it without coming in close contact
with one another the red giant saw something that he
had missed before one of the men walked with a pro-
nounced limp and a second carried his right arm in a sling

  war the word came ur en from out the hazy past
and he mumbled it with the unamiliar concentration of a
child trying to remember a forgotten speech

  war the dry tinder of his dormant brain burst
ablaze as the full implication of the boat and its occupants
reached him

   in the beginning of his enforced exile he had dwelt often
upon the war and its possible outcome but for untold years
he had all but failed to connect his own condition with the
war the war for him had concentrated into a daily throw-
ing of stones at a make-believe enemy but all that had
changed with the coming of a boat the war was now
definitely something that he must take part in

   he watched the men under the officers directions set
up a temporary aerial and though the radio was no more
to him than a wireless set he recognized in it and its use a
distinct hazard without conscious thought of the eventual
outcome of such an act he rose and sent a stone crashing
into the delicate maze of tubes and wires v

   the germans speechless for a moment at the unexpected
disaster turned with cries of fury to where he stood war 
he cried and settled another stone securely into the cradle
of his enormous fingers

   the officer barked a command at his men and came alone
to where the red giant stood you fool he cried do you
think we want to rot here until we die-

  war the big man interrupted and only the small
sharp sound of the trigger on the germans gun when he
cocked it stopped him from making an attack

  so you know what that sound means perhaps youre
not a fool after all you british swine youve imprisoned
us here for god knows how long with your damned blunder-
ing but ybull pay for it

   bell-the-deer the big man said hoarsely

   belvedere the german mocked youll wish you had
gone down with her before im through with you

tn the days that followed the big man was able to
place vague meanings to the words that were addressed
to him he became a slave a surly unresponsive slave
waiting and watching for the opportunity when he would
be able to turn the tables on hi masters

   they ate with hungry relish the meager stores of food
that he had conserved against a day of want dried fruits
that he had learned to keep only after many dismal failures
they made jokes about and gorged themselves until they
could hold no more

   it was george coming lazily across the oeach in search
of the red giant who brought the vowed hostility into
open conflict the big man stooped at one of his endless
tasks was unaware of the turtles approach until he heard
the crack of the shot his sharp fierce eyes saw the friend
of his long imprisonment rise upward on short stubby legs
then sink flat upon the sand

   the cry that came from the red giants throat was such
that the cloak of civilization was thrown backward for ten
thousand years and with the sure instinct of a man long
dependent upon intuition to guide him he sent one of his

ever-present stone-missiles at the man who held the gun

  the crack that followed was not the sharp crack of a
rifle shot but rather the soft meaty sound of a ripe coconut
knocked hard against a rock there was no answering cry
of pain from the man who had been struck by the stone
with a slow swaying motion he turned half about and
dropped limp upon the sand

  the big man moved in a hlf-crouching run and like a
pack of wolves upon the trail of a buck the sailors took up
the chase

   the red giartts action instinctive as it had been was not
that of a blundering fool there was sanctuary if he could
reach it a cave all but invisible from either land or sea
he had found it years and years before during one of his
endless attempts to catch fish with his bare hands with
all the cunning of the wild animal that he had so nearly
become he dived into the sea and swimming under water
attained the safety of the cave

  the night through he sat his huge red shoulders all but
touching the low ceiling of the cave thinking was not easy
for him because his actions had for so long been purely
instincts of an intelligent animal yet the power to think
and reason was not dead and out of the chaos of his new
danger came the realization that complete safety could
come only with the destruction of the invaders

  long accustomed to eating food cured in the sun he
found it no hardship to be deprived of the doubtful bene-
fits of the fire that the germans had brought with them
during the day that followed he made short journeys from
the cave watching with only his head above water the
activity of the men about the camp

  they still worked perseveringly with the radio that he
had all but demolished but-he saw too that they took no
chances of having him return and surprise them with
military exactitude a sentry patrolled the beach between
the stranded boat and the camp

  by midday he had made complete plans for his ifijst
campaign and returned to the cave where he slept the long
afternoon away it was only with darkness that he ven-
tured to swim close beside the boat and creep within its
shadow to the beach

the sentry pausing only to throw the precious drift-

  wood on the small fire stalked up and down near where
the others reclined upon the sand

  there was no room the red giant knew for failure and
so with the patience of a man who has forgotten any time-
piece except the sun any calendar except the equinoxes
he waited after more than a score of years waiting had
grown to be an expected ingredient of living

   the mocfn came up to cast a faint glimmering light upon
the sea and upon the sand the crouching form in the
shadow of the boat drew further back into the concealing
darkness and watched with fierce savage eyes the pacing
figure

  all other movement on the beach had ceased while his
four companions slept the single sentry moved endlessly
a cloud like a concealing curtain swept across the moon
and when the silver sheen descended again upon the beach
no sentry paced before the meager fire

  the big red man still crouched in the shadow of the boat
and so swift had been his motions as he sent the deadly
missile speeding to its mark it hardly seemed that he had
moved at all 

  he waited until the first gray dawn flecked the eastern
sky before he slipped into the friendly concealing waters
and returned to his cave

  from far out at sea that day he watched the unceasing
search of the invaders had he know how to laugh he
would have laughed at their futile efforts to find some trace
of his having been there

   that night he returned and saw undismayed that there
 was a bigger fire and that two sentries instead of one paced
 the beach with guns held at the ready low-hung clouds
 veiled the moon and so still was the big mans form beside
 the boat he all but became a part of it

   the fire waned and was refueled a score of times and
 the two sentries as the night advanced spend more and
 more time in close association with each other they made
 shorter and shorter journeys beyond the firelight when the
 big red naked form stood erect it was soundless as a wisp
 of mist from off the sea

   the arm that was like a cable of twisted steel went back
 and when at last the missile sped it was with the crushing
 irresistible force of a cannon ball the only sound that
 marked the sentrys death was the clatter of his rifle as it
 fell to the sand

   instantly the quiet was broken by the alarmed ry of
 the other sentry then the two men asleep before the fire
 were on their feet

   like some huge sea animal the red giant slipped silently
 into the water and when a safe distance from shore he sent
 a single challenging cry bell-ve-deer but before the
 hail of lead could rake the spot he was already far beneath
 the surface moving swiftly for the shelter of his cave

 very very slowly his mind was being lud into new
 and untried paths one conclusion brooked no argu-
 ment these invaders were the enemies of his people and
 his country they and others like them had been respon-
 sible for his fathers death

   they had killed wantonly his companion lord george
 they would kill him with unmerciful tortufe if they were
 given the opportunity to survive he must remove them
 completely with these thoughts coursing through his
 mind he returned to his haven and after eating some dried
 coconut meat went to sleep

   it was the next day that he overplayed his hand he had
 the instinctive cunning of an animal and he had relied
 upon his instinct too long to desert it now for reason he
 swam leisurely at midmorning far out from the island and
 nowhere could he see a single gign of life for hours he
 floated there now in now half out of the water and his
 sharp eyes scanned foot by foot the entire island dwelling
 particularly upon tie boat and the beach near it

   the island appeared to be just as he had always known
 it no plume of smoke no pacing figure instinct told him
 that something was wrong but reason failed to give any
 clear definition as to what it was

   the sun was long past the zenith when he set foot at
 last upon the sandy bottom and waded up the shelving
 beach guns were to him something to be wary of but
 he had no fear of them he found and paused beside the
 three graves where the dead men had been buried

   he felt with his huge red hairy hand the cold ashes of
 the fire made casual examination of the deserted boat it
 was all very strange and mystifying he thought vaguely
 but many strange things had happened in recent days so
 he accepted this too

   after an hour during which he covered in his long tire-
 less lope the full length of the island he entered the sea
 and swam easily to the barely discernible mouth of his
 cave

   instinct and reason alike had deserted him now for the
 cave had been his one safe refuge for so long he had never
 considered its possible discovery by those who were search-
 ing for him

   he crawled through the entrance on hands and knees
 a smaller man might have entered by merely stooping
 then as some faint warning signal burst in his brain he
 felt the rough hands of the waiting men clutch at his body

   it was one to three but if he had failed to estimate their

 cunning they had failed too to estimate his strength
 with the rage of  a giant gorilla gone berserk he hurled
 them from him and did not know that they fought with
 knives as well as fists until the dull bite of one caught him
 in the side

   they might have killed him and would have except that
they had left their guns behind feeling confident perhaps
that three men armed with knives could more than match
the strength of any man

  they all but did and blood flowed from a score of
wounds before two of them lay with broken necks

  the third man battered and weak lurched from the
blackness of the cave to the sun-warmed waters and the
red giant let him go thinking that the battle could now
be ended at his leisure

   he slept that night fitfully not being sure now that he
was safe from his enemy at daylight he came to the sur-
face of the sea and for the first time in his life he was
afraid the boat was gone

had it been one of the seamen who had escaped he
would perhaps have let him go but neither of the
two men in the cave whom he had thrown to the fishes
had been the officer somewhere deep in the reasoning
power that was awakening in his brain was the idea that
this officer had come out of his past just to kill him

   he had failed once with the sinking of the belvedere
now he had failed again but when he came next time
he would make sure the red giant climbed upon the
islands higfiest point and then far far out at sea a tiny
speck caught and held his savage stare

   tired and aching from his struggle weak from loss of
blood he was almost willing to let the officer escape but
hate twenty-three years of hating was not so easily dis-
carded the boat was large too large for one man to han-
dle with any ease

   his eyes were hard and cold and bright with determina-
tion when he limped down to the waters edge and plunged
in

   all through those long grueling hours the bearded giant
moved on the unmarked track of the fleeing boat sunset
at last and darkness and with its final shadows any
thought of being able to return deserted his mind but the
silvery shimmer of moonlight made it possible to see the
black dot that was the boat with all the ease of noontime

   the boat drifted with the tiniest of winds to help it
and the big fnan moving now with the slackened pace of
a spent athlete came nearer and nearer

   at long long last a hairy brine-bleached hand came up
and clutched the gunwale there was no sound there was
scarcely any movement but the sleeping man awoke and
the gun lying ready to his hand moved with deadly swift-
ness

  war the red giant whispered and though the gun
flashed in his face his fingers had closed upon his enemy

   it was a silent bitter struggle with odds favoring first
one then the other with the regularity of a clock ticking
the big man after the long hours in the water was tired
to the point of exhaustion but the older mans advantages
were of short duration because forty can call up resources
that sixty will never know again

  had the red giant known compassion he might have
allowed his enemy to live but twenty years of hating had
killed all else and when the germans body was pushed
overside it floated briefly nd disappeared

   the big man lay exhausted until the rising sun revived
him and there was no island then onall the smooth bright
surface of the sea he knew later in the day that he was
sick but he didnt know why and before the sun went
down he was talking gibberish to himself as he tossed
feverishly

do any talking till i got back here to america took me
months to get so i could really talk again

  its a pretty mess harry gravecpck said by the
way you never did tell me your name

  gallinger red gallinger theres my side of it too
he defended there is a war even though we aint in it
yet and if i hadnt killed them theyd killed me they did
kill lord george

  one huge red hand disappeared into a coat pocket and
harry gravecock expected him to produce a handkerchief
in proportion but it wasnt a handkerchief he brought
out it was a strip of blue serge such as might have come
off an officers cap there was gold lettering on it harry
gravecock reached for it quickly

  von stressburg the name had been too much in the
news the previous winter to be easily forgotten

  harry gravecock reached for one of the phones on his
desk ten minutes later he had the information he wanted
the belvedere had sailed from buenos aires twenty-three
years before and had been torpedoed and sunk no mem-
ber of the crew had ever been saved the thing that brought

harry gravecock upright in his chair was the information
that there had been two members of the crew named gal-
linger father and son

  the von strassburg had engaged in a running fight with
a british man-of-war and the british admiralty had re-
ported her badly damaged this engagement had taken
place the previous april if she had exploded and sunk it
might well mean that the six members of the crew that
gallinger had seen were the sole survivors

  harry gravecock put the phone back on the hook
everything seems to check up he said but youre an
american citizen and this country is not at war with ger-
many the right eye in the gray lined face of the older
man dropped significantly just what do you want me
to do

  red gallinger became meek for the first time he put
his finger on the little pin points that indicated islands
on the map its goodish far out there he said but

if you could just see your way clear to sending me back

i dont like it here mister i want to get back to where a
mans got some comforts

  two days later red gallinger sailed from new york in
a british-owned vessel for a destination that he pointed out
to the captain with a blunt hairy forefinger

  that night the new york papers and others carried a

young shad gibson the owner of the half-circle
g ranch is determined to kill black bob huntoon
for huntoon has framed a charge of cattle-rustlihg
against him but on riding to the huntoon place shad 
finds that the job has been done by some one else
huntoon is dead shot through the back the fact that
the body is seated at a table with cards spread out
before n dees not convince shad that huntoon was
killed where he now sits the scene is too obviously ar-
ranged

  shad gibson points this out to deputy-sherift burt
thrasher but the big deputy a close friend of hun-
toons says the case is clear enough shad gibson an-
nounced he would kill huntoon shad committed the
murder so shad is under arrest

  bitterly angry he asks lovely rita wagner to investi-
gate the framed murder but thrasher tells her to stay
out of it or her brother will be in trouble knowing
that wild tom wagner has been running outside the
law shad decides he must protect the boy so he calmly
confesses to the murder of bob huntoon the justice
of the peace is miles huntoon the dead mans brother
and shad can expect no leniency from him

one of shads most loyal friends is pat connity an

 alcoholic irish lawyer and when pat hears the story
of shads arrest and false confession he takes matters
in his own hands through rita wagner he gets in
touch with pecos driscoll foreman of the wagner
ranch that night driscoll breaks shad gibson out of
iail

  an old partner of shads father driscoll now reveals
to shad that bill gibsons death a few years before was

not an accident but murder and old pete wagner he
says was shot down by four white men driscolls shrewd
guess isthat the two murders were connected with the
smuggling of cattle across the mexican border both
the gibson and wagner ranches stretch along the
border but their owners have never permitted wet beef
to be shoved across illegally

  pat connity and driscoll believe that the time has
come to smash the rustling combine connitys scheme
is for shad gibson to ride into mexico to the rancho of
don pablo vidal who is known to have a hand in the
cattle-smuggling right now young tom wagner must
be down there for the boy is infatuated with don pab-
los daughter rosita called the golden rose taking
refuge at the vidal rancho shad should be able to learn
something about the huntoon murder

on the trail into mexico shad catches sight of a soaked
bundle which turns out to be the jacket of black
bob huntoon apparently it was cached in the hills
only to be washed down here by the heavy rains and it
proves that huntoon was not murdered in his shack
but theres more to it than that for wrapped in the
jacket is a money belt containing ten thousand dollars

    the money belt strapped around his waist shad
gibson arrives at the vidal hacienda to be greeted
warmly by don pablo but after a rest shad finds a
curious change in his hosts manner and it is soon evi-
dent that don pablo has been informed fully about the
huntoon murder he tells shad there is a ten-thousand-
dollar reward for his capture but not a state reward-
a private matter perhaps senor gibson can understand
why the sum is precisely ten thousand dollars-no more

wet beef from mexico



no less don pablo then must know of the money belt

  shad expects gunplay but the entry of rosita pre-
vents that she is charming to shad and that night she
takes him for a stroll but shad is on guard and when
the golden rose contrives to fall into his arms he is
aware of her hands searching for and finding his money
belt then their embrace is suddenly interrupted a
hoarse voice cries out you she-devil you two-headed
snake lyin to my sister-makin love to my girl ill
kill you both 

chapter v

dagger of the rose

it was wild young tom wagner a split-second be-
fore his gun roared shad threw rosita over backward
and behind the thick bent trunk of the live-oak tree
he went over after her jerking out his gun

  tom wagners bullet grazed shads ear the drunken
young cowman was coming toward the tree at a lurching
run shooting wildly as he came shad crouched in front
of the girl gripping his gun bullets thudded into the tree
trunk and whined past his head the tree trunk giving
him and the cowering girl a barricade

  shad counted the shots four five six then he
jumped clearing the bent tree trunk charging young
tom wagner who stood there on unsteady legs a smoking
empty six-shooter in his hand

  shad swung his six-shooter like a club its long barrel
thudded against the side of tom wagners head knocking
him down shad was on top of the fallen dazed man roll-
ing him over on his face yanking his arms behind him ty-
ing his wrists behind his back with the silk neckscarf he
tore from the young cowmans throat

  he heard a sound behind him and threw himself side-
ways and onto his feet he grabbed rositas arm spun
her around roughly twisted her wrist behind her back in a
hammerlock his hand took the long thin-bladed knife
from her hand then he let her go and grinned

  rosita was breathing like a spent runner her golden
eyes looked reddish in the moonlight the blood was
drained from her face leaving her golden skin almost
chalky white

  gringo she spat at him fool

  i dont reckon i have too much sense at that he
grinned at her i dont know which of us you aimed to
shove that pig sticker into

  shad caught a brief glimpse of a man dodging back into
the black shadow of some brush he jumped in behind the
bent trunk of the wishing tree cocking his six-shooter

   come out from behind that brush or ill start shootin
shad barked harshly pronto

  you all right shad the man behind the brush called
out shad gave a start as he recognized the lazy texan
drawl of pecos driscoll

  if you are theres no need me coinin out dont call
me by name

  im all right i had to knock tom wagner cold hes
cornin alive again i got his hands tied behind his back

  ill be gittin along shad i got me a wolf trapped
back in the hills sober tom up and make him talk
so long

  rosita vidal had regained something of her composure
she brushed leaves and some dirt from her mexican peas-
ant dress and her white teeth flashed in a smile

  shad saw pecos driscoll vanish into the night get his
horse and ride away tom wagner groaned tried to get to
his feet and couldnt make it he commenced cussing as he
sought to free his hands

  rosita held out her hand toward shad id like to have
my knife back i promise not to use it i lost my temper

for a minute i have you to thank for saving my life
tomas is muy borrochon too locoed drunk to know what
he was doing he needs a cold bath and some sleep

  poor tomas when he is not drunk he can be very
sweet give me the knife and i will cut his hands free and
we will all go to the house no the sound of shooting will
be alarming don pablo he and his vaqueros will be com-
ing any minute now

  shad shoved the knife into his red silk sash and picked
up tom wagners empty gun he ejected the empty shells
and re-loaded the six-shooter

  ill give you back your knife later rosita and when
tom here gits sobered up be kin have his gun back

shad reached down and yanked tom wagner to his
feet tom was tall and slim with reddish hair and
gray-brown eyes that were bloodshot and congested pow
from whisky and lack of sleep a stubble of reddish beard
marred his almost too handsome young face

  tom kicked savagqjy at shad lost his balance and would
have fallen over backward if shad had not grabbed him by
the collar of his denim brush-jacket he slapped tom twice
across the face with the palm of his hand

  if you were sober and any kind of a man id give you
the damndest fist whippin a young fool ever got where
have you bin for a week youd better have a good alibi
young rooster otherwise youll hang for the murder of
black bob huntoon talk fast and talk straight

  bob huntoon dead wild young tom wagners
drunken fluster was gone he looked sick and scared and
bewildered then something almost like tremendous relief
showed on his unshaven face but sullen anger overcame his
other emotions his bloodshot eyes glared at the girl his
mouth twisted in a sneering grin

  tell your tow-headed lover where ive been for the
past week he snarled at her

  men on horseback were coming from the direction of
the ranch the voice of don patio could be heard shout-
ing orders

  scatter out hombres search the brush take the
gringo gibson alive if any harm has come to my daugh-
ter i want to torture that gringo until his screams will be
heard in hell he was shouting in staccato mexican

  better holler out that youre all right and for him to
call off his hombres shad spoke to rosita otherwise
therell be some dead mexicans eating breakfast in that
same hell hes hollerin about and my first shot will knock
don pablo out of his saddle im playin for keeps if you
want to save your fathers life start hollerin

  shad gibson had a six-shooter in each hand he had
stepped in behind the twisted curved trunk of the wishing
tree his voice was brittle his lips were pulled flat in a
mirthless grin

  papa papa mio send the vaqueros back i am all
right nobody has been hurt nothing is wrong ride
back to the house papa the shooting was an accident a
mistake nobody is hurt ride back and take the vaqueros
with you pronto or perhaps you will spoil everything
nobody has hurt your daughter don pablo nobody
has been shot there kre only some bullets in rositas
wishing tree no harm has been done

  don pablo had drunk too much before supper and after-
ward he was drunk enough to want to use his gun

  tom wagner had been drinking hard for a week he
might make a fool of himself he started to shout some-
thing shad yanked him in behind the tree and his gun
barrel thudded down across the young cowmans head he
dragged toms unconscious form in behind the brush and
motioned rosita to sit on the trunk of the wishing tree
he sat down beside her

  play your part chiquita he said as they watched don
pablo riding alone toward them or your good mother will
be a widow ill shoot first and shoot to kill tell him we
wished on the rising moon if you love your father rosita
make a quick wish now that a tow-headed gringo will
spare his life

don pablo rode up at a run sliding his horse to a halt
he was wearing his shabby brown leather charro
clothes and the sombrero ornamented with silver and gold
he was fully clothed even to his spurs don pablo who
should have been in bed had not dressed hastilyhe had
been dressed and ready to make a night ride in his hand
was one of his silver-handled beautifully etched six-shoot-
ers which he wore when he rode on any sort of business
that took him from his hacienda

  madre de dios papa laughed rosita put away
that gun ride back to the house

  there was shooting who was killed don pablos
voice was harsh his black eyes glittered in the shadow of
his big sombrero

  the shooting was harmless nobody was shot rositas
laugh was soft and almost genuine

  who were you expectin to be shot don pablo
  has that gringo burt thrasher-

  burt thrasher has not been here papa

  but you expected him no shad grinned

  don pablo stared hard at his daughter and this tow-
headed grinning gringo with no little effott he regained
what calm he could summon out of an alcoholic rage

  you are wanted by the gringo law my amigo the
mexican border does not stop man hunters like burt
thrasher i promised you protection i heard shooting
there is the matter of a ten-thousand-dollar reward

  and there is the matter senor said shad gibson of
the murder of black bob huntoon i did not kill bob
huntoon neither did tom wagner i would give ten thou-
sand dollars myself to know who murdered bob
huntoon

  and now said rosita vidal i think we are getting
somewhere ride on back home papa the man who
killed bob huntoon robbed you of ten thousand dollars i
think i can tell shad gibson who killed bob huntoon
now ride back papa i think perhaps that burt thrasher
is back in the mountains caught in a wolf trap

  por dios child exploded don pablo i hope you
are not moon locoed that you have not forgotten that
you are the daughter of pablo vidal you would not sell
out your own father to a gringo

  i want to talk to shad alone papa when i sell you
out to anybody i hope to lose my soul forever have i
ever failed you papacito

  no no repeated don pablo heavily he reined his
horse and rode back the way he had come muttering
shaking his head

  whew shad grinned at the golden rose of san luis
and any second i was scared tom would come awake
and start a fuss and wed be sunk hes stirrin now

  shad gave rosita her pearl-handled dagger

  cut tom loose keep your knife was don pablo
robbed of ten thousand dollars

  yes

  if you got back that ten thousand dollars for your fa-
ther would you tell me the name of the man who killed-
rosita shook her head tightened a hand over shads
arm and pressed close to him-dangerously close

  not for ten thousand dollars not for anything but
something that money cannot buy i love you shad mar-
ry me and i will tell you who killed bob huntoon i will
tell you who killed your father bill gibson

shad caught his breath like a man who has been hit
hard this was the golden rose of san luis men
had fought to the death to win her smiles she was the
most beautiful woman shad had even seen there had been
a time in his life when he had been willing to fight any-
thing or anybody to win her love then there had been a
swift and bitter quarrel

  what had been a mad infatuation on shad gibsons
part had turned to a sort of loathing and contempt and
hatred and after that he had met rita wagner and
found what he knew to be a wholesome and splendid and
loyal friendship between a woman and man which had
slcwly ripened into the sort of love that a cowpuncher
dreams about

 and now this this calling him back to that infatua-
tion for a mexican senorita who had laughed while men
fought and killed one another to see who would win her
deceptive smiles

  shad had worshipped his father bill gibson had been
more like an older brother that a youngster idealizes
hero worship is a small name for the bond that had al-
ways been between square bill gibson and his son shad-
rock if rosita vidal could tell him who had murdered
bill gibson then bob huntoon then   

  its a deal rosita all i want is a chance to kill the
man who murdered my father to clear my name of a
murder charge dont matter so much i have the money
that bob huntoon was packin when he was shot in the
back it goes to whoever it belongs to i shore dont
want it

  but i dont aim to have it taken off me by an kind of
force let don pablo prove his ownership knd the moneys
his alb im after is a shot at the man that killed bill
gibson

  theres a padrex at the ranch and i reckon any man
along the mexican border would call me the luckiest hom-
bre in the world to be marryin the golden rose of san
luis-

  rosita vidals soft laugh was in shads ears she kissed
him swiftly then the knife in her hand she went into the
brush shad followed her still dazed by the sudden turn of
things he was trying to get used to the sudden fact that
he was going to marry rosita vidal that all the dreams
and hopes that he had shared with rita wagner were
broken and shattered

  shad saw rosita kneel beside tom wagner who lay on
the ground his hands tied behind him he saw her knife
slit the silk neck handkerchief that bound tom wagners
hands then the blade raised as if to strike tom wagner
twisting rolling grabbing the hand that held the knife
tom wagner teeth bred eyes like burning coals rushing
shad the knife in his hand words ripped from a dry tor-
tured throat words that called rosita vidal and shad
gibson fighting names

  whisky and rage giving wild young tom wagner the
strength of ten men for a few brief minutes

  tom wagner was tall and slim and hard-muscled the
knife in his hand stabbed and ripped as it struck hitting
bone the slender blade snapped at the hilt tom wag-
ners head struck shads jaw then shad felt a thudding
blow on his head and the roar of a gun was in his ears
everything went black

   shad gibson was out as cold as a rock blood spilled from
the stab wound in his left shoulder the broken blade of a
dagger protruded an inch or two above his borrowed white
silk shirt and leather charro jacket there were powder
burns on shads straw-colored hair where a six-shooter had
exploded as the barrel crashed against his skull and the
hair-triggered gun had tripped and fired the cartridge that
had grazed shads skull

drawl sifted through that black oblivion take er easy
son you got a thick skull and you dont bleed easy but
you shore look like the man that was sent for and couldnt
git there hells about to pop and you dont want to miss
out on the big fireworks

   it was the lazy texan drawl of pecos driscoll

   shad explained briefly about the brush-jacket with the
bullet hole in the back

    its tied to my saddle bob huntoons brush-jacket
   it was tied to your saddle don pablo has it now and

i	reckon the rosita lady got the money belt i saw her
fussin over you when you was knocked out and i was
draggin tom down the crick your shirt is pulled out and
that red sash tore off you rosita vidal collected that
money for her old man

   she claimed it belonged to don pablo

   then pecos driscoll grinned twistedly don pablo
is the man thats bin holdin young tom wagner for ran-
som down here in mexico thats where tom has bin for
a week unless hes lyin to cover up some ornery thing hes
ashamed of

   he claims that rosita out-foxed the mexican outlaws
that had him hid back in the hills under guard that she
got him free about noon and fetched him to the vidal ranch
she had him hid out somewhere in the house he claims
his likker was doped that he woke up and saw her walk-
in off with you in the dark

  he cold-trailed you lost his head and went plumb
locoed hes coolin off and gittin sober ten minutes or
so and hell make sense but hes still dead stuck on
rosita i told him you was makin a play at her just to
learn what could be learned find out anything

   rosita knows who killed my father she wants to mar-
ry me

   not the way i figger it she wanted to see you and tom
fight she let tom overhear you two a-talkin about gittin
married then she got her knife back and cut tom loose
and let him grab the knife shes tricky she wanted that
money you was packin

   she shore got it said shad grimly

pecos said he reckoned that young tom wagner was
cold sober by now they went down the creek to where
pecos had tied tom down in the creek

   got a-plenty tom asked pecos

   im waterlogged and chilled and twice as sober as a
 preacher the orneriness is drug outa me pecos honest
 shad ive acted like a damned fool pecos has told me
 about a few things

   tom dripping wet shivering stood on the creek bank
 pecos fired questions at the sodden and bruised young
 cowman

   black bob huntoon had a money belt with ten thou-
 sand dollars in it when he was killed on the trail between
 his place andthe vidal ranch what do you know about it
 tom

   its not any too clear pecos said tom wagner i
 lost a lot of money to don pablo gamblin down here
 about ten thousand dollars  got half sober and decided
 to pull out for home get baa to town in time to stop pay-
 ment on the checks id written but if you think you kin
 ride away from the vidal rancaat night when don pablo
 dont want you to go just try 

   i was stopped at the barn before i could git my horse
 don pablos men fetched me back to the house i felt as
 cheap as a plugged dobe peso

    my young friend don pablo says in his oiliest voice
 could it be possible that you are running away in the
 night that you have some notion of stopping payment on
 your checks dont you know that between real men a
 gambling debt is a debt of honor

   im not a strong character tom wagner went on bit-
 terly i told don pablo that i was ashamed to have my
 sister know id gambled away ten thousand dollars

   he turned fatherly right then said that he understood
 how i felt but that a debt of honor was something that
 had to be paid regardless and he poured me a drink

   he had a plan he said that would get him his ten
 thousand dollars and at the same time save me from the
 disgrace of tellin my sister id gambled away that money
 his mexicans would take me into the hills i would send a
 note to miles huntoon sayin that i had bin captured by
 mexican bandits and was bein held for ransom i would
 make out a check to cash don pablo would send the
 check and note to campo by black bob huntoon who was
 at the vidal ranch with me dickerin for stolen cattle

   the idea sounded like the one and only way out i
 wrote the letter and made out a check for ten thousand dol-
 lars gavethe check and letter to black bob huntoon to
 deliver to miles huntoon at campo then i rode off into
 the hills with a couple of don pablos vaquero cattle
 rustlers	

   and thats where ive bin for the past week finished
 tom wagner yesterday rosita showed up and said don
 pablo had sent for me we rode back to the vidal ranch
 together	

   she said that somethin had gone wrong she didnt
 know just what don pablo would talk it over with me
 later we rode in by a back trail and she smuggled me into
 the house she made me promise to stay in my room she
 said you were at the ranch dickerin with don pablo for a
 secret gate to be put in your border fence

   i was all in worry and not much sleep and id bin
 drunk for a week on mescal and tequila the drink she
 gave me tasted queer bitter she said there was somethin
 in it to make me sleep i drank part of it and spilled the
 rest out the window

   she thought i was asleep drugged but i heard her
 ask you to go with her to her wishin tree to watch the moon
 rise i trailed you there i damned near killed you both
 im still crazy jealous about her ill git over it rosita

vidal is the most beautiful girl in the world but shes colder
blooded than old don pablo treacherous as a golden tiger
better forgit her for a spell tom said pecos we
got some chores to do you and me and shad here burt
thrasher and one or two of his hired hands have trailed
shad here theyre at the vidal ranch right now we dont
know who killed black fob huntoon but id gamble that
thrashers the man who waylaid black bob who was fetch-
in that ten thousand dollars to don pablo

  thrashers scared of miles huntoon he hid the money
in black bobs jumper packed bobs dead carcass to his
cabin planted it there to trap shad thrasher had to kill
bob huntoons dog to git iiito the cabin he knowed that
shad was goin to fight it out with black bob where he
found that black-headed cattle thief because black bob
huntoon had told rita wagner that if she didnt marry
him hed send her brother to the pen at yuma

  thrasher had to work fast i think you almost caught
him red handed there at the cabin when he set bob
huntoons dead body in a chair dealt some cards to make it
look like bob huntoon had bin playin solitaire thrasher
forgot to pull off the dead mans gloves he got outa the
cabin circled around met shad when he was ridin away
from the bob huntoon place and arrested shad for murder

  thrasher come back to find that money i sighted him
huntin all over the brush for it if he finds out that rosita
vidal or don pablo has that ten thousand dollars he mur-
dered a man to git then thrasher might not hesitate to do
some more killin

  hes at the vidal ranch right now rosita wasnt half
as clever as she figgered when she took that money belt
let burt thrasher find her with it and that money belt is
the golden rose of san luis death warrant wed better
be movin heres your six-shooter tom youre goin to
need it

  rosita knows who killed bill gibson and pete wag-
ner said shad i aim to make her tell me you think
it was burt thrasher pecos

  burt thrasher and the two huntoons miles htfntoon
engineered the two killins hes the brains black bob
and burt thrasher done the actual work thats my guess

  and im bettin that don pablo knows the story that
backs up that guess of mine so lets git goin i dont
know how big the odds are stacked agin us but were
tacklin em  pecos driscoll and the sons of bill gib-
son and pete wagner lets go boys

they made a strange looking trio as they went on foot
through the park of live-oak trees tall lanky homely
pecos driscoll in his faded old overalls and short denim
brush jacket a head taller than either of hisvyounger
companions his legs were bowed and he walked with the
stiff-legged gait of an old time cowhand battered hat pulled
atan angle across his head cartridge belt and holstered
six-shooter slanted across his lean flanks awkward on foot
but dangerous nevertheless

  young tom wagner his cowpuncher clothes still sod-
den boots squishing with every step from wet socks shiv-
ering a little nerves on edge from his sudden and drastic
sobering up a desperate glint in his bloodshot eyes as he
limped along	

  shad gibson in bloodstained leather charro clothes and
bloody white silk shirt hatless bandaged a twisted grin
on his face he walked his gait easy sure-footed his hand
brushing the butt of his holstered gun

  they were still a couple of hundred yards from the cor-
rals and adobe buildings that showed plainly in the moon-
light when they heard the sudden sound of shooting men
were cursing in two languages suddenly horses bolted
into the night with empty saddles then a couple of badly

scared mexican vaqueros were spurring and whipping their
horses to a dead run as they headed for the open country
beyond there was the shrill and terrified scream of a
woman the scream choked off abruptly

   kill the damned greaser we got the doublecrossin old
paisano- watch that she-hellcat boys shell knife you

  pecos gripped young tom wagners arm holding him
back he growled a warning as he pulled his gun

   hold on tom take er steddy we wont win a damn
thing by chargin em thats burt thrasher a-hollerin
hes got his tough hands with im

  guns popped men yelled hoarsely mexican women
and children were shouting frightened panicky doors
slammed shut dogs barked burt thrashers half dozen
tough hands were riding around shooting off their six-
shooters burt thrasher killer and cattle rustler was
taking over the san luis rancho

   hes either locoed or drunk or hes got an ace in the
hole growled pecos driscoll burt thrasher and his
renegade deputies is shore bustin things wide open keep
to the shadows boys foller me

  burt thrashers men had located don pablos wine
cellar they were getting drunk shooting off their guns
driving the mexican families into the inadequate shelter
of their little adobe homes the men rode their horses
back and forth as they waved bottles and brandished six-
shooters and carbines

  i count six of emsaid pecos how many do you
boys tally

   it was hard to get the exact count on the gringo raid-
ers shad said he reckoned pecos tally was right

   i cant stand much more of that pecos if they start
hurtin women and kids im cuttin loose

  take er easy shad tuck in your shirttail cau-
tioned pecos as they ran and dodged through brush and
between buildings and corrals keeping as much as they
could to the black shadows

   theyll git their drinkin done added pecos afore
they git wild enough to harm the wimmen thatll take
some time-

  young tom wagner gave a grunting cry he had seen
one of the riders trying to ride down a woman with a baby
in her arms but it was pecos driscolls six-shooter that
blotted out toms curse

  the tipsy rider swayed drunkenly in his saddle the
horse whirled lunged forward head swinging as its rider
toppled sideways from his saddle and hit the ground with a
thud the man lay there in a motionless heap a shattered
bottle gripped in his dead hand

   you know how to git into the house tom said pecos
ejecting the smoking shell from his six-shooter and shoving
a cartridge into the empty chamber lead the way git
nobody noticed what happened were still lucky

rpom wagner led them at a run the three went into
j- the rambling adobe house by a side door shad knew his
bearings at the end of a arched corridor which was lighted
by candles in wall niches was the private office and smok-
ing room of don pablo

   from behind the closed door of carved black oak came
the muffled sound of voices the dead bodies of two of
don pablos vaqueros lay in the corridor one of burt
thrashers gringos was squatted on his heels his back to
them trying to twist the cork out of a bottle with the blade
of his jack-knife

   shad gibson covered that fifteen feet of dimly lighted
corridor with a couple of long leaps the man twisted
around shad landed on topof him gun barrel swinging
the gun thudded against the mans head with a sickening
crack that shattered bone the man went limp pecos and

                                 -argosy-april - 
wet beef from mexico



 tom wagner were right behind shad as he got to his feet
 the mans six-shooter in his left hand

   pecos had taken the guns of the two dead vaqueros he
 handed one six-shooter to tom and kept the other they
 halted at the closed door crouching listening watching
 the corridor

   burt thrashers harsh voice sounded clearly from with-
 in the room beyond the closed door

   this is the payoff vidal you got that ten thousand
 dollars before igit done with you youll beg for a
 chance to tell me what you done with it

   pull his boots off toys then roast his bare feet with
 that candle if that dont work well start n on don

 face was drained of blood he started to open the door

   steady sons 

   pecos driscolls homely face twisted in an ugly grin
 he kicked the door wide open he went in fighting shad
 gibson and young tom wagner at his back

chapter vii

hands are weapons

shad gibson saw don pablo tied in his chair his
boots pulled off a man on one knee with a lighted
candle that he was holding against the mexicans bare
f feet

   on the other side of the room senora vidal and rosita
 were sitting in chairs arms tied behind their backs two

 renegade white men with six-shooters stood guard over
 them

  burt thrasher sat on the desk one spurred boot touch-
ing the floor the other leg swinging a bottle of whisky
in one hand six-shooter in the other there was a grin
on his heavy-jawed face and his bloodshot eyes glinted in
the candle light

  the six candles in the heavy silver candle holder placed
on the desk near where the burly deputy sat furnished the
lighting for the room- then it was wiped into sudden
darkness as burt thrasher moving with surprising speed
for a big man knocked over the candle holder he shot
at the same instant just as shad leaped at him swinging
his gun like a club not daring to shoot for fear of hitting
one of the women or don pablo

  thrasher and the three men with him had been taken
by surprise their guns blazed wildly pecos leaped on
the man holding the candle the barrel of his six-shooter
crashed down on the mans skull

  thrashers my meat shad shouted above the roar of
guns

  he felt the burning sting of thrashers bullet grazing
his ribs then he was on top of the big deputy and they
were crashing over the desk and onto the floor shad
fought to grab the big mans gun which kept blazing al-
most in his face burning powder stung his flesh he
grabbed thrashers gun arm at the wrist twisting jerk-
ing his own gun clubbed the deputys head they rolled
over arid over on the floor crashing into the chair where
don pablo sat tied overturning it it was a fight to the
death

  at the other side of the room young tom wagner
charged the blazing guns of thrashers two men who were
shooting wildly he dove low under the crimson streak
of one gun and when he knocked the man down fell on top
of him a bullet tore toms thigh kicking and clubbing
he kept on fighting

  the third man made a rush for the open doorway where
the dimly lighted corridor showed as he reached the door-
way he made a good target pecos driscoll crouchejl near
the doorway fired once the man stumbled fell rolled
over on his side then lay still

  shad gibson had tackled a tough customer thrasher
out-weighed him fifty pounds and the deputy was all bone
aild beef shad had gone into the room with a gun in each
hand dropped one when he tackled thrasher in the dark
and now thrashers huge hand had grabbed the barrel of
shads gun and was bending and twisting it while shad
kept his grip on the big deputys gun wrist

  the weight and brute strength were thrashers shads
right hand was losing its grip on his gun as thrasher bent
his arm back his hold was slipping on the deputys
thick wrist which yanked and jerked like a horse kicking
in his face he was losing his fight

  burt thrasher rolled on top of shad his two hundred
pounds pinning shad down thrashers head was close to
his the deputys whisky breath was in his face the big
 mans weight was crushing shads ribs shad was losing
his fight to the man who had killed his father

  shad let go his hold on the big deputys wrist let go
his own gun his two free hands grabbed for burt
thrashers throat and found it clamped like fingers of
steel his long legs swung up and around thrashers hips
and held like a vise feet locked together

  a choked cry burst from thrashers throat the big
mans wind was shut off as if by the closing jaws of a steel
trap he fought with a strangling desperate fury the
gun in his hand roared and the bullet struck the tile floor
only a few inches from shads head whining as it rico-
cheted

                                   -arfl-osv-aiiril -
		argosy

  thrashers heaving weight rolled shad from underneath
but he still had his long legs clamped around the big mans
thighs and his two hands had thrashers throat in a death
grip thrashers gun exploded again and the bullet missed
shads head by sheer luck

  burt thrashers breath was coming in whistling gasps
his heavy body was losing its strength he clubbed des-
pers ely at shads head a blow of the gun barrel glanced
off shads cheek and nose and the pain was sickening
shad fought off dizziness and clung to the deputys swell-
ing strangling throat thrashers breath was rattling
now

  the big mans gun barrel kept- striking at shads head
hitting his shoulders banging against the tile floor as
shad fighting from underneath tried to keep the strength
from ebbing out of his hands and arms and legs

  dimly as if he were in some horrible nightmare shad
heard shooting heard a woman screaming heard the
voice of pecos driscoll as if from some far distant place

  shad could not feel any more pounding at his head and
shoulders burt thrashers two-hundred-pound body was
a dead weight on top of him now motionless inert shads
senses reeled in a black nauseating whirl he used every
last shred of strength and will power to keep his legs locked
around the big mans thighs to keep his fingers sunk deep
into the corded swollen flesh of burt thrashers throat

  that was the last that he remembered-that will to hang
on with his hands the way a bulldog grips with its teeth

fhen his senses returned cold water was splashing in
his face somebody was trying to pour whisky down
his throat somebody was telling him to swallow an-
other voice was telling him to break his hold hands were
pulling at his wrists and fingers

  he gritted his teeth and clung harder then his eyes
opened and he blinked into the bright candle light in front
of his face pecos driscoll his face smeared with blood
was grinning at him like some bloody ghastly mask

  let im go shad break your holt you got the big
son choked to death you done killed burt thrasher boy
killed him with your bare hands let go his neck break
away shad boy

  shads fingers let go their death grip his legs lost their
scissors hold somebody rolled that heavy weight off his
chest shad sat up with dizzy painful effort don pablos
lean hands helping him steadying him shad looked into
the black swollen face with its bulging eyes and protrud-
ing tongue and knew that the face belonged to burt
thrasher

  hanged men looked like that shad had seen a hanged
man once when he was a boy he shad gibson had done
that with his hands to the man who had killed his father

  pecos driscoll covered the dead mans face with a faded
blue denim brush-jacket he had found in the room the
jacket had a bullet hole in the middle of the back black
bob huntoons brush-jacket

  wheres tom wagner shad found his voice

  rosita and the dona are helping the padre dress his
wounds said don pablo drink this my young amigo
it is twenty-year-old whisky

  it occurred to shad that there was no longer any shooting
outside or in the corridor pecos answered the question in
his eyes

  we got em as they come chargin into the house
young tom and don pablo and me it was like ketchin
fish when theyre bitin good them gringo sons come
a-chargin in to kill and plunder they run slap-dab into
a hornets nest

  don pablo had got loose from the chair he was tied
to and grabbed a gun young tom fought like a wildcat

he stopped three-four bullets thatll slow him down for
a few weeks but hell live that padre is the best doctor
in the country and from the way it looked when they
carried him into her bedroom the senorita rosita is the
only nurse that wild young cowhand will be needin

  pecos adjusted the bandage that had slipped from his
bullet-torn cheek grinned widely as don pablo handed
him a filled glass

  senorssaid don pablo compadfes you have saved
my life and the life of my good senora and you have
saved my daughter we are forever in your debt salud

t ater when the padre had dressed shads bruised
-j shoulders and head and the bullet rip along his ribs
when they had sat with the wounded- tom wagner until
he dropped off to sleep holding tightly to rosita vidals
hand shad and pecos and don pablo went into the office
which had been cleaned and scrubbed of the last bloody
traces of the battle and don pablo handed shad the filled
money belt

  the money belongs to tom wagner and his sister
you will return it to her and now if you care to listen i
will tell you what i know concerning the murder of bill
gibson and pete wagner

  thats the main reason why pat connity sent us down
here said pecos driscoll he figgered that somehow
wed git to the bottom of the whole thing

  black boj huntoon is dead said don pablo burt
thrasher is likewise dead those are the two men who
did the actual killing from what i have gathered from time
to time from their drunken boasting

  but the man who planned it was miles huntoon i
give you my word senors i had nothing to do with the
murder of those two men until a month or so ago i had
believed their deaths to be accidental then the actions
of miles huntoon caused me to be suspicious

  miles huntoon paid us frequent visits he came to
pay court to my daughter rosita but in order to win my
approval of his courtship miles huntoon offered me a
proposition	 

  he told me that he would one day own both the gib-
son and the wagner ranches then he said the gibson
fence would be opened he and i would join the two big
ranches that would take in all the range on both sides of
the border

  there would no longer be any necessity for my
vaqueros to steal cattle from my mexican enemies whose
ranches join my san luis grant the man knew of my
great ambitions he knew i would go to any lengths to get
what i wanted he knew of my desire to marry my
daughter to a man of wealth and power

  he is a man who is not unattractive to women rosita
has something of my love for power and wealth not
until an hour or so ago when she thought young tom
wagner was dying did she ever show an honest and real
love for any man

  now you see me a defeated man i stand before you
humbled and sincere and willing to do my share in repair-
ing any wrong i have caused rosita has found the man-
she loves i am content to give up the san luis grant

i	have enough money put away to last me and my wife i
am content to live somewhere in a modest manner the rest
of my days the prayers of the good dona have been
answered

  if you hope to catch miles huntoon you had better
work fast news travels swiftly when he hears of burt
thrashers defeat here he might lose his nerve and quit
the country though perhaps not he is a shrewd and
ruthless man

 burt thrasher was not lying when he said that miles

                                -argosy-april -
wet beef from mexico



huntoon has dug up old documents that will hold in a
court of law and give him the san luis grant including
the gibson ranch and the wagner campo ranch i have
an old map that so defines the borders of the san luis
grant and it will be hard to prove a charge of murder
against a man as clever as miles huntoon

  that said shad grimly is a little matter that we
wont be callin on the law to settle thrasher and bob
huntoon are dead miles huntoon is th next man on
the list cartridges are surer and cheaper than lawsuits
and provin a murder charge against a man like miles
huntoon ive got a cartridge with his name on it so has
pecos and i reckon its time we hit the trail for the cow
town of campo eh pecos

chapter viii

brave flag of ireland

tt was sunrise when shad gibson and pecos driscoll
bandaged weary-eyed grim-lipped rode up to miles
huntoons house at the edge of campo they swung from
their saddles and while pecos watched the rear of the
adobe house where the judge lived with a mexican house-
keeper shad pounded loudly on the front door

  nobody answered his pounding and he made ready to
smash in the door but the door was not locked a turn
of the handle opened it he went in with his gun in his
hand and pecos entered by the rear door which was like-
wise unlocked they met in the hallway a quick search
of the house showed that it was empty they looked at
one another chagrin and bitter disappointment in their
eyes

  looks like miles huntoon got some bad news and
quit the country said shad hes got away on us

  but his bed was made his clothes hung up in his
closet his whole house in order there was no indication
of anything like a hurried departure

  well try his office he might be there

  they rode down the main street to his office which was
a modest adobe building on campos main and only street
on the door was tacked a notice closed indefinitely
they peered through the uncurtained window the
office was empty there was no use in searching further
for their man pecos said that perhaps pat connity might
know something of miles huntoons disappearance but
there was little hope in their hearts as they rode on down
the street headed for patrick henry connitys place at
the other end of town v  

  they told themselves that miles huntoon had gotten
word of the fight at the vidal ranch and had quit campo
for parts unknown pulled out in the night when the
sleepy little cow town of campo awoke and started about
its daily business the citizens mostly mexicans would find
that notice tacked to the door of the office of judge miles
huntoon justice of the peace it was a bitter dose for
shad gibson and pecos driscoll to swallow after a nights
hard and weary ride

  before they sighted pat connitys house which was off
the main street and hidden from sight by mesquite and
palos verdes trees shad and pecos heard sounds that
caused them to sit erect in their saddles and look at one
another in puzzled bewilderment strange sounds were
shattering the peaceful silence of the desert sunrise

  shouting the barking of dogs the beating of a drum
the unmistakable voice of patrick henry connity lifted
in song singing the wearing oj the green smaller
shriller voices taking up the tune and the words

  then they reined up staring the irish flag with its
golden harp on a green background fluttered from the

top of a high flagpole in front of pat connitys house and
around the flagpole marched as strange a procession as the
two men had ever seen

   patrick henry connity in a clean white suit wearing a
 green tie and a large shamrock in his coat lapel led the
 procession behind him marched the half dozen small
 murillos wearing caps made of bright green paper aurelio
 the oldest of the boys was pounding a drum the wire-
 haired dog obanion a large green ribbon tied in a bow
 knot around his neck barked and charged about scattering
 stray chickens

   pecos shads voice lost something of its bitter dis-
 appointment what day of the month is it
 somewheres around the sixteenth-seventeenth of
 march

   saint patricks day said shad grinning saint
 patricks day in the mornin

 ne of the small murillos was the first to sight the two
 riders he shouted something in a shrill excited voice
 the procession halted piling up in confusion the drum
 whammed a final boom and went silent pat connitys song
 broke off in the middle he shouted loudly at the open
 door of his adobe house
 s rita carlos mamacita murillo its shad gibson
 and pecos driscoll back from the san luis ranch and
 they look like theyre just returned from the wars 

   rita wagner came running out she was wearing a
 green-dress and a green ribbon in her hair carlos murillo
 following had a shamrock pinned to a pinkish silk shirt
 the buxom senora murillo wore a green sash around her
 ample waist

   rita wagner gave a little sob as shad swung from his
 saddle and took her in his arms

   tom she whispered whats happened to tom

   a whole lot shad grinned down at her fear stricken
 face and all of it good news toms all right he was
 never in better shape in his life

   god and saint patrick be praised for that bit of fine
 news on this saint patricks day in the mornin said pat
 connity then he turned to the six small murillos a wide
 grin on his red face

  they stood there in their green paper hats dressed in
 their sunday clothes scrubbed until their brown skins
 shone huddling together in wide-eyed awe at the two
 bandaged cowpunchers

   aurelio pancho jaoquin pasqual margarita lupe
 he called the roll of the small murillos tell shad gibson
 and pecos driscoll the great news all together now one
 two three go

   queen isabella    has   six    pups born on
 saint patricks day in the mornin  

   the chorus started weakly timidly gained strength and
 confidence ended in shrill shouting while obanion ran
 in circles barking and the murillo dog queen isabella
 a lady dog of mixed parentage that favored bird-dog
 ancestry appeared in the cabin doorway tail wagging
 as if taking her cue to accept proper and fitting applause

   carlos murillo pointed to queen isabella and laughed
 his wife beamed obanion cavorted and barked and
 licked queen isabellas face then queen isabella also
 decorated with a green ribbon went back into the house
 where she had left her six newly born puppies

   rita and i sat up all night with her said pat connity
 the first puppy came at a quarter past midnight and
 now its a bit of a drink well be havin while aurelio and
 panchito jaquin and pasqual put up your horses

   and you can be tellin us how you come to be bandaged
 like a couple of mummies and its good irish whisky

argosy

throats come inside now the both of ye if ever two
men looked like they had need of a nip-

   well take a drink ill tell a man said pecos then
well saddle two fresh horses and hit the trail were
after miles huntoon and we aint stoppin till we cut
his sign

   yell be needin no fresh horses then unless it is that
from here to the jail is too far for a couple of cowpunchers
to walk the bright blue eyes of patrick henry connity
twinkled

   jail blurted shad gibson

 a nd ive got the key in me pocket and miles hun-
toon locked like a fine feathered rooster in a coop
with his tail feathers pulled thanks to my good friends
carlos murillo and dwight smith and their bright legal
minds and the sharp teeth av the obanion and the two
fists av patrick henry connity pat connity blew gently
on bruised and swollen knuckles and did a jig step then
bowing elaborately to rita wagner

   aye and to the courage av the fairest colleen in any
land to rita wagner goes the credit for faith and cour-
age and that rare gift in a woman the ability to keep a
silent tongue in her head he beamed at shad and pecos

   that curly wolf baitefd his own trap with as clever
a bit av shenanigans and forgery as ever was perpetrated
never countin on the legal minds of such men as dwight
smith who knows the last bit of land law in the west and
carlos murillo who is the grand master of mexican law
and the transfer of titles of old spanish grants miles
huntoon did bait his own trap

   the charge against him is grand theft and forgery of
legal documents theres the graver charge of murder
that im hopin to prove against judge miles huntoon
the dirty scut

   shad gibson took a stained little red-backed tally book
from his pocket and handed it to pat connity

   this belonged to black bob huntoon rosita vidal
managed to get hold of it once before it was stained by
water in bob huntoons handwritin somewhere in this
tally book is evidence that will prove that miles huntoon
hired him and burt thrasher to kill bill gibson and pete
wagner

   black bob put it in writin and miles huntoons name
is signed to it and its witnessed by burt thrasher black
bob was holdin it as a weapon against his brother miles
in case miles tried to double-cross him none of those
thieves trusted one another

   pat connity nodded miles huntoon knows now that
burt thrasher killed black bob huntoon one of thra-
shers men sold that big deputy out to judge huntoon
miles huntoon planned to kill burt thrasher for that
murder of his brother after the law had sent shadrock here
to yuma prison

   burt thrashers killin was to be passed off as the re-
sult of somethin else and the killin would be made to look
like self-defense the man who sold burt thrasher out
to miles huntoon sold miles huntoon out to patrick
henry connity for more easy money there is no honor
as the sayin goes among thieves

   and now pat connity smiled well drink the health
av the obanion who bit a hunk out av the leg av miles
huntoon while i was swingin me fists later well pay
miles huntoon a bit av a visit at the calaboose to the
obanion and queen isabella

the morning hours were taken up with the festivities of
saint patricks day the men drank irish whisky
rita and senora murillo sipped lemonade colored red

with berry juice for the small murillos dwight smith
joined them for the banquet prepared by the senora
murillo and served by rita wagner

   pecos told the story of the battle at the vidal ranch
 because of the women and wide-eyed little murillos he
 passed over the killing of burt thrasher with the simple
 statement that shad gibson had done the job

   patrick henry connity dapper little dwight smith
 announced in a crisply worded speech will be sworn in
 as the new justice of the peace here at campo i know of
 no man better fitted for that honor

   dwight smiths speech called for much cheering an-
 other drink more pink lemonade for the almost-bursting
 small murillos

   the banquet over pat connity took shad gibson and
 pecos driscoll over to the jail

   give me the jail key pat shad had suggested earlier
 in the day pecos will loan me his six-shooter to give to
 miles huntoon ill give him a fightin even chance for
 his life

   that job pecos had protested solidly belongs to
 me son

   the law decided pat connity with a finality that
 forbade further argument will hang miles huntoon

   he repeated it now as he unlocked the outer door and
 led the way into the gray shadowed jail

   at the barred door of miles huntoons cell they halted
 suddenly the perfectly tailored body of judge miles
 huntoon hung by a short length of rope tied to the ridge
 log and looped around miles huntoons neck the man
 had stood on a chair to adjust the rope for his hanging
 then had kicked away the chair

   a signed confession had been written out and left on
 the bunk pat connity spoke in a hushed tone

   get on back to the house shadrock petfos and i will
 attend to things here last night when i took the man
 his supper he asked for pen and ink and paper and a
 ten-foot length of rope it was not for me to refuse a
 prisoner a simple request nor was it for me to ask ques-
 tions call it cowardice or courage it is not for us to
 judge amen

   shadrock gibson walked a little unsteadily out of the
 gray shadow of the adobe jail and out into the bright
 march sunshine rita wagner was waiting for him at
 pat connitys house

   there were plans to make the uniting of the three
 ranches that straddled the border the tearing down of
 the ten-wire border fence for which there would be no
 further need

   don pablo would still own the mexican half of the san
 luis grant shad gibson and the wagners would be
 running the half-circle g and campo ranches there
 would also be the annexing of the walking h and the
 drag t outfits shad had a filled money belt to give to
 rita and they would be leaving soon shad and rita
 for the vidal ranch where the padre would perform a
 double marriage

   there would be a great fiesta there at theold san
 luis rancho pecos pat connity dwight smith the
 entire murillo family would attend the wedding fiesta
 the opening of the fence that would unite the arizona and
 mexican halves of the old spanish san luis grant would
 be a ceremony attended by border patrol officials

   it was good to walk in the bright sunshine of saint
 patricks day shad saluted the irish flag that moved
 limply in the breeze rita wagner obanion at her heels
 walked toward him

sbs readers viewpoint

 a s you know we have a half a
 dozen analysts among our readers
 who grade the fiction and determine
 our average by the month or year one
 of them is with us this week a gentle-
 man who sends in an annual report

  he doesnt seem to think anyone no-
 tices his ratings now we do as weve
 said more than once we find these
 scorecards not only interesting but
 helpful moreover our guess is that
 most readers enjoy seeing estimates of
 stories theyve read for one thing
 these ratings give them the opportunity
 to disagree and that is a thoroughly
 normal american jndoor sport

      although i am a bit late with this
    my fifth annual report on the state and
    condition of argosy i am sure that
    since nobody would have missed it in
    the first place and in the second place
    nobody wants it i will be pardoned

      has after a slow start shown
  argosy to be a much improved maga-
  zine toward the close i believe a
  number of the old and much-liked
  authors have been reappearing between
  its covers and some of the younger
  displayed excellent ability

     the find of the year as far as iam
  concerned is a short-story writer by the
  name of robert arthur how about a

                      ever attempted even the least bit
                      of training under competent guidance

                               or have you been sitting back as it
                             is so easy to do waiting for the day
                             to come when you will waken all of

                           come before the chicken

                             it is seldom that anyone becomes a
 writer until he or she has been
 writing for some time that is why so many authors and writers
 spring up out of the newspaper business the day-to-day necessity
 of writing-of gathering material about which to write-develops
 their talent their insight their background and their confidence as
 nothing else could	

   that is why the newspaper institute of america bases its writing
 instruction on journalism-continuous writing-the training that
 has produced so many successful authors

learn to write by writing

 newspaper institute training is based on the new york copy
 desk method it starts and keeps you writing in your own home
 on your own time week by week you receive actual assignments
 just as if you were right at work oji a great metropolitan daily

  you will find that instead of vainly trying to copy someone elses
  writing tricks you are rapidly developing your own distinctive self-
  flavored style-undergoing an experience that has a thrill to it and
  which at the same time develops in you the power to make your feel-
  ings articulate

  many people who should be writing become awe-
  struck by fabulous stories about millionaire authors
  and therefore give little thought to the   and
   or more that can often be earned for material
  that takes little time to write-stories articles on
  business fads travels sports recipes etc-things

parjeeville wis

you are now well acquainted
with the improved argosy
which offers you a large clear type
and sixteen additional pages we
feel confident that the changes we
have made will be heartily ap-
proved by our readers and we have
definite reason for our confidence

  as soon as we announced the
change to larger type and the in-
crease in size letters began to pour
into this office we received
thousands of them many from
readers who had already expressed
disapproval of the small type that
was our first experiment fine they
said in unison give us a larger type
and more pages and we are with
you

  there were so many of these
letters that we cannot possibly pub-
lish them all but here are a few
excerpts i notice in your march 
issue an announcement that you are
going to print a larger type i hope
therefore that i will again enjoy
reading your magazine  your
statement announcing the use of
larger type changes my mind and
as  like all your writers i shall
continue to read argosy  i
venture to say that the majority of
your old readers would be in favor
of the old type

   clearly we have now solved the
difficult problem of argosys for-
mat but the solution would never
have been reached if we had not
received the aid of thousands of
readers they showed us the way
and for their loyalty and keen
judgment we are deeply grateful
