the happiest day of my life

our wedding day a year ago it seemed
like a dream that would never come true
for my salary then was barely enough for
one to live on i faced the facts unless i
could make more money i had no right to
keep ruth waiting i must find out how
to make myself worth more

  it was ruth herself who showed me
the way she clipped a coupon out of a
magazine and we sent it to the international
correspondence schools for information
about their courses within a week i had
enrolled the training i got from studying
at home showed up almost at once in
my office work they gave me more re-
sponsibilities inside of six months i was

promoted with a substantial raise now im
getting double what i was a year ago-
and were married

  employers everywhere are on the watch
for men who want to get ahead and are
willing to prove it by training themselves
to do some one thing well i c s courses
have given thousands the special knowledge
they need to win better jobs and bigger pay
why not you

  one hour of spare time a day spent in
i c s study will prepare you for the posi-
tion you want in the work you like best
find out how it wont obligate you in the
least to ask for full particulars do it now

the brand of

the dancer in the shadow

 by mary frances doner

  the music stole through the dimness
of the studio and there came the danc-
ing figure of ursula royle the daughter
of a proud old family who could snatch
away mens senses by the sheer magic
of her art they called her dance the
moth and the flame and to her flame
there came the moth glenn mortimer
one of her own people aristocratic so-
phisticated madly in love with the beau-
tiful girl

  but there was still another moth
whose wings had carried him into an
atmosphere far different from that
which surrounded ursula and glenn
this was andrew cameron the vaude-
ville singer he too loved ursula and
for his sake she left the luxuries of her
washington square home to take up
with andrew the fantastic life of the
road

  and then there came into their lives
adventure that carries the reader along
in breathless pace to the thrilling climax

  the dancer in the shadow is a
story of new york of not so long ago
and of love and of high romance with
a quality about it which is indeed dis-
tinguished

internal baths end
years of bad health

brooklyn man says he feels like

a new man now

i almost feel like shouting the news from
the housetop it is absolutely amazing to
think that so simple a thing as internal
baths could produce such marvelous re-
sults   you couldnt get me to stop tak-
ing internal baths for  now that ive
found how wonderful they keep me feeling
leopold aul

r

                    by leopold aul

imagine what a thrilling thing it is when a
man who has been sinking deeper and deeper
into the quicksands of ill health-finds himself sud-
denly restored to happiness vitality and vigor as if
by an act of providence

  imagine how a man feels when he realizes that
at last he can say goodbye to headaches bilious-
ness and mental sluggishness that have been sap-
ping his energy for years

  even now it seems too wonderful to be true
and yet the whole thing came about through a
lucky accident-this marvelous experience that
changed me from a failing half-alive victim of self-
poisoning into one of the healthiest-looking humans
you ever saw

  it happened this -way one day when i was feel-
ing especially bad-with a wretched headache and
nervous as a cat-i met an old friend of mine he
noticed how fagged out i looked and how rapidly i
was aging

  why dont you take internal baths he sug-
gested they did wonders for me youre prob-
ably suffering from intestinal poisoning and dont
realize it

 what is an internal bath

 what is an internal bath i asked some sort
of an enema not at all he replied it is
entirely different from anything else

   yorur colon large intestine is just like any other
waste pipe while it apparently keeps functioning all

right the inner walls
gradually become
caked with deposit
just like a rusty wa-
ter pipe germs and
slow poisons breed in
this hardened waste
matter and filter
right into the blood
stream causing all
kinds of symptoms
that you might
never dream of trac-
ing to your colon

  even certain eye troubles and loss of hair are
often aggravated this way-to say nothing of head-
aches constipation fatigue and dozens of other
aches and ills

how it works

  internal baths bring results so quickly that
most people are astonished by means of the
j b l cascade five quarts of pure warm water
treated with a marvelous cleansing tonic-are sent
gently whirling through the entire length of the
five foot colon i poisons headachy and nerve-
upsetting waste matter are completely washed
off and floated free

  fifteen minutes later your colon is thoroughly
clean a new feeling of vigor and well-being
sweeps over you your head is clearer-your brain
keener-your entire outlook on life is changed   
try it-and see for yourself

  naturally i lost no time in securing my j b l
cascade it was a turning point in my life simple
as the whole thing was it actually made a new man

out of me at night i sleep like a child i rise in the
morning bubbling over with pep and energy
only regret is that i did not learn of j b l inter-

my

cross section of an iron
pipe almost choked with
rust deposits the human
colon large intestine is
subject to the same kind
of clogging

morning bubbling over
only regret is that i
nal baths long ago

the lonely heart

by mary frances doner

   rose stood in the chill dusk with
 brilliant early stars rocking in the windy
 heavens waiting

   in this fashion begins a story which
 has in it all the elements that make for
 the best of good reading-suspense ro-
 mance intrigue adventure for rose
 was waiting to see david marsh pass
 by-david whose coming to the little
 town had caused such a fluttering of the
 local dovecotes to rose it seemed as
 if a star had fallen dcwn into the dark-
 ness of her lonely heart afid david were
 that particularly bright star

    here is no usual story of the city man
 and the small-town girl though heaven
 knows that the midwest town where
 rose lived and whither david had come
 from sophisticated harvard was small
 indeed as a matter of fact there is
 nothing of the usual in the entire un-
 folding of the tragedy of a lonely heart
 which the author so deftly portrays it
 is a strangely moving deeply felt ten-
 der love story that brings quick tears to
 the eyes of the most hardened reader
 and yet at the end there is the sort of
 true happiness that comes only after
 suffering

blondys boy friend

by leatrice homesley

a dizzy blonde it was this flip
epithet which irene applied to herself

   but a lot went on beneath her golden
 hair that escaped the notice of the casual
 passer-by and when the real test came
 with irenes awakening to love she rose
 to a tremendous crisis in magnificent
 fashion

   irene finds herself in a strange out-
 of-the-way estate in connecticut sur-
 rounded by a sinister group of men and
 women these have a common object
 of hate in the shape of an overbearing
 englishman who on r night of storm
 is found dead in his bed murdered
 and any one of seven or eight might
 have done the deed swiftly the sus-
 picion fastens upon the man who has
 found the way to irenes real self and
 as swiftly irene undertakes the desper-
 ate task of tracking down the culprit
 the complications pile up the story
 gathers pace and momentum until at
 length you come to the astonishing cli-
 max and reluctantly set down the book
 convinced that here you have come upon
 that rarest of combinations a real love
 story and a stirring- mystery yarn

we ve discovered a good stunt

     other people have discovered it
too but that doesnt matter maybe
you havent things looked black the
other day you know-weather bills
and so on this problem and that prob-
lem-just like yours thinking about
everything brought about a sort of men-
tal confusion and so we sat down and
wore out a sort of ledger page the
problems stated on one side and all the
possible solutions on the other youd
be surprised how it clears the air for
you

	  

jhen we got to thinking that there
ought to be another column on a
more general scale and so we wrote
down a lot of things about life of which
we disapproved and on the other side a
lot of things we liked that cleared the
air too what is more it cheered us up
remarkably

  we found that the like column grew
longer than its mate starting out with
liking various people kinds of food
sleep different sports certain stories
periodicals places seasons animals and
so on we began putting down other
things less tangible but you may be
sure just as valuable

jt was peculiarly novel and pleasant
to write down that we like twilight
better than any other time of the day
that we like the feel of a paddle the
look of a book the october sky moun-
tain cabins fireplaces the moon when
its large and orange colored the smell
of a country schoolroom the tang of
salt air sand dunes the strains of a
string quartet the sizzle of bacon music
on the water camping alone cheery win-
dows lighted at night the first puff from
a pipe railroad stations peep frogs and
crickets at nightfall and white church
spires

     		if

jf you get going on the things you
like you cant stop you dont even
want to stop we like the sound of
presses the smell of printers ink the
hum of traffic on fifth avenue coun-
try brooks and pine trees skyscrapers
and ferryboats cellos flutes and vio-
lins atlases and geography books coffee
and chessboards apple pie a la mode
and the click of a typewriter

  other people may not get any special
enjoyment out of these things-may not
even be able to see why we like them
its hard to explain thats half the
fun of writing them down try it

chapter i

stepsons of spain

the shrill blast of a bugle re-
sounded down the blazing moroc-
can air the regimental call of the
spanish foreign legion to assembly
hundreds of legionarios shuffling
through the sand hurried to quarters
among the ranks of their comrades

  though the august sun had barely
nudged over the horizon the thermom-
eter was already above a hundred ten
degrees-such was the heat of rio de
oro from between the tent flaps
drooping lifelessly in the silent air
hastened many spanish officers one
and all these men stared anxiously into
the east-an endless march of dunes

a gold-brown dust cloud was moving

along the far horizon the trumpeter
from his tower had been the first to see
and report it slowly atfirst then more
rapidly dark objects bobbed through
the moving cloud the desert hordes of
djicheur moor and bedouin were com-
ing in to rio de oro for summer con-
ference it was the fifteenth day of
august the day when all the roving
bands of the great desert under the
leadership of el corsario the vandal
assembled with the officers of old
spain on that day of days did they
decide on the mutual ruling of those un-
tamed moroccan lands

  it meant peace of a kind or war
before the sun would set in scarlet and
blood across the high atlas mountains
if peace it represented a generous
chantage from the rich coffers of spain

the legion
of manana

guns burros and stout hearts-that is spains
legion of tomorrow

but peace in morocco my friends is
a misleading word a misnomer as we
recognize the word there is no such
condition in any part of morocco-for
long peace with the djicheur means
to spain that he shall reduce his num-
ber of raids from let us generously
say ten raids a month down to four
and with the express promise that he
shall not make war on nor take into
custody babies children women and
theoretically civilian men

  some of the better stamp of kaids
sheikhs and cherifs keep their promises

  it was with a wild thunder of hoof-
beats and flying sand that the gallop-
ing bands of desert tribes swept into
the legion outpost of ait ahmed at
their head on a coal-black stallion rode
the massive figure of el corsario the

vandal as he had become known to the
legion without visible weapons he
led his men his flowing djeelaba of
glistening blue silk rippled out over the
steaming flanks of his beautiful mount
immediately behind him in scarlet
robes followed his kaids sheikhs
cherifs and under-chieftains thrust
high over their heads they waved their
flashing scimitars while close upon
their heels the thundering hordes of
desert mongrels followed firing their
muskets in savage salutation as they en-
tered the legion outpost

  presentan las armas shouted the
sargento to his men as el corsario and
his officers passed in galloping review
before them

  as one man those long rows of mus-
kets jerked to present arms the desert


the popular magazine

leaders momentarily steadied their
scimitars above their heads in a wild
brandishing acknowledgment

  heart of a scorpion hissed the ser-
geant to his legionarios he doesnt
rate a salute

  the men in silence held their jaws
grimly one didnt speak to a sargento
in the legion frequently even when
spoken to such was the discipline with
savage screams and maniacal shouts the
desert tribesmen clattered on into the
legion square there el corsario
swung from his horse met by a dozen
spanish officers and aid-de-camps he
and his desert chiefs were ushered into
a massive tent over which rippled the
crimson-and-gold banner of old spain
while the legion band boomed out
la marcha real

  richard kent an american serving
in the legion espanol stood beside the
conference table of his comandante
tensely he waited with his brother offi-
cers of the legion this chief of the
djicheurs was he crazy plumb loco

  i tell you its extortion blazed
comandante cordoba fiercely

  the face of el corsario was immo-
bile and of the tint of marble

  and i answered the desert chief-
tain resentfully can only repeat to
you once more and for tbe last time
ray terms for peace with spain in rio
de oro twenty thousand duros five
hundred camels and fifty of my young
cherifs to be allowed to take military
training in machine gunnery and small
cannon for six months at your mejjat
post

  the words fell like hammer blows
against steel in that strained quiet of
the headquarters tent outside a grow-
ing breeze was flinging the sand swish-
ingly against the canvas and dusting it
across the floor boards for a few taut
seconds the legion commander stared
analytically incredulously at the great
djicheur leader there was returned
no leniency no retracting from those

beady black eyes that burned beneath
that tightly wound blue turban of the
djicheur the comandante was a man
of few words he recognized unfair
barter from fair

  then you make a treaty with
death he flared

  the sharp eyes of el corsario nar-
rowed to tiny slits of flame hatred
radiated from his bronzed moslem face
his hands clenched suddenly

  and you witty one he barked sav-
agely have slapped death in the
mouth my silent ones will answer
you that insult

  the comandante leaped to his feet
hotly

  bastante out of my sight you in-
fection of a jackal your silent ones
-your treacherous ones-will keep
watch with the dead look to your
bloody scimitars red steel and machine
guns you understand very well
you shall have them

  el corsario hunched his spacious
djeelaba over his right shoulder with a
deliberative angry gesture and spun on
his heel toward the tent opening at
the flaps he hesitated faced about
menacingly a bestial scowl on his face

  perhaps mi amigo taunted the big
djicheur sarcastically it will interest
you to know that there are two caravans
at the moment en route from the ruby
mines at targa el mayat to your post
they must pass through my desert trails
-if they can with a wide bowing
leer the desert warrior bent low to
the legion commander in mock cour-
tesy

  the comandante although his face
blanched as pale as milk and his body
tensed rigid also bent low in grand
answering gesture

  they will pass your lines corsario
he boomed fierily

  in loud shufflings the group of kaids
sheikhs and cherifs drew their long
sweeping djeelabas around them and
pushed through the tent flaps to tbe
the legion of manana

outer air with grim silence the
djicheur leaders climbed to their wait-
ing horses in a moment el corsario was
leading his wild packs back toward the
heat-wavering sand dunes that stretched
eastward into infinity eight of the
young cherifs riding behind their leader
held their scimitars pointed toward the
earth and his satanic majesty-the sym-
bolizing signal to the tribesmen that
their truce had not been accepted and
that war was to follow

  without yelling but in foreboding
thunder the hundreds of horsemen rode
off into that fated august day their
hoofbeats roaring out a wild tattoo
against the sultry morning air the
legionarios did not return their glinting
blue carbines to present arms there
was a peculiar feeling of tenseness in
the atmosphere as the sun blazoned
along those hundreds of legion rifle
barrels

  as the great rolling sand cloud settled
and melted to view across the trackless
sea of desert the sharp peal of the snare
drums and the shrill chant of the fifers
called the legionarios to quarters to pre-
pare for the red carnage that every sol-
dier knew would follow within the
headquarters tent comandante cordoba
stared with anxious furrowed brow
from one to the other of his legion
officers

  corsario he blazed vengefully
carrion thats what he should be
named he who makes war on women
and children two caravans eh he
murmured the last thoughtfully his
eyes gazing out the tent flaps and on
into the heat-riven sahara

  had el corsario been bluffing or
were there really two caravans putting
out from targa el mayat somehow
there was conviction in the demeanor of
the desert vandal cordoba turned to
lieutenant kent an officer on whom he
had learned he could depend an officer
with nearly five years of legion ex-
perience who not only understood the



arabic language like a djicheur but
also the mental workings of those r
shrewd jackallike tribesmen

   listen mi teniente inquired the
legion commander didnt we have
some sort of a communication last
month from our tombeaux base that
two caravans were about to put out
from targa el mayat

  yes sir we did they were to
have left the twentieth of july the
operators of the american ruby mines
with their families traveling to the
coast

  valgame dios groaned cordoba
then el corsario is right theyve
started late viciously he jabbed his
thumbs under his sam browne belt
this looks bad bad he roved his
eyes over his officers analytically
listen my men the civilians of the
region look to us of the legion for
protection we must not fail them
weve got to get forces to toum agoug
at once the caravans will likely reach
that settlement before el corsario and
his wild hyenas can intercept them

   he flung about to kent

  these desert voyagers are your
countrymenr you know well the toum
agoug sector im going to designate
your company the searching party to
skirmish for them take radio and
keep in touch with headquarters troop so
we can give you protection should you
need it your job will be to locate these
two caravans-and to bring them safely
in-while the legion pummels cor-
sario and his bloody gypsies

   kents jaws snapped to with a sharp
click he drew his six feet two of ari-
zona fighting brawn to attention the
wild lights of battle gleamed from his
steel-gray eyes

   sisehor as you wish it

  wait commanded cordoba
better take two companies those
caravans from the mines nearly always
transport jewels corsario knows this
he will send a hundred men at least


the popular magazine

  to reconnoiter for them any prefer-
 ences 

    yes give me teniente rivas and
  his outfit we understand each other
  rivas it is you in charge start
  at once circle south of isbouia to the
  main caravan trails when you inter-
  cept the civil party bring them under
  our protection at the old parapets in
  toum agoug because you will soon be
  outnumbered by corsario pronto
  the comandante thrust a bronzed
  palm toward kent

     buena suerte

     good luck to you also sir an-
  swered kent earnestly

     on the barracks square kent strode
  toward the khaki lines of his own com-
  pany drawn up waiting for him a
  raucous series of growls and curses
  issued from the ranks fists were flail-
  ing over a huddled form on the parade
  ground kent stared angrily hadnt
  they enough trouble in the air without
  rioting from within the company hot
  blood leaped to his brain a rough
  voice rose from the churning fisticuffs

     a ionano complaining of the heat
   ho a stormy laugh that one

    it was butchy his russian ser-
  geant a cruel heartless soldier he
  drove his toe into the sides of anderson
  a tall englishman

   get up nameless one he spat
  youre not sick

    kent in two strides reached the
  group he had seen too much of
  butchys brutality of late it would
  have to be brought to a stop roughly
  he grabbed his noncom by the shoulder
  and flung him backward though disci-
  plining a noncommissioned officer be-
  fore his men was the one thing that
  kent heartily detested usually it was
  bad for morale

     basta he barked in spanish the
  language of the legion strike one
  of my men again and ill give you fifteen
  days in the prison camps

    butchys face turned first white

with amazed anger then flushed scarlet
with a growing hatred for his company
officer

  the good samaritan eh he
growled venomously the big big
big yanqui with the big big heart eh
i was only disciplining this nameless
dog in the french foreign legion

  shut up butchy snapped kent
before i lose my temper thats
where you ought to be now-back in
the french legion on a sou a day
youre running wild with decent treat-
ment here

  he pushed the sergeant to one side
and bent over the prostrate form of
the englishman his eyes bloodshot and
glassy cheeks white

  heat eh brain fever a rising
dislike for his sergeant boiled within
kent take him--

  there came a wild scuffling behind
kent two figures toppled heavily
across his back he was forced to his
knees with the impact a bayonet fell
with a dull thud in the soft sands be-
side him kent lunged to his feet toss-
ing the legionarios from his back
salazar his spanish corporal was
struggling with the sergeant a mum-
ble of mad voices rippled down the
ranks

   silencio shouted kent

  el sargento-he tried to knife you
senor-i-

   its a lie snapped butchy

   wild growls of denial from the ranks
kent picked up the fallen bayonet and
returned it to butchy then he turned
to salazar quietly and firmly he com-
manded 

  take charge of the company sala-
zar youll get your sergeants stripes
later

  as for you you yellow-bellied

jackal- he flared at butchy

from now on youre a private ill
take care of your case when we get
back ive no time for the likes of you
the legion of manana



now we need every man behind a
bayonet and-we march

  ill kill you - you- ground

butchy under his breath

  not if you live to be a thousand
laughed kent mirthlessly i could
shoot you and justifiably but forget it
keep your bayonet for the djicheur
youll need it and put your mind toward
redeeming yourself

  wide of eyes the legionarios stared
name of a name the sergeant had
insulted an officer of the legion before
his men he had assaulted him then
he had threatened his life that was a
day to remember what patience these
americanos possessed a german or
a frenchman would have shot the dog
on the spot kent ordered the sick
man removed to the hospital then he
turned to salazar his newly made ser-
geant

  equip the company for five days
march full packs for every man ra-
tions and ammunition twenty ma-
chine guns and four field pieces
double canteens of water and the water
lorry he hesitated a moment if
theres any time left before i return
drop the men to their stomachs for
five minutes rest we march thirty
kilometers toward toum agoug before
the stars set to-night the seventh
company goes with us theres plenty
trouble ahead vaya

  si senor

  teniente richard kent then hustled
off to requisition his own personal
marching equipment his radio desert
compass flashlight pistol and ammuni-
tion saber and emergency pack

chapter ii

the djicheur

vi hen the stars gleamed through
the clear african skies that night
two companies of marching feet re-
sounded against the gaunt canyon walls
of the atlas mountains thirty kilo-

meters they had marched that day the
shrill chant of the fifers and the rumble
of the snare drummers driving them
forward to those black shadows of the
desolate ranges that blotted out the
stars ahead

  off beyond and below that range
on the morrow would stretch more blaz-
ing sun and glaring sand-sand and
sun sun and sand that was legion life
-and somewhere across its lonely
wastes lay in hiding el corsario and
his desert jackals questing the blood of
innocents the little spanish borricos
or donkeys their long shaggy ears
flopping wearily shuffled dazedly beside
the marching ranks of the soldiers
their heavy packs of canteens rations
ammunition and machine guns crunch-
ing and squeaking on their leather
thongs

  the fifers and drummers ceased their
driving tunes they had reached the
land of the enemy silence was im-
perative toward the peak of a hill
some six hundred feet in height the
legionarios climbed the stony slopes

  kent and rivas their sabers clank-
ing their  holsters slapping their
thighs picked the trail for their faith-
fuls behind them rivas pointed down
the desolate valley a few lights from
a tiny moorish ksar or settlement
blinked sleepily starward

  the lights of toum agoug

  yes compadre answered kent
and i wonder just how far the other
side await our playmates 

  who can say well meet them soon
enough por ciertamente

  sooner if we had horses an-
swered kent as they climbed the rough
slopes i wonder why mother spain
does not use horses in the legion 
they are a double expense one
must carry food for them there is
nothing for them in the desert and
perhaps we should be too comfortable
that would not do you know for a
soldier


the popular magazine

  si compadre the french legion
do not have horses either they use
a few mules and we have our own
loyal little borricos and what is so un-
tiring and patient as a spanish don-
key

  donkey mused rivas i think we
are all donkeys in the legion extran-
jero eh amigo

  hm-m-m si compadre-

  for a moment kent wondered what
had brought rivas into the legion
with the strange tact of all legionarios
however he had refrained from asking
that one forbidden question of the inner
life of a legionario in the legion
espanol what was past-was past
yesterdays did not matter-except to
forget to-morrow manana was what
counted to live to fight to die fight-
ing like a man and a true legionario
these were the codes dear to the heart
of the legion what mattered the past
out there under africas silent nights
where all human life was cemented to-
gether against one common enemy-the
vandal djicheur at the peak of the
hill the little band of almost two hun-
dred soldiers circled the pinnacle kent
surveyed the surrounding countryside
to rivas he said

  this is well amigo dont you
think 

   si teniente
    

  kent wheeled about put up his hand
in signal to his men

  com-pan-ia pa-r-a he shouted the
hoarse command

  the men came to a weary shuffling
halt rivas commanded his own com-
pany in like manner

  unpack ordered kent we camp
here for the night salazar post the
sentries to all sides of the hill we
sleep in a circle around the peak bor-
ricos and rations in the center ma-
chine guns set up for action not a
stitch of clothing off rifles in your
hands while you sleep ammunition
belts around you cold soup for sup-

per we want no telltale fires lighted
break off

  in a few moments the borricos had
been unpacked and were nibbling at the
few stray stubs of drinn grass that
jutted from between the rocks sen-
tries took their posts tin pans rattled
indistinctly here and there as the thick
soup and hard bread was passed among
them voices mumbled into the clear
crisp air from little knots here and
there the tiny red glows of cigarette
ends glimmered through the groups
while the sharp odor of crude tobacco
smoke drifted down the wind

   as night settled down in stark silence
the cold penetrating and bitter encom-
passed the men not a more piercing
chill in the world attacks human life
than that of the desert cold over the
atlas mountains of morocco the men
shifted uneasily uncomfortably in their
troubled sleep and huddled closer to-
gether for the warmth of their tired
bodies

   for a long time kent sat in quiet re-
flection his poncho drawn tightly
around his shoulders puffing at his
battered old brier pipe he clutched its
hot bowl almost desperately in his fist
a moment if one could only forget
-if one could only escape ones
thoughts-escape oneself  suddenly
the stubbled plains of his old american
southwest drifted dreamily before his
eyes he saw the home hacienda of
his fathers down on the mexican bor-
der

  there had been a girl a romance
soft border night with the stars all
aglow-different than these lonely
african ones where nightly one cried
out to shut off those piercing stars that
glared unceasingly metallically down
with never a cloud to break the awful
monotony

  the girl had given him that fine
brier pipe he had had a rival sharp
words started over personal rights and
infringements of those rights there
the legion of manana



followed a ribald fight in the house of
the young woman it all happened dur-
ing a garden party

  kent had been obstreperous one
thing led to another until he had found
disfavor from the one person in the
world whom he loved but who did not
love him in return his father was a
stern taskmaster anita had censured
him as a boor and a rowdy later she
scorned him it was too much for him
to bear

  in the fire of the moment the im-
pulsiveness of youth-for kent had yet
to see his twenty-seventh birthday-he
had put them all behind him and taken
a working passage on a small spanish
freighter out of corpus christi he
had not asked where she was bound
it did not matter he liked the latin
races he had picked up spanish on
the border and with a resourceful dis-
position awaited the decree of fate

  this decree he accepted three weeks
later on the ancient quay in cadiz
spain at that moment he was broke
while at his wits ends he found him-
self staring at a poster of the spanish
foreign legion acting as always on
impulse he signed-for five years
before the end of his first however he
had risen from a private to a sergeant
and during the siege of abdel krim
in  he had rescued his wounded
comandante cordoba then a captain
under fire for this consideration he
had been made a lieutenant

  kent laughed grimly back home in
tucson he had been ostracized because
of a fist fight here day by day he
stared dame death between the eyes
and a fist fight was something that
scarcely commanded passing notice
life was strange he thought when
relatively compared rivas stirred un-
easily beside him kent drew his com-
rades poncho over his shoulders cover-
ing his brother officer better

  before him on the crest of the hill
he saw the huge form of butchy star-

ing moodily across the camp his heavy
back cutting off the stars he too was
still awake thinking brooding was the
better word for it kent figured

  kent did not know when he had fallen
asleep nor how long he had slept when
he was roughly awakened by a sudden
tugging at his shoulder

  teniente ten-ien-te an excited
anxious voice was calling in his ear

  si si answered kent staggering
to his knees what is it he faced
a lone sentry bending over him his
rifle shadowing through the gloom

  there are flames beyond toum
agoug sir

  flames toum agoug que hora
esf what is the hour 

  a little after two sir

  leaping to his feet kent grabbed
his binoculars from his chin straps and
stared into the east yes one didnt
need binoculars to see those lurid white-
and-scarlet tongues licking toward the
stars off there in the desert a chill
raced down his spine

  for a breathless second he pondered
running his right hand over his chin
then he bent low over rivas and shook
him gently quickly

  compadre up theres trouble
on the trail

  rivas raised to elbow posture

  kent lifted rivass binoculars to his
companions eyes and pointed beyond
the blinking lights of toum agoug
see for yourself

  kent then flung about to his sentry
how long has this been going on
just broke out sir-this moment
rivas jumped to his feet now fully
awake excited his binoculars still
pressed to his eyes he clutched kent
sharply by the arm

  ricardo its beyond the ksar on
the caravan trails

  yes thats the trouble it looks
black for the caravans black

  si amigo si

  the many legionarios hearing the


the popular magazine

sharp voices of their officers were shak-
ing themselves from their slumber
how far do you figure it ricardo
about five kilometers he hesi-
tated thoughtfull  an hours march
the men have had six hours sleep
si answered rivas not enough
after thirty kilometers of heavy march-
ing

  it will have to be enough stated
kent doggedly we must hit the trail
to his legionarios kent shouted
despierto awake a las armas
to arms we march

  in wild scrambling the weary legion-
arios tumbled from their blankets and
staggered to their feet wiping the stub-
born slumber from their red-rimmed
eyes

  fix bayonets commanded kent
ready for quick march a flagon of
rum apiece

  tin cups rattled the rum was
poured out and gulped down to revive
the men and put fire into their blood
lips smacked suddenly from the
northern end of the camp came wild
howls of dismay kent leaped hotly to
his feet what was wrong now

  las ametralladoras the machine
guns

  kent stamped vigorously among the
shadows of his men

  silencio he growled whats the
trouble

  our machine guns gasped the
breathless one a sentry six of them
senor are missing-have been pillaged
while we slept

  de veras spat kent vitreously
and where were my sentries asleep
too

  one and all the sentries crowded
about kent

  i saw nothing senor but darkness

makes-

  all was silent teniente from an-
other i watched-

  blood of my life groaned kent
helplessly have i soldiers here-or

children he glared at his nonplused
men dont stand there like sun-
dazed lizards to the trail perhaps
a court-martial would help you to keep
a better watch pack up

  for a moment kent studied anx-
iously it was not the first time in his
desert experiences that those silent
ones had slipped into his circles with
the quietness of death itself and re-
moved things including life from their
very midsts

  it was usually rifles and ammunition
but machine guns evidently they
were closer to el corsarios silent ones
than they had realized for a grim sec-
ond kents eyes rested on the sullen
back of butchy that neer-do-well
shifted away uneasily as though kents
vision had penetrated his comforts

  come here rat blazed kent with
an almost madmans growl the
legionarios around him started the
americano was hot it was time to
keep moving slowly the ex-sergeant
drew up toward kent even in that
starry gloom kent recognized butchys
face was pale the russians face was
not one to pale easily

  oiga you yellow vermin blazed
kent threateningly if i ever find out
that youve had anything to do with
these missing guns words of a yanqui
ill see you hanged in the barracks
square

  i know nothing about- snarled

butchy in a low growl

  shut up rasped kent and
watch yourself just one false move
out of you and ill have you where
even the djicheur wont recognize
you

bayonet and scimitar

tphe remaining machine guns were
knocked down and lashed onto the
patient backs of the little borricos
marching packs were reshifted on the
backs of the men
the legion of manana



  adelante commanded kent for-
ward  quick step

  scrambling over boulders slipping
sliding down the shadowy hill the
legionarios with their borricos hur-
riedly felt their way through the dark-
ness to the dram-splotched plains below
them for the first time in many
months the men were glad to be cold
burdened with their numerous ban-
doleras of cartridges and heavy packs
they puffed and perspired on the fast
rout march the borricos overladen
picked their way as best as their in-
stincts could tell them yet they brought
down constant showers of rock and
pebbles after the men as the leaping
fires of toum agoug rose closer be-
fore them kent roused his men to fight-
ing pitch

  well be going into action in a few
minutes men he yelled hoarsely over
his shoulder as he ran i want you
all to stick together well be among
the dunes beyond toum agoug you
know how easy it is to get lost in the
dark that means capture by the
djicheur-torture keep your eyes on
your officers and your noncoms and
give these bloody desert rats everything
youve got

  a lusty murmur of assent went up
in throaty yells from the men action
they caught the word to their fighting
hearts it was meat and drink to the
legionarios by night or by day to fight
their common foe the djicheur of old
morocco too they had seen their
americano leader rush over the crim-
son saharan dunes before they knew
kent was able to carry them to victory
if any living soldier could

  their teniente flared up now and
then lost his temper but the causes
were many and they had come to know
that kent hacfa heart and looked after
their comforts gladly would they fol-
low him into the very jaws of hell if
circumstance demanded his reckless
daring brought admiration to their souls

  putting the rocky plains behind them
the men entered a narrow gorge the
tramp of their hurrying feet and the
rapid clatter of the donkeys resounded
in warning challenge against the stony
walls of the ravine panting lungs
breathed deep on the moist night air
with its sharp sagelike pungence of the
drinn grass while the odors of the
frothing donkeys stiffened the nostrils

  as suddenly as if a curtain had been
drawn then the gorge fell away to their
rear and the great starry bowl of the
heavens spread before them a rolling
wave of warmer air off the desert met
them sand dunes like an endless
heaving sea yet silent spread before
them-the sahara endless and soulless
-the home of the legionario

  a few hundred yards beyond them
leaped and crackled those livid flames of
disaster rising falling and rising
again to the stars they danced and flared
into the lonely night kent halted his
men breathlessly in husky voice he
commanded

  to your stomachs down

  as one the men fell exhaustedly to
their faces on the sand

  get your breath for a minute to
his sergeant he called salazar
softly then the two men climbed to
the peak of a near-by dune as they
reached its summit their feet sinking
knee-deep through the soft sands they
simultaneously gasped the dark lum-
bering shadow of a camel swept down
the opposite slope of the dune and away
for the scene of the fire

  a djicheur scout spat kent
were discovered

  si mi teniente

  salazar jerked his rifle to his shoulder
to fire kent pushed it down quickly

  no a shot will bring them on our
heels before the scout can notify them
weve little enough time to get into
action as it is viciously he jabbed his
binoculars to his eyes again and studied
the scene


the popular magazine

  hundreds of horsemen riding at top
speed were circling the crackling flames
while they rode some fired their long
muskets kent shuddered perhaps it
was torture they of the legion
espanol understood djicheur torture
many a legionario escaped from those
wild tribal scenes of ghastliness had
brought back terrible truths beyond
the fires kent saw shadowy groups-
the djicheur women that always fol-
lowed their men into battle to pass along
the ammunition for a grim second he
studied the fires then he distinguished
the wheels and seats of burning motor
cars

  the caravans theyve captured
them all right were late comrade
quick

  bending low staggering through the
soft sands the two legionarios sped
back to their company

 kent shouted to his men up
load rifles fix bayonets and secure
them well he crowded close to his
faithfuls grabbed rivas by the arm
listen brave ones he counseled
hoarsely el corsario has already in-
tercepted the caravans we attack now
but take care you do not shoot the
civilian travelers rivas you take the
north flank ill take the south well
try to surround them and get on the
other side of their camp get your
machine guns into action at once
bien we go adelante

  with wild screams of battle the dark
shadows of the legionarios swept off
into the night here and there the men
jerked their stoical little borricos around
and feverishly unlashed their packs of
machine guns and ammunition within
a few moments those ominous three-
cornered machine-gun tripods were jut-
ting from the high peaks of those shad-
owy sand dunes then down one slope
and up the other still nearer the flam-
ing holacaust the machine guns pressed
toward el corsarios bloody night ma-
rauders rallying his men his legion

saber flashing against the dancing lights
of the fires kent circled the very
fringes of the churning djicheurs

  confusion suddenly gripped the rid-
ing horsemen as a lone white figure on
a camel rushed swayingly among them
the legion they were coming
quickly the riders spread out and off
into the dark shadows of the dunes the
desert women pulled their black robes
around them and scrambled to their feet
from rivass dunes to the northward
there crackled the sharp rata-tac-taca-
tac-tac of a machine gun going into ac-
tion a white wave of djicheur robes
suddenly rose seemingly from nowhere
and yet from everywhere over those
sand hills not fifty feet from kent and
his plunging fighting men

  charge he shrieked his saber
high over his head his pistol in his left
hand held straight before him

  machine guns jibbered out their
deathly chant from the sand hills behind
them

  viva espaiia viva viva viva
the battle cries of spirit swelled the air

  ul-ul ui-allah il-allah allah ak-
bar il-il-allah the scream of kill
howled from the dry throats of the
djicheurs

  legionarios threw coston flares
hissingly the arc-white lights spluttered
black night into flaring day this the
djicheur hated he worked better like
the wolf by the dark of night in
metallic clash djicheur scimitar and
legion bayonet rattled into one another
kent saw berecci their little italian cor-
poral fairly jerked off his feet on the
long point of a scarlet scimitar thrust
by a great moor towering twice his
size immediately behind him how-
ever oscar a big dane ripped the
moor wide open with his bayonet
kents blood curdled with his  he
fired time and time again into those
white djeelabad robes that rose like a
flood before him

  the enemies closed it was body to
the legion of manana



body now cuerpo d cuerpo a lumber-
ing djicheur his face lighted in a bes-
tial jackallike grimace from the flares
of the fire rushed over kent he
jerked up his saber plunged in the
eerie light of a dying coston flare he
caught the glint of a curved-steel scimi-
tar sweeping over his head heard its
deathly swish in the dark he dodged
plunged with his saber again forms
were closing around him a scream of
terror throaty gurgles a weighty
arab his camels-hair robe wet with
sweat sank heavily over kent who
staggered to his knees with the weight

  rifle bullets shrieked past kents ears
and whined into the sands around him
wrenching his saber clear he wiped the
scarlet blade on the robe of his attacker
and once more leaped to his feet just
in time to parry a blow from a legion
bayonet held in the hands of a short
thickset bedouin white teeth curled
back against a shadowy bronzed face
and with a curse from allah the be-
douin toppled backward

  behind him kent heard their legion
machine guns clattering away to his
left he saw whole lines of djicheurs
double in their tracks as the streams of
machine-gun lead shrieked into their
midsts some clutched their stomachs
and shot headlong others silently flung
their scimitars or muskets over their
heads and toppled in jerking heaps to
relinquish their lifeless forms to mo-
hommet

  a mi la legion the scream of
terror the last desperate distress call of
the legion pierced the night behind
kent like an icy chill it ran down his
spine

  he flung about holmes a brave
little englishman and salazar doubled
over their machine-gun tripod while a
lumbering djicheur violently plunged
his scimitar again and again through the
quivering body of holmes red lights
dancing before his eyes kent yanked
up his  steadied himself and then

fired again and again the ghostly
robed djicheur lurched heavily forwards
and curled atop the silent form he had
just been torturing a bullet whistled
searingly through kents right ear lobe
and whined off into the east-the east
like a surge of fire through his realiza-
tion that lone shot was telegraphed to
kents mind his body went stiff
warm wet blood trickled down his
cheek and off his chin that shot had
come from behind his back

  treachery

  kent whirled around stared into that
dense darkness behind numeirous fig-
ures darted through the gloom no
time clutching the sweat-slippery
handle of his saber once more he forced
his weary body over the next row of
soft dunes here and there among the
hills he noted shadowy lumps of human
bodies resting silently the screams of
the wounded and the dying sounded on
all sides

  ul-ul allah-akbar ul ul-ul-

 viva espana viva viva-

  on and on through that scarlet night
the crash of machine guns and desultory
fire of musket hammered out the death
knell shoving fresh clips into his 
swinging his saber over his head in rally
to his men kent slithered down dune
after dune and up new slopes into the
very heart of the djicheur camp ene-
mark the swede and ligne the
frenchman drew up behind him with a
machine gun

  para halt shouted kent hold
it where you are open fire there

  rata-tac-taca-tac-taca-tac the last
onslaught of djicheur muskets crackled
about them fully two dozen horsemen
circled them to the south-not fifty feet
away

  they were now but a short distance
from the burning automobiles the
place was as bright as day the firing
from the legionarios was more infre-
quent now kent dully realized ahead
he saw a mesa of sand level for some


the popular magazine

distance seven automobiles burned on
the sandy plain dry drinn grass was
stacked near by waiting to be piled on
the fires to keep them burning a
number of mouse-colored tents were be-
ing folded frantically up and dragged
away the djicheur was fleeing put
to rout

   as kent stared at the fleeing djicheur
from tired bloodshot eyes a sudden
feeling of awe and fearful apprehension
swept over him he realized through
his aching mind that the night was fast
becoming all silent around him why
that boded evil he whirled about

  enemark and ligne lay broken heaps
on the ground beside their machine gun
as if in ill omen then a hissing red
rocket coming from the direction of
rivass company shot searingly sky-
ward its scarlet tail flared across the
heavens in warning-the last hopeless
signal of distress

   in soft plushy drops the bits of burn-
ing red chemical splashed onto the sands
around kent and sputtered like water
on a hot griddle rivas kents heart
went out to his comrade had his com-
pany been wiped out

  there came the sandy rush of hoof-
beats at kents back riding up from
the rear swept a half dozen charging
arabian horses while in front of him
ran three charging djicheurs brandish-
ing their scimitars over wild turbaned
heads he was cornered it was the-
end kent realized his dark moment

  adelante forward he shouted to
his men

  silence a silence as deep as the
grave frantically kent stared out be-
hind him not a single legionario was
there to come to his aid alone face
to face with the enemy surrounded
overwhelmed with desperation-im-
pelled feet he swerved back and fell
atop their nearest machine gun spun
it around on its tripod until it faced
those three wild djicheurs racing down
on foot to beribbon him rata-ta-tac-

jaca-taca-tac- if the gun would

only continue not jam the barrel
was white hot

  what living thing animal or man
could charge into that spouting nozzle
of death the machine gun nothing
screams on screams of savage revenge-
defeated terror split the air then
scrambling around on his trembling
knees he took aim on those riding horse-
men flying past him in the night rata-
taca-tac-tac-

  as the lights of the caravan fires
brightened the dunes around him kent
suddenly grappled the trips on his guns
-held them-ceased firing

  something stuck in his throat he
sank lower to his knees and trembled
with anger and apprehension from head
to foot he took aim again hesitated
aimed then stopped wide of eye he
stared not wishing to believe the sight
that met his eyes icy perspiration
burst out over his body trickled down
his chest and spine before him not
a dozen feet away two black horses
reared to a standstill on the leading
one kent recognized the menacing face
of el corsario-but behind him be-
hind him on the horse was the lurching
pale figure of a white girl

  her long blond hair was completely
disheveled and streamed out over the
frothing coat of the spirited animal
behind the first horse was a second
atop that frightened animal was another
white girl the remaining horsemen
had sped off into the dark shadows of
the night el corsario raised his car-
bine to shoot kent then he saw the
ominous blue glint of the legion ma-
chine gun his arms hesitated he
had had experience with those death
hoses before frantic kent could not
shoot for fear of hitting the girl el
corsario came to a sliding halt nearer
kent kent plunged ahead another few
feet with his machine gun

  you moslem murderer he shouted
fiercely in arabic making war on
the legion of manana



women and civilians you coward
comitadchi you desert rat let the
girl go before i drill you to ribbons

  a brutal mocking laugh cut the night
desperately kent stared into the blue
muzzle of the great djicheurs carbine

  el yanqui eh the big yankee
would fire on el corsario eh very
well fire infidel fire he taunted

  with a raucous laugh the desert van-
dal plunged his steel spurs into the sides
of his spirited horse with a wild bel-
low the animal shot ahead

  oh oh screamed the girl hys-
terically do something do some-
thing 

  trembling with consternation kent
held his machine gun fingered his trips
his limbs rigid over the tripod while
beads of perspiration poured out over
his body he was helpless

  youll pay for this you lousy
jackal screamed kent word of a
yanqui if it costs me my life ill
thrust this saber through your dirty
heart

  word of a yanqui word of the
big yankee barked el corsario mock-
ingly and lunged off into that black sea
of sand and stars that melted on and
on into infinity

  the second horseman a tremendous
fellow in the flowing blue robes of a
sheikh spurted past kent tossed a
lumpy bundle toward him it rolled to
a stop near kents feet a bestial
lauph followed

  a gift from allah

  a cloud of sand showered over kent
as the second horseman plunged after
corsario with sinking heart he stared
after those bulking shadows that gal-
loped into the dense blackness of the
sahara silence for a moment kent
seemed not to notice that bundle all
he could see were those blue eyes filled
with tears illuminated against the wild
firelight and the silken blond hair flow-
ing helplessly back over the dark body
of the horse that sight he knew

would haunt him for the remainder of
his days

  bitterness surging through his soul
kent looked about not a moving
thing met his gaze all around him in
the last sputtering lights of the coston
flares and the caravan fires lay lumping
white-robed and khaki forms-quiet
silent forms was he all alone with the
dead keeping watch with the dead
gruesome chills engulfed him had
he been of an emotional nature he would
have sobbed

  they of the legion had destroyed
that band of corsarios thrown death
into its heart and ribald confusion into
those few remaining the legion had
been victorious in battle but had suf-
fered a killing defeat in loss of num-
bers and in achievement kent was
heartsick in a day the desert corsair
would gather several hundred more of
his wandering tribes around him and
continue his vandalisms and reprisals
exhausted body aching his mind a
mental brain fire kent dazedly picked
up the queer parcel beside him there
in the strange silence of the dead he ex-
amined the curious leather lashings it
was wrapped in goatskin and about ten
by fourteen inches in diameter what
could it contain

chapter iv

shifting sands

 ent turned the goatskin bundle
around in his hands and ripped off
the tough thongs the stiff dried skin
flipped outward flat before him tum-
bled a soft roll of cloth the texture
was damp to kents touch he drew
his flashlight from out his pocket and
snapped on the switch the tiny beam
swept over the strange parcel the
khaki tunic of a lieutenant of the
legion extranjero

  the damp stains were crimson-
crimson with the lifeblood of a com-
rade through the left breast was a


the popular magazine

 deep scimitar or saber rip underneath
 the khaki tunic was a smaller object
 kent lifted it to the light a gorra
 or cap of a legion officer

   rivas compadre mio he mur-
 mured fervently they got you eh
 with a wild gesture of despair kent
 leaped furiously to his feet and swung
 toward the east and the vandal corsair
 fleeing with the american girl

   dazedly kent tucked the treasured
 tunic under his arm and turned to de-
 termine the results of the terrible
 slaughter pocket flashlight in hand
 he roved up and down the dunes and
 around their soft slopes tenderly he
 turned over the limp forms of his brave
 legionarios one after another in rows
 and singles lay the winnowed slain
 but in more than triple their own num-
  her lay the members of corsarios
 bloody bands everywhere it seemed
 were strewn those ghostly white djee-
 labas of the enemy standing on the
 tall peak of a dune kent trembled from
 head to foot with horror

   he recalled the words of comandante
 cordoba during the conference the
 dead will keep watch with the dead
 how true they were in those gravelike
 silences about him

   teniente a mi la legion t-en

 - the stricken plea for help like a

 whisper from the dead floated out on
 africas silent night

   kent flipped about as though a white-
 hot scimitar point had touched his ear-
 drum to his left among the gloomy
 shadows he saw the dim outline of one
 of their machine guns from it a
 strange form was groping across the
 sands on its hands and knees kent
 struck off for his comrade

   sal-a-zar murmured kent ex-
 citedly then you are not dead

   no amigo but-

   dropping to his knees beside his
 loyal sergeant kent lifted his head into
 his arms blood trickled from salazars
 right temple grabbing his handker-

 chief kent held it under his canteen
 and soaked it with water tenderly
 he bathed the head wound then ban-
 daged it

  agua agua breathed the ser-
geant

  lifting his canteen kent poured a
long draft of water down the legion-
arios throat the stout spaniard set-
tled back and breathed more comfort-
ably by the light of his flash kent in-
spected the wound then he slipped the
crude bandage back into place

  thats a bullet crease  pronounced
kent encouragingly just knocked you
out the loss of blood has left you
weak plenty of water and a little
rest will soon put you to rights he
lifted his canteen of water to the lips
of his mate again drink hearty he
urged

  salazar took another deep pull on
the canteen somewhat revived he
staggered to his feet and leaned against
his officer

  together then the two men arm in
arm walked through that saharan
graveyard stark and staring beneath the
lonely stars

  beyond one ridge of sand hills they
came across a remnant of the cooks
pack near it they discovered the cask
of company rum eagerly they pounced
on it poured the fiery liquid down their
aching throats it gave them new
strength and added freshness hurry-
ing among the slain kent obtained sev-
eral canteens emptied them of their
contents and filled two of them with
rum he passed one to salazar rest-
ing on the sand

  the legionario took it gratefully
kent swung the second canteen over
his own shoulder and kept an extra can-
teen of water so that he possessed three
in all salazar also possessed himself
of an additional one for water was
precious

  sliding down a tall dune they were
suddenly startled by a queer swishing

pop-b
the legion of manana



noise through the sand kent swept
his hand back against his comrade in
sharp warning the two halted breath-
lessly friend or enemy swiftly a
huge shadow lurched swayingly through
the gloom it was a dromedary

  the men breathed once more
crunching along the big beast was pull-
ing a huge robed figure behind it on
the end of several lashings dashing
up to the frightened animal kent
jerked it to a halt a big djicheur
whose soul had long since sped into the
mohammedan east was being dragged
along by his feet kent untangled the
pack trappings and threw the lines over
the neck of the dromedary a lucky
find taking a firm hand on the lines
of his captured prize kent and his
comrade walked about the scene

  butchy kent noted was among those
missing legion prisoners had been
taken one thing worried kent greatly
it started his mind thinking thoughts
repulsive to him their radio set was
nowhere to be found it was possible
of course that the djicheur had cap-
tured that too yet it was not probable
that he would bother with it more
likely would he be to smash it up there
on the spot the desert tribesmen knew
nothing of radio

  a mi la legion a mi- from

the westward came that dreaded distress
call

  frozen in their tracks the two lis-
tened

  its that way whispered salazar
toward the mountains

  they dashed toward the sound in
a trice they had reached a gray shadow
lumping through the gloom it was
karl gadke a tough-hearted german
one of rivass men the two bent
low over their comrade he was hold-
ing the muzzle of his rifle to his brains
to blow them out in the event that his
captors developed to be djicheurs-had
saved his last cartridge for that express
purpose

 pop-b

  companero murmured kent anx-
iously

  si coughed the other hoarsely
qtie dolor what pain the pallid
form settled back weakly in wide-eyed
relief

  kent looked over his wounds care-
fully a deep scimitar gash gored the
chest and a blue arm rip showed where
a djicheur bullet had seamed its way
toward the shoulder the german had
suffered a heavy loss of blood and was
weakened with pain kent held his
canteen of rum to the germans lips

  here karl drink

  the legionario drank and eagerly
deftly then aided by salazar kent
bandaged their third and last survivor
and got him to his feet through some
freak of luck four of their stanch little
borricos had escaped injury with an
almost human desire for companionship
the shaggy little animals had wandered
up to their masters salazar took them
in leash kent heaved a deep choking
sigh from those two full companies
of the legion espanol that had set out
the previous day from ait ahmed only
three were living-uncaptured

  from two companies totalling some
hundred and seventy men and thirty
men in the machine-gun groups-three
accountable desperate with stabbing
thoughts kent sat atop a tall sand dune
he turned to salazar

  that means corsario took seventy-
six prisoners amigo thats too many

  there was a significant silence among
the three men each knew what the
other was thinking seventy-six
legionarios could not have very well
been captured unless they had wanted
to be or unless they had unwittingly
been led into a trap things just didnt
go that way in the legion deser-
tions as in the french legion were
numerous enough yet these seldom oc-
curred under fire there were ugly
thoughts and thoughts unwelcome to
the minds of the three


the popular magazine

  capture by the djicheur or moor
meant a fate far worse than death
through the most heinous tortures ever
devised in the satanic mind of man
most of the legionarios whether of the
spanish or french legions preferred to
die by their own hands quickly and effi-
ciently it was for this reason that
they retained their last cartridge for
themselves on the sahara

  for this reason as well it was al-
most unknown for the djicheur to take
large numbers of prisoners when this
occurred there was always some signi-
ficance attached to it kent was seri-
ously troubled over the point he
turned toward salazar who shifted un-
easily

  what do you make of the mystery
sargento kent inquired

  who knows stated the spaniard
with a philosophic shrug of his shoul-
ders strange things can happen on
the sahara in the pitch dark of night

  and have acknowledged kent
but this one-this one mocks my wits
he shook himself nervously a dank
nausea overwhelming him there among
the slumbering dead come

  the men stood wonderingly to their
feet and looked toward kent for his
decision as to their next moves with
the captured dromedary kent believed
he might be able to overtake el cor-
sario or at least maintain trace of his
whereabouts and simultaneously learn
something of his lost comrades so that
he might later be able to acquaint the
legion of matters if he only had
radio then he could let his coman-
dante know the points of his arrival and
departure one came to depend on
those light-fast electrical messengers of
radio across the trackless miles and it
did not add to ones confidence nor
efficiency when they were taken from
one somehow he must get informa-
tion back to his post

  a chill raced down his spine as he
thought of those american girls he

must do something quick and certain if
he would aid them word must be
sent back to ait ahmed so that re-
enforcements could be sent and the
chase continued he turned to his two
faithfuls

  salazar you must hurry back to the
post you two see gadke to the hos-
pital ride two of the borricos then
get to comandante cordoba and tell him
what has happened tell him also that
i have gone on a course into the south-
east to keep the trail on el corsario so
that he will not escape i will mark
the-

  por dios exclaimed salazar des-
perately surely you are not going
alone into that ant nest of the djicheur
it will mean your death he placed
his hand affectionately on the shoulder
of his teniente there have been too


many already

  kent was thinking back on the words
of his admired comandante to his
sargento he reminded

  we of the legion extranjero have
a trust to fulfill with civilians they
look to us for protection we are sol-
diers we are here in africa to fight
-to die fighting if necessary but never
to consider our own worthless skins
when we should risk them in a worthy
cause for others our only hope for
capturing the american girls locating
our lost comrades and bringing that
desert lisdrd corsario to legion jus-
tice is to cut off his escape to do
that we must not lose his trail once
lost it will be like looking for rowboats
on the atlantic who knows what
course he may take on the morrow i
go-on the bloody trail of el corsario

  he struck his right hand out to his
legionarios with his left hauled around
the nose of his providentially found
dromedary

  buena suerte good luck my brave
ones tell the comandante that i will
take a course toward the oasis of el
ougadir it is most likely that corsario
the legion of manana



will try to reach that as his next objec-
tive so that he may fill his water bags

  he unrolled rivass scarlet tunic from
under his arm with grim jaw he
added

  tell the comandante also that i will
mark my trail with bits of this khaki
tunic from our brave departed teniente
rivas i will pick djicheur spears from
the dead and will set those spear points
on the tops of the tallest sand dunes as
i make my trail bien let us hurry
adios

  adios rejoiced both the legion-
arios faithfully y vaya usted con
dios tambien

  there on the wide sahara in the
strange silences of the dead the legion-
arios parted swinging atop his drome-
dary kent shuffled through the sands
to the center of the battlefield there
he gathered a dozen or more spears from
the gory objects that jutted staringly
skyward from the sand

  he lashed the wooden staffs to his
shaggy animal and with a fighting bit-
terness in his heart swung past the last
dying embers of the burning caravan
as he rode strange troubled visions
danced and wavered through his mind
the flowing blond hair and the blue
eyes of the american girl haunted his
waking and dreaming hours thus it
was that teniente kent of the legion
extranjero espanol nodded sleepily
along on his swaying dromedary on
and on into the southeast behind the trail

pawn flaming and foreboding was
shooting her red arrows into the sky
when richard kent  next opened his
red-rimmed eyes to the new day aches
and pains drove through his body jerk-
ing and snapping on the back of his
lurching dromedary his right ear lobe
caked with dried blood throbbed and

burned anxiously he stared at the
sands ahead of his plodding animal
the many tracks of marching feet
camels and horses had churned up the
deserts floor into the southeast

  he wondered how long he had slept
or dozed in that stuperous state rid-
ing like a dead man across the sandy
wastes as a huge dune rose before
him he urged his animal snarling and
growling against his command and
lazily hoping to skirt the tall hill
straight up the soft embankment at
its summit of some two hundred feet
he halted and stiffly dismounted dis-
dainfully sniffing the air high above
kents head the dromedary waited
chewing its cud nose into the wind

  dropping to his knees on the sands
kent inspected the tracks it was not
easy to discern the exact delineations of
those footprints in that sand flourlike
in its softness and gold-tan in color
but he was sure of one thing and that
was that shoes and not djicheur sandals
had made those prints legion shoes
had the djicheur after all taken his
legionairos prisoners reaching up to
the sides of his dromedary he snatched
one of the long spears some seven or
eight feet in length then ripping off a
piece of rivass tunic he placed the
crimson strip on the dunes peak as his
first marker on his unknown trek

  he reached for his binoculars but
as he did so he realized that they were
not hanging on his neck during the
engagement or during the wild ride of
the night he had lost them he cursed
making a sunshade with his hands he
peered with straining eyes into the
southeast

  a splendid vista was commanded from
the peak as far as he could see
stretched the seemingly unending sea of
sand and sun sun and sand with not
a tree not a blade of grass to break
the lonely monotony of the place more
desolate more silent than the ocean was
that scene

  an overwhelming loneliness mingled
with sadness surged through kents
heart as he stared into the burning
wind and then swung toward his an-
cient-looking dromedary

  swinging atop his desert transport
he swayed on and on into the blazing
southeast through the long hours of
that august day he prodded his animal
farther farther into the fated east
every ten kilometers or so he would
set a marker with its tragic strip of
legion cloth or a strip and a button
the last spear he saved with rivass
gorra for his final marker

  at times he felt he- would never be
able to continue life under that blazing
torch of the sahara sun its rays were
scorching through his own gorra and
into his blistering skull like an acetylene
torch the back of his neck although
covered with a corbata dropped from
his gorra felt as though it were exposed
to the open door of a powerful blast
furnace

  when he felt himself swooning with
unconsciousness he would take a sip of
rum or a bit of water or chew on
some of his legion emergency rations
then he would once more be able to
distinguish that red rim of the desert
that danced and wavered crazily before
him into phantom mirages of green
palms and water holes should his
dromedary succumb suddenly he real-
ized it would mean his death out there
on that barren sea before help would
reach him such was the life of a
legionario

  how he survived that day kent could
never have explained he knew though
that he never wanted to see another
its equal this one had been seared
into his memory in letters of white heat
when the blinding red ball of the desert
sun sank slowly in the fiery west kent
rode more a scorched skeleton than a
living man he knew that it had been
an excessive saharan day with the
thermometer hovering somewhere in the

neighborhood of a hundred and forty
degrees

  after sunset one might expect a
violent sirocco or sand storm like the
thunder showers of america following
a scorching summers day followed the
siroccos in the wake of those summer
saharan days when the sun rose with
what was termed violent rise in
africa the sirocco however left no
cooling effect afterward it was just
wind and sand and more wind and
then more and more heat with never a
cloud to sweep the sky

  they were as dangerous and dreaded
on the desert as the tornado of other
parts of the world and often buried
whole caravans and even villages with
the quantity and weight of their falling
sand clouds kent his brain and body
tortured with a million aches and pains
urged his weary dromedary to the
heights of another dune and again
stared into the distant enemy east

  his glazed eyeballs danced and
jerked as though being drawn by heated
wires he shaded his eyes rolled his
lids higher felt the creases in his fore-
head draw back and stared then
he laughed a dry hacking laugh green
trees in the offing white and gray ob-
jects-djicheur tents a tiny wreath of
yellow smoke curling skyward an
oasis leaning against the rough
shaggy coat of his dromedary kent
cackled out mocking chuckles

  see it there an oasis cool fresh
water rippling in the sunlight-deep and
clear like hell its a mirage a
mirage i tell you the sahara

  then he checked himself was he
going mad talking to his dromedary
could he believe his eyes though  one
never could on the sahara how could
one trust a weary mind and glassy
sun-swollen eyeballs swaying weakly
against that shaggy brown back kent
stared at his pocket compass south-
east direction was right before him
the sands were still cut and churned
the legion of manana



where the djicheur had traced his mad-
cap flight were his eyes telling him
right after all

  he would have to take a chance that
the vision that he witnessed was an
oasis in a few moments darkness
would be stealing upon him for there
was no twilight in those torrid tropic
lands with what seemed to kent his
last ounce of strength he drew out his
last spear from the side of his drome-
darys lashings with a violent jab he
plunged rivass gorrci the last bit of
his marking cloth down over the end
of the spear handle

  turning his back to the west and his
dune he swung atop his desert transport
and urged his swishing animal down
the powdery sides of the massive dune
down the hollows and up and over more
dunes he reeled and rocked across those
golden billows of sand like a lost ship
on a lost sea from time to time he
stared almost fearfully at that line of
thin gray wisp that curled skyward
was it really smoke it was black
now he thought he could make out
something faint and shadowy like a
line of palms waving faintly along the
horizon

  with the sinking of the blazing sun
a sudden relief came to the air the
killing blast of those white-hot rays was
gone gathering his wits kent thought
he had been in transit nearly fifteen
hours he had put the passes hills
behind him he should be by his dead
reckoning somewhere in the general
vicinity of el ougadir if he had held
his course correctly if he hadnt dozed
in that heat while his dromedary made
queer courses and if his animal had
made the speed he figured that must
be the oasis that smoke he could
be positive now

  el corsario had doubtless reached
the oasis if so it meant that kent
would soon be entering the most hazard-
ous lair of the most notorious of all
desert brigands

chapter vi

the camp of djicheur

jnce more the stars had come out
and the cooler moist atmosphere
of a saharan night had settled over
africas shifting sands when richard
kent shuffled his staggering dromedary
around the tall dunes that reared their
desolate heads protectingly near the
water hole of el ougadir tiny blazes
of camp fires curled skyward here and
there from among the palms kent
was already within a mile of the oasis
and well knew that el corsario would
have his sentries posted at all corners
of his outpost for the night extreme
caution would be compulsory if he were
to achieve anything

  dismounting apprehension throbbing
through his body kent forced his great
awkward dromedary to its knees and
willingly enough did the big animal sink
to rest then kent himself fell to his
stomach for a few minutes ease the
sands were still scorching from the heat
of the long summers day

  for several moments he rested thus
taking short drafts from his water and
rum canteens he dared not remain
long thus however for fear that his
great weariness should overwhelm him
and plunge him into a slumber as deep
as a drunken stupor-which assuredly
there on the wild sahara would mean
arude awakening

  rising stiffly to his knees he peered
over the top of his dune toward the
enemy encampment there was no
mistaking those oasis activities it was
the stronghold of the great corsair for
how long who could say but there was
no doubt in kents mind but that the
american girls were there and that his
captured legiomrio comtades were also
somewhere within its confines the
thoughts of his comrades their possible
torturings and of the terrible outcome
that might be the fate of the women
drove kent to fevered action


the popular magazine

  suddenly his heart seemed to turn to
chilled stone wide of eye he stared
into that dreaded east then he sank
hopelessly to his face into the hot sands
he wanted to cry out with the disap-
pointment his brain whirled with
feverish lights and queer dancings of
light and shadow there in the skies
above him tumbled an immense seeth-
ing cloud of gold-tan texture

  the sirocco

  bendito sea dios groaned kent
dejectedly am i to be buried alive

  the sands of the desert seemed sud-
denly to have been transported to the
heavens above in an awesome hurtling
vortex from out the east and across
the shadowy billows of that fathomless
sea rolled a great tan-white wave-a
wave of driving whistling sand backed
by a torrential wind whose velocity
knew no limits with the speed of
light it raced toward kent he bent
low behind the protecting slope of his
dune drew his corbata tightly over his
eyes and neck to protect them

  shrieking whining howl the com-
pelling drive of sand tons on tons of
it hurling horizontally down the wind
like spume across gale-driven sea it
obscured the light and plunged the
desert into instant blackness steadily
like the constant rush of a great water-
fall those sands of doom hurled their
age-old swishing fury into the farther
west driving driving whistling shriek-
ing swishing swishing-

  kent clenched his teeth and bent his
body bracingly against the giant sirocco
the terrifying ominous roar of that
rushing sand was like the scream of
death in his ears his dromedary kent
noted had remained on its exhausted
knees having swung its back to the
driving sand and tucked its long brown
nose under its forelegs

  kent wriggled upward it was diffi-
cult for he was already half buried in
the weight of the sands that covered
him and staggered toward his faithful

animal kicking it roughly in the stom-
ach he forced it to its feet-the stupid
stubborn dromedary would naturally re-
main there and make no effort to save
its life in the sirocco snarling and
endeavoring to bite kent the huge ani-
mal staggered to its feet throwing the
weight of sand from its back and im-
mediately sank into another hollow

  for a moment there came a slight lull
in the timbre of the gale kent wrig-
gled around and struggled to his knees
throwing the ponderous load from his
back and shoulders lifting his gorra
and corbata from his eyes he stared a
second into those tumbling clouds of the
murky east the sand drove into his
eyeballs like a hundred pricking pin
points stinging and sharp before him
where there had been his dune towering
some two hundred feet toward the stars
the billows had been reduced to a white
frothy level in seconds this had taken
place that first onslaught of the
bursting sand storm had passed and the
sirocco had settled into a more constant
fury the desert now was like a floor
the sand sweeping across it like black
smoke on a burning prairie there was
something inhuman maddening in that
terrifying never-ceasing swish like fall-
ing water penetrating eating through
the clothing and into the very body of
man

  constantly leaping to his feet to keep
from being buried alive with the fall-
ing sands then dropping again to his
side his back to the storm kent waited
for the first killing wave of the sirocco
to spend itself his neck face eye-
lids arms and hands smarted and
stung where the sand had eaten into his
already burning skin in the sultry op-
pressiveness of the storm-laden air
kent could barely breathe and those
fighting breaths obtained were filled
with the fine dust of the sirocco chok-
ing fighting for his life he swung about
once more and looked for his drome-
dary
the legion of manana



  kent knew not where to look for
him he was some place in the sands
below for the dromedary it was the
end perhaps months later perhaps
years perhaps in a few weeks or per-
haps never at all his skeleton of
bleached white bones would be uncov-
ered by another infuriated sirocco
which constantly rearranged and moved
the topography of africas sahara

  battling against the storm kent kept
constantly changing his position as
he did so his brain worked desperately
were all the fates against him was
it not enough to have lost his own entire
company that of his comrade rivass
and to have suffered defeat now the
storm gods of the desert had to throw
up tremendous barriers for him to strug-
gle against kents heart halted in its
beatings for the moment his markers
they were of course by now hurled
to the four unknown corners of the
sahara and buried the legion would
have no clew of his tracks to follow

  he tried standing to his feet he
held his own for a moment then a
powerful blast of wind bent him stag-
geringly to his knees he could not
determine the velocity of the sirocco of
course but he knew that it was well
over a hundred miles an hour

  if he could only make the secluding
walls of the palms that encircled the
el ougadir oasis it wasnt far but
in such a violent sirocco it might as
well have been at timbuktu dazedly
he studied out his fate he might
struggle across on his knees wriggle
on his stomach walk at odd moments
and make that fringe of palms by sheer
herculean plunges

  no telling how many hours the storm
might last sometimes they spent them-
selves in a couple of hours and then
again at times they raged for several
days as a general rule however they
seemed to follow the rising and setting
of the sun he told himself that he
must make the one last terrific struggle

to gain the oasis if he was buried
lost in the attempt he at least would be
dying with his boots on

  alone and lonely somehow kent
fought his way into the teeth of the
raging sirocco until the lashing fronds
of el ougadirs date palms roared out
over his head his mouth was half
filled with sand his eyes nearly blinded
the knee pads worn from his breeches
and his hands and kneecaps raw when
he sank exhaustedly within that rim of
the oasis where the palms thundered
their age-old saharan moaning

  he could see the high ramparts of
the abandoned legion blockhaus so
nicknamed by the german legionarios
that reared its crumbling sun-bleached
walls and high turrets from the lone
hill of el ougadir many years back
it had been an active outpost but with
the interim of years the active outposts
had been moved farther to the north and
civilization as the djicheur had become
more tamed since those earlier years
the blockhouse so rich in desert history
and stained with the crimson blood of
brave legionarios and battling djicheurs
had become the lonely haunt of lizards
languoring in the sweltering sun of
misdirected caravans and of the roving
gypsy tribes with now and again a band
of marching legionarios picketing their
rifles along its silent and deserted em-
brazures

  kent dropped quietly into a deep sane
hole beside the dried-up river bed that
wound through the oasis in secret he
waited tensely listening peering into
that opaque blackness before him al-
though the sand whistled through the
air over his head and cut shriekingly
into the trunks of the trees around him
the place was a paradise of a haven to
kent compared to the open desert

  of one thing he was quite calmly cer-
tain the sentries would have returned
to the camp and out of the sirocco el
corsario would know that night of
howling nights of sirocco of siroccos


the popular magazine

 no one could live out on that tossing
 sea of sand and death

   there would be no troublesome com-
 panies of the legion espanol to over-
 take or surprise him he was safe in
 that abandoned blockhouse which he had
 commandeered and had not the too
 altruistic legion been vanquished a
 momentary contentment settled over
 kent he realized that he had under-
 gone a very narrow escape with dame
 death

   but while the sirocco had nearly
 brought him to an untimely end at the
 samc time it had been a blessing in dis-
 guise for had it not allowed him to
 reach his present spot-almost within
 the very tent walls of the great corsair
 -undiscovered at least the fates had
 been kind enough to have allowed rim
 to get within a mile of the oasis before
 the storm broke

   a new hope pounded through kents
 fire-hot veins happily these new
 thoughts settled over him grimly he
 laughed he had stolen a march on el
 corsario the fighting tactics of the
 djicheur of old morocco were to move
 against the christian in mysterious
 barefooted silence under the cover of
 night during the excessive heat of the
 seasons and picking the very worst of
 those violently hot summer days when
 the anglo-saxon legionario the latin
 or the soldier of northern blood could
 not bear up under its terrific heat that
 sometimes mounted to an unbelievable
 temperature of a hundred fifty to a
 hundred sixty degrees the djicheur
 could move under these conditions

   bien gritted kent he would fight
 them with their own tactics he would
 show el corsarios silent ones as
 the great corsair had termed his tribes-
 men that he could talk to them in
 their own language thus would the
 silent ones be able to understand its
 working only he would have to be
 very careful-very very care-

   with a sudden fearsome start that

shot first icy then fiery darts of pain
through his being kent sprang upward
he had been asleep his body ached
as though it had been beaten to a pulp
by a hundred of the heaviest sledge
hammers

  how he had slept a deathlike
stupor but something had touched
him he ran his fingers over his right
ear lobe thfe ear lobe that had been
pierced with a bullet and that had been
caked with dried blood it was moist
to his touch the blood seemed to have
gone the ear was not bleeding what
was it he had felt a strange some-
thing moving at his ear strange that
had he been discovered

  was he already surrounded before
he had even had a look into corsarios
inner lair is body rigid with fear
and apprehension waiting each second
for some fated hand of death to reach
out for him through the gloom kent
stared through the wild night and lis-
tened listened with straining almost
bursting eardrums waited through the
tense silent seconds that seemed cen-
turies to endure

  the thunderous roar of the sirocco
lashing the fronds of the palms above
his head nothing else still kent
felt that strange inexplicable intuition
telling him that there was some form of
life and of danger lurking near at
hand watching him waiting its mo-
ment to spring out at him to snuff out
his life

  in those few seconds kent had years
of age added to his life he cursed
and reviled himself for  his lack of
vigilance for falling asleep right at the
door of opportunity and on the very
threshold of death

  he knew that a number of hours had
elapsed he wondered how many
suddenly he stiffened cold sweat
broke out over his tortured body with
wide eyes he tried to pierce the gloom
before him yes a low-huddled
shadow was creeping slowly through the
the legion of manana



darkness toward him he saw it clearly
now just a few feet above the top of
the ridge of his hideout closer closer
it was creeping toward him

  deftly kent reached for his pistol
simultaneously he realized almost be-
fore it was too late that it would be
a mistake to fire a shot into the night
it would announce to all of corsarios
band that trouble was at hand he
slipped his heavy gun into its holster and
grabbed his saber quietly he with-
drew it from its scabbard then the
shadow moved quickly

  kent sank back with a pent-up sigh
a dog he could see the four legs
now standing atop the ridge the
animal was staring down at him with
extended neck then he padded down
the slope of the sandy hole toward kent
came close commenced licking his
cheek

  for a second kent wondered whether
he ought not kill the animal he might
betray his presence there he won-
dered whether the dog did not have a
master near at hand it seemed good
to meet some form of life kent
stroked the shaggy back dogs were
scarce in the region tame ones even
more so it was quite evident that the
animal was not a cur he appeared to
be some species of airedale the
shoulder and leg muscles were trem-
bling quivering kent saw evidently
he had had some sort of fright or had
been running a long distance in com-
panionable burrowings the dog settled
beside kent and nestled its moist nose
into his palm after this thought
kent how can i run a saber through
his friendly heart

  after several moments of continued
silence kent became assured thatthe
dog had been out foraging alone he
had been licking kents wounded ear
he was grateful that the animal had
awakened him in his condition of ex-
treme weariness who knew but that he
might have slept right on into the bright

daylight when he would immediately
have been discovered he glanced at
his watch it was slightly after four
oclock zape he had slept from at
the least since eight the previous eve-
ning it seemed incredible but such
had been the intensity of his weariness
how much he had needed that rest
and yet how he had wasted precious
time

  quietly kent took a deep draw on
his water canteen drained it he had
one left he wished to dispose of his
first canteen so that he wouldnt be bur-
dened with it pushing it under sev-
eral clumps of jujubier bushes he buried
it deep in the sand standing to his
feet he stared off into the gloom a
number of lights blinked here and there
through the oasis even at that hour of
the morning although the place
seemed utterly deserted kent realized
that he could not be too bold corsario
was still living in a state of war there
was bound to be a sharply defined feel-
ing of tenseness and apprehension
among the tribesmen and sleep would
therefore he lighter than usual

  the heavy odors of camel dung and
living things came down on the wings
of the storm one could smell those
djicheur encampments for miles away
on the desert when the wind was right
softly kent pushed to his feet and off
among the palms holding his stout-
handled saber in his right hand his
pistol in readiness in its holster his
body tense his breath coming in short
heavy gasps kent set out to recon-
noiter the camp and to discover what
he as one man might be able to do
toward furthering the cause of his
legion and of the american girls he
expected were still held prisoners off
there by el corsario the dog who
by now had apparently become a de-
voted pal of kents trailed faithfully
close at his heels that he liked

   skirting cautiously among the trunks
of the palms at the edge of the great


the popular magazine

water hole kent made firm in his mind
of the general directions around the
place to the southward he saw a dozen
or more large oil torches flaring hori-
zontally out into the wild night wind
one thought leaped through his mind
at their sight prisoners

  the djicheur always maintained
torches over his stockaded prison camps
at night this was not the first time
that kent -had slipped unaware into a
djicheur stronghold there was that
time back in  when abdul krim
stormed the parapets at toum agoug
-but that is another story kent
peered into the black night were his
comrades there

  he hastened ahead stubbed his toe
painfully against a palm stump or root
he lurched forward almost fell recov-
ered and winced with pain steadying
himself at the wall of a small gourbi
or native hut he hesitated a moment in
silence listening there might be a
sentry within those mud walls stealth-
ily he crept around its rough surfaces
and peered within emptiness that
was good he then dropped over a
dirt ledge that marked the bank of the
water hole and slithered across on his
stomach to a row of low djicheur tents
after the style used by the bedouin at
the far end of that row a single torch
illuminated the rude trail the savage
hovels of camels hair in gruesome light
and shadow

  several hundred yards farther up the
trail he noted was the gray loom of
the abandoned blockhouse there
doubtless was where the desert chief-
tain would be in hiding he figured
but those tents he wanted to ex-
amine them came a dull snarl behind
him kent flung about angrily-his
dog he slapped the animal sharply
across the nose silence as quietly
then as a lizard he wriggled across on
his stomach to the first tent and waited
listening came heavy breathing from
within the yellow beams of the torch-

lights glimmered sickly down the age-
old paths of the oasis slowly tensely
kent lifted the camels-hair cloth at the
base of the djicheur tent wall lifted it
and peered under

  for several minutes he stared in
breathless silence as his eyes became
accustomed to the light he distinguished
four occupants two djicheur men and
two djicheur women sleeping two
long curved scimitars rested on blan-
kets near their feet softly reaching in
kent slipped them one after another
through the sand to the outside of the
tent burrowing in the sand he quietly
pawed dirt over them and buried them
from view cold perspiration poured
out over his body as he worked one
false move one misdirected motion that
should cause the slightest sound he
knew would mean his end

   slipping along then to the next tent
he proceeded with the same tactics
there were six huge warriors sleeping
in the next one and these seemed more
uneasy and sleepless than those with
the women it was with the keenest
apprehension that kent managed to
withdraw those deathly blades from the
djicheur sleeping quarters-blades that
had drawn the blood of his comrades
another stealthy burying of those long
steel weapons below the sands and kent
was slipping hand over hand with the
stealth of a desperation-driven wolf and
the keenness of a bloodhound on to
his next tent if he could only get to
that torchlighted stockade where he was
sure he would find his comrades then
he might be able to develop a wily plan
he had circling through the back of his
brain

  those legionarios of his those stout-
hearted little captains from hell were
somewhere within those shadowy
realms of the oasis he felt sure it
was not altogether the desire to cap-
ture the weapons however that drove
kent on and on from tent to tent on
that stubborn mission of his it was
the legion of manana



  the innocent lives of those american
  girls and the search for something that
  -he lifted the mouse-colored flap of
  the next djicheur tent with delicate
  trembling fingers

    this one was nearer so much nearer
  to that glaring yellow torchlight kents
  heart pounded within him like a great
  chaamba tom-tom had he seen aright 
  he had it was there that which
  he had been hoping to find the radio

    three compact metal boxes strew the
  sand against the pale yellow gleams of
  the torchlights set up ready for use
  before it on the sands however sat
  a towering djicheur his turbaned
  head was bent low over his knees his
  arms hands around his ankles sleeping
  his musket rested across his feet where
  it had apparently fallen in his slumbers

    a wave of exhilarated hope flashed
  through kents body gladdened his
  heart zape if he could only get com-
  mand of that outfit if he could just
  get his fingers onto that wireless key
  only a few seconds were all that would
  be needed to send out his position

    fired with expectancy kent dropped
   the tent wall for a moment to conjure
  his thoughts it was a set that worked
  with very little noise if he could dis-
  pose of that sleeping sentry in some
  manner he should be able to use it with-
  out waking any one aided by the
  wail of the booming sirocco and the
  rush of sand it was hardly believable
  that he would be heard

    anxiously he stared off into the hol-
  low of the oasis and beyond to the many
  torches that crackled and sputtered in
  the moaning storm through those
  dark lashing palm fronds kent caught
  a sight that brought him to stark rigid-
  ity in his tracks numberless figures
  hunched over in the gloom sitting on
  the slopes of that stockaded area
  legionarios with straining eyeballs
  kent watched the ground over those
  desolate slopes yes now and then one
  would move backs to the storm they

hunched around the hills then he
made out a high picketed fence a
regular djicheur prison stockade

  kents heart beat wildly for a mo-
ment he was torn between two thoughts
two problems should he first go over
there into that hollow of the oasis and
endeavor to free his comrade legion-
arios or should he try to recover the
radio and send a message inasmuch
as he was already on the spot with the
radio and that there was danger in mov-
ing from the place and awakening the
sentry in so doing he decided to make
a fight for the radio

  taking a fresh grip on the hilt of
his saber kent slowly dug his knees
into the sands beside the djicheur tent
and lifted once more the camels-hair
tent wall waiting for a loud and fresh
wail of the sirocco he then stealthily
pushed bodily and boldly through and
into the interior of the djicheur hovel
with a quick deft stroke he swept the
arab musket clear of the fellows feet
the djicheur startled lifted his head
from his knees drowsily simultane-
ously kent had leaped to his feet

  the djicheurs eyes suddenly wid-
ened he stiffened his lips drew back
into a snarl at that second kents
legion saber with agile swiftness
flashed through the gloom there came
a burst of crimson blood at the throat
of the dazed desert brigand with a
muffled gurgle the huge form toppled
to one side kent in one lightninglike
bound leaped atop it smothered the
form in the loose folds of the fellows
djeelaba so that there would be no fur-
ther sound

  in a thrice kent had slipped across
to the radio dropped back the cover
that encompassed the sending key
thrown the tiny switch and was fever-
ishly tapping out the legion call letters
in dots and dashes listening with a
desperate fervor he sought to reach his
ait ahmed post and between times
catch the first warning note of any ap-


the popular magazine

proaching danger outside the tent that
might lead to his discovery then his
face lighted with a great joy

  he pressed the ear phones closely
down over his ears and held them tighter
to the sides of his temples his heart
throbbed and pounded deep down within
him as he listened through that lonely
african night then there came the
strange plaintive tunes of the wireless
waves of dots and dashes excitedly
kent leaned over toward the muscular
airedale before him

  coraje he whispered earnestly
we have them old fellow

  it was too good to be true he had
gotten through he had obtained his
o k to proceed sending those never-
sleeping legionarios at ait ahmed were
on the job-they were always on the
job through the thunderous boom of
the storm sweat poring out over his
tired body kent bore down on his
delicate key with the rapid message

comandante cordoba

    l e post 

        ait ahmed

   this is kent at el ougadir oasis el cor-
sario is here with captured caravan party and
over seventy-five legion prisoners rush
help as-

  suddenly kents fingers stiffened on
the wireless key he stared toward his
dog that had sprung to his feet had
he seen the tent wall behind kent move 
the airedale lips drawn back over his
teeth was slithering across the sands
on his stomach toward a definite spot
of the tent wall as quick as a tiger
kent grabbed his saber whirled for the
tent wall and thrust his head outside

  a long dark shadow met his eyes
the shadow was just lifting the tent
wall to kents extreme left at the spot
he had just abandoned a long
djicheur musket barrel was just easing
under that thin sheet of camels hair
there came a sudden flash of bright
steel in the dark kent had leaped

  crash the djicheur startled

pulled the trigger of his rifle kent
would have given anything to have pre-
vented that lone shot but it was too
late now	

  again and again kent drove his
saber through the struggling djicheur
that had striven to take his life the
desert gypsy lurched forward to kent
who caught him in his arms and eased
him quietly to the sand then with
sweat-slippery hands he dragged his
attacker quickly within the tent

  that done he waited in breathless
silence for further trouble that he ex-
pected no movement no noises ex-
cept for the roar of the storm reach-
ing out kent patted the head of his
dog affectionately it had been a close
call too close for comfort and he well
realized that the animal had saved his
life

  there was no doubt in kents mind
however that the shot must have been
heard by some in that djicheur strong-
hold he would have to be on his
guard more than ever now bending
low over the still form of his tribal
marauder he slipped the scimitar cord
from his neck and lifted the long blade
clear

  picking up the fellows musket he
wrapped it in his bournouse and tucked
it under his arm then he hustled out
the tent once outside he buried the
rifle and scimitar at the rear of the
tent in the same manner as he had
done with the others

  in perplexity kent hesitated a mo-
ment to gather his wits beyond the
line of palms down in the hollow those
torches continued their lurid flarings
he must hasten there and see if he had
been correct in his surmise that his
legion companeros were in that region
of the oasis slipping along on his
hands and knees he peered over a dirt
ledge of some six feet height and looked
down darkness he slid his heels
over the ridge and dropped

  he landed and on the instant was
the legion of manana



thrown to his feet pandemonium
heaved around him he felt life on all
sides two crushing pressures rolled
his sides the whole earth seemed
achurn moving there was a peculiar
animal smell around him his hand
flung out caught at something warm
and shaggy camels dromedaries
he had unwittingly dropped onto a nest
of them

  struggling to his feet he pushed and
shoved them about until he was once
more in a clearing disturbed and
startled the animals rushed this way
and that snarling and shoving kents
dog yelped several times kent cursed
leaping behind a palm trunk he flat-
tened himself in the shadows and
waited listening for any further signs
of unwanted life

  would he ever get clear of that death
hole he asked himself would he ever
be able to do anything that would aid
the freedom of the caravan party and
his comrades the outlook appeared
black weh at least he had gotten
most of his message off to his coman-
dante he was never more grateful for
anything in his life

  that had been one real break of good
fortune all was not lost yet per-
haps-easing along the lower embank-
ment he reached the region of the burn-
ing torches resting for a second be-
hind a high jujubier bush he stared out
and studied the spot that he thought im-
prisoned his legion comrades

  a stake fence some twelve feet in
height met his gaze- on its corners and
along its upper ledges flared the torches
as he moved nearer he could distinguish
the pale khaki of the legion uniforms
his legionarios his lost comrades
none other his heart went out to
those brave fighters within that stock-
ade-awaiting the hour when the roar-
ing sirocco should pass and the djicheur
corsair could proceed with his torture
pastimes could he ever reach that
fence undetected where were the sen-

tries no one was in sight was it
possible that they had merely left their
prisoners there unguarded locked in
during the storm

  suddenly a shadow emerged at the
northern end of the stockade kent
jerked to rigidity a sentry yes
his back to the storm his white
djeelaba robe whipping out around him
black carbine over his shoulder he
looked slowly through the dark about
him in a moment he had disappeared
on his patrol lost in the shadows kent
counted the minutes that the fellow had
been gone before he returned to view
it had been approximately two minutes
when he turned again into the shadows
kent told himself that he must try to
gain the stockade gate how was he
to do it

  if he darted toward those stockade
walls full in the light he might be seen
from other sources would he have
time to do any work before the sentry
returned again he believed he would
reduce hazard by crawling along on his
stomach slipping down kent com-
menced rapidly wriggling like the
silent ones across the sands toward
that great entryway leading to his com-
rades his faithful dog crouched
knowingly along beside him body taut
with nervous tension kent reached the
wicket gate and flattened himself at
its base waiting for the sentry to pass

  as the dark shadow circled the cor-
ners and then passed fronu-view kent
slipped his hands upward and felt over
the heavy lashings that held the great
gate true to djicheur custom it had
been securely bound with numberless
leather thongs drawing out his saber
kent slashed as quietly as possible
through the tight wrappings there
came a giving of the wall the gate fell
away slightly once more kent dropped
to his knees and waited at the next
turning of the sentry he pushed the
great wicket gate slowly back and-
wriggled through

  within he stared around him there
was his gang dozens of them in
low helpless and hopeless positions and
groups they slept in the storm glad-
ness radiated kents being as he realized
he was going to be able to free these
brave hearts under those lonely skies
hope gleamed ahead the sirocco
howled and screamed in eerie louder
wail over head night of a night
thought kent what would happen to
them crawling along he slipped up
to the nearest legionario it was emer-
son a tough little canadian known in
the outfit as el canuk

  shoving a hand quietly over the
canadians mouth kent held it there
while his companion raised upward in
startled movement to a sitting posture
wide of eye the legionario peered
through the wild night then he drew
back as though he had seen a ghost a
queer incredible phantom catching
his breath in a sharp sibilation he then
leaned forward and gazed deeply into
kents face

  teniente he breathed in unbeliev-
able astonishment you a prisoner
too

  kent shook his head negatively

  no silencio im going to try
to get you all out of here but quiet
our freedom depends on it help me
gather together the others

  in rapt and awesome incredulity the
face of the legionaire lighted with sud-
den understanding kent bent over him
and whispered

  vaya pronto rouse the others
hurry

  si

  as stealthily as desperate wild cats
kent and emerson wriggled among
their fighting comrades and softly
pressed them together in a shadowy cor-
ner of the stockade one by pne those
grim fighters gripped hands with their
beloved officer and leader and their
rescuer their devotion and new hope
brought a thick lump in kents throat

if there were any braver or more loyal
fighting men in the world then kent
wanted to have them shown him he
doubted that there could be

chapter vii

escape

in a few words he told them of the
scimitars and rifles buried in the
sands at the rear of the djicheur tents
they were to get them as covertly as
possible and steal along after him into
the great blockhouse where el corsario
was certain to be holding the caravan
party and making his headquarters
there they would do everything pos-
sible to rescue the civilian party and
then if possible get dromedaries and
escape into the sahara after that they
would work their way back to toum
agoug en route they would hope to
meet up with some scouting parties

  bueno whispered kent as he
looked around the band of his tough
hearts assembled beside him now
on your bellies ive seen one sentry at
the northern end weve got to get him
muzzle him no noise not a sound
smother the sentry then on to the
djicheur tents

  the legionarios nodded grimly like
saharan lizards in single file they
wormed their way along through the
sands of the stockade then softly out
the narrow opening of the prison gate
close along the outer walls of the
prison camp on and on toward the un-
suspecting sentry they moved at the
northern corner of the wall the legion-
arios waited

  the soft padding of bare djicheur
feet in sand reached nearer the
legionarios tensed for their spring
suddenly the white-robed figure a
towering djicheur nothing under seven
feet in height his flowing djeelaba
whipping out in the wind before him
staggered backward and stared white
of face
the legion of manana



  in stark terror he glared at that
strange apparition that crawled along
the fence pickets at his feet the hor-
ror on his face might have been fear
of the legionario or it might have been
from fear of the punishment that would
be meted out to him by el corsario
when it had been discovered that his
prisoners had escaped

  as he staggered backward he flung
his musket high above his head and
tried to bring it down in some sort of
defense he was too slow for the six
strong-armed legionarios that leaped
through the dark for his sun-bronzed
muscular throat

  fired with hatred and thirsting for
revenge those tough-hearted ones thun-
dered to the ground with their white-
robed djicheur hands clapped like
vises over the sun-parched lips that
struggled to scream for help in soft
thumpings deep grunts and groans all
muffled in the roar of the howling si-
rocco the group of fighting legionarios
silenced their hated enemy quickly and
as quickly dispatched his soul to allah

  the job done the legionarios stood
to their feet quietly kent waved his
arm over his head in signal for the men
to follow him toward the buried
weapons up the sand ridges and
around the hollow containing the drome-
daries he led his silent-footed ones
toward the djicheur hovels pointing
to the hollow he whispered

  down there are dromedaries when
we finish our job thats where well get
transportation

  for a moment he hesitated on the
ridge holding his men beside him for
the sake of secrecy kent figured that
it would be wisest for him to try to ap-
proach the great blockhouse alone or
with one man

  listen brave ones he counseled
el canuk and myself will go to recon-
noiter corsarios blockhouse close in
in silence on these djicheur tents
secure the weapons dispose of the

djicheurs m those tents give canuk
and myself time to get to the block-
house and inside before you go to
work on these slumbering djicheurs
too otherwise we may all be trapped
bien we go

  the legionarios nodded kent took
the heavy scimitar held by rodriguez a
tall basque that had been captured
from the stockade sea try and passed it
to emerson then he beckoned the
canadian to follow him

  you know the entrance to the block-
house questioned kent

  si senor

  bueno  lead the way

  as kent slipped past his legionarios
they gripped his hands his shoulder or
his arm to wish him luck in a mo-
ment the shadows had separated them
fired with fresh enthusiasm kent
strode vigorously through the wind-
torn shadows of that desolate outpost
with his comrade as they hurried
quietly through the hollow containing
the dromedaries kent recognized that
there wafc a large group of them to
emerson he whispered

  there are many in corsarios band
now 

 si amigo many too many
there were more than three hundred
strange tribesmen waiting for corsario
at the oasis when we were herded in
here last night it is said that corsario
has sent messengers all through the
atlas and the sahara for the tribesmen
to join him on a great war against the
spanish he thinks himself a second
abdul krim teniente and that this war
will be even larger and more successful
than was the last uprising when they
have whipped the spanish-when-then
they plan to sweep on into french
morocco and french algeria and wipe
up the french legion several hun-
dred more tribesmen are expected by
dawn or before but the sirocco will

delay-

  a series of shadows darted across


the popular magazine

their path the two men leaped back
and flattened against the palm trunks
a half a dozen or more wild arab dogs
streaked past them startled in the night
again proceeding along the two com-
rades reached the wide hill on which
stood the great abandoned blockhouse
wind-swept and open to the stars to
the eastward kent noted faint streaks
of crimson tinting the skies soon full
daylight would be upon them

  as kent looked toward the eastern
fringes of the shadowy oasis a trem-
bling went through his body dotting
the sand in gray and black indistinct
shadows seemingly hundreds on hun-
dreds of those low djicheur tents
marked the early-morning sands of the
camp the sirocco was fast dying to a
normal wind with the rising of the
sun it was probable that the desert
would emerge windless and silent then
there would come pouring in from all
points of the compass the gypsy blood-
seeking tribes to swell el corsarios
murderous ranks speed meant the
freedom and safety of all kent felt
a strong pressure gripping his arm
emerson was attracting his attention to
a row of jujubier bushes that defined
the trail leading to the blockhouse

  ahi he whispered hoarsely
there is the only protected entrance
to corsarios stronghold

  kent nodded silently he took the
lead up the crude path a mud wall
some eight feet high met them at the
end of the trail a strong metal gate
blocked their further passage kent ex-
amined it closely it was securely fas-
tened from the inside he leaned over
emerson

  venga we must climb the wall
boost me over

  in quick deft movements kent
wormed over the wall hung on his
stomach on the ledge and pulled his
comrade up after him

   together on the opposite side they
slid to the soft sands skirting the

walls of the blockhouse they reached the
rear of the place a dirt floor revealed
an open kitchen several large iron
pots were steaming over two fires built
on the sand some one was walking
within the second back room of the
old legion garrison breakfast was be-
ing prepared kent pushed his com-
rade down low to the ground on their
hands and knees desert style they crept
toward those sounding footsteps that
moved around the pots and pans

  around the corners of that crumbling
wall kent bent low like a crouched
lynx waiting to spring at his prey two
bronzed bare legs stepped down from
the inner floor of the kitchen to the
sands like a whiplash kents strong
arms sped out and grappled those bony
djicheur feet dull thud the cook
crashed to the floor in quick legion-
ario thrust emerson plunged the
djicheur scimitar into that startled bat-
tling boumouse there was not a gasp
not a gurgle so sudden and so positive
had been the charge together the
two legionarios drew the cook outward
from the kitchen and pushed him
through the sand and around the cor-
ners of the blockhouse out of sight

  returning the two men their faith-
ful dog between them hastened through
the rear room and on into the great
rambling blockhouse an expansive
eating room then a series of smaller
rooms in which there were caravan
lashings thongs rifles and bandoliers
of ammunition and camel trappings
with an agile reach emerson bent over
grabbed a high-powered mauser rifle
a belt of ammunition and stepped in
hurriedly behind kent down a long
silent corridor the two moved fully ex-
pecting to be pounced upon from some
unseen angle at any moment

  the dog kent saw had now taken
the lead and was standing at the en-
trance of a high doorway over which
hung a long tapestry swaying in th
dying gusts of the mad sirocco the

pop-b
the legion of manana



airedale stared up at kent with wistful
pleading eyes as if to say wont you
look in here  kent trusted the animals
senses on tiptoes anxiously he
reached the entryway drew back the
tapestry hanging and peered inside
his face paled as he stared within
there were at least a dozen djicheur
women sleeping in a circle on a camels-
hair mat on the floor in the center of
that circle lay two white girls kent
instantly recognized the blond hair of
the captured american girl

  kent thought hard and fast it was
strange those girls there safe even
though kent knew that the desert tribes-
men were not particularly desirous of
white women that they were so care-
fully kept was odd there was only
one answer to the enigma ransom

  how could he ever attract the atten-
tion of those two white girls and get
them out of the room without disturb-
ing the others it didnt seem humanly
possible yet kent told himself that it
would have to be done in some way
he whispered into emersons ear

  stay here guard the door

  emerson nodded kent his saber
held in his hand with a viselike grip
tiptoed with catlike steps across the
floor it was the one most crucial mo-
ment of his life and well did he realize
it all-everything-depended on not
waking any of those half-witted
djicheur women perspiring with ap-
prehension kent crept around the sleep-
ing tribal women within the circle he
bent over the blond-haired american
girl pressed his fingers gently to her
lips then he pressed harder

  with a sharp start the girl rose to
her knees fear and horror written on
her face but she did not cry out as
she stared from that pretty face as
white as a linen sheet she sank over
then crumpled to the floor in a dead
faint kent steadied her tried to pre-
vent her from dropping with a noisy
thump that was bad

 pop-b

  reaching over he then proceeded to
rouse the second american girl a thin
sibilated intake of breath half a gurgle
half a thin scream pierced the air she
scrambled to her knees and lurched back
with quaking tremors staring at the
legionario as though she were looking
into the face of a dead one with
wild hysterical shufflings the djicheur
women were astir a sharp shriek cut
through the room from one of the
djicheur women on seeing kent and his
legion uniform one and all the
women were scrambling to their frantic
feet

  in one desperate leap kent bent over
gathered the blond-haired girl into his
arms and staggered backward to the
second american girl he yelled

  quick for your life follow me

  bounding for the entry way kent
reeled out of the room while a dozen
angry hands strong and clawing ripped
into the girl he was carrying jerked at
his clothing and pulled the clothing
from the limp body of the young woman
in an effort to prevent her release
screams and inhuman bestial howls
clattered down the air

  to emerson he shouted roughly
get that other american kid if you
can beat off these she-wolves help
me

  back you scum back howled
emerson as he ripped into the djicheur
women with threatening scimitar

  the angry legionario stormed
through the mob of women and grap-
pled the american girl by the wrists
literally tore her from her captors the
blockhouse though was now fairly
afire with wild shouts angry disturbed
slumberers racing footfalls and bang-
ing doors fierce commands were
echoing through the halls

  beating his way to the kitchen door
kent reached the exit once there he
saw a dozen or more huge djicheur
warriors tearing up to the rear of the
blockhouse a door crashed open be-


the popular magazine

fore him bounding into the room
scimitar in hand plunged a towering
figure a fierce grimace on his face

  el corsario

  quick as forked lightning kents 
jerked upward from his hip his gray
eyes snapping fire his broad supple
shoulders squared before the door be-
hind him he covered the white figure
of el corsario

  move just once pleaded kent
and ill drill your black heart you
white-bellied rat

  corsario staggered backward before
that ominous blue barrel and the cold
gray eyes that gleamed behind it sud-
denly from either side of the desert
chieftain protruded two blued mauser
carbines white-turbaned heads of
djicheurs loomed above them bronzed
faces staring at kent threateningly
straight toward the hearts of the
american girl and kent those deathly
weapons pointed crouching fearfully
beside them emerson and the second
american girl waited not daring to
move a muscle

  kent fingered the trigger of his 
he longed to pull that trigger and send
the shell flying on its way that he knew
would bring an end to the worst of all
the bloody corsairs of the vast sahara
after his long struggle kent had his
great prize covered and cornered yet he
feared to fire just as he had out there
on the wide desierto once more the
great corsario had him balked to
open fire would bring instant death to
the innocent civilians beside him and
beyond doubt to himself that kent
knew

  was all lost after that tortuous battle
to reach the side of the doomed civil-
ians where were his legionarios as
if in answer to his question he heard
a number of shots fired somewhere out-
side the blockhouse why didnt those
legionarios come  a deathly silence
fell over the tense group the atmos-
phere was as heavy as that super-

charged with electricity before a sum-
mer thunderstorm faintly then there
came a slight rustle behind kent the
blond girl at his side suddenly pointed
over his shoulder then she screamed
the chilling terror-stricken cry shat-
tered the taut air like a hurled bomb-
shell looking back kent whirled to
face the unseen danger behind him

chapter viii

butchy again

instinctively kent felt rather

  than saw that he was cornered
trapped like a flash he remembered
those djicheurs he had seen approach-
ing from the rear of the blockhouse
he sprang back and ducked-jump
and look afterward-that was the
motto of a legionario as he whirled
kent came face to face with a tall lean
djicheur swinging the black butt of a
rifle over his skull

  kent fired at the same instant the
heavy carbine struck his shoulder a
cracking blow and slithered down his
arm the crash of kents  shook
the small room blue acrid smoke filled
the air the tall djicheur gave a sav-
age scream of pain grabbed his ab-
domen and crumpled to the floor an-
other shadowy carbine flew up kents
pistol went flying from his hand it
whirled through the room and struck a
table at the far side hoarse shouts
the shrill scream of women filled the
air

  a dozen forms it seemed to kent
rushed suddenly through that kitchen
exit toward him djicheur and bed-
ouin arms swept around him-literally
smothered him- leaping into the air
flailing out with powerful arms kent
battered into those white djeelaba bodies
that crushed around him chins shot
back bones cracked and fists thudded
against fists in a moment however
kent his face lacerated blood trickling
from his mouth and eyes found him-
the legion of manana



self unable to move an arm or foot
groaning for breath sweat pouring
from his aching fire-hot body he was
flung to the floor heavy knees bore
down on his chest he felt his ribs would
snap with the strain his hands and
arms were pinned to his sides it was
useless now to try to struggle

  vaguely he saw the two white girls
being rushed from the room the
black-robed women were escorting
them his heart went out to them
would they ever get out alive kent
wondered a steel scimitar flashed
through the air in a heavy commotion
at his right emerson was putting up
a tough fight then kent saw a crim-
son stain on that scimitar blade

  heard emerson cry out it was his
end kent cursed the djicheur wildly
strong leather thongs were being
passed around his wrists and ankles
the rifle firing outside the blockhouse
he heard had stopped all was silent
what had happened had his com-
rades all been captured again why
didnt they come to his aid

  hopelessness and anger flaming
through his mind kent stared up with
bleary bloodshot eyes el corsario
bent over him a cynical grimace over-
spreading his black moslem eyes that
stared at kent with burning eastern
hatred

  hah-hah my early-morning caller
word of a yankee eh the american
unbeliever would keep his promise eh
you a giaour would outwit el cor-
sario eh

  yes spat kent vengefully

  para shouted corsario menacingly
i do not make war on women nor
old men-as you shall see if i decide to
spare your infidel life-but on your
puffy-chested legionarios of spain i
and my silent ones will bring you of
the legion to your knees that means
war and war means time and money
of time allah sends plenty also pris-
oners prisoners some of them bring

ransom the americans of the rich
ruby mines will pay plenty to el cor-
sario to regain their wives and sweet-
hearts i think no

  not a cent barked kent the
legion will return them yet have no
fear

  fear laughed corsario of the
infidel legionario hah-hah for a
brief moment the great desert corsair
stared down at kent thoughtfully
you braved the sirocco eh by the
spirit of mohammed you are a fearless
one-for an infidel

  as though that ended all corsario
swung to his sentries gave rough com-
mands in arabic bending over him
several of the djicheurs picked up kent
by his arms and legs and swept through
the door with him toward the front of
the house and dank dark corridors as
kent was carried out corsario flung
after him

  now we shall see how brave you
are

  through the kitchen room around to
the left of the blockhouse walls and
down a crumbling stairway kent was
jostled and jolted his shoulders fre-
quently striking the corners of the
rough walls with paining crashes on
and on through what seemed an inter-
minable length of those dank under-
ground corridors he was carried until
they came to a heavy iron door here
the leader pushed back the huge gate
and the little band entered a yellow
torchlight threw its sickly rays around
the rude room between the flapping
djeelabas that carried him kent saw
numberless legion machine guns stand-
ing on the dirt floor

  in the center of the room was a table
some ten feet in length a great table
which in former times had probably
served officers of the legion espanol
but now worm-eaten and crumbled with
age its massive legs jutted almost an-
gularly into the soft dirt floor of the
abandoned blockhouse


the popular magazine

  with a hard thump the djicheurs
dropped kent onto a packing case at
one side of the room then they
jerked him up to sitting posture and
leaned him against the wall then kent
stared-stared again as though he
couldnt trust his eyes for the sight he
saw

  sitting cross-legged atop a machine-
gun tripod was-butchy

  butchy you gasped kent in-
credulously

  from the evil sneer on the sergeants
face kent realized the black treachery
that had been working within their own
ranks back there in ait ahmed in a
flood of memory the events swept before
his startled mind those machine guns
stolen from their camp that night at
toum agoug the bullet fired behind
his back over the parapets when they
had fought the djicheur that scarlet
night the missing radio how it had
been discovered all set up

  you do not seem happy to meet your
old sargento amigo barked butchy
ironically justice at last

chapter ix

the renegade

the great iron door swung back and
in entered the massive figure of el
corsario there was steelly glint in his
black eyes as he overheard the words

  justice rasped kent in desperation
justice eh why you-you traitorous
snake you carrion

  hijo de perro snarled butchy
you wont get away with that

  the russian short heavy-set and
powerful drove like an arrow across
the shadowy room for kent fairly
shaking with rage he swung out with
his hairy fists with crashes they re-
sounded against kents jaws and cheeks
kent felt the hot blood surging through
his veins his teeth rattled and white
hot lights danced before his eyes he

struggled wildly to get to his feet to
defend himself

  you swine you coward hit a
man when hes tied eh thats your
stamp a brave jackal heart of a
louse

  in maddened frenzy butchys hand
dropped toward his hip where hung his


  ill get you for-

  mouharrem thundered a booming
voice stop

  kent lifted his throbbing head the
huge figure of el corsario loomed men-
acingly toward butchy from across the
room his arms folded across his
barrellike chest and white robes he
glared at the sergeant angrily

  is this the way you carry out my
orders he demanded zevale igh-
tiar idiot

  butchy stepped back slowly sullenly
deprived of his revenge he was afire
with hatred corsario with a grandilo-
quent sweep of his arm waved the re-
mainder of the warriors from the room
the door creaked to almost silently and
left the three men alone in the under-
ground room of the desolate blockhouse
el corsario his curved scimitar clank-
ing metallically at his side walked up
to kent drawing up his broad blade
he ripped loose the thongs that held
kents hands there was an easy con-
fidence in his muscular movements

  the great corsair had not commanded
hundreds of tribesmen and wild ob-
streperous characters for years not to
understand human nature he leaned
back casually against the shadowy walls
and surveyed his prisoner

  if you have the understanding of
a camel he said in a low cool voice
you will see that you are helpless to
kick against the scimitars of an army
if you will use your infidel brains and
your yankee wit you may yet save
your foolish life from now on-for
the rest of your days-you shall be my
prisoner that is you may if the

privilege should you choose or you
may choose-death i have not time
to barter with fools if you will aid
sahib butchy to instruct my men in
machine gunnery i will grant you your
freedom further i see you have cour-
age i will make you a cherif a leader
among my famous hard-hitting desert
jackals

  corsario hunched his djeelaba over
his shoulder angularly and twisted the
glowing end of a cigarette between
quiet composed fingers

  you will have the admiration of el
corsario the freedom of the great
sahara a splendid arabian horse to
ride-with time and good behavior
in time you may even become a great
desert chieftain like-el corsario in-
stead of a nameless one a hireling of
spain

  with shrewd analytical eyes the great
djicheur was studying the face of the
prisoner before him he stood erect
and tall moving back from the wall
he crossed his arms again over his mas-
sive chest and waited for his answer
he was becoming impatient

  mash-allah he barked savagely
choose will you or will you not
become one of my trusted men yes
or no

  the blood raced through kents brain
if he accepted corsarios offer would
he have a chance to escape to rescue
the american women he ground his
teeth bewilderedly little by little he
was regaining his breath his composure
his body throbbed with a thousand
aches yet he seemed not to know them
so heavy was the pressure of his mental
problems as he stared at butchy
savage hatred leaped through his veins
he a teniente of the legion espafiol
to become one of butchys class-a trai-
tor a desert vandal an enemy of the
legion the dead faces of his com-
rades floated before his tired vision
rivas-ligne-they seemed to challenge
nim it would doubtless mean torture if

  he refused he knew he could depend
on that

  speak infidel snapped corsario
viciously angered at kents slowness to
reply

  the word of a yanqui answered
kent coldly never changes i have
given my word of honor to spain i
am a legionario before i become one
of your bloody pack of women-torturers
and robbing vandals i will die on the
rack before i become a yellow-bellied
traitor like this poison-hearted snake
butchy i would die a hundred deaths
go your foul limit but by the word
of a yanqui i swear you will pay

  you are a fool infidel you are
hardly in a position to threaten corsario
fools go to the tortures as you have
perhaps guessed you have chosen
i have no time for fools angrily
the great corsair swung toward butchy
call the-

  a khaki figure ankles bound
hurtled through the shadows straight
for the feet of the desert chieftain leaped
kent as fast corsario had whipped
out his flashing scimitar with a snarl
butchy jerked up his  corsario
crashed down on the upfiinging hand
of butchy with his broad blade crash
blue smoke filled the room hot lead
whistled past kents brain the action
caught his breath corsario had saved
his life the pistol fell to the dirt
the three men converged toward it in
a struggling knot

  writhing in his ankle bonds kent
toppled to his knees and fell across the
fallen  jerked over it with his hands
clutched it in an agile roll he stag-
gered to his knees on the dirt floor
of the cellar room in a desperation-
riven jerk he swept the heavy pistol
over butchy and corsario

  you djicheur imbecile growled
butchy to corsario what do you
mean what have you done

trembling with stark apprehension
kent wriggled backward from his tor-

mentors slowly his two enemies eased
toward him

  back you loco hyenas blazed
kent warningly or ill blast your
souls to hell

  the two held their steps glaring
watching for a seconds opportunity to
spring forwardat kents throat

  blood of my life he flamed breath-
lessly torture is it by the word of
a yanqiri now we shall see he
shook himself muscularly like an im-
prisoned dog suddenly released from
its leash and worked his aching shoul-
der back and forth to prevent it going
stiff pick up those lashings he com-
manded then to corsario he ordered
bind that two-legged beast with the
soul of a lisdrd beside you and bind
him fast and tight he swept his cap-
tured legion  over the pair one
false move and ill speed both your
souls to allah or wherever you desert
vermin go now choose he spat mock-
ingly

  the desert leader bound butchy and
bound him well while kent stood over
them his  resting lightly on its trig-
ger over his delicate finger

  if you think youll get away with
this wise one blazed butchy youve
got another think coming this will
cost you your life all right as soon
as a few of the tribesmen arrive hah-
hah  he sneered derisively the wise
yanqui eh

  shut up you yellow snake
snapped kent another word out of
you and youll go east right now
came a heavy pounding at the door
kent hobbled up behind corsario
prodded the hr figure in the ribs with
the heavy muzzle of his pistol forced
him to sit atop the long table in the
center of the room 

  now listen you he commanded
roughly theres death waiting impa-
tiently for you right here at your mos-
lem elbow just one pull on this small
trigger and-death to corsario and

  therell be a cartridge left for me
you areno fool corsario do as i
command-until you think you have a
chance to outwit me

  kent could see the bronzed neck
muscles of the towering djicheur work-
ing in pent-up anger the hot blood
pounding through his empurpling
cheeks and neck veins distended the
door flung back in rushed two bulk-
ing djicheurs kent stood well covered
behind the wide-robed corsair

  tell them spat kent vitreously
to leave their firearms inside the door
and to bring in the american women
once more he jabbed the hard muzzle
of his  remindingly against corsarios
ribs in terse arabic el corsario gave
the commands the two sentries in
flustered bewilderment rested their car-
bines against the wall near the door and
bowed from the room as soon as
they had gone kent hobbled backward
toward the firearms and with his left
hand carried them to a spot of hiding
behind the packing case with the
sharpness of a caged wolf the great
djicheur watched his captor

  footsteps were sounding down the
long corridor womens plaintive
voices came to kents weary ears made
his taut muscles even tauter with anxi-
ety for their safety in a second the
door swung back and the two american
girls their faces as pale as white marble
swayed weakly into the room

  stand to one side there spoke kent
with cool voice

  the women with trembling fright
hurried to one side of the doorway
kent moved closer to corsario

  now send one of your silent ones
to bring in a goodly bunch of leather
lashings the other will bring five of
my legionarios

  kent saw corsario stiffen well he
knew that those lashings were to be
used on himself he hesitated stub-
bornly viciously kent jabbed the
massive figure in the ribs again
the legion of manana



  dont be a fool he whispered
or remember its death

  slowly sullenly the commands were
given the two sentries their faces
staring perplexedly disappeared into the
dark exit when they had left kent
turned toward corsario

  those tall fine-looking ones they
ae thy brothers

  sons rasped corsario with the
talemapnd courage that an infidel could
never understand

  kent nodded and smiled a grim
philosophic smile jjien he looked away
thoughtfully his wy mind was work-
ing like a compressed-air trip hammer

  listen you of royal desert blood
when your first son returns you will tell
him this - that you have made me your
cherif and your personal aid that
there will soon be a great battle with
the legion espanol and mark this
well o father of talented ones that
in the event you are not available that
he and all the other sheikhs will take

orders from me if-

  a babble of raucous voices and growls
rattled down the corridors the door
pushed back and five husky legionarios
tightly bound were pushed rudely into
the dark shadows of the room on sight
of the khaki-clad legionarios cor-
sarios body seemed to wilt his great
frame to sag with utter hopelessness
corsarios elder son was the first of the
two to return

  speak to your son give him the
orders commanded kent

  never growled corsario sullen
and obstinate he sat on the great table
facing the doorway with kent behind
him

  the sheikh looked at his father
searchingly his scimitar clanking at his
side awaiting command from his father
and chief

  speak barked kent viciously

before i-

  with the speed of light the huge
form of corsario drove backward from

the smooth surface of the wide table
kent fired the heavy crash of the 
vibrated like a cannon shot through the
underground room corsario staggered
back his face white with fear and pur-
ple with moslem hatred he reached
desperately for his paining thigh

  next time i fire higher warned
kent and nearer the heart

  at the same instant however there
was a flash of steel through that dark-
ened room the sheikh and son of
corsario had sprang with a wicked
lunge at kent leaping back kent
covered that obstreperous youth before
he could get into dangerous action
holding them rigidly before him kent
called out to the american girls

  one of you girls come over here
quick

   the blond one responded breathless
and frightened but nonetheless active

  pick up that scimitar-that knife-
there please

   the girl stooped over recovered the
scimitar

  now get behind me cut those
leather lashings around my ankles be
fast

  working with straining fingers the
girl soon cut through the leather thongs
that held kents feet she stood to her
feet

  now hurry over there to those
legionarios and cut their lashings all
of them just as fast as you can

  in a moment while kent covered the
two djicheurs the girl had freed the
legionarios their hollow gaunt faces
however showed kent only too well
that they were suffering with hunger
and thirst they scrambled hurriedly
about and faced kent

   in that far corner indicated kent
are two rifles get them you win-
ston and francisco cover these two
djicheurs and watch them like falcons
they are no ordinary prisoners they
will leap at you in a flash if you relax
a muscle

  si teniente

  the legionarios obtained the carbines
and were covering the two desert van-
dals frantically kent foraged over
the room keeping one wary eye on his
two prisoners no thongs long enough
were visible he called to his legion-
arios

  lets have a couple of your leather
belts there quick

  the belts were withdrawn from
pants and handed across kent tossed
them to winston

  bind that young sheikhs wrists and
ankles make it fast por dios an-
other sheikh will be here any second

  working feverishly the lanky austra-
lian bound corsarios son hand and
foot

  now get him behind that packing
case out of sight commanded kent
quick

  grunting and struggling the legion-
arios pushed their prisoner into the dirt
corner as ordered desperate kent
stared around him what could he do
corsarios second son was coming he
could hear the footfalls down the hall-
way now to corsario he said

  now back up onto that table face
the door and another false move out
of you like that last one and ill drill
you right through the heart word of
a yanqui this time it will mean your
death

  corsario face as pale as milk slunk
limpingly across to the table top and
sat down on it as he walked to his
post behind corsario kent called to his
comrades

  now each man of you get off there
into that dark corner cross your hands
as though you were still bound face
the wall not a move out of you unless
i call get those two rifles over there
too against the wall out of sight some
place

  in speedy quiet shuffle the legion-
arios darted into the corner as directed
and were almost lost to view among

the shadows kent covered himself
just behind corsario as the great door
opened and the younger son of cor-
sario stepped into the room a bunch
of leather thongs hung across his arm

  speak whispered kent gruffly
speak before i dispatch your soul to
allah and my nameless ones send your
son along with you

  slowly the great desert chieftain
spoke

  my son i am ill there was a
strange almost pitiful timbre to the
voice  i have made this brave one
a cherif of the djicheurs he will do
our every bidding there will soon be
a battle with the legion should any-
thing happen that you cannot obtain or-
ders from me then you will carry out
his commands

  the heavy form of corsario drooped
with shame and sorrow

  that is all whispered kent send
him away tell him to report in a half
hour

  the order was repeated the young
sheikh stared bewilderedly across the
room to where the legion prisoners
faced the wall apparently bound then
he gazed back at the two women who
now sat on the dirt floor watching the
curious drama being enacted there be-
fore them the tall sheikh dropped his
thongs to the ground then with a
wide courteous salaam to his father
bowed from the room

  the djicheurs footfalls echoed down
the corridor as kent barked to his com-
rades 

  fast my brave ones get those
leather lashings bind this chief
kent backed off still covering corsario
the great desert leader however
seemed to have lost all his strength all
his usual virile spirit with drooped
shoulders and limply hanging arms he
accepted the lashings that were draw-
ing his arms to the tightness of steel
bands as though he were a child being
punished his white hair hung di-
the legion of manana



sheveled over his thick eyebrows and
his eyes stared dreamily away as he
seemed to dream visions in another land
kent jerked his big australian legion-
ario by the elbow and pointed to cor-
sario

  search him he commanded

  speedily the legionario threw back the
great djeelaba robe its interior lined
with shimmering blue silk with
rapid-moving hands he explored all
around the body of the great djicheur
kaid through the spacious pockets and
about the belt reaching onto a heavy-
braided scimitar cord he drew up its
end a round heavy chamois bag was
suspended at its base the trooper
jerked the cord free and tossed the bag
to kent opening it he ran his fingers
down inside the soft chamois skin his
fingers slipped through dozens of
smoothly polished red stones

  rubies big as hens eggs a for-
tune here loot from the caravans
eh big boy

  deftly kent thrust the heavy sack
inside his tunic in a moment the
legionarios had bound the lengthy form
of the desert leader until he could not
move hand arm leg or foot care-
fully then kent had the same and even
more efficient job done with corsarios
elder son he next turned to the
women it was reaching he realized
high noon time was drawing short
the long files of the legion forces un-
der cordoba he figured must be wind-
ing their way closer to el ougadir and
those ominous tribal masses that seethed
ever larger ever stronger over the
fringes of that grim saharan oasis

  their enemies bound kent jabbed his
 into its holster his loyal five
looked toward him for their next move
kent pointed to the corner of the block-
house room

  get that other djicheur the son of
corsario out also corsario he goes
with us

 for a moment kent thought of

butchy he would leave him there for
the time being no time for the likes
of him now better say nothing about
him for the legionarios once discover-
ing him might tear him to ribbons
they were already dragging out cor-
sarios son

  nombre del diablo howled one
with a wild shout day of the legion
butchy had been uncovered angered
shouts vicious bootings and shrieking
scuffiings came from the far corner
on their new find the legionarios had
utterly forgotten about their object to
get the sheikh they had discovered
their most-hated enemy butch-butchy
who had led them into a v-cornered
trap that had enabled the djicheur to
corner them and take them prisoners-
a trap that had meant death for many
and nearly been the death of all of
them in three more seconds their
crazed blows would have brought sud-
den end to that deceivers life kent
rushed among them tossed them aside

  not now my brave ones this rat
will come later i must turn him over
to commandant cordoba he will look
well hanging in the legion square at
ait ahmed punishment for such
treachery should be made a public ex-
ample hurry get corsario and his
son we go to the roof he flung
about to the others bien we go
the face of corsario kent noted had
paled on hearing of the punishment to
be meted out to butchy to the desert
vandal kent stated

  for you strange one thy fate will
not be so harsh you have shown me
that you have something of the white
mans heart word of a yanqui i
have other plans for you

  corsario stared bewilderedly the
words somehow seemed to cheer the
shaken and dejected face of the desert
chieftain the crowd started out the
wide doorway to the american girls
kent said

  stay close with us winston fall

those girls in right behind the prisoners
and if you value your life dont let
either of them out of your sight for the
barest second

  si mi teniente

  kent hesitated a moment

  what happened out there in the
oasis demanded kent why didnt
you come to my rescue you were all
captured again -

  si mi teniente a swarm fully a
hundred of those pariah dogs rushed us
with carbines we hadnt reached any
firearms we hadnt a chance we
lost three men killed four we were
helpless to fight back the rest of us
were beaten and herded back into the
prison stockade we were to be tor-
tured this morning

  who were killed asked kent anx-
iously

  verde paquito and rodriguez shot
when they tried to get through to you
kent nodded fierce lights of battle
danced before his eyes things had
looked so bright-perhaps that was the
trouble they were too bright

  as they wound their way up the dark
corridor kent worked his mind thought-
fully a dark shadow was following
along after the blond girl the airedale
kent had almost forgotten about him
he wondered if the dog did not belong
to the girl it followed so closely onto
her heels

  the first thing that he must do kent
told himself was to get the girls into
a safe corner next to make positive
that corsario and his son were secure
prisoners some place near his hand if
humanly possible he must set about to
free the rest of his legionario comrades
somewhere out there in the oasis his
eyes roved over the hulking shadows
of the machine guns behind him he
must get those up to the roof in some
way he must

  above all he must get his men and
himself to that roof its stout embra-
zures and the tall watch towers so that

they might remain in command of their
present situation it was a momentous
problem still kent figured that they
had a fighting chance for their lives

  his  in hand kent led the way
through those underground corridors
and up toward an entryway leading ap-
parently to the roof they avoided the
rear of the rambling place and pushed
up that set of crumbling stairs before
them

  each moment that passed kent ex-
pected to come face to face with trouble
stealthily fearfully he stared through
the great rooms of the ancient block-
house as they passed them empty
the place seemed now utterly deserted
strange that

  as they gained the upper regions
bright tropic light met their eyes
winding winding that age-old stair-
case led them out into the sun-glaring
heavens the spacious roof spread be-
fore them then kents ears went stiff
with tense apprehension he heard the
wild and thunderous boom of the desert
tom-toms the bestial carryings-on of
the djicheur and bedouin torturers

  so that was why the blockhouse
had been so deserted eh  every one
every djicheur and his children had as-
sembled for the great fiesta the mo-
mentous torture hour had arrived the
legionarios grunting and sweating
pushed their heavy prisoners out onto
the roof breathless and staring the
american girls followed after kent and
winston exploring all parts of the
cement roof now littered with sand from
the giant sirocco kent found nothing
but loneliness the tall framework of
the iron watch tower reared its rusted
bones skyward like a grimacing skele-
ton all was clear the morning air
was now silent and windless the
sirocco had passed

  vengan come he shouted to his
comrades

  darting about the roof the legion-
arios reconnoitered every watch turret
the legion of manana



and parapet at its four comers were
four inclosed pill boxes or cement
sentry boxes kent waved his pistol
toward those

  put the girls in one and the pris-
oners in another he ordered

  the legionarios placed corsario and
his son separately in each of the south-
ern turrets and the girls in the northern
end as that would be the most free
from shell fire it was probable in the
event of trouble-trouble which kent
fully anticipated the dark-haired
american girl was weeping bitterly
within the protected turret kent
strode to the walls and peered in

  bear up he encouraged in kindly
voice i think the worst is over
were going to get you out of here
somehow just hold tight for a little
while-and well get you out he
swung about to his men to dorme
he called

  here rene in here with you
into this turret with these women
your one job will be to protect them
guard them with your life let no
disaster come to them over your dead
body

  no senor nothing shall the
legionario ducked into the sentry box
and thrust his rifle up before him

  to his four remaining legionarios
kent called

  quick down to the cellar bring
up a machine gun apiece and all the
ammunition you can carry ill hold
guard here with dorme until you get
back

  the four rushed through the door
and clattered back down the stairs
kent then hastened across the roof and
like a desperation-impelled monkey
scrambled up the iron watch tower
reaching its wind-swept heights he
stared across the swaying tops of the
green date palms below

  the mad boom of the tom-toms and
the maniacal shriek of the djicheur
voices was reaching into a low rever-

berating thunder now with the wild
chants and the blood-crazed howls cold
chills leaped through kents being the
djicheurs were at their torturings
there was no other answer

  great fires were crackling skyward
lumping struggling objects jutted
strangely from the sands at the far
edge of the oasis horsemen raced by
and tossed spears toward those abject
queerly working lumps that studded the
sands in other spots the black red
and motley colored robed women of the
warriors danced about the victims be-
fore them in the sand

  hot irons-brandishing scimitars-
plunges-screams of pain-howls of
bestial delight driven to a frenzy bor-
dering on madness kent stared at the
sight in horror

  how could he ever rescue his doomed
comrades kent asked himself that
question over and over again with a
prayer on his lips he started down the
high tower he must try swerving
around the watch tower to its front he
gazed off across the wide expanse of
that lonely sahara northward would
he see anything he had hoped

  with straining eyes he gazed the
sun was again beating down on his
skull fit to blister it sweat trickled
down his back and wet the wrists of
his tunic not a sign of the main body
of the legion met his gaze hadnt
they received his message  surely they
had what had happened

  from the southeast he saw long
shadowy lines of brown dust clouds ris-
ing along the horizons growing larger
ever larger in growing rows the
desert djicheur the moor and the bed-
ouin were marching in to el ougadir
to come to the aid of their renowned
chieftain el corsario

  kent studied the terrain all about
the environs of the blockhouse as far
as he could see were seething bands of
the desert tribesmen racing dancing
marching in wild chant to the tribal tor-


the popular magazine

turings and shriekings for the blood of
christians the call to war against
spain against the legion as kent
watched those mobs seething -around the
fort he realized that they were com-
pletely surrounded

   his heart heavy with the awful truth
kent dropped back down to the broad
expanse of the roof what could they
do how could they ever clear that
oasis it didnt appear as though they
ever could the problem seemed utterly
insurmountable they were trapped

if the legion didnt come- well

it would mean their end desperate
kent worked his mind to a frenzy he
must somehow try to get that radio
set the roof door suddenly swept
back his legionarios appeared with
a machine gun each four and several
belts of ammunition stolen legion
machine guns the sight of those
blued steel weapons brought new hope
and fresh courage to kent

  oley he shouted to his men set
em up spread em out on the roof

  the guns were arranged in a v
pointed toward the roof door am-
munition belts were run through and
entered into their feeds

  thanks to butchy the rat
gritted kent we have our own ma-
chine guns and-ammunition

  the legionarios nodded grimly their
tired faces seamed with tough lines of
weariness kent swung on them
thoughtfully

  listen amigos beat it down to
that rear kitchen room of the block-
house and gather together all the
djeelaba robes and bournouses that you
can find also turbans bring them up
here all you can carry get those
from the silent ones that are silent
pronto

  in a few moments more than a dozen
djeelabas and other motley robes had
been carried up and piled onto the roof
kent tossed them around to his com-
rades

  get into these he commanded

  the men hurriedly slipped into them

  just a little legion game laughed
kent acridly a shake of the dice with
death perhaps it will work quien
sabe perhaps not at the least these
machine guns will give this desert scum
something to think of blood of my
life

  the men nodded interestedly wait-
ing kent turned to winston

  ive a difficult mission for you com-
parer o

  bien replied the tough-hearted
soldier name it

  weve got to try to recover our
radio set stated kent its down
there in that row of djicheur tents-the
third one up from the end butchy
in his treachery brought it here come
ill show you which one it is he mo-
tioned winston to the edge of the
parapets on the roof leaned out over
there just-

  their words were cut off by foot-
falls coming up the stairs kent rushed
toward the door looked down the stair-
case it was corsarios younger son
returning turning to his men kent
ordered

  shove those machine guns into the
parapets facing the northern desert
cover your bodies well with these
djeelabas and turbans be prepared to
swing into action and toward the roof
door should i call you winston
cover the door from behind with that
last machine gun

  si sefior

  in a moment the door swung back on
the roof the tall sheikh and younger
son of corsario stepped out onto the
spacious roof now blistering in the heat
of the noonday african sun

  there are orders sahib he ques-
tioned coolly

  the eyes of the young sheikh swept
around the roof the three legion
djicheurs in their white djeelabas
were facing guardedly off in the north-
the legion of manana



era sahara waiting for the enemy
legion it made an impressive moslem
sight for the sheikh to every out-
ward indication all was well

  your father stated kent calmly
is now quite indisposed and taking his
siesta for the next half hour he
wishes me to tell you that you are to
bring the captured legion radio set here
to him on the roof at once

  the sheikh bowed gracefully turned
to go

  kent held up his hand signally
there is one other order this one
must be carried out immediately all
of the prisoners the legionarios must
also he brought here for questioning
the face of the young sheikh paled
to deathly white

  but that sahib is-impossible our
tribesmen and our tribeswomen are at
the tortures the fiesta is on the
warring tribes that have come to our
aid must have full honors done them
in addition many of the legionario
dogs have already been dispatched to
their heathen gods

  kents blood chilled

  name of mohammed he rasped
can you not carry out your fathers
own orders are you such a weak
one such an untalented one and such
a yellow-bellied one that you cannot
do thy great and illustrious fathers bid-
ding listen you of no talent these
legionario dogs as you call them must
be brought here for questioning they
may possess legion information of
great value to us in our battle against
the legion forces of spain will you
or will you not do your fathers bid-
ding

  the face of the young sheikh paled
he had never known what it was to
disobey the iron-bound orders issued by
his father he salaamed low

  i will do my best sahib

  mash-allah it is well i will in-
form your father that he has a daring
and obedient son

  the sheikh slipped quietly from the
roof and down the stairs

  kent turned relieved to winston
he hoped that the radio would be
brought that some of his comrades
might be recovered they could liter-
ally do no more than hope to his
men kent said

  listen brave ones this little game
cant continue long somethings bound
to snap here and damned soon weve
got to prepare for the worst winston
you go up into that watch tower keep
us constantly advised of what is happen-
ing around us and on the desert tell
us the very first second you see any
trace of the legion coming from the
north hear	

  si mi teniente

  of his other men kent asked

  how many machine guns are left
in the cellar 

  six answered paddy a little slav
quickly

  you three hustle below and get them
up here just as fast as you can we
will need them also gather in every
round of ammunition that you can lay
bands on too if you can find some
in that lousy kitchen bring drinking
water

  si teniente

  with a wild scrambling the three men
tore down the stairs for the lower realms
of the blockhouse

  a matter of a half hour or so later
ten legion machine guns had been ar-
rayed within those jagged blockhouse
battlements that overlooked the desert
oasis of el ougadir the husky
legionarios now in their long flowing
djeelabas while enacting their strange
drama on that desert stage of death and
privation waited through tense mo-
ments for-come what may and in
the hopes that they might again clasp
the stalwart hands of their comrades
before the saharan syn should set on
that crimson day

  anxiously kent made a survey of


the popular magazine

all the weapons and fighting equipment
that the men had deposited in a pile
on the roof he ran his fingers over
a bronzed and bristled chin studiously

   ten machine guns approximately
ten thousand roundbl ammunition
eight rifles with baypn four scimi-
tars two pistols a small quantity of
rifle ammunition very little pistol am-
munition still a mighty good haul
with headwork we can give these desert
hyenas something serious to think
about

   kent himself still had two bandoleras
 of pistol cartridges slung over his
 shoulder like all the officers of the
 legion espanol he carried only a skber
 and pistol and for that pistol plenty of
 ammunition

   there came a wild shout from the
watch tower

  down yelled winston they
come

  you mean the legion fairly
screamed kent

   no teniente our prisoners que
vea they are so few

   how many yelled kent

   there was a momentary silence the
 hearts of those legionarios marooned
 on that desolate roof oozed blood while
 they waited for their answer

   i am counting them announced the
 lookout man they come through the
 palms twenty my brave ones
 twenty of our comrades led by the
 white-robed devils twenty and no
 more

   it was unbelievable yet kent real-
 ized even that number was fortunate
 from the seventy-six captured and
 eliminating the few that had died with
 kent it meant that over forty had gone
 to the torture hours of the bloody
 djicheur-had met a fate worse than
 death-a slow living hell it was un-
 bearable to think on what would be-
 come of them a long quiet hush fell
 over those courageous legionarios that
 waited through the hellish moments on

that sun-blazed roof of doom they
waited until the shuffle of heavy legion
boots resounded from the long stairway
leading from the lower confines of the
ancient blockhouse

  up encouraged kent pull your-
selves together my tough hearts my
nameless heroes let us show no
weakness before these desert hyenas

  there was a sharp rustle among the
men one and all they fell back into
their parapet pits and faced out over
their machine guns

  drawing their white djeelaba robes
tightly around them they faced off into
the desert far below then slowly
through the doorway filed those khaki-
clad soldados of the legion espanol
more dead than alive did they look
one by one they marched in and swayed
across the sun-glaring roof of the
blockhouse

  eighteen nineteen-twenty kent
counted them tragically winston was
right blood was dripping from the
nose ears and mouths of some ap-
parently a few had been literally
yanked from the hands of the torturers
a barefooted djicheur runner massive
and bronzed dropped the three radio
cases to the floor of the roof and stared
about the battlements curiously kent
with eager eyes stared down at the un-
damaged set the sight of that emer-
gency military equipment was meat and
drink to his eyes

  in strange bewilderment the various
legionarios took in the sight before
their eyes in rough arabic kent or-
dered the men to one side he had
to play his little legion game with
dame death and the djicheurs stub-
bornly the men glowered at kent was
he to develop into a traitor as well
they would believe anything now the
tall sheikh stood before kent

  allah-illah-el-illah-allah  blazed
kent and where are the other pris-
oners the rest of these infidel sol-
diers  his gray american eyes pierced
the legion of manana



into the face of the moslem like chilled
steel

  it is too late effendi they are be-
yond recovery they would be of no
value to you for gaining information
shweeia shweeia even now they
are with their heathen gods

  it is well then answered kent in
slow arabig choking a sob deep in his
soul his brain was pounding in fiery
booms our brave tribesmen they
are ready to go into battle he de-
manded coldly

  yes effendi

  we have plenty of weapons and am-
munition 

  yes plenty

  what is the strength of our bands
at the moment

  fully a thousand warriors more
are pouring in from the south con-
stantly

  the number staggered kent he
gripped himself

  that is well now listen well to
the commands of thy illustrious father
you will take command of the tribes-
men the men shall be divided into
three groups one shall move east the
other west and the last north as soon
as you have made the proper arrange-
ments you will command your men and
move off is all clear

  yes sahib and these prisoners
your fathgr and i wihktake care of
the prisoners we wish to question
them here at our leisure be off to your
work there is no time to be lost in
idle talk

  the great iron door closed behind
the white form of the sheikh peculiar
doubts assailed kents mind was the
sheikh convinced thoroughly kent
wondered barely had the door swung
to than there came a hoarse shout from
the watch tower

  la legion they come they
come many miles away-far in the
north

  a rippled shout of excitement burst

from the throats of the five the new

arrivals stared in hollow-eyed aston-
ishment at the djicheur-robed legion-
arios around them what was this
queer game who was friend who
foe were tfyshnee or were they
merely being tovtured a bit more in this
their latest dreaming

  off with these arm and ankle lash-
ings commanded kent with grim
admiration he stared from one to the
other of his recaptured legionarios
dont stand there staring at me as
though i were a living ghost im not
another butchy amigos its true
youre free-for the time being
bravo he bellowed exultantly

  but its sure wonderful to see you
men again pull yourselves together
now my men i dont know how long
well be breathing the same air with
these wolf dogs of this cursed place but
for the moment we are here together
free it may be our last grand and
glorious stand against our hated enemy
the djicheur-but viva espaiia we
are here lets give em hell while we
last

  little by little the men recognized
their freedom and slowly their eyes
took on a new and blessed light a light
akin to that of an innocent man doomed
to death and just removed from the
scaffold of the dead to which he had
been wrongly assigned in kindly sur-
veillance kent moved among his men
and encouraged them unloosening lash-
ings and examining their wounds
came another shout from the watch
tower

  teniente

  yes shouted kent speak
the djicheur dozens of them are
rushing the blockhouse stairs

  quick yelled kent to his men
all of you get into those djeelabas
there- on that pile fix those turbans
around your heads

  the men leaped to the task they
were four short


the popular magazine

  you four ordered kent into
those sentry boxes there at the wings
of the roof

  the four remaining dashed off to
the corners and disappeared around the
walls of the sentry boxes that held the
american women corsario and his
son to the others kent commanded
get around those machine guns
push them into the embrazures kneel
down behind them pull your djeelabas
well around you be ready for any-
thing should i call but dont make a
false move unless i call ive got to
try to bluff this thing through once
more

  the clatter of many footsteps rushed
up the stairway kent went - to the
door braced his broad shoulders
against the big iron door and stared
down a nonchalant malevolent smile on
his weather-seamed face

 quint var who comes he
shouted sharply

  the young sheikh and son of cor-
sario pushed through the opening of
the door and on onto the roof ques-
tioningly he glanced about the roof
behind him squeezed his brother
sheikh obviously they were looking
for the legion prisoners they were
nowhere to be seen had the yankee
cherif disposed of them by black magic 
where were they in each of the em-
brazures bent over a rifle or a machine
gun obviously was a djicheur the
legionarios where were they

  what sort of a scene is this com-
manded kent roughly what do you
mean blundering in here like a pack of
half-starved jackals take your un-
mannered ones and get out of here
the sheikh held up his hand warn-
ingly a moment

  my warriors demand that you return
the legionarios to them so that they
may continue the tortures until the
battle with the legion commences they
had not completed their fiesta effendi
when the heathen swine were taken from

them if thou and my father have
finished with the examinations--

  kents mind was working like a trip
hammer

  thy father will notify thee when
it pleases him not before answered
kent stormily

  i would have that word with my
father now parried the young sheikh
there was sharp impatience in his
voice i and my brother officers wish
to confirm his orders and his wishes
it is not that i do not trust thee sahib
but my comrades here demand it if
we-

  kent glared ruefully toward the
young sheikh in vitreous arabic he
blazed 

  listen thou of no talent thy
fathers orders were that he must not
be disturbed did he not tell thee so
with his own lips as to the legion-
arios thou wilt hear of them in due
time they will be kept in the block-
house until after the battle there is
no time now

  but sahib these men demand it
they will not be appeased further
heretofore our bands have never been
divided into three we always attack
in a massed body we like it not to
have our forces divided this is new
this plan of three arms instead of one
we wish to have a few words with my
father

  dort nalda spat kent viciously
out with you you crazy jackals
you have heard your fathers orders
that you take commands from my lips
there they are are not three arms
stronger than one thinkest thou that
thou knowest more than the gray years
of thy illustrious father out with
you hasten to do his bidding before
you and thy brother sheikhs draw down
his wrath and he plunge you all to
allah on the points of scimitars

  slowly stubbornly the young sheikhs
backed toward the doorway as they
moved back however kent felt a

pop-b
the legion of manana



freezing icy chill race down his spine
felt hot darts leap through his veins
corsarios son he noted was staring
with wide astonished eyes at the feet
of one of his white-robed djicheurs
of the legion that bent over a machine
gun in one of the embrazures roughly
kent pushed the sheikh through the
doorway and with an angry growl
dropped the heavy iron bar that held
the metal door in place

  then flinging about in his tracks
kent stared at the spot where the
sheikh had been gazing for a scant
second the blood seemed to leave
kents heart the wind had moved two
sets of djicheur robes far above
their puttees and exposed the khaki
legs of the legionarios the sheikh
knew now that the men behind those
guns were legionarios the game was
up

  striding across the heat-riven roof
he hurried to the watch tower and
climbed its rust-scaly sides to the turret
his shoulder ached and throbbed tor-
turously as he climbed it was swell-
ing badly and kent saw that it was go-
ing to give him trouble

  in the top of the turret with his big
australian legionario kent peered off
into the heat-waving horizons around
the oasis from that high watch tower
overlooking the desert to all points of
the compass they could watch the direc-
tions of the desert bands on their at-
tacks against the legion through
their radio they would have to try to
inform the arriving legion of the direc-
tional movements of the enemy

  some six or seven miles to the north-
ward a long snakelike line of khaki
wound across the sahara for the lone
outpost of el ougadir but immedi-
ately around the walls of that crumbling
blockhouse seethed hundreds on hun-
dreds of infuriated djicheur and moor-
ish tribesmen their blood lusting for the
lives of those marooned legionarios
atop the blockhouse walls

 pop-b

  could they ever hold out until the
main legion forces arrived it was a
question the sheikhs and their tribes-
men could be expected to commence a
storm on the fort at any moment it
would be impossible for them to hold
out against those vast hordes that
seethed around the walls if they once
broke through to the roof to win-
ston kent said

  we fight now its to the death
keep a sharp lookout and report every-
thing

  o k sir

  kent then dropped down the tower
and dashed among his legionarios

  off with those moslem djeelabas
my tough fighters get ready for ac-
tion therell be red hell to pay here
in a few seconds what do you say
men that we give these black-hearted
jackals a few rounds of legion fire
just for our comrades out there on the
djicheur torture racks that we take
two for one before we batten this place
down for our last stand what say

  yeah viva viva espana they
shouted

  bueno answered kent push
those machine guns up to the doorway
well have callers soon you can de-
pend on it throw the bar on that door
stand by

  atkinson a little red-headed irish-
man threw the bar

  wide open commanded kent he
was kneeling behind a machine gun

  the irishman threw the door open
wide almost simultaneously there
came the padding rush of sandaled feet
up the stairway wild shouts angry
and threatening bellowed up the corri-
dors

  give it to em blazed kent

  rata-taca-tac-tac-tac-taca-taca-taca

  the blued guns of death roared out
hot lead and rifle balls whistled up the
stairway and past the heads of the
legionarios fierce screams and howls
filled the air down the darkened hall-


the popular magazine

way burst after burst of those deathly
streams of hurling lead sprayed along
the crumbling walls while plaster
crackled along the steps and chunks of
cement rolled down among the dying
and wounded arabic curses and wild
commands of battle rang through those
ancient walls of the blockhouse once
more the scene of red carnage sud-
denly from below the firing ceased

  basia shouted kent enough for
just now weve got to watch our am-
munition he leaped to the doorway
and peered furtively down the stairway

  the steps were stacked high with
white robes and fallen forms of the
djicheurs a lone rifle ball whined past
kents face as he stared he ducked
back

  enough weve accounted for half
a dozen sheikhs and cherifs and better
than two to one for our legionarios out
there in the oasis

  leaping to the door he forced it
closed and swung the heavy iron bar
down into place there were heavy
dogs at top and bottom for securing
the door against attack as there were
in all the garrisons of the legion
espanol he dropped down the top
one atkinson worked up the bottom
one

  thats better said kent now
secure everything get one machine
gun down here to guard the doorway
the others in the embrazures watch
every round of ammunition you men
because well need every bullet before
this wild watch is over dont fire a
shot until i give the command

  the legionarios hurried their guns
back into the embrazures along the
high-walled parapets leaping down
behind them they arranged their am-
munition handily and went over the
breech blocks and feeding pawls to
make sure that all was well kent
yanked the radio set around before him
tossed back its cover and released the
ending key

  with tense fingers he commenced
calling his station off there ahead of
the blockhouse among those rolling
sand dunes he knew one of their legion-
arios would be riding a small borrico
with ear phones attached to his ears on
the alert he shoved the portable
phones over his own ears and com-
menced tapping the key

         comandante cordoba

          legion regiment 

         en marcha

  over and over kent sent out the call
then he listened intently slowly at
first then more rapidly came the ac-
knowledgment with fast-beating heart
kent rushed out the message

  this is kent at el ougadir oasis we are
marooned on roof of blockhouse with twenty-
five legionarios and two american girls
rush help corsario has band a thousand
strong main body is attacking you from
southwestward advise deploying your men
to southward on first attack

  in a few moments kent heard the
wireless singing shrill tunes in his ears

  proceeding with all possible haste we are
ready for attack our forces equal to cor-
sarios try to hold out until we can get
there in a few hours try to give me infor-
mation of djicheur movements when you can

cordoba

  kent signed off and slammed down
the cover over the set as he did so
there came a hoarse shout from the
watch tower

  cuidado look out warned the
lookout man the djicheur is climb-
ing the south wall with ladders and
scimitars

verdad yelled kent in answer

  on the same instant there came a deep
rumble at the door leading to the roof
another the great bar groaned under
the impact paddy the little slav
tensed to rigidity on his machine-gun
tripod seat before the door and steadied
his sharp beady eyes down the barrel
the legion of manana



sights kent swung to his other legion-
arios

  be ready to bring those guns into
action in case they break down that
door he warned

  the men nodded acknowledgment and
faced around with their guns the door
bulged creaked groaned and sagged
but did not open after a short time
of concerted pounding the racket
stopped

  well thats over barked kent
they wont try that again

  suddenly two white-robed objects
loomed over the jagged battlements at
the southern walls scarcely thinking
instinctively kent raised his  and
fired two blue carbines pushed stealth-
ily over those edges of the parapets
kents pistol shot cut the quiet air
over the blockhouse roof instantly
one of those lumping white objects
dropped from view over the ledge
orange fire spat from the muzzle of
the second white-robed figure hot
lead screamed past kents ears there
was a howl of pain from somewhere
behind a legion rifle spat off at
kents left the white fingers of the
second djicheur vanished suddenly
from the roof ledges

  anxiously kent rushed to the walls
and peered over examining them a
wide ledge ran around the southern ex-
tension about twelve feet below the
roof the first ledge could be reached
by going hand over hand from the crude
windows that jutted from the second
floor

  above that the next ledge had to
be reached by ladders the northern
side of the blockhouse was impossible
to scale unless one had long ladders
the djicheur however already had two
long ones at the southern walls if
he could keep a steady stream of his
warriors pouring over those ladders to
the roof kent knew that it would not
be long until they should run out of
ammunition

  after that outnumbered a hundred
to one for hand-to-hand fighting they
would not stand a chance it would
mean their end or if the djicheur
pourted his men faster over those walls
than his gunners could stem it would
be equally bad

  le corsaire le corsaire angry
french and arabic voices shouted
toward the roof of the garrison

  so they wanted el corsario now
eh mob crazy thought kent they
do not know what they want fickls
and with doubts they believed their
leader a traitor to them now if cor-
sario had stepped into their midst at
that moment he would have been greeted
with a volley of mauser bullets kent
peered slightly over the walls to get
a glimpse of what was going on below
rifle balls whistled to all sides of him
he leaped back hastily dios if that
seething mob ever got started up those
walls it would only be a question of
minutes with his few legionarios

  abajo yelled the lookout man
again watch the southern parapets
again the djicheur brings more lad-
ders  more men

  kent leaped back among his men
get these guns more to the center
of the roof hold your fire until you
are positive of hitting a djicheur its
our only hope with our small supply of
ammunition to hold out until the
legion gets here

  the men brought their machine guns
into play mainly on the southern battle-
ments suddenly like a rising tide of
white those djicheur robes commenced
pouring over the walls kent rallied
his men and gave them the order to
fire at their own discretion the loyal
machine guns rattled out their death to
the silent ones that pressed ever con-
stantly over those southern parapets of
the ancient fort

  kent watched his stack of ammuni-
tion dwindle to a puny level and still
those white-robed hordes continued to


the popular magazine

boil over the sun-bleached and glaring
parapets from the watch tower there
came another shrill call from the aus-
tralian

  a band of two or three hundred
djicheur have crept around the north-
east dunes and are lying in secret wait
to surprise the legion

  bien acknowledged kent and
leaped for his radio key that was an
old game of the desert tribesmen at-
tract the legion to the foreground and
then sneak up on the backs of the
marching troops after they had passed
thus were they pressed into a trap
from which there was no escape thus
however did kent toss back the cover
of his radio set and inform his regi-
mental commander of the movements
of the djicheur

  all around kent lead and rifle balls
flew the djicheur would reach the
white walls of the parapets fire a few
shots then would come the rata-taca-
taca-tac-taca of legion machine guns
and the desert brigands would drop
from view behind those gaunt walls

  from all around kent came the howls
and screams of the wounded and the
dying his comrades and the djicheur
atkinson hollow-eyed and exhausted
toppled over his gun tripod a bullet
through his cheek kent jerked the
machine gun clear leaping atop the
tripod he jammed in its last belt of
precious ammunition dazedly he saw
those bronzed bestial faces slipping
over the battlements toward him he
held down his gun trips

  leaping along the cement the mauser
mowed down the djicheur a shot
piercing and torturing drove into kents
right shoulder already throbbing with
pain

  each dragging moment was more and
more hand to hand now along those
jagged sun-scorched parapets that
kent and each of his legionarios tragic-
ally realized spelled the end in num-
bers they stood not a chance against

those overwhelming hordes kent
counted fourteen of his men propped
stiffly against the blue sky that glared
through the embrazures-fourteen silent
heroes who had stemmed the tide of the
djicheur their eyes stared glazedly
across the vast sahara and beyond

  below them the ever-increasing shell
fire of the approaching legion lifted
its wild battle staccato into the searing
air those legion rifles across the dis-
tant dunes crackled louder and louder
while scimitars and djicheur mausers
rushed over the golden sands-the
dunes of el ougadir once more running
crimson with the blood of legionario
and djicheur

  through what seemed interminable
hours those loyal machine guns con-
tinued their desultory clatter continued
a sham that could not last for long in a
vain endeavor to make the djicheur be-
lieve that those few imprisoned legion-
arios possessed ample ammunition

  suddenly through that maze of
groans and wild battle cries kent heard
the sharp blast of a bugle it was near
at hand the regimental call to attack
the legion was storming the block-
house hill simultaneously there came
a dry hacking yell from the turreted
watch tower

  la legion mis compafieros the
sun-parched lips of the australian
screamed down the startling news
la legion they come

  kent waved a weary acknowledgment
around him he stared at silent ammuni-
tionless machine guns their smoke-
seared muzzles dropped toward the floor
of their roof the last belt of car-
tridges was near his foot he grabbed
it shoved it into the feed pawls of the
nearest mauser rata-taca-tac-tac-taca
it sounded-

  kent laughed harshly hysterically
the legion eh they come just a
moment too late

  rene dorme had left his sentry box
that protected the women now and was
the legion of manana



 fighting hand to hand over the parapets
 with a huge moor that towered twice
 his size and weight kent swung the
 nose of his machine gun around almost
 listlessly rata-taca-tac-tac-taca-taca
 the big moor toppled a dozen more
  swept over the walls

  a mi la legion a- the

 desperate plea of the wounded and dy-
 ing legionarios groaned pitifully out on
 the smoke-filled air still the djicheur
 swept over the southern parapets

   those white robes seemed endless in
 their pourings bartolome and valen-
 tino also winston who had now come
 down from his watch tower to add to
 the last few of their weakening forces
 rushed the band of djicheurs-it was
 their last stand eleven strong they
 were that brave little band of the
 legion eyes bloodshot and bodies
 wracked with pain and exhaustion

   rifle butts crashed over djicheur
 turbans scimitars flashed from the
 hands of both legionario and djicheur
 kent with his last few remaining pistol
 cartridges accounted for several of
 those rushing desert warriors for a
 grim second standing over the dead
 kent flung a look around him

   nine had emerged from that last
 awful hand-to-hand slaughter alive
 for a scant second the roof was clear
 a lull in the battle they were giving
 those bloody djicheurs something to
 think about that was certain but
 kents body seemed to sag as he looked
 about him

   their every last round of ammunition
 was gone

   a few more moments and they would
 all be cut down before a fresh onslaught
 of scimitars above those bronzed faces
 that would sweep over the southern em-
 brazures cornered desperate kent
 sought escape they must try to make
 a break through the door and to the
 sands below to reach their legion lines

   come shouted kent with parched
 throat

  beckoning to his sweaty exhausted
comrades kent dashed for the stone
sentry boxes and grabbed the american
girls by the arms

  out of it quick with me to
winston he yelled try to get cor-
saria out of that other sentry box

  one of the legionarios drew the bars
of the great iron door kent the
american girls behind him his empty
 pushed out before him plunged
for the stairway then he staggered
back a mob was rushing up that stair-
way thus would they go then
kents eyes seemed to bulge from their
sockets he stared again incredulously
it couldnt be

  he was face to face with coman-
dante cordoba

  the legion commander was leaping
up the crumbling steps two at a time
his pistol thrust out before him from
a chin strip beside him rushed sala-
zar his long legion bayonet gleaming
from the muzzle of his rifle on sight
of kent the raiding party drew back
staggeringly on the stairs

 a mi la legion gasped kent
breathlessly he lurched weakly against
the chest of his commanding officer
the regimental leader caught his weary
lieutenant in his arms held him

  kent realized dazedly that the thun-
der of rifle and artillery fire had ceased
a strange quiet gripped the fort to-
gether then the little band pushed back
up onto the roof stretcher bearers
hurried here and there attending the
wounded and carrying them down to
the medical crews

  on the roof kent sank to his knees
the comandante pressed a flagon of
rum to his lieutenants lips and called
to the hospital attendant to look after
his shattered shoulder and swollen ear
lobe

  you saved our lives my life
praised kent

  no senor you had already saved
yourselves but even if i had then we


the popular magazine

would only be square didnt you save
mine that wild night in toum agoug
the comandante raised kent to sitting
posture youre completely exhausted
from the strain but no importa well
have you bettered very shortly now
kent stared around the rooftop it
did not seem right that there were no
more djicheurs pouring over those
white and tan sun-bleached ramparts

  we have had a glorious victory
enthused the comandante through a face
begrimed with powder burns and red
bruises thanks to your well-directed
information we deployed our troops
around the enemy and literally raked
him in when he attacked when la
oficina real in madrid hears of this
youll be stepped up to a capitdn at
least

  kents eyes seemed to be seeing
things far away it was all too good
to be true

  you-you mean that its all over
that we have really beaten the dji-
cheur 

  beaten him for dios amigo
there are no more djicheurs cor-
doba swept his arm off toward the
south over there only a handful of
djicheurs are melting into the farther
south the saharan villages and the
traveling caravans will not be troubled
with djicheurs for many months to
come my brave one

  kent staggered to his feet feeling
better after several drafts of rum and
the cheering news from the legion
commander from his left hand there
came a wild scuffling excited shouts

  viva viva what a find it
was salazar talking look the
teniente has been keeping back good
news mira

  the crowd looked the silent form
of el corsario huge haggard and
shamefaced was brought into their
midst the american girls now recog-
nizing their actual security took their
first look at a real desert kaid one

and all the group crowded around the
bound form of the great desert vandal

el corsario kent looked down at his
old enemy with kindly eyes then he
turned toward cordoba

  i have one favor to ask of you mi
comandante urged kent	

  you have but to name it ricardo
assured the legion commander

  that el corsario and his surviving
son be given two good tamsouk camels
with ample food and water and their
-freedom

  a startled gasp went up among the
legionarios that was the unheard-of

  for two sound reasons urged kent
seeing the hesitancy on the face of cor-
doba first he has spared the lives
of the american civilians the men he
set free on horses that he actually gave
them and sent them back to the mines
the american girls he took good care
of secondly he saved my life to-day
in the cellar of this blockhouse when
butchy shot off a  under my chin
aimed at me

  in a few words kent explained the
deception of butchy and of how he
had led his unwitting comrades into the
trap that had cost many their lives and
nearly all victory

  as to butchy you will find him at
the moment explained kent in the
cellar room bound the first turn to
the right

  there was a rush of legionario boots
down the stairs for a moment the
legion commander stroked his chin
thoughtfully

  that is a large request teniente
yet i understand how you may feel
one thing is certain he can do little
harm now his bands are all dispersed
annihilated there is nothing for him
to organize

  the comandante shrugged his shoul-
ders latin style you say that he
set free the american miners and that

the legion of manana



  verdad just so he was holding
the women for ransom the stolen
jewels he turned over to me lied kent
to plead corsarios case he has
many of the rudiments of a caballero
senor

  my bien then as you wish it you
may give him his freedom it will set
a good example to other desert kaids
will show them that their lives will be
spared by spain when they show mercy
to civilians

  kent turned to corsario whom the
legionarios were unbinding the huge
corsair stumbled to his feet kent re-
quested the rum flagon and gave the
great djicheur a hefty drink

  word of a yanqm stated kent
quietly you and your son may leave
in peace my legionarios will furnish
you with water food and a strong tam-
souk camel let this be a lesson to
you to never again demand extortion
from the legion espanol
el corsario flung kent a grateful
glance with cool deliberative voice
he answered

  i see that the word of a yanqm
is the word of honor this news shall
i spread among the tribes of the sahara
for corsario will have some ripe years
yet may allah bring his blessings upon
you

  with this short speech the great
desert chieftain and his son now freed
made low salaam to the officers before
them and swept through the roof exit
to the desert realms below

it was sunset by the time all the
wounded had been taken care of and
the great forces of the legion espanol
once more ready to start the long but
victorious trek northward over the high
atlas mountains to their post at ait
ahmed in rio de oro a small band
of murmuring legionarios stood before
the great shell-riddled doors of the an-
cient blockhouse

  richard kent whirled a khaki-clad

individual around in his tracks before
that wide-eyed group of soldiers with
a few vicious strokes he jerked the
legion buttons and the sergeant stripes
from the legionario tunic dishonored
on the body of butchy the traitor a
deathly silence gripped the watching
group

  you have nothing on me snarled
butchy the bold you can prove noth-
ing

   thats the best part of it traitorous
one blazed kent infuriatedly i
dont need to prove anything youve
proven enough against your rotten
slimy soul to be shot by the legion
each morning at sunrise for the next
twenty years-and could i perform a
miracle and accomplish just that i
would however youll look well
hanging in the legion square at ait
ahmed

  kent whirled the hated figure around
again and made sure that there were
no insignia of the legion espanol any-
where on his person then to his men
commanded roughly

  take him pronto out of my
sight onto that burro

  the legionarios roughly prodded
butchy onto the shaggy back of the
waiting animal and swept off into their
ranks with him kent weary and hag-
gard turned about and headed down
those great files of khaki that suddenly
seemed to spread before him there
were two lines he vaguely realized
trim and straight he saw his coman-
dante backing off in lively stride his
saber flashing in the evening sun over
his head his bloodshot eyes seemed
and seemed not to see these things
he heard the sharp voice of the legion
commander ring down those loyal khaki
lines like the snap of a whiplash

  presenten las armas

  then against those long scarlet rays
of the sinking saharan sun he saw the
long rows of legion carbines snap to
attention to present arms i dazedly he


the popular magazine

saw those blue barrels emblazoned like
burnished fire before his eyes a lump
rushed to kents throat stuck there
on both sides of him were his loyal
tough-hearted legionarios they were
presenting arms-to him snapping
his back to wavering weary attention
kent brought his right hand up to his
legion cap while a hot gladsome mist
floated before his eyes

  with strange light-moving feet
kent walked along those khaki lines and
beneath the floating scarlet-and-gold
banners of old spain toward the rear
of the long lines of legionarios there
came a shrill blast from the trumpeter
slowly those long lines commenced
their easy trek northward toward the
gaunt mountains of old morocco that
loomed in the farther west

  at the rear of those slow-wending
lines lieutenant kent rather awkwardly
pushed a blond-haired blue-eyed ameri-
can girl with hollow cheeks onto the
back of a great shaggy brown camel
after her he thrust a heavy chamois
bag of tinkling rubies the girl fas-
tened it securely around the neck of
her desert transport comandante cor-
doba was assisting the second girl to
his waiting lumbering mount kent
then crawled wearily up onto the broad
back beside the girl for live camels
were scarce after that holocaust in el
ougadir exhaustedly kent lurched
down onto that great shaggy back

  you poor dear brave boy whis-
pered the girl how tired you are
yet i do not believe you have a charmed
life

  kent noted beside them on the
ground a tiny shaggy animal of the
same color as the camel-a loyal-hearted
airedale that had done his part in the
great regime of things-a faithful
that kent later learned belonged to the
young woman beside him

  as their camel swayed gently along
kent gazed fondly at the weary yet
dauntless little animal then dreamily

stared out across the vast reaches of
the southern sahara toward a golden
dust cloud that marked the exit of el
corsario and his son deeper into their
desert lands kent looked across
toward his admired comandante

  verdad amigo it is a strange world
out here in africa is it not inquired
kent musingly

  si answered cordoba with convic-
tion but what brings these thoughts
mi teniente

  i was just thinking replied kent
slowly how curious it is that a man
with no education and with his home
among sand dunes like el corsario but
with a white soul is found-like a high-
bred mastiff-among a flock of black-
hearted wolf-jackals of the desert

  quien sabe amigo as to that per-
haps our opinions would differ there

  the camels were swaying regularly
along now the last flaming rays of
the saharan sun in scarlet and gold
wavered across the skies like great
tongues of fire the girl had been
talking what was she saying kent
his body throbbing with the heat and
the pain his mind a queer tortured
maze of strange visions of memory lis-
tened 

  my father will repay you she was
saying he is wealthy he is one
of the owners of the ruby mines at
targa el mayat

  there are some things replied
kent quietly that are worth more
than any financial reward he gazed
across those wavering marching lines
of khaki and banners flying over them
such as for instance the loyalty of
ones comrades their respect and faith
in you an opportunity to save a pals
life a chance to reward an honorable
person and-kent looked straight into
those limpid blue pools of eyes of the
american girl-perhaps i ask too
much when i ask for all of these but
in addition i would greatly treasure
your friendship
the legion of manana



  friendship she mused you have
had that from the very first night i
saw you out there in the lights of that
burning caravan with pain written
across your face when you realized you
could do nothing to rescue me as i was
carried off by the djicheur she
slipped a firm smooth hand into the
bronzed and wearv one of kents kent
accepted it gratefully gladly

  then answered kent dreamily
that is all that matters life time
and i hope a mellowing friendship will
take care of the rest

  the girl was silent

  your name inquired kent
  doris bennett

  i like that its pretty mines
richard kent

  that i like even better she slowly
said

  as the two young people stared off
into that dazzling sunset of sapphire
and flame and across the waving ban-
ners of old spain a new promise seemed
to open to them a promise of happy
days to come days free from suffer-
ing and filled with a radiant happiness
such as only youth can know thus
did those long lines of tramping feet
wearily yet happily wind their long
trek across the burnished sands of
morocco toward ait ahmed-the home
of the victorious legions of old spain

air-hot and otherwise

pver since the building of the capitol in washington there has been difficulty
in properly heating and ventilating the immense structure whether this is
because there are so many inside rooms in it or because the statesmen indulge in
so much hot air in the house and senate chambers nobody lias yet had the
wisdom or the courage to say

    david lynn superintendent of the capitol building and grounds believes
that after many experiments he at last has installed the best system available and
in support of his contention this much may be said whereas the present plan
to make the temperature of the structure suit the comfort of the people in it
the system in the good old days was to advise the people to suit their clothing
to the temperature the way the dear public was once treated is told in the
documentary history of the capitol in which occurs this passage concerning
the situation in 

    one difficulty to contend with in heating and ventilation of both legislative
halls arises from the difference in the clothing of the audience in the gallery and
the senators and members on the floor

    the rooms are intended for the use of congress senators and members
spending many hours in them require the temperature which they would choose in
their private homes they sit without hats or overcoats the audience in the
galleries is composed of persons who come in after a brisk walk coated bonneted
and shawled to resist an out-of-door winter temperature and sitting for only from
a few minutes to an hour or two in the galleries retain all these wrappings and
complain that they find the galleries kept at seventy degrees intolerably warm

for this there is no remedy except when entering the galleries to take off
the overcoats cloaks and shawls fitted for the temperature of the outer air

strained in the direction from which the
sound had come

  this rumbling call from his own kind
sent a rippling shiver along vagras
back his tawny black-striped body
grew tense and his strong tail lashed fit-
fully back and forth a grumble of
slow rage reverberated in his throat
only a few days before he had heard
that call and then as now his back had
tingled with a strange anger vagra
was lord of the glade in which he now
stood never before had an interloper
sent his voice into its confines there
would be a fight some day and then
vagra would be alone again

  the tall cool nurkul grass in which
vagra had been lying swayed to its tops
twelve feet above as he padded softly
toward open ground the ground was
marshy here and there lay shallow
pools of water over treacherous mud
vagra had learned where it was safe to
place his feet in a minute he came out
to the edge of the grass where it bor-
dered on a long pool of greenish water
on one side of the pool were tall trees
their branches overhanging the water
they reared up from a tangled jungle
of thorny bushes and creepers behind
them lay the twilight darkness of the
indian forest everywhere else the pool
was shut in by the reedy nurkul inter-
spersed here and there with clumps of
canebrake

  vagra leaned over the edge of the
pool and lapped noisily until his thirst
was quenched even now an occasional
rumble came from his half opened
mouth he stretched himself so that his
white furred chest scraped along the
damp ground then his anger was sud-
denly driven into the background by a
new and pressing sensation vagra was
hungry

  half hidden in the grass lay what had
once been a full grown deer that had
been three days ago before vagra
struck him down now there were
white bones and little more carrion

had eaten what vagra left for them
vagra pawed tentatively at the remains
then with a shake of his head veered
off sharply back through the reeds from
which he had come

  the reeds swayed again for some
two hundred yards until vagras mas-
sive body emerged into the open once
more he paused for a moment turn-
ing his greenish eyes toward the far
end of this savanna in which his marsh
was situated for half a mile it
stretched between the tangled mass of
trees and jungle lying all around vagra
looked back in a fleeting glance toward
the reeds and then broke in a noiseless
trot for the forest opposite him in a
moment he had disappeared a pea-
cock flew screaming harshly from the
forest where vagra had entered after
that there was again silence

  he made his way sinuously through
the forest until a thin infiltration of light
lessened the gloom about him his pace
slackened to a slow gliding crawl that
carried him to the edge of the wood
now he could see before him a large
expanse of gently undulating hills cov-
ered with short yellowish grass an
occasional tree broke the monotony of
the grasslands these were the first
rise toward the great garo hills that
stretched eastward into the province of
assam

  vagra pricked up his ears as a faint
sound was borne down to him on the
wind slowly he turned his head up-
wind and his eyes their pupils narrowed
to catch the last light of the day finally
fastened upon a herd of sambar deer
grazing close to the forest a quarter of
a mile away he slipped back into the
cover and crept along until his ears once
more warned him of the proximity of
the herd

  his pace now dropped to a crawl as
his body flattened out nearly to the
ground the pads on the bottom of his
feet carried him along soundlessly a
pause and his head peered forth through


the popular magazine

a heavy thorn bush only his head
could be seen the rest of his body
melted into an indistinguishable mass of
tawny color that blended with the un-
derbrush behind him

  the sambar were still upwind and
now scarcely twenty yards away
vagra slid through and beyond the
bush moving slowly flattened out but
ready for instant action he headed for
a buck with great pronged antlers who
as yet had no inkling of the beast that
was stalking him but suddenly the
sambars head flew up from the grass
and he stood trembling with nostrils dis-
tended the wind which had played
him false at last brought him the scent
of his enemy

   he gave a little cry and shot off to-
ward the forest at the same instant
vagra with a thunderous roar sprang
forward his body doubling with the
drive from his powerful legs the
sambar had made his start too late
vagra was to make his kill he was
beside his prey in four leaps a paw
leaped forward the pads that had been
so soft now contracted to solid bunches
of muscle his claws protruding like
gleaming fangs of steel the blow
reached out and then slashed down-
ward deep into the heaving throat of
the deer the jugular vein which had
been pulsating violently spurted a thick
stream of crimson blood as the sam-
bar stumbled to his knees vagra dealt
him a terrific blow on his neck which
mercifully put an end to his agony

   vagra with the deadly efficiency of
the tiger had made his kill it had
lasted only a few seconds the dead
buck lay before him still pumping a
thinning stream of blood as so many
others before had done that vagra
might no longer feel the gnawing of
hunger in his stomach he killed only
for food having outgrown the rapacity
of his cubhood and never having tasted
the flesh of man

   in a short time he had torn away and

devoured a hind quarter of the deer the
four-inch fangs in the front of his
mouth ripping out hunks of warm flesh
that were barely touched by his cutting
teeth before being swallowed then
vagra satiated for the moment sank
his fangs into the fore shoulder of the
beast and growling contentedly set off
for his swamp lying far distant in the
forest the carcass of his prey dragged
limply past his straining shoulder and
yet lightly for all its four hundred
pounds vagra would have food for
three more days

  the sun was still hot on the next
afternoon when vagra awoke and
stretched luxuriously a drink from
the pool passed pleasantly down his hot
throat he yawned until his jaws
seemed about to be sundered and then
ambled over toward a tamarind tree at
the edge of the marsh as he walked a
stange liquid warbling came from his
mouth incongruous in this immense
beast-the twitter of a tiger when he
is at peace with the world the sound
that makes the garos of the hills say
that the lord of the jungle carries a bird
in his throat

   this tamarind was like the others that
grew about the pool except that high
from the ground beginning twelve feet
up was a mass of deep scratches torn
deep into the bark to the living wood
beneath vagra reared up on his hind
legs to his full height and embraced the
tree with his forearms he rested there
for a moment and then digging his un-
sheathed claws into the bark raked them
downward in long even strokes that left
scars like those already there as he
did so a pleasant shiver swept from the
roots of his claws through his forearms
to his shoulders he repeated the opera-
tion until his nails were clean and sharp
then he dropped lightly to all fours and
ambled over to the small clearing where
he had left his kill the night before

  perched on the sambars haunch
were two vultures their bald necks
swamp tiger



stretched down as they plucked at the
dead flesh their heads shot up at
vagras approach but they made no
move he growled angrily and made a
little leap forward the ugly birds took
to their wings and flopped awkwardly
to a near-by tree not yet willing to for-
sake their feast

  vagra worried at the shoulder of the
buck laid bare the flesh and gulped
down great mouthfuls of meat one of
the vultures came back and stuck its head
into the hole in the sambars side
which it had gouged while vagra was
still sleeping the tiger growled again
but kept on eating the vulture grew
bolder and ate voraciously until his head
was scarcely six inches from vagras
whiskered jowls

  the birds breath stank from rotted
flesh a tigers scent is weak but this
reeking smell burned in vagras nos-
trils lifting his head from the car-
cass he swung forward his paw in a
sweeping arc the vulture jumped into
the air but too late there was a stran-
gled scream and then a sodden thud as
its body was dashed violently to the
ground it flopped about convulsively
before collapsing into a sprawled mass
of feathers vagra who had forgotten
the incident as soon as his paw struck
the struggling body went on eating

  as he ate there came a violent rus-
tling in the trees above him accompanied
by a burst of shrill chattering a swarm
of langur monkeys their silver-gray
bodies swinging effortlessly from branch
to branch came into view vagra lifted
his head and glanced toward them toler-
antly he plucked out a rib from the
sambars side slashed off the meat and
then licked the bone clean with his rasp-
like tongue the langurs caught sight
of him and dashed back frantically into
the forest there was a short silence
before curiosity and greed for the rich
mangoes brought them back gibbering
raucously to keep up their courage

  the boldest of the lot muni swung

to the tamarind over vagras head his
black face fringed with long white hair
peered down vagra growled benevo-
lently and shook his head yelling with
sudden fright muni fell over backward
and curled his tail around the branch
below where he swung to and fro curs-
ing noisily then he swung to the next
tree and vanished into the gloom vagra
licked his chops and yawned

  he walked heavily to the foot of a
mango tree at the edge of his pool
there in the cool shade he sprawled out
at full length his paws stretched
nearly to the water his back curved
slightly into the creepers at the edge of
the jungle a few minutes and he was
asleep the langurs returned this time
quietly to their interrupted meal

  vagra slept on through the hot after-
noon slept until gradually the blazing
sun sank behind the forest and long
shadows crept darkly over the glade and
pool as he lay there breathing deeply
his eyes closed the only creature to
which the tiger falls prey emerged from
the blackness of the forest

  some eight feet above vagras head
a thick bare branch jutted out over the
water there was no wind yet this
branch seemed to move for a mofnent
and then was still it moved again and
again was still in a few minutes some-
thing dropped down from the branch
and waved back and forth a pair of
lidless glassy eyes placed on the flat
top of a scaly head stared down brightly
at vagra a long body as thick as a
mans thigh scraped almost imperceptibly
over the bark of the mango tree

  sarpan the twenty-foot python loos-
ened the grip of his tail about the trunk
of the tree and edged forward his head
still waving but now nearer to vagra

  although vagra still slept the grim
advance of the python was not unob-
served high above the limb over which
sarpans scales were scraping muni
sat staring in an agony of terror in
one of his hands was clutched a half


the popular magazine

eaten mango his eyes were fixed on
the waving head of sarpan his limbs
were too heavy with fear to take him
from the scene and for the moment his
throat was tight with fear

  sarpan lowered himself another six
inches his progress was halted for
vagra now stirred uneasily a pause
and then the gliding advance was taken
up again then suddenly a scream of
pure anguish burst from munis throat
the scream had not yet died away when
vagra sprang to his feet with one bound
and turned his eyes to the tree above
in the partial darkness his eyes made
out the upreared head of sarpan and
the sharply curved neck drawn back to
strike

  sarpan struck but his hammerlike
head fell short of vagras leaping body
a claw-tipped paw shot out striking
with terrific force behind the pythons
head and nearly severing it sarpans
body uncoiled from the branch and
dropped to the foot of the tree like
a steel spring it coiled and uncoiled
whipped out convulsively cutting down
the underbrush and thudding against the
mud that bordered the pool in the
violence of the upheaval the mangled
head was snapped off and hurled far out
into the water the contortions of the
now headless body became gradually less
violent until at last they died down to
a feeble twitching

  vagra had been standing by crouched
down and growling fiercely as he
slowly relaxed a fresh disturbance came
to spoil the peace of his evening nap
with sarpan lying dead among the
creepers strength had suddenly rushed
back into munis trembling body the
flow of renewed vigor was so unex-
pected that he lost his balance and
plunged down helplessly through the
branches he landed half stunned
square on vagras broad back instinc-
tively he reached out his arms found
them wrapped around something solid
which happened to be vagras neck and

tightened them in a grip that nothing
could dislodge

  with a startled bellow vagra jumped
six feet into the air spun around and
made for the nurkul at a gallop ten
minutes later he began to grow weary
of the pace and returned to the pool
the thing which had fastened itself to
his shoulders and neck was troublesome
but not painful

  munis fright was so completely be-
yond anything that he had ever experi-
enced before that he welcomed the mo-
mentary security of his furry perch
furthermore there was a certain exhila-
ration about the dizzy pace that vagra
had set which was equally beyond the
scope of any previous experience

  panting heavily vagra crouched
down on his haunches muni scam-
pered to the ground and skipped with
somewhat frantic agility to the protec-
tion of a good-sized tree trunk he
stood behind it poised for quick action
if necessary with only his head showing
vagra turned puzzled eyes toward
munis white-whiskered face it was
the scream of a langur that had waked
him to a peril from which he had barely
escaped

  he stretched himself out on his belly
his head resting drowsily on his fore-
paws and continued his examination
muni stepped from behind his tree
and made a few steps tentatively for-
ward a liquid twittering came from
vagras throat then was interrupted
while he licked contentedly along the
side of his paw and rubbed it over his
ears and muzzle encouraged muni
came slowly forward until he was only
a few feet from vagras head

  he stopped there his head cocked on
-one side in his gentle eyes there was
little but curiosity and a faint gleam of
mischief they eyed each other vagra
got lazily to his feet and stood with
his flank toward the monkey muni
hopped straight up and down in excite-
ment then suddenly darted forward and
swamp tiger



leaped in the air to vagras back there
he took a firm hold of each of vagras
pointed ears in his small hands curled
his long black tail so that it pressed in
a dark line across vagras white chest
and chirped softly to himself vagra
arched his back and went amiably off at
a slow gallop into the jungle

  when some hours later vagra re-
turned to the pool and once more set
his teeth in the flesh of the sambar
muni slipped from his back and scam-
pered away through the trees but at
noon the next day he returned yelling
angrily at the swarm of langurs which
pursued him they had caught the
scent of tiger in muni and were driving
him half in fear of a new mysterious
manifestation that bewildered them
from their midst and so muni was re-
turning to the one friend that still was
left to him in the jungle

  as he scrambled recklessly from the
tree and scuttled over to vagra his
pursuers halted in alarm their alarm
turned to blind terror when vagra
rushed toward them emitting cavernous
roars after that muni perched on a
little hillock and waited patiently amus-
ing himself by twisting his face into
curious grimaces and making occasional
forays into the underbrush he had just
returned from one of these trips bear-
ing a bit of bright leaf which had caught
his eye when a booming roar was borne
across the marsh from the jungle be-
yond he sprang back into the cover
dropping his leaf vagra felt the famil-
iar rippling shudder along his spine
and threw back his head in an answer-
ing growl of thick rage

  it was once more dusk before muni
had the courage to come out of the jun-
gle and approach his friend vagra was
just wakening from a heavy sleep he
eyed munis sidling approach with com-
plete good nature heaved to his feet
and presented his shoulder muni clam-
bered swiftly on and they set off through
the reeds

  now the event which shortly suc-
ceeded this peaceful departure was to be
the most important one in vagras life
things might have been very different
had he not wandered into the particular
part of the jungle that evening and had
he not been carrying muni on his back

  with the last light of the day turning
to shadow vagra came upon a break in
the trees made by a wide path that had
been cut through to lessen the danger
from forest fires it offered a pleasant
relief from the thick cover through
which he had been making his way and
so he turned and followed its course

  then suddenly unexpectedly he saw
fifty feet in front of him that which
he had never seen before-a man the
man a garo hillsman returning to his
village which was still three miles away
saw vagra at the same moment for
vagra had uttered a low growl he
stood still as death his hand clutching
futilely at the short bladed dao in his
waist cloth

  for the first time in his life vagra
felt fear felt blood pounding queerly
in his throat the fear grew when
dhan that was the mans name in at-
tempting to dash backward along the
path tripped over a root and fell that
move probably saved his life vagra
saw the tall body of the man disappear
into a flat sticklike thing that lay in a
small heap and the heap rose up and
became tall again afraid puzzled he
turned and dashed into the jungle leav-
ing dhan to flee white-faced toward
his village at top speed

  it was nearly a week later that a
cavalcade of five elephants bearing pads
and howdahs drew near the little vil-
lage to which dhan had brought his
strange tale of the tiger who bore a
monkey on his back-a tiger he said
twenty feet long and a snow-white
monkey with a black face the tale had
been believed in this terror-stricken
village as such tales are in india and
the terror had heightened


the popular magazine

  in one of the howdahs borne by a
scarred old she-elephant sat gerald tu-
dor who had come up from dacca for
a tiger hunt in the garo hills a
strange fact about this village had per-
plexed him ever since they had come
in sight of it there were no people
about no children playing around the
houses as there usually are in these
hamlets and as they came nearer and
the thudding of the elephants feet was
borne over to the houses there arose
an unearthly din of clattering pans and
yelling voices

  what in gods name is all that for
shaidullah tudor shouted to his
shikari who was riding on the elephant
next to his

  shaidullah smiled for he was above
the superstitions of these simple hill
folk they seek to frighten off the
tiger sahib about which i have told
you they hear sounds but dare not
look out from their houses this striped
devil has carried off a hundred of their
people in this past month

  make it quick then and let them
know that we are here they must be
nearly out of their minds from fear of
the cursed beast

  shaidullahs mahout slapped his ele-
phant with the goad that he carried in
his right hand the animal lowered
himself groaning to his knee shai-
dullah having climbed out of the how-
dah slid down the elephants knee and
hastened to the nearest house when
he had finally made his voice apparent
above the clamor that still arose on all
sides a shrinking figure came to the
door shortly afterward the noise died
away and more people emerged from
their houses

  i have come said shaidullah with
a sahib to destroy the devil who has
been taking your children and men do
you have news

  the garos face lost its haunted look
he at once broke into excited speech
that was pathetic in its eagerness and

relief the geedur has been seen only
recently he said and he told the
story that dhan had poured from trem-
bling lips shaidullah listened keeping
from his face the pity and partial in-
credulity that he felt

  when the tale was finished he walked
back to his master and related what he
had heard they talk of a twenty-
foot tiger who bears a monkey astride
his shoulders sahib he has been seen
in the forest not far from here and
they say that three children have been
carried off and eaten in the last five
days they are so frightened thinking
that the monkey must be hanuman him-
self god of the monkeys who has
trained this bagh to bear him through
the jungle he laughed but it will
be a good hunt

  what the devil does all that rigma-
role mean shaidullah tudor asked
irritably his lean face drawn into a
perplexed frown

  kya jane sahib who knows 
the shikari shrugged his shoulders a
lie perhaps but the tiger has been seen
we can count on that and they will
guide us to the spot

  tudors eyes startlingly blue against
the deep tan of his skin gleamed with
excitement he passed the tips of his
slim fingers nervously across his chin
its a wonderful story to bring back
isnt it he exclaimed and he must
be a devilish big brute he directed a
few words of command to his mahout
and then turned again to shaidullah
we must get something to eat and
turn in for the night well need steady
nerves to-morrow

  the next day shortly after tiffin the
elephants started off for the jungle
tudors sun helmet gleamed brightly
over his eager face one hand rested
on the edge of the howdah the other
was clenched around the barrel of his
rifle the villagers came outside of the
stockade and watched wistfully with
a despairing prayer in their eyes until

pop-b
swamp tiger



the dark-gray beasts with their swaying
howdahs had disappeared among the
trees

  the sun was still high when vagra
left the cool protection of his nurkul
swamp for the hot atmosphere of
the glade beyond now and then muni
slipped from his shoulder and ran along
beside him on all fours before clam-
bering back on again once he sprang
too far and vagra waited patiently until
the slight pressure on his back told him
that muni was safe again

  it was an undeniable urge that had
made vagra quit his marsh one that
he could no longer resist the roar
now familiar and enraging to him had
sounded this noon nearer than ever be-
fore as he trotted along an intermit-
tent rumble seemed ever closer until a
faint scent which he had almost for-
gotten came vaguely to his nostrils he
paused one foot off the ground and
then went forward at a faster pace

  he broke into the jungle now growl-
ing deep in his throat muni began to
fidget and look unhappy vagra inter-
rupted his angry snarling with an en-
couraging twitter before hurrying
through a mass of thorns choked with
twining creepers he came to a small
clearing

  on the other side of this open space
stood a tiger of proportions that over-
shadowed vagras vagras hair bris-
tled into a fluffy ridge from neck to
tail when he saw what this interloper
was gouging at with his fangs this
was vagras second encounter with man
but now he had no fear

  the tiger his muzzle stained red
looked up from the half-devoured body
of a child vagra answered his throaty
growl with a low snarl of sheer fury
his tail stiffened to the stripe at its end
then lashed from side to side as his back
arched slightly at his shoulders muni
ran screaming to the nearest tree and
rushed up its trunk to a high branch

 pop-b

on his face was an expression of ago-
nized fear nearly as frantic as that day
when he had seen sarpan stalking
vagra

  the two animals stood looking each
other full in the eyes each snarling
viciously then as though at a signal
they rushed madly forward fangs
bared as they met vagra lashed out
toward the others throat his claws
ripped into thick hide but missed the
pulsing artery at which he had aimed
he felt the cruel pain of teeth meeting
in his shoulder and wrenched violently
away a patch of bright crimson
stained his leg

  they drew back and again rushed
forward this time they met head to
head fangs meeting fangs they reared
up to their hind legs and their chests
met all the time vagra strove to bury
his fangs in his enemys throat but at
each slash he found only fur not once
did he get to the flesh beneath as they
stood there straining and uttering deep
roars of pain and rage their unsheathed
claws raked each other on back and
sides

  then with a lightning spring vagra
leaped to one side and brought hisspaw
with all the strength in his powerfully
muscled shoulder across his adversarys
back it had force enough to break the
spine of a bison it broke the tigers
back sharply just above his hind legs
his hind quarters collapsed grotesquely
but still he dragged himself on with his
weakening forelegs

  the struggle could last but little
longer vagra attacked from the side
evading the faltering blow that tried to
ward him off he snk his teeth deep
into the beasts throat he kept them
there until the body beneath his grew
limp and dead then he shook himself
and sank wearily to the grass his tongue
lolling out

  chattering shrill excitement muni
came down from his tree and ran hesi-
tantly over to his friend vagras eyes


the popular magazine

brightened through their weariness and
he stretched out a soft paw muni
rubbed his tiny hand over it curiously
before retreating a few feet to jump
up and down on his hind legs still voic-
ing his excitement an ingratiating
pur from vagras throat brought him
back

  when he was completely rested vagra
got to his feet fixed his teeth in the
dead beasts shoulder and dragged him
slowly toward his marsh it was a
grinding task he ached in every inch
of his body when he at last arrived at
the swamp the slain tiger still dragging
from his mouth once there he kept on
out to a place where the mud was soft
and deep below the shallow water
vagra kept to a long hummock of firm
ground the body trailing beside him in
the greenish water he left his burden
half submerged and went back to the
shade of the tamarind that bore the
marks of his claws

  secure from the sun he and muni
sat side by side watching quietly until
the tawny black-striped body of the
man eater had been sucked down into
the muck watching until the water
closed completely over it

  the peace that should have been his
now that the interloper in his domain
had been destroyed was never granted
to vagra at the moment when he was
ready to sleep off his weariness and pain
the shrill trumpeting of an elephant
broke into the still air and very
faintly he could hear a heavy tread com-
ing through the reeds from the direc-
tion of the savanna

  he had heard wild elephants before
though never in his marsh but this
was different the tread was too meas-
ured there was too little trumpeting
this was something which made him
growl unhappily muni jumped to his
shoulder moaning in a frightened way

  they took cover in the high grass
where vagra crouched down very still
the sound came nearer he penetrated

deeper into the reeds as much as pos-
sible away from the approaching enemy
then rose high into the air the sharp
scream of an elephant when it scents a
tiger and above that came to vagras
ears a new sound the mahouts were
screaming and yelling in their attempt
to keep their beasts in order

  vagra padded through the nurkul
toward the glade directly in front of
him an elephant trumpeted he could
see the grass waving violently and
started to retreat back to the pool
again he was halted the line of ele-
phants had cut him off there was only
one course left he made for the end
of the glade escaping through the open
part of the half circle that the hunters
had formed around him as he broke
into a gallop the elephants came hard
on his heels he reached the open with
a scant fifty yards between him and his
pursuers

  when tudor who was on the leading
elephant caught sight of vagra with
muni clinging desperately to his shoul-
der he yelled to shaidullah who was
close behind theres the filthy brute
by god monkey and all his muzzles
still a bloody mess hes eaten-

  the final word was drowned out by
the report of his gun his elephant
lurched as he fired sending the shot
high

  vagra stopped dead at the report
frozen in his tracks by the horribly un-
expected sound there was a squeal of
pain and something slipped convulsively
from his back he looked down and
saw muni his eyes opened wide in a
piteous appeal his long black tail
straightened out in a manner patheti-
cally unlike that in which it had been
flaunted through the forest the eyes
dimmed and then lost all vestige of life
muni lay limply still

  tudor working his hands with grim
haste had slipped another cartridge into
the chamber of his rifle bracing him-
self against the swaying of the howdah
swamp tiger



he took quick aim when vagras
striped neck stood above the ivory bead
of his front sight his finger contracted

  there was another explosion and
vagra felt a burning pain in his shoul-
der overwhelmed with pain and be-
wilderment he might have fled but
muni the only creature toward whom
he had felt affection since cubhood the
only friend he had ever known lay dead
the outstretched silvery body still lay
before him and the elephant bearing
in its howdah the creature that meant
only misery to vagra was nearly upon
him

   his chest burning with red fury he
sprang toward the elephant and met his
rush with a leap that carried him ten
feet into the air straight to the ele-
phants head at this move the other
beasts turned and rushed from the scene
vagra dug his claws into the she-ele-
phants trunk fastened the claws of
his forepaws deep into her ears strug-
gling to pull himself on top of her she
trumpeted and rocked from side to side
in pain but held her ground

  the mahout beat vagra over the
head with his goad still vagra clung
tenaciously to his position tudor had
all he could do to keep from being
pitched out of the howdah his set face
was white his eyes staring at any
moment the girths might break and he
would be thrown helplessly to the
ground where he might be trampled to
death by the maddened beast

  the elephant could bear the agony
no longer she made off at a gallop
straight for the trunk of a tamarind
if she was successful she could rub off
or crush her tormenter before he
slashed her head to pieces the mahout
threw himself to the ground willing to
risk immediate death rather than what
might follow

   vagra suddenly felt a stunning im-
pact against his back then with a

crash the tamarind broke off at its base
the elephant staggered blindly forward
found its footing give way without
warning and was precipitated into a ra-
vine with almost perpendicular banks
fifteen feet deep tudor was shot from
the howdah over vagras head he lay
unconscious his blond hair falling over
his forehead in the dried grass at the
bottom of the ravine

   in the midst of a screaming flood of
roars and screeches vagra staggered to
his feet and sprang out of the way of
the elephants flailing feet he took a
short run and shot into the air toward
the edge of the ravine the claws of his
hind feet bit into the clay sending down
a shower of rattling stones a short
struggle and he was on his feet and
into the jungle

  when he got to the savanna it was
deserted except for the mahout who
was rubbing his injured limbs and the
limp silvery body lying clear against
the fresh brilliance of the grass the
mahout yelled in terror but vagra
passed by him 

  very gently he took munis body in
his mouth careful that his fangs held
him only lightly the mahout watched
them spellbound and wondered if his
master too had strangely escaped with
his life-and why he couldnt know
that sudden despair had made vagra
quit the struggle leaving behind him the
motionless body of tudor to return to
muni his lips moving soundlessly he
watched until they reached the shadow
of the trees

  there vagra stopped and turned his
gaze across the glade toward the nurkul
marsh where there could never again
be any peace for him he slipped
quietly through a clump of bright green
fern and disappeared into the twilight
of the forest a kite flying in sweeping
circles high overhead screamed shrilly
there was no answer

ben lowenstein comes bach in a new ribtichler

glancing through the pages of
the trade magazine ben lowen-
stein of the lowenstein skirt 
blouse co suddenly came upon and
stared at an unpleasant caption

the sam weinberg company in
unique offering

  the sight of the name of his hated
competitor in sizable type on the social
page was in itself enough to spoil his
day for him but the item beneath it
completed the work of destruction

   here is good news that will interest all
w w buyers the sam weinberg company
-the house of values-widely known for
its high-class line of womens and misses
skirts and blouses announces that it will hold
a wonderful fashion show on the evening of

ful live models out-of-town buyers

by all see advertisement on page 

  ben was reading this for the third
time following the lines with a shak-
ing forefinger when his friend sidney
soloman entered the office

  well ben sidney sang out to
bens bent back its lunch time

ben swung around in his swivel chair

  phooee he returned sourly how
could anybody think about eating

  i dont know what you mean by
that sidney replied puzzled when
it comes lunch time you think about
eating aint it

  not when you just got through read-
ing something like this said ben hold-
ing up the magazine

  sidneys face was a living question
mark especially his nose

  still i couldnt understand thats
a paper i read all the time and i eat
anyhoe

  it aint the paper which does it
ben explained its what it says about
sam weinberg read it sidney
sidney read and having finished
looked up with a long shrug

this aint nothing new to me ben
everybody is talking abou it already
only yesterday i met on the street sol
levinson and even he mentioned it
ail ben groaned sol levinson
bread on the water



of the apex sports apparel shops
this is terrible here i been thinking
how i could get his wonderful account
sidney and now you turn around and
tell me how he is talking about wein-
bergs fashion show its like you are
sticking knives in me sidney

  i am sorry i am like sticking knives
in you ben said sidney coolly but
when you practicly ask me yunder-
stand i tell you and thats all there is
to it

  am i blaming you sidney you
dont got to go to work and look so
insulted like i called you something
all i know is this according to what
this paper says weinberg is giving a
fashion show on beautiful live models
yet and according to what you say
even sol levinson is talking about it
i could put two and two together when
i see it it means how weinberg is out
after atl the big accounts

  sure he is he is in business aint
he so nacherly he goes out after the
big accounts he is spending out big
also ben for advertising for this sea-
son alone yunderstand he puts out a
six-thousand-dollar appropillation for
advertising mark summerfield the
advertising man handles it for him
three thousand for the ads in the pa-
pers with the extra write-ups which
summerfield gets for him free-and at
least three thousand for the fashion
show

  six thousand ben gasped

  sure but if it gets him wonderful
accounts like sol levinson ben aint
it worth it  a fashion show he added
earnestly is a wonderful way to get
business in the first place it shows
off the line like nothing else could do it
a piece of merchandise looks different
on a show table and on a beautiful girl
aint it

  well sure blouses and skirts is
made for girls not for show tables
so-

  and besides sidney went on you

got there all the big buyers giving a
look then you serve maybe ice cream
and cake or coffee and sandwiches and
it ends up like a wonderful party with
all the buyers in a good humor and
ready to give out big orders dont you
see how it goes

  i see how it goes all right but
listen once till i tell you how it stands
with me

  forthwith into sidneys sympathetic
ear he poured a lengthy resume of his
troubles in preparation for a prom-
ising season he had completed a line
of skirts and blouses which in number
of styles and expense of production
outdid any previous seasonal effort to
finance this extensive manufacture he
had borrowed money to the very limit
of his resources

  so what could i do sidney i
couldnt go to mark summerfield and
tell him he should put over for me ex-
pensive things like fashion shows and
so forth when i aint got the money to
do it and couldnt borrow it even
and if i dont do it i wouldnt get or-
ders for my wonderful line this season
and when my notes comes due i would
be rooned and thats the way i got
it

  sidneys tongue tapped the roof of
his mouth

  if thats the way you got it ben
then i feel sorry for you from the bot-
tom of my heart

  well ben returned you could go
ahead and be sorry sidney because
thats the way i got it only one hope i
got this season i got a line which you
couldnt equal it nowheres else some
numbers i got is such knock-outs yun-
derstand which only a genius like my
designer irving newman could turn
it out at all and thats my hope

  i see said sidney but have you
got enough hope to come with me by
the l and k restaurant for something
to eat ben because i am getting
hungry


the popular magazine

  ben shook his head with the ex-
citement i got already i would only eat
something very light ill go down by
the dairy lunch

  ben ate alone therefore in the dairy
lunch confining his dietary efforts to
two liverwurst sandwiches with russian
rye some coleslaw a dill pickle in gar-
lic a thick slice of cheese cake and two
cups of coffee when he returned to
his office heavy spiritually and intestin-
ally he found awaiting him none other
than irving newman his designer irv-
ings state of excitement was so mani-
fest that ben sensed calamity before he
heard about it

  nu he cried whats the mat-
ter

  enough returned the designer
with a grim flourish of the hand i
just heard something which if you hear
it mr lowenstein it will make you
drop over

  ben sank quickly into his chair as if
as a precaution against falling any
farther than necessary

  what do you mean irving tell
me quick before i drop over without
hearing it even

  irving strode furiously up and down
the office grinding his teeth and shak-
ing a fist at an invisible foe who seemed
to be hovering somewhere on the ceil-
ing

  is he a thief he shouted is he a
low-life bloodsucker crook
who ben queried weakly for
gods sakes irving who is it like
that

  irving stopped his frantic pacing
weinberg he declared sam
weinberg just to-day i heard about
it my best numbers mr lowenstein
the styles i stayed up at nights to get
inspiration for them that blouse style
no -m that wonderful model
no -b three skirt leaders-even
no -k in pearl-gray and aqua-blue
ach gott ben gasped you dont
mean to told me-

  stolen affirmed irving all our
best and most orignal styles wein-
berg has got them all in his line this
season the very i-den-tickle numbers
how he got them i dont know my
drawings i keep locked up in the safe
like they was jools mr lowenstein
from the workroom here they must
have leaked out

  ben held his whirling head between
tightly pressed palms for a moment
he sat there a study in utter despair
when irving renewed his pacing hurl-
ing imprecations at the inoffensive ceil-
ing ben said wearily

  please irving if you got no more
to tell me get out now and leave me
think its a terrible thing but you
cant get nowhere by busting up this
here office also on the way out
please tell miss josephs she should bring
me in a glass bicarbnate soda its
like i ett rocks for lunch

  the dosage served to clear somewhat
both his chest and his brain in the
light of newmans tidings weinbergs
impending fashion show took on an even
graver aspect ben realized that he
must meet not only warm competition
but duplicity of the rankest sort

  it was not the first time the un-
scrupulous weinberg had managed to
appropriate the choicest style creations
of the high-salaried newman but this
time the plagiarism threatened sheer
disaster the more or less official
opening of the spring season was to
be on monday march th over the
preceding week-end the buyers would
congregate in new york from all parts
of the country

  a majority of them would in all
probability attend the fashion show
which weinberg would hold on the eve-
ning of march th and this meant
that weinberg would be the first to
reveal to the trade the very line of
merchandise upon which ben had
pinned his highest hopes

  its terrible ben pondered miser-
bread on the water



ably something is got to be done or
this time weinberg would positively
roon me

   it was one matter to decide that some-
thing must be done and another matter
to determine what that something should
be after an hour of almost painful
consideration he reached a conclusion
which was in itself simple enough but
which existing conditions made exceed-
ingly complex

  his first move was to visit sidney
soloman whose cloak-and-suit establish-
ment was  a lower floor of the same
building

  sidney he declared after inform-
ing the other of the nefarious theft per-
petrated by weinberg what i got to
do is give a fashion show before wein-
berg gives one i aint got the money i
am borrowed up at the bank but i got
to give it anyhoe

   sidney shook his head dolefully

  a good chance you got ben in
the first place if you couldnt borrow
money from the bank you couldnt bor-
row no place because nobody but the
bank ha got any money to loan out at
the beginning of the season in the
second place you couldnt put over a
thing like that by yourself you would
have to have a feller like mark sum-
merfield to arrange it up and advertise
it and so forth and you know as well
as i do ben how mark summerfield
is strictly cash in advance and in
the third place even if you got the
money and you got summerfield also
even then it wouldnt do you no good
because ben you would got to give
your show before weinberg gives his
aint it and weinberg is giving his
on the tenth march its only on the
eighth and ninth that the buyers would
come to town at all

  then whats the matter with the
eighth and ninth

  sidney gave a short laugh whats
the matter with it they aint noth-
ing the matter with it i assure you

but where would you give such a show
excepting at federmans hall there
they got a fine stage and lots of seats
and any place else with everything just
as good would take a millionaire ben
to handle it and you couldnt get a
day or night at federmans hall until
the end of march at the earliest i
know because federman hisself told me
how he is booked up solid

   ben listened to this death knell of his
hopes and wiped cool perspiration from
his face

  then i am a goner sidney

  well things aint eggzackly wonder-
ful with you-- sidney agreed

  when ben returned that evening to
his apartment in the de luxe he was
as void of hope as madam godiva was
of skirts and blouses disaster had
tackled him hard and now having
thrown him sat firmly astride his back
what delightful visions had possessed
his mind when three months ago he
and the artistic irving newman had
planned the spring line of lowenstein
merchandise

  with what joy had he inspected the
fruits of irvings genius with what
confidence had he gone ahead with pro-
duction  and now-everything wiped
away with one fell stroke the luscious
account of sol levinson for the pros-
perous apex shops the favorable no-
tice of the big buyers from the great
open spaces all about to be herded into
the camp of the enemy

  shortly after he and his wife clara
had left the dinner table they received
a visit from bens widowed sister sarah
rabiner sarah floated in on a flood of
tears

  such troubles was her shrill greet-
ing morton lost his job

  even before she elaborated upon this
simple declaration ben realized its
gravity morton was sarahs only son
and her sole support ben was her
nearest and most prosperous relative
he knew that although this was not the


the popular magazine

end of a perfect day it was a perfect
end to this kind of a day

  such a grand job it was sarah
went on wringing her hands in a sort
of ecstasy of grief you know ben
he was by stein  stein the teatrical
producers sixty dollars a week he
was getting and doing wonderful work
for them which they was pleased and

told him so and now-

  then what did they fire him for
asked ben

  sarah bristled they didnt fire
him why do you say they fired my
morton ben what happened was the
firm went busted ben 

  oh said ben still i dont see
what you want i should do about it
sarah its too bad its terrible even
but all i can see is how morton should
go get him another job right away
yo its easy to talk ben but
are jobs like that laying around in the
street ben all week he tries to get
him another job but everybody says
nothing till next fall till next fall
ben by that time we would be dead in
our graves from starvation already
its terrible put in clara on the
verge of tears such a grand boy too
so handsome a hard worker always

so good to his mamma he-

  wait clara ben snapped you
talk like he was dead already sarah
what was morton doing by that firm he
was with

  well for one thing he got up the

dance ensembles-

  oh he designed ladies underwear

i didnt know he-

  what are you talking about ben
cried sarah did i say anything about
ladies underwear i said he got up
the dance ensembles for the stein 
stein musical shows also he stage di-
rected a little and-

  you know what wonderful talent
morton has got interposed clara i
remember even when he was little he
used to write nice verses and songs and

so forth also he can sing and dance
and he is handsome like in the movies

  is he handsome said sarah clasp-
ing her hands and raising her face to the
ceiling he is beautiful clara aint
it all the girls is so crazy about him
i always think-

  shush ben cried impatiently
would you two women please for a
favor go in the other room and talk
like that  i got a hard day to-day and
i dont feel like listening to such
schmoos if he is so handsome which
all the girls want him let him go to
work and marry a rich girl and he
wont need a job and anyways what
do you want i should do about it

  i thought you could give him a job
from now till next fall ben sarah
told him tearfully after all he is
your own sisters child he is your own
flesh and blood aint blood thicker
than water ben

  you bet its thicker ben snorted
i should give him a job yet what
are you talking about sarah am i
in the skirt-and-blouse business or not
sarah can i give him a job he should
sing and dance and look beautiful in
the shipping department  or should he
teach me dance ensembles you talk
crazy

  this preluded an hour of violent
argument in which sarah and clara
stood shoulder to shoulder against ben
morton it appeared was an all-around
genius his business ability was second
only to his artistic gifts he was as ef-
ficient as though he were not as hand-
some as a movie star

  but this evening all argument all
sisterly and wifely pressure were lost
upon ben he was for once in his
life adamant in matters of flesh and
blood he had plenty of valid argu-
ments himself he was on the precipice
that beetles financial ruin

  no no no he shouted shut
up and get out of here i got enough
without this you are driving me
bread on the water



meschuga with it i said i couldnt
give morton a job and i mean what i
said and thats the end

  sarah departed as she had arrived-
the flood of her tears bore her in a
lachrymal ebb tide carried her away
clara-morton being her favorite
nephew-valiantly carried on a verbal
barrage until ben was in bed with the
pillow wrapped across his ears

  such a day he groaned as he
sank into the slumber of sheer ex-
haustion i would be better off if i
didnt wake up at all to-morrow

  he did awake however to a clear
crisp february morning with yester-
days memories bitter on his tongue
nor had clara forgotten ben left his
home with claras renewed recrimina-
tions ringing in his ears and stabbing
his conscience flesh and blood he
wouldnt even help his own flesh and
blood

  what could i do he asked him-
self later as he sat in his office mor-
ton is a grand boy all right but what
good would he do me here when i
am nilly rooned is that a time to hire
anybody even a relation

  at eleven oclock he received a visit
from dave raskopf treasurer of the
united kishnev brotherhood lodge
no  of which ben was president mr
raskopf fitted perfectly into the atmos-
phere and mood of the office he was
weightily lugubrious

  i tell you ben he said sadly
things is in a terrible shape the
u k b charities fund is practicly
wiped out its enough we could just
meet the expenses for the old folks
home and the orphan asylum but for
the mitzvah milk station ben we aint
got a nickel on the fifteenth march we
are supposed to get started with the sta-
tion and begin to give out milk and ice
to the needy could we do it ben
without money i ask you

  ai ben groaned now i got to
worry also about milk and ice

  you are president of the lodge
ben raskopf reminded reprovingly
then you are also president of the
united charities aint it if you and
me dont worry about it who would
could we let sweet babies die in the
gutter have you got a heart in you
ben or a stone

  stop ben pleaded do you want
i should bust down and cry here did
i say i aint sorry for them poor chil-
dren like that  all i ask is you should
leave me think a minute

  raskopf fell silent and ben walked
to the window staring out at the wall
of the building across the street after
five minutes of deep concentration he
turned suddenly to his somewhat dis-
couraged visitor

  what you better do dave is to call
up a big meeting for next sunday night
be sure you get all the board of direc-
tors and as many members as you could
get then well see what we could do
about it if babies need milk they got
to get milk also ice

 raskopf rose and gripped bens
plump hand

  ben you got a heart as big as a
watermelon

  forget it dave charity is charity
also ben told himself a while
later charity begins at home mor-
ton is my own sisters child my own
flesh and blood i got to do what is
right by them no matter what

  he telephoned to clara

  dolling he said please for a fa-
vor dont be mad at me no more i
changed my mind about what i said
last night call up for me sarah and
tell her she should send morton around
here right away to-day ill find some-
thing for him to do and pay him sixty
dollars a week

ben clara replied joyfully i
knew your heart would melt just for
that to-night i would make special for
you for dinner some fine rinderbrust
never mind that clara he re-


the popular magazine

turned maybe babies would get milk
and ice and morton would get a job
but myself i am in no condition for
rinderbrust

  whatever alarm treasurer raskopf
sounded the members of the u k b
responded nobly to a noble cause of
course there were a few came under
the misapprehension that there would
be some sort of gratuitous entertain-
ment  but most of them realized how-
ever vaguely that some grave situation
had arisen which needed their instant
attention

  not one of the board of directors was
absent sam weinberg bens bitter
personal and commercial foe but a co-
worker in the affairs of the brother-
hood morry jacobson flowers and
feathers mark summerfield the ad-
vertising man phil strauss of the
elite catering co sol levinson of the
apex stores ike federman real
estate aaron weil wholesale poultry
and besides these leaders at least fifty
lesser lights among the membership
were in attendance

  after they had assembled in the spa-
cious room on the second floor treas-
urer raskopf took the floor and with
moving eloquence explained the sad cir-
cumstances which prompted this meet-
ing when he finished the room was
staccato with clucking tongues poor
orphans poor babies no milk no
ice schlemazel

  then ben rose and spoke as presi-
dent ben was ordinarily no orator
but to-night he seemed inspired if
raskopf set his hearers tongues to tap-
ping ben brought real tears to their
eyes he painted so vivid a picture of
milkless and iceless babies that the walls
seemed to echo their infantile wails of
agony

  i tell you he pursued earnestly
something is got to be done about it
like brother raskopf told you on the
fifteenth march the mitzvah milk sta-
tion gets started for the summer by

that time we got to have five thousand
dollars cash in the fund to do it if
we dont do it and even one little inno-
cent baby dies without milk and ice
then all i got to say is it would be ter-
rible so what i am going to do now
is to ask for suggestions from anybody
which they got something they could
suggest

  suggestions were forthcoming but
for the most part they were impractical
for example mendel rabinowitz-who
by the way represented a live-stock
company-proposed that they buy a
dozen cows

  in that way he concluded you
would not alone get milk this summer
but every summer as long as the cows
lived and a good cow lives a long
time

  you maybe got good intentions
overruled the president but the idea
is meschuga in the first place if you
keep a dozen cows in a little store on
hester street like the milk station is
then all i got to say is you are a won-
der rabinowitz even so it would
solve up only one half of the problem
because maybe you sell cows which give
out not only milk but ice also but my-
self i never heard of it who else has
got ideas to give 

  how about a charity bazaar asked
morry jacobson rising to the occasion
the last bazaar we give made enough
to pay off the mortgage on this build-
ing is that a idea

  morry ben replied thats a won-
derful idea still it wont do you
cant expect to give one bazaar after
another and still get people to come
to it people get sick of bazaars the
same as anything else fr instance my
own wife bought enough stuff at the
last bazaar so we still trip over it in our
apartment thats the way it goes with
everybody else before we give another
bazaar we got to wait till everybody
throws away what they bought at the
last one what we want this time is
bread on the water



something diffrent but what you said
morry gives me a wonderful idea
why couldnt we give a fine entertain-
ment with music singing and dancing
aha listen yet right away when
i think about it i am getting excited

  indeed his face was flushed and
eager and he denied eloquence no help-
ful gesticulation a musical produc-
tion would be a novelty tickets could
be sold for five dollars each and it
would be no trick at all to dispose of one
thousand tickets among the six hun-
dred members of the brotherhood

  we could raise five thousand dol-
lars easy and if everybody here helps
whichever way he could then the ex-
pense would be practicly nothing for
the actors aint we got enough fine sons
and daughters to do it myself i think
that brother jacobsons idea is won-
derful

  all faces turned to smile appre-
ciatively at brother jacobson who
grinned modestly beneath his stubby
mustache it was evident from the gen-
eral comment and applause that the sug-
gestion was favorably received but a
formal vote made it a matter of record
the secretary wrote into the minutes
brother jacobson makes a motion a
musical entertainment should be given
by the lodge president lowenstein
seconds motion carried

  now shouted the president we
got to make up final arrangements here
so far all we know is now we would
give a entertainment but putting on
such a fine thing takes somebody to run
it and somebody has got to volunteer to
do it this is a busy season for every-
body in business so whoever does it
has got to make big sacrifices aint
it

  he paused and looked down from his
height on the platform whereas a
moment ago every face was lifted di-
rectly to his own now he saw only
three-quarter profiles the room was
a hubbub of nervously shifting feet

  so who wants to nominate hisself
for chairman of the musical entertain-
ment ben inquired brother sam
weinberg how would you like to do
it

  for a long moment there was silence
fifty pairs of eyes saw weinberg stiffen
in his chair while a dull flush mounted
to his face he glared at ben malevo-
lently in his mind were the thoughts
that came to every one who knew of
the deadly rivalry between the houses
of weinberg and lowenstein why did
ben single him out for this dubious
honor he should take charge of a
charity affair at the opening of the
spring season it would mean neglect-
ing his own business to the advantage
of his competitors and enemies wein-
bergs lips curled a fine chance ben
had of tricking him like that he
would just turn the tables on ben he
rose to his feet

  i guess i ought to be honored by
the honor you would like me to get he
told ben but i am sorry to say how i
got to refuse it at this time there is
somebody right here who aint nilly as
busy as i am who could give their time
to it better than i could it seems to
me lowenstein that if you could get
tears down your cheeks talking about
the babies without milk and ice yun-
derstand then you could make a few
sacrifices also so right now i openly
nominate you lowenstein for chair-
man of the musical entertainment

  they who sat nearest the platform
saw that tiny beads of perspiration
glistened on bens forehead and upper
lip and that a strange fire burned in
his eye they saw him draw a deep
quivering breath before he made his
reply

  so he exclaimed grimly brother
weinberg nominates me for the chair-
man he dont want it hisself because
it means too much sacrifices from his
business to give to them helpless ba-
bies and orphans well all i got to


the popular magazine

say is this i am happy to say that i
have got a heart in me instead of a rock
when starving babies needs me i
couldnt think about myself there-
fore yunderstand i not alone except
the nomination which brother wein-
berg nominated but also i second the
nomination and besides being the
chairman and doing all the work i right
now this minute want to buy the first
hundred tickets for five hundred dollars
now what do you think about that

  they showed him what they thought
about it the room rang with shouts
and cheers and applause of hand and
foot until the crystal chandeliers swayed
ben held up a hand and pleaded for
silence

 brothers of the u k b he
shouted listen once hollering is all
right and i appreciate it from the bot-
tom of my heart how you are acting
but we still got work to do i couldnt
do it all myself even if i wanted to do
it in the first place would every man
here which he has got a on or a daugh-
ter or some young relation like that
please see how they would take a part in
this entertainment 

  the chandeliers swayed again with
their affirmative replies

 so far so good now another
thing we got to give this here enter-
tainment as soon as possible a good
time to give it is on a sunday night
like brother jacobson says its sun-
day night which it is most convenience
for everybody brother jacobson
about how long do you think it would
take us to get everything ready with
rehearsing and so forth about four
weeks 

  i think four weeks would be all
right replied brother jacobson

  well then ben went on hurriedly
suppose we say four weeks from to-
night brother fishbein-he turned
to the secretary--what date would that
come on 

  brother fishbein counted on his

fingers that would be the ninth of
march

  so brother fishbein makes a mo-
tion we would-make the date for the
entertainment on sunday the ninth of
march who seconds it brother
goldstein seconds it all in favor
please holler aye motion is carried

  now the next problem we got is
where to give it at since we would
sell a thousand tickets and got only one
performance then we got to have a
place big enough to sit a thousand peo-
ple i want to say right here that be-
sides being chairman and buying tickets
i am also willing to furnish out from
my own pocket a perfessional stage di-
rector to direct this here entertainment
the way its got to be

  more cheers which ben silenced
quickly

  hollering is all right but what i
need here is cooperation i couldnt do
everything myself we got to get a
place to give the entertainment at-
brother federman here is a chance you
could show how big your heart is

  federman was on his feet the light
of sweet charity shining on his round
rosy face

  by golly he cried nothing could
give me greater pleasure yunderstand
i should donate the use of federmans
hall for the poor starving babies and
orphans but in that case we couldnt
have the entertainment until late in
march because so help me until late
in march every day and night the hall
is taken by somebody

  late in march ben echoed in con-
sternation but we got to have the
money before the fifteenth when the
milk station begins no like brother
fishbein says its got to be on march
th

  at the rear of the room a tall thin
man rose to his feet and demanded
recognition

 brother wetzel pointed ben
you got the floor
bread on the water



  i only want to say brother wetzel
declared aggressively how i am will-
ing to make sacrifice also just like any-
body else i am the feller which he
has got federmans hall hired up for
march th i got it for my daughter
milly which we are giving her a com-
ing-out dance for a debut now if its
a question which is more importance
my daughter coming out in a debut or
a lot of starving orphans and babies
then all i got to say is my wife should
raise a rumpus about persponing the
dance a few weeks

  is that a wonderful spirit cried
ben brother wetzel is willing to give
up his date so brother federman could
donate his hall on march th if you
think that aint sacrifice then you never
had a wife and daughter who would
have something to say when they heard
about it but you could tell your milly
brother wetzel how i would give her
a nice part in the entertainment that
would make her feel good and satisfy
your wife also

  brother wetzel seated himself amid
cheers

  now we are getting along here
beamed the delighted president and
chairman brother wetzel makes a
motion we use federmans hall for the
entertainment motion seconded by
brother federman who donates the
hall donation accepted with apprecia-
tion and the motion is carried write
it down in the minutes brother fish-
bein

  an hour later the meeting was ad-
journed long after the room was
emptied of its human occupants char-
ity benevolence and philanthropy hov-
ered about shaking hands and patting
each other on the back for they had
reason to feel that honor had been paid
them and they had done a good
evenings work

  brother summerfield had somehow
been elected publicity manager he
would see to it that the entertainment

would be given the widest possible pub-
licity through the newspapers the trade
journals and circulars to be prepared
and printed at his own expense he
would also furnish the tickets and pro-
grams and the entire organization of
his advertising agency would be at the
disposal of the entertainment commit-
tee phil strauss of the elite catering
co promised to furnish ice cream
cakes and sandwiches to be served after
the conclusion of the performance

  i tell you sidney ben remarked to
his friend as the two walked together to
the subway the way everybody re-
sponded was wonderful

  sure sidney replied but just
the same ben you are the only sucker
everybody else makes this donation or
that donation and thats all but you
ben got to do all the work you let
sam weinberg trap you into it right
now when you ought to give every min-
ute to your business you take up some-
thing like this dont you know it
would use up nilly all your time for
the next four weeks

  that is something i couldnt help
sidney ben returned somebody is
got to do it when babies need milk
they need milk and thats all there is to
it if you dont do good in this world
then you suffer for it but if you do
good then you get rewarded you
know what the book says sidney if
you throw bread in the water you get
it back pretty quick and if this is
milk and ice instead of bread its the
same thing

  it was rather fortunate after all that
ben had given employment to his tal-
ented nephew morton rabiner mor-
tons knowledge of theatrical produc-
tion his ability as composer writer vo-
calist and dancer were not of much
use in the manufacture and sale of
skirts and blouses but to the chairman
of the entertainment committee he was
certainly the knock of opportunity

  on monday morning ben and mor-


the popular magazine

ton held a long conference morton
was delighted with his new and more
congenial assignment

  im glad you are glad said ben
it gives you something to do for your
salary besides just hanging around here
and keeping the womens minds off of
their work you are too good-looking
morton for a busy place where women
is supposed to be working i dont see
why a heart-buster like you dont find
for hisself a fine rich girl and get mar-
ried and settled down

  morton flashed a set of dentifrice-ad-
vertisement teeth

  im still looking uncle ben

  well the sooner you do it the better
off everybody would be and now we
got to get to work right away on the
entertainment how do we begin it
morton 

  the first thing is to get our talent
together have try-outs select the
principals and chorus then when i
see what ive got to work on ill write
the show and start rehearsals you
leave it all to me

  ill leave most of it to you ben
replied but not all we got to work
together on this

  indeed ben proved during the ensu-
ing weeks that he was no slacker he
did not shift the burden of responsi-
bility to his nephews shoulders if the
chairmanship entailed the sacrifice of
his attention to his business he seemed
willing to make that sacrifice

  i tell you sidney soloman remon-
strated whenever he managed to catch a
glimpse of his furiously busy friend i
tell you ben you are acting like a fool
you aint hardly in your office no more
you are letting your business go to the
dawgs

  can i help it ben replied you
dont know how much work you got to
do to make up a grand entertainment
like this would be last week it was
picking out the cast nilly a hundred
girls we had to listen to them sing and

watch them dance one gets picked for
the leading lady some gets picked for
other parts and the rest goes into the
chorus

  a fine thing said sidney gloom-
ily more trouble for you ben you
pick one for leading lady yunderstand
and the papas of the others gets jealous
with you

  i know ben agreed thats why
i wouldnt let morton do the picking
alone by hisself i had to be careful
who got picked but now its all done
and everything is fine and everybody is
satisfied like morton said it was
strickly on the merit basis well i got
to hurry away now sidney i got to go
see summerfield about some more pub-
licity did you see already the pub-
licity in the trade papers and so forth
its wonderful how summerfield could
do it

  ten days before the performance
every one of the thousand tickets had
been sold with treasurer raskopf de-
posited five thousand dollars for the
mitzvah milk and ice fund now ben
was able to turn over the reins to mor-
tons capable hands and his business
establishment knew him once more

  george nussholz buyer of womens
wear for the emporium davenport
iowa arrived in new york city fri-
day morning accompanied by the as-
sistant buyer harry getzburg and
registered at the astor hotel their ar-
rival was duly noted in the newspapers
of friday evening and saturday morn-
ing on saturday afternoon the hotel
mail clerk handed nussholz a letter it
read as follows

  dear mr nussholz inclosed please find
with my compliments two tickets worth five
dollars  each a ticket for good seats
for the wonderful mitzvah milk and ice fund
entertainment given-by the united kishnev
brotherhood lodge no  this will cost
you positively nothing and the entertainment
will be something wonderful with a hun-
dred beautiful girls singing danc-
ing and acting afterward it would be served
bread on the water



fine refreshments free of charge and maybe
dancing if the seats could be cleaned away in
time i guess you read all about this enter-
tainment in the trade papers so you will be
anxious to get there especially since it wont
cost you a cent come and meet all your
friends there with best regards

      yours truly

ben lowenstein

  nussholz examined the tickets and
noted the date sunday evening march
th the big theaters he remembered
were closed in new york on sundays
he and his assistant decided to use the
tickets

  accordingly they presented them-
selves at federmans hall the following
evening five minutes before the rise of
the curtain and were ushered to seats
in the fourth row center here they
found themselves among friends they
recognized their immediate neighbors
in the first six or seven rows as fellow
buyers from various sections of the
country why theres charlie cohn
of the grand leader seattle hello
charlie how do rosenheim when
did you get in new york yesterday
morning we got in friday hows
business in toledo

  it was all very pleasant jovial and
noisy waiting for the entertainment to
start joe shreibers orchestra-do-
nated by brother joe schreiber-was
already performing in the name of char-
ity  but against the din of a thousand
greeting laughing gossiping shouting
voices the music could not be heard
there would be plenty of music later
on now was the time for comment

  hello mrs rebman umm-what
a stunning dress you got on is it
new 

  say lollie did you seen hannah
lederer yet to-night  shes got on that
new dimond lavooleer her husband give

a musical extravaganza with
gertrude levinson
and

morton rabiner
and

an all-star cast including
ninety-six beautiful girls

words and music
by

morton rabiner
staged by morton rabiner

  the lowering of the lights in the
auditorium was the signal for silence
and attention now shreibers or-
chestra was heard playing the clos-
ing chords of a fifteen-minute overture
a crash of cymbals a roll of drums
a last long blast of trumpets the walls
shivered with applause then the
orchestra began anew and slowly the
curtain rose

  the first and only scene of this ex-
travaganza was the program explained
a garden in spain it is quite likely
that mortons hispanic inspiration rose
from the fact that brother julius levy
of the eastern storage co happened
to have one stage set in the warehouse
-a garden in spain at least it was
decided that it represented a garden in
spain though actually it was designed
to portray a patio in los angeles

 the backdrop was a somewhat
cracked and faded ocean which no
doubt inspired mortons colorful num-
ber for i am a spanish sailor
morton as don pizzani was indeed a
spanish sailor in fact until just before
the fallof the final curtain he was
thought to be a spanish pirate for-
tunately he wasnt a pirate at all but
one of the kings most trusted prohibi-


the popular magazine

tion-enforcement officers a captain no
less

  the reason for his disguise was that
he must not only deceive one thousand
spectators who had donated five dollars
each to the mitzvah milk and ice fund
but also senorita rose-gertrude lev-
inson-who loved him from the mo-
ment she laid dark eyes upon him in
the opening chorus but couldnt marry
him until during the closing chorus
she discovered that he was not a pirate

  as pirate or captain morton was a
dashing handsome heart-fluttering
hero as for gertrude she was as
lovely as dainty as beautiful a senorita
as ever danced behind the footlights
even mrs elkus whose daughter was
in the chorus-mr elkus was in the
iron business-could not help admitting
that and mr and mrs sol levinson
in the eleventh row were fairly swoon-
ing with pride

  it was a most appreciative enthusi-
astic audience each effort was greeted
with a burst of approval that threat-
ened the very foundations of feder-
mans hall but when the curtain fell
on the closing scene discreetly screen-
ing the realistic embrace of don pizsani
and senorita rose-then did the audi-
torium rock with stamping feet and
clashing palms and even cheers and
whistles

  the entire cast took seven bows the
principals took five gertrude and mor-
ton appeared a dozen times holding
hands bowing blowing kisses drop-
ping curtsies there seemed to be no
appeasing the delighted crowd

  then morton ran back into the wings
and fairly dragged out one who had not
hitherto appeared either among the audi-
ence or on the stage it was ben low-
enstein

 speech speech every one
shouted and ben modestly complied

  ladies and gentlemen this is posi-
tively one of the most happy moments
i ever had in my life happier even

to-night was what you could call a
wonderful success  from every angle
because we got the money we needed
for the poor babies milk and ice and
everybody got a grand time in the bar-
gain aint it wait dont holler
till i get finished here it aint me who
should get the hollers for it anyhoe
because the ones who should get the
credit for it is these beautiful young
people which they done it all so won-
derful especially morton rabiner
which he wrote the show and made it
a wonderful success

  now wait still i aint finished i
want to say here how i got two sur-
prises for you i am going to tell you
one surprise and i am going to show
you the other one the entertainment
aint finished yet and when i get
through telling you one of the surprises
we will go on with the rest of the en-
tertainment

  but first i want to make a announce-
ment which i am positive everybody will
be happy to hear it listen now in
behalf from my friends mr and mrs
sol levinson and in behalf also from
my sister mrs rabiner i make the an-
nouncement of the marriage engagement
of miss gertrude levinson and mr
morton rabiner-sholem malechem

  wait wait please wait after-
wards comes the congratulations
everybody keep in the seats the rest
of the entertainment will now com-
mence 

  again the lights were lowered again
the curtain rose for a moment the
spanish garden was deserted but for a
moment only miss gertrude levinson
still blushing prettily tripped lightly
from the wings and stood again at the
center of the stage when the renewed
applause died down she recited the fol-
lowing epic

weve done our best to please you all
who kindly came to federmans hall

we thank you for your kind applause

and that is certainly no apple sauce

but now will come the biggest treat
for any one who has a seat

a fashion show for all to see-

an extra added attraction free

youll see the very latest style

that has all others beat a mile

these styles youll see in the high-class
     houses-

the newest and finest skirts and blouses
sizes from forty-four to fourteen

and offered this spring by ben lowenstein

  ben lowenstein was the cue word
as she uttered it the first of ninety-six
beautiful girls walked upon the stage
she wore a blouse and skirt most be-
comingly and in her hand she carried
a small red-lettered placard

blouse no -m

skirt no -k

  shortly before noon the following
day sidney soloman managed to find
ben alone in his office

  by golly ben he declared i been
trying to see you all morning

  im sorry sidney ben replied i
been so terrible busy i couldnt give you
any time all morning the buyers been
coming in-thank god-to give a look
at my line and place orders

  i got news for you sidney ex-
claimed i heard how sam weinberg
is going around saying how he would
positively sue you or something for
what you done last night he is nilly
crazy

  if he thinks i am worried about him
suing me ben answered calmly then
he is entirely crazy could he sue me
because for four weeks i practicly give
up my business and give all my time
to charity

for a while sidney was silent strok-

ing his lean chin reflectively at last he
spoke

  now i begin to see it

  you begin to see what sidney

  i ought to give you a apology ben
in the beginning i called you a sucker
you should do so much instead you at-
tend to your business now i see it
for one thing you get your nephew
married up with sol levinsons daugh-
ter not alone is morton fixed for life
yunderstand but now you are practicly
flesh-and-blood with sol levinson and
that means you would get his skirt-and-
blouse account for all the national apex
shops

  sure ben nodded i got a won-
derful opening order from him only this
morning

  furthermore went on sidney
you managed to give a fashion show
and show your line to the buyers before
weinberg could do it and for all the
wonderful advertising by summerfield
and for federmans hall and music
and such refreshments and everything
all it cost you was five hundred dollars
for tickets to give out to buyers by

golly ben-

  ben drew himself up with dignity
wait sidney i give that five hun-
dred dollars to charity what i done
was all for charity you could prove it
when you know how the fund has got
five thousand dollars for the mitzvah
milk station the way you talk you
should be ashamed didnt i throw
bread on the water sidney can i
help it if i got it back already it says
in the book throw your bread on the
water it dont say you cant first tie
a string to it does it 

further business adventures of ben and sidney will be heard from soon

tae werewolfs helmet

by edgar l cooper

in six parts-part iii

the story so far

taonald kincaid weclthy young
texan who served with the italian
forces during the war receives a letter
from the marchesa della serravalle ask-
ing him to make a trip to italy and bring
with him an austrian helmet which was
given him as a souvenir by one captain
stendahl when the latter was dying a
girl whose name don later learns is

stephanie graetz and members of a gang
attempt to steal the helmet and fail
don sets out for new york with bob
gaines his indian-negro servant at-
tempts are made on their lives and after
escaping from a gangster attack in new
york don is mystified by the appear-
ance of a friend of the marchesas one
spinelli in the plot

 back numbers are easily procured
the werewolfs helmet



chapter vi continued

spinelli

the insistent ringing of the tele-
phone awoke don kincaid he
sat up in bed scowling scratching
the back of his neck picked up the
phone off the stand by his bed yawned
and grunted a surly all right

  mr kincaid

  yes who is it

  this is spinelli speaking came a
guarded voice im at the hotel and
if it is convenient id like to come up
and see you at once

  oh all right spinelli come on
up ninth floor suite c

  yes i know thank you good-
by

  heavens what a night don mut-
tered then raised his voice in a hey
bob

  the indian-negro appeared in the
corridor doorway his eyes bloodshot
from want of sleep but grimly alert
bob gaines had spent a bad night and
showed it he wore a dressing gown
and both hands were in its pockets

  feel all right this a m grinned
don

   yes sir said bob gaines

  im expecting a caller said don
just keep your eye to the keyhole over
there and your ears open if this
spinelli hombre isnt all he should be
you stand by with your gat ready
savvy and come when i signal
bob gaines nodded and slid into the
service passage softly closing its door
as a knock sounded on the corridor
door don thrust his pistol in the
waistband of his pajamas drew his robe
over it and keeping his body behind
the jamb of the door abruptly opened it
spinelli

   yes sir

  walk in and have a seat

  he was a big man signor spinelli a
grossly fat man his blue-shaven jowls
hung like hog hams over his collar and

his stomach wabbled like a sausage bal-
loon when he walked his eyes were
large and dark his lips thick his nose
like a turnip and his thick black mus-
tache was like a sicilian camorristas
he carefully placed his borsolino hat
upon the table removed a heavy over-
coat-disclosing a fascisti insignia in
his waistcoat lapel-and eased his ele-
phantine bulk into a chair

  well sir its been quite an ad-
venture hasnt it

  his voice was a deep chuckle and his
olive face a mass of wrinkles as he
crossed his pudgy legs and lit a thick
black cigar having first offered one to
kincaid who declined it his eyes
flitted all around the room when he
spoke but never at the person he was
addressing

  quite an adventure is correct said
don dryly and i believe i owe you
a standing vote of thanks for some
timely aid you gave me also my man
last night at least i presume that you
are responsible

  that is so said spinelli i re-
gret that my boys did not pick you up
sooner yesterday afternoon after your
arrival i received a message from the
marchesa della serravalle and being
rather familiar with things here in
nyork i had an idea there might be
some trouble i am sorry that i was
unable to foresee quite all-and pre-
vent it

  thats all in the game shrugged
don watching his visitor narrowly i
suppose you also know that while i was
away last night my room was ran-
sacked very efficiently even the mat-
tresses were cut open

  i didnt know said spinelli hands
on his knees and gazing earnestly
at the radiator but i am not sur-
prised i trust that nothing was stolen
mr kincaid

  no there wasnt and neither i
or my man received injuries in the at-
tempts made upon us but i suppose


the popular magazine

your agents have informed you about
that

  spinelli nodded yes one helped
you to escape from the roost of the
lazzaroni others-ah-attended to a
gangster called jacopo who was reputed
to be clever with a knife there are
many ways of learning things mr kin-
caid yes sir

  don smoked for a moment in silence
he had learned about the ransacking of
his hotel suite and the strangely
thwarted attack upon bob gaines when
he returned after his escape from the
hunchbacks house bob had started to
the hotel after leaving don in front of
the globe theater and was almost at
his destination when a sudden commo-
tion directly behind him took place

  a closed car crawled down the ave-
nue and some twenty feet in his rear a
couple of automatics were thrust
through its doors and spat steady
streams of fire their target was a
skulking pedestrian who was stealthily
inching up behind the indian-negro
and the lethal slugs did not miss

  the man pitched to the sidewalk with
a cry cut short by a mouthful of blood
men shouted and women screamed the
car zoomed ahead and raced swiftly
away and round a corner and the
dead victim police discovered was an
italian who carried a gat in an armpit
holster and an eight-inch knife up his
sleeve minions of law and order put
the slaying down to a gang feud and
let it go at that bob gaines hadnt at-
tached any menace to himself in the oc-
currence but don kincaid had jacopo
was mentioned by hunchback

  suppose you lay all your cards on
the table mr spinelli don said at
last in a quiet voice i advise perfect
frankness on your part-in this matter
the marchesa said you were to be
trusted

  ah yes beamed the italian his
eyes fixed on the ceiling yes of
course you desire to ask questions

bene i will answer them to any-er-
reasonable extent

  very well said kincaid shortly
just how much are you in the know
about this affair do you savvy the
stendahl helmets contents

  spinelli barely hesitated to a de-
gree he replied cautiously it is my
business to know things mr kincaid
for i am angelo spinelli i have many
eyes and ears-yes sir and to do a
service for the charming lady of ser-
ravalle is quite an honor

  you havent answered my ques-
tion repeated don

  ah yes about the contents of the
helmet said spinelli smiling under-
standingly at the radio it contained
directions purporting to point one to
the location of a valued article i be-
lieve a certain cup or chalice to be
explicit so i was informed
informed by whom demanded
don the marchesa

  these things become known said
spinelli vaguely there has been
much talk mr kincaid-much too
much talk many people know

  who is that damned hunchback who
had me on the carpet last night don
clipped out suddenly the one with
the withered legs and frog eyes
spinelli chuckled again

  a very dangerous person he said
he is called gibboso but his real
name is ungarelli i believe and he
is a ringleader of a very sinister and
most secretly secret society called the
lazzaroni that means lepers you
know-and their wits guns or knives
can be bought or hired for any adventure
or deed just so the pay is sufficient
the organization is very strongly
webbed over all europe and is not to
be sneered at here in america its un-
derground reaches all over the world
they were the men who caused you
trouble last night

  don kincaid was thinking swiftly
and clearly and stephanie graetz
the werewolfs helmet



he avked there was also a mans
name mentioned last night with hers
in the lepers roost-i dont think of it

right now-

  von ermoli nodded spinelli look-
ing carefully at the waste-paper basket
an austrian baron i believe he
and the lady appear to be very intimate
there seems to be little doubt but that
they are behind the lazzaroni in the
matter of the chalice the lepers work
for pay-von ermoli graetz et cie
are paying yes sir

  i see said don slowly but who
are they

  that i cannot answer shrugged
spinelli and i have tried hard to
find out time will bring it to light i
suppose

  then who is the man who styles
himself monsieur duchenin

  spinellis half-closed eyes widened
and for one startled moment he stared
straight at kincaid i know not that
name he said puzzled now per-
haps you can tell me something

  don recounted his meeting with the
bearded stranger and left out nothing
but it was obvious that signor spinelli
knew nothing whatever about duchenin
neither reflected don did the hunch-
back gibboso nor stephanie graetz
the mysterious man of the dining car
was indeed a mystery and the hidden
card in the deck

  i must look into this muttered
signor spinelli yes sir

 one more question said don
who is tramonti

  spinelli started slightly slid another
split-seconds look at don then his
black eyes became opaque and his fat
face blank

  i have heard that name in italy
he said disarmingly but im unac-
quainted with any one who bears it
either personally or by hearsay where
does it come in mr kincaid
possibly not at all don said care-
lessly the girl stephanie graetz

mentioned it somehow i believe i am
merely trying to tie up a lot of loose
ends and thought maybe this one be-
longed

  that spinelli was lying about the
name tramonti he well knew his an-
swer had been evasive and don re-
membered that the hunchback had
thrown the name in his dons face the
previous night coupling it with the
marchesas no matter about that now
-it could keep but he wouldnt for-
get it there was a darky in the wood-
pile there sure as shooting

 i suppose you know remarked
spinelli chuckling anew and changing
the subject that the lazzaroni will put
you on a spot for last nights job mr
kincaid of the three men you shot
two are dead and the other dying you
are to be commended upon your ac-
curacy yes sir it is a pity that you
didrt kill gibboso when you had the
chance

  i had no chance said don his
gunmen kept me busy-that fellow
called chopper and his pal and the
knife-slinging polenta hound

  ziccardini yes purred spinelli a
neapolitan and a bad one he is the
one fatally sho chopper and moro
are dead bumped finish like that
hmmm don scratched his head
is there likely to be trouble with the
police-for me i mean to be ar-
rested now would be damned incon-
venient

  i think not said spinelli to-
morrow at one fifteen noon you sail on
the cesare battisti police will hardly
be brought into this-not after the
timely demise of jacopo last night
that will set the lazzaroni to thinking
it is a matter of twenty-four hours un-
til your steamer sails

signor spinelli smoked a moment in
silence staring at the telephone then
said gently if you still care to sail
what do you mean asked don
sharply


the popular magazine

 this the lady serravalle has
authorized me to take over the delivery
of the-ah-papers if you wish it
said spinelli to assume full re-
sponsibility from new york on she
quite understands the seriousness of her
request to you in the light of recent
events you may cable her for con-
firmation of this should you wish to-
ah-get out from under

  no-thanks said don curtly i
dont use reverse gears ill occupy my
reservations on the battisti as scheduled
-barring accidents this last he said
grimly a crooked smile on his face

  quite so replied the unperturbed
spinelli i did not expect an answer
otherwise now he said more briskly
may i make a suggestion mr kin-
caid

  bene a very trusted man of mine
waits downstairs and outside is a com-
fortable car with an excellent chauffeur
i understand that you must see to the
visa of your passports getting luggage
to the pier et cetera new york is go-
ing to be decidedly dangerous for you
the next twenty-four hours my friend
and i want to do my best to see that
no-ah-unseemly accidents occur
my suggestion is this guido males-
pini downstairs is a head lieutenant of
mine one to be thoroughly trusted and
can keep always in touch with me it
will be far better if you use the car
and driver i mentioned and take guido

as a-er-

  bodyguard asked don smiling
thinly

  something like that you do not
know the lazzaroni mr kincaid that
you have drawn first blood and check-
mated them so far must not lessen your
caution regarding them if i am able
to cover you with some measure of
protection i must ask your cooperation
yes sir

  very well said don after a mo-
ments thought and-thanks
niente niente said spinelli wav-

ing his fat hands depreciatingly and
heaving up to his feet you are a
brave man mr kincaid-i wish you
all the success in the world the lady
serravalle is indeed fortunate in hav-
ing such an able and loyal friend give
my very best wishes to her per piacere
yes sir

  thanks again-and i will replied
don carelessly i think you had better
have signor malespini up here before
you leave he added so there will be
no misunderstandings

  i was coming to that said spinelli
may i use your phone

  the maroon-colored limousine purred
southward out of central park and
threaded through the traffic toward
downtown new york its tires singing
on the wet pavement don kincaid
leaning back in a corner of the tonneau
looked with uninterested eyes through
the veil of tobacco smoke clouding his
face out at the rows of houses and
apartment hotels flashing past he
glanced at his wrist watch the hands
read twelve minutes past four after-
noon

  signor spinellis men had been all he
professed the driver of the maroon
car was a slim alert italian who han-
dled the bus dexterously and easily
guido malespini was a dapper pleas-
ant suave-faced gunman whose smile
displayed much dental gold and smut-
black eyes seemed to look everywhere at
once he occupied the rear seat with
kincaid bob gaines hands in his over-
coat pockets sat beside the driver a
bit ahead of the limousine a sedan
bowled along carrying three men fifty
yards behind a second car slid down
the street carrying four men spinelli
didnt believe in doing things by halves

  don kincaid smiled slightly as he
thought of this the day had been un-
eventful directly after lunch he had
gone with guido and his wary gorillas
to the steamship offices the italian con-
the werewolfs helmet



sulate to a store or two his reserva-
tions were in his pocket the passports
visaed steamer trunks at the pier
everything was in readiness for him to
go aboard at noon to-morrow

  and he reflected grimly he had been
able to tie up several loose ends of the
barbarossa puzzle the whole affair was
beginning to take some semblance of
form under his cold arrangement of
facts gina strozzi tramonti and co
apparently working hand and glove with
the italian fascisti were after red-
beards chalice

  stephanie graetz von ermoli et cie
including that sinister and far-flung se-
cret organization called the lepers
was the second cog in the machination
and the mysterious duchenin was the
third all opposing each other and at
leat two of them direly dangerous

  the marchesas crowd were some-
thing of a dark horse don was no
fool despite some rather peculiar ac-
tions of his gina strozzi had taken
it for granted that don would deliver
the helmet or what it contained to her
intact or-had she might not even
now she be taking precautions to see
that the secret of the chalice was de-
livered to her

  certainly she wodldnt expect don
to travel half across the world to bring
her the tin hat sight-unseen with kin-
caid in possession of the secret what
was to prevent him from securing the
chalice in person  the helmet had been
given to him by karl stendahl loup-
garou how did the lady serravalle
know that he don wouldnt keep the
chalice or return it to the house of
furstenberg its rightful owners

  he chuckled to himself no gina
strozzi wasnt such a trusting fool as
that perhaps she believed that don
didnt know the value of the chalice or
might possibly believe that he would
deliver it blindly to her on account of
old associations yet she would watch
and take precautions

  and once in italy don would be
powerless to do otherwise than accede
to her demands for her family and in-
fluence was powerful in the land of the
boot that would be her line of
thought

  and he donald fitzalan kincaid
held the golden key to the secret the
high ace in the hole of the whole
fantastic affair strozzi expected him
to give her the key without question
stephanie graetz and monsieur du-
chenin apparently believed likewise so
did spinelli don laughed shortly
flipped away his cigarette stretched his
legs

  a green taxicab turning against the
light at madison avenue ran full tilt
and broadside into the maroon limou-
sine skewering it over against the curb
hurling him to the floor in a shower of
broken glass for ten seconds don
kincaid huddled perfectly still a bit
dazed and shaken by the unexpected
suddenness of the deliberately timed
collision

  klaxons rasped and horns roared
voices were raised angrily a crowd
quickly gathered don pulled himself
upright and climbed out of the half-
overturned car into the crowd his green
eyes stabbing at one and another of the
group around him guido malespini
a bloody handkerchief held to his face
was talking tersely to a policeman

  the chauffeur and bob gaines both
apparently unhurt stood near by their
gaze fixed upon the two occupants of
the green cab who were expostulating
loudly and railing at its driver a hard-
faced broken-nosed mug who acted half
drunk or dazed and the trio stood
covered and knew it by spinellis guns
the trailing car behind the limousine
had come up and quickly disgorged its
occupants

  the taxi driver claimed it was an ac
cident his presumable fares berated
him for careless driving and drunken-
ness  guido and don kincaid held their


the popular magazine

tongues the two men in the cab
blustery customers both tried to cover
their uneasiness by loud talk one
wore horn-rimmed glasses and a soft
hat pulled low over his face the other
was soft and portly and looked like a
soap salesman there was no doubt
but that the collision had been arranged
and for some purpose that had missed
fire but guido malespini and his
fascists settled their difficulties outside
of a police station

  a few routine questions by a police-
man then don entered the tailing se-
dan and was rapidly driven to his hotel
guido accompanied him as far as the
curb entrance stating grimly that the
boys would take care of those guns
the presence of that covering car had
probably saved both their lives as well
as bob gaines and the drivers

  the lepers were not asleep don
thought dryly-not by a damned sight

  accompanied by bob don went up to
his suite stopping at the desk long
enough to get his wallet and a letter
that had been left for him he unlocked
the door walked in and switched on the
lights for the afternoon was dark un-
der a sky the color of raw oysters

  relocking the corridor door he
glanced around keenly then with the
indian-negro began a careful search
of the suite they had been absent al-
most four hours

  drawing-room bedroom corridor
and valets room drew blanks the win-
dows were apparently untampered with
nothing seemed to have been disturbed
don switched on the radio tuned in a
local station went to his bedroom and
undressed he mixed a drink put on
a bath robe and started to the bath-
room whistling between his teeth

  the door was closed and he shoved
it open carelessly then he stopped so
suddenly jerking taut and erect that
an invisible rope seemed to have lassoed
him in his tracks for as long as one
could count fifteen he stood on the

threshold motionless and staring his
green eyes narrowed slits his mouth a
crooked gash

  oh bob he called grimly front
and center on tke double

  the indian-negro appeared at his
side like a shadow and at dons
gesture peered into the bathroom he
caught his breath sharply

  my gawd he muttered now
who done that

  a man lay on his back in the bath-
tub his head lolling against one end
his feet spraddled out in ihe other a
well-dressed fellow of some twenty-
eight years clad in a gray suit and top-
coat very black of hair and eyes a
gray hat lay on the white stool near by
the face beneath the carefully combed
black hair was hideous-swollen pur-
pie and mottled it was stamped with
such an expression of fear and pain
that both don kincaid and bob gaines
felt their hair rise

  he was quite dead of course and
a deeply bitten circle around his neck
shouted mutely that he had been gar-
roted

the red stiletto

pon leaned forward and examined
the man closely an italian evi-
dently and he had died most painfully
the cord used was not in sight nor
did a later minute search disclose it
don closed the door put bob gaines
on watch outside and systematically
went through the fellows clothes

  a pocketknife two dollars and fifty-
seven cents in loose change a stub of
a pencil a handkerchief and a small
bunch of skeleton keys came to light
not a mark of identification about him
anywhere but from his right sleeve
strapped there in a cleverly concealed
spring came forth a long slim knife
needle-tipped and razor-edged

  and the haft of the stiletto was
painted dark red
the werewolfs helmet



  presently don called bob gaines
they carried the fellow out of the bath-
room and placed him in a bedroom
clothes closet his overcoat buttoned
tightly about his body his hat pulled
over his eyes locking the door don
swallowed another drink lit a fag then
had bob gaines swab out the bathtub

  while the indian-negro was doing
this don stood at the window staring
out and down at the panorama of
gotham fast darkening in the mists of
late evening once he raised the win-
dow and leaned out a moment sharply
scanning the pavements beneath

  bathed shaved and dressed he sat
at the table and drew out the wallet
from his pocket in doing so the letter
that had been left at the desk downstairs
came with it and don looked at it curi-
ously it had been forgotten in the
business upstairs the handwriting on
the envelope addressed to him in an
unfamiliar scrawl was without a clew
save that it bore hotel insignia and he
ripped open the jacket a single sheet
of stationery was within and upon it
the dashed-off words

  will you accept -american dol-
lars-for the emperors flagon no attend
you m kincaid can one make a kettle
drum from the skin of a little little mouse
can even a foolhardy yanqui achieve the im-
possible i ask you twenty thousand
pounds may not mean much to you mein
freund-but yet it is better than crape and
silver handles	d

   p s you had a visitor this afternoon while
you were away im rather certain you still
have him-and his red stiletto treat him
considerately

  don kincaid slowly read then re-
read the note m duchenin was in
the way of becoming a jester he thought
dryly ten lines containing an offer
a warning and a grim joke upon death
no doubt duchenin himself or one of
his cohorts had done in the italian with
a thuggees cord while he was prowling
in dons room or else had killed him
elsewhere and brought the body in

  however that was unlikely it was

more to the point that a member of the
lazzaroni as well as agents of m
duchenin could gain access to suite
c at will that wasnt a pleasant
thought not a bit

  the telephone shrilled and he an-
swered it was signor spinelli after
polite queries as to the afternoons acci-
dent at madison avenue spoke matter-
of-factly a hotel room is not the
most exciting in nyork to spend ones
time mr kincaid he said but it is
at least fairly safe i would suggest
most strongly that you and your man
remain indoors to-night

 thanks were any of you boys at
the hotel this afternoon

  yes sir two were downstairs in
the foyer-not above why

  i just wondered said don care-
lessly you think it unsafe to go out 
very repeated spinelli earnestly
the boys-ah-located a tommie gun
in a suitcase in the green cab mr kin-
caid but for a blunder of the driver
in getting too previous a nasty mess
might have happened certain parties
seem to be very anxious that you dont
leave our great city yes sir they do
spinelli chuckled hoarsely then be-
came matter-of-fact take your dinner
and breakfast in your suite call for
waiter  at room service-and
spinelli described the man minutely
hes o k and if you need me any
time during the night-he gave don a
phone number and mr kincaid he
finished seriously keep an eye out for
the wild card in the deck our friend m
duchenin

  you turned up anything on him
don asked quickly

  no said spinelli heavily and i
dont like it gbye

  supper finished don sat in the
drawing room with bob gaines smok-
ing a cigarette thoughtfully the win-
dow shades were drawn the door locked
and a towel draped over the keyhole
the suite was in darkness save the
drawing room and it was but dimly


the popular magazine

lighted the radio speaker jangled
forth a throttled-down musical chain
program the indian-negro was en-
grossed in the days paper and don
kincaid was perusing the registered let-
ter received the afternoon before a
letter whose heading was questions
and answers department american
information bureau washington d
c and it consisted of two closely
typewritten pages of official paper

  don kincaid read it carefully re-
flectively for in it was set out at
length all that the world knew of the
barbarossa chalice

  a precious relic dating from some-
where about  fashioned by lango-
bardi artisans from virgin gold deli-
cately carved and thickly ornamented
with many precious stones exactly
two feet in height and twenty-three
inches in circumference it was its base
the skull of cleph a vicious lombard
king who fell beneath carolingian arms
in the conquest this grisly base had
two famous blood rubies as eyes and
perfect pearls as teeth-the collection
and selection of the latter taking many
years-and the base rested on four
horn feet leafed with gold called grif-
fins claws

  the chalice proper was an astounding
work of art it bore two curved
carved handles a top in the shape of a
wild boars head and on two sides
double eagles in bold relief holding
frederick firsts coat of arms this
coat of arms was a rearing charger
helmeted and caprisoned bearing a
mailed knight with defiant naked sword
in one hand shield in the other both
horses head and knights head were
crowned by flaring eagles and plumed
crests another black adler spread its
wings on the shield still others front
and fore on the chargers armorial trap-
pings

  and the whole including the coats
of arms and double eagles was a per-
fection of delicate carvers art-a be-
wildering succession of engraving

molding minute filigree work gothic
crestings and foliage mingled with
coronals of vine leaves and the whole
was thickly studded with rare precious
stones-diamonds sapphires emeralds
turquoise onyx two black opals liv-
ing flames shot through with greens
and blues and yellows were perhaps the
most valuable stones in the chalice

   its monetary value had been variously
placed at from five hundred thousand
dollars to seven hundred thousand dol-
lars and that apart from the priceless
historical value for it was one of the
very few bona-fide relics from ancient
days and it had come temporarily into
possession of the furstenberg family
tree after barbarossas defeat at leg-
nano then permanently after fred-
ericks death by drowning in cilicia in
 the furstenbergs were close
blood kin of redbeard the eagle of
thuringia

  and the name by which the chalice
was known in museums and among con-
noisseurs was the kaiserbecher some
time in  during the late world
war it had mysteriously disappeared
from its residence at schloss reiffen-
stein in the ortleralpz and no trace
had ever been found of it count
lothar von furstenberg then custodian
of the chalice had died in  after
five years fruitless search

  an inexplicable mystery surrounded
the fatal goblet which mountain legend
and superstition credited with having
evil power its history was one of war
and bloodshed and folk whispered that
its gruesome base was haunted by the
malicious spirit of cleph it would re-
appear so legend ran in that spooky
ruined castle of thuringia when the
redbeard at last broke his chains and
rose up once more to lead gothic arms
in battle

  don kincaid folded the letter put
it in his pocket it would be a hot
joke he though wryly if karl sten-
dahl the laup-garou of europe were
playing a jest upon the world at large
the werewolfs helmet



those papers in the helmet might be
phony the prank of a mad trickster
who had invented the whole tale out
of a haywire imagination still the
kaiserbecher of redbeard was gone
and several people believed the helmets
secret enough to go any lengths to
secure it

   that lad in the closet is not the first
to be killed on account of it he fin-
ished grimly or likely the last

  snapping out of his reflections with
a jerk he looked at his watch twenty
minutes after nine the night went
slow up there in suite c youd
better pipe down and grab some kip
he told bob gaines ill call you at
one thirty and you can have the lob-
ster trick till dawn

  after the indian-negro had gone
don smoked a while in silence his
thoughts shuttling clearly and concisely
he walked to the window let up the
shade and stared down at the blurred
city a half mist half fog lay heavy
over manhattan and a chill wind was
blowing the smudged lights battled
impotently with the murk blinking
bravely and staining the sky a ghostly
yellow their wavering reflections pat-
terning the icy black pavement a fine
night for trickery and treachery and
murder don reflected an ideal night
for lots of things

  the sharp peal of the telephone
whipped him around he pulled down
the window shade switched off the
radio took up the receiver

  hello this is kincaid why good
evening dear enemy its nice to hear
your so-charming voice on the telephone
again-

  the left corner of dons mouth
twitched and his eyes were coldly alert
stephanie graetz was on the wire and
her voice came low husky and hurried
nor did she beat about the bush in com-
ing straight to the point

  listen mr kincaid dont inter-
rupt please if you are a sensible per-
son you will remain at the hotel to-

  night and not go out on the streets or
to a theater understand

  perfectly sister is our mutual
friend gibboso on the prod im
sorry i had to use extreme measures
last night-with him and his gorillas-
but i dont like to be shanghaied and
care less about being knocked off in
some filthy slum to please-er-a lady
and a gent called von ermoli

 he heard her catch her breath
sharply

  that is untrue- she began hotly

then very low you are still deter-
mined in spite of everything to go
ahead with this madness american
quite determined in spite of hell
and high water stephanie but tell me
-why mustnt i roam the streets of
gotham this march eve  are the green
taxis still running contrary to red signal
lights 

  i dont understand-slowly but
please attend to my words it is not
the joke i speak mr kincaid-believe
me it isnt

  i know said don grimly but
if i sit indoors and twiddle my thumbs
wont you talk to me a while  i rather
like you after a fashion stephanie
graetz despite your fondness for
guns and knives and queer people how
about lunching with me to-morrow
good-bye mr kincaid i-i am
sorry

  before he could reply he heard the
sharp click of the prong being depressed
stephanie graetz was gone

don rubbed his lean jaw a moment
thoughtfully then mixed a stiff highball
and drank it smoking a cigarette at the
same time at eleven oclock he switched
off the radio turned out the light in
the drawing room and left the suite
in darkness save for the faint glow of
a bulb in the bathroom until one
thirty he sat quietly in his chair now
and then burning fags his feet on the
table and a revolver at his elbow at
one thirty-one he got up and quietly
roused bob gaines his hitch had been


the popular magazine

dully uneventful and at fifteen min-
utes to two he was asleep

  he awoke instantly every faculty
alert and his eyes wide at a gripping
squeeze on his shoulder bob gaines
bending above him whispered sibilantly
theres somebody at the hall door

  don got up noiselessly stuck his bare
feet in soft slippers picked up the auto-
matic laying on the bed table the
radiolite hands of his watch lacked ex-
actly three minutes of three oclock
stepping silently as shadows he and
the indian-negro slid across the draw-
ing room and took positions on each
side of the corridor door not a whis-
per of sound had marked their arrival
for both knew the location of every bit
of furniture in the room

  dons eyes fixed upon the diamond-
shaped glass knob glowed like a cats in
the dark the knob was turning inch
by inch it twisted backward and for-
ward-there came the almost inaudible
click of a key being tried in the lock
kincaid his eyes close to the hole
waited until the knob came to rest in
its normal position then in one flashing
move twisted it to the right and flung
the door inward

  a man catapulted through headlong
wildly out of balance and don kincaid
jelled him with a single chopping blow
of his clubbed gun

  bob gaines had darted into the cor-
ridor like a glancing snake his pistol
ready but saw only the flashing shadow
of a second man darting around a bend
in the corridor toward the elevators
when he reached the bend there was
no one in sight along the dim-lit stretch
the fellow was likely a lookout and
possibly had a room at the hotel curs-
ing under his breath the indian-negro
went quickly back to c

  don surveyed the groggy blinking
rat who sat on the bedroom floor and
rubbed the back of his neck his ferret-
like face was twisted in a grimace of
pain and his beady eyes slid about the

  room with animal furtiveness hollow-
cheeked sharp-featured gash-lipped he
looked up at don and bob gaines with
a sneering leer in one hand don held
a squat gat with a silencer on its muzzle
and a long-bladed razor-sharp knife he
had taken from the gangster before he
came to and the haft of the knife
was painted red

  whatsa big idea snarled rat-
face rappin me over the neck and
yankin me in here this a stickup

  innocent child murmured don
unpleasantly he tossed gun and blade
on the bed brushed his hands turned
to the glowering gangster with his face
swiftly flint-hard close the door
bob he said shortly

  now you he addressed the rat
who sent you here and his words
dropped out one by one like steel
pellets

  find out spat the gunman with
an oath

  im going to find out said don
sulkily and youll be a little damaged
in the finding whats your name
who sent you here and why

  im tellin you nawthin see
snarled rat-face go chase yer tail

  tiny red lights moved in don kin-
caids eyes his face was flint-hard above
its clean-clipped jaw all right he
said quietly

  ten minutes later a slobbering ter-
ror-stricken gangster had blurted out
everything he knew and some things
he didnt there are tricks learned in
the wilds and along the mexican bor-
der that cypriano the fox sta tailer
and killer for hunchback gibboso
knew not of his mission had been to
kill both don and his servant-a mis-
sion one chee-chee the mysteriously
strangled fellow reposing in the closet
-had failed to do that afternoon and
the lepers were a bit perturbed about
the failure of chee-chee to report
also more perturbed about the fiasco of
the green cab so on and so forth

  don heard him out lit a cigarette
the werewolfs helmet



glanced at his watch then he nodded
to bob gaines turned off the light and
walked to the window the indian-
negro had shoved the limp-kneed rat
into the bathroom bob carried a
heavy blued-steel  in his hand he
carefully closed the door-there came
a dull smack cypriano pitched forward
headlong and sprawled on the floor un-
conscious

  thats that said don kincaid
grimly now well remove the evi-
dence

  they moved the bodies of chee-chee
and the unconscious cypriano out of
the window onto the roof terrace
where they would not be discovered im-
mediately

chapter viii

en route

a light-tan limousine shuttled
swiftly through new yorks late-
morning traffic toward the transatlan-
tica-italianas pier on forty-seventh
street guido malespini and the chauf-
feur sat on the front seat don kincaid
and signor spinelli faced bob gaines
and a third italian in the tonneau as
on the day previous a car crawled
ahead of the limousine and one be-
hind but both kept nearer this morn-
ing and were full of armed men

   kincaid his gray-felt hat pulled low
over his forehead and the collar of his
overcoat turned up about his chin
swept the sidewalks and street corners
with narrowed wary eyes the cowhide
box containing the helmet roped and
locked reposed between his legs and
bob gainess knees touched his now
and thena queer little grin would edge
dons lips only quickly to disappear as
his gaze scanned anew the slaty sky
the clammy fog the indistinct pedes-
trians and flashing traffic things had
come off like the doctor ordered last
night he thought grimly

   spinelli had called in person for don
that morning as per a phone arrange-
ment and several of his guns were in

evidence when don descended to the
lobby settled his account and took the
leather box from the vault the house
detective and two assistants accom-
panied him to the waiting car waved
him a formal farewell and now he
was bowling through devious streets
and by zigzag course en route to the
pier the driver of the tan car was
taking no chances that morning by go-
ing a direct route from the hotel to
forty-seventh street

  it was almost noon and the battisti
sailed at one thirty and if the weather
didnt change for the better it prom-
ised to be rough sailing in more ways
than one don bent to hear better
something spinelli was saying

  plok a tinkle of falling glass a
sharp thuck close to his ear and a sliver
of wood struck his face don ducked
swiftly but not before a zippy whine
hissed above his head and he felt a
queer jerk at his gray hat the second
bullet continuing its course splintered
the dark woodwork of the opposite car
door a gun with a maxim silencer of
course one that made no more noise
than the pop of a champagne cork
there had been absolutely no sounds of
it down in the street

  that happened just after crossing
forty-fifth street rows of business
houses with rooms above the ground
floor lined both sides of the thorough-
fare and malespini crouched low in his
seat pointed a rigid arm to the left
and shouted something to the driver of
the car behind three men leaped from
it and darted toward the- front of a five-
story building the shots had been fired
from the second floor guido gestured
savagely

  the driver sounding his horn stri-
dently put on a burst of speed and the
car leaped ahead the four men on
the back seats raised up again look-
ing grimly at each other don kincaid
picked up his soft hat from the seat
beside him and very speculatively re-
garded a neat round hole through its


the popular magazine

crown he plucked out a tuft of tawny
hair from the inside of the hat looked
at it thoughtfully then ran bronzed
fingers over his scalp a bullet fired
out of some window across the street
from a silenced weapon could never be
traced

  not bad shooting he remarked im-
personally but he forgot to hold low
when shooting from above-luckily
still it was close enough

  closern that mr don said bob
gaines between his teeth yessir
closern that

  the heavy spinelli grunted and then
mopped his fat face with a huge hand-
kerchief  the italian seated opposite
him said nothing his dark features
blank don kincaid leaned across
toward bob gaines and lowered his
voice a trifle

  reckon well never get to catch any
more fish out of wild plum lake he
asked with a hard grin

  i doubt it said bob gaines bleakly
were a long ways from home and
gittin further mister don way yon-
der further

  the tan limousine drew up at the
street entrance of the transatlantica
pier and unloaded all its passengers save
the chauffeur bob gaines kept fast
hold of the cowhide box in his left
hand his right thrust in the side pocket
of his overcoat a bustling dock stew-
ard took charge of suitcases and bags
and vanished into the electric-lit murk
of the great pier shed the italians in
the two other cars at a sign from
malespini melted into the crowd which
resembled a swarming beehive their
dark eyes watchful guido and his
side kick kept close to don kincaid and
spinelli fists in their pockets

  don took a last look around before
joining the stream of people going into
the pier little flurries of snow were
sifting down in the mist which seemed
to be lightening and the wind off north
river was cold his hawk eyes spotted
a number of italian-looking people in

the pier shed-men lounging casually
near stacks of baggage men talking in
little casual groups men strolling
casually by none stared openly at
spinellis party yet don kincaid and
his companions were the focal point of
these united maneuverings that was
patent smiling a little his every sense
on tiptoe he pushed his way to a wicket
and had his reservations checked the
olive-cheeked black-mustached dignitary
in charge nodded smiled suite b b
deck mr kincaid and man new
york to genoa via gibraltar quite
correct bon voyage sir

  don pocketed his papers and pushed
his way through the vortex of humanity
to the other side of the pier where
through a yawning doorway the black
cliff and parallel lines of rivet heads of
the cesare battistis huge hull bulked
he didnt have to bother about his lug-
gage for all of it was labeled wanted
and a room steward had charge he
and bob gaines with signor spinelli
guido malespini and the gunman called
braccio walked toward the gangway
platform the presence of so many
black-shirt guardians seemed to have
discouraged any last-minute attempts of
the lazzaroni upon kincaid for the
gunmen hung around the flanks of the
embarking party like wolves

  don walking just ahead of bob
gaines stepped up the gangway toward
the liners deck a steward with his
reservation slips was in front of him
while a sleek young italian of spinellis
smoking a cigarette leaned idly against
the ships rail don was almost ready
to step aboard when a low cry from
the indian-negro stung him to an
abrupt halt-the next watch tick bob
gaines grabbed his shoulder and liter-
ally hurled him backward into the fat
bulk of signor spinelli

  something flashed downward a few
inches in front of dons nose and
smashed with a loud impact on the gang-
way a score of eyes darted upward
to the decks above-grunts low oaths
the werewolfs helmet



exclamations followed a ships officer
came running

  for a short second don looked at the
thing that had fallen it was a huge
clay flowerpot with some sort of red
plant in its debris that had tumbled
from one of the decks overhead and
one significant thing he noted the
pot contained no earth but had been
packed with sand and gravel thus form-
ing a missile that would have crushed
his head like an eggshell

  thanks bob said don quietly
narrow margin again my respect
for certain persons is hourly increas-
mg

  with a hard smile and a careless
shrug he stepped aboard the big liner
waved away the gesturing officers
questions with a light word and fol-
lowed the steward along two promenades
and stairways to his room the italian
who had lounged by the rail was gone
he observed a muttered c deck
from guido had sent him racing well
whoever had shoved off the pot had
timed his stroke well-but for the alert-
ness of bob gaines he don kincaid
would have been a casualty

  when the steward had gone don
locked the door and shot the brass bolt
he bob gaines and guido malespini
made a fine-tooth-comb inspection of
suite b from its comfortable parlor
to its two bedrooms and bath nothing
out of the ordinary there

  don pulled down the varnished shut-
ters over the portholes stowed his lug-
gage out of the way until it could be
unpacked snugged the flat automatic
scabbarded against his midriff into posi-
tion and took the  gat from his coat
pocket

  well sir here you are aboard said
spinelli with a wheezy chuckle its
been sort of a narrow squeak a time
or so but we made it i hope you have
as good luck on the voyage

  ill be watching said don levelly
and thanks-for everything

   dont mention it said spinelli

lighting a black cigar it has been a
pleasure to meet and serve you mr
kincaid i trust youll remember me
well to her excellenza the marchesa 
right nodded don youre going
ashore now

  yes sir and if youre ever in
new york look me up good-by
so long spinelli give my regards
to gibboso  co

  they shook hands don eying the
fat italian spinelli saw a tinge of
regret almost sorrow creep into his
black expressionless eyes a momen-
tary expression of pity and sympathy
for the american strangely the next
instant it was gone and with it signor
spinelli guido a minute later
knocked on the door and reappeared

   braccio and civettini are unable to
find the man who threw the pot he
said rapidly but he was on c deck
and people say he was dark-faced wore
a cap and had a big scar on his chin
watch for that fellow signor
thanks grinned don my friend
baroffio the knife he said to bob
gaines when guido had gone were
to have a pleasant traveling companion
it seems this voyage promises to be
interesting yes sir

   carrying the cowhide box don made
his way to the pursers office the indian-
negro at his heels he saw from the
tail of his eye the italian civettini the
youth who had stood at the rail when
he went up the gangway leave his van-
tage point on the promenade deck toss
away his cigarette and casually saunter
behind them don smiled thinly spi-
nelli might have gone ashore but all of
his henchmen hadnt which might
mean most anything

   don entered the pursers office a
scene of busy activity the force was
juggling passenger lists and account
books calling numbers and names back
and forth the purser himself a sal-
low dark man with a thin face and
eyes like an oyster glanced at don
irritably then curiously as he tendered


the popular magazine

the hide box locked and bound to be
placed in the ships strong box a steel
vault under the office

  what is in this signor he asked
sharply

  a vase replied don shortly and
a valuable one i might add that several
attempts have been made to steal it the
past week also my friend i might
add that it is destined for the marchesa
della serravalle

  the pursers sallow face softened in-
gratiatingly he took the box rever-
ently and carefully wrote out a receipt
certainly sir he said graciously it
will be safe here quite safe he finished
pompously there will be no theft of
it perpetrated aboard the cesare battisti
-rest assured of that

  if it is stolen from the strong
box said don meaningly somebodys
neck will tumble the lady serravalle
will-

  i know signor nodded the purser
have no qualms as to its safety the
grail itself would not be guarded more
closely

  don left the office smiling to him-
self at the potency of gina strozzis
name walked back to b decks rail and
looked down upon the pier sheds the
gangways up which people were com-
ing and down which other streams were
going men and women were laughing
talking milling about several italians
still stood casually among the crowd on
the wharf one by the guard rail
looked up at him caught his eye shook
hands with himself with a grin don
nodded

  soon he would leave all this behind-
new york spinelli gibbosos lepers
but he wouldnt leave all of them for
baroffio was apparently aboard and
had proved himself no mean opponent
curiously don wondered about steph-
anie graetz just why had she called
him on the phone last night with her
warning  what were her relations
with von ermoli that man with the
cold hawklike aristocratic face was

he her fiance or friend and what
were their relations with the hunchback
and his ruffians employer and em-
ployee or else-

  a corner of dons mouth twitched
gibbosos sinister picture was clean cut
in his mind that morning-that de-
formed dwarfish fellow with the wea-
zened deathmask face and hooked nose
whose sunken eyes looked like a toads
set in a skull that hypnotic hunch-
back who dragged his withered legs at
a surprising speed and ease  with
crutches who was as cold-blooded as
a shark it seemed to don that mo-
ment as if those basilisk eyes were
boring into his back so much so that
he turned and scanned the white cabin
fronts the length of promenade deck
sharply but the leper was not in
sight of course don decided he was
a bit jumpy

  two narrow shaves inside a half
hour are giving me nerves he grinned
to himself guess i need a damned
stiff drink

  but before he could put this motion
into effect a face coming up the gang-
plank held his gaze frozen a face
whose lines all seemed to blend in the
v-motif of a satan ornamented by a
carefully trimmed vandyke beard and
housing deep-set black eyes beneath
shaggy brows a monocle gleamed in
one and a brown fedora hat brim was
pulled low over a high forehead

  m duchenin knifelike tallish and
with a noticeable hunch in his left
shoulder also was voyaging aboard the
battisti that murky march morning
and behind him carrying two bags
came a pygmyish fellow who moved
with the gliding steely ease of a stalk-
ing snake and had east india written
all over his swart vicious face don
decided that m duchenins valet was
not exactly prepossessing-he looked
like a renegade afghan hillman or a
pathan jackal

  don watched them until they disap-
peared beneath the side of the deck

pop-b
the werewolfs helmet



below this journey he reflected
dryly was certainly not labeled to be a
dull one not for him from all indi-
cations with baroffio and m du-
chenin aboard-all the plot lacked now
was graetz but she likely was re-
maining in new york with her friend
herr von ermoli

  don kincaid swore under his breath
he felt suddenly and unaccountably
out of humor and he knew not what
about

  from somewhere sounded the faint
note of a bugle then a stewards voice
at a distance requesting all visitors to
go ashore a tug tooted raucously an-
other answered the huge bulk of the
battisti throbbed to the deep stertorous
bellow of her whistle people began
running excitedly about on the pier
lines were being slacked off and steve-
dores a swarm of busy ants were tug-
ging at the gangway platforms

  don stood at the rail before his cabin
which was outside and well aft on the
port side of b deck he had donned a
plaid cap in place of his bullet-scarred
hat and a khaki trench coat in lieu of
his overcoat the deck was alive with
passengers and their friends shaking
hands embracing crying in a last hur-
ried departure several worried people
were chasing about after baggage and
anxious stewards were on the lookout
for unintentional stowaways the last
gangway disappeared and the italian
civettini stepping from it stopped on
the pier edge looked up at don sa-
luted carelessly then thumped away his
fag and disappeared in the shed

  five minutes passed six

  the battistis whistle roared again
and don felt the vague tremor of the
engines beneath the pier sheds the
concrete landing the waving shouting
people were slowly moving backward
and a ribbon of gray oily water ap-
peared below the port rails some-
where an orchestra was playing old
man river

  well bob said don kincaid
  pop-b

were off if you want to swim back
youd better start now old son

   spect maybe ill wish i had before
i see gawds solid ground again
grinned the indian-negro its a long
way cross this ocean

  you said a mouthful agreed don
im going to have a squint at our fel-
low travelers see you directly

  don slowly traversed the promenade
deck circling to starboard then de-
scended to the deck below nothing
there he went up to c deck walked
briskly around it fore and aft port and
starboard without better luck there
was no sign of baroffio or monsieur
duchenin anywhere he squinted in
smoking rooms and sun parlor then
walked to the pursers office and asked to
see the passenger list

  carefully he scanned the large-lined
sheets of heavy ledger paper but there
was no name like baroffio or stephanie
graetz or von ermoli listed perhaps
the knife had gone ashore after all-
maybe his tilting the heavy pot onto the
gangway had been a last desperate ges-
ture don shook his head slightly
smiled no-that was not baroffios
style to quit a chase that had led him
half across america

  don handed back the passenger list
with a nod of thanks and left mon-
sieur duchenin and valet were regis-
tered as occupying outside b deck cabins
no - starboard fore monsieur
adalbert duchenin of london

  kincaid slowly ambled back toward
his cabin keenly scrutinizing faces en
route the cesare balisti was gliding
down the bay and the tugs had tooted
their last salutes and cast off the tip
of manhattan island with its skyscrap-
ers the statue of liberty fell astern
smudged and vague in the misty fog
hoarse whistles crept over the water
deep bells and sirens sounded inces-
santly from quarantine and the lower
bay clouds were rolling up low on the
water dusk would come early that
march night


the popular magazine

  smoking reflectively hands deep in
his coat pockets don looked out across
the bleak windy vista with narrowed
eyes that he was being followed and
his every move watched he was certain
trouble might be expected to break
from any quarter at any time but his
spirits were at the top of the ther-
mometer nevertheless the end of this
voyage promised to be the solution of
the karl stendahl mystery and don
felt as confident of the helmets safety-
in the ships strong-box-as he did of
the bank of england the next eight
days promised to be plenty interesting
it was a long way to genoa

  this will make a rare tale to tell
the strozzi he grinned flicking his
cigarette over the rail wonder what
shes doing right now

  perhaps it was as well he did not
know

   don returned to his stateroom pick-
ing up bob gaines en route to help him
unpack on the floor of the drawing-
room just inside the door his eyes fell
upon a blank white envelope don
picked it up the envelope was sealed
and he ripped it open extracting a sheet
of white note paper folded once

  without comment he read the two
written lines in the middle of the page

   you can leave this ship in the pilots boat
take friendly advice and do so

  there was no signature the writ-
ing in blue ink was of a vigorous dis-
tinctive feminine hand there was no
need of signature for don kincaid to
know who penned the missive but had
she thrust it there in person or had a
messenger aboard to deliver it for her

  a rather fascinating enigma was
stephanie graetz he reflected a beau-
tiful provocative young woman an in-
triguing factor in a ruthless scheme
which stopped at nothing once she
had warned him in harristown texas
again by phone in new york and now
by note aboard the battisti

  but why twice certainly she had

attempted to kill him or at least been
a party to the attempt and it didnt
stand to reason that she was ignorant
of the attentions of gibbosos lepers
and the italian called baroffio

  don pocketed the note which smelled
faintly of some strange perfume and 
rang for his room steward the man
a blond italian whose face was scarred
with pox pits and whose hair and mus-
tache looked oilily bleached appeared
at once he spoke understandable if
broken english and was servilely ob-
sequious

  whats your name steward don
asked pleasantly

  giuseppe sir giuseppe pagliuola
never mind the last jawbreaker
now listen carefully giuseppe if any
one aboard attempts to bribe you in
any shape or fashion to spy upon me
or try any monkey business come to me
and ill outbid em that a bargain
yes sir nodded giuseppe shame-
lessly

  all right and from now on your
name to me is joe savvy

  yes sir the steward grinned
but remember said don his voiee
suddenly chill any slipping up or
double crossing on your part is going
to be damned unfortunate friend joe
just that-for you i have reason to
suspect certain persons will try to cross
your palm with lire if they do re-
port it to me and keep your eyes open
you wont lose by it

  yes sir nodded giuseppe sol-
emnly he slid a glance from don to
bob gaines licked his lips let his fea-
tures become wooden anything else
sir

  yes said don bring me a bot-
tle of martel five-star cognac and a
siphon of seltzer water i know we
havent shoved outside the twelve-mile
limit but-can do

  yes sir replied joe imperturb-
ably right away sir

  don grinned at bob gaines after the
door closed upon the steward and the
the werewolfs helmet



two began unpacking the short after-
noon wore away and the dim shore line
of new jersey disappeared in the swift
striding darkness off in the middle
distance ambrose light sent a golden
finger of radiance stabbing over the
black gray-shrouded water the bat-
tisti dropped her pilot off the hook and
the small boat with a hunting cabin for-
ward slid away from the ocean grey-
hounds black hull nothing but blue
water extended from there to gibraltar
and the cesare battisti thrust her nose
dead east into it moving with cautious
rolls and swells

  dinner that night was uneventful for
don he was assigned a table by the
dining-saloon steward and ate well
from aperitif to demi-tasse afterward
he took a turn around the deck despite
the rising wind and thickening mist and
noted with a faint smile that the win-
dows of starboard cabins nos -
were smudged with light but curtained
closed and shuttered

  not once in dining saloon smoking
room or on deck had he caught sight
of monsieur duchenin or baroffio the
knife nor of stephanie graetz

  he returned to his suite and for
ten minutes was busy three hours
later he opened the deck door walked
to the rail and leaned against a stan-
chion apparently absorbed in the dull
reflections of lighted ports on a sea
black as onyx far beneath him amer-
ica was hull-down long since and the
salt night wind blew whippingly

chapter ix

an armed truce

the statue of liberty was three days
behind and the cesare battiste had
settled down after a fashion into the
routine of her eastbound trip so far
it hadnt been an ideal voyage not by a
long shot for the weather was cold and
rainy the sea rough the clouds slaty
and lowering it wasnt overbad for
march

  but on the fourth morning it did get
so dawn brought a full atlantic gale
down from its maw that seriously trou-
bled even the hardiest and most ex-
perienced sea legs and drove the ma-
jority of passengers to their berths
blanched of face blurry of eye and
greenish-blue of lip

  don kincaid finishing his breakfast
in an almost deserted dining room took
his trench coat from a hook in the hall
outside the saloon turned its collar up
to his ears pulled his cap down to his
eyes and went on deck a seasoned
traveler he was not troubled with
nausea the gale meant nothing to him
one way or another

  the same could not be said of bob
gaines the indian-negro had gone
down for the count when the battisti
began to pitch and nose-dive and twist
and was curled up like a dying animal
in his berth his coppery face the color
of lead don grinned at the recollection
as he shoved along the promenade deck
fists in his coat pockets and head low-
ered to the blast of wind and whipping
spray the room steward was looking
after bob

  it was queer don cogitated that his
enemies aboard hadnt made their pres-
ence known by unpleasant attentions
to the moment he had not been mo-
lested in the slightest he had taken
his place in the life aboard that luxu-
rious floating hotel filled with people of
assorted nationalities and was a famil-
iar figure in the saloons recreation hall
and smoking room on deck and in the
music room

  in his lean hard-bitten fashion he was
immensely attractive to most of the
feminine contingent to them he was
more romantic and intriguing than if
hed been finely bred and he looked
capable of doing anything he might
want to do those aboard the battisti
didnt miss that certain something
about him-that hint of capability in
any emergency that hint of thorough
readiness to cope with anything at any

time he patently owned a tough stom-
ach and possessed a thick wallet wore
no rings on his fingers or under his
eyes and was certainly vastly interest-
ing

  and being a mans man the male
population of the smoking room took
up with him immediately

  on the first morning out of new
york he had run across monsieur du-
chenin don had just left the wireless
office on the boat deck after filing a
marconigram to gina strozzi when he
met the vandyked monocled gentleman
ascending the steps apparently bent
upon a similar mission to sparks
both had smiled simultaneously

  good morning don said mali-
ciously not waiting to present me
with a silk-cord necktie i hope

  no replied monsieur duchenin
coolly you are far too interesting as
an opponent my dear young friend
may i congratulate such unique clever-
ness 

  thanks don nodded a bit soberly
and mine to you by the way

  dont mention it said monsieur
duchenin some time perhaps mr
kincaid it would be well if you and
i had a talk no hurry my stateroom
is -b

  i know grinned don just as
you know mine is suite b-b

  so then bowed monsieur du-
chenin raising his hat until later
monsieur good day

  kincaid grinned can one make a
drum from the skin of a field mouse
he called over his shoulder

  no more than one will live out his
allotted span if he attempts to ride
tigers retorted monsieur duchenin
with an inscrutable glance at the amer-
ican he disappeared toward the radio
cabin

  don was thinking of that as he stared
over the steep slopes of angry gray wa-
ter their crests white-fanged balanc-
ing himself to the pitch and roll of the
boat and pondering upon that encoun-

ter and the subsequent conversation
with vandyke the second day aboard

  they had met quite casually in the
smoking room that afternoon and the
place happened to be deserted save for
the bar steward

  mr kincaid said duchenin with-
out preliminary if you were a sensible
young man you and i could do busi-
ness and quickly i shall speak frankly
mein freund are you willing to lay
a few cards on the table or not

  don kincaid studied the hawkish
monocled face a long moment through
a fog of tobacco smoke then nodded
shortly all right ill gamble a lit-
tle

 very well monsieur duchenin
took a swallow from his glass of rossi
first just what is your pound of flesh
in this affair mr kincaid is it per-
centage a split or cold monetary trans-
action 

  you mean what do i expect to get
out of the marchesa for delivering karl
stendahls helmet to her

  exactly i do not quite figure you
as a romantic philanthropic fool herr
kincaid

  anger rose in dons eyes and he
said coldly you as well as the rest
seem to ignore the fact that stendahl
gave me the helmet if all this tosh
about the barbarossa chalice were true
and didnt turn out to be pure moon-
shine the fact still remains that the
flagon was stolen by a notorious crook
what makes you suppose that if i knew
its hiding place i wouldnt turn it over
to its rightful owners

  several things replied monsieur
duchenin slowly one is that count
lothar von furstenberg the rightful
owner is dead his son was killed in
galicia during the war so far as i
know there is no direct furstenberg to
turn the chalice over to and another
reason he said more slowly is mr
kincaid even if it were possible you
would never be allowed to do such a
quixotic thing
the werewolfs helmet



  the hell i wouldnt said don
calmly and whod prevent me
again several things this leprous
secret society called the lazzaroni-
mademoiselle graetz et cie-par ex-

lengths they will go to prevent your de-
livering the information to lady serra-

kincaid is a second reason you would
not be allowed to make any rightful res-
titution of the cup-especially not north
of the brenner

  no why north of the brenner
especially

  because there lies what is left of
austrian tyrol after the jackals in
paris finished with her carcass said
monsieur duchenin milady serra-
valle stands hand in glove with a man
in chigi palace rome and has power
behind her she would doubtless turn
the chalice over to the italian govern-
ment-for an enormous price-in re-
turn for aid given her in obtaining it
she and her friend the count arnulfo
tramonti stand to make a great many
lire if they succeed

  who asked don is tramonti
one of the cleverest and most un-
scrupulous scoundrels in europe your
present employer mr kincaid presum-
ing that you intend delivering the hel-
mets secret to the lady the lazzaroni
et al are opposing you also-van-
dyke bowed and drained his glass-
also myself mein freund

  then you are a leper don asked
quietly

  hardly and monsieur duchenin
laughed unpleasantly i am the third
angle in the problem except to you
the unknown quantity and i desire
very much indeed that golden jeweled
cup ja wohl yes attend mein hen
and let me paint a picture

  monsieur duchenin leaned forward
his inky eyes burning

  picture gems under a golden boars
head lid that would stir the pulses of
an indian rajah emeralds of apple

green sapphires as blue as the gulf of
sorrento beneath a summer sun dia-
monds as coldly flashing as glacial ice
rubies red as pigeon blood opals black
as neros eyes priceless jewels a solid
coruscating mass of them all against the
soft glowing background of yellow
gold dont you see it

  monsieur duchenins voice had grown
hoarse his hands were clenched and
his eyes blazed like twin volcanoes
mr kincaid he said low-voiced
have you any idea of how much money
that chalice is worth

  don smiled thinly at the ash tipped
end of his cigarette and replied deliber-
ately yes half a million dollars-
probably a bit more

  ah breathed monsieur duchenin
he shut his eyes suddenly opened them
wide and you you alone american
know its hiding place yes

  don smiled tantalizingly your
one-hundred-thousand-dollar offer fell a
bit short of the target didnt it he
said pleasantly changing the subject
slightly would you mind telling me why
you garroted that thug in my hotel
room 

  eh said monsieur duchenin ab-
sently then oh yes you speak of
the leper you discovered in the bath-
tub he was in danger of interfering
with my plans by unwise meddling so
he was removed

  just like that eh said don
know what he was doing in my
room 

  of course-a bit impatiently so
mr kincaid you wont do business over
the counter with me eh well im
sorry

  wheres stephanie graetz asked
don suddenly

  monsieur duchenin smiled frostily
cooking up trouble for you likely a
clever woman she im one of the few
people who know just how clever she
is he pushed back his chair lit a
long pale-green cigar

  youre quite determined to carry on


the popular magazine

and deliver the message of the loup-
garou to her excellency the mar-
chesa he demanded

   thatll be for you to discover mon-
sieur x the unknown said don

  as you wish truly it is said that
allah darkens the eyes of men who
are destined to destruction he quoted
impersonally again i state that i
am sorry

  thanks don grinned insolently
yet nothing ever beat a try but a
flop

  he got up looked monsieur du-
chenin straight in the eye and said
evenly id like to know if youve any
designs upon me with your silk rope
just in case you understand for
frankly i rather enjoy your entertain-
ing company

  the vandyked man laughed shortly
as you say he replied meaningly
that will be for you to find out mon-
sieur kincaid i also find your com-
panionship quite interesting we need
not be unfriendly

  he bowed politely glanced sidewise
at don and left the smoking room

  and now on the fourth morning
donald kincaid walked the gale-swept
decks of the battisti eyes blinking from
the lash of spume lazily alert despite
the quietness of the voyage so far he
did not discount duchenin lightly for
he knew that the monsieur x in the
game was an opponent to be warily re-
spected don had seen him several
times since on deck in dining and
smoking rooms they had exchanged
conversation without mentioning the
chalice

  but what of stufa baroffio if the
leper was aboard he had certainly kept
well concealed yet coldly thinking of
what import would it be for any one
to attack him don in midocean

   the helmet was in the pursers care
and don had given instructions that it
be delivered to gina strozzi in case any-
thing happened to him still it was no
use in relaxing his vigilance or lowering

his guard perhaps that was just what
they expected him to do

  he made his way to c deck and be-
gan a slow tour of it stopping now
and then at the rail to squint out across
the wild and gloomy atlantic it was
a menacing picture with the huge
marching walls of gray water bearded
with white and twenty feet from trough
to crest sweeping down upon the liner
with battering smashing fury

  the sky was dark and bleak with
sable clouds themselves tattered and
torn by the gale that swept them along
and stinging squalls of rain whipped
the decks driven by a steadily rising
wind spray and spindrift dashed along
the promenades and against the cabins
like white steam salty and ruinous to
clothing but don kincaid didnt seem
to care

  he made his way on toward the bows
which now reared until they seemed to
scrape the scudding clouds then plunged
to bury themselves deep in a gray-green
valley the slippery wet deck slanted
first this way then that against the saw-
toothed horizon expert sea legs were
necessary to navigate at all and don
chuckled as twice he was unbalanced
and thrown off his feet as he was
picking himself up the second time an-
other figure appeared at the forward
turn of the promenade deck the slender
figure of a girl in a dark-blue raincoat
and a snug-fitting helmet and she
clung to the rail with one hand to her
hat with the other spindrift whipped
about her in feathery tendrils

  well muttered don kincaid and
his heart picked up a little voltage so
my dear enemy is aboard after all i
must pay my respects

  stephanie graetz started down the
deck not yet seeing him and the deck
began to rise with the wind behind
her she advanced like she was climbing
a mountain then the angle of the deck
was suddenly reversed the bows went
up and the stern went down

   don clinging to the long white wall
the werewolfs helmet



of a cabin saw her start toward him
at a run down the glistening hill of the
deck-in a second she was running un-
controllably the wind pushing her sav-
agely she was trying to reach the
rail but the deck was tilted so that she
barged along the cabin walls clutching
frantically at any purchase her face
flushed eyes bright red mouth curved
in a laugh

  don his back braced against the cor-
ridor wall opened his arms to catch
her and cushion the shock of her inter-
rupted runaway but when she was
almost in reach the deck tilted the other
direction and she lurched to the left
and away from him toward the rail

  she struck her shoulder against a
stanchion caromed off spun about twice
in a swirl of blue raincoat cloche hat
and slim legs and would have fallen
heavily if don had not caught her by
the left hand and spun her in the reverse
direction then caught her about the
waist with his right arm so that her
back was against his chest and the back
of her head just under his chin for a
moment she remained so in that smother
of wind and spray laughing and breath-
ing heavily then with a lithe twist freed
herself and looked at her rescuer

  you she exclaimed with widened
violet eyes then crinkled her nose and
laughed lightly lieber gott but this
is dr ole how we meet again signor
it has its compensations this storm
grinned don

  yes and why

  because everybodys holed up in
their berths and this promised to be a
draggy day you and i can have the
ship to ourselves fine

  so she looked at him quizzically
do you forget that we are enemies
msieu le americain

  there are such things as armistices
arent there suppose we declare one
to-day lady dick turpin and seal the
compact with a-er-something hot to
drink below youre wet as a well-
digger and som i

  for a moment she regarded him stead-
ily her violet eyes unfathomable under
their silky black lashes don returned
her gaze unblinkingly his own eyes
dwelling shamelessly upon the wisps of
red-gold hair the piquant oval beauty of
her wind-whipped face the flawless
curve of neck and chin the girl flushed
a little bit her lower lip with small
white teeth smiled uncertainly

  you are a barbarian a sauvage
she exclaimed i am sure i should not
do as you say but-yes-im going to
don grinned at the malice in her eyes
im sure i shouldnt do it either he
said with mock concern for youre
devilishly beautiful and just about as
dangerous as a purring leopardess but
nimrods my middle name

  his grin became wicked as he touched
her arm speaking of names he
added what is yours aboard the lug-
ger  i dont want to embarrass you by
making mistakes out of school milady
she laughed frankly

  perhaps i should let you find out
yet-you so gallantly saved me from a
bad fall and ill tell you i am made-
moiselle sophie haller of roodt lux-
emburg-on the pursers book
thanks said don i feared i had
left you in new york you-and the
honorable von ermoli-along with gib-
boso  co

  please she said quickly her face
sobering instantly let us not speak
of these things this day monsieur it
is unwise as well as unsafe

  just one thing cut in don hur-
riedly is my friend baroffo aboard
he almost crowned me with a flower
pot you know

  the girl laughed shortly a bitter
mirthless sound i tried my best to
warn you mr kincaid she said coolly
both by telephone and letter and
please believe that my efforts were not
without risk to myself i can say noth-
ing further to your questions

  you wont tell me who ermoli is
or what he is to you 


the popular magazine

  no she retorted flushing that
is none of your affair

  oh all right he said cheerfully
ill watch and find out

  so she studied him gravely a
short moment i wonder if you sus-
pect how minutely you have been
watched kincaid or are now

  i have an idea replied don dryly
do you know where the helmet is
of course just as i know what you
ate for dinner last evening

  the hell- don looked blankly

at her a minute dont try to spoof
me sister thats slapping it on a bit
thick you know

  indeed shall i tell you what you
ate at the pursers table where your
chair is

  mockingly she did so and correctly
from soup to dejfti-tasse don stared
at her narrowly hands deep in his coat
pockets but you were not there  he
objected you have kept out of sight
up until now

  that is true-serenely but i
shall do so no longer let us speak of
other things msieu kincaid of texas
they had traversed the weather side
of the boat while talking gone up a
companionway and entered the aft
lounge a steward brought them two
steaming rhum chauds over which they
conversed as gayly and inconsequently
as any ordinary carefree voyagers
aboard the battisti but the girl would
not give don the slightest inkling about
herself and adroitly parried every
tricky question he asked and she in
turn cannily sought for openings in his
cautious armor of reticence about his
mission

  tell me she asked at last with a
mocking quirk of her mouth-tell me
are you really going to deliver the hel-
met to serravalle

yes said don promptly bar-
ring-er-accidents i certainly am
she shook her head in mock sadness
and watched a curling smoke ring from
her cigarette shred and break your

faith in that lady she said with a tan-
talizing smile is touching

  don grinned amiably across at her
can you better her offer he
shrugged

  for a long minute they looked at each
other in silence their faces suddenly
serious a deeper wash of color stained
sophie hallers face as she crushed out
the ash of her cigarette in a tray filled
with the remains of many other ciga-
rettes

  im afraid not msieu she replied
coldly

  don took a box of vestas-matches
made of wax-from his pocket and
carefully placed three to one side of the
table

  those milady he said imperson-
ally represent you and von ermoli
and the lazzaroni and these three-
serravalle tramonti et cie and this
one match-monsieur x a lone wolf
and this one match-yours truly-in
the center fate is dealing the cards
in this foursome and i hold the high
trump so far when all the cards are
dealt and the show-down comes
stephanie graetz or sophie haller or
whatever your name isnt somebodys
going to be left holding a busted flush

  the girl leaned forward her breath
coming a bit fast her eyes stabbing into
dons like leaping rapiers

  why have you not placed your vesta
beside the marchesas she asked a lit-
tle breathlessly

  im not showing my cards said
don giving her a hard grin not any
more than you are showing yours but
you gina strozzi and monsieur x of
london all know that i hold the ace of
trumps

  monsieur x repeated the girl
quickly and he is mr kincaid-

 don laughed speaking of the
devil- he said half to himself al-
low me to present the gentleman in per-
son this is good

  he turned in his seat and hailed mon-
sieur duchenin who had just entered
the werewolfs helmet

s

the lounge and was staring about ab-
sently and polishing his monocle the
vandyked man caught dons eye
nodded briskly shot a keen glance at his
companion then walked over to the wall
table showing his teeth in a swordfish
smile

  join us wont you monsieur in-
vited kincaid mademoiselle haller
of luxemburg allow me monsieur
duchenin of london smiling wick-
edly he sat back down motioning to an
empty chair duchenin bowed mur-
mured a polite acknowledgment and
took the seat quite urbane and unper-
turbed

  thank you no he said in reply to
dons invitation to drink i do not use
alcohol this early in the day he
glanced at his watch but i will be
glad to join you for morning broth it
is time for it i notice

  don frankly studied the faces of his
table companions a mocking light in his
level eyes monsieur duchenin con-
versed easily and lightly his mien a pic-
ture of old world courtesy stephanie
graetzs face was impassive her eyes a
wary study but beneath her outward
poise one sensed her mind was work-
ing at breakneck speed boiling about
this fresh angle in the game not
once was the object of their presence
aboard ship mentioned in the course of
conversation

  i observe that you both are hardy
mariners smiled monsieur duchenin
seeing the steward there with the
broth reminds me-i dont fancy he
will be very busy with hungry passen-
gers to-day

  i dont mind the storm said sophie
haller i rather love it in fact

  the stewards were on tour with their
mid-morning trays serving broth and
biscuits one slid over to dons table
and presented his tray to monsieur du-
chenin a look one swift lightning
glance passed between them monsieur
duchenin handed a cup to the girl an-
other to don took one himself

  to our better acquaintance he said
raising his cup

  don chuckled as he sipped the broth
bit into a biscuit this was a situation
to his liking both old vandyke and the
girl were like coiled fencers under their
calm exteriors-hed bet they were sit-
ting on needles and pins don yawned
behind his hand lit a second cigarette
that didnt taste so good somehow
that damned soup had upset his stom-
ach seemed like maybe something in
it didnt agree with the hot rum punch
anyhow the boat seemed to be riding a
great deal rougher-

  his eyes roving around the lounge
suddenly fixed upon a brass porthole
rim for the space of perhaps two
seconds he looked full into another pair
of eyes peering through the aperture
two basilisk eyes fixed upon him in a
deadly inscrutable stare cold hard
implacable they were and venomous
as a snakes they registered him a
brief moment and were gone

  he had not seen anything of the face
below the hooked nose because of the
porthole rim but those eyes were the
eyes of gibboso the leper-they could
belong to nobody else

  quite unexpectedly don kincaid ex-
cused himself with a nod of apology
and walked quickly from the lounge
but the deck outside was deserted and
he stood regarding it with an uneasy
feeling if that had been the hunch-
back he had made a lightning get-away
don steadied himself against the wall of
the cabin as his stomach turned end for
end for a moment he thought he was
going to retch then walking a bit un-
certainly he turned and made his way
below

  monsieur duchenin and sophie
haller conversed a little while longer
then the girl excused herself on the plea
of having letters to write she had not
noticed the face in the window nor
had duchenin but she had noted the
abrupt departure of kincaid and won-
dered quite a bit about his failure to


the popular magazine

return monsieur duchenin with a
warm and very polite smile saw her go
waited a minute longer then departed

  once around the corner of the deck
house his careless gait quickened he
strode forward briskly and made his
way to b deck with sly glances at the
cabin faces he passed without hesita-
tion to suite b no one was in sight
as he turned into the alley containing
this suite paused at the door listened
tried the handle

  the door was locked of course
monsieur duchenin smiled took a queer
sort of key from a pocket and inserted
it into the keyhole twelve seconds la-
ter he entered the cabin flung a swift
look about then quietly locked the door

  the cabin parlor was empty and
monsieur duchenin went straight to the
first bedroom don kincaid fully
dressed sprawled upon the bed his face
pale and beads of sweat on lips and
forehead sick perhaps very certainly
asleep the vandyked visitor gave him
one attentive look then peered into the
second cabin bob gaines muttering
incoherently and more than half uncon-
scious was hors de combat

  monsieur duchenin smiled slightly
turned back to kincaids cabin

  in it were two suitcases and a
steamer trunk duchenin went through
the luggage very systematically with
scrupulous care he disarranged nothing
replacing everything just as he found it
then very expertly he searched the
cabin the drawing-room bath looked
in every nook and cranny in impossible
places shook his head in exaspera-
tion stared with a frown at the out-
stretched figure of kincaid a moment
then stepped over to him

  slowly yet deftly he pulled dons
clothes off carefully going over each
article he examined his shoes closely
the lining of his coat and topcoat ex-
amined more closely dons hair stared
speculatively at the red scratch along
dons side and furrow across his arm
at the ellipsical cicatrice on his left

breast he regarded the daubs of
monkey blood dotting kincaids legs the
slivers of skin rubbed here and there
then sat down lit a cigarette and cursed
softly uncle of satan

  appears to have quite a case of ec-
zema continued monsieur duchenin
aloud to himself also mein freund
you are either mighty wise or mighty
foolish i suspect that you have left
the papers for the present in the most
obvious hiding place-inside the sten-
dahl helmet we shall see

  he left the cabin and regained his
own just as the first luncheon call was
sounding the pigmyish east indian
attended him moving about like a dark
shadow does the sahib have suc-
cess he asked softly in lahore
tongue

  presently nodded duchenin in like
language yes presently even the
fleetest horse cannot escape its own tail
bamjee

  he laughed a little and was preparing
to depart for the dining saloon when
there came a tap at his door the deck
steward the one who had carried the
broth stepped furtively in and closed it
behind him

  monsieur duchenin nodded and drew
out his wallet he took out five hun-
dred-lire notes and tendered them to
the italian the steward bowed greas-
ily i trust the signor is satisfied with
my services he said suavely

  quite replied monsieur duchenin
visualizing the unconscious figure of
don kincaid grazie i may need
you again some time paolo

  at your command signor

  monsieur duchenin waited until the
fellow had departed then adjusted his
cravat and scrutinized his reflection in
the mirror before going to the dining
room he seemed rather pleased with
himself picking a tiny white tablet
from his vest pocket he placed it care-
fully in a small stoppered bottle

  one little pill-and such a little
one he mused one wouldnt think
the werewolfs helmet



it could make a big man sleep like the
dead for some six hours yet thats
what it will do yes i fear my friend
herr kincaid will have a slight head-
ache late this afternoon

  he turned to the watchful bamjee

  you will keep most alert this day-
the remainder of it it may be that
some attempt will be made upon my
person by the tiger-eyed man in suite
b b deck and i do not wish unpleas-
antness

  all is understood sahib i watch
bamjee nodded grimly

  it was a coldly alert and somewhat
disgruntled donald kincaid that ap-
peared on deck the following day that
he had been doped and his rooms
searched he well knew and he was
pretty positive that duchenin was the
perpetrator still nothing had been
taken and after all there was no actual
proof whoever was responsible had
made a nice water haul that was cer-
tain but the memory of those malig-
nant eyes he had seen at the lounge port-
hole pestered him like a loose tooth and
he wore the black barreled luger
snugged firmly against his midriff

  the weather though still rough and
galelike had quieted considerably in
the night which don had put in in un-
easy slumber yet nothing had hap-
pened despite his precautions break-
fast finished he walked briskly about
the decks the last ill effects of the white
pill gone and he was trusting no one
that day not any

  there was a marconigram for him
from gina strozzi brief and to the
point don smiled crookedly as he read
it

donald f kincaid

      s s cesare battisti

  spies aboard be careful every minute in
case of trouble notify captain colonna he
will make any arrest on your complaint

m di s

  that wireless message were it true
gave him a mighty stiff whip hand that

morning should he care to use it he
had but to speak a word to this captain
colonna of the battisti and the ship
would be searched from stem to stern
for baroffio the knife and gibboso the
hunchback a second word would put
monsieur duchenin of london or so-
phie haller of luxemburg in the brig

  yet would it there was no actual
proof on any of them so far on the
voyage and any of them could make
countercharges against him don kin-
caid that would cause a great deal of
embarrassment and delay in clearing up
no matter however don wasnt in-
tending to use this power the helmet
was safely locked up in the pursers
charge and don wanted to be under no
more obligations to gina strozzi than
could be helped

  he met monsieur duchenin soon
afterward on deck their paths cross-
ing

  care to join me in a bowl of broth
don asked meaningly i didnt think
much of the flavor of yours yesterday
naturally not smiled vandyke
brazenly i trust the headache was not
overly inconvenient

  no said don may i ask what
in the hell kind of condiment you used 
to be sure it was threlanium-
speyers solution the effrontery of
the man was amazing he made no bones
about being guilty they are very ef-
fective pills herr kincaid

  so i noticed don nodded dryly
very too bad you had to waste one
monsieur x youre good but not
quite good enough

  apparently agreed duchenin quite
unruffled but i almost satisfied my-
self that you have really placed the pa-
pers in the helmet

  in which case advised don mock-
ingly youd better try one of your
k o drops on the purser

  it might not be a bad idea said
monsieur duchenin could i trouble
you for a match msieu 

  while tendering his box of vestas


the popular magazine

dons fingers came in contact with the
marconigram which he had thrust in his
coat pocket on the spur of the mo-
ment he offered it to monsieur du-
chenin to read

  what would you do if you had a
weapon like that in your arsenal he
asked pointedly a curious glint in his
keen eyes

  duchenin read the message handed it
back to don with his swordfish smile
i rather think he replied slowly
that id do just as you are intending
doing with it mein freund aunt of
the devil yes

  don laughed and passed on amused
monsieur duchenin made no bones
about his knavery at least not with kin-
caid but as don continued updeck
fists thrust in the pockets of his trench
coat and plaid cap slightly aslant he saw
the swart-faced hindu shadow of du-
chenins slide unobtrusively behind a
ventilator

  don scanned the fellow closely as he
walked by but said nothing bamjees
eyes slid in almond-shaped slots toward
the american then became dull and
filmed don knew those opaque orbs
were sliding up and down his back and
he had a ticklish sensation about his
throat and under his left shoulder blade

  the day dragged slowly and toward
late afternoon the sky began to lighten
a little the wind to lose its howling
tempo the battisti was plowing out
of the storm center and a ships officer
told don that they expected to be clear
of the disturbance before morning at
dinner that night don saw sophie
haller and afterward they sat in the
lounge for coffee and cigarettes

  to-morrow night we raise gibral-
tar he remarked and our play is
drawing close to curtain lady turpin
im a little bit sorry

  it is yet many leagues to italy the
girl answered with a shrug dont let
appearances deceive you mr kincaid

with the passing of every hour your
chances of success grow less not
greater

  well don said cheerfully the
party who slipped sleepy drops in my
broth yesterday then later ransacked
my quarters saw his chance of coup
considerably lessened he or she was
efficient but out of luck

   stephanie graetz alias sophie haller
looked at him a long moment very curi-
ously i did not trick you yesterday
mr kincaid she said quietly but
i think you know that and the mon-
ocled monsieur x of london found
nothing of interest

  dont know about that but he
didnt enlighten himself greatly in re
the barbarossa helmet if hed knocked
out the purser and rooted about the
ships strong box- but thats an-
other thing again

   i wish said the girl slowly yes
i wish i knew for certain that the thing
i seek is truly in the helmet it seems
so futile so imbecile for you to die
american

  thats as may be retorted don
but i appreciate your sympathy yes
indeed

   it pleases you to make the fun she
said coldly is it possible that you do
not yet realize the danger of your

course 

  not very possible but why fence
you and i there is an orchestra in
the ballroom-a slick floor and good
music lets dance drink a bottle of
the imprisoned laughter of the peasant
girls of france and forget there was
ever such a thing as stendahls helmet
and a lot of damned intrigue and treach-
ery what do you say 

  i say yes  replied stephanie
quickly her eyes like bits of turquoise
beneath their raven black lashes her
white teeth flashing in a scarlet smile
i will meet you in half an hour on the
promenade

the old payne mine

  by general rafael de nogales

  tke man wko b ears a ckarmed life escapes being

    buried al ive

i was in nevada during the famous
goldfield boom of  and 
having just drifted down from
alaska when i got there my luggage
consisted of a toothbrush a toothpick
and a pair of extra socks my working
capital had dwindled down to half a
dollar but i carried with me a letter
of introduction to a noted lawyer and
glorious booze fighter by the initials of
mr k p which soon got me back
on my feet again probably because its
contents were short but very much to
the point all it said was kid men-
dez is one of those fellows who want
only a starter he will do the rest

  owing to my facility of adapting my-
self to new circumstances i had after
a years permanence-at the beginning
of which i knew practically nothing of
quartz mining-become director of sev-
eral quartz mining companies this
meant that i was now a millionaire on
paper i had ridden the paper storm
that had fluttered over the gold boom
and was sitting on top of a pile of it

  nevertheless i had not managed to
reach the heights of my youthful ambi-
tion  i wanted to be president of a full-
fledged mining or leasing company of
my own i could easily have started a
wildcat company as so many of the
other mining operators were doing but
i was too proud for that i wanted
to get hold of a real mine but that was
about as difficult to find in nevada in
those days as a six-footed hippopotamus
on broadway

  with that purpose in mind i put on
my chaps spurs and stetson mounted
outlaw and hit the trail in the direc-
tion of eureka which had been a flour-
ishing mining camp in the days of the
silver boom there were plenty of old
abandoned mines strewn over the desert
which might serve my purpose i knew
some of them because i had visited that
district before during my cow-puncher
days in arizona we had drifted into
it by hazard-frenchy the cook of
our outfit lanky the killer and
myself we had set after a bunch of
stray cows which were headed for the
needles near the colorado canyon in
those days tenderfeet were sort of scarce
around those parts of nevada game
on the other hand was plentiful

  one day-maybe it was the tenth
maybe the twentieth after we had
started out on our wild-goose chase-
while walking our cayuses around an
alkali flat frenchy straightened up in
the saddle and pointed with his knotty
fist in the direction of a row of boulders
near the foot of a red butte toward our
right owing to the glare of the sun i
failed to discover what he was pointing
at but lanky had seen it and loosen-
ing his rope plunged the spurs into the
flanks of his pinto pony and was off like
a streak of lightning in the direction of
the boulders with frenchy close on his
heels

  feeling kind of lonesome i took after
them at breakneck speed it did not
take me long to find out what was keep-


the popular magazine

ing them bent down over their horses

- necks it was a she-grizzly bear with a
  couple of cubs and she was trying to
  make a get-away by heading at top
  speed in the direction of the row of
  boulders but we got there first

    and while lanky and frenchy were
  holding the old lady each by a paw
  with their ropes i was trying to man-
  euver around her so as to drop my
  noose over her head but outlaw my
  cayuse was so plumb scared at the sight
  of her foaming fangs and glowing eyes
  that i had to jump off in order to get
  a bead at the missus she was a sight
  for the gods mad as hell and growling
  to beat the band

    if one of those ropes had burst and
  she had taken me in her loving arms she
  would have squeezed the life out of
  me but somehow or other i managed
  it with a couple of shots for she-bears
  are generally hard to kill especially
  when they have cubs and are mad

    several years had passed since we
  had pulled off that bear hunt-happily
  without registering any broken bones-
  and there i was again riding through
  those alkali flats and red porphyry hills
  in quest of something more tangible
  than a she-bear skin unfortunately
  most of the old mines which i came
  across had been relocated by profes-
  sional blanketers or were not worth
  while bothering with so i headed due
  west and after crossing the amargosa
  desert and death valley climbed the
  panamint range and entered inyo
  county california in search of an
  abandoned silver mine to lease or to take
  an option on in those days that was
  sufficient warrant to issue-and float-
  a million shares and even to put the
  suckers into a sweat to get the first
  lot of its treasury stock

    finally after much nosing around i
  came upon the old payne mine the
  mine had been abandoned forty years
  before during the comstock boom be-
  cause its owners had run beyond the

silver at the eight-hundred-foot level
and hit copper sulphides it was situ-
ated some twenty miles from darwin
against a barren mountain east of keeler
lake

  it was by picking up an abandoned
silver mine and incorporating it as a
copper mine that a senator had appar-
ently made his millions and why
shouldnt i make a few dollars out of
the old payne mine if not by producing
copper at least by selling treasury stock
to a willing and eager market

   as soon as i had my plan straightened
out in my mind i started out with win-
kelmann a german assayer for the
mine winkelmann was a good assayer
but also a sort of a better-class hobo i
had picked him up in a chinese joint
near keeler almost starved to death
the poor fellow had left louisiana for
san francisco as a blind passenger-on
an empty freight car-until a heartless
conductor kicked him off the train and
abandoned him to his fate in the heart
of the mojave desert

  there he had wandered for days
near thirsting to death until one after-
noon he crawled on hands and knees
into johannesbourg south of death val-
ley his hands were lacerated and his
lips torn to pieces by the thorns of the
cactus trees into which he had sunk his
teeth again and again in a mad effort to
quench his thirst

  thence he had proceeded to keeler
in search of work the terrible tortures
which he had undergone had unbalanced
his mind while riding through the
desert he would suddenly point at the
sun and shout in agony at the top of his
voice-dont you dare making faces
at me again you blankety coward

   after a couple of days we arrived at
the mine it was turned into a heap of
ruins from behind some bony derricks
and dilapidated windlasses a couple of
slinking coyotes dashed noiselessly into
the near-by sagebrushes the skeleton
of a horse lay bleaching in front of the
the old payne mine



main shaft overgrown with scraggy
weeds sinking back into the mountain
in an inclined plane

  it looked insecure so we looked
around for a more reassuring one which
would lead us into the bottom of the
mine after some nosing around we
came upon a vertical shaft near the old
tool house

  it was adequately timbered and a
twenty-pound rock we dropped into it
proved by its sound that its depth was
not less than eight hundred feet the
rock splashed at the bottom showing
that the shaft was flooded but owing
to the dry desert air the timbered walls
had been well preserved

  it would have taken us too long to
rig up a windlass to lower ourselves by
so we decided to climb down a series of
rickety ladders which nailed to the
wooden sides of the shaft formed an
unbroken path more fit for wild cats
than for men in those days my favor-
ite sport was crawling over high ledges
on my belly in quest of wild sheep and
winkelmann was a plodding soul who
believed that anything if done method-
ically was bound to turn out right

  we accordingly tied our horses to the
tool house slung our prospecting ham-
mers from our belts and each with a
lighted candle tied to his hat we started
down the shaft i went in first and was
about twenty yards ahead of the assayer
i must have been about one hundred feet
below the surface when a creaking
sound overhead made my heart jump
into my throat

  before i could climb two rungs i
saw with horror how the upper part of
the section of the ladder to which i was
clinging detached itself slowly from the
wall planking and fell with a thud
against the opposite wall leaving me
hanging in mid-air like an acrobat from

a lopsided trapeze while my candle
having gone out the dark shaft seemed
bottomless below my feet

  fortunately i did not lose my head
but managed to shout a warning to win-
kelmann sizing up the situation in a
second he scrambled out of the shaft
as fast as he could and in record time
came back from the tool house with a
rope one end of which he tied to a
pole outside the shaft while the other
end with an iron hook attached he
tossed to me somehow i managed to
grasp the hook with my numbed right
while holding to the ladder with my
other hand and one leg that i had thrust
between two rungs

  in this position i fumbled for what
seemed like hours-and were probably
seconds-to fasten the rope around my
chest and under my armpits while my
left hand was crying to relax its hold
on the ladder

  i had barely arranged the rope about
me and secured it with the hook when
the fingers of my left hand gave way
entirely and i dropped the rope was
slack and i felt myself flying through
the darkness to the flooded bottom of
the shaft

  time slows up in a crisis and it
seemed that i must be ready to hit
the bottom and break my neck when
instead i felt the sudden jerk of the
rope under my arms and stopped sharp
in the middle of the air

  then with what seemed a tremendous
exertion to my ragged muscles i began
to pull myself up slowly scrambling
with my feet along the slippery planking
of the shaft wall until i reached the top
and fainted dead away in the sunlight

  that experience i believe is a fine
cure for the disease of looking for cop-
per in a silver mine for the purpose of
issuing paper

watch for another exciting nogales adventure
tke peace
     of hells kitchen

by joseph iveks lawrence

twas a gr-r-rand foiglitl

p eems like it all happened in half
a minute john rooney told his
family but then again it seemed
whole hours before we got goin the
lieutenant got the hot tip over the wire
and didnt wait for anything packed
the six of us in a taxi right off and
we made the larrimore plant without
hittin moren three high spots on the
way he said hed follow us up in two
minutes with tear gas an machine guns
but when we sleued round the corner

next to larrimores they were unloading
the pay roll from their own car with a

the peace of hells kitchen



tiges gang gets in say and how
seemed like gunmen popped up out o
the slots in the car tracks everybody
shootin-all over the place when round
the corner comes the patrol car sprayin
cops like a street sprinkler and then
right out o the windshield of a green
taxi comes a burst from a machine gun
-one o them big automatics

  they got three of us right off y
know and then we begun diggin in
say two-hundred-pound coppers got
behind six-inch lamp-posts i guess
some of em went down manholes
there was a gunman blazin away from
behind the counter of an orangeade
stand an a cop got im shootin from
inside a concrete mixer

  tige lavin was in command hidin
behind the larrimore steel car an i
quit firin for a minute an slipped round
to look for im

  th blessed saints preserve us
groaned john rooneys mother her
staring eyes reproducing the scene in
the narrow parlor of the apartment

  goin round the rear end john con-
tinued i seen tige not ten feet off
an he seen me i pulled down me gat
an squeezed er-but not a catridge in
th clip tiges bullet went through my
cap an then i tackled im-just like
football tige aint heavy but hes
wiry he give me a fight all right
believe me i was gettin all i wanted
but i got a swipe at im with the butt
o me gun

  thats all he sighed a little breath-
lessly some cops piled on top of us
to make sure of tige-an then tiges
gang sort o petered out he was some
general that guy there wont be no
more gang without im hell get life
this time they say

  and youll get a medal john pre-
dicted ed ryan gravely ed was the
husband of johns sister minnie and a
promising young lawyer prominent in
ward politics

  a medal sure agreed johns
  pop-b

mother and hell be a sergeant too

about

  a medal is ut growled grand-
father rooney from his armchair an
a sargint is ut arrah shtir up th
fire a bit nora darlin its that cowld
i am its on th hob o the grate id

  it was a gas log that needed stirring
and minnie ryan laughed gently as she
turned up the flame while little grand-
mother nora bustled about to get her
man a shawl for his poor old knees

  dont fret granpaw john said
kindly we all know the old days
were the big days sure i wouldnt be
half the cop i am if i didnt have the
blood of mike rooney in my veins
ed ryan chuckled with an indulgent
nod to the old man

  it always did take a he-man to be
a new york cop he conceded but
to-day you got to admit that crimes
getting scientific-highly organized-
its run on a big scale no sentiment
about it cold-blooded-all worked
out on paper like a business brains
behind it you know-and it takes brains
and real guts to meet it

  dont be vulgar ed protested
minnie darting a reproving glance at
her husband over the tiny vanity mirror
and powder compact with which she was
engaged at the moment

  grandfather rooney fidgeted with his
bony knees under the shawl

  its real war these gangsters and
racketeers are carrying on persisted
ed earnestly theyve got their artil-
lery and infantry as it were theyve
even used airplanes in some places you
know were living in big times and
even crime is carried on in a big way
aw hell exploded the grandfa-
ther and his old black pipe fell from
a shaking hand

  ah now mike come along wid

suasively gathering him into her frail

thin arms come mike darlin twas
yer bedtime an hour ago

  the old man got slowly to his feet
glaring a challenge to all persons in the
family circle but saw only kindly smiles
-patient smiles which did little enough
to allay his ill humor

  drawn insistently toward the door by
grandmother he hobbled out into the
long hall of the apartment and allowed
himself to be guided to his room by the
devoted hands a soft kiss on his with-
ered cheek going far to soften his mood

  itll be near fifty years nora he
mumbled softly as they gained their
door yit-god love yer darlin-its
like yistiddy it seems

  alderman kilfoyles house was on
thirty-third street in a quiet residence
block untouched by the sinister influ-
ence of the powerful gang which had
fixed the name of hells kitchen on a
considerable section of the middle west
side

  there were two ailanthus trees and
some flower beds in alderman kil-
foyles back yard and in the smaller
area in front of the house were lilacs
and syringas and a low hawthorn hedge

  by the flowering lilac bush nora kil-
foyle was standing her face shaming the
spring blossoms with its freshness and
color a glorified sunbonnet of blue
silk framed the pertly tilted head match-
ing the eyes and inside the flaring brim
was a garland of tiny pink roses which
paled beside the maiden blushes

  good day to ye miss kilfoyle
said patrolman michael rooney with
only a sickly sort of a smile

  yerself knows theres no need of
miscalling me like that mike rooney
protested the damsel with an indignant
toss of her head im still nora to me

of the roguish radiant smile that her
friends knew her by is it for love o

red-headed policeman when i might
have a fine gentleman who walks with a
gold-headed cane  ill ask ye that
there was a sizzling retort on the
tip of mikes tongue but he caught it
between his teeth as noras flippancy
gave way to grave concern

  oh mike she whispered its aw-
ful angry my father is this very minute

duce mr steele to some of his friends

hensively a little quaver in her voice

  its me job to keep folks out o

shoulders square head up patrolman
rooney marched down eighth avenue
swinging his club with a savage little
snap of the cord at every step
the peace of hells kitchen



  he caught sight of leather-faced
harry hoskins cruising with his han-
som cab and hailed him

  have ye seen gintleman george
steele th day harry

  i ave responded the cabby curtly
mr steele will tyke no other ansom
when mines for ire a gentleman like
im knows a good whip an a good orse
though its little to is credit es at
hoscar the dutchmans plyce right now
drinkin is bloody ead orf

  mike asked no more questions but
hurried along and presently pushed
through the swinging doors of the fam-
ily entrance to oscar schmidts saloon
and found himself in interesting com-
pany

  in the oak-paneled back room with
its plate-glass mirrors and marble-topped
tables were five persons known to the
police but not with warm affection or
high regard

  two of them were members and ac-
tive agents of the dead rabbit gang
on the east side jake lozier a minor
chief in the citys toughest clan and
greaser pete a swarthy giant who
first entered the port of new york as a
kanaka sailor

  george steele whom mike rooney
was seeking sat at a round table his
back to the rear wall and was flanked
by two women of amazonian build
babe mullins a pink-and-white heifer
who tipped the scales at fifteen stone
and dopey dora kent a spare but
stalwart woman flabby-faced and dull-
eyed-yet showing pathetic traces of a
physical grandeur that ruin had not en-
tirely obliterated

 the two women passed a stone
schnapps bottle back and forth between
them but steele the elegant rounder
affected brandy floats after his habit
he wore a freshly ironed silk topper set
at a rakish angle a prince albert coat
with lavender trousers and gray spats
and an ascot scarf held with a star-
sapphire set in brilliants

  what t hell do you want rooney 
challenged jake lozier fishy eyes shift-
ing nervously

  th back o me hand to yer jake
sneered the patrolman from a corner of
his mouth i might take a mug o lager
to lay the dust in me throat but ye
neednt be thinkin its con-jaynial com-
pany im lookin for in this place

  an now he added gruffly be that
as it may what the divil ye doin here
yerself this side o broadway hells
kitchen is no place for a five pointer
-even when the suns shinin

  get on yer job mike piped babe
mullins the lousy sheenys come
over to throw a scare into mr steele
shut your trap babe snapped
george steele and nonchalantly stroked
his pomaded mustaches but his fingers
trembled

  theres no business for a brass-but-
toned crusher here lozier snarled sav-
agely go pound yer beat show yer
face south o houston street an therell
be a dead mick in the gutter

  git back to hester street where ye
belong ordered mike or bedacl
therell be kosher cat meat scattered
round eight avenoo

  lozier screwed his mobile counte-
nance into a bulldog grimace and got
slowly to his feet at the same time
the gorilla-faced greaser pete rose to
six feet of solid muscle back of the
table

  gentleman george jerked a short der-
ringer from under his arm and covered
the kanaka as the latter made a move-
ment toward his belt

  mike rooney waited for no more
his locust club flashed in the air and
cracked on the head of jake lozier
with the sound of a bat hitting a pump-
kin the east sider crashed down be-
hind the table and the baton swung
again and thudded on the massive
swarthy jowl of greaser pete stretch-
ing him beside his pal much of the
renown of new yorks finest was


the popular magazine

due to their deftness in matching mere
billets of hard wood to shooting irons
even when the gunmen were quick on
the draw and the trigger

  hit em again mike shrilled babe
mullins stomp em mash their
dirty mugs for em

  but mike was engaged in verifying
his belief that both men were armed
for battle and he collected four re-
volvers

  oscar schmidt and his waiters were
bunched in the narrow passage to the
bar chattering in their panic

  sooch a pizness groaned the pro-
prietor an i run a resbectable
blace

  a hell of a respectable place jeered
dopey dora theres no safe place
west of broadway now for a decent
woman to go you babe sew up your
filthy mouth try to be a lady-once
snuff up another pinch o coke an
go to hell returned the rosy-cheeked
amazon george likes me jest as i
am-dont you george

  but steele was gravely surveying the
casualties of the brief skirmish

  why dont you get the wagon
rooney he demanded theyll come
to in a minute

  sure you got time to git away
misther steele mike replied these
fellies will come to an theyll go home
an stay there theyll not be wishful
to cross the line agin in a month

them o the east side

  an my advice to yer misther
steele he added solemnly is that ye
go on home an sober up for a change
truth to tell i was lookin for yer
theres dacint folks expectin ye to sup-
per this very night-an in a shtate of
so-briety

  you tend to your own affairs
rooney i dont require such personal
service from the new york police

havent been drunk for a month

  but yeve been drunk for a week
to me own knowledge its a fine up-
shtandin figger of a man ye are
misther steele but when i see yer ex-
tra straight an extra dignified then i

the absint

  schmidt came to steele in a fever of
anxiety

  tree men oudt in front-across der
street he said my svede vaiter says
deyre from great chones street-ber-
haps from der dead rabbits

  then chink kurtz darted in at the
side door he was a little sallow man
with long slits for eyes which got him
his nickname when he was a lobbygow
-runner for an opium joint in china-
town he had migrated to the west
side and risen rapidly in the adminis-
trative circles of the hells kitchen
gang

  hey george he cried familiarly to
steele theys a lot o five pointers
cornin over the line i been gettin re-
ports its your putting up the dough to
get slimy osterhout sent up th river
its you theyre after and your friends
aint so very safe better hoof it to
tenth avenue-dan shaws place

mike rooney pleaded anxiously will

  they know i live at the norman-
die said steele gravely like enough
theyve got sharpshooters round there
-if theyre after me ill go to dan
shaws for a bit

  hustle then urged chink kurtz
i got bully bills hack outside
mike slipped out into the side street
he was uneasy and not minded to risk
abuscades and a possible battle in the
five points fashion he rapped the
sidewalk sharply with his club and a
flat musical note sounded above the
clatter of hoofs on the avenue with the
the peace of hells kitchen



resonance and carrying power of well-
seasoned locust wood its echo had
scarcely died away when officer tim
lafferty came running from eighth
avenue alert for trouble and he was
followed in another minute by sergeant
white who had been on an inspection
stroll

  im off post sarge said mike
but fer th love o heaven relieve me
for the day th dead rabbits are hop-
pin across broadway an theyve set
their mark on george steele leave
me arrest im or take him safe to a hide-
out i give the shtick to jake lozier
an greaser pete in dutch oscars
they was there with gintleman george
an theyd a got im sure in a minute

  better youd a stuffed them plug-
uglies with lead-in self-defense
growled the sergeant go ahead and
arrest george steele-drunk an dis-
orderly-resisting an officer-anything

  but just then as a two-horse hack
pulled up at the side door of the saloon
george steele flashed across the side-
walk and plunged into the darkened in-
terior of the vehicle valiantly convoyed
by babe mullins and dopey dora

  little chink kurtz came after them
covering the retreat but before he could
get into the hack with the massive bulk
of miss mullins blocking the door a
fusillade of pistol shots came from the
windows of a tenement across the street
and shattered the glass of the carriage

  the women caterwauled like wild
cats and the obese purple-jowled hack-
man bully bill harkness cursed ob-
scenely in a shrill treble and slashed his
bony nags with his whip till they
plunged into a wild gallop

  chink kurtz leaped for the hacks
baggage rack and perched on it and the
nimble mike rooney joined him there
gaining a precarious seat as the creaking
wheels bounded over the cobblestone
pavement

  sergeant white and patrolman laf-
ferty boldly attacked the house where

the ambush was established blowing
their whistles and smiting the sidewalk
with their sticks to summon reenforce-
ments they crashed in the basement
door and charged fiercely through halls
and tenements but found deserted
rooms an open skylight showed how
the snipers had escaped over the roofs

  the dead rabbits from the five
points district had opened hostilities
but evidently were not yet in sufficient
force to venture a skirmish with their
west side gang enemies or with the
police a general alarm had flashed
through the district however and
white and lafferty came out of the
house to find the street crowded with
hoodlums just as lieutenant mgurk
of the precinct station arrived at dutch
oscars in a patrol wagon with a squad
of bluecoats

  dan shaws royal palace on the
east side of tenth avenue was a spa-
cious beer garden and dance hall and
a popular resort of well-to-do pan-
handlers floppers yeggs pickpockets
drug peddlers and addicts with the fe-
males of the species all under the pro-
tection and supervision of the hells
kitchen gang

  the proprietor a calm mild-man-
nered little man with square shoulders
and a bullet head greeted the hack load
or fugitives at the front door of his
place and was outwardly unruffled at
the hysteria of the women and the
tremulous haste of gentleman george

  chink sent me word he said
quietly as they all chattered in his face
git inside george-and keep these
loud-mouthed mabs from yellin

  chink kurtz hustled steele and the
women through the doors and mike
rooney stopped for a word with shaw

  its a nee-farious business dan he
muttered dubiously eight an nint
avenoos has dead rabbits hoppin like
fleas on dogs th cops will hold em
mebbe if i git a patrol wagon ill run
george to the station house an lock


the popular magazine

im up till he can git off to saratoga
for his healt

  hes yeller george is shaw re-
marked with wild disdain but-give
im credit-hes stuck by the gang
many a good lad would be up the river
now if twant for him and see the
trouble its brought im along with the
slimy osterhout case

  steele and the two women were con-
ducted to the dance hall at the rear-the
citadel in times of storm and stress and
they were received sullenly by a few
of such denizens of the water front as
were wont to venture out in daylight

  kitty may a petite blonde turned up
a shapely nose at babe mullins

  cunnin little doll-baby aint she
a longshoreman who had been danc-
ing with kitty guffawed harshly and
miss mullins placed a pudgy thumb to
her nose and twiddled her fingers at the
pair

  thank god i aint a dried-up pea-
nut  she said fervently and added
other metaphors as her imagination be-
gan to function

  kitty pertly consigned her to the uni-
versal rendezvous for all who are de-
spised and the nervous george steele
tactfully proposed drinks for the crowd
at his expense gin was the prevail-
ing order and some west siders wanted
spirits of camphor added to theirs for
an extra kick while one huge stevedore
demanded a dash of benzine

  got some good straight alcohol
dopey dora asked a polite brute of a
waiter all right give it just a squirt
of ether im from uptown im not
accustomed to tenth avenue manners
and i need a bracer

  i misdoubt theres any trouble cornin
here dan mike rooney was saying
to the proprietor out by the bar th
shpalpeens thought to git george aisy-
like but the po-lice has turned em
back

  three men came in and draped them-
selves along the bar

  dead rabbits exclaimed the alert
mike starting forward out wid yer
theys saloons east o broadway fer the
likes o yer

  they hung on the bar and leered at
him

  chase yerself flatfoot said one
we got a right to drink aint we

  youse mugs do like th cop says
growled a giant barkeep and brought
a heavy bungstarter from under the bar

  one of the invaders flashed a re-
volver from a shoulder holster and shot
the bartender through the chest

  dan shaw roared a rallying call and
a flying wedge of strong-arm waiters
charged from the rear room but they
met a phalanx of the enemy which
stormed through the double doors
wielding bludgeons and blackjacks a
boatload of east siders had landed in
an oyster dock on west street the
dead rabbits were hopping in hells
kitchen and taking its forces on an un-
protected flank

  the new york gangster like the sav-
age warrior of the jungle relied on
sound and fury to awe an enemy and
the crashing of shattered mirrors and
glass bar furnishings answered the first
burst of gunfire followed by piercing
shrieks from the women in the back
room

  a bartender lay dying among beer
pumps and broken glass and his three
comrades in their white coats and aprons
vaulted the bar and joined the heavy-
weight flying squadron of waiters in
their effort to repulse the surprise at-
tack mighty fists hard and horny as
hoofs cracked jawbones brass knuck-
les slung shots butcher knives and pis-
tols came into play in the tumultuous
free-for-all and huskies went down
in the sawdust and turned it from dirty
yellow to glistening crimson

 a red-headed slasher from five
points fell with his head lodging gro-
tesquely in a large brass cuspidor which
handily caught the blood from a gash
the peace of hells kitchen



in his neck and one of the stalwart
waiters stomped him there jumping
on his back and neck till the red-haired
gory head was locked in the bent and
twisted brass frame of the cuspidor

  patriotism was a quality not always
lacking in the metropolitan thug but in
the heat of battle a dead rabbit tore
a framed portrait of president ruther-
ford b hayes from the wall above the
bar and crashed it on the head of dan
shaw who was urging his cohort to a
fierce defense picture and glass were
torn and shattered and the stoical little
proprietor wore the frame like a horse
collar but with his battered bald head
bleeding from a dozen cuts he retreated
slowly toward the back room deliber-
ately aiming his revolver and firing
wherever he spotted a proper human
target

  mike rooney sole representative of
law and order smote every hostile head
that came within reach of his locust
stick and as a duty he roared threats
and commands in the name of the law
but no one was minded to be bothered
about the law in tenth avenue at the
moment

  george steele was not in the fray
but he was in the minds of mike rooney
and dan shaw as they backed toward
the big room where he was hiding-a
politician of some influence and wealth
must be guarded-and they were plan-
ning the next move as the dead rabbits
advanced when a fresh tumult with
crashing glass and rending planks told
them that another squad of the east
side gangsters had stormed the side en-
trance to the dance hall and battered
in the barred doors

  shaw rallied his waiters and charged
to the rear with mike rooney and in
an instant they had the foe before them
and behind them

  steeles shining topper was smashed
on the floor and a blow had bruised one
of his eyes he had discharged the
futile pocket derringer and now

guarded himself with a chair held in
front of him his face was white he
looked dazed and uncertain but still
he maintained something of dignity and
fought against sheer panic

  dopey dora shrieked and cursed im-
pressively babe mullins fought like a
warlock her pudgy hands were not as
soft as they looked and they carried
stunning wallops to the foes that came
within reach men who came back at
her she engaged hand to hand and then
her nails ripped and tore into flesh

  a five pointer kicked her in the solar
plexus for a knock-out but howling
and heaving for breath she grappled
him she got a hold on an ear with her
big white teeth and when the man
writhed and jerked himself loose he left
the lobe of the ear in her mouth she
spat out the grisly trophy with a mouth-
ful of blood and as the bewildered thug
staggered away she kicked him in the
face and floored him

  croak the filthy rat yelled a gang-
ster and a bullet creased the roll of fat
which formed a thick shield for babes
jugular vein

  she reviled the enemy in a vocabulary
richer than theirs and would have
charged into a rain of bullets but mike
rooney caught and flung her aside then
fired two shots among the feet that
milled about the floor in front of him

  rattling gunfire broke out again in
the front saloon and there was a heavy
tramping of feet the dead rabbits in
the dance hall swirled about the door
and began firing toward the street

  th po-lice yelled mike jubilantly
mgurk an the ree-serves have came
sure its a grand fight

  lieutenant mgurks powerful voice
could be heard demanding surrender
but the five pointers jeered and howled
him down they outnumbered the po-
lice three to one and they were handy
with guns shooting from the hip or tak-
ing deliberate aim

  bully bills got his hack round the

corner if he aint croaked whispered
chink kurtz suddenly with a wary eye
on the shifting battle its your chance
to give em the slip george one of
em will plug you yet if this keeps on
im surprised youre alive

  go-go now-fer th love o th

ern an git a light rig to take yer to-
to-th furder th better

  cmon george cried the battle-
scarred and bleeding babe im with
ye george

  now the police clubs were cracking
on heads in the saloon with a sort of
rhythm and there were groans and
yells as of embattled armies

  steele his oiled hair tousled one eye
darkening and closing reeled in a stupor
of bewilderment toward the wrecked
side entrance babe shoved him
through it over the debris and dora
shambled after them the alert and
efficient chink kurtz went too to engi-
neer their escape

  mike heaved a profound sigh of re-
lief wagged his head and tenderly
rubbed a score of bruises on his limbs
and body then he gripped his locust
in a powerful right hand jammed his
helmet well down to the tops of his
ears and started for the front line of
combat

  hoo-roo he shouted blithely and
plunged into the fray

  tenth avenue was quiet as the dusk
gathered in the ruins of dan shaws
royal palace lay four deceased dead
rabbits a bullet-riddled barkeep and
two dead policemen mgurk had a
dozen thugs to load into the patrol
wagon for a ride to the jug the eve-
ning was coming on peacefully

  the rest of the five pointers de-
feated by superior tactics and leadership
had faded from the scene slipping away
like foxes north south east west

  the lieutenant told mike to go home
and rest and mike dusted off his uni-
foririj punched out a deep dent in his
helmet and started walking east

  at eighth avenue he saw a cop run-
ning and hailed him for information

  trouble aplenty answered the cop
they say george steeles in another
mess theres a riot eight avener
an thoity-thoid-

  mary-mother-av-mercy gasped
mike th dom fool didnt know
enough ter keep on going th black
curse be on im if hes made trouble

  the gangs are out the other cop
informed him been cornin cross
town in street cars an cabs dead rab-
bits an everthing-moren ever an
the hells kitchen boys are out after em
-cornin uptown an downtown its
gang war georgie steele will be get-
tin mashed between em

  lave off yer gab an come on cried
mike and started running

  northward and eastward he ran the
other patrolman panting close behind
him they came to eighth avenue and
thirty-third street and there was no
fighting there but they heard the din
of battle close by they sprinted east-
ward and saw the street ahead of them
crowded with milling struggling men
and the air above full of soaring brick-
bats and sticks

  kilfoyles house it is gasped mike
and got a firm grip on his club

  a moment later he tore into a scrim-
mage of gang against gang where the
bluecoats were fanning their sticks lust-
ily one head as good a billet as another

  nora kilfoyles little front garden
bloomed no longer the lilacs were gone
and the yard was like one plowed and
harrowed hedges and fences were
torn away from the house all about the
aldermans and there was not a window
left intact in the neighborhood

  of the police there were reserves
from four precinct stations with their
the peace of hells kitchen

i



officers but in the ranks of the outlaws
were partisan contingents from almost
every settled ward of the city-some of
them giving gory evidence of their
allegiance to the hells kitchen thugs
while as many more paid strenuous
homage to the men that ruled the east
side from the battery to harlem

  alderman david kilfoyle came out
on the high stoop of his house and ad-
dressed the contending armies it was
evidently not the first attempt he had
made at conciliation and compromise
for his head was bandaged and his
clothing was shredded to rags and
fringe

  now i tell yer he roared hoarsely
you must stop-in the name of the
mayor of new york-in the name of
the governor of the state-

  he was cut off in mid-career a
hard-flung egg found the aldermanic
nose a tempting mark and his already
rumpled white waistcoat was quickly
decorated in a fantastic pattern of yel-
low and claret color

  got im on th conk jeered an east
sider in the yard trow out de
bloke yer got inside or well move off
yer house

   kilf oylo pressed a kerchief to his nose
and gurgled trying to swear a ruta-
baga caught him in the chest and
knocked him against the front door and
he fell inside gladly allowing some one
to draw him farther in and slam the
door shut

  the green-grocers stand at the corner
of seventh avenue had been plundered
for bricks and stones were scarce and
turnips potatoes and onions were ef-
fective on window glass and human
faces while eggs in quantity messed
things up generally to the satisfaction
of the mob

  further reenforcements for the east
side barbarians now advancing from
seventh avenue drew the attention of
the police to that quarter and a dozen
thugs seized the looked-for opportunity

to make a dash for the kilfoyle front
door

  it was a swift dash a bold impulsive
stroke but mike rooney and tim laf-
ferty his friend saw the beginning of
it and were on the stoop with the first
of the gangsters to reach it clubbing
heads right and left fighting to guard
the door

  the rush of the men at the rear how-
ever carried those in front like a wave
against the door and burst it inward
the two policemen and the dead rab-
bit hoodlums were in alderman kil-
foyles house fighting in the narrow
hall crowded so there was scarcely room
to kick or strike a man

  the big walnut newel post was ripped
from its base and the stair rail went
with it the hall stand went to pieces
fragments of its mirror chinking among
walking sticks and umbrellas men
caught up the carved balusters from
the broken rail and used them for clubs
as the alderman and half a dozen friends
and servants crowded forward from the
parlor to repel the invasion

  the defense was half hearted-loud
threats and protests more than blows-
and the attack swept into the parlor the
thugs hunting and yelling demands for
george steele a tall glass case with
costly bowed front containing the kil-
foyles fine collection of stuffed birds
and realistic wax flowers went over
with a crash like an explosion treas-
ures that did not fall were hurled down
the glass-inclosed ormolu clock was
snatched from the marble mantel and
smashed on the grate and the shining
brass coal scuttle was used to shatter
the huge plate mirror above the mantel

  the women of the house shrieked be-
hind the double doors of the back par-
lor and the thugs turned that way bat-
tering the walnut panels but finding
them stout and firm

  mike and tim fighting now to keep
on their feet and survive broke loose
and made their way to the back parlor


the popular magazine

through the rear hall the panic-
stricken alderman joined them and the
women admitted the three to their ref-
uge through a narrow door which they
hurried to barricade again with furni-
ture

  yere here then-mores th pity
cried mike as he saw george steele
with the women a white-faced bruised
and battered dandy shorn of most of
his finery

  from the other side of the double
doors came the sound of a bulky object
rolling on creaking casters

  faith its noras pianner-theyll
ram the doors with it wailed mrs
kilfoyle

  be ready then maam said mike
tim an mell shoot our way to the
shtairs an yell git to th roof

 yell save mr steele mike
rooney cried the aldermans lady

  george steele wull ye do no bit ter
save yersilf demanded tim lafferty
staring at the dandy with withering con-
tempt yer dead mother was oirish
rest er sowl is ut more dead than
alive ye are on yer feet

 steele staggered forward he
breathed hard and his open eye shifted
about like that of a trapped animal

  the stairs he muttered the
roof thats it-the roof 

  hes hurt mike-dont ye see
pleaded bright-eyed white-faced little
nora have ye no pity mike sure
if yere no friend o mine mike rooney
have ye no duty as an officer o the
law

  mikes wide firm mouth was a hard
straight line his face was gray but his
eyes gleamed like live coals

  if its you thats wantin im saved
nora kilfoyle he exclaimed in a
husky cracked voice

  hes me fathers friend-hes our
friend cried the distracted girl
theyre after im mike-the dead
rabbits you know mike they
havent killed im-but theyll take im

-to five points-th cellars theyll
get money from his friends-an then

theyll kill im slow- oh th black

hearts of them mike

  if its you thats wantin im saved
mike repeated

  mrs kilfoyle hysterical clinging for
support to the arm of a gray-haired
housekeeper who moaned and prayed
uttered a scream as the noise in the
front room grew louder more fearful

 the walnut doors creaked and
groaned they bulged the panels splin-
tered the locks gave way then with a
sickening crash the heavy rosewood
square piano plunged through the bar-
rier propelled by the eager chattering
menacing mob

  its a chase well be havin mike
whispered to nora yell shtay here
-you an yer mother dye hear yell
be safer ill lead em aff

  he caught steele by the collar of his
coat and shoved him roughly through
the little door into the hall the thugs
started forward in pursuit yelling like
beasts those in the rear vaulting over
the piano tim lafferty clubbed them
back threatening them with the revolver
in his left hand

  out to the ruined staircase mike
drove his charge but the mob surged
back through the front parlor to head
him off

  it was a crisis and mike emptied a
revolver into the jam that was made
by the men from the parlor and those
who were pressing into the hall from
the street every bullet found a billet
and there was pandemonium men
shrieked in agony and their comrades
howled for revenge

  bullets thudded into the walls and
stairs and mikes side and leg were
seared by grazing shots but he lifted
and kicked george steele before him
bundled him up the stairs booted and
heaved the almost helpless man as far
as the first landing then he halted and
stopped a gathering charge with six
the peace of hells kitchen



more shots fired from a revolver he
had taken from greaser pete in
schmidts place

 there was still an orange glow over
the sky line of jersey city as mike
paused to take breath on the roof of
the kilfoyle house but the twilight
was deepening the policeman stood
with feet braced apart panting while
he reloaded two empty revolvers gen-
tleman george leaned upon a chimney
his shoulders sagging his head drooping
on his breast but he started and winced
at every wild yell from the rioters in
the street

  tim lafferty joined them there his
right arm hung limp his faithful night-
stick was gone but as he gained the
roof he turned and fired four shots
down the skylight to check pursuers

  m-mygod were not safe-here
mumbled steele theyll be coming
after us

  them words me bucko sneered
lafferty is like enough th first truth
ye ever shpoke intintionally

  come on tim sighed mike wear-
ily a little hopelessly eight avenoos
th best for us if we can make it every
hells kitchen lad must be our frind
this night if we live to need any

  a head bobbed up from the skylight
and mike took a shot at it it dropped
out of sight and no other appeared so
they hurried to leave that roof the
next one to the west was six feet lower
and the two policemen jumped down
and dragged steele after them they
went forward and peered over the cor-
nice and they saw the whole thirty-
third street block between seventh
and eighth avenues crowded with bat-
tling gangmen

  each faction had received reenforce-
ments in mobs of varying numbers ar-
riving by various routes and there had
been no orderly effort to concentrate
either force therefore there were
group battles springing up as forces
collided and dying out or merging with

greater conflicts the initial attempt to
get gentleman george had been the
spark to light the train of powder but
the majority of the combatants hasten-
ing to a rally of the clans fought for the
joy of fighting and did not question the
cause

  no lamplighters had ventured into
the block to light the gas lamps but
rubbish was brought from the houses
and there were two bonfires blazing high
in the middle of the street

  down down tim whispered
mike and shoved steele quickly behind
a skylight bulkhead

  gangsters were pouring out of a
hatchway on the next roof but they
did not seem to be searching for the
fugitives they wrenched the hinged
top off the hatchway carried it to the
front of the roof and heaved it over
down onto the heads of the rioters
below

  hells kitcheners cried tim with
relief and hailed some of the men he
recognized

  theres big babe exclaimed mike
an look-its misthress mullins can
pull down any chimley that a bricklayer
can put up

  the now disheveled and war-scarred
young amazon attacked a chimney with
a short-handled sledge she had brought
from below and the bricks crumbled
and tumbled she bore an armful of
the popular missiles to the edge of the
roof and flung them one by one at care-
fully selected targets bullets began
rising from the street but she gave little
heed to them except to lean less far out
in taking aim

  chimneys began to totter on adjacent
roofs and there were fierce new war
cries of the dead rabbits and their allies
as they felt the force of the west
siders brick barrage

  east siders never submitted tamely
or stupidly to superior tactics of an
enemy and within five minutes bricks
were falling on the heads of the bom-


the popular magazine

bardiers hurled from roofs on the south
side of the street

  on our way tim said mike giv-
ing steele a boost if eight avenoos
clear its on terry-firmy id be shtandin
where a man can walk faster

  they passed through the busy ranks
of the brick grenadiers and crossed
three roofs then as they paused to
negotiate a higher coping tim lafferty
started back and called out a warning

  it was too late dark figures rose
up and fell upon them a thug grap-
pled on to steele and throttled him
mike jammed his revolver into the
mans ribs but a brick glanced off the
side of his helmet and stunned him

  tim was fighting and yelling and
there was a wild and gallant charge over
the roofs by the west siders led by
babe mullins

  a light flared up a feather bed and
a mass of dry rubbish were in flames
on the roof where they fought and
there was no more darkness there

  tim pulled mike out of the melee and
stood him on his feet

  see what yer eyes can see me lad
he whispered begobs were in high
sassiety th duchess is here-the
duchess o mulberry bend

  its erself tim mike agreed in
solemn awe and was revived

  the duchess was giving orders in
phrases rich with blasphemy and ob-
scene invective she was a rawboned
woman easily six feet tall with mascu-
line features and an eye to strike terror
to timid spirits unlike the notorious
babe mullins of the west side who
had an eye and some taste for fashion-
able dress the duchess affected rakish
rough attire she swaggered under a
battered old straw hat ornamented with
a bedraggled ostrich feather her boots
were hobnailed for warfare and her
plaid skirt was short for ease of action
a mans black coat was belted at the
waist and around her neck was knotted
a red bandanna

  the firelight sent little points of
flamelike brilliancy to her finger tips
but the jewels she wore were bright
brass mitts-thimbles joined in sets
which carried sharp spurs in prolonga-
tion of her fingers and served her as
the natural unsheathed claws serve the
jungle tiger

  spotting the babe across the roofs
she yelled an eloquent challenge more
obscene than any of the men were
capable of conceiving and the husky
west side belle took the challenge with-
out wavering

  there was a close-up skirmish now
with interchange of bricks and bullets
and the casualties were piling up but
the two amazons moved upon each
other with no regard for personal safety
they crouched as they came to close
quarters and seemed to spit and yowl
like true feline warriors then the
duchess sprang and gave the plump
vixen the hobnailed boots in the pit of
the stomach

  babe doubled and yelled like a dying
panther but her plump and sinewy arms
went round the others long legs and
held them she sank her strong teeth
in the flesh of the taller womans thigh
and ground them as the bulldog grinds

  the duchess uttered screeches of rage
and agony and squirmed about till she
could jab her ten brass talons into the
neck and shoulder of her opponent

  the exhausted mikes stomach turned
at the sight of blood gushing over the
brass-armored hands of the harpie but
as he turned his head he saw gentleman
george being dragged away senseless
by his assailant it brought him back
to his responsibility and he gripped his
swinging locust stick again and lunged
forward with a wallop that broke the
gangsters head

  there was hotter fighting now back
toward the kilfoyle roof and tim laf-
ferty doing some left-handed sharp-
shooting ripped out a battle cry

   tis the po-lice mike-at last he
the peace of hells kitchen



shouted theres berger an white
an theres a capn from th fourth
ward

  the police were there and their sticks
were cracking crowns but they were
outnumbered a hundredfold it was only
the authority of brass buttons and blue
coats that gave their forlorn comrades
a gleam of confidence

  mike got a grip on the half-dead
steele again and dragged him along the
line of retreat but he turned back to
see how the she-devils fared in their
duel and he saw the bleeding screaming
babe work one of her thick thumbs
into an eye socket of the duchess and
force the eyeball out

  a runt of a man dashed out of the
dead rabbits ranks and aimed a dirk
at the babes back and mike dropped
steele and jerked up his revolver in
time to shoot the brute through the
head it was through no love of his
for babe but she was a west sider
and the time was past for squeamish-
ness

  again he gathered up the battered
gentleman jerking him to his feet

  you he roared in the bruised and
scarred face its all fer you-this
hellish diviltry-ye dhirty louse ye
skunk wid a weasels hearrt

 lemme die moaned george
wretchedly its all over lemme die
rooney

 thin by god ill not yelled mike
in a frenzy yell live if i have ter
kick an beat life into ye th divil
imself would be kickin ye out o hell
this night

  the demoralized steele sank to his
knees whimpering and mike jerked
him up again then the babe herself
swooped upon them caught george in
her bloody arms and flung him across
her lacerated shoulder

  come mike well beat em she
cried i done for the duchess her
eyes out an i bashed her face in for

  her strength and vitality were super-
human she ran like a lumbering cow
but without wavering and she took a
five-foot jump to a lower roof with her
burden on her shoulder

  they were pursued by maddened
dead rabbits and mike walked back-
ward as rear guard shooting and
threatening he got a bullet through
the thick muscle above the knee and
he stumbled and began to hop and limp
but told babe to keep on

  tim lafferty fought his way to them
and the three kept going with tlieir
charge picking out their destination at
the end of the block by the lurid light
that seemed to pervade the whole neigh-
borhood  and they were constantly pro-
tected from the general pursuit that
must mean quick death by the battle
that raged around them

  that section of the city was all illu-
minated now there were bonfires in
the avenues and the streets north and
south and there was the steady omi-
nous hum of wholesale conflict in the
air every vassal clan of the dead
rabbits was represented in the fight
and every slum of the west side from
bowling green to kingsbridge had
yielded its quota of liegemen

  hit it up mike urged the hurry-
ing babe the place-next the corner
-on eight see  theys a fire escape
-to go down

  mike and tim held the desultory pur-
suit in check but their comrades in the
battle were being mauled getting the
worst of it

  mike yelled in horror as he saw a
bulky giant lift sergeant white in his
arms and pitch him over the cornice of
the roof they were crossing then the
mob in the street yelled raucously
ghoulishly-and mike knew that an-
other policemans blue coat would pass
-a priceless trophy-to the sweetheart
of a five points gangster

  he turned with wild eyes to speak to
tim and saw him stretched prone on


the popular magazine

the gravel carpet with a hoarse cry
he leaped to him and turned him over
and found a hole in the middle of his
pals forehead

  oh timmie he cried in grief and
fury

  never yuh mind timmie shouted
babe come on we got to save
ourselves an george

  t hell with george roared mike
an th flames o hell on th head of
im

  yet he went on after hurling lead
from his gun to pay for tims murder
and then he heard a shrill voice behind
him

  git rooney was what he heard
and he whirled to see the ugly face of
jake lozier close to his and caught the
whir of the blackjack as it descended on
the side of his helmet

  he went down blinded paralyzed
but the irish in him stood him on his
feet again he staggered forward
paused to balance himself and strained
his eyes to pierce the fog that had fallen
on them

  his eyes cleared and he saw big babe
go floundering down beneath the smash-
ing blackjack then staring blankly he
made out that the powerful jake took
up the girls burden leaped forward
and went scrambling down the fire
escape for which they had hoped and
struggled

  mike clapped his hand over his swim-
ming eyes and knocked his helmet off
he breathed hard and pulled himself to-
gether

  fer that he cried to the vapors
around him ill save george steele-
save im if tis only fer shpite

  yet he added still dazed  twas
nora wanted im saved-th neefarious
whelp an blayguard

  a strapping swarthy ruffian flashed
past him it was the kanaka sailor
greaser pete and he made for the fire
escape of the eighth avenue building
and followed lozier

  they were the two men mike had
clubbed in the afternoon and vaguely
he began to wonder if he were dead
and meeting his enemies in purgatory

  teetering trying to steady himself
he felt for loose cartridges in his
pocket and when he found some he
awkwardly crammed them into the
empty cylinders of his guns then
stumbling and reeling he made for the
fire escape

  there was black darkness at the bot-
tom of the fire escape and a drop of
six feet into the narrow back yard of
a loft building mike fell into filthy
mud bruising his knees but he scram-
bled up and groped frantically in the
gloom seeking finding nothing

  slipping in soggy rubbish and slime
stumbling over unseen obstructions he
gained the back door of the building and
fell against it blundering down three
slippery steps

  three sharp explosions came from
inside and bullets fanned his face and
sprinkled it with shattered glass

  he shook and kicked the locked door
then held a revolver to the lock and
fired two bullets through it unmindful
of consequences it gave way suddenly
and he pitched into a cellar with a foot
of stagnant stinking water splashing
round his feet

  a flash in the blackness and a bullet
clipped off the top of his left ear he
cursed like a strong man in a fury and
began shooting in the dark swinging
a revolver in each hand

  his fire was returned flashes
blinded him from different points in the
place his foes were moving closing
in on him uttering no sounds closing
in and firing fast with the certainty of
getting him at every beam of fire he
expected a slug in his head or heart but
he went forward walking into the trap
with both guns blazing

  rats squealed and splashed in the
water one hurtled against his leg and
seemed as large as a terrier
the peace of hells kitchen



  hot lead scorched his ribs under the
left arm and he staggered and dropped
on one knee his guns were empty and
he stuffed them into pockets and got
out another one of the captured weap-
ons resuming his fire

  then it seemed that the enemys shots
were coming slower was there but one
man firing a screech followed close
on one of his shots and something
splashed heavily in the filthy mud-laden
water

  mike waited breathless fearfully
hopeful a long silence was broken by
a feeble groan

  george steele is it you he whis-
pered hoarsely

  im dying-drowning moaned the
sufferer

  ye lie-damn yer sowl yelled mike
heartily th likes o you dont die

  he moved splashed forward and
there was no gunfire following the
groans he got to steele and raised him
from a sickening bath of muck and
together they fell over a body lying in
the flood

  god send theres another like that
one muttered mike fervently floun-
dering in slime and dragging steele to-
ward the front of the cellar

  he could hear shooting and yelling in
the streets and suddenly far off
sounded a volley of rifle fire then an-
other and another there was war in
the streets of new york-no mere
shindy for one poor cop to settle with
his nightstick

  he groped and splashed struggled
with the helpless man he held by the
collar and at last found steps leading
out of the water and to a floor above
a little light came in through dirty win-
dows and he made out moving figures
in the avenue and heard sharp clear
voices of authority

  on a hunch his heart swelling with
hope he battered open a door and tum-
bled out into the cool pure air of the
night and he saw men in uniforms

with rifles on their shoulders and knew
that terror had come to an end

  halt who is there cried a sol-
dier darting toward him

  i-i was once a cop please god
said mike brokenly

  neither the commissioner nor your
own mother would know you now but
i can see traces of a uniform get to
your station house officer and go to
sleep three regiments of the national
guard are taking care of the city

  breathing prayers of thanksgiving
mike displayed his burden and a sol-
died helped him to lead and carry the
man up thirty-third street to the kil-
foyles ruined house he would hear
nothing of hospitals for he had to
deliver steele to that house and no-
where else

  the alderman came out a sick man
white and drawn from a night of hor-
ror and mike cast gentleman george
at his feet

  im askin no receipt fer the pack-
age misther kilfoyle he said but
yell please ter say i done me duty-by
th law an fer th sacred bonds o frind-
ship

  there was a little birdlike cry from
inside the door and nora kilfoyle
darted out like a golden-haired sprite
and flung her arms about the neck of
the grimy effigy of mike rooney

  mike mike she cried mike
darlin is it livin ye are my dear oh
micky its a thousand deaths ive died
this night-for love o you an the
black fear in me heart for what id
done twas me own true boy i sent

these hard-worked women

rhen a group of washington society women recently undertook a campaign
to raise funds for a certain charity organization the fact was announced
with the fanfare of trumpets and the booming of big guns which the expert
press agent knows so well how to let loose in this instance the press agent was
a clever woman who proclaimed in impressive headlines that the industrious
social worker in charge of the campaign was a society leader famous in three
world capitals

    then came the press agents tribulation to keep the publicity going she
had to telephone every day to the combination industrious social worker and
society leader to ask for a conference on developments in the whizz-bang
campaign for the big money the third day she put in a call at nine oclock
in the morning whereupon a females voice with a heavy french accent answered
madames never up at this hour i cant disturb her

    the press agent called again at eleven and the same heavy french accent
now tinged with boredom informed her

    madames having her bath i cant disturb her

    a one-oclock inquiry brought the french-accented retort madame is
having lunch i cant disturb her two hours later the voice now emphatically
bored answered madame is devoting her daily hour to writing her memoirs
i cant disturb her and a five-oclock call elicited this response in a tone that
had changed from boredom to something that sounded like downright hostility
madame is playing bridge i cant disturb her

    well for petes sake exploded the -press agent you will disturb her
or ill know the reason why kindly-here the publicists voice indicated a frank
antagonism-kindly say to your disturbed mistress that her disturbed press agent
is raising a disturbance because you have refused all day to disturb her

harry harris had the pret-	excellent in themselves harry got me

on a fighting man everybody	let us look at the facts in the order of

who knows anything about the game	their appearance
knows that he also had an eye for a harry and big duff and i were en-

news story as keen as the eye of a man-	joying our morning work-out with

aging editor with those two qualities	gloves and medicine ball on the roof of

the popular magazine

the hotel stirling twelve stories above
west fifty-sixth street the edge of
the roof was defended by a cute little
brick coping two feet high there was
no peril while we tossed the medicine
ball but if while boxing one of us
happened to back into it or to be
knocked against it over wed go with
nothing but the gentle airs of morning
to prevent quick arrival on the pave-
ment one hundred and fifty feet below

  we had a theory that this danger
would make us most careful with our
footwork it did-although one day a
friend of mine fell with his back against
the little wall after running into a hot
left fist no use going into that let
harry harris speak

  you know bob fitzsimmons and
kid mccoy are going to box at the
milk fund benefit he asked us

  of course we replied ask us a
harder one

  well maybe you dont know i saw
them practice four rounds together yes-
terday afternoon he tantalized us
how would you like to have seen
that

  we both groaned appreciation from
the bottom of our hearts every fight
fan in the world was keen to know
which of these two marvels was the bet-
ter man but each had such deep respect
for the other that he could never quite
make an engagement to box him they
were big middleweights the wily mc-
coy slyest man ever in the ring had
beaten such good men as australian
dan creedon big jim daly and plaacke
the two-hundred-and-thirty-pound cham-
pion of holland and had narrowly
missed knocking out tom sharkey with
his famous corkscrew punch while fitz
had knocked out gus ruhlin the akron
giant the burly sharkey and even the
marvelous corbett master of the manly
art

  how did the two compare harry
we begged to know did the kid jolt
one of those corkscrews against bobs

jaw did fitz coax mccoys guard up
high and crash one on his solar plexus
did-

  oh one at a time harry laughed
the big boys were simply rehearsing
their act for the milk fund show you
dont suppose theyd cut loose with all
they had do you

  well which one made the pace
we asked together

  mccoy of course said harry
fitz always makes the other fellow
lead the kid was away out in front
all the time faster than bob on his feet
but i noticed that he never went close
enough to let bob shift his stand and
let go for his middle whod be ahead
at the finish well you can write your
own ticket but why dont you go down
at three this afternoon and watch them
yourself at jack coopers gym some
story oh boy

  a story id tell the world it was
a reasonably accurate account of how
these famous gladiators shaped up
against each other was front-page stuff
-and then some why that story
would be copied by every newspaper
from nome alaska to cape town and
hakodate it would answer the ques-
tion that eager critics had prayed for
years to see answered and the telling
of it would reflect endless credit on
the world

  it would be not only a beat for our
paper but a beat at the expense of our
strongest rival that was paying thou-
sands of dollars to put on the match
after a hasty shower and the quickest
dressing on record i got the managing
editor on the telephone he caught fire
at the first word

  youre sure you can get in to see
them he asked

   just as sure as im alive i chortled
we cant have a photographer of
course better send up willie wilson
our artist with the camera eye let
him just saunter into jack coopers

him on his life not to recognize me and
not to make one stroke of a pencil
hell get lots of good action stuff and
if he overlooks anything ill give him
the details down at the office

  sounds o k said colonel van
hamm tell young mr harris and
your friend duff to keep mum you
can have all the space you want on the
story ill schedule it for four columns
-have more if you need it good luck
to you

  at luncheon i entertained duff and
harry harris with agreeable tales of
the awful fate that overtook any one
who let an exclusive story leak the
best thing they could do was to dash
into a dark cave somewhere and stay
there till morning they laughed at
first but after a while they began to
see what a tremendously important
thing it was to secure the biggest news
beat of the day and they promised to
be dumb and watch their steps yet
even then i was worried for i knew
that big news was like womans wit as
mr shakespeare described it-close the
door upon it and it would fly out at
the window well all we could do was
to watch and pray

  at a quarter to three i strolled
through west forty-seventh street and
up the stairs into jack coopers gym-
nasium an earnest little group of mid-
dle-aged merchants were toiling with
the medicine ball trying to melt some
of the extra fat off their too prosperous
pink faces and bulging waists two
young actors were boxing in a corner
of the gym but their scowls were fiercer
than their blows near by a heavy
tragedian was pushing up a fifty-pound
bar bell by way of preparing himself
to play spartacus jack cooper him-
self was here and there watching all
the work and giving each pupil a few
words of advice when he needed it

  at five minutes of three a tall pink-
cheeked red-headed man walked into
the gym he had the widest shoulders

in new york and the thickest wads of
muscle under them you can imagine
the knees of his long slender legs ap-
proached each other yet his gait was
brisk in spite of the awkward handi-
cap as he came nearer his blue eyes
lighted up he smiled as an overgrown
boy might smile and thrust out his big-
knuckled right hand covered with
freckles big as ginger-snaps and plen-
tiful as the spots on a thrushs egg

   elio there he greeted me heart-
ily whatre you doing ere

  just looking around i replied
seems like a nice gym might work
here sometime

  aoh yes honest bob responded
suspecting nothing  tis a good gym
nice baths too

  fitz was innocent as a ten-year-old
child about everything outside of the
ropes and posts of the ring in there
facing an antagonist he was as deep
as machiavelli and dangerous as dyna-
mite  but in the outer world he believed
everything he was told and asked few
questions

  presently he came out of the locker
room dressed in a sleeveless white shirt
much cut out at the neck and arms a
pair of old blue trunks short rolled-
down white wool socks and a pair of
soft-soled heelless fighting shoes laced
with white buckskin thongs

  picking up the handles of the near-
est chest-weight machine he began to
raise and lower the iron disks with
broad effortless sweeps of his long and
freckled arms curious thing-you can
tell the professional athlete by the
smooth well-timed movements he
makes so different from the difficult
labor of the amateur

  when fitz turned his back to the ma-
chine and began to shoot out his hands
as if striking blows his fists doubled
he instinctively snugged his chin within
the protection of his massive shoulders
and his eyes peered keenly ahead as if
to watch the movements of an alert


the popular magazine

enemy eternal vigilance is the price of
championship quite as much as it is the
price of liberty it becomes a habit

  after ten minutes of this work fitz
sauntered over to where a brown leather
ball tightly inflated hung from a low
round platform he stepped up to it
carefully measured his distance and
hit it with a swift poke of his left fist
the ball flew as if shot out of a gun
and rebounded as fast but fitzs fist
met it accurately and shot it forward
again then with right and left in turn
he kept it whizzing through the air
faster than eyes could follow the
smacks of the leather against the dry
wood rattling like rapid machine-gun
fire

  i stepped behind him and watched the
play of his fists and shoulders the
muscles of his upper back and chest
were thick as the armor belt of a war-
ship but springy as pure rubber his
shoulders and arms while long were
proportionately thick the whole com-
bination formed the machine he used
to destroy his opponents he had all
the force of a heavyweight carried on
light and spindly legs

  if the legs had been in due propor-
tion to his arms and body he would
have been a giant that queer dispro-
portion made him the oddest freak in
the ring-a middleweight who hit a
more terrible blow than any other man
since sullivan it was overwhelming
crushing to watch that hitting machine
at play

  perched on a stool near the wall was
willie wilson his keen eyes peering
through his glasses fascinated by the
sight of the great puncher at his sport
yet with his clipped formal brown beard
and serious air giving the impression
of a mild theological student who had
wandered in by mistake and could not
find the way out but where was kid
mccoy it was long after three oclock
now and the irresponsible kid neither
appeared nor sent word that he was

coming later we learned that he had
gone out with a friend to try a new car
and forgotten all about his boxing en-
gagement hard luck for my story
but i had no time to mourn

   ere fitzsimmons called to me
letting his arms fall idle im going
to play andball you come on

  but fitz- i began when he

interrupted

  oh you play andball he said i
ear youre good go on in and strip
and urry back i mustnt stop work
and get chilled

  there was nothing else to do so i
came out presently in trunks and soft-
soled shoes and we walked into the
four-walled handball court it was
fifteen feet wide fifteen feet high and
thirty feet deep and the floor was of
hard concrete hard concrete smooth
dark and shiny waiting there to crack
the skull of any poor chump who might
fall on it a chill from that wicked
floor crept up my legs as i marched in
pretending to look gay what was
going to happen flashed through my
mind-fitz had no other partner than
me and after handball he would of
course want to box

  the fearsome thing about boxing with
fitzsimmons was the deadly certainty
with which he was bound to smash you
on the solar plexus this is a ganglion
or nest of nerves in what is called the
pit of the stomach when it is struck
if the abdominal muscles over it are
relaxed the shock paralyzes the victim
from head to foot

  a surgeon operating near it covers
the plexus with a thick mass of cotton
for if he should so much as brush it
ever so lightly with his little finger the
shock will kill the patient even though
he is under the protective influence of
ether i should have been much hap-
pier boxing with fitzsimmons if i
hadnt known about his habit of always
striking this deadly spot i knew too
much about the man
swapping punches with bob fitzsimmons



  when fitz was a tall rawboned lad
of fifteen apprentice to his brother at
the blacksmith trade in the village of
timaru new zealand he competed for
a prize bible offered by the superin-
tendent of the sunday-school to the
pupil who could recite the greatest
number of verses from the new testa-
ment bob had a phenomenal memory
and recited more than one hundred
verses without one fault but the super-
intendent prompted his own son to go
stumbling through an equal number and
gave him the prize bible

  as the boy came smiling down the
aisle fitz cried ere thats mine
grabbed the bible and pushed the boy
away the superintendent powerful
and portly ran to help his son fitz
instinctively swung up his left fist so
that it sank into the portly midriff
just under the loop of the gold watch
chain and the superintendent gasped
and sank like a torpedoed ship bob
fled with his hard-earned bible and
went to that sunday-school no more
though for many months thereafter he
hid in the bush near by with his prayer
book and hymnal and devoutly followed
the sunday services

  that was his discovery of the devas-
tating power of the solar plexus though
he had never heard the name of the
tender spot through all his ring career
he made it his pet and kept it secret
by the old-fashioned method of trial
and error he learned that if his enemy
guessed the blow was coming in time
to fend it off or even to flex the ab-
dominal muscles over the plexus he
could not hurt him but keep him
thinking of guarding his head so that
his front wall was left loose and re-
laxed and the smash on the plexus
ended everything

  and fitz was so ingenious in leading
his victim up to the sacrifice against
peter maher champion of ireland on
the texas border he made a whirl of
passes at the head and in the midst

of them sank his left fist deep in peters
plexus fighting gus ruhlin the ak-
ron giant in madison square garden
he staggered around the ring pretend-
ing to be exhausted by guss punches
and just as the big fellow was gayly
getting ready the finishing wallop-the
torpedo they carried gus to his cor-
ner still helpless after the fatal count
of ten

  fitz put it over with fair words on
tom sharkey at coney island eh
tom he laughed eh tom im
goin to tap your jaw and as simple
tom guarded high fitz slid his right
foot forward and unleashed the fatal
left swing full on the deadly mark

  clever as champion corbett was the
ungainly fitz under heavy punishment
played for his head round after round
charley white and billy delaney
knowing the old fox well begged jim to
keep away

  he hasnt a punch left in him jim
laughed hes tapping my jaw like an
old woman slapping a child hes
through that was exactly the frame
of mind crafty fitz wanted to set up in
corbett-then bang on the plexus

  and this was the magician i must
box i wished myself far far away

  what kind of a head would they put
on the story of my accident would i
rate a spread probably would if the
injuries were serious enough i hoped
jack slaght or elisha kelly would write
it-fellows who knew the game yet
while there was life there was hope
i would be crafty with bob fitzsim-
mons i would go about with him be
cunning let him win the game of hand-
ball soften his hard heart then maybe
he wouldnt do unto me as he had done
to so many others

  charley seymours description came
to mind i dont know how fitz does
it but he fools around and fools around
and all of a sudden-one wallop and
its all off

  that was first-class reporting but it


the popular magazine

had an ugly sound to one who was going
to receive that one wallop so by way
of beginning the heart-softening process
i purposely lost the first hand which
we played for service

  thought you were a good andball
man fitz chuckled as he walked up
to the ace line ready to serve

  every mans good till he meets a
better player i propitiated the red-
headed destroyer moreover while i
made a great fuss in running around to
meet the ball i took pains to lob it up
so that he could get to it and kill it
in that way he scored three aces before
i angled a high dropper in the back
left corner which happened to fall where
casey himself could not have returned
it and so fitzs hand was out

  it was no trick at all to pick up a
couple of aces on my serve for the
great fighter was not a first-class ball
player but i was careful to lose out
after scoring those two points while
fitz served and was rolling up four or
five aces more cruel memory presented
to me a series of moving pictures of
what fitzsimmons had done to friends
of mine who had dared to box with
him

  there was kempster the first ama-
teur he met in america fitz just off
the ship in which he had stoked his
way from australia had permission to
box in the olympic club san fran-
cisco professor watson asked kemp-
ster to give the stranger a little practice
and kemp a tall and excellent amateur
-one of the best in the club-went on
with him he hit the red-headed fellow
wherever he chose not hard but just
enough to show he was there and he
was laughing up his sleeve at the awk-
ward moves of the foreigner when sud-
denly a cannon ball which came from
somewhere he could not see smote
kempster on the solar plexus slammed
him against the wall and sat him on the
floor-out with his eyes open

  whats-that-for he protested

as soon as he could gasp out the ques-
tion

  aoh thats my little joke cried
fitzsimmons laughing heartily as he
lifted up kemp with care congratu-
late me im getting ready to fight
australian billy mccarthy at this club
next week ill it im as sure as i it
you

  and there was the experience of my
friend bob edgren two-hundred-and-
twelve-pound amateur fresh from col-
lege where he had made the hammer-
throwing record for the pacific coast
bob had drawn a lot of fine sketches of
fitz in action-he does fighters better
than any other artist-and he was going
to write a pleasant article to go with his
pictures

   ere now fitz told him i know
youre a great boxer you come on
with me now and you can write that
up too

  honest edgren suspected n harm
so he obliged and when fitz had
neatly dropped bob against the wall he
laughed with all the innocent merriment
of a glad child

 ho ho he chuckled you
ought to see your face when i soaked
you-looked so surprisedlike best joke
i ever saw ho ho

  and this was the genial joker i knew
was going to lead me to the slaughter
not that a knock-out more or less would
amount to so much-but oh my head
crashing that flinty concrete floor as
these pleasant thoughts flitted through
my mind i must have forgotten about
my plan to lose our game of handball
for i was roused from my painful day-
dreams of destruction by hearing fitz-
simmons exclaim twenty-one to
twenty no arm done ill beat you
next time

  thanks for a nice game i ex-
claimed impulsively shaking hands and
at the same moment skipping away
im for the showers as fast as i can

go-
swapping punches with bob fitzsimmons



  aoh no youre not fitz insisted
youre going to box with me
nonsense i laughed at him i
might hurt your hands on my head
nonsense nothing he replied
youre elected put on the gloves
mechanically i picked them up and
slipped my hands into them there
was no hope of escape at such a mo-
ment the senses are unusually acute i
noticed that there was not a mark on
my gloves while the gloves on fitz-
simmonss hands were smeared with
blotches of dark rusty red that was
it his were the gory gloves of the exe-
cutioner mine the unstained gloves of
the victim

  i had need of all the wise counsel
mike used to give us in the club box-
ing room especially of this choice bit
when youre going to box a fellow
act gallus whether you feel gallus or
not in other words make the an-
tagonist think you are gay as a lark
even though you feel like a lump of

lead therefore-

  keep your solar plexus well cov-
ered now i warned fitz i dont

want to take advantage-

  if you can it me there ill give you
a box of cigars he said very seriously
he could not see anything to joke about
in a reflection on his skill in self-de-
fense his art was as sacred to him as
music is sacred to paderewski or money
to mr morgan

  of course im not going to urt you
if thats what youre thinking about
he added with uncanny instinct reading
my mind i was astonished that he
could tell what i was thinking about-
that is i was astonished until i remem-
bered he was in the ring now and once
in the ring this boyish-minded man be-
came a master of tact cunning mind-
reading and influencing there was
something hypnotic about him

  we shook hands stepped aside and
backward and stood on guard fitzs
arms swayed before him loose as the

limbs of a weeping willow the snaky
muscles rippling and the ginger-snap
freckles dancing his mouth was set in
a grim line that indicated determina-
tion but there was a mischievous smile
in his blue eyes that warned me to be-
ware of some practical joke he was
hatching how small his head looked
with its bald top and red side thatch set
low between his gigantic shoulders

  i noticed that his neck which had
always seemed rather thin spread wide
at the base and was really unusually
thick and strong his waist and hips
were lacking-no more hips than a tea-
cup as charley white said his ridic-
ulous grapevine legs it appeared could
hardly bear the weight of his great body
as he sprawled forward with shuffling
steps as uncouth a figure as the straw
woodman in the wizard of oz

  yet with a kind of awkward clever-
ness fitz managed to be well within
hitting range whenever he wished to
be everybody that ever fought fitz-
simmons had hit him and even this
amateur in a friendly practice bout-
so called-was no exception to the rule
i stepped in quickly shot a straight left
to the jaw and was just about to step
aside when bang came his right fist
in a counter blow fair on my short ribs

  his fist had not moved six inches
but i could feel the floating ribs buckle
in under its weight i had a sharp
stitch in my side and it was hard
to catch breath i gasped skipped out
of distance and sparred from afar
the only safe place from which to shoot
at fitz was the other side of a ten-
acre lot

  at first i had thought him easy but
there was his ready counter blow wait-
ing to catch me as i came in against
it thus doubling its force this man
was no tom sharkey hurling a flock of
random punches in the hope theyd land
somewhere this man was a sharp-
shooter who never fired except when
he had a clear certainty of his mark


the popular magazine

  i circled about the court now darting
in toward fitz now rapidly side-step-
ping as soon as i had let go a jab at
his head or his ribs twice i shot for
the solar plexus-that tract shaped like
a capital a which lies just below the
heart and above the stomach-but all
i hit was fitzs stout arm guarding it
his plexus and his box of cigars were
quite safe no matter what i tried he
seemed to have thought of it one-tenth
of a second before and spoiled it for
me it looked as if he had silently
willed me to do just as he wished after
some four or five minutes of this he
called time and we rested together in a
corner

  youre a real fine hypnotist fitz
i complimented him

  oo-me he snorted indignantly
im no ypnotist

  oh yes you are i assured him
you wish me to hit a certain blow so
that you can block and counter it force
me to leave an opening so you can crack

  aoh that aint ypnotism fitz ex-
claimed thats soience

  no use trying to explain to him that
his science was really applied hyp-
notism especially when he was so
touchy about iwind had his two fists
with him and lurking always in the
back of his mind was that little joke
he was bound to put over when it would
come as a complete surprise and there
was the cold hard concrete floor wait-
ing

  come on now he called stepping
out to the center weve got to tend to
business

  and once more i followed him
throwing an occasional left at his iron
jaw and rarely very rarely following
with a right on the other side this
happened twice and the ease with which
i did it made me wary he was lead-
ing me into a trap

  every one who boxed fitz hit him
began to feel gay about it and then-

the torpedo went off i watched with
redoubled anxiety as we drew nearer
to each other i saw his blue eyes turn
to the color of ice and his right foot
creep forward as his left fist drew back
instantly i was away on the other side
of the handball court poised for a step
to either side

   ere he cried where are you
going

  im going far and im going sud-
denly to a good safe place fitz i
replied with a grin i saw you look
at jim corbett like that at carson city
just before you outed him and im
going while the goings good

  aoh no he said sadly im not
goin to urt you come on now

  but though i came on and sparred
i refused to let myself be lulled into
false security perhaps the old fox
did not know that his eyes betrayed his
purpose whenever he began to calculate
the chances of slipping home his favor-
ite knock-out blow but i never lost
sight of them and when that icy gleam
appeared i fled he thought it was
funny and haw-hawed heartily as i
skipped away and after enjoying the
comedy long enough he called time on
this second round of four minutes

  i was glad to rest for breathing was
becoming difficult and the usually strong
legs were getting a trifle wabbly it
was not the physical exertion that tired
me for i thought nothing of boxing
thirty or forty minutes every day with
big duff who outweighed fitz by
twenty-five pounds it was the mental
and nervous strain of trying to keep up
with a champion

  i was like the expert english golfer
who explained the other day why he
did so poorly against bobby jones by
saying he was so sure of himself
and played every shot so perfectly that
i was completely dithered and i was
so dithered that fitz let me rest two full
minutes before he called time and
wind-up
swapping punches with bob fitzsimmons



  the machiavelli of the ring was so
intent on his joke now that the malicious
gleam of his eyes lit up the handball
court like a searchlight i continued to
go through the motions of boxing with
him but that was about all i did when-
ever his right foot began to creep for-
ward i jumped in and clinched so that
he could not complete his famous shift
and rip up the fatal left hook on the
plexus fitz knew why i did this and
he laughed and laughed while i hung
on for life

  aoh he yelled hes bitin me
mister referee drag im off wont
you 

  wed break the clinch spar again
and repeat the performance as he made
ready to shift and shoot the k o
perhaps he knew how worried i was
and really got more fun out of torturing
me by anticipation than he would have
got from letting go the awful punch
of course i could have stopped the bout
at any moment and politely asked him
not to put me out but that sort of thing
is simply not done in our best pugilistic
circles it hurts less to go out than to
beg off at all events when i was
ready to drop from exhaustion fitz
yelled time shook hands with me
and laughed for a full minute

  i have never flattered myself that i

escaped through skill or agility or any
effort of my own for between the man
who fights for a living and the amateur
who spends his time and money on the
game for fun and health there is a dif-
ference as wide and deep as the sea

  do you doubt it see what is going
on all around us every year several
football stars encouraged by the praise
of friends who are carried away by par-
tisan spirit try their fortunes in the
ring intending to become champions
and live happy forever after

  few of them last long enough to be-
come fair second-raters no the ama-
teur may be a good lad often is but

over the border
touring conditions in old mexico

  dear mr worth reading the statistics
the other day on the export of automobiles
to mexico ive begun to wonder what they
do with them all unless there are some good
roads an auto has to run on a road and
if mexico has no good roads there cant be
any use for autos can there conclusion
new places and new friends



mexico must have some good roads and
if this is the case why not step on the self-
starter and do a little touring in a new envi-
ronment 

   i have toured all over these united states
and canada and am looking for new worlds
to conquer my car isnt amphibian so the
atlantic and pacific stopped me can i
turn my balloon tires toward the rio grande
and find roads across it any information
which you can give me will be greatly appre-
ciated robert m fort worth texas

  the mexican government has given
its attention recently to roads in conse-
quence of the apparent value of the
auto a comprehensive program of
road building has been undertaken it
comprises  miles of main high-
ways and  miles of branch lines
and calls for an expenditure of nearly
 in six years

  we would advise robert m to avoid
tropical mexico during the period from
may through october this is the
rainy season and although the rain in
mexico isnt salt he would find some of
the same kind of trouble which he com-
plains of in regard to our eastern and
western oceans

  one of our enthusiastic correspond-
ents who lives in cuidad de valles in
plain american city of valleys writes
us that the national highway south from
laredo on the texas border has reached
his town valles is in the southeast
part of the province of san luis potosi
well down in the tropics that is

  he says this road is now in use ex-
cept in the rainy season and that many
tourists have come part way several
as far south as valles it is a three-day
drive south of -the united states border

  his description is alluring enough
but as we dont want to have the lives
of any of our readers on our conscience
we will condense what he says and you
can write to him for further informa-
tion 

  as the highway is built other improve-
ments are made the land is cleared of
brush and trees then fenced and crops grown

magnificent views are opened up of moun-
tains valley and plain fruits and flowers
galore abound nearly all the year just now
the ca-ca-la-su-chil has its fragrant white-
and-pink blossoms and the scarlet buginvil-
laea looks at a distance like an immense bou-
quet

  the views alone in this part of mexico
will bring hundreds of tourists this fall and
winter provision is now being made to
care for them hotels restaurants tourist
camps there are hunting fishing and swim-
ming all winter long

  i pioneered in california many years ago
and the same opportunities are here in this
part of merico hydroelectric power can
be developed land irrigated oil wells driven
furniture produced from native trees sugar
cane grown-and for the highbrows archae-
ological research and tropical botany mex-
ico is a wonderful country and regardless
of what you expect here you will be sur-
prised

  we have had little news from those
who have actually had personal expe-
rience touring in mexico and would
welcome letters from any such if
robert m or any of our readers
wishes to write this correspondent he
may do so inclosing five one-cent

big-game hunting

in the colorado rockies

  dear mr worth  once every year i
get out the trusty old shooting irons and
trek out to the wilderness for some real
sport this fall im planning a big-game
hunting trip in the colorado rockies as
ive been informed that this part of the
world offers many inducements to the disci-
ple of the gun can you tell me what wild
animals are found in colorado and which
of these are not protected under the game
laws of the state in what districts are
these found

  what sort of an outfit is needed by one
hunting big game and should it be bought
before going to colorado what time of
the year is best for big game what is the
cost of a hunting license where is such
a license obtained is it necessary to go
away from the railroad and get into the


the popular magazine

wilds in order to hunt big game i seem
to be asking a lot of questions but will be
most grateful for this information

bill d kansas city missouri

  bill has picked a splendid state for
his fall expedition for bears deer elk
mountain sheep antelope beavers buf-
falo mountain lions lynx foxes bob-
cats coyotes and wolves are all found
in the colorado rockies of these
bears lions lynx foxes coyotes and
wolves are not protected under the game
laws of the state

  these animals are found in the re-
mote mountain districts far from civili-
zation especially in middle park south
park north park the gunnison coun-
try and the southwestern part of the
state

  for big-game hunting a man wants
regular outing clothes heavy underwear
laced mountain boots standard big-
game rifle and small pistol he will
also need dogs horses and a complete
camp outfit including sleeping bags in
some instances it is wise to procure the
services of a guide who will furnish
the horses dogs and camp outfit it
will not be necessary for bill to pur-
chase his outfit before going west for
denver stores carry a complete line
in fact guns clothing and mountain
boots can be bought to better advan-
tage there than elsewhere

  the best time for hunting bear is
from may th to june th and from
september th to october th for
mountain lions and bobcats the season
starts january th and ends march
th snowshoes are required for trips
at this time

  a nonresident big-game license costs
twenty-five dollars a year it may be
obtained at any county clerks office
in the state at the game wardens office
capitol building denver and at all
sporting-goods dealers in denver

  bill will find it absolutely necessary
to go away from the railroads and out
into the wilds in order to hunt big game

there is no game close to the towns or
settlements

  and now before we dismiss this sub-
ject of hunting we have a word to say
to the wives of our sportsmen while
your husbands are away on their annual
hunting trips wouldnt you like to do a
little corresponding with the wives of
other hunters

  mrs d c b of nevis minnesota
tells us that she would welcome letters
her husband isa trapper and real
woodsman and she is accustomed to the
yowl of the coyote

  mrs william r alturas california
isv another trappers wife who would
like correspondents

  letters sent to these two hunters
wives in care of this department will
be forwarded promptly

around the seven seas
correspondents from ireland to cathay

  dear mr worth  i notice that you offer
to give information about places near and
far and the routes that take one around
the world and back now id like nothing
better than to travel and see strange lands
but unfortunately im an invalid and can
only take trips in my imagination or by
reading about the experiences of others

  im wondering however if you couldnt
put me in touch with some of populars
readers who live in other countries per-
haps some of them would not mind exchang-
ing letters with a stay-at-home it would
certainly mean a great deal to me for it
would bring the spice of adventure into my
quiet and secluded life

carl r boston massachusetts

  indeed we can give carl r some
addresses of people who live in far-
away places who will be glad to cor-
respond with him the desire to re-
ceive letters is universal whether a man
lives in india africa or australia

  if carl r is interested in central
america don jose b of honduras
can give him a great deal of informa-
tion about that part of the world
new places and new friends



  w g c fort delhi india can tell
him about life in the far east

  t collins deepcut camp hants
england has something to say about
the british empire while russel c of
victoria australia can satisfy carl rs
curiosity about that commonwealth

  hawaii is always a fascinating place
to read about and w neil d schofield
barracks honolulu is a willing author

  for color and romance china is hard
to beat and so wed advise carl r to
inscribe a letter at once to private h
g united states marines shanghai
china

  and if he has any questions to ask
about the emerald isle hed better get
in touch by letter with gunner jack e
fort dunree londenderry north ire-
land

  we think that will do for a start
no doubt there are other readers who
feel as carl r does about the lure of
far places if so wed advise them to
fill up their fountain pens and get busy
letters to any of the above correspond-
ents sent in care of this department
will be forwarded

forest ranger
and how one qualifies for the position

  dear mr worth  im an honest-to-good-
ness outdoor man and am tired of working in
the city a job as ranger in one of uncle
sams national forests would hit me just about
right and im wondering whether you can
tell me how one goes about getting such a
position

  what age men are eligible what edu-
cation is necessary what is the salary of a
ranger does he have to furnish his own
saddle horses is it necessary to pass an ex-
amination to qualify for a ranger job as
you can see from this array of queries id
like all the facts you can give me and id
surely appreciate it very much if you could
put me in touch with a forest ranger now in
the service	roger f

  akron ohio

  to be eligible for appointment as a
forest ranger the applicant must be

certified by the civil service commis-
sion after passing a competitive ex-
amination such examinations are held
only in the states in which there are
national forests as under the law the
forest ranger position must be filled
whenever practicable by selection from
qualified citizens of the state in which
the work lies

  the ranger examination which is
held in october is thoroughly practical
and requires field training and experi-
ence together with some knowledge of
the rudiments of forestry only able-
bodied male citizens of the united
states between the ages of twenty and
thirty-five years of age are admitted to
the examination these age limits do
not apply however to men having pref-
erence because of military or naval serv-
ice 

  while the equivalent of graduation
from a four-year high-school course is
ordinarily necessary if a man is to at-
tain a passing mark in the educational
and mental tests given in the ranger
examination the required knowledge
which a man must have to answer the
practical questions in the examination
comes mostly from actual experience in
the woods and on the range

  the salaries now paid in the ranger
position are one thousand six hundred
and twenty dollars per year for assistant
rangers and from one thousand eight
hundred dollars to two thousand dollars
for rangers in responsible charge of
ranger districts according to the vol-
ume of business and other things in-
volving the many difficulties of adminis-
tration

  we can understand roger fs desire
to correspond with a forest ranger and
are glad that we have the name and ad-
dress of one to pass on to him if he
will write to f x d peola washing-
ton well forward his letter this is
a good chance for other readers who are
interested in forest ranger service to
get firsthand facts

a vital one through the media of weekly story papers maga-
zines and books we afforded mental relaxation entertainment and
a love for reading that could not be supplied by anything else
