chapter i
the anger of tros
there was no disguising the tri-
remes injuries nor her command-
ers discontent tros had buried
his dead in cyprus in a cave near sala-
mis they had been so many that the
lower oar-bank could no longer be
manned there were smashed bulwarks
hastily repaired but unpainted there
were scars where the enemy ships had
grappled and ground the triremes flanks
like killer-sharks fast to a whale in a
storm that rolled them gunwales-under
  the purple sails bent on for effect-
there was no wind-emphasized the
battle-havoc the victorious trireme ap-
peared to be limping home from igno-
minious defeat-an unfortunate impres-
sion to create in alexandria the alex-
andrines loved successful people and
proofs of success
  tros glowered as he paced his quarter-
deck and studied the magnificent har-
bor-front it was as busy as ever one
might imagine there were no such people
as romans at civil war with one an-
other for the right to plunder the whole
known world ahiram second-in-com-
mand in tros third-best cloak said
something about the splendor of the
marble buildings in the morning sun
he came of a silent race and it was not
often that he volunteered remarks about
anything except the management of the
ship but the strain of his captains
silence had become too much even for
his taciturn disposition tros stared at
him a moment gave an order to the
helmsman and then answered with cold
a novelette by talbot mundy
passionate anger that made the phoe-
nician flinch
  aye a fine may morning counting
wounded who are fit to die we have lost
one hundred and eleven men and to
what good purpose
  ahiram sniffed the off-shore zephyr
that bore the mingled smell of flowers
spices vegetables animals and men it
was good in his salty nostrils he re-
torted
  youve your cabin stuffed with
chests of gold enough to buy one of yon
palaces if t were you id buy a palace
instead of wanting to sail around the
world maybe the world isnt round
you only think it is you dont know
and the sea is a hard life courtiers have
it easy three special cooks to stew a
sows teats for your breakfast and a
brace of wenches to relacquer your toe-
  nails every time you kick a blackamoor
  for being late with the wine
    it was nothing new that the phoeni-
  cians thoughts should run in that vein
  after a month at sea but the helms-
  mans thoughts also were home-coming
  seamanly eager tros rebuked him
  eyes on the course you argive
  satyr
    every man who could find an excuse
  to be on deck or who could escape a
  decurions vigilance was leaning over-
  side to stare at the rhakotis wharf
  where the bawds were waiting gay in all
  the colors of the rainbow defeat or vic-
  tory were all one to those parasites so
  be the crew had money
ahiram thinking of shore-leave tried
to change his commanders humor tros
was quite capable of withholding the
crews wages and ahirams too for the


adventure
sake of wharf-side morality dreadful
thought
  and the queen she would be feel-
ing good said ahiram
  she has seen our sails since day-
break tros answered she rises early
-stands naked facing east at sunrise
by pigeon post from salamis to tyre
and thence by runner she will have had
secret information of our victory at sea
-aye and of more besides
  she should be pleased said ahiram
her own fleet had deserted to the
romans weve saved salamis from the
pirates weve outsmarted the romans
weve sold the egyptian corn and got
paid for it weve established queen
cleopatras sister as safe as a peg in a
hole on the throne of cyprus the queen
has had plenty of time to hear all about
it shell be pleased to see us-aye and
generous
  tros stared it amazed him that a
man could be so simple-minded does
your sidonian intellect perceive the evi-
dences of her pleasure where are the
garlanded boats to bring us greeting
not even a signal from the pharos not
even the hog-eyed harbor-master in his
galley not even esias boat phagh
she has probably warned jew-esias i
am out of favor the more you do for
kings and queens the less they trust
you and the more they want
  but youre no easy one yourself lord
captain said ahiram true you pay
well and youre a man of your word
but the price a man pays for serving
you well is to be given an even harder
task
  hard over ease your sheets now
ahiram there might come a flurry of
wind down haul and stow sails cym-
bals starboard half-ahead port side
half-astem easy all starboard half-
ahead easy
  tros guided the trireme to the clash
of the signaling cymbals and with ges-
tures to the helmsman through the nar-
row entrance of the inner harbor of rha-
kotis where there were docks and re-
pair-yards hemmed in by offices lum-
ber-yards storage-sheds and taverns in
a spider-web maze of irregular streets
  he was going to have to haul out and
no bones about it the trireme leaked
she had been damaged under-water by
the headlong full sail impact against
pirates hulls esias largest hauling-out
dock was vacant so he put a crew
ashore to warp the ship into it with
jack-of-all-jobs conops and the ten-jew
bodyguard to beat the women back and
give the crew a chance to handle the
lines there were fifty strumpets scream-
ing with laughter and feigning baccha-
nalian frenzy and another hundred
swarming across the roof of esias office
while their owners watched them through
the barred gate
  no sign of the one man in alexandria
on whom tros felt he could rely the
temple gongs were clanging for some fes-
tival or other but that was no reason
why esias should be conspicuously ab-
sent jews didnt recognize pagan festi-
vals if they could help it but there was
not even one of esias partners on the
wharf to do the honors and to give the
last breathless news of what had hap-
pened while tros was at sea out of touch
with events
  it was impossible to keep the crew any
longer aboard from cyprus by way of
tarsus to alexandria had been a toil-
some voyage against a head wind short
of provisions and water tros had an
unfashionable objection to cutting the
throats of wounded men so one of
esias sheds would have to be turned
into a hospital and the osirian priests
who were pretty good doctors would
have to be sent for and suitably per-
suaded with gifts of young black bulls
and money the triremes doctor as-
sisted by the bards had done his best
but he was overworked and short of
bandages
  the moment the oars were all stowed
in the overhead racks the rowers
cleopatras promise

swarmed on deck each man with his
little bag of personal possessions the
women began to swarm aboard and
there was no stopping them until tros
made it known that there would be no
pay for the crew until the trireme had
been hauled out and stripped ready for
esias shipwrights
  ahead leading between city slums
there was a ramp made of balks of tim-
ber with enormous capstans at the up-
per end there were cranes sheer-legs
workshops everything for repairing
building or rebuilding four ships at a
time but all the gear would have to go
ashore before repairs could commence
the women began to lose enthusiasm
the crew clamored to be put to work
and get it done with
 tros went ashore he strode into
esias gloomy office with the air of a
man looking for trouble as if more of
it might help him to conquer what he
had already there were plenty of slaves
at the long drafting tables plenty of
clerks to bow and be obsequious but no
esias and not even a partner there
was an atmosphere of unspoken unwel-
come if not ill will slaves taking their
cue from displeased masters however
a slave in a brown smock walking back-
ward opened a door and admitted tros
into an inner office shutting the door be-
hind him with a peculiar stealthy move-
ment that suggested a trap
        hillel the man whom tros
gpsj least liked of esias five part-
ners sat staring across a table
that was piled with scrolls he
was a middle-aged man with a keen face
and a pronounced stoop from the shoul-
ders whose hands clutched invisible
things with nervous indecision
  lord captain tros he said with-
out rising you were better at sea you
have brought your ship into a harbor
full of intrigues of which no man can
foresee the outcome
  where is my friend esias
  he was summoned to the palace as
soon as your ship was sighted there is
no word from him since i think the
queen suspects him of intriguing with
you lord captain-if he is in the
dungeon-being tortured-as his friend
are you not willing to spare his old bones
by making haste to tell the queen your
secrets he wont tell them he will
never tell without your permission
you are inventing alarms tros an-
swered
  am i it is said that you sold the
corn fleet to the romans
  i did i have the money
  lord tros there is a plot that has
been discovered they are taking many
important people to the dungeons it
is being said you have conspired with
the romans to overthrow queen cleo-
patra and to put her sister arsinoe of
cyprus on the throne in her stead have
you her with you on the trireme
  tros laughed angrily am i a mad-
man arsinoe is in cyprus the money
for esias corn is in my cabin send your
slaves to carry it here and get it count-
ed give me a receipt and credit me with
my fifth of it all get the pay-roll from
my clerk pay the crew half their wages
after they have hauled out has esias
sold my pearls
  he sold them to the queen
  for a fair price
  an incredible price but let him tell
you if they havent flayed him to death
the queen has the pearls we have the
money but where is esias
  i will see the queen and ask her
lord tros you were better at sea
you were better at sea the queen may
order your arrest she is afraid she is
a ptolemy a fearful ptolemy is a dead-
lier menace to her friends than a poison-
ous serpent she suspects every one
of what
  of conspiring to kill her and put her
sister arsinoe on the throne there is a
rumor that arsinoe is on her way to
egypt it is said that the roman pro-

adventure
consul cassius is sending an army to her
aid from syria it is being said that you
plotted it and that esias knows it is
said it was you who persuaded the egyp-
tian war fleet to desert to cassius that
there might be no fleet in alexandria
to resist invasion and esias-
  is not a fool such as you are hillel
neither is the queen such a fool that she
would risk the enmity of all the jews in
alexandria by torturing esias-nor such
a fool as to believe arsinoe could land
in egypt in advance of a roman army
and escape death you are full of ru-
mors and they belly-ache you hillel
i go to the palace order me a litter and
summon the master-shipwrights have
them grease the ways thoroughly before
they haul out can you rid the wharf of
those wenches
  lord captain tros at least a third
of them are spies expressly sent to learn
from your men what you were doing
 cyprus in tarsus and elsewhere i
i dered the wharf-gate locked they
t-ame over the roof i ordered them
driven away and i received a warning
from no other than the personal slave of
the chief of police not to interfere with
the rights of their masters guild
clear me a shed for a hospital
lord tros send your wounded to a
temple
  nay let them lie in comfort
  as for the trireme frankly i would
not dare to-
  tros interrupted this hillel is a
i-t of the repairs that i know need do-
ing check that and write me an esti-
mate but as for what needs doing be-
low water we shall know when she is
hiuled out so summon the shipwrights
lord tros-
i believe you heard me hillel at-
tend to it order a litter-a good one
hillel shrugged his shoulders and sent
a slave for a hired litter tros overheard
the command
  i will ride in a private litter he re-
marked casually as if he were ordering
the next course of a meal but his leonine
eyes looked dangerous and hillel noticed
it he explained
  lord captain tros you are out of
favor who is there who would dare
to lend his private litter in such times
as these when no one knows who is to
be accused next who shall lend his litter
and liveried bearers to a man denounced
as a pirate
  who denounced me
  one of the queens miuister
  tros threw back his shoulders he
astonished even hillel who knew bet-
ter than to expect mild measures from
the man whom cleopatra had employed
to do what not one of her own com-
manders could have been trusted or
would have dared to attempt
  send your best dressed slave to the
palace to say that lord captain tros
awaits a litter to convey him to au audi-
ence with the queen
  lord captain what if she sends a
guard instead to take you to the dun-
geon
  tros snorted she is not a coward
she is not a reptile nor a born fool
she and i have been friends too many
years for her to put me to that indig-
nity on the strength of a mere rumor
lord tros dozens of her friends are
in the dungeons
  send for the royal litter
  he strode out of the office and watched
esias slaves remove the treasure from
the cabin-watched the wounded being
laid on the wharf in a dismal row-
watched the grease being laid on the
ramp-ordered all the gear and even
the arrow-engines unshipped-foresaw
and attended to a hundred details-un-
til at last to the confusion of hillel
a litter did come from the palace borne
by eight men in queen cleopatras liv-
ery and preceded by a eunuch who was
insolent and elegant enough to be the
queens own usher
  there was no bodyguard provided
that was the only suggestion that tros
cleopatras promise

might be in disfavor but he was in no
mood to go unsuitably attended he
summoned his ten jews ex-gladiators
they looked splendid enough in their
polished armor to be any ones escort
but conops with his one eye and his
slit lip in a kilt and a tasseled red cap
looked not so praiseworthy neverthe-
less it did not occur to tros to enter
upon deadly danger without conops at
his heels
  tidy yourself you filthy dock-rat
wheres your armor stick that knife
inside your shirt and gird a sword on
try to look less like an ape that fell
into a sewer shall i go through the
streets of alexandria ashamed of the
commander of my escort spruce your-
self
  aye aye master
 and remember not to touch your
forelock to the queens guards be in-
solent
  aye aye
  lord tros said hillel armed
slaves armed slaves in the city it is
known that those men are slaves and
that esias gave them to you
  i know the law tros answered
so do the royal guards said hillel
those arrogant dogs-
  shall bite a bad bone be assured of
it hillel
  conops changing even his normal
habits with his masters mood bethought
him of dignity and sent one of the jews
to bring his armor he made another
jew spit-and-polish an imagined rust-
spot even the armor could not make
him look less bow-legged nor give him
height but he looked at least business-
like in the gleaming crestless helmet
and there was no doubt at all of his
grip on his ten men
  fall in you sons of abraham five
of you to each side of the litter now
then pick your heels up march like
gladiators clank like one man
  ready master lord captains es-
cort by the centre forward quick
march left left left youre out
of step josephus-do you think its a
dance youre doing for the dock-side
wenches left left
  the dock gate opened wide and tros
went forth to he knew not and conops
cared not what fate
chapter ii
give these men their freedom
the eunuch got lost in the
crowd he was so full of his
own importance that he
walked straight ahead with his
nose in the air and when a polyglot
swarm of loafers rushed from watching
some street-corner acrobats to the more
exciting spectacle of a tavern fight be-
tween greeks and gabinian ex-soldiers
some of them still in the rags of roman
uniform the eunuch remained ignorant
for several minutes that he was no long-
er being followed by his cortege
  tros had whispered to conops and
conops rose to the occasion the litter-
bearers protested but the ten jews prod-
ded them as if they were asses and in
a moment the litter was going at a dog-
trot up a side street taking a devious
but comparatively unobstructed course
toward the splendid municipal building
-not however toward the front en-
trance whose marble steps were packed
with people waiting to see a religious
procession
  being a festival day the courts and
the principal municipal offices were
closed the whole long marble-fronted
colonnaded street of canopus was a
mass of spectators in holiday miood
through which the chariots of exquisites
were being driven headlong by chario-
teers who enjoyed being cursed and
whose owners could afford to be fined if
the police could get near enough to take
their names
  it was a dinning ululating pulsing
city full of street fights and laughter and

adventure
flowers with the wealth all in view and
the poverty kept where it belonged out
of sight in the meaner by-ways noth-
ing-absolutely nothing was allowed to
interfere with alexandrine gaiety even
business-and it cost money to be gay
and splendid-ceased while the alexan-
drines played
  but from sunrise to sunset three hun-
dred and sixty-five days in a year one
could pay taxes so there was one office
entered from the rear of the municipal
building whose doors never closed dur-
ing daylight hours
 two or three hundred yards away
from the door of that office conops
collected the jews swords and piled
them beside tros in the litter he even
piled their helmets in the litter to com-
plete their air of innocence
  in armor without helmets or weap-
ons they looked ridiculous they were
jeered by the crowd but they reached
the office door without having to use
their fists on any one except the litter-
bearers who felt like lost sheep without
their eunuch and suspected too that
they were being put to unlawful purpose
and would be whipped when the eunuch
found them
  tros led the ten jews into the office
and lined them up in front of a long
counter at which sat seven of the most
efficient bureaucrats on earth-three to
watch the three who did the business
and one to make sure that the watchers
themselves did no thieving
  there was  astonishment no com-
ment no expression of special interest
it was quite usual for alexandrines to
select festival days for rewarding faith-
ful slaves tros was abrupt and busi-
nesslike
  give these ten men their freedom
here are the certificates of ownership
here are the receipts for the tax on pre-
vious transfer showing the value at
which they were then assessed
  ten per cent again said an official
this is taxed as a transfer of owner-
ship to the slave himself
  tros paid it wincing the officials
signed and countersigned ten certificates
on parchment there was a charge for
the parchment the chief official sealed
the ten certificates there was a charge
for the seal a corresponding entry was
made on the archive-scroll there was
a charge for the entry then each jew
received his utterly unexpected certifi-
cate of freedom tros cut short their
jubilation
  fall in stand at attention have
i loosed a lot of sentimentalists if i
buy garlic do i kiss the seller you have
paid for your freedom-earned it like
men in battle now earn friendship
by obedience as freedmen rather than
as slaves who must obey or be whipped
form two deep right forward by the
right quick march
  outside conops returned their weap-
ons he observed their faces he de-
tected symptoms
  sulphury cocytus up-snoots is it
proud and lofty which of you wants
to fight me for who buys wine which
two of you no takers swallow this
then what a slave does well a freedman
does exactly twice as well or he hears
from me about it with the butt-end of a
crank-bar stand dignified-this isnt
yom kippur or the feast of esther
by the right-dress cock your helmet
straight you and for the love of your
mother jezebel try to march as if you
never wore leg-irons
  he was talking for time and to dis-
tract attention there was something
going on that tros might not wish to
be noticed by his escort a slave had
slipped a note into tros hand just as
he was getting into the litter a very
well-dressed alexandrine in a two-horsed
chariot at a street corner not far away
was watching expecting a signal from
tros or an answer by the slave and
tros appeared to be considering what
to do or to say
cleopatras promise

  then at last the queens eunuch came
sweating and very indignant he had
evidently been mocked and not too gent-
ly handled by the crowd as he traced
the litter through the swarming streets
he tried to reach tros to give him a
piece of his mind but conops interfered
blocking his way
  hold hard capon youll be spitted
soon enough without crowding your bet-
ters whats the excuse you have to
offer what dye mean by sneaking off
and leaving the lord captain in the
streets without a peacock to show his
importance betting on tomorrows
races were you
  the eunuch was half-hysterical with
anger he minced thin-lipped profan-
ity
  sailor alexandria knew no worse
epithet this is a royal litter the
queens
  can the queen go where she pleases
  certainly
  well heres her litter where its rider
pleases
  drunkard i have orders to convey
your master to the palace
 then why didnt you ive half a
mind to hand you over to the civil
guard for-
 tros had made his signal and the
very well-dressed man had left his char-
iot he was talking fast and tros was
listening in a deeply recessed doorway
conops kept the eunuch too indignant
to observe what was happening he
imagined tros was behind the litter-
eurtains but he couldnt get past conops
to discover his mistake and when he
screamed to the bearers to march they
were prevented by the jews
  tros done listening in the doorway
thumped his fist into his left hand
 no i tell you do you know what
no means i will have no part in trea-
son you take advantage of my hatred
of bearing tales to come and tell me of
a plot that would cost the lives of doz-
ens of you were i even to whisper your
name
  as for that lord tros your life is
as easy to take as other mens betray
me and sign your own death warrant
keep your threats for cowards aris-
tobulus i will give you a piece of in-
formation-not for your own sake for
i think you a loose-tongued lecher who
would sell his best friend but for the
sake of better men who might be swept
into the same net with you the princess
arsinoe is not in egypt i left her in
cyprus-
  but i say she is in egypt
  you call me a liar are you armed
  no
  then govern your speech i say i
left arsinoe in cyprus well watched
guarded by roman soldiers and a com-
pany of pirates-eighty men whom i
made prisoner and turned over to her
for a bodyguard
  couldnt she come with her pirates
to egypt
  about as easily as daedalus flew
from crete to sicily give her wings
and a fair wind scare away the eagles
and she might get half-way then shed
have a long swim aristobulus
  so you are on the queens side
  i am not on your side
  did you know the queen has de-
nounced you as a pirate
  i know she hasnt
  well her minister did
  that is different the queen of
egypt doesnt denounce she kills and
explains or is silent denunciation is the
cackle of a sail-trimmer guessing himself
into the queens good graces no one
will ever need to denounce you aristob-
ulus your friends will find your man-
gled carcass on the city trash-heap un-
less you can think of a less clownish plot
than this that you have told me
  look to it lord tros that you tell
no one
  look to your own tongue mine
obeys me

adventure
  tros returned to the litter and was
into it behind the curtains before the
eunuch saw him there was a crowd
eagerly listening to the argument be-
tween him and conops the alexan-
drines despised sailors and a sailor in
armor with bow-legs and only one eye
was an obvious buff for anybodys hu-
mor from a safe distance
  and court eunuchs were as much de-
spised as hated the local wits were
doing their ribald utmost to incite co-
nops to use his weapon
  but no two pairs of landsmens eyes
were as good as the one that glinted be-
neath the rim of conops helmet he
had seen tros return to the litter he
saw another man not so well dressed
approach and whisper through the cur-
tains so he invented a brand-new set
of reasons for delay
  he accused the eunuch of having de-
manded money and of having decamped
because tros refused to pay him tros
had spoken through the curtains to no
less than three different whisperers be-
fore conops suddenly cut short the ar-
gument by ordering the jews to fall in
again and resume the march
  he put himself at their head the
eunuch unable to force his way through
the crowd had to follow the procession
fuming
	conops led toward the pal-
          ace by short cuts he avoided
the densely thronged street of
 canopus and made for the
guardhouse at the main gate by a route
forbidden to the public there were
armed guards lurking ready to pounce
on intruders and either rob and beat
them or turn them over to the police
but they recognized the royal litter and
besides eleven well armed men were too
many to tackle but the main gate was
another story
  there the mercenary polyglot mag-
nificently accoutred guards were lined
up to keep petitioners from invading the
palace grounds and to keep a way clear
for the going and coming of palace traf-
fic captain leander in leopard-skin and
crimson strolled to the litter and drew
the curtain
  mystery of mysteries he lisped so
tros is with us it had been lord
tros-lord captain tros six weeks
ago and remember me lord captain
when you need a favor he pretended
to study a list of names on a parchment
scroll you have a permit
  i have access to the palace
  ah but there have been changes
recently the old list has been can-
celed and i cant find your name on
the new one
  send in my name to the queen
  she is absent
  i will wait for her
  she has left no command to admit
you
  why then was the litter sent to
bring me hither
  tros got out and conops came and
buckled on his sword the officer was
as tall as tros and looked taller in his
plumed helmet but he looked frail in
comparison he stepped backward and
two of his men stepped forward before
he could resume his careless ease of man-
ner and vaguely contemptuous tone of
voice
  i believe the lord chamberlain
wished to let you know that there have
been reports concerning you that make
your presence at the palace not so wel-
come as formerlv
  so
  another officer approached and whis-
pered leander nodded
  there is a law against armed slaves
have you anything in writing tros to
establish your right to ignore the law
these jews of yours were given to you
by esias they are armed unless my
eyes deceive me i was drunk last night
at the palace banquet but those look
to me like swords and armor
  he made a gesture a platoon of
cleopatras promise

twenty men stepped forward and
grounded the butts of their spears with
an ominous thud the crowd of on-
lookers became excited all alexandrine
crowds became excited at the least ex-
cuse but to see lord captain tros de-
scending from a royal litter to be put
under arrest by the queens guards was
sheer drama they began to shout
  pirate samothracian traitor judo-
phile
  that last word was a danger signal
almost the easiest way to start a riot
was to insinuate that jews were in some
way involved one-third of the popula-
tion jews were two-thirds of the politi-
cal problem popular and unpopular in
about equal proportion always enjoy-
ing special privileges always being per-
secuted
  that the crowd accused tros of be-
friending jews suggested that esias
might be in trouble the crowd took its
cue from the court perhaps the queen
had turned against esias
  tros began to wish he had left his
jews on board the ship not from fear
of the crowd nor of the queens guards
but because he needed to be less con-
spicuous in order to learn what he want-
ed to know a man in the midst of a
racial riot isnt likely to learn much
more than a possible way of escape
  he commanded his jews to produce
their evidence that they were freedmen
leander examined the documents flick-
ing his teeth with his thumb-nail at an
obvious loss what to do or to say next
  you may tell the queen said tros
that i wont submit myself to further
insult from her lackeys
  without saluting he turned his back
and marched away in the midst of his
escort grim faccd leaving the stuttering
eunuch to take the litter where he
pleased and to invent what lies he
pleased the crowd made way for him
gaping doubting whether to enjoy his
embarrassment or to marvel at his heroic
bearing
  he looked not at all like a man in
disfavor disgrace or distress there was
scorn in his eyes and on his shoulders
an air of relief he looked free of the
earth as if he foresaw great events and
a wide horizon
  his ten jews looked crestfallen for it
was a poor start for their first days free-
dom and conops with his helmet a bit
to one side resembled nothing on earth
but a levantine sailor alert for trouble
glancing backward suspicious in fear
of pursuit
  but tros too splendidly contemptu-
ous to shrug his shoulders strode like a
conqueror
  they had marched all the way along
the waterfront and reached the hepta-
stadium where a wide street crossed the
city at right angles to the street of ca-
nopus before tros halted for a minute
or two he stood with his back to the
city and stared at the gigantic marble
lighthouse on pharos island and at the
gay-hued crowd that swarmed along the
connecting causeway-that causeway
from which he had seen caesar plunge
and swim for his life
  one has followed us master said
conops

  aye
  let him draw near
  master he appears to have no weap-
on but be careful such as he would
pretend to deliver a note and produce a
cubits length of poisoned damascus
dagger
  little man if my name were on the
death-list we should be in a dungeon
now awaiting the executioners conve-
nience since we set foot ashore four
different men have tried to fathom me
we are no use dead the queen needs
living legs for her endangered throne
sail away master we could haul out

 very well then in tyre

 aye and refit on the broad atlan-
 tic
 master we could get plenty of men
 from the balearics
does he draw near
 aye he looks treacherous he seems
 to be waiting his chance to approach
 unnoticed
 what is he
a blackamoor-one of the bath at-
tendants
 demand his business
 tros didnt even turn his head he
 was still staring at the pharos-he and
 his escort forming a little island in the
 midst of the stream of people swarming
 toward the city-when conops returned
master he bade me say this the
queen is on lake mareotis
 tros nodded for a minute or two he
 was silent then he turned and they
 stared at each other
 little man were it not for my good
 northmen who must be found and res-
 cued i would burn this ship and go
 elsewhere and build another but the
 queen has us cornered
 master let those toss-pot axe-men
 rot-aye and the wenching basques

 men put out your eye and made you
 half a sailor

 ings-stores of stuff from india and
 from punt-hemp too-and sheds for
 the slaves it was there that our basques
 made trouble for us by breaking into
 the compound where esias keeps the
 virgins for the household market
 you were with them i remember
 aye preventing-
 to the tune of a virgin for whom i
reimbursed esias for the loss of value
she seduced me master she was a

chapter iii
i prefer the queen s trap to that
other
again no sign of old esias
his block of buildings was al-
most a city itself marble-
walled and colonnaded where
it faced a great gap in the city wall but
built of brick in the rear and divided
into a maze of crowded compounds
  alexandria lay between lake mareo-
tis and the sea and the lake-front was
a long line of parks and promenade
there were a boat harbor dozens of
wine-booths some expensive restau-
rants and great gaps in the wall planted
with ornamental trees
  the wall was useless for defensive pur-
poses the cross-city canal emerged be-
neath a marble bridge not far from
esias warehouse westward of that the
lake shore was reedy and unconfined
by a bulkhead but to the eastward was
cleopatras promise

the royal wharf and beyond that the
entire lake front was of well-built ma-
sonry
  the size of the lake was unguessable
there were so many islands fringed with
papyrus many of them white with the
marbled roofs of villas there was al-
ways a haze that blended lake and sky
and through that threaded countless
boats some from the nile through the
thronged canal laden with the produce
of the richest land on earth
  there were miles of staked nets and
hundreds of fishing boats and amid
them all blazing with paint were the
awninged yachts of the wealthier alex-
andrines
  leaving his escort in the colonnade
tros entered the warehouse office-a
huge dim mysterious chamber beamed
with rough-hewn olive stacked with
merchandise and shelves of scrolls and
reeking of spice nathan the third in
seniority of esias partners loomed forth
from the dimness solemn as a vulture
but almost painfully eager to seem cour-
teous six slaves bowed behind him
  greeting greeting where is my
friend esias tros asked
  instead of answering nathan led into
an inner office a mere cabin of a place
with a window that gave a view of a
compound where some slaves were being
taught to read and write greek to in-
crease their market value
  lord captain esias does not dare
to be seen speaking to you neither do
i dare to say why-not even to you
within four walls esias is with wit-
nesses who will prove he has not spoken
to you
  and he sends me no message
yes he says look to your life
and i add my warning to his lord

adventure
tros we have been forbidden to repair
your trireme
  by whom
  the less mention of names the better
-but by the same minister who has pro-
claimed you a pirate
  publicly
  yes officially no at a banquet at
the palace where he made a speech to
some roman notables who have come
overland from cassius headquarters
seeking money and men he referred to
you by name as a seditious alien whom
pompeius magnus would have known
how to drive from the sea
  and the queen
  said nothing
  aye she is good at saying nothing
did she say it in many words
  i know not my informant told me
that throughout all the speech-making
she reclined on her divan and played
with a persian kitten as if the world
might go to wrack and ruin for all she
cared and now she is on pleasure
island with her child and her women
they say that cassius envoys have re-
turned to syria empty-handed except
for some trashy presents and her barge
lies waiting at the royal boat wharf-
and-
  one of the royal barge slaves was
in here asking for you
 when
  he left not ten minutes ago he
pretended to be needing a new brass
thole-pin but he found fault with what
we offered and he asked what thole-
pins you use thus one word leading
to another he conversed about your tri-
reme and then wondered where you are
he said that the commander of the
royal barge would esteem your advice
on certain matters and that it would be
well for us to let the barge-eommander
know if you should show up
  that is not all nathan there is
something else on your mind what is
it
  lord tros as you know i am no
alarmist but there have been others
asking for you two freedmen clients of
a man named aristobolus they also
wanted news of you if you should turn
up
  any reason
  yes they lied they declared they
were clients of hippias the rhodian
who is very wealthy and is said to stand
high in the queens favor but i knew
them the rogues forgot that it was i
who sold them thirteen years ago when
rabirius the roman money-lender
ruined their former master they said
hippias wishes to do you a favor but
without attracting public notice they
said hippias boat awaits you in the
reeds down near the public bath-house
half a furlong westward they said if
you will take hippias boat it will con-
vey you to him and he will accompany
you into the queens presence where he
will have much to sav in vour behalf
and-
  i happen to know that hippias is at
dendera visiting the estate from which
he draws his income
 and-
 they bade me warn you to come
alone
  tros laughed nathan i prefer the
queens trap to that other sell me a
change of clothing i am filthy from
the dust of these streets
  lord tros why risk your life in
either trap it is safer in rome than in
alexandria leave your trireme in esias
keeping there is another corn fleet mak-
ing ready we can smuggle you and a
few of your men to puteoli you have
a big credit with us we can give you
drafts on our office in rome and i
will give you a list of the names of sena-
tors who can be bribed to do anything
to forget everything and to appoint the
most improbable men to the most im-
portant positions they will vote you
roman citizenship they will make you
a roman admiral then remember your
friends
cleopatras promise

  bring me new clothing nathan i
will visit the source of all this mystery
trick me up like an alexandrine exqui-
site
  but lord tros-
  and while you get the clothing send
in my man conops
  nathan gloomed out to do tros bid-
ding and presently conops clanked into
the office he was never quite certain
how to treat these powerful but some-
times timid and almost always deferen-
tial jews whom tros so confidently
trusted
  he was wiping his mouth with the
back of his hand his manner midway
between impudence and respect for
prodigious wealth but another mood
shone in his eye when he saw through
the window the slave-girls learning
greek and about a dozen others in a
comer of the compound learning to sing
greek songs and to dance suggestive
illustrations of the theme
  drinking already eh never mind
those women stand with your back to
the window now then do you know
of a place half a furlong to westward
near the public bath-house where a boat
might make an unseen landing in the
reeds
  aye master where the south wind
drives the floating islands inshore it is
the place where the runaway slaves hide
until nightfall and as often as not get
snapped up by crocodiles
  march your men hither and back
and report to me whether a boat lies
hidden if any one questions you say
where i am you may say i am here
in conference you may say i am going
alone to the royal barge presently you
may say you expect to be drunk tonight
and if they give you some largess for
your wine and women you may buy one
small jar of wine eleven fishing-lines
and hooks and enough bait for a few
hours fishing
  then after you have reported to me
watch and if you see them leave the
boat you may send eight of your men to
seize it taking the wine and fish-lines
with them you and the two remaining
men will guard me as far as the royal
boat wharf
  when i am safe on the royal barge
you may make haste to the other boat
-pull off your armor all of you-row
out into the lake follow the royal barge
as closely as you dare drop anchor as
near as you dare to the royal island and
remain there fishing until you see me
return on the royal barge or until i
signal for you
  better take along some food as well
as wine it may be dark before i need
you and remember dont be conspic-
uous try to look like fishermen or
at least like a party of alexandrine
tradesmen keeping holiday have you
understood me
  aye aye master
  then do it
there was a good deal of
fuss about clothing nothing
but the best would do for
tros and by the time na-
thans slaves had bathed him and ar-
rayed him in linen good enough for the
queen herself and the expert slave-girls
had arranged a chaplet in his hair tros
looked hardly like the same man
  he looked if anything more powerful
because the almost transparent linen be-
trayed the bulge of his muscles but he
looked like a courtier not a fighting
man he looked too elegant to care for
anything but luxuries wine women and
song conops breathless from his errand
stood and gawked at him
  well
  boat yes that fellow aristobolus
and four freedmen knives aristobolus
gave me money as you said he might
he said his name is hippias and he
asked after your health so i told him
what you said i was to tell him and he
looked as savage as a man whose drinks
been spilled so i came back and ive

adventure
bought the wine and bread and eggs and
smoked fish and some olive oil and let-
tuce and a couple of melons master
half a jars an awful little for eleven
men and ten of em just received free-
dom and not a drink since cyprus
very well make it a jar
  theres no more money
  give them a full jar nathan mind
you if you get as drunk as you did in
cyprus ill reduce you to the lower oar-
bench youre to divide the wine
equally drink for drink that is an
order have you understood it
  aye aye master but i hadnt fin-
ished telling we werent back here be-
fore those four reedmen hit our wake
and came strolling along like loafers
with nothing better to do eastward of
here and this side of the royal boat
wharf theres a wine-garden set in a
grove of myrtles and oleanders thats
where they are and not drinking either
-lurking-up to no good
  aristobolus still in the boat
  yes master thats to say unless he
slipped away without us seeing him id
be willing to wager my share of the
drinks lies there yet
  then he likely is there send your
eight men to seize the boat they
neednt be too gentle with aristobolus
but theyre not to kill him if they can
help it let them throw him in the bot-
tom of the boat and tie and gag him
they may as well take the provisions
with them you and your other two fol-
low me and follow closely
  aye aye master are we to have
aristobolus company in the boat all
afternoon
 yes you may un-gag him when
youre out on the lake use your own
judgment about pretending to agree to
any treachery he may suggest memo-
rize his words-his exact words
  aye aye master
  eight men trusted for the first time
with a dangerous task without conops
superintending eye and looking inno-
cent enough in spite of armor with
their load of wine and provisions
tramped away eastward down the road
between the buildings and the shore
tros with his sword beneath his left
arm hidden by an apparently carelessly
draped himation strolled westward ap-
pearing to enjoy the freshness of the
early afternoon breeze conops followed
him jeshua and aroun trudged at
conops heels
  there was a considerable crowd along
the road to eastward many of them
were slaves permitted a days idleness
on account of the festival but there
were scores of gaily dressed and well-
behaved families enjoying the view or
hiring row-boats or strolling from one
public garden or one wine-booth to an-
other and there was a considerable
number of chariots being driven at the
usual reckless speed by gallants not yet
drunk enough to kill deliberately but
with enough wine in their heads to en-
joy scattering the crowd like scared
poultry
  there was a disturbance of that kind
as tros drew abreast of the myrtle and
oleander thicket two racing chariots
swerved around the western corner of
the thicket and headed eastward giving
tros their dust and scattering a scream-
ing score of men and women
  conops snarled a warning theyre
on us draw you chosen people
  tros sword licked out like the flash of
lightning his himation danced on his
left arm conops leaped he plunged
his knife into a mans throat the jews
buried their swords in the bellies of two
other men tros slew the fourth driv-
ing the point through his heart with
such force that conops had to stand on
the mans body in order to wrench the
sword out
  it was all over in almost a second
like a flurry of wind in a copse or the
swoop of a hawk  a dove-cote a few
of the wine-gardens customers peered
through the thicket but no crowd
cleopatras promise

formed on the contrary those in the
street who had seen what happened
scurried out of sight to avoid trouble
  it was nothing very unusual that a
man should be set upon by his enemys
freedmen drunken brawls and unpaid
debts the volatile affections of a woman
or even a topical song was enough to
start a street fight the municipal slaves
would remove the bodies unless the
dead mens friends first did it
  meanwhile fishermen hurried ashore
to be first to steal clothing and money
and finger-rings on the pretext of lay-
ing the bodies beside the road they
even demanded pay for doing that from
passers-by because alexandrines dis-
liked to see blood on a glorious may
afternoon
  they were not like romans they
could always be persuaded to pay to
protect their squeamishness by the time
tros had cleaned his sword with sand
and water and conops had wiped it dry
the incident was in a fair way to being
forgotten
  tros dismissed conops and the two
jews as soon as they had cleaned their
weapons
  that gales done with make haste
now and get the boat off-shore ill be
safe between here and the queens
barge
  aye aye master
chapter iv
it is your throne
the approach to the royal
boat wharf through the gate
of the sun-a gate that no
longer existed because the
wall had been demolished at that point
to make room for imported trees-was
almost the only egyptian touch in the
whole city with its guardian sphynxes
and statues stolen from ancient nile-
bank temples
  the marble boat-shed was of egyptian
design and even the attending slaves
were garbed in the ancient egyptian
head-dress it was a sort of symbolical
gateway here one entered into egypt
today greece-europe ceased yes-
terday mystery melancholy and the
fabled land of khem began
  even the boats on mareotis were of
the ancient egyptian pattern many of
the luxurious villas and pavilions on the
islands were designed to suggest the
egyptian spirit in curious contrast to
the ultra-modern greek design of alex-
andria
  there were scores of sentries to keep
the holiday-making crowd at a respect-
ful distance from the royal boat wharf
but nobody challenged tros he was
not saluted but he was not questioned
he enjoyed a sensation of being seen
and yet intentionally unseen as if he
were expected even welcome and yet
unmentionable
  he decided to test the situation and
approached a lieutenant of the guard
who yawned and peacocked on the ter-
race in front of the egyptian arch at
the landward end of the marble jetty
  promoted i see tysander i con-
gratulate you have i blood on my
clothing
  the officer examined him from head
to foot
  no but i saw that little entertain-
ment good sword
  six short weeks ago ty sander would
have called him by name with simulated
if not actual respect
  i thank you tysander
  better leave your sword here
  my man has it
  tros threw back his himation in proof
that he was unarmed the lieutenant
nodded and tros strolled through the
arch not exactly expecting to be dag-
gered on the far side but in his minds
eye measuring three jumps from the
arch to the water however the slaves
who stood with their backs to the arch-
like statues took no notice of him

adventure
  the gilded barge lay moored against
the jetty with its sixteen rowers in their
places they tossed oars as tros strolled
through the arch there was no doubt
they were waiting for him the royal
barge-commander stood on the jetty
actually smiling looking a bit bacchana-
lian because his chaplet was awry but
spic and span in cleopatras new
emerald-and-orange uniform she had a
great gift for designing uniforms that
made a man look picturesque but subtly
menial
 have you a dagger on you he
asked may i feel
  again no mention of tros name an
air of almost but not quite cordiality
the best seat on the barge in the stern
behind the queens awninged bridge-
deck no salute from the rowers but
on the other hand respectful service
from the barge slaves who blew the dust
from tros sandals and sponged and
wiped his legs
 no command every one knew what
to do the gaudily dressed sailors cast
off and the barge went at top speed
toward pleasure island with the tubas
blowing to make fishermen and holiday
boating-parties scoot out of the way
no conversation not even between the
barge-commauder and his lieutenant
  there was nothing to interfere with
tros interest in the passing scene and
it was not long before he had picked out
the gaily painted pleasure boat in which
conops and the ten jews were pretend-
ing to be out for an afternoons amuse-
ment
  eight of the jews were rowing and
like all strong men untrained to that
difficult art they were making heavy
weather of it they could easily pass for
a boat-load of drunken roisterers per-
haps in a stolen boat but surely not
armed and dangerous
  pleasure island loomed took form
revealed itself in a reedy mirage two or
three miles beyond the staked deep-
water channel for the laden barges from
the nile it provided absolute privacy
even its flower-carpeted banks were in-
visible until the barge had gone beyond
it and turned and approached from the
southward the thump of the oars
alarming myriads of water-fowl that took
wing from the reeds and filled the air
with weird music
  then the first sight was of naked
greek girls some bathing and others
playing games against a background of
marbled terraces and columned pavil-
ions there was not a man in sight not
even a eunuch except for a guardboat
half hidden in a water-lane between the
reeds
  there were probably several guard-
boats but only one was visible the
attendants on the boat-jetty were
egyptian slave-girls dog-eyed bare-
breasted their white teeth flashed in
sensuous smiles their dark skins were
like shadows against the sunlit marble
  they made the boat fast no one
spoke to tros as he walked up the
marble path between flowers the sound
of girls laughter didnt cease for an in-
stant even when the path skirted one
end of the terrace on which the naked
girls were playing and he was in full
view no one stared at him he knew
at least half of those girls-knew their
fathers and mothers they were the
cream of the alexandrine aristocracy he
had been offered his pick of them dozens
of times by a court chamberlain who
would have been delighted to ally him
by marriage with the ascendant political
faction but he might have been invis-
ible for all the notice they took
  the first greeting he received at the
top of the steps on the terrace in front
of the pavilion door was from the lady
charmion looking like one of the fates
with her needle and thread and her vine-
gary air of prim chastity in classically
draped white chinese silk she looked
up from her sewing to answer his bow
  the queen expects you you may go
straight in the child caesarion has just
cleopatras promise

been punished for saying he loves you
perhaps he does tros answered
was it you who had him punished
yes she almost spat the word go
in and try to redeem yourself you will
need the full resources of your sam-
othracian guile i can assure you
  i will keep my guile he answered
bowing like a courtier for gilding my
esteem where tart ingratitude occasion-
ally chafes it thin
  he loved to annoy her three ladies-
in-waiting who were doing embroidery-
work with charmion and pretending to
like it giggled tros nodded to them
and entered the pavilion down a cor-
ridor where seven eunuchs sat on a
gilded bench whispering and smirking
like priests in a vestry
  one of them opened a door and then
for the first time some one called tros
by name the child caesarion a brat
hardly able to toddle but precocious
and looking already like a miniature
copy of julius caesar ran through the
doorway and fell at his feet seizing his
legs and calling him twos of sam-
othwakee there was at any rate some-
one pleased to see him
  but the child was swept up by a
protesting nurse and borne off yelling
for his hero then a golden voice that
had no equal anywhere
  you may come in
the eunuch closed the
door behind him and he was
alone with the queen she
was in one of her strangely
magnetic moods that nobody ever knew
how to divine-greenish eyes brooding
-rather sensuous lips smiling-looking
smaller than ever because she was seated
in a huge chair facing the view through
the open window
  her exquisitely shapely feet touched
with henna in gold-leafed sandals
rested on a footstool of carved ivory
on the table beside her were pen and
ink and a number of parchment scrolls
that fluttered in the slight breeze and
on a long table against the wall were a
number of objects obviously rifled from
an ancient tomb in her hands was a
golden bracelet
  tros caught his breath he bowed
low with his eyes on the bracelet it
was not egyptian it was not greek
indian chinese arabian nor persian
it was heavy solid hammered and in-
dented with an unfinished pattern that
bore no resemblance to any known
egyptian design barbaric and yet mas-
terfully conceived and done
  he had hard work to show no emo-
tion when he had finished bowing and
stood upright it almost never paid to
betray emotion in cleopatras presence
it was vastly safer to simulate emotion
that one did not feel
  she appeared annoyed that he had
seen the bracelet
  can you imagine she asked a
craftsman competent to do such skill-
ful work who would nevertheless be
such a savage as to take a wrought gold
vase from an ancient tomb and smash
it and then desecrate it into such an
ornament as this who could wear such
a thing it weighs two pounds
  tros glanced at the priceless objects
on the table-necklaces vases glass-
ware bracelets a golden tablet a yard
square covered with hieroglyphics
  he might have smashed those too
he answered
  he knew who had done it there was
only one man south of the baltic who
would even have thought of making such
a bracelet as lay on cleopatras knee
she laid the bracelet aside
  well she asked after a moment
why dont you reproach me
  royal egypt i reproach myself he
answered
  for having failed me
  for having trusted you
  her answering smile was dangerous
she fingered one of the scrolls on the

adventure
table beside her it was a list of about
a dozen names
  these are dead she remarked she
picked up another shorter list these
are at the moment dying they be-
tray one another like true greeks at the
first touch of torture it is not that they
are cowards or i think not pain makes
them angry they resent that their ac-
complices should escape such torment
so they tell
  tros almost shrugged his shoulders
it is your throne egypt keep it if
you care to
if i can ske looked battle-angry
tros grinned then it was the first
confession he had ever heard from cleo-
patras lips that there might be an easier
seat than a throne
 she resented his grin her mood
changed to the snake-like anger that
made her terrible she spoke with the
vibrance in her voice that aroused mens
superstition-the voice that had made
her name a byword-astonishing from
such a small woman not in the least
loud but vigorous with a sort of abso-
luteness
  i sent for you she said to receive
from your lips an explanation of your
conduct in cyprus
  but she was threatening the wrong
man and she knew it her eyes changed
even before tros answered
 you have a strange way royal
egypt of inviting a friend to an audi-
ence it would have been simpler to
have written my name on that list to
explain to the executioner-or not to
explain as the case might be
  dont talk nonsense i have a reason
for seeing you secretly
  doubtless a royal reason i would
have spared you the intrusion unless i
also had reasons egypt as for what i
have done at my own cost-
  on your own responsibility you re-
fused my commission remember
  it was the best i could do i de-
feated and slew the pirate anchises and
destroyed his entire fleet
 yes and you sank two roman
biremes in salamis harbor for which
the roman proconsul cassius is blam-
ing me
  to which your answer has been to
permit your minister to denounce me
as a pirate
  that was necessary it was a sop
to his roman indignation
  as t already said it is your throne
he retorted having no throne and
not willing to have one t have never
found it necessary to denounce a loyal
friend for the sake of such a cur as
cassius who stabbed his benefactor if
you choose between me and cassius as
to which is your friend i withdraw from
the competition deadly though it may
be i prefer your enmity to the stench
of being less than cassius enemy to the
last breath he or i shall ever breathe
she laughed the same tros friend
you you speak to me as if i were your
mistress or a servant caught stealing
the food from the table is my sister
arsinoe not my enemy my treacher-
ous envious enemy didnt you befriend
her in cyprus do you call that being
my friend
  what would you have had me do
you should have drowned her she
was on your ship she was present in
the sea-fight off salamis-where i would
give almost my eyes to have been she
was present in your cabin when you
brow-beat that old roman wolf aheno-
barbus i would give almost my ears
to have heard that you gave her
money it was tribute money looted
from the temple you gave her men
they were pirates whom you took pris-
oner and roman legionaries for whom
ahenobarbus had no ship-room you
set her free from serapions clutches-
serapion whom i appointed to be her
viceroy because i knew he would hold
her powerless whatever treachery he
might invent
cleopatras promise
  i perceive that your spy etruscan
tarquinius has saved me the necessity
of making a report tros answered
  i have a letter from him written on
the very day that you returned to sala-
mis after the sea-fight it came in sec-
tions by eighteen pigeons to the syrian
coast and thence by runner
  surely you show great wisdom in
taking that jackals word against mine
tros answered did he write it to you
or to charmion
  she ignored the question suddenly
in a voice that suggested an archers
tautened bow-string she loosed her
secret news
  my dear sister arsinoe is gone from
cyprus
  tros stared at her trying to read her
eyes but he could only judge that she
was studying him as alertly as he was
studying her if she was telling the
truth he was in as deadly danger as
he ever had been in in the whole of his
dangerous life did she suspect him of
conspiracy he did the opposite of
what any other man in egypt would
have dared to do he told her the truth
i had been in alexandria not three
hours egpyt before several men of
whom one was your spy-i knew him-
told me that tale your spy-he spoke
with me near the municipal building-
said she is in egpyt i wouldnt have
believed that rogue if he had told me
the day of the week he invited me to
go to her to command her army did
he tell you my answer
  she smiled he said you spoke with
aristobolus and with two others the
two others are in custody where is
aristobolus
  tros grinned  can answer for four
of his freedmen they attacked me lest
i should betray aristobolus
bloodshed again-in the city i am
told you have freed some slaves that
they may bear arms are you planning
to send them broiling in the royal
arena as did your northmen
  he was glad to change the subject
  i came here he answered to claim
my northmen of your magnaminity
release them the only crime they com-
mitted was to break the heads of some
romans for speaking about you loosely
do you remember my terms she
retorted you may have them when
you have kept your own promise
i have kept it egpyt your
war-fleet captains had aban-
doned the com fleet to its
fate i found it and protected
it from romans and from pirates also
i sold the com to brutus because he
and cassius are at the moment the great-
est potential danger to you unless they
can feed their armies
  and you have loosed against me a
more dangerous a more treacherous
enemy than any roman arsinoe i tell
you is in egypt do you call that doing
me a service well for you lord tros
that i mistrust tarquinius he has
written a letter to you in care of the
jew esias to await your coming and it
fell into my hands as i dont doubt he
intended it should
  he informs you in that letter that
the princess arsinoe acting on your
advice mind you has taken those pirates
that you gave her and some men that
my loving cousin herod offered and
some of the gaulish legionaires that
ahenobarbus left behind in cyprus and
has crossed to syria
  at the time of writing she expected
cassius to help her to reach egypt be-
cause cassius would prefer a queen on
the throne of egpyt who is more sub-
servient to roman arrogance
  i should have slain that rat tar-
quinius when you put him aboard my
ship to spy on me tros answered
you know him as well as i do and he
knows me as well as you do i will wager
that he wrote that letter to persuade
you to mistrust both me and esias who
are the two men in egypt who cant be
adventure
bribed to betray you may i see the
letter
  yes no-no i havent it here she
studied him for at least a minute then
suddenly you are a sentimentalist
could you be coaxed to betray me
  i have been coaxed with hard blows
and soft speech egypt but here i am
i am sending you to deal with
arsinoe
 me
  you-secretly-finally-once and for
all she has several hundred men
she moves on memphis the ancient
capital where she expects to be able
to raise an army but i have my grip
on memphis i hold hostages i have
the sons and daughters of most of
the important men of memphis who
might otherwise go to her aid she has
raided the quarterly caravan from the
emerald mines and she is robbing the
tomb-robbers for gold with which to
lavish bribes i have caught the ring-
leaders in alexandria but all the romans
in the city and many others would take
her part if she should begin to succeed
she must be dealt with swiftly
  i am useless without my northmen
  you useless
  will against will it was almost like
a physical clash of weapons
  royal egypt you are too fond of
clipping the wings of the hawk that
shall fly your errands you obliged me
to go to sea without my northmen i
fought a battle that i came near losing
for lack of their good fighting arms
a few barbarians-a mere handful of
brutes with battle-axes
 thirty-eight comrades in arms
thirty-eight veterans egypt have you
their equal
  she eyed him darkly resting her chin
on her hand it is not soldiers or sailors
but generals that i need she said after
a moment i can supply you with plenty
of men
  aye he answered but you havent
one commander whom you dare to trust
out of reach of the executioner so you
propose to flatter me by-
  yes she interrupted i fear  flatter
you but there is no one else i can trust
at the moment i want her killed not
captured tros incredible though this
may sound to you i love arsinoe i
saved her from execution after caesars
triumph when she should have been
slain in the tullianuin if the roman
mob had had its way it was i who had
to beg caesar to make her queen of cy-
prus but the girl is my ceaseless enemy
there is nothing to do but to kill her
therefore you degrade me to the
rank of butcher
  i wish her to be killed-not shamed-
not put to torture-not cruelly ill-used
as she would ill-use me if she could
seize my throne she must die and
you of all men understand that
  it was useless to fence with cleopatra
when she talked in that vein she lied
and tros knew it she neither loved
nor pitied arsinoe although it was no
doubt true that she would take no delight
in arsinoes shame or torture she
merely wanted her killed and to avoid
the blame for having killed her
  pitying the girl said tros in the
fight off salamis i gave her a chance to
die as you or i would choose to if the
world should have no honorable room
for you or me but she fought too well
in one of my mens armor she came
out unscathed with her dagger dripping
and a laugh on her lips
  tros-i believe you love her
egypt i love man or woman who is
brave
  it is more than rumored that she
loves you
  so am i indictable by rumor
  if you love her-if she loves you-
need i explain that loving-kindness
should grant her a swift death rather
than the ignominy of for instance such
a punishment as your elder sister ber-
enice underwent it is as an act of
mercy that i send you
cleopatras promise

  have you mercy for my northmen
i depend on your love for your
northmen to outweigh any emotions
that a girl might arouse who is nothing
if not capable of seducing such a senti-
mentalist as you are
  tros strode to the window turned
away from her turned again and strode
back he was thinking of the two-pound
hammered bracelet
 egypt-
  think she warned him she could
see the wrath on his face and the dead-
lier integrity behind it - the iron
resolution
  i have done my thinking egypt i
am no queens catspaw
  she had her hand on the padded ham-
mer of a golden gong shaped like a lions
face
  you refuse
  the threat of death had never made
tros less than obstinate-but craftily
obstinate lightning quick to guess the
weakness that lingered on threat instead
of striking first in order to compel not
for one fraction of a moment did he
forget his duty to his northmen as long
as they lived he would do his best to be
their dependable lord captain
  aye i will not go unless on my own
terms
  name them
  my own discretion if you trust me
to go you shall trust me to do as i see
fit
  oh well she answered indiscretion
would be bad for your northmen you
appreciate that
  he nodded she had laid that heavy
bracelet on the table he glanced at it
then looked straight into her eyes
  and i demand cleopatras promise
not royal egypts but the promise of
the cleopatra whom i snatched away
from rome before caesars murderers
could plunge their knives into you also-
do you understand what i mean i have
been your good friend egypt
  there was no warm emotion expressed
in her eyes she looked even slightly
contemptuous of his claim on her grati-
tude but she seemed to be reappraising
him perhaps wondering whether to tell
him more and to trust him less because
the more a man knows the less easy he
is to compel and as yet she was only
learning statecraft she had not yet
reached the ripeness of judgment that
a few years later almost made her mis-
tress of the world
  how can i make any other that
what you are pleased to call a royal
promise she asked after a moments
pause we were friends you and i when
i was a homeless exile true but who
serves whom for nothing has a queen
friends what request can cleopatra
grant that egypt may not forbid it
must be something strange-something
new in the way of demands on a reigning
queen
  not new in your ears egypt if i go
to memphis-if i solve this riddle for
you-if i quell rebellion before it rocks
your throne-thereafter will you set my
northmen free and rather than hinder
will you aid me to set forth on my
voyage
  she smiled around the world you
will desert me for that chimera very
well then you have egypts promise
that she shall not interfere with cleo-
patras farewell how will you find
arsinoe what guides-what forces will
you need this is secret remember
  i have my own means and my own
men
  she stared his quickness of decision
never failed to bring that frown to her
forehead
  how will you explain my absence
from the city he demanded
  they shall say you have been sent
into exile
  memphis there will be a north
wind i can swoop on memphis i will
be off before daybreak egypt with my
own men tell me what you know of
arsinoes movements

adventure
  i will summon alexis lie has all ihe
information he is to go with you
tros scowled he hated her cynical
courtier friend alexis a man who had
not been long enough at court to pay
his debts
there were two gongs near
her she struck one that
clanged like the clash of cym-
bals instantly the curtains
on the rear wall parted it was the
wrong gong two huge nubians rushed
in cloaked with leopard-skin armed
with brass scimitars trained to be
swift to protect their royal mistress they
rushed tros one from either side too
swiftly for cleopatra to stop them
  they never even saw her raised hand
her voice froze in her throat as a scimitar
slit the air it missed-went spinning-
struck the other negros neck and em-
bedded itself in the door panel tros
fist quicker than the weapon had club-
bed his assailants arm-struck it numb
  his right foot tripped the man his
left fist sent him staggering into the
other nubian and they fell in a mess
of blood at cleopatras feet she looked
angry contemptuous disgusted but not
afraid for a moment tros pitched both
men through the open window
  then he picked up a damascus mat
covered the blood with it strode to the
door pulled the scimitar out from the
panel and tossed that too through the
window
  if i am under arrest he said no
more than your word is needed
  she laughed looking suddenly pleased
it was a mistake
  are they sufficiently rebuked
  i am what an expensive guest you
are lord captain tros those slaves
cost me more than the rug you have
used for a mop i bought that rug in
rome from the spoils of mithridates
palace now the nubians are useless
you may have them you may have the
rug too
  she struck the other gong and then
walked to the window with tros while
a eunuch brought in slaves to clean the
tiled floor the rug was rolled and tossed
through the window to the nubians
one of whom was bandaging his neck
with a rag from his chiton the other
lay stunned on the terrace at a gesture
from the queen the wounded man un-
rolled the rug hove the stunned man on
to it and dragged him out of sight
 cleopatras mood had changed as
utterly as a landscape changes when the
clouds let through the sun she laid
her hand on tros arm
  you who are fitter to be a king than
any warrior on earth-for you have
brains as well as courage-is egypt too
little
  she was almost not quite tall enough
for the crown of her head to reach his
shoulder not answering he stared
through the window southward toward
the fabled land of khem
  do you seek new conquests you
who hate rome as i hate rome and as
rome hates me-there is syria to con-
quer-parthia-india egypt or rome
will prevail in the end but who shall
lead the battleliue of egypt south-
ward-forever southward beyond the
desert aye and beyond the mountains
where they say the nile begins-there
are realms beyond realms awaiting con-
quest does your imagination feel no
challenge
  at last he looked down at her
  aye he answered in this pavilion
you and caesar used to speak of it i
have sat here listening
  you are younger stronger healthier
than caesar was and you are not like
caesar ham-strung by grudging loyalty
to a roman wife and roman prejudices
  no he answered i have other
prejudices
  and no wife
 no nor a master i am my own
man
  gyved by sentiment to two-score
cleopatras promise

 bawdy battle axe-men whobe hearts are
 in the brothels and their brains in the
 lees of a jar of cretan wine
 they are my men they arc com-
 rades-in-arms i have led them they
 and i have fought a main or two with
 death together i will do your errand
 egypt
 you arc also a greater fool than
 caesar knew how to be she answered
 oh that caesar had had your strength
 to shake off his assassins
 do you mean oh that t had caesars
 ambition
 yes i mean it would you like to
 be king of syria
 syria is not yours egypt
 not yet but would you like to be
 king of syria
 no-nor king of anywhere
 go you bore me i will send you
 alexis he shall meet you at the barge
 you know him
 yes i know him
 mind-you are to trust him
 may i trust you to keep your
 promise
 keep your own promise you will
 not need to remind me of mine
chapter v
 one of these days youu be a
 valuable man
sunset was bathing the
roofs of alexandria and the
evening mist was rising on
mareotis when the royal barge
left pleasure island alexis a very hand-
some fellow with a comically aristro-
cratic alexandrine manner of taking
nothing seriously snuggled himself in
a woolen himation and kissed a parch-
ment order on any or all district treas-
urers it bore cleopatras signature
and seal
 no limit he remarked i bless my
 father and my mother who conceived
 me as full of cupidity as a rhakotis
prostitute there are compensations
even for having to leave alexandria
dreadful ordeal but sublime oppor-
tunity when i return i will buy me
arabian horses hitherto mine has never
been better than second chariot it is
simply a question of money buy the
best horses bribe the other fellows
charioteers watch me win next time
better rob tombs like the queen
tros answered the queen keeps her
eye on the treasury statements
  on the tombs too said alexis
mining is a royal monopoly she calls
tombs mining did you notice that stuff
on the table
  where is it from
  near the great pyramid
  tros grinned thinking of his north-
men
  tros youre a very remarkable man
i have you to thank for this treasury
order if it werent for you she would
have sent two generals each to keep an
eye on the other they would have been
much more expensive than you and me
i would give ten per cent of my probable
peculations to know what you said to
the queen
  you buy things twice over do you
tros answered you heard every word
of what i said to her
  well since you have guessed so ac-
curately i admit it i was behind the
curtain i saw you smash those nubians
gods look at them i dont know yet
whether she meant them to kill you or
not and ill bet they dont know either
perhaps she doesnt know i think she
left it to destiny the way you or i would
toss a coin or bet a fortune on a cock-
fight she is like that-superstitious
what will you do with the nubians
oar-bank i never yet knew a royal
slave worth a drachma until he had
learned what work is they shall blister
their hams and work the fat off that
duffer let go his scimitar at a mere
touch
  a pretty skilful touch tros

adventure
  but a touch he shall learn what it
means to hang on to an oar with the
wind across the current and the ship
rolling it needs more than muscle will
you take them to esias for me and bid
him keep them at heavy labor until i
return from this business them and
the rug that is my rug remember i
believe you will find esias in his office
at the east end of the city you will
find me near my trireme
  i am supposed to keep you in sight
can you swim very well go ashore
in the barge and find esias bring him
to me i am to trust you she said so
 will until you give me reason not to
let us understand each other
  oh i understand you
  let me know when you dont on
any successful expedition there is only
one commander there is only one way
of returning home alive and not dis-
graced that is by obeying the com-
mander i am he
  alexis got up and bowed as impudently
as he dared
  i salute you should i call you
caesar
  you may call me friend if you will
 will judge you by behavior
  tros went forward and pushing aside
the lookout man stood for several min-
utes with his hand on the high carved
gilded stem suddenly he plunged over-
board and was out of sight in a moment
lost to view in the mist that curled amid
the rushes he swam as many strong
men do with prodigious waste of effort
and it was several minutes before his
hand caught the rail of a painted pleas-
ure-boat and conops hauled him over-
side
  master let me rub you dry with my
shirt this chill air-
  give me food you idiot do you
think i can go since daybreak on an
empty belly and wait to be bath-housed
by a drunkard is there wine left
aye aye master i saved some from
the jews share i said to the jews i
said itd need an artful eunuch i said
to poison the lord captain but if he
comes to you parched from mistrusting
palace wine would you have him drink
up mareotis frogs and all eh frogs
i said to em said i are against religion
arent you jews circumcised i said
against the sin of eating frogs so shall
he drink em here you are master
good wine wine of chios kept it cool
too here you are bread cheese
olives-
  where is aristobolus
  one of the jews removed a disordered
sail aristobolus lay bound and gagged
under the thwarts tros ate ravenously
  head for the cross-city canal row
slowly enter the canal in darkness has
aristobolus talked
  aye master as soon as wed un-
gagged him and hed wetted his throat
with some of our chian he began talking
a streak never heard such wild talk
as his not even from our northmen
when theyre drunk and homesick for
the baltic women any word of our
northmen master
  aye when we get back sort out all
their battle-axes and armor from the
store-room wrap them in a sail and
have them ready
  trust you to make a landfall fog or
night-time
  carry on with your tale
  master maybe one of our lads hit
him a bit hefty he talked wild soon
as he saw it was me and me your man
and us all laughing and acting foolish
and out o reach o land and all that first
he offered us money so we took what
he had and it was little enough for a
gentleman of his fine speech and man-
ners then we fed him but he didnt eat
much and i told him hes your prisoner
and you not in the habit o treating
prisoners the way a pirate treats em-
pirate though he said you are he loosed
off a fathom o talk about your being a
pirate and the queen intending to have
you crucified because the romans want
cleopatras promise

it and he said that if we love you we
should find you quick and let him tell
you how to keep your soul inside your
body
 you remember his exact words
 no master they were too many
twenty men couldnt remember em
but he talked like a hawse paying out
in a tide-rip how wed better find you in
a hurry so i said youre having your
fun with a girl and it was worth a broken
bone or two to interrupt you without
reason why-
  you loose-tongued lecher
  and i told him i lost my starboard
eye crack-peeping to witness your
secret interviews with kings and queens
im all that in your confidence these
lads confirmed it theyll make good
sailors time ive schooled em one way
and another and what with threatening
to drown him if he didnt he talked
chronos he talked of herod of jeru-
salem and this queens father and a
lady by name of boidion and half the
history of egypt
  seems that this queens father was a
bit of what youre fond of calling me
and hed a gift for getting daughters
had king ptolemy the piper nearly
all his get were daughters the boys
were sickly but the girls were well loined
and good lookers and any number of
em one she-child-one of his bastards
-was by a jewess name of esther i
think he said and they called the child
boidion
  that particular she-child is the spit-
ting image so said this man when hed
had his second cup of chian of that
princess arsinoe who got us into all that
trouble off salamis-born within the
same month and so like her said he
it was awkward
  but instead of poisoning her along
with her mother as would have been
more usual somebody whose job it was
to clean up king ptolemys leavings re-
ported em dead and packed em off to
jerusalem where the mothers folks
lived and our lads here claim they knew
the mother in jerusalem
  they swear she was a high-priests
daughter ive schooled em with a ropes
end so they dont lie to me worth men-
tioning they claim they knew boidion
too they say she grew up to be a fine
up-standing wench with saucy manners
and they agree she looks like queen
arsinoe of cyprus
the ten jews nodded one by
one solemnly resting on their
oars as tros looked at them
for confirmation of the story
well said conops this here aris-
tobolus said if i understood him right
that that swine of an etruscan tar-
quinius-only he called him a smart
fellow-who was left in cyprus in com-
mand of queen arsinoes body-guard
has killed arsinoe-dagger poison bow-
string drowned he didnt say what-
and crossed to syria and gone to jeru-
salem and found boidion and called
her arsinoe and brought her to egypt
and raised an army and intends to
march on alexandria and make her
queen of egypt
  i made him say it over and over
and i got it right thats his story
and he said that the thing for you to do
is to join boidion-he said near mem-
phis-because said he for two reasons
first queen cleopatra has your name
on her list of suspects for the torturer
to examine second knowing this boid-
ion isnt arsinoe soon as youve helped
to make her queen youll have the pick
of whatevers going and if youre so
minded you can even marry her and
make yourself viceroy or youll tell what
you know there master he said plenty
more but thats all i remember
  why did you gag him again
  i had to take the sail off him master
if id let him go on talking hed have
had me that mixed up id never have
remembered half of what i do remember
and besides there were two boats full

adventure
o queens men and i saw them search
a boat or two and they might have
searched us so i readied him up we
lashed the iron killick to his feet wed
have dumped him if the queens men
came close no knowing what might
have happened if theyd found him
aboard of us and us your men in a boat
that wed have had to do some full gale
lying to explain
  one of these days said tros youll
be a valuable man
  that was high praise conops pon-
dered it in silence and tros sat thinking
until mist and darkness blended and
suddenly the guard at the mouth of the
cross-city canal challenged gruffly tros
answered
  junior court chamberlain alexis
boat on the queens business
  some one stuck a torch into a fire-pot
and whirled it until five guards stood
revealed with the crimson firelight
gleaming on polished armor
 junior court chamberlain alexis
came ashore in the queens barge who
are you
 ask him who tells the queens
business to the first fool who asks
come closer row in here to the
wharf
at your own risk halt me at your
peril ive a prisoner for the dungeon
oh well-hell have company
theyve been packing them in pass
chapter vi
the fly-by-night flotilla
nightmare the slums of
rhakotis by crimson torch-
light the great trireme high
on the ways with her gilded
serpent draped in paulin thrust between
the roofs of storage sheds there were
men beneath her examining the torn tin
sheathing by the light of tow flares a
stream of esias slaves under the watch-
ful eyes of two of esias partners carry-
ing ashore the gear ammunitioa and
dunnage and tros personnel possessions
to be locked out of reach of longshore
thieves old esia with his hand on the
master-shipwrights shoulder listening
to tros and nodding as he watched the
secretary-slave jot down instructions
  strip off all the tin esias test every
nail in the hull theyre mostly oak
tree-nails and tight but some of them
may have been shorn from the shock of
collision we hit those pirate hulls with
our sails full o wind and a big sea
running we have had to work double-
shifts at the water-hoist all the way from
tarsus have your shipwright test every
inch of her timbers if theres anything
soft out with it anything cracked out
with it replace with lebanon cedar
theres a lot of that tin too badly torn
to be put back have it melted down
and rebeaten watch it though its
worth nearly its weight in silver
  now then ill be taking r hundred
men the remainder ill leave in your
charge dribble out their back pay
miserly the half theyve had already
will be gone by morning dole out the
balance fast enough to keep them from
thieving themselves into trouble but
slowlv enough to keep them standing
by
  lord captain i have the queens
ministers order not to repair your tri-
reme said esias i am already in
trouble for having done your business
selling your pearls to the queen for such
a high price has aroused the anger of
the treasury they-he-
  so you told me already did he order
you not to make ready to repair at full
speed when you get the word do as i
say esias
  i will risk that there was no order
not to make ready but a hundred-
of your men-before morning even
your lieutenant ahiram carouses himself
stupid
  ahiram shall stand by the ship
tros answered he is useless on land
cleopatras promise
now listen my prisoner aristobolus is
in your rope-shed under a guard of
your freedmen hold him there until i
come for him but drop a word in his
ear that i am perhaps more friendly to
him than i seem i need eight more
boats-good ones not too heavy set a
cask in each boat full of good drinking
water i need wine and provisions for
one hundred and twenty men for ten
days-sails and gear for each boat-
tow-line-plenty of spare rope-blankets
-the fools are afraid to sleep without
their heads covered-fire-pots-throw in
a bolt or two of bandage-linen therell
be broken heads to mend-enough cut
firewood for a few days cooking-better
put your slaves to work on that this
minute-one hundred and fourteen
horse-tail fly-switches-i want men fit to
fight not blown meat-and an open
letter of credit from you to all your
agents up the nile
  and all this before morning lord
captain
  before midnight esias
  impossible
  esias did i save your corn from the
pirates did i sell it to the romans for
its full value that too was impossible
but have you had your money for the
corn
  lord tros-
  may god guide your efforts esias
  lord tros-a moment
  esias a bit feeble with age and shaken
by excitement took his arm and walked
beside him
  this way this way
  he led into the deepest shadow be-
tween piles of ships stores
  take this it came from pelusium
nay i know not how my agent got it
there were two letters one from tar-
quinius so openly delivered that the
queens spies could not help but know
about it they came and took it and this
one that my agent sent stitched in a
saddle-girth see-the seal is unbroken
do you know from whom it is
 nay nay i guess i do not wish to
know tell none that i gave it to you
esias hesitated
 and tros asked him there was
speech on your lips esias
 beware of the lord alexis
  aye i will well beware of him
esias hurried away tros climbed the
ships side and entered his cabin that
had already been stripped of nearly all
its contents the whale-oil lamp still
burned by its light he examined the
letter it was of folded parchment soiled
with horse-sweat addressed in fine greek
characters to tros of samothrace he
felt a curious excitement he smelt and
felt the letter half a dozen times before
he broke the wax sealed with a thumb-
print and read it it was written in
greek in the same fine educated hand
   should you hear of my being in egypt
  doubt not should you hear of my dying in
  egypt doubt that unless they say i died in
  armor you will know whose armor i am
  altogether weary of being a stake on the board
  in a game played by fools and swindlers but
  again they throw the loaded dice so it is i
  who must fight for myself since there is none
  other for whom the fight is worth the effort
  you not having deigned to-
 several words had been crossed out
horse-sweat had made the correction
illegible
    -so if i am to die now farewell and for-
  get me but if i live you shall judge again
 there was no signature but there
could be no possible doubt in tros mind
of the writers name arsinoe had not
returned the armor that she wore in the
sea-fight off salamis her reference to
the armor was identification enough
 tros swore he set his teeth he
burned the letter in the flame of the
whale-oil lamp and trod the ashes of
the parchment into powder two rev-
olutions arsinoe in egypt boidion in
egypt as like as twins-as desperate
as hunted felons-as determined as the

adventure
queen herself to possess the throne and
as careless of others danger there was
no time now to think about it more
important at the moment were the
northmens battle-axes and their armor
he went and watched them wrapped up
ready and then action
  he marched away into the night in
armor because dark rhakotis was as
full of daggers as mongrel dogs his ten-
jew bodyguard trudged at his back
conops strode beside him wise in all
the by-ways familiar with every bawdy-
house and tavern from wharf-side to city
wall and from the wall to the slums
beyond it amid the slaughter-yards
slave-barracks native egyptian mud-
brick huts and factories along the road
to the necropolis
  first they entered a tavern called the
house of carousal that twanged with
zither-music and swished with the ex-
citing hiss of shaken sistra in a reek
of wine-fumes brown black white
ivory-hued bodies wove in and out in
the reddened smoke of unglazed lamps
and torches set in sconces on painted
walls bare feet thumped on the tiled
floor song-it was a sentimental stupid
new-fangled chorus about the blue-eyed
girls of gaul-shrilled from the throats
of wenches who sat on the customers
knees and kept them plied with wine
  it was a deep-sea sailors heaven
rigidly exclusive no one of less than
quarter-deck rank might enter and be
robbed in that place the proprietor
and four half-naked bullies hurried to
the door to protest against the presence
of the jews who were obviously of in-
ferior rank and moreover armed which
was against law and custom
  conops hit one of the bullies on his
spare-rib with the hilt of his knife-
sent him spinning-howling-doubled
with pain there was an instant uproar
the musicians tried to out-din the
tumult
  tros spied ahiram the phoenician
in gold ear-rings with a silken scarf tied
on his head and a girl on each knee
looked frightened he moved like a
man in a dream but he showed his teeth
when tros shook off a dozen dancing-
girls who tried to cling to his arms and
to pull off his armor and persuade him
to stay and be entertained tros came
and stood in front of him ahiram forgot
his manners
  teeth of a yellow cur am i your
watch-dog-day in day out-a-sea and
ashore did i come alive out of gale
and battle to be robbed of a bit of
wenching
  you have until midnight ahiram to
go and stand by the ship if esias re-
ports you absent at midnight i will order
him to pay you off
  ahiram came to his senses a bit
gradually he pushed the women off his
knees
  whats in the wind lord captain
treason if they fire the trireme in
my absence i will blame you ahiram
you are going somewhere
  aye which are you-lieutenant or
louse do i leave a man behind me
aye aye lord captain
grumbling ahiram began
there and then the tedious
business of disputing the
amount of his bill two or three
hours carousing would only have made
the return to duty all the harder to face
so he smote the protesting wenches tros
left him arguing how much he owed he
flung a coin to the proprietor who cursed
him as he went out
  the next place was a stews where
lesser notables foregathered decurions
stewards master-archers helmsmen
boatswains armorers ship-carpenters
and oar-bank overseers could count on
revelry uncriticized by the lords of the
quarterdeck the prices were slightly
lower the pace was faster for that reason
the wine stank worse the musicians
were fewer and made more noise the
women were older less comely and more
cleopatras promise

artless except for a big black galla
woman who was doing a dance in mid-
room
  she recognized conops instantly
ceased dancing shouted like an amazon
and rushed straight at him he sent her
sprawling and she lay beneath a service
table screaming that he owed her money
  but tros had come there for dccurions
he set his ten jews at the door and
stared through the lamp-smoke conning
faces selecting the men who had stood
best to their battle stations and whose
squads had shown best discipline in
filthy weather against almost over-
whelming odds some of the best men
were already too drunk to bother with
and some were sufficiently drunk to be
dangerous but one man came and asked
what it was the lord captain needed
 you tros answered you and
conops go and roust out these nine he
named the nine he had selected line
them in front of me
  it took priceless time they had to be
wrenched away from screaming harpies
who were egged on by the owner of the
place to drag their customers by force
into a labyrinth of cells out of sight in
the rear of the building
  but there were presently ten dishev-
eled revelers standing bewildered in mid-
room and even the proprietor ceased his
protests as tros looked them over the
music ceased
  are you men loyal
  aye aye lord captain
  they were hiccoughing some of them
swayed and one was bleeding from a
torn ear where a woman had tried to
wrench him loose from conops grip
are you seeking a new captain
no they were clear on that point
are you men or monkeys are you
comrades in arms or are you toss-pots
fit for nothing
men lord captain they were
indignant they had earned that title
blood and bread you know us but-
you but me those of you who
love your comfort more than duty fall
out fall out i say the remainder-
those of you who like the right to call
me captain-
  conops gave tongue he could bark
like the crack of breaking timbers
  ten-shun right turn quick
march left left left left wheel
to the street now try to march like
fighting men you dock-side drunkards
fall in my squad snap to it two
deep guard our backs you jews
havent had your pay yet i can trust
you left there left left cloak eh
leave it buy yourself another with
the loot of egypt
  the proprietor stormed cursed tore
his hair threw his garland at tros and
cited the law he threatened to summon
the city guards and have tros punished
for infraction of privilege no one in
alexandria except the queens police
had the right to interfere with any ones
pleasures provided he paid his score
and even the police were on the side of
the keepers of stews but tros was at
war with time each squandered minute
was a notch in the score against him
  take your bill to esias if its fair
i will bid him pay it
  he strode out filling his lungs with
cleaner air halted his men in the street
formed them in solid squad and gave his
orders
  each of you decurions is to pick ten
men from your own squad or another
decurions no matter which but strong
and willing fit to pull on an oar march
and fight with sword or bow and arrow
therell be rough work now and later
but double pay for all hands on this
expedition theres no time to go and
get your weapons but youll each have
one armed man to protect you so let
me see you wade in and line up a hundred
men in short order help yourselves to
clubs if you can find them-break some
furniture-dont be afraid to break the
heads of the brothel bullies

adventure
  expedition lord captain well
need-
  forward by the right quick march
  he led them sobering up in the night
air through the torch-lit dimness of the
shadowy rhakotis slums to the western
gate where the queens guards made no
difficulty the gate was not closed
alexandria was an open port of refuge
day or night for almost any one-even
for runaway slaves who were willing to
sell themselves to new masters or to
enlist in the riffraff army that was one
of the thousand excuses that rome had
for picking a quarrel
  tros in armor with a squad of twenty
behind him looked too much like a
queens man to be questioned even if
he was not recognized which he possibly
was he was not sure alexis was some-
where spreading rumors giving secret
orders there was no guessing what
alexis had said or done since he went
and fetched esias
  tros marched through the gate and
said nothing saluted no one was saluted
by none the gate clanged at his back
but recoiled ajar and the cumbrous beam
used as a lock was left leaning against
the wall
  then a raid such a raid as alexandria
had seen a thousand times when crews
were needed for the royal ships or por-
ters for the armys baggage loads on
the road to pelusium swift drastic
unexplained merciless-knives in the
dark like hornets stings-a panic-sav-
age raided mud-nest-torch-lit riot-
smashed doors-drunken seamen hauled
out of stinking dives and clubbed into
dazed obedience-roared at deep-sea
fashion-their anger adroitly exploited
turned against the brothel-keepers-
against yelping hags-against slaughter-
house butchers and riffraff roman desti-
tutes who ran to the brothel-proprietors
aid-until they roared at last half-con-
sciously their old familiar war-cry
  tros tros
 oarsmen - archers - swordsmen -
spearmen-bruised and bleeding but
beginning to be conscious of the deep-
sea brotherhood that owned them in one
discipline-unarmed but beginning to
feel again like fighting men-were hurled
kicked clubbed driven into the street
where tros stood with his armor crim-
soned by a torch that conops had
snatched from some one and then sud-
denly tros battle-voice
  stand by for trouble fall in all

  tros bull-lunged
  ships company fours-right by
the right quick march
  staggering reeling cursing fours the

  and then suddenly song-one voice
hoarse and drunken-two-ten-twenty

but in time to the steadier thud of feet
the indecorous boisterous song about
how the seamen taught directness to the
lord of gods and men-salty seamen

  western gate flung wide to admit the
procession-no questions asked but a
glimpse of alexis junior court chamber-
lain in conversation with the captain

cleopatras promise

was always a riot in rhakotis day or
night when anything dynamic happened
  curious excited credulous of any
rumor torch-lit streams of men and
women flowed down the shadowy streets
to esias wharf and fought there for the
right to be next to the palings-blocked
the way and fought the gangs of slaves
and sailors who carried the loads to the
boats at the canal wharf-yelled ques-
tions-lied-and at last jeered tros
because somebody said he was under
arrest and being sent by the queen into
southern egypt or perhaps to berenice
on the red sea
chapter vii
never again to speak of boidion
             est the only hardship
jsjreeh was the flies a sailors skin
is toughened to resist such
cleanly and natural elements
as ropes ends hail the twist of tight-
caught oars there are no flies at sea
and a hoarse-tail fly-switch is a unsea-
manly device with which to comfort the
lips and eyes of honest oarsmen
  but there was not much rowing they
lay flicking themselves and wondering
what monstrous dangers lay to south-
ward lions they had seen in the park
cages in alexandria and on ship-board
a fierce last word with conops-and
away two hours after midnight
  conops golden trumpet blew the cast
off and the oars shoved the boats into
mid-canal then tros voice over-roar-
ing all the tumult of the dinning crowd
flotilla-in line ahead-ready dip
silent except for the thump of oars
the boats stole southward threading a
torch-lit marble city toward mareotis
and the nile and the mysterious land
of khem
  full loads at last and a roll-call angry
protests from seamen too badly bruised
or broken-headed to be useful weapons
armor inspection two or three more
thrown out for looking slack in the ranks
and unfit for duty quick work by the
doctor-there was hardly a man without
a bandage assignment of places in the
boats each boat and each thwart num-
bered and each man numbered to a
thwart
  aristobolus with his hands tied and
his head in a wheat-sack lowered into
the second boat in charge of conops
alexis looking like a lost exquisite
sweating and rather soiled but philo-
sophically cheerful jumping into tros
place in the leading boat-rebuked for
it by three jews and three seamen who
came near throwing him overboard a
last word with esias and sleepy ahiram

adventure
on the way to rome and crocodiles and
even one hippopotamus
  but there were stories of serpents a
half-mile long that swallowed ships at
a gulp of a land of perpetual night in-
habited by bats that sucked mens life-
blood of ogres that lived in sepulchres
and of two-headed women with one
breast apiece who could drive an arrow
through the stoutest armor and who ate
mens entrails
  true lord captain tros had been
right as usual there was a north wind
the canal from maretois to the nile
had been dug by a ptolemys engineers
so oriented as to make a soldiers breeze
eight or nine months in the year for the
laden barges the lord captain had
promised the wind would blow them up
the river and he might be right again
but they had heard stories of whirlpools
rapids cataracts and of many a ship
that sailed up-nile but had never come
home again
  it made no difference to men recover-
ing from drink and totally ignorant of
their destination or the purpose of the
expedition that they kept continually
passing laden barges all from the south
  the south was an ominous mystery
their heads ached they made very
little conversation and kept the flotilla
closely enough spaced to satisfy even
the lord captains demands
  it was nearly low-nile and the current
was sluggish when the wind failed at
bends of the river or in the lee of culti-
vated islands the rowing was not par-
ticularly hard work but it was mostly
sailing and at night-fall when tros
called a halt at the site of a very ruinous
temple there was less than fifteen
minutes between the leading and the
last boat and every one was cheerful
except aristobolus whose hands were
no longer bound but who had spent
nearly sixteen hours in conops company
  he looked by that time as if he might
prefer to be talked to by sepulchral
ghouls or devils from the world beyond
the sources of the nile
  the nile was main street they were
passing through the richest and most
densely populated cultivated zone on
earth where there were villages every
few miles and even the reeds were har-
vested for fuel there was a continual
stream of north-bound traffic the only
reason why they had that reedy bivouac
to themselves was because the spirits
of the ancient dead were said to haunt
the place
  the evening wind in the reeds the
rustling of the night-fowl and the eerie
darkness of egyptian night combined to
create terror there were hermits like
huge owls in the ruins two of them
were bald scrawny old females-speech-
lessly piously lousy
  the men refused to sleep ashore they
ate their meal in a hurry in silence and
piled back into the boats they implored
tros not to risk his life in the ruined
temple precincts but he ordered conops
and a squad to sweep the fleas and bat-
filth from a stone-paved chamber and
there he lit a fire and invited aristobolus
and alexis
  the two alexandrines eyed each other
with alert suspicion they ate in silence
except when alexis complained of his
lack of a servant to wash him and bring
him a change of linen if he had no other
reason he had been too lazy to unpack
his enormous roll of bedding and be-
longings they omitted to drink to each
other even when tros poured the wine
and made a hospitable gesture to them
both
  however alexis had been in the lead-
ing boat tros had talked to him he
was well primed-knew what was ex-
pected of him so as soon as the meal
was finished tros went out to wash
himself and to post sentries and make
sure that the boats were well moored he
took plenty of time about it and when
he returned the two men appeared to be
cleopatras promise

not exactly friendly but to have reached
some sort of understanding
  look here said aristobolus your
man conops has been telling me all day
long that youre at logger-heads with the
queen-that you only escaped death by
jumping off the royal barge and swim-
ming that confirms what i told him to
tell you-that you are on the proscrip-
tion list am i right
  i had a narrower escape from four
of your freedmen tros answered
  so what happened
  what will happen to you also unless
you obey me-in thought speech action
and in the very manner of your gestures
i will presently say what i wish you to
do and i will split you like a fish if you
refuse to do it that is not a threat it
is a statement of fact
  aristobolus digested the information
then continued
  your man conops told me-he said
it twenty times or oftener-that you
intend to throw in your lot with those
of us who look for a change on the
throne
  conops is in my confidence tros
answered
  alexis says he has the same inten-
tion
  and you tros asked him
sacrament of isis i ran a thousand
risks yesterday morning didnt i to
warn you of the danger you were in and
to implore you to join boidion
  you said arsinoe
  i know it was there time in the
street with the queens spies every-
where to tell you all the details of a plot
that has taken us weeks to contrive
after months of study man be reason-
able and consider now how you have
treated me
i saved you from the queens men
tros answered i was asked where you
are i could only reply that i had slain
your freedmen who attacked me
that puts another complexion on it
but not on my demands on you
tros answered you tried to trap me-
for your own good to take you to
boidion
  that failing you tried to have me
murdered
 why not i mistrusted you how
should i know you wouldnt turn my
name in to the queens police
 you know now you have told my
man conops the story of boidion and
conops has told me has our friend
alexis heard it tell him
  yes said alexis he told me when
you just now left us alone to digest that
vultures food that you adorned with the
magical title of supper
  what did you think of it tros
asked
  garbage army contract garbage
during the past year i have had all my
meals at the royal table could anybody
but a sailor ask me what i think of
that stuff
  belly i spoke of boidion
  oh her well boidion has the ad-
vantage from our viewpoint that she
has never been queen of egypt whereas
arsinoe has been arsinoe it is true
didnt last long caesar to use his own
phrase readjusted her condition to
comply with custom and the law of
egypt damned old humbug what was
he doing in egypt however arsinoe
had time to learn more than a little
and when they know too much theyre
difficult
  witness our present queen its a mis-
take to try to win races with beaten
horses-probably an even worse mistake
to bet on a defeated queen to win a
revolution that is why hitherto i have
set my face against arsinoe and have
continued to be what is known as loyal
but boidion who is said to resemble
arsinoe so closely that they look like
each others reflection in a mirror might
be-i say might be-a shrewd mans
venture anyway what choice have you
or aristobolus with your names on the
queens list

adventure
  you already know my mind tros
answered and they nodded they be-
lieved they understood him i propose
that we three shall take oath tonight
together never again to speak of boi-
dion but of queen arsinoe
  he filled the wine-cups groping for
them by the light of the dying embers
  queen arsinoe of egypt said aris-
tobolus drinking i swear to that by
zeus and by the holy sacrament i
swear to live or die by queen arsinoe
of egypt
  queen arsinoe said alexis wry-
faced because the wine was the stuff
that esias sold to deep-sea captains i
am superstitious i dont like to take
oaths about dying death is a damned
unpleasant event that will occur too
soon no matter when
  it was tros turn by my own good
name and for my souls sake and for
the sake of egypt i will do my best
for queen arsinoe
  you talk like a shaveling priest you
stormy war-horse said alexis soul
how much for it if i could lay hands
on my own i would sell it for one night
of joyous living
  aye added aristobolus and you
would sell it for the sake of your hair
and hide the queens torturers will
attend to us three if we fail it seems
to me we can trust one another what
now
  do you know where to find her
tros asked
  aristobolus perceived his value
  do i is it likely i would go to all
that trouble to persuade you if i
couldnt go straight to her hiding place
then you shall go said tros and
you shall take alexis with you you
shall say i come with all possible haste
with a hundred men
you astonish me even more than
him remarked alexis do you always
go in for astonishing people i think we
should stick together suppose i refuse
it would be pleasanter said tros
than being torn to pieces in the queens
dungeon but to die for disobedience
has always seemed to me a miserable
death
  alexis sounded as if he swallowed
something he made no other comment
  we are to go on ahead of you aris-
tobolus asked how then will you find
us we are likely to be difficult to fol-
low there are no streets in the desert
and he added slowly we should not
feel-shall i call it fortunate-if you
should turn aside or retreat and leave
us trying to explain to desperate ven-
turers why we have brought them false
news what guarantee do you offer
what pledge
  conops
tros quarterdeck voice star-
tled the owls awoke wild-fowl
in the reeds and brought even
a hermit peering at him over
the edge of a broken comice alexis
threw a lump of broken masonry at the
hermit and helped himself to the sour
wine with a shrug of resignation he
rubbed his face with the stuff to allay
the irritation of fly-and mosquito-bites
conops appeared at a sign from tros
he squatted his one eye as bright as a
cats in the glow from the embers
  choose the eight best rowers from
the whole flotilla conops you may
also have two of the jews-your own
choice take these noblemen up-river
at the fastest speed you can make you
are to eat and sleep by watches speed
is the main thing set both noblemen
ashore with a days provisions wher-
ever the lord aristobolus says is his
destination wait there for me hide if
you can but keep a good lookout
aye aye master
  when asked aristobolus
  now when you have reached your
objective you will send back somebody
to guide me after i have picked up
conops
  aristobolus objected
cleopatras promise

  tros there isnt any need for all this
strategy if we should have the luck
to get up-river without being inter-
cepted by the queens patrol there will
be more than a guide waiting for us i
can faithfully assure you some one in
alexandria must have talked and far
too many of us have been caught in the
queens net but do you suppose we have
been such clowns as not to arrange a
good line of communication once were
beyond the delta there isnt a living
human being who isnt on our side
they wait for nothing but enough armed
men to strike a quick blow at memphis
victory will lead to victory the queens
troops will all come over to our side if
we win one battle
  very likely said tros but you
will do as i tell you go and choose
your rowers conops
  tros said alexis calmly youre a
vile commander of an expedition you
begin by offending all the prejudices of
the men on whom you must depend
do i depend on you-or you on me
or do we all depend on obedience
tros retorted criticize me later when
you know what i know and when you
see what i do
  criticize me now tros i would like
to hear you
  no the queen has done that she
instructed me to trust you that is
why i send you forward
  i will go i cant refuse you said
alexis but he sounded less unwilling
than his words implied
  tros nodded he went outside and
had private word with conops he gave
secret orders and then presently ad-
vice
  mark my word little man the one
to keep your eye on is alexis he pre-
tends to be the queens man but he is
not aristobolus is a mere bungler who
can see no farther than his nose take
a look in alexis baggage while he
sleeps
  aye aye master
  it would do no harm if he should
think me as aristobolus thinks i am
disgusted with the queen are the north-
mens axes in my boat
  aye aye i have set them there in
place of the lord alexis dunnage
fifteen minutes later conops started
upstream-an oar-pulsed shadow on the
star-lit bosom of the river
  one hour later the flotilla followed
in the stern of the leading boat tros
slept at ease unworried he had laid
his bet on the board the outcome was
for destiny to unfold and if destiny
should call upon him for some odyssean
wit and herculean energy he had it
and would use it to the limit
  but he dreamed it was not normal
for tros to dream of women he
dreamed of a girl in armor

purple egyptian night
the rising full moon barely
beginning to silver the east-
ern sky absolute darkness in
among the reeds and almost utter si-
lence the winds whisper out-soughed
mens breathing the wide river a mir-
ror of stars an occasional clank of steel
as some ones weapon touched his neigh-
bors armor-an occasional thump of
boat against boat a hum of insects a
mud smell from the caked bank
  a hippopotamus blew in mid-river
and somewhere over on the far bank
half a mile away a lion roared melan-
choly-lonely the flotilla lay moored
to the reeds invisible straining to catch
conops words
  aye master i put em ashore about
five miles south o here at a temple it
looks mighty like a town theres a
fleet o boats there-some of em good
big ones five-and-thirty armed men-
looked like syrians to me in scraps of
old roman uniform and what not-

adventure
rushed to the pier the minute i hailed-
and the priests not taking notice any
number o priests id say i saw all
told about two hundred soldiers bi-
vouacked alongside a high white wall
that comes pretty near down to the
river four men whipped the lord
alexis luggage out of the boat id
looked there wasnt much more in it
master than enough fine clothes to keep
him looking ship-shape for a year id
say maybe longer and perhaps some
money in a big leather bag inside his
bed-linen he doesnt believe youre a
rebel but aristobolus does its my be-
lief alexis means to set an ambush for
us i and the crew were bidden welcome
but i backed away to save argument
and came on down-stream same as you
said that was yesterday morning and
the lads about all in theres a gaul so
blistered hell be no use for two or three
days
  weve enough blistered men to stand
by the boats go ahead what did you
find out
  i scouted all yesterday afternoon
and all today yonder master-you
cant see em from here-four or five
miles from here to there across corn
land but the corns all been harvested-
are the pyramids and the sphynx
tombs too-thousands of em id say
theres a school o mummies all laid
out like fish to dry theyre stripping
em i guess for jewelry
  there are three sets of buildings set
in a triangle wide apart theres a mud-
and-straw barrack near a well in a hol-
low with maybe three or four hundred
laborers but theyre nothing-neednt
reckon with em-they eat whip like
donkeys near by them is a better built
barrack full o soldiers queens men i
reckon as shabby as rhakotis beggars
but well armed theyre a mixed lot
with greek officers-id say about two
hundred men with their officers horsed
on little bits o nags that eat date-straw
i saw em do it
  where are our northmen
  master im laying it out the way i
conned it let me pay the rope out end-
first or ill get it snarled i left the lads
here i went yonder and climbed a pyra-
mid theres three big ones and several
smaller the biggests as big as a moun-
tain you cant climb that one its all
smooth white stone-steep as our
shrouds pretty near and no foothold
but some of the casing of the next big-
gest is broken so that ones easy but
its hotter up there than a spitted kid-
ney it was too hot for flies but there
were scorpions
  i was stung twice-found a gypsy
woman later and she gave me breast-
milk to put on the bites so i wouldnt
bite myself to death the way ive heard
happens i had a good view from up
near the top between the two biggest
pyramids corner to corner there are
two long mud-brick walls and theyre
patrolled at night by soldiers liside
that space theres a four-walled enclos-
ure of mud-brick
  inside that is the smallest o the three
sets of buildings-a barrack o some sort
and its there i think they berth our
northmen and i think they chain em
nights but im not dead sure o that
either it was after sunset when i
counted seemed to me eight-and-thirty
fellows pretty well tuckered being
herded out of a hole in the ground-
maybe a tomb-toward that place i just
told you by the time i was down off
the pyramid-its a long run around
from the rear and me as thirsty as a
salt fish-they were all inside the wall
and i couldnt get by the soldiers but i
thought i heard chains the walls
about two o my height and the gates
a boats deck-takes a dozen men to
shift it
  what then
  came back here for food and sleep
after supper rowed across the river
camp o black tents in a hollow near the
far bank and a lot o camels its all
cleopatras promise

desert to eastward but theres reeds and
there were two boats in the reeds just
on general principles i tried to steal the
boats but theyd a watch set and one
of our lads got a cut on the arm-the
left arm-nothing serious so i came
back and before sunrise i was off again
scouting i tried listening at the sol-
diers barracks but i didnt dare get
caught or youd ha lacked information
and besides i thought id time enough
-didnt expect you until tomorrow
night master you must ha come like
holy hermes
 so what
  up-river as i told you theres a
temple and about a couple o hundred
armed men-maybe more with aris-
tobolus and alexis and i dont know
who else from the temple theres a
road that leads to memphis you can
see the roofs of memphis its a big
city theres another road between the
pyramids and memphis but no traffic
all day long not a sign of a living man
on both roads but over yonder by the
pyramids theyre digging out mummies
by the dozen if our northmen are
there i couldnt swear to it i didnt
see em they were down in a hole in
the ground before i got there and it
was dark before they let em out so i
came back
  and
  master im not lying im a dol-
phins uncle if i didnt jump slap in the
lap o that princess arsinoe-her that
we left behind in cyprus she was sit-
ting down here talking free and easy
to the boats crew and them telling her
who they are and where they come
from and where you are i jumped
from the top of the bank being scared
o snakes and fell right over her i
rolled off quick id seen her dagger a
man in the fight off salamis she knew
me in a minute-called me by name
  was she alone
 no two boat-loads o men i
counted ten in one boat the other boat
was down-stream a way in the reeds
and i couldnt see how many the men
i did see were some o the pirates we
took prisoner and you gave to her in

adventure
salamis the boats were the same wed
tried to make away with from the far
bank
 men armed
  to the teeth
  how long ago was that
  two hours-maybe two hours and a
half
  the moon rose bathing the land in
silver streaked with shadows the river
began to look like molten metal
  what did she say
  nothing barring telling me i stink
worse than if id been buried a week
she said never a word seems id hurt
her instep she was spitting mad for a
couple o minutes then she laughed
then she up and went walking with a
man behind her carrying that suit of
armor we lent her and never got back
which way
  the way id come-toward the pyra-
mids across the belt of com land her
men followed-maybe twenty all told
and
  i scuttled both her boats theyd set
no boat watch
  no sign of the lord alexis
  no nor of aristobolus
  tros cursed the moon then pres-
ently he blessed it he climbed the
bank and made his way to high ground
the whole landscape was bathed in pale
white light streaked with dark shad-
ows of ridges that lay like watercourses
roughly south and north but there was
one wide shadow that curved northwest-
ward until it reached the great pyramid
and seemed to pour into a pool of ink
beyond
  one pyramid looked black another
gray but the great one gleamed like
marble he could see the lights of mem-
phis-very few scattered apart there
was a dark line that was likely a mud-
brick wall and he could count six watch-
fires probably there were others down
in the dunes but all egypt had to be
thrifty of fuel it looked like a long
way to memphis and the land looked
as dead as the bones of death itself and
deathly quiet
      suddenly he saw what
made him bless the moon
there were men on the march
-southward-away from the
pyramids-not along the road to mem-
phis but toward what appeared to be
low ground with what might be the roof
of a building barely visible about mid-
way between memphis and the nile
even with a seamans eyes it was very
difficult to judge direction or distance
and it was impossible to count the
marching men because of the shadows
they cast but they might be a couple of
hundred a few more or a few less with
officers on little bits of horses they ap-
peared to have no baggage-train
  was arsinoe with them if so what
of boidion was the boidion story a
mares nest or had conops mistaken
boidion for arsinoe tarquinius the
etruscan might easily have given ar-
sinoes armor to boidion and might eas-
ily have informed her well enough to
call conops by name according to
couops the girl had said very little-
perhaps from fear of self-betrayal she
had gone away in the direction of the
pyramids it might be-it looked like
it-she probably was leading or being
led to unite with the forces from the
temple up-river for a march on mem-
phis four or five hundred men might
easily take memphis there would only
be police and perhaps a few officers and
a rabble of impressed hurriedly armed
citizens to be overwhelmed
  were the northmen with her very
likely they would certainly prefer the
prospect of plundering memphis to the
dreary unpaid task of mining through
the sand for the loot for some one else
from ancient tombs surely they would
rather fight any one anywhere than toil
under the whips of egyptian overseers
  tros made his decision
  conops take your boat up-river
cleopatras promise

and set fire to their shipping scuttle
and burn
  aye aye master what then
return down-stream and follow me
im going to march toward the pyramids
and make a demonstration in the rear
of those soldiers i intend to burn their
barracks ge going ill attend to the
landing party
  aye aye master
  conops vanished up-stream with a
boat-load of dry reeds and a very care-
fully tended earthen fire-pot tros or-
dered his men ashore selected the badly
blistered ones to stand by the boats dis-
tributed the northmens battle-axes and
armor and was on the march almost
before the thump of conops oars had
died away around the bend of the river
  it was after midnight-the shadows
shortening-so he had to make haste
he wasted  time avoiding egyptian
huts that looked and stank like hog-
pens where the peasantry lay silent
quaking in dread of forced porterage
and all other incidences to the march of
armed men
  no stragglers the weird moonlight
stirred superstition they marched in
terror in close order wondering that
tros should dare to lead toward such
monstrous mysterious things as pyra-
mids from which they expected to see
devils come forth word went down the
line in whispers that the column they
could see in the distance on their left
front was fleeing from the ghosts of the
ancient dead they had heard conops
tale of the mummies lying stripped and
desecrated so they crowded one an-
others heels
  it was cool so the weight of their ar-
mor was impediment they marched
swiftly but though they marched in
shadow in the lee of a long ridge on
dusty earth that smothered sound the
moon shone on their helmets and tros
did not know whether they had been
seen or not when at the end of an hour
and a half he halted them within the
awful shadow of the great pyramids
western side
  he advanced alone forth from the
shadow until he could see past the pyra-
mid in the direction of the nile and
twice he almost fell into an open tomb
the horizon blazed smoky crimson
conops had succeeded a whole fleet of
boats was burning tros returned to
his men but he couldnt get volunteers
to cross the moonlit waste of sand and
set fire to the soldiers barracks they
were overawed by the monstrous pyra-
mid that loomed and seemed to lean
against the starry sky he had to pick
a dozen men and lead them himself
  he fired the roof-thatch with his own
hand then as the dry stuff caught and
roared skyward all the laborers stam-
peded from the other barrack-fled like
ghosts scattering he had to go alone
to fire those other roofs his men were
willing to fight lions or even dragons
but not phantoms
  but when they saw him stand alone in
the glare of the blazing thatch they were
ashamed and approached him he
pointed up-nile to the glare of the burn-
ing boats where conops had done his
duty
  so now i have served my challenge
on the lord alexis he can march on
memphis if he pleases but i think he
will first come here to slay me and per-
haps to try to win you to his side against
the queen of egypt
  we are few lord captain we arc
very few indeed to fight a battle said
some one
  shall i fight alone tros answered
  nay nay
  then obey me
  whether or not alexis was a traitor to
the queen-and tros had small doubt
on that point whether or not alexis was
in control or could make his advice pre-
vail it was an absolute certainty that
the rebels now knew they had tros and
a hundred men to deal with at their
rear before they could dare to attack

adventure
memphis if conops had burned all their
boats their retreat as an organized
force toward upper egypt was out of
the question at least for the time being
  irresolution might encourage mem-
phis to attack them whereas if they
should act swiftly and defeat tros that
would discourage memphis it might
even cause the immediate surrender of
the city-an initial success that would
probably bring over to their side whole
regiments of the queens corrupt and
discontented army from the red sea
ports and pelusium and from places
higher up the nile
there was almost no doubt
what the enemy would do
there being almost nothing
else that they could do but
there was plenty of time now it would
be hours before they could unite and
attack they might wait until daylight
they probably would
  no sign of arsinoe no sign of the
northmen the great wooden gate in
the mud-brick wall between the pyra-
mids that conops had described stood
wide open so did the gate in the inner
wall no guards no sentries half in
moonlight half in shadows the great
enclosure lay forlorn and silent
  too late tros muttered cursing
himself for having let the flotilla rest too
often on the way for the sake of arriv-
ing fit for action for a moment he was
almost irresolute-almost ready to re-
treat to the boats then he began to
consider a plan of battle and his eye
fell again on the long high mud-brick
wall that enclosed the space between the
two great pyramids
  if there was water in there it would
do and for the moment in any event
it would do to give his scared men a
sense of security he decided to return
to them and lead them into the enclos-
ure through the open gate with his
frightened squad behind him he crossed
the moonlit open ground and strode into
the gloom
  he almost jumped out of his armor
it took every scrap of iron self-control
he owned to stand still and not show
himself stunned with astonishment
hail hail hail
  tros tros tros
  eight-and-thirty battle-axes swung
aloftand trembled to the thrill of their
owners welcome seven-and-thirty
northmen bearded unkempt lean
stood in line behind sigurdsen their
leader all tros other men had broken
ranks they had become an almost in-
visible audience that crowded to see
what would happen they could see
tros face his feet were in shadow his
head in moonlight
  during six full seconds he stood rigid
with his hand at the salute
  i am glad he said then holding his
voice to the gruff unemotional note that
carries home the full weight of a mans
good faith and will
  then he went and shook hands with
sigurdsen who had ruled a tiny baltic
kingdom until the day when tros met
him in single combat and beat him to
his knees he was older than tros and
a full head taller he was sobbing
  tros punched him friendly fashion
and then walked along the line to shake
hands with each in turn until at the
end of the line he came to angsgar the
skald a shorter thick-set thoughtful
looking man tros laughed then
  gold-beater he said bracelet
maker
  aye lord captain a heavy brace-
let is a better weapon than a dagger on
a dark night
  it was dark until i set eyes on it
tros answered that was good work
angsgar
  he returned to his place in front of
them and stood staring there was
some one else in armor out in front be-
side sigurdsen about six paces from
him on his right hand-perhaps even
slightly in front of sigurdsen-small as
compared to those northmen and
cleopatras promise

slight but very straight in armor
  whoever it was-and tros knew who
it was-had stood there from the first
but tros had chosen not to see he
knew what courtesy demanded even
common kindness but his quick wit
failed him he stood silent until the
moons rim rose above the pyramid and
moonlight shone on the crestless helmet
and the pale girls face beneath then
he spoke
  who are you
  it seemed a senseless question but he
had chosen it from half a hundred oth-
ers that he might have asked-that he
would have liked to ask
  she answered in a good round fear-
less voice
  arsinoe the captain of your north-
men
  in the queen of egypts name i left
you in salamis queen of cyprus
  i prefer to command your north-
men
  you are my prisoner
  very well i have done as i pleased
you will do as you please
  kill her not if he knew it since his
baltic wife died on a beach in gaul he
had never seen a woman whom he liked
as he did this one but what could he
do with her how save her from cleo-
patras malice
  i gave you one chance he said to
die in battle
  she laughed did i refuse it-notice-
ably then try me again-lord cap-
tain
chapter ix
  did you think to win egypt with
  two dozen men
climax had broken the
spell of superstitious fear the
men rallied they obeyed
none needed to be told they
were in deadly danger but now it was
tangible and they understood it there
were no supplies no archer had more
than fifty arrows their line of retreat
to the boats could be cut and the boats
couid be seized or scuttled easily by a
mere raiding party
  they followed tros-first the north-
men then arsinoes four-and-twenty pi-
rates then the flotillas crew-in column
of fours into the walled enclosure but
there was no water in there even if they
could carry enough water the wall would
not be easy to defend
  every last man knew the case was
desperate some of them went to the
well and began hauling water into earth-
ern jars that the egyptians had left be-
hind
  tros selected ten seamen for outpost
duty and told all the others to lie down
and sleep he had decided to wait for
conops who might bring reliable infor-
mation he posted his sentries sta-
tioned the men with the sharpest eyes
a hundred feet up the flank of the pyra-
mid that conops had climbed and re-
turned for the inevitable drum-head
council he would have preferred to
postpone it but there was no avoiding
a talk with arsinoe as he knew from
the experience in cyprus she was capa-
ble of day-long silences but she was
also capable of forcing issues and he
didnt know what to say to her
  he wanted information from her with-
out being forced to reveal his own
thoughts or his own predicament he
could think of no other way than to
gain time and perhaps exhaust her pa-
tience by making her wait until he had
the northmens story
  most of the men were already sprawl-
ing on the sand but the northmen had
built a fire of broken baskets straw and
splinters chopped from the gate they
were squatting around it two deep
they had left a space for tros and a
box to sit on so he sat and faced sigurd-
sen
sigurdsen and angsgar the skald were
the only two who could talk greek flu-
ently and it was useless to expect a

adventure
plain tale from angsgar runes were al-
ready running in his mind he would
presently sing a story in which facts
would merely be the seeds of splendid
fiction
  angsgar was an artist-sigurdsen a
pessimist who battle-axed the truth to
lay bare gloom on which to base a mood
of melancholy discontent a loyal man
unhappy unless he had something to
grumble about
  it was a long box that they had laid
bottom upward arsinoe came and sat
beside tros she laid her helmet on the
box between them and her coppery-
golden hair fell loose on her shoulders
she sat with a sword between her knees
and said nothing to tros who did his
best to pretend she was not there
  and so now we all die said sigurd-
sen it is a bad end to be buried
among these mummies in a land where
no mans word is worth the breath he
uses but it is good that you came
tros we had given up hope of ever
seeing you until she came they told
us you had gone to sea and left us to
our fate we had to dig or die of hun-
ger and at night they chained us but
because we were chained the guards
grew careless and we were making a
plan for escape to the nile when her
man came from over-river and stole
through the dark spying
  he had word with us and when he
had learned whose men we are he told
of the fight off salamis and how you
had given your prisoners of whom he
was one to her and he said she needs
men who will fight to the death and
much more also he said we bade him
take back word to her that if we can we
will escape across the nile and he
went and we made a new plan
  so tonight when it was time to cease
work in the tomb and the commander
of the guards came and offered us free-
dom if we will march under his com-
mand in an assault on memphis we
drove him forth with our picks and shov-
  els so he summoned men and they tried
to kill us all but we were hard to come
at so they tried to bury us alive but
they let in not enough sand and we dug
our way out in darkness they were
marching away so we lay still
  then she came and she said she has
news of you and of your coming and
at that we became like men who are
drunk with strong drink so we ap-
pointed her captain being as i say as
men drunk
  but we hid because you came so
soon that we doubted it could be you
we crept near in the darkness and
while you were burning the barracks we
called some of the seamen by name and
they knew us and now you know all
saving what she told us let her tell it
though i die for it i will not said
arsinoe unless lord captain tros him-
self asks
  if it pleases you he said be silent
for the space of at least a minute
there was no other sound than bated
breathing then arsinoe spoke
  very well here is my sword do
you want my armor if you propose to
silence me forever cut my throat now
she stood up so did tros he was
raging with emotion that felt like anger
and as such he used it
  princess i left you in cyprus well
provided is it your idea of gratitude to
come and raise this-
  quite suddenly he realized he was not
angry it was another emotion less fa-
miliar less easy to govern
  but since you have come he said
be seated tell me
  she laughed they sat down again
side by side her laugh was rather dis-
concerting she had cleopatras gift of
seeing through a man and of understand-
ing his motives
  lord captain tros she said quietly
do you wish to be king of egypt
no he answered
  neither do i wish to be queen of
cleopatras promise

cyprus so perhaps we can understand
each other
  did you think to win egypt with
two dozen men he asked her
  i was queen of egypt once she an-
swered i am no longer a queen of
anywhere i do not wish to be one and
i will not even as you i am here to
prove my spirit and to die if need be
you have heard of boidion
  tros nodded she seemed to wish to
be questioned but he waited and pres-
ently she continued
  she is at that temple up-river she
has called herself arsinoe or has let
them call her so she believes me dead
-or did believe it that etruscan jackal
lars tarquinius whom you left to com-
mand my bodyguard-
  tros interrupted ahenobarbus did
it
  she laughed again delighted to have
tros on the defensive but he made no
further comment so she continued
  lars tarquinius who is such a
jackal that he would betray himself if
there were no one else to betray began
to speak to me of boidion before you
were gone an hour from salamis he
suggested to me that we should encour-
age boidion to make a raid on egypt
calling herself arsinoe and it was clear
that the plot had long been cooking i
was to lie low in hiding
  then should boidion succeed in rais-
ing a real rebellion i should hasten to
egypt and they would murder boidion
and set me on the throne but if boidion
should fail then i should come out of
hiding in cyprus and denounce her and
all would be well
  it was a very intelligent plot and he
proved to me that herod and even cas-
sius would lend aid but i said no to
it i care nothing for boidion why
should i but i would not trust tar-
quinius and since you and i talked in
salamis i had lost my craving to be
queen of egypt
  i should have died that night i sup-
pose because the plot was well forward
and tarquinius not to be balked but
his avarice saved me he believed he
could sell me to herod and the men
whom you had given me were all cap-
tured pirates who understood that busi-
ness so he told them they might have
me to take to delos where the slave-
merchant hipponax would know how to
get in communication with herod and
he furnished a boat in which they put
me at night with two women and we
set sail
  but they were my men it was my
task to prove it i did and it was not
so difficult for they had seen me fight
against them on your ship and they
were as weary of being pirates as i was
weary of being used as a pawn in a
game by scoundrels and cowards i
made them promise and i said i would
bring them to you if i could do it but
of course i did not dare to go to alex-
andria nor did i dare to write to you
any more than i did write for fear
cleopatra might lay her hands on the
letter and suspect you and have you
put to death i know my sister
  words you had said to me burned in
my mind i might have sent a letter to
expose the plot and thus i might even
have bought cleopatras friendship but
i had made up my mind what i want
and i knew it might not be had by be-
trayals and writing letters it was my
name they were misusing it was me
they should deal with it was i who
should do as you would do and play my
own hand against whatever odds des-
tiny sends i would deal face to face
with boidion and her masters who she
probably supposes are her servants
  so we came to pelusium pretending
to be a slave ship because the slavers
can come and go where it is unsafe for
any one else old esias avas at pelusium
tros whistled softly to him-
self careful esias had played
safe had he always on the
winning side esias and yet

adventure
never to be caught in an intrigue be-
cause he never did too much nor too
soon
  esias was awfully afraid but i sold
him the vessel and borrowed money
from him-quite a lot of money i was
almost caught in pelusium because i
paid my men and they got drunk but
esias hid me and sent his slaves to
round them up and it was from esias
that i learned how boidion had crossed
the desert and how the border patrol
had been bribed to know nothing about
it she had gone up the eastern branch
of the nile she and her party in a num-
ber of vessels that belong to the priests
and are not subject to search
  i bought equipment in pelusium-
black arabian tents and many other
things i and my two women and my
four-and-twenty men went up the nile
in laden barges to heliopolis it was
easy for my men to pretend they were
travelers on the way to arabia no one
questioned them and as for me and
my women we were wives of memphis
merchants on our way home i had
bought two men-slaves in pelusium at
a very high price because esias recom-
mended them so that we looked like
respectable women they are very good
slaves they have been spying for me
they brought me news of the arrival of
alexis and aristobolus and i knew then
it would not be long before they would
march on memphis
  do you know alexis tros asked
  no but tarquinius told me his
name as one who is in cleopatras con-
fidence but who is the actual first in-
ventor of the plot to make use of
boidion
  i was camped on the far bank as
i daresay conops told you i bought
camels they are there now conops
came to steal my boats i didnt know
it was conops-not then but as sig-
urdsen has told you one of my men
came spying here and brought back
word so i decided to come here at all
risks and to try to rescue these north-
men and perhaps also to win over some
of the soldiers i found conops boat
on this side of the river and the men
whom he had left to guard it talked like
children because they had seen me in
battle on your ship so i knew you were
coming and then conops nearly killed
me by accident and where the faith-
ful dog is his master is not far distant
oh-heh number one conops
cried a voice in outer darkness
oh-heh number two conops
oh-heh number three conops
silence hurrying staggering foot-
falls deadened by the sand then a
voice
  wheres master
  this way
  ten men reeled through the open gate
behind another who was bow-legged and
hardly higher than the others shoul-
ders then conops unmistakable voice
halt ten-shun fall out now and
get yourselves a drink then down the
hatch for a couple o snores and sleep
like dead men youll be needed at day-
break sure as death stand at ease
stand easy fall away
  he shoved himself a passage between
seated men and stood with his back to
the fire saluting tros but he couldnt
keep his one eye off the northmen it
danced sideways he was grinning
well what
  did it master it was easy they
were on the march already direction o
memphis nothing but a lot o lousy
priests to interfere with us so we burned
the pier too scuttled some boats
burned the others and stood by to be
sure they were caught good then we
cut the moorings o some and they
drifted into dry reeds by the bank lower
down youd ha thought all egypt was
burning it stopped em i reckon we
came back down-stream as fast as we
could make it and our boats were all
right with the watch awake from that
bit o high ground where you and i stood
cleopatras promise

conning i could see em in full moon-
light theyve met that column that we
saw marching southward and there
theyve all dropped anchor wondering
what next i reckon my boats crew are
used up master ive dismissed em
you may lie on my cloak and get
some sleep yourself tros answered
you have done well
  conops saluted and backed away al-
most into the fire he grinned all around
the circle
  thought i smelt herring well ive
smelt worse battle-axe me if here isnt
old top-mast himself alive and growling
natural hows odin
  tros interrupted
  manners you wharf-rat
  conops came and faced arsinoe he
straightened his face straightened the
knife at his belt put his hands to his
sides his heels together and bowed low
your obedient servant princess
fall away tros commanded take
my cloak and turn in
  aye aye master

the man to share that kind of secret
nor to let his men even suspect it
  even arsinoe who watched him with
a kind of cat-wise alertness wondered
at his apparent self-assurance she knew
as well as he how desperate the situa-
tion was but she had yet to learn the
first article of tros faith that luck is
on the side of him who knows luck when
he sees it
  luck began to arrive a full hour be-
fore dawn scores of the peasant-labor-
ers who had fled southward from the
burning barracks served as well as any
screen of scouting cavalry they gave
ample warning of the enemys advance
coming phantoming back to avoid being
caught and made to carry ammunition
water and other heavy burdens besides
they knew where the supplies of ground
millet onions radishes and oil were hid-
den in plundered tombs so they were
pounced on and looted in turn every
man in tros command had had a full
meal before sunrise chopping up the
gate for fuel and building their little
fires behind the wall out of sight of the
advancing enemy
  tros made his depositions long be-
fore daylight he could not afford to
occupy a wide front against what would
be overwhelming numbers unless his
force was concentrated and kept well in
hand his scouts reported six war-chari-
ots those would probably be manned by
archers and used for out-flanking pur-
poses
  he chose his battle-front with chari-
ots in mind taking sigurdsen conops
and five decurions to point out to them
exactly the positions they should take
up and they marked their stations to
avoid confusion he let his men lie at
ease behind the wall avoiding the usual
roman commanders mistake of upset-
ting nerves by getting tired men too
soon into the battle-line
  arsinoe came with him there was no
denying her she was silent but she
seemed to be studying tros and his
depositions as if destiny depended not
on what he would do but on under-
standing how and why he did it a long
thighed actively striding girl looking
in her armor like a lad of eighteen sig-
urdsen paid her a good deal of attention
he told her her hair was like a norse
girls and that it was a pity she should
die so young and lovely
  for here we die but we will hew
our swath first and perhaps they will
take you prisoner

adventure
  satisfied with his own assigned posi-
tion sigurdsen took little interest in the
rest of tros arrangements although he
gave advice when asked
  the left wing was to rest on the long
wall with the gate fifty yards to its rear
-seamen under the command of two
decurions pertinax and thestius
  the right wing under conops consist-
ing of the ten jews and thirty seamen
was to rest against a honeycomb of open
tombs that would make them very diffi-
cult indeed to outflank sigurdsen and
his battle-axemen were to hold the cen-
ter facing nearly due south
  tros himself with three decurions and
thirty men would take position with
their backs to the well in reserve to
reenforce any part of the line that
looked like breaking between the cen-
ter and the wings on either side some
captured laborers were put to digging
short trenches in which the archers were
to keep cover and be frugal with their
perilously scanty ammunition
  facing south by southwest with the
pyramids on their left hand they would
not have the sun in their eyes as the
enemy would have should they attempt
a turning movement
  at last arsinoe broke silence
  and i lord captain where is my
place
  your men will be distributed to fight
under my decurions i have ordered it
so
  she answered him very calmly and
without heroics but she held her chin
high
  is this not my battle is it yours
only do you think because i am a
woman and a ptolemy i am unfit to
lead my own men they are my men
  you will obey me
 then command me
  it was true he had ignored her he
could have told her to hide in a tomb
but he knew he would have to assign
valuable men to keep her from coming
out
  you will stand by me with the re-
serve
  she saluted he returned into the
enclosure and talked to the men ex-
plaining to them what they would be
called upon to do wasting no breath on
bombast
  you men know me and i know you
he said finally let us remember we are
proud to be comrades in arms
  there was no mistaking their answer
it was the growling roar of men who
will do their ungrudging utmost after
that he led his archers to the trenches
and gave each man careful instruction
  daybreak revealed the enemy less
than half a mile distant but tros posi-
tion would remain for a long while yet
in shadow the intervening sand was
ominously strewn with mummies that
resembled blackened corpses on a
stricken battle-field evidently conops
had only seen about half of the men at
the temple up-river the combined forces
of the enemy in dense formation looked
like five or six hundred men some of
them were probably non-combatants
but there seemed too to be armed men
in reserve in the shadow around and
behind a quite small pyramid there
were six two-horsed chariots out in front
in line and in one of them stood a
woman not in armor
  she had two fan-bearers up behind
her fans such as those were the royal
insignia her chariot was surrounded by
a dozen footmen in splendid armor
scouting ahead was a line of about thirty
men advancing timidly expecting to be
met by arrow-fire from ambush
  boidion arsinoe laughed boidion
you poor fool
  not boidions chariot but another
came trotting forward alone the inten-
tion was obvious from behind the
screen of scouts its occupant proposed to
harangue tros men to offer terms and
perhaps to offer a price for tros him-
self dead or alive but there was no
sign of tros actual position until the
cleopatras promise

chariot approached
too near to the hur-
riedly dug trench-
es
 then a bow
drawn by a
cretan archer
twanged the
plumed and cloak-
ed occupant of the
chariot fell back-
ward clutching an
arrow that pierced
his throat the
charioteer whirled
his horses and gal-
loped away the
dead mans cloak
became a range-
mark for the arch-
ers
       it was
then that
conops
t r  m pet
sounded battle
stations the y
poured through the
gate in good or-
der in no haste to
their appointed
places in the line
it was too late
then for the enemy
to alter a plan of
battle conceived
in the dark in
overconfidence a
maneuver now at
such close quarters
would have offered
tros too good an
opportunity to
strike and rout the
maneuvering companies
  nor was it possible to come at his
flank without being thrown into con-
fusion by the honeycomb of open tombs
and to get behind him would entail a
long march leav-
ing a reduced force
facing them
  their strategy
was as evident as
daylight failing
overtures to rely
on overwhelming
numbers they
could no more
afford to try to
starve tros out
than could he af-
ford to refuse bat-
tle they must
snatch swift vic-
tory or else aban-
don hope of taking
memphis the city
would surely not
surrender to them
and incur the risk
of cleopatras sub-
sequent revenge if
there were a
queens force un-
defeated within
striking distance
alexis might know
that the queen
had no trustworthy
forces to send to
tros support but
memphis didnt
know that what
memphis did know
was that the
queen held hostage
and would be ruth-
less it was fight
or fail before rebel-
lion had well be-
gun
   so the chariots
wheeled away to the enemys left flank
a fanfare of trumpets split the morning
air there arose a roar from the enemys
ranks and the advance commenced with
barely space enough between the serried

adventure
companies to cushion the inevitable
pressure of the wings on the center as
they charged a narrower front than their
own
  tros up on the well-coping with his
back to the wooden gallows-post
groaned for his triremes arrow-engines
they were a motley host that came
against him-men of all races armed as
happened there were greeks in light
hoplite armor archers in bronze and
leather pikemen in heavy armor hel-
meted like roman gladiators coal-black
nubians in lion-skin with ox-hide shields
and iron-bladed stabbing spears that
danced in the sun to the time of their
thundering song
  in the center marched a heavy pha-
lanx eighty strong of men who looked
like thracians a scattering of roman
uniforms some turbaned parthians
arabs but no native egyptians except
the wretched peasantry who lugged
heavy arrow-baskets in the rear of the
thundering ranks ninety per cent of
the officers were kilted greeks out in
front of their men
  it was a force that should have wilted
away under the fire of well-drilled arch-
ers and tros archers were experts but
he had had to order them to hold fire
until they could make every last arrow
count at close range men had been
told off to gather the enemys arrows to
replenish the few dozen that each archer
had stuck in the sand in the trench be-
side him
  sigurdsens men crouched in the arch-
ers trenches leaving a tempting gap for
the advancing phalanx it came on at
the double-a slow heavy-pounding
jog-trot to break tros line at the gap
tros archers at less than fifty yards
range sent a sudden screaming hail of
arrows into the light infantry on either
flank of the phalanx checking for a mo-
ment halting them in confusion
  the phalanx came on alone led by a
macedonian protected by two swords-
men all three fell to sigurdsens axe-
three swipes that split them down be-
fore they could think how to engage the
unfamiliar weapon those were the first
three to be slain in close combat
  sigurdsen went berserk heaving the
officers corpse left-handed he hurled it
against three spearmen leaped into the
gap and battle-axed a swath for his men
to follow through they went in wedge-
wise long spears once their front was
broken were as useless against axes as
so many ornamental awning-poles
  they were worse than useless the
swinging axes shored through bronze ar-
mor or beat men to earth by the sheer
weight of the blow the recovering
back-handed up-swing was equally
deadly cleaving arm-pits laying bellies
open splitting unguarded chins
  the phalanx went down and was not
three wounded northmen rolled into an
archers trench and sigurdsen went for-
ward he and his men roaring their bat-
tle-cry
  tros tros
that was contrary to orders
tros had forbidden a charge
until he should perceive the
right moment both his wings
were being hard pressed conops on the
right wing appeared to be doing well
against nubians who were no match
for the seamen who had stood off board-
ers in the storm off salamis but the
seamen on the left wing under pertinaux
and thestius were being forced back-
ward along the wall
  the line was becoming bent like a
taut bow two companies of the enemy
formed column and rushed at a converg-
ing angle to split tros line in half by
storming the gap that the northmen
had left in their rear the northmen
were cut off-surrounded- fighting back
to back
  tros went into battle then he
charged with all his reserves behind
him to make the gap good
  there was ten minutes carnage
cleopatras promise

wounded with an arrow through the
calf of his leg recklessly protected by his
seamen tros held the line until at last
the storming companies recoiled and
sigurdsen ten northmen shy fought his
way back exhausted bleeding leaning
on his axe to recover breath while his
men rallied in line in the gap
  tros archers reopened a withering fire
with the enemys squandered arrows
the enemys center was beaten discour-
aged and out of control
  charge yelled sigurdsen
  tros smote him there was no other
way to check that battle-drunkard the
left wing was curling up the enemy
had fought their way along the wall
the wall was in the way of a right-
handed man but they had won by
weight of numbers they were forming
with their backs to the wall on tros
flank
  tros had forgotten arsinoe now he
saw her fighting on the left wing dis-
obedient but as good as a standard to
rally around she was in the midst of
her own ex-pirates plugging a gap in the
recoiling left wing they were fighting
for her like well trained and determined
devils
  tros struck sigurdsen again to get his
full attention he sent him with all his
northmen hot-foot to reinforce the left
wing
  hold them until i join you
  tros had seen his chance-the enemys
mistake five chariots and at least a
hundred men had been detached to
make a westward circuit away around
beyond the right wing with the obvious
intention to attack from the rear it
would take them more than an hour to
make that march over wind-rippled sand
-perhaps longer
  at the same time their right wing was
being heavily reinforced by men march-
ing in column in an effort to drive a
wedge between tros and the wall they
intended to have the wall tros saw fit
to let them have it they had left the
line toward the boats wide open all their
reserves had been detached for that en-
circling movement
  tros sent a man to command arsinoe
to come away from the left wing and
meanwhile reorganized his center lie
sent another man for conops who ar-
rived breathless conops went down on
his knees and carefully cut through the
shaft of the arrow that had pierced tros
leg leaving about two inches of the shaft
protruding
  stand by for a hot one master
  he struck the protruding shaft one
hard blow with the hilt of his heavy
knife then seized the arrow-point with
his teeth and pulled it through he
wiped the blood off his face and looked
swiftly for a dead or wounded man
from whom to strip some sort of band-
age
  arsinoe had come tros was swear-
ing at her she had on a gossamer linen
dress beneath her chain mail conops
as quick as lightning knifed off yards of
the thin material and she laughed as he
bound it around tros leg artfully plac-
ing a pad to stop the bleeding
  what now master
  tros used terse sea-phrases to explain
a land maneuver
  east-south-east in line ahead until i
change helm
  aye aye
  conops returned to the right wing
within a minute there began one of
those brilliant maneuvers that if they
succeed are reckoned proof of mili-
tary genius but if they fail are de-
nounced as rash unmartial errors of a
fool an impossible maneuver without
splendid discipline it almost failed be-
cause sigurdsen hated to yield ground
tros threw his whole line into column
conops leading and himself in com-
mand of the rear that had been his left
wing he outflanked the enemys left
  the very suddenness of the maneu-
ver threw the enemy into confusion
they found themselves some with their
adventure
flank against the wall some with their
backs to the wall some of them holding
the line that tros had held and their
left wing reeling routed as the astonish-
ing column changed front their bag-
gage-guard bolted there was not much
baggage it was principally arrows
  again the amazing column changed
front-a mere eighty battle-weary men
conops golden trumpet sounded the
charge and tros led them limping they
were into the enemys rear before they
knew what to expect their commander
was shot down they milled broke tried
to retreat through the gap in the walled
enclosure throwing all the rest of the
force into hopeless confusion into which
tros archers poured a devastating hail
of captured arrows
  the one chariot that had not been
sent with the reserves on that fatal en-
circling movement tried to escape in the
direction of the nile tros archers
mowed down the horses boidion was in
the chariot-boidion alexis and one
other- man in roman equestrian uni-
form-a hook-nosed mean-faced etrus-
can named lars tarquinius
  boidions fan-bearers lay dead on a
stricken field beside aristobolus and a
heap of dead and dying most of the
remaining enemy scattered across the
honeycomb of tombs toward the encir-
cling column in the distance but some
threw down their arms
  no cavalry pursuit was impossible
there was nothing whatever that tros
could do then but set the prisoners to
work to gather up his wounded and to
retire on his boats before the fleeing
enemy could reach them there were
only ten blistered seamen guarding the
flotilla
  it was little more than an hour since
sunrise vultures in dozens flew down
from the broken ledges of the second
pyramid in the near distance the
sphynx half smothered in drifted sand
inscrutably suggested that there still was
a problem for tros to solve
chapter xi
what do you wish
roll-call only eight-
and-eighty men left stand-
ing transportation for the
wounded was the first prob-
lem memphis could look to itself the
less memphis learned about two arsi-
noes the better fugitives who had lost
their claimant to the throne and with
most of their officers dead were no dan-
ger at all outlaws they would scatter
or be hunted down and executed or en-
slaved
  there were more than a hundred men
and five chariots with some mounted
officers still in the field as a unit but
they were several miles away and had
nothing to fight for unless they should
attempt to rescue boidion they were
far more likely to assume that boidion
was dead
  true five chariots and a dozen
mounted officers might do a good deal
to harass tros line of retreat to the
boats but they were much more likely
to save their horses for flight to pre-
serve their own skins
 seven northmen dead eleven
wounded three decurions dead includ-
ing the gallant thestius sigurdsen out
of his head with wounds and melan-
choly following on battle-frenzy it was
always that way with sigurdsen after a
hard fight he had to be sung to by the
skald too many prisoners some of
whom however begged to be enslaved
by tros but some were undoubtedly
getting the story of two arsinoes and
it was not in the least improbable that
one or two of them were queens spies
she was better served by her spies than
by her generals
  prisoners were put to work to strip
and bury the enemys dead the battle-
field loot was tros seamens perquisite
and they burdened themselves with
plundered armor tros dead were laid
cleopatras promise

in a line in a trench that the egyptians
had dug in search of ancient tombs
and as he had done after salamis he
lined up the survivors for a last fare-
well salute and with his right hand
raised pronounced his blessing
  ye who dwell beyond the veil of
death receive these my men who have
died with their honor upon them cred-
itably give them honorable greeting
even as we their comrades bid their
gallant souls farewell
  he had no word yet with boidion
she and arsinoe walked and talked to-
gether looking strangely alike even
though the one wore armor and the other
a sort of priestess costume and a gar-
land their ex-pirate escort kept at a
respectful distance separating them from
tarquinius whose hands were tied be-
hind him and from alexis who was not
bound because he was wounded
  the chariot loaded with armor and
weapons was dragged by seamen and
tros paid a lot of attention to it it
had given him an idea the wounded
such as could not walk between unin-
jured men were carried on the backs of
prisoners and on stretchers made of
spears and reed mats taken from the
northmens prison
 twenty men were sent ahead in a
hurry to guard the boats from fugitives
twenty men brought up the rear and
retirement began
  it resembled defeat not victory but
tros knew and all his men knew that
he had saved the day for egypt only
tros knew what a problem he had yet to
solve he walked alone unarmored
switching flies and limping leaving the
command to conops who had caught
an officers gray nag and was clowning
the part of a roman general on parade
  they were not pursued and there
was not much fighting near the boats
although a group of fugitives did try to
rush one boat and make away with it
tros took his entire force and all his
prisoners across the river and sent a
messenger at once up-river to the temple
to command the priests to come and care
for his wounded on pain of having their
temple burned and laid waste
  he set the prisoners to work to build
a reed encampment counted arsinoes
camels checked her supplies and then
sent four more boats up-river with a de-
mand on the priests for provisions for a
week for his entire force then he
questioned arsinoes slaves and at last
seated on a camel-saddle beneath a hur-
riedly constructed bower of reeds with
one of arsinoes slaves to flick the flies
away he sent for boidion
  she stood smiling at him arsinoe to
the life except for a vaguely absent ele-
ment of self-assurance the queens and
arsinoes grandmother had been a jew-
ess the coincidence of likeness was as-
tonishing but not after all such a mir-
acle this girl could have easily passed
for cleopatras sister although she and
arsinoe were much more beautiful than
the queen as well as taller and with far
less prominent noses
  tros ordered another camel-saddle to
be brought that she might be seated
he gave her a fly-switch that she might
be at ease then he asked her suddenly
have you counted the number of
men who have died for your false ad-
venture
  no lord tros her face changed
she appeared now to expect to be exe-
cuted out of hand
  he paused affording her full oppor-
tunity to excuse herself or to explain if
she should see fit but she was silent
was it your fault he demanded
yes i did it it was not my own
idea it was suggested to me but i did
it who wouldnt snatch at a throne if
the chance were offered but for the
stroke of a scribes pen i too am a
ptolemy
  you have taken anothers name
said tros and he made his voice sound
stern because he was not yet sure of that
others spirit nor sure that he might not

adventure
have to drag this girl to alexandria to
measure the queens mercy and he
wanted to arouse no false hope how
can you restore her name to her you
having so misused it
  does she want it boidion retorted
have you asked her
  no but i will
  he requested arsinoes presence so
they brought another camel-saddle and
she came and sat facing boidion wear-
ing a plain greek amorgina of such fine
bleached flax that it resembled silk it
was of the latest court fashion she had
very evidently had the pick of esias
imported merchandise had good needle-
women with her and was not inclined to
appear before tros at a disadvantage
she smiled at boidion with malice but
without any trace of contempt
  this girl- tros began
  my fathers daughter said arsinoe
boidion said tros has assumed
your name
  so i am nameless
  do you wish it you are queen of
cyprus
  i have told you and again i say it
i am sick of being queen of cyprus
never again will i go to cyprus never
i have been a plaything of the vilest
traitors that ever bought and sold each
other and themselves and their power-
less victim so if this fool wishes to be
queen of cyprus let her be it
  tros prodded the earth with his sword
he stared at boidion suddenly he asked
her
  woman you have taken one step
will you take the other and the conse-
quences or will you plead for the
queens mercy
  boidion answered
  you have heard her speak and she
said it to me when we walked together
i am as much a ptolemy as she is and
perhaps more capable of being queen
since she seems to have had small plea-
sure of it and no profit
  tros met arsinoes eyes again
  you yield your throne
  i have thrown it away for any fool
to have who craves it
  you yield your name
  it is stolen let her have it i will
choose a new name
  he stared at boidion considering
her and then pronounced his verdict
queen of cyprus then you shall be
and arsinoe you are from this day for-
ward and the consequences be on your
head never again answer to the name
of boidion you hear me
  if i am a queen you should address
me more respectfully she answered
tros smiled he commanded
the etruscan to be brought be-
fore him he came with his
hands still tied behind his
back between two seamen they had
taken away his helmet but he looked
rather spruce in his roman uniform-
lean mean avaricious but possessed of
a kind of courage he kept shaking his
head to shake off flies tros ordered his
hands loosened and a fly-switch given to
him he looked at neither woman-
looked straight at tros sly-eved and
daring
  lars tarquinius you are a treacher-
ous faithless unscrupulous lving scoun-
drel
  have i ever pretended to you to be
anything else tarquinius answered
you may as well omit the ciceronian
oration captain tros you have a use
for me or you would have ordered me
killed and thrown to the crocodiles
what is it or have i come to hear sen-
tence of death it wouldnt be like you
to waste a sensible man like me
  you were left in cyprus in command
of the queen of cyprus bodyguard
said tros and with authority from
cassius and brutus conferred upon von
by the roman admiral ahenobarbus to
advise the queen how to conduct her
affairs you will return to cyprus tak-
ing the queen of cyprus with you
how when
cleopatras promise

  now and by use of your ingenuity
tros gestured toward boidion pre-
sent your respects to queen arsinoe of
cyprus
  lars tarquinius gaped even he past-
master spy opportunist agent of sedi-
tion and secret treasons was too as-
tonished for speech then a smile stole
over his hungry face
  our respects he said  think are
due to captain tros but-who shall
guarantee us that this other who so re-
sembles her-for the first time he
glanced at arsinoe-will not-
  i will guarantee your death tros in-
terrupted if i ever hear of you men-
tioning this lady whom you have never
seen nor ever knew and even of whose
name you are ignorant you left cyprus
in a design on the throne of egypt with
that princess with whom you will now
return to cyprus having failed of your
purpose for the rest silence
  tarquinius gulped tros commanded
the lord alexis to be brought in and he
came with his hand on a seamans shoul-
der looking gray-lipped and crestfallen
  you deceived me tros he began
bitterly
  do you wish to go to the queen i
will not deceive you about that if you
would like to offer her your felicitations
alexis avoided the eyes of the women
lie glanced at tarquinius who made no
sign whatever
  do you wish me to plead for your
mercy he asked then staring straight
at tros if you will spare my life i
will forever be your grateful client
shake hands with your ally tarqui-
nius tros answered make your bow
to your new queen you are to go with
her to cyprus there are camels waiting
doubtless there are prisoners who are
willing to make the journey with you
you may choose from among them as
many as there are camels to carry them
you and they may have weapons and i
will supply provisions
  i have no money alexis answered
  you have an order on the queens
treasury havent you use that i am
not your banker
  it is worth my life to use that
die then you have cost me more
good men than your convenience is
worth i have nothing to add beyond
that you may have your luggage i will
tell the priests to bring it
  boidion smiled at arsinoe
  and what will you do
  i will pity you she answered
  at a gesture from tros the seaman
touched tarquinius shoulder boidion
caught tros eye he nodded and she
went out with alexis except for the
slave who plied the fly-switch he was
alone with a girl who had thrown away
throne and name he knew why she
had thrown them away
  she had placed herself utterly in his
power and to befriend her would be
treason against cleopatra as arsinoe
well knew but she seemed unafraid
confident they were silent about twenty
switches of the slaves arm then it was
she who broke the silence
  so you see i cant get killed in
battle
  i will speak with my man conops
he answered
  she mocked him
  dont order him to kill me do it
yourself
  i will come to your tent
  and kill me
  go and wait for me he answered
the slave followed her to her tent
and in a few minutes conops came
  the priests are here master eight of
em hairless as sharks theyve turned
to with the wounded may i fetch one
to dress that scratched leg

  he and she entered the tent one of
her women closed the flap behind them
smiling and then ran because conops

chapter xii
egypts need
alexandria lay serene
and lovely beneath the mid-
night moon from the queens
balcony there was a view of
the whole harbor and half of the city
the great pharos beacon glowed like a
ruby and the anchored shipping seemed
a-swim in a silvered lake over to the
westward at the shoreward end of the
flickering lights of rhakotis were two
big basket-flares that tros knew were
the watch-lights where his trireme lay
awaiting orders for repairs
  the queen rebuked him for pacing
the balcony
  you irritate me and besides your
leg is not yet healed be seated
egypt-
  so you say they fled by camel on
whose camels
  how should i know he was grow-
ing angry he had answered her ques-
tions again and again perhaps some-
body in memphis
  i have laid a fine on memphis that
will not encourage them to play again
with treason why did you send all your
men to pelusium
  he looked hard at her and his eyes
were as steady as hers lie lied and she
knew he was lying and he meant that
she should
  to keep my northmen out of mis-
chief they are angry that you sent
them to a prison-camp merely because
they broke the heads of men who spoke
loosely of you
ml
cleopatras promise

 and you cant control them i
could who are the women who availed
themselves of your mens escort the
women who are now in pelusium i
have heard there are three
merchants wives he answered
oh
  yes
whose wife is the one named hero
egypt there are questions that are
best unasked he stood up i have
saved your throne i have done your
errand now keep your promise
  i am grateful even though you do so
curiously harbor-an unknown woman
she answered suddenly her voice
changed i sent you to kill instead
you say you say you say you sent ar-
sinoe back to cyprus you have taken
your northmen without my leave and
in pelusium you have a woman a
woman named hero oh my spies are
awake though my generals sleep
egypt i hold your promise no no
it was cleopatras promise i have done
my duty by you it is time now for me
to repair my trireme and to set sail 
the voyage of which you know
  with this woman named hero
suddenly he noticed she was smiling
she was gazing westward toward rha-
kotis and her smile was triumphant
  tros turned and followed her gaze
where the basket-fiares had glowed 
the throat of night there was now a bil-
lowing holocaust-a black cloud red-lit
from beneath by a burning hull high on
the ways at esias wharf it was too
far away for the roar of the flames to be
heard but a mast fell and the sparks
volcanoed skyward as tros watched and
he could see the phantom figures of his
seamen or perhaps esias slave-gangs
beating out sparks  the warehouse
roofs
  what burns asked cleopatra
  tros met her eyes in silence
  your trireme
  he nodded not trusting himself to
speak
  dreadful oh well one can build
another ship there are also other
women
  cleopatras promise he said grimly
  egypts need she answered if the
woman in pelusium is who i think she
is nothing less than your obedience to
me can save both of you from death for
treason oh yes you may go and watch
your ship burn come and tell me about
it tomorrow there is a task i will ask
you to undertake
the end

the golden
emblem
siie was bluff in the bow she was
square-sterned she was flat-bot-
tomed her sides were like walls
she steered ill she rolled drunkenly
she waddled like an old washerwoman
who has borne very many children
there was no grace in her having com-
pleted her building her builder fuddled
his brain with rum he named her while
in his cups
  i dont like her name said the mer-
chant who bought her for a song after
she had sailed the seas for many years
ill change it
  no ill leave it stand said the
merchant staring at the faded lettering
to change a ships name brings her bad
luck they say the captain of a swift
clipper passing overheard the words
  leave her name stand said the
clipper captain laughing its a fine
name and its all that looks well about
the old hooker the merchant let it
stand
  she carried a captain two mates a
carpenter a steward cook and a dozen
able seaman-simple men with furrowed
sea-tanned faces and windy eyes some
were old some young some bearded
some smooth-faced
 she left the chincha islands on a
blazing day overloaded because of the
greed of her owner her holds filled with
guano-with the dry droppings of ten
hundred million sea fowl her decks
were deep in guano dust her masts
spars rigging rails were heavily coated
with it the faces of her people their
hands their clothing were thick with
the dry dust
  trying to break her anchor from the
sea bottom her seamen grunted
the golden emblem

crew mister said the skipper
  yes sir they can always raise a
laugh said the mate
  the skipper his eyes on the barks
name on a lifebuoy thought i wish she
was in falmouth
  having set sail they washed the
decks down as having put away the
brooms and buckets they came back to
the deck a puff of wind came it flapped
the sails full and died instantly from
the sails a cloud of guano dust drifted
to the deck covering it with a reeking
gray film astern lay the chinchas fad-
ing very slowly from view ahead a
glazed horizon glimmered beyond a
glazed hot sea the bells struck for mid-
day a sailor went to the cooks galley
for dinner
  i opes there aint no guano in the
pea soup doctor were tired o guano
soup he said to the cook
  youll ave to be tired then said
the cook
  you could keep your door shut and
keep the dust out doctor said the
sailor
  an gel roasted alive in ere eh
asked the cook
for twenty degrees of lati-
tude for twelve hundred
miles the bark sailed slowly
day by day night by night in
tiny tropic airs over a glazed sea to-
ward a glazed horizon-her sails scarce
ever full the bubbles rippling slowly past
her sides-sails ropes rigging masts
spars thick with gray dust that fell in
a cloud to the decks each time they
tightened the braces and halliards at
morning and evening day by day the
pitch bubbled from her deck seams
morning noon night they flung sea-
water on her decks to swell the seams
  after more than three weeks the sky
grew beclouded a drizzle fell a brisk
wind rose the bark rolled her bows
squatting heavily down on the seas los-
ing his footing on the slimy deck a sailor
fell rising he said i dont want to
never see no more sea birds look at
the slime a flowin from the riggin an
drippin on the deck ugh
  youll be a sea bird yerself wen yer

asked one
  quit thinking of beer get on with
your work said the mate get her
gear in good shape for the horn
  the breeze freshened the bark wal-
lowed on her crew all busy in her slip-
pery rigging
  it was morning the sun hung low
and black above the rolling mastheads
under topsails and courses her topgal-
lants and royals furled the bark stag-
gered southward pushing the sea from
her bluff bows rolling so that the water
gurgled in at her scupper holes and
flowed to and fro on her deck presently
rain fell a drowning torrent that ran
down her rigging washing away the last
of the guano dust
  its coming cold said a ailor
the golden emblem

  itll be cold you bet said another
this aint nothing yet shes steering
east by south for the horn
  it wasnt no fun in them chinchas
said one but itll be fun in falmouth

laughed an old fellow with a throaty
cackle

said the mate to himself
  what are the men laughing about
mister asked the skipper
  god knows sir theyre always
laughing at something or other said
the mate
  laughters good let them laugh
murmured the skipper his eyes on the
barks name on a lifebuoy
  it was eight oclock in the morning
the bark had all sail furled but her four
topsails an inky sky closed above her
rolling mastheads her bulwarks dipped
first on one then on the other side till
they dipped under the sea her decks
were aswirl with foamy white water
  first you roasts and then you
freezes said a sailor munching hard-
tack and sipping bitter coffee from a
dirty old tin pot in the focsle id
sooner be a dog
  all sailors is dogs wot ye kickin

  fore topsail downhaul shouted the
mate at their door
  hi-lee-oh-haul-away-oh cried a
a sailor singing out that all might pull
together on the topsail downhaul
  aloft and make it fast ordered the
mate when the sail was down they
swarmed into the rigging in oilskins and
seaboots a few snow flakes fell
  we must be off the horn sir said a
young fellow to the second mate beside
him on the footrope
  two more days yet said the second
mate
  cripey it aint goin to get no colder

gray man laughed

doyle for his boots they sang claw-
ing at the snow-covered canvas with
bare cold hands
  two days were gone it was evening
sea and sky were black and thunder-
ous ice on the rigging the sails the
spars snow and spray frozen on the
quivering shrouds they sat in the
focsle smoking black bassy while out-
side the sea raged the wind roaring in
a steady ceaseless monotone
  a sailor rose drew on his mittens and
left to go to the wheel in a minute the
man whom he had relieved entered the
focsle
  how is it on deck asked one as he
beat his cold hands on his sides
  hark to that dye hear that

poop

  at the wheel two helmsmen strained
holding the wallowing bark to her course
in fast gathering darkness
it was midnight the mates
watch on duty since eight
oclock were turning into their
bunks their oilskins and sea-
boots on the second mates men were
lighting their pipes on duty now till four
of the morning

mate and was gone
  the moon rose giving a faint light
through the dense clouds the wind
fallen a little now moaned the sea
moaned water gurgled to and fro on
the deck as the bark rolled icicles glim-
mered dimly on the rigging
  the lookout mans voice rang high
and sudden from the focsle head ice
right ahead sir
  the second mates men hearing that
cry ran to the deck wakened by that
cry the mates men leapt from their
bunks and followed
  hard up the helm came the skip-
pers loud shout to the helmsmen up
with the braces look alive he shouted
to the mate
  hawl-away-oh-hi-leeee-oh hi-
leee-oh cried a sailor singing out that
all might pull together
  sluggishly her bluff bows slatting
heavily down upon the tumbled seas the
bark paid off her wall sides rolling the
water gurgling all across her decks
  watch out for yourselves its going
to foul the yards shouted the mate as
the moon rose breaking through a cloud
rift gleamed on a great berg close down
on the bow
  its yard fouling a huge overhanging
ice cliff that projected from the berg
the fore topgallant mast crashed down
the main followed instantly carrying
away the topsail and the lower braces
smashing a great gap in the bulwarks to
starboard a mass of ice fell and slipped
overboard through the gap as the bark
rolled hiding the berg hiding the hang-
ing wreckage the moon went in
  get that wreckage cleared away all
hands shouted the skipper
  now howd you like a mug o hot
beer came a voice from the murk
 haw haw haw came throaty
laughter from the murk
  quit your laughing look alive with

as wed like a mug o hot beer sir
  in the darkness on his poop the skip-
per smiled
  shell be all right he murmured
 till dawn all hands-men mates
cook steward carpenter-toiled at
clearing the wreckage at reeving off new
topsail and new course braces with
dawn snow fell great flakes that drifted
slowly on the fallen wind and hid the sea
  doctor go make coffee said the
mate to the cook at dawn
  gathered in the focsle the men
sipped bitter coffee from tin pannikins
  heres how sir said an old fellow
lifting his pannikin to the mate
  drink hearty son said the mate
grinning drinking from the dirty dented
tin pot himself and passing it on to
the second mate who passed it to the
carpenter who drank and passed it to
the steward
  the skipper looked in
  every one all right he asked gaz-
ing from one to another
  were pretendin as were avin a
drink o falmouth beer sir said an
old fellow grinning up at the skipper
from under shaggy brows
  a young man asked will you take
her to the falklands for repair sir
the golden emblem

  the skipper beckoned the mate out to
the deck what do you think mister
he asked if we go to the falklands
for repairs well have to be there a long
time if we take her on as she is crippled
aloft we shall make a very long voyage
whichever we do i think that we shall
reach falmouth at much the same time
  whatever you say suits me sir said
the mate
  what about the crew mister the
skipper asked
  and thats the way well pay paddy
doyle for his boots came in a sudden
burst of uproarious song and laughter
from the focsle the mate looked
smiling at the skipper implying that the
skipper had his answer
  very well mister said the skipper
a look of relief on his face as soon as
theyve had breakfast and some rest set
the foresail and mainsail well go to
falmouth
  the mate looked into the focsle
  when youve had enough rest loose
the foresail and mainsail sons said he

the mate
  the men lept to their feet cheering
and started out to set the sails
  take your rest sons take your
rest said the mate

young fellow leaping into the shrouds
paying no heed to the mate
  stamping cold feet beating their
hands on their sides the crew talked of
falmouth and of beer
  oh do my johnnie bokerl come
rock and roll me over they sang sheet-
ing the sails home
  all morning it snowed-huge flakes
that hid the sea all morning the
crippled bark crept on her crew build-
ing a makeshift bulwark to take the
place of the bulwark the ice had
wrecked at noon they rested and ate
salt pork
  it tastes kind of queer said one
  its tasted kind of queer a long time
said another
  we was seven weeks under the sun

porks got spoiled said another
  if wed gone to them falklands wed

 wot ye kickin about asked
another
  whos kickin i aint a-kickin re-
torted the other
the bark was rolling slowly
up a light southeast trade
wind her sails barely filled
since the loss of the topgallant
masts two full months had dragged by
only once had the wind amounted to
more than a light air that once it had
blown hard from dead ahead for two
full weeks driving her off her course her
clumsy old hull making little else but
leeway because she lacked enough sail
for driving her into the wind
  its gettin warmer every day said
a sailor
  an the porks a gettin ranker every
day said another
  wait till shes well up in the tropics
said another
  rye-spose as we gets becalmed
on the line eh another said
  it was evening the last of the south-
east trade had died away the previous
night all day the bark had lain in a
flat calm with the sun overhead on the
line the pitch bubbled up from her
deck seams morning noon and even-
ing they had slapped sea water on her
decks to swell the seams now they
were eating hardtack with a smear of
marmalade on it drinking bitter coffee
from a dented dirty old tin pot at
noon they had eaten spoiled pork and
salty pea soup over a hundred and
twenty days were gone since they had
left the chinchas they were lean as
staves the mates the steward cook
carpenter and skipper were lean as
staves

  the mate having sounded the fresh
water tank went to the skipper on the
poop
  well have to cut down the water
allowance more still sir he said the
tanks almost empty
  maybe itll rain and we shall be able
to fill it said the skipper a frown on
his face his eyes perplexed and well
nigh desperate
  yes sir-maybe said the mate
  for twelve days the bark lay in a
flat calm water enough to keep her
people alive no more all day they
chewed buttons cut from their dun-
garees to keep the saliva flowing a little
they watched the glazed horizon for a
cloud
  if wed gone to them falklands wed
not be arf dead now said a thirsty
sailor
  were only arf dead wot ye kickin
about said another
  woos kickin i aint kickin said
the other
  beer a mug o good cold beer in a
falmouth pub said one
  quit talkin about cold beer ex-
claimed another every one laughed a
dry throaty cackle
  at dawn a black cloud appeared on
the sea rim they stretched the rain-
sail made it fast in both sides of the
main rigging led its canvas spout down
into the water tank while the black
cloud crept slowly over the glazed sky
they stripped their dungarees from their
lean shoulders naked they watched
the oncoming cloud
  hark at the rain a hissin said one
  its a solid wall aint it said
another
  i wisht as it was beer said another
every one laughed a dry throaty cackle
  they lay on their backs on the deck
their mouths wide open to catch the cool
rain they rolled over and over
stretched their refreshed limbs they
played leapfrog in the torrent slapping
each others bare buttocks and shout-
ing with laughter
  the rain passed on the tank was full
a little breeze ruffled the glazed tropic
sea they put their dungarees on for
a few moments their dungarees the sails
the decks steamed they were dry
  take off the hatch mister said the
skipper well lighten her well dump
some of the cargo to the sea
  working in a blazing sun in a cloud
of dense gray dust they threw guano to
the sea all day dust settled thick on
the sails the spars the deck the rig-
ging
  at dinner time the cook said i cant
elp ow the grub tastes its that there
guano dust
  a sailor eating dinner in the focsle
said the pork dont taste no wuss than
yesterday blame me if it dont taste
maybe a bit better eh every one
laughed
  for two days they dumped guano to
the sea the skipper and mate looking
over the side watched the bubbles that
drifted lazily by the barks wall sides
  the skipper said look at the length
of the seaweed on her sides below the
water line look at the barnacles her
bottoms so foul she couldnt make more
than four miles an hour with a gale at
her tail
  a sailor entering the focsle said
poor old lady shes got a dirty bot-
tom me byes
  that aint no way to talk about no
lady said another every one laugned
  cripey exclaimed a young fellow
looking from the focsle heres a school
o porpoises cornin to play under the
bow

mate if the carpenter was to make a
harpoon i could harpoon one o them
porpus i was in a whaler once
  chips can you make a harpoon
the mate asked the carpenter
the golden emblem

  i can make anything sir said chips
and soon the old gray fellow sat astride
the boom a harpoon poised in his
wrinkled hand
  for a week all hands ate their fill of
porpoise meat dark red flesh tasting
something not unlike beef steak said
the old gray man we aint a goin to
git scurvy for a time leastways boys
  the bark was wallowing up the west-
ern ocean making four miles an hour in
a stiff quartering wind leaning on her
rail all hands watched a tall three sky-
sail yarder coming up astern white
water breaking in great clouds of spray
from her driving bows her lee rail lying
down to the sea
  whats she signaling mister asked
the skipper
  she wants to know if we need any
assistance sir said the mate
  ask her if she can spare us a couple
of barrels of fresh pork said the skip-
per
  the mate said presently shes al-
most out of stores sir she cant spare
any at all
  the skipper called the crew to the
quarterdeck
  her bottoms getting fouler every
day men he said we may be sixty
days getting to falmouth you may
get scurvy do any of you want to
abandon ship
  an old gray fellow looked up and re-
plied we aint got scurvy yet sir
  the skipper said thank you men
id like to take her in if we anyhow
can
  well take her in and then well all
ave a good swig o falmouth beer sir
said the other gray fellow a cheer rose
from the crew and loud rollicking
laughter
  think it over while you have the
chance men said the skipper there
may be no other chance we may meet
no other ship
  to hell wid other ships sir cried a
young fellow we stays wid ih cld
golden emblem sir
the bark was tacking to and
fro in a stiff wind from dead
ahead from northeast making
little but leeway because of
her foul bottom and crippled tophamper
she had been tacking to and fro for nigh
a full month they had seen no more
porpoises no other ship the mate came
to the skipper on the poop
  two of them have scurvy sir he
said
  look ere sons said a sailor in the
focsle and poked a finger into his fore-
arm when he took it away the hole
it had made remained
  look at me gums byes said

one then wed not be avin no scurvy

another

the other
  night set in bringing a thick mist
that hid all things a few feet from the
wallowing bark a vessel could pass a
hundred feet away and not be seen for
three days the wet mist hid the sea late
in the fourth night the lookout man
shouted clear and high ship two points
on the port bow sir
  all hands ran to the deck to see a
red and green light coming out of the
mist
  down helm shouted the skipper
to the man at the wheel
  down helm it is sir said the man
at the wheel and then shes steerin
like a wash tub sir she dont pay off
  stand clear all hands shouted the
mate there was a loud splintering crash
forward the other ship had struck the
bark a glancing blow brought her fore
topmast down and gone clear
  shes holed forward sir said the
mate

adventure
  man the pumps mister said the
skipper
  clank clank clank came the creak
of the pumps all night the watch on
deck pumped the water flowing in as
fast as they could pump it out
  if it wasnt for the scurvy-if they
werent so weak-they could keep the
water down sir said the mate we
cant spare any one to clear the wrecked
topmast
  lash it so it cant roll about and
leave it hang mister shell crawl like
a snail now more than ever
  at dawn the skipper called all hands
to the quarterdeck
  if we take to the boats some ships
sure to pick us up were in the track
of ships he told them
  does you want to abandon her sir
asked a voice from the mist below him
  the skipper made no answer from
the thick mist there came the sound of a
low laugh
  lots o good beer in falmouth sir
a voice called the laugh spread from
man to man a hoarse ripple of amused
defiance the watch on deck returned
to the pumps
  twenty-four hours dragged on the
mate said the waters gaining on them
sir theyre too weak
  a squall whined over the mist-hid
sea the bark began to roll heavily
  its going to blow we cant leave
her now the boats couldnt live we
must stay till she sinks beneath us or-
der all hands to the pumps mister
said the skipper
  theyre all at the pumps sir they
didnt wait for orders said the mate
  all day all hands pumped the bark
rolled drunkenly creeping along like a
crippled snail the water gaining inch by
inch two men at the wheel no one man
was strong enough to hold her now
  were all goin to git drownded
boys said a voice from the murk
 we aint drownded yet wot ye
kickin about came instant reply
  all the way from the chinchas to
get a bottle o falmouth beer called a
hoarse voice some one laughed hoarse
unhopeful-yet defiant
  they can still laugh i wish i could
thought the skipper
  all night all day all night again they
pumped next dawn the mist thinned
just visible in the dim light land lay
ahead the bark was far below her
plimsoll mark the water gaining
  a ship came driving up from astern
flew a hurried signal
  shes asking if we want to abandon
her men called the skipper
  from the pumps a sailor called huski-
ly tell her to go to hell sir
  the other ship drove on cheering as
she passed scarce heard by those upon
her decks a feeble cheer replied
  the sun rose the wind ceased
  clank clank clank on and on un-
ceasing from the creaking pumps the
old bark crawling like a crippled snail
  in falmouth harbor the mate lowered
her topsails let her fore and main sheets
go and dropped her anchor while the
men still pumped tugs came speeding
toward her men leapt lightly over her
low rails and ran to her pumps
  the old barks sailors fell lay and sat
exhausted on her decks
  a bumboatman came aboard his arms
filled with fresh meat and vegetables
the barks sailors munched lying and
sitting exhausted on her deck
 another bumboatman came aboard
his arms full of bottles
  beer cried an old gray-headed
sailor falmouth beer boys weak
eager laughter rose from man to man
  all the way from them chinchas
boys heres how captain cried the
old gray-bearded man lifting his bottle
  heres how sir they all cried tip-
ping their bottles high
  the skipper glanced at the old barks
name on a lifebuoy
  courage murmured the skipper
courage-and with it laughter thats
the golden emblem
summer hand
it was as if the shrouded sky were
a giant sifter gently shaken salting
a vast burned steak siftily the
white grainy snow came sprinkling
down upon a blackened earth drifter
mclarden ducked the broad brim of his
carlsbad sombrero against the slight
slant of it as he rode he could hear the
small hard pellets of hominy snow
pelt upon it bounce away here now
was winter lie reflected holding its in-
augural dance on his hat and here now
was barren range where a week ago had
stood a brcwn nap of frost-seasoned
grass ripe and ready for winter grazing
and the bunch grass-charred little
hummocks now graying slowly with
lodging snow
  yonder was a little cove the grass-fire
scythe had missed and in it a few dozen
of the old mans summer-fattened cows
grazing lazily or bedded down at ease
belching fat cuds from well filled
paunches chewing in calm cow-content-
ment bovinely unaware of any startling
menace in the snow-sifty air they were
not hungry-yet the cattle could not
know that such little coves on old man

adventure
pryors ranch were now but scattered
spots on a wide black wasteland
  drifter mclarden knew it-surmised
it at least from what he saw as he ioped
ranchward from the beef delivery he had
made at the stockyards he knew it
would be a tough winter ahead short
feed extra riding bucking blizzardy
snowdrifts to scatter scanty hay cold
feet and freezing hands as you nursed
hospital stock into the sheds and cor-
rals the dirty work of skinning for old
man pryor always saved the dollar or
two to be got from a die-up hide
 all this mclarden knew-and he
didnt give a damn in a week he would
be far from here southward he was a
summer hand always when the frost
got sharp mclarden headed south
that was understood when old man
pryor hired him that was why they
called him drifter
  las cruces was no tropical paradise-
but it was a southward town mild
enough wild enough and not too far
from el paso on the border you didnt
have to hole up for the winter there
balmy it was there would be cards
for the drifters deft fingers and a
boarding house with woman-folks cook-
ing girls maybe let the card tables
contribute their unfailing bit to the
stake of his summer wages and mclar-
den would winter well and cozily
  only damn fools stayed north here
where you watered your horse each
morning through broken ice and now
with the old mans range grass-burned
to starvation to start with-well drifter
mclarden grinned at the pelting snow
pellets
 so long winter tomorrow im
headin south
as soon as he saw the jug-
head sorrel at the hitching post
mclarden scented trouble
old man frenchy doucette
owned the next ranch east across elbow
creek a bigger spread even than the
pryor layout plenty cattle plenty
grass plenty in the bank like as not
plenty patches on old frenchys overalls
too and plenty ratty the horseflesh that
they straddled
  drifter mclarden like the rest of ed
pryors riders shared their bosss con-
tempt for the doucette horseflesh the
doucette outfit and all the greasy-sack
qualities therein implied but old man
pryor himself went further he hated
frenchy doucette like a tall proud
wolfhound hates the mange he chose
not to forget the days when doucettes
had been a slipshod sheep ranch
  ol ed an  frenchy tugwire
harrison often put it leaning heavily
upon his hard-earned reputation for wit
wisdom and long distance accuracy with
tobacco juice jest two ol tomcats spit-
tin at each other acrost elbow crick-
frenchy skeered to come acrost an 
man ed glad of it
  but today through this thickening
spit of snow frenchy doucette had
come across
 trouble thought mclarden
quickly he dismounted and went inside
he passed without knocking into the
living room whence came the sound of
old man pryors razor-edged voice
  youre mighty kind doucette
pryor was saying but his voice would
have tested high in the acidity of sar-
casm mighty kind but-
  wait minoot frenchy doucettes
voice squeaked rustily friends we are
not meestaire pryore but neighbors
yes thats what i tell to myself all
night after i see thees fire what matter
to you francois doucette that it is not
friendship between you what matter
that he have so very steef the neck
thees meestaire pryore here is weenter
an he have no grass but doucette you
have very much grass very damn good
an he is your neighbor francois dou-
cette voila  he spread his gnarled
hands i am here vous voyez to make
the offer
  old man pryor looked briefly at mc-
larden as he came in amusement
summer hand

twitchcd faintly at the young cowboys
lips the look of stiff steely cold polite-
ness vanished suddenly from old pryors
eyes swift color reddened the brown
of his lean leathery face as temper
slipped its leash he stood up a ramrod
up his spine ilis doubled fist struck the
desk beside him with angry warlike
drumming
  neighbors eh he stormed and
you want to rent me grass hear me
doucette-ill pasture my stock in hell
before ill buy a blade from the man
who burnt me out now get out
  it was characteristic of frenchy dou-
cette that he habitually calmed in the
face of anothers anger he rose and put
on his battered old flop hat lie stepped
toward the door stopped faced around
  bien he said almost a whisper be-
tween thin white lips i go but as
concerns thees fire meestaire pryore-
you lie
  ed pryor stared incredulously at the
seedy looking man standing stooped but
uncringing before him the cold steel
blueness came back to his eyes his long
hand reached into a drawer of the desk
brought out a  from whose barrel
all the blue was leather-worn calmly
he dropped it into the open holster at his
thigh he brought his hands together in
front like a parson
  doucette he said go for your
gun
  frenchy shrugged grimaced his right
hand pushed back the too-long flap of
his faded blue jumper like all of fran-
cois doucettes movements the motion
was quick nervous smooth as the flap
of a hawkwing ed pryors right hand
swung down backward and swifter yet
forward again and up the worn gun
butt firm in the grip of his palm
  but a swifter hand than his clamped
like a claw upon his wrist its nails bit
deep as the mate to that hand wrenched
the  free from his fingers there was
a crash and clatter of broken glass as
the heavy sixgun hurtled through the
window into the snow-sifty air and fell
thumpily to the frozen ground drifter
mclarden stood calmly between the two
men his back to old frenchy
  you better set down ed he advised
gently youre kinder wrought up i
reckon not to see that he didnt have
no gun
  he jerked his chin toward the door
you better button up frenchy he
snapped sharply youll be facin the
storm goin home vavios
  bien shrugged old doucette and
went out surprisingly ed pryor sat
down
  drifter mclarden leaned against a
table slowly making a smoke he
fished papers from inside his jacket
  we loaded wednesday mornin ed
he reported as if nothing had happened
two cars all in good shape franks
ridin with em like you said here-
he handed out the papers-is the lad-
ings
  old man pryor took them in silence
one fist drummed the desk-top in slow
hard thumps veins corded his fore-
head when he spoke his voice was flat
and harsh
  you were figgering to pull out tomor-
row mclarden
  why yes the cowboy smiled a little
i reckon you know how my stick points
south ever year come snow-time ed
my regular time is out tomorrow but
if this-this here grass burnin gives you
some extra work i reckon i could stretch
a point an stay on a few days more-a
week maybe if-
  week hell old man pryor pounded
the desk tomorrow be damned mc-
larden youre leaving tonight an
damn you for a meddlesome hellion
dont you let me see hide nor hair of you
back here in the spring neither youre
fired-now-this minute get out
pryor stood again now threat of
imminent violence in his pose drifter
mclardens wide easy mouth no longer
smiled but his voice still came evenly
almost casually past the cigarette that
hung from a lip corner

adventure
  better take a dally on yourself ed
he commented quietly youre lible to
bust a hame-string
  quite soberly he picked up his damp-
brimmed hat and went out he could
hear the old man stomping up and
down inside the house behind him
  he unsaddled and went on down to
the bunkhouse through the thickening
snow except for the gawky frame of
tugwire harrison sprawled on a rawhide
rocker by the stove whittling the
cozy shack was empty a couple of
hands was all old man pryor usually
kept on during the winter with the stock
all under fence on the main home ranch
the rest had gone in with the shipping
drive
  hi-yah drifter the whittler greeted
him take off yer hat an rest yer
ears no sunny southland fer your
lazy carkiss this winter eh
  no who says so
  aint told you yet eh why the
old man sonny sez to me this morn-
in he sez tugwire im goin to need

a boghole nossir i sez ol
drifter- 
  old drifter put in the other short-
ly is headin south as usual tomorrow
morning an what do you say to that
for answer the elderly tugwire harri-
son spat eloquently into the sandbox be-
side the stove
  mclarden went up to supper along
with tugwire as if nothing were amiss
old man pryor was a childless widower
he kept a mexican cook and ate with
his cowhands tugwire harrison batted
his little badgerish eyes at the strained
silence of the other two men all through
tle meal
  he surmised reckoned and calkilated
at length about the origin of that grass
fire some town feller out deer huntin
if yasked him like as not keerless with
his smokin knotheads that they was
these town fellers too damn bad it
hadnt burnt off ol frenchy across the
crick instid might of ketched fire to
some of them woolly cayuses ol frenchy
made out to use for hosses if it had
  tugwire chuckled and whacked his
thighs at the highly imaginative vision
of them ratty bush-tailed ponies of ol
doucettes quitin the kentry in a blaze
of burnin hoss-hair
  mclarden kept a discreet silence
  after the meal pryor handed him an
envelope with some bills in it final
settlement for his summers work
  count it said the older man
  what for mclarden grinned and
shoved the bills in his pocket see you
at breakfast ed
  the old man scowled started to say
something changed his mind about it
and went out
  what ails him snorted tugwire
didnt hardly eat no supper an-
  doucette said mclarden paid
him a call this evenin maybe it kinder
took his appetite
an hour after first dawn-
light drifter mclarden was
riding southward leading a
packhorse bearing his hot-roll
and war-bag the snow had stopped the
wind came now sharp and cold out of
the northeast the earth lay under a
grainy six inch blanket wind-rippled on
top and drifted here and there dead
white under a clear but dingy sky off
eastward the still invisible sun reddened
dully the great black bank of cloud that
sulked along the horizon last nights
skiff of snow had been but a sample
sure enough weather was making yonder
in the northeast
  mclarden angled his face away from
the sharp cross-bite of the wind his
left foot on the windward side he
stomped a little in the stirrup to warm
the toes he had never owned a pair of
summer hand

overshoes and why should he today
he would noon in a sheltered cove well
down below the wintry rim of these
high mesas tomorrow lie would be in
the valley following the rio down and
down ever southward until  longer
would the fangs of the norther snap at
his heels
  maybe the next day he would begin to
see blackbirds again it was a pleasant
warmish sound they made blackbirds
kinder made him think of the soft
voices of the two pretty coyotas the
half-french half-mexican girls who
waited table at mom dawsons board-
ing house in cruces
  he worked the chill-stiffened fingers
in his buckskin gloves they were slender
fingers it seemed to him that already
they riffled the cards in the pleasant
warmth of monte smith wicks snug
saloon
 unconsciously mclarden added a
little pressure to the spurs southward
  at the south sacaton gate he had to
crowd his horse through a jam of cattle
storm drifted lodged there in the corner
against stout fencing they were not
poor cattle these fifty-odd head but
they were bawling already from empty
stomachs their trampling had pounded
the snow from a wide circle north of the
fence the revealed ground was sooty
black grassless mclarden was too
much cowboy not to notice how sunken
their flanks were-already it doesnt
take long for even a fat cow to starve
on nothing
  mclarden shoved through to the gate
and got down to open it his chilled
fingers fumbled the lever stick clumsily
loosened the catch loop started to swing
the gate open but instead he jerked it
shut again fastened it
  hell he grunted and tied his pack-
horse to the fence i can spare an hour
i reckon
  he stepped up to the saddle
  hee-yi-ee hoop-yoo move out
  the cattle had no mind to go in the
face of the sharpening wind lanced as
it was with whirls of picked-up snow it
took mclarden a good two hours of
steady monotonous shoving to work
them back north to a rough rock-
rimmed cove where he had noticed in
passing bunch grass sticking up a foot
above the snow-an acre or so the fire
had missed and then it was of little
use
  another bunch of cattle-maybe a
hundred head-were already in the cove
they had its scattered bunch grass
clumps about cleaned up
  mclarden felt the chill of cooling
sweat go over his body he growled
out a few choice phrases of profanity
  hee-yi-ee hoop-yoo move out
  angrily he spurred his horse into the
treachery of snow-masked rocks to head
this bunch off eastward there ought to
be a couple more such rock-rimmed
coves a mile or two para alia that the
fire had probably missed mclardens
horse caught a shod hoof in a jam of
jagged edged rocks the spurs were
prodding him he went down on the
other knee yanked himself free and went
on but now he limped a little and blood
trickled down his leg to blotch red on
the whiteness
  snow started to whip down again
now out of the northeast it was all
mclarden could do to keep the uneasy
cattle angling across the edgy slant of
it
  by the time he reached the rock rim
coves his horse was limping badly his
own toes were tingling with cold the
storm came slicing down like a cold
steel knife of the four coves he counted
on only one had escaped the fire and
out of it came a drift of cattle no
grass left
  yonder two hundred yards away ran
the zigzag of elbow creek cutting its
curves so that the creek was first on one
side and then the other stretched a stiff
line of sturdy six-wire fence unneigh-
borly but efficient barrier between
the pryor and doucette ranges mc-
larden circled the cattle and rode to a

adventure
knoll just short of the creek
  even through the slanting snow he
could see that the flats beyond were not
dead white as they were here they
were spotted thick with brownish blobs
of bunch-grass jn places even the
gramma showed up through the snow
mclarden knew these flats part of old
doucettes reserve which thanks to
good seasons he had not grazed at all
for two or three years
  often enough mclarden had joined
the pryor cowboys in contemptuous
comment on a cattleman so cautious
that he would waste good grazing like
that year after year saving it against a
day of need that like as not would never
come
  it took some time to get a span of
that sturdy fence down without tools
flattened so that cattle would cross it
by the time he had it ready there was
not a cow in sight mclarden overtook
them drifting in straggling strings be-
fore the storm half a mile back south-
westward
  hee-yi-ee hoop-ee-yah
  savagely he slashed the doubled rope
end across the snouts of the leaders
fighting them back sullenly snail-like
they turned in a scattering motte of
charred scrub juniper he left them on
the way back to his pack-horse at the
sacaton gate he walked and rode by
turns his bay was limping billy now
the walking warmed his feet but he
hated it none the less the well-booted
feet of horseback men grow tender after
years of little walking
  mclarden reckoned it well past noon
when he reached his pack-horse standing
tail to the wind shivering
  tough aint it bugsy
  the horse nickered anxiously
  mclarden found a lone juniper be-
side some boulders that offered a little
shelter from the steady drive of wind
and snow there he dumped his pack
he shifted the saddle to bugsy rig-
ging a bedroll blanket on the sweaty bay
poured him a scanty feed of oats and
left him staked there to the juniper
  he had to use the spurs freely to force
bugsby back northeastward again in
the face of the storm but drifter mc-
larden was stubborn headin south-
ward yeah-but he aimed to see them
hungry cows  grass first old douc-
ette had grass to rent didnt he well
then damn him now he had it rented
even if he didnt know it damn little
hungry cattle knew or cared about grass-
rent terms or neighborly enmity what
they wanted was grass let the old man
and frenchy doucette come to terms as
they might see fit later
  the seventy-odd head of pryor cattle
taking hungrily to frenchy doucettes
old grass didnt pause to thank the tired
rawfaced sweat-chilled cowboy who
paused to roll a smoke as the last strag-
gler came out east of elbow creek mc-
lardens chilled fingers shook spilling
half of the tobacco but his face wore a
grim cold-stiffened smile as he turned
back again across the down fence he
put the spurs to bugsy the thickening
grayness told him that night was not far
off
  two hundred yards away he reined up
suddenly listening down the wind
came shouting the whooping of men
trying to drive cattle his ears caught
its spanish flavor frenchy doucettes
cowboys were always mexicans and
probably because they worked for less
he kept a full crew on even through the
winter
  wearily drifter mclarden reined
bugsy around a rough rebellious trot
was the best he could get out of the
horse against that slanting whip of
storm
  the five shouting cursing vaqueros
were not making much headway prying
those cattle loose from old frenchvs
grass they had perhaps a dozen al-
ready choused back across the creek
  mclarden was in the midst of them
before they saw him in the growing
dusk
  oigan compadres the cowboy
summer hand

called out in drawling spanish what
you think youre doing here
  as if at a signal the five left off chous-
ing cattle and circled him waving their
tree hands excitedly
  threateningly they wanted to know
who the hell turned these pryor cattle
onto their bosss grass
  i did said drifter mclarden and
what about it
  he saw that they were all tricked out
in their go-yonder clothes heading
back to the ranch from a fiesta session
at their placita evidently they had just
happened upon these cattle probably
they were still a little drunk
 you eh by god hombre- began
the chunky one called paco sisneros
  wup here mclardens voice cut in
sharply hold it
 the cowboys gun stood out in his
hand the right hand of paco sisneros
stopped dead half an inch from the butt
of his colt mclarden backed his horse
swiftly out of the circle of them so that
he might have his back to none
  listen here i got no quarrel with
you boys you better leave this business
up to your boss hes goin to rent this
grass to pryor you sabe
  i theenk you lie said one called
toribio sneeringly maybe you come
weeth us an talk to the boss youself
eh
 damn me i will growled mc-
larden but you boys git on home
now an let these cattle be you hear
me
  they looked at his gun and heard him
 mclarden watched them go with a
sigh he holstered his gun and turned
again southwestward he wondered as
he rode if his finger had actually been
too numb to pull the trigger if and
when it might have needed to
drifter mclarden had
planned to spend this night in
the snug comfort of a mexi-
can adobe village well down
toward the valley he spent it instead
in the lee of tarp and boulder without
sleep nursing green juniper branches in-
to smoky fire lest the snow-laden zero
wind chill through to his bones the cold
biscuits and meat he had brought for
yesterdays nooning served him now for
supper and breakfast as well
  at dawn the sky was clear again
aching blue with the cold he saddled
bugsy packed the lame bay they
traveled slowly plodding a full two feet
of snow again northeastward five or six
miles it would be to frenchy doucettes
ranch house
  the sun rose dazzling bright but with
little warmth these uplands lay glit-
tering in the white grasp of implacable
cold he crossed elbow creek where
yesterday he had driven the cattle on
solid ice the cattle were still there
scattered about backs humped and
icicled with the snow their body warmth
had melted but their flanks were
rounded now from well-filled paunches
and even yet some bunch grass tops
showed up through the snow on such
a range they could always make out
to eat as quick as he could see old
frenchy and make some deal with him
the rest of pryors herds could be
shoved across here too and fare as well
  he saw frenchy sooner than he ex-
pected half a mile from elbow creek
he met him with four of his vaqueros
coming to shove the pryor cattle from
his range
  mclarden wasted no words on what
terms would doucette rent winter
range for ed pryors cattle
  so the calf comes to the milk after
all eh said frenchy doucette day
before yesterday i have range to rent to
my neighbor he gives me slap in the
face only for you he have killed me
now if i have all the grass in hell the
cattle of ed pryor-let em starve
  vamos hombres shouted paco
sisneros we go to drive them out
  with a swift movement mclarden
squared his horse crosswise in front of
them reckless of the odds his grim

adventure
smile met them steadily above the
cocked  in his hand
  wait a minute doucette he said
lets be reasonable about this
  matalo kill heem shouted the
man called toribio
  mclarden saw five swift vaquero
hands reach for their guns the cornered
coyote may slash down the first dog to
leap at him but a pack of five or six
will get him in the end well if it had
to be so so be it but it might yet be
bluff if not paco would be the first
dog down he saw doucettes frost-
rimmed whiskers quivering his small
eyes bugging out there was a gun at
his thigh today but his hand had not
moved toward it
  paco sisneros brandished his gun in
the air and came charging toward him
still mclarden waited he had no de-
sire to kill if he could help it then
suddenly he realized he had waited too
long it was another of the vaqueros
toribio who was ready to shoot
  mclarden changed his aim his finger
tightened on the trigger
  suddenly like the rush of a tiger the
horse of frenchy doucette leaped for-
ward his rump struck bugsys
shoulder as frenchy swung him around
to collide shoulder against shoulder
with the mount of paco sisneros
  two shots roared out almost at once
mclarden knew his own had missed
and as for toribios-the head of
frenchy doucettes horse had come
into line between mclarden and
the vaqueros gun at the exact instant
of firing the horse went down like an
axed steer even as he fell frenchy
doucette slipped from the saddle and
stood gun in hand spitting out curses
in mixed spanish french and english
  but his humped little back was turned
to drifter mclarden his face and gun
snout to paco and the other vaqueros
  no bon dieu no paco he rasped
stop eet no tiren inas cochons
  whatever ed pryor his cowboys and
the world in general might think of
frenchy doucette his own men obeyed
him now as they would have obeyed
the warning rattle of a diamond-back
as one man they holstered their guns
in the face of his a little shamed now
mclarden followed suit
  meestaire mclardaine said the
little old man gravely i do not forget
that two days ago you save me the life
when i have no gun alors is eet that
the old man pryore send you here
now to put his cows on my grass
no mclarden spoke frankly i
dont give a damn whose they are
frenchy hungry cows have got to eat
thats why im here-why them cattle
is on your grass-and why theyre goin
to stay there you said yourself you
had the grass to spare
  frenchy doucette shrugged
  the cattle of ed pryore he said
to hell weeth them but you-your
nose is blue weeth the cold-at my house
the coffee pot is always hot bien you
come weeth me
  it seemed to mclarden that he could
not remember when he had last tasted
hot coffee but he shook his head
  neverthless when frenchy finally
ordered his men to let the cattle alone
for today mclarden went with them
guest or prisoner he did not know
they rode in silence doucette and one
of his men mounted double another
brought the old mans saddle the
vaqueros eyed mclarden sullenly
  with the first cup of hot steaming
coffee warming his innards drifter
mclarden realized that now he had tied
his own hands when a man saved your
life and you accepted his hospitality
thus you couldnt turn right around
and fight him to hell with hungry
cattle his trail lay southward
  thees beeg grass fire frenchy was
saying because eet was trouble be-
tween us one long damn time ago about
the sheep that i had when i come first
to thees place my neighbor and me are
not friends he hate me maybe i hate
heem too so he theenk i make thees
summer hand

fire in order that i can sell heem the
grass or maybe buy heem the cattle
cheap but it ees not true
  the little mans earnestness was
comical but it was convincing too
  i reckon ol ed knows it aint mc-
larden said he was mad frenchy
mad all the time he ees mad that
one but i dont like that he say thees
thing of me now i am mad too my-
self but i am not hard in the heart
mira meeslaire mclardaine you go
tell the  man pryore thees if he
come here to me and say doucette it
is a lie that i speak when  accuse you
thees fire then by gar the grass i
have to spare i will not sell heem it no
by the saints but for the cows i have
pity to them i will geeve the grass
mclardaine what they need but
first he must come thees orguuoso to
admeet he lie i lend you a fresh horse
you go mclardaine now
  hell said the cowboy if thats
the way the land lays i might as well
head south again im wastin my time
       nevertheless mounted
on one of doucettes ratty
ponies mclarden went he
swung southward to cross el-
bow creek where he had let the fence
down he did not know that he was
followed
  as he came in sight of the bunch
grass flats he reined up suddenly
three riders were jamming the cattle
back across the creek westward
  mclarden rammed in the spurs and
came on as fast as the pony could wal-
low and lunge through the snow
  two of the three riders turned when
they saw him they reined up waiting
hands on their guns
  tugwire harrison muffled up to the
gills took the hand from his gun and
let his tobacco-juicy jaw sag in sur-
prise old man ed pryor stiffened in
the saddle his face was drawn and
blue with the cold his gaze moved
over the ratty doucette pony then to
the face of its rider
  well mclarden he said ridin
with the scrubs eh this your work
he waved his hand toward the cattle
recrossing the down fence
 the blood rushed angrily to mc-
lardens face he had meant to meet
the old man diplomatically but now-
youre damn right it is he said
you damned old fool you want your
cows to starve
  ill git feed for em said ed pryor
  where
  the word seemed to strike the old
man square in the face like a well
driven fist mclarden could see that
it staggered him whatever front he
might put up the old man must know
as well as he that there was no range
to be had and as for hay and cake-ed
pryor could never finance enough of
that to feed straight through a long
hard winter the cattle were hungry
already this first storm
  where
  for once old man pryors eyes failed
to hold their own they wavered
looked away squinting in the glare
  in hell he said and whirled his
horse around he seemed unaware that
mclarden was riding up beside him
  ed said mclarden old frenchy
sends vou word that-
  to hell with him
  a big steer knowing now where grass
was and reluctant to leave it cut back
from the others and came charging back
across the ice of elbow creek the old
man spurred savagely out to head him
on the quick icy turn the steer got past
him as he swerved to follow drifter
mclarden suddenly blocked his path
 hold on a minute ed he said
quietly i want to talk to you
  for once old man pryor held on
drifter mclardens gun was in his hand
and there was a queer hard look in his
eyes pryor stared at him unbelieving-
ly but he stopped just the same
 ed mclarden said with sharp

adventure
soberness im done with monkey-
business  frenchys actin white
about this lie paid you a call the
other day youre coinin with me now
-to return it
  a queer gleam almost of amusement
yet with something of approval in it
too came into the old cowmans eyes
  i aint never budged under gun-
threat yet drifter he said an im
too old to start it now you can put it
up-or shoot as you like
  but his own hand made no move
toward the six-gun at his thigh for a
full minute they sat thus deadlocked
  the tautness of mclardens anger
sagged he was remembering the four
summers he had ridden for this salty old
rannyhan before him-four good sea-
sons of loyalty between them he knew
the old mans stubborn temper but he
had known still more of his kindness
his frank fair-dealing with his hands
off yonder he could hear cattle-the old
mans cattle-bawling as tugwire and
the other cowboy drove the m-
where to starvation yet how many
starving cows would it take to be worth
this stubborn old mans blood
  drifter mclarden holstered his gun
  to hell with it he said
  he whirled his horse around but not
the way he had come cattle doucette
old ed his pack his horse-let them all
be damned drifter mclarden once
again was heading south
  he was suddenly aware of old man
pryors horse along side of him
  ed pryors voice was gruff as he
reached out his hand
  i reckon you meant right drifter
no hard feelins
  none said the cowboy shortly but
he ignored the hand
he tried to shut out the
occasional doleful music of
the bawling of hungry wan-
dering cattle by thinking how
the fluting of blackbirds would sound in
just a few days now down in the valley
he wondered how it would seem to have
warm feet again
  it was a thuddy rattle of shots dulled
by the earths great muffler of snow
that jarred him suddenly back to the
reality of this eold-bitten range they
came from somewhere back  elbow
creek mclarden whirled the ratty
doucette pony around ratty or not he
was a tough piece of horseflesh on the
back-track he traveled the sound of
occasional bursts of shooting kept mc-
lardens spurs to the ponys ribs
  when he had left doucettes that
morning mclarden did not know that
he had been followed at a safe dis-
tance by five of doucettes mexicans
smarting at the recollection of yester-
days run-in with this gringo whom their
bosss intervention had saved
  mclarden had ridden faster than
they thought they came to the bunch-
grass flats after he had gone but they
were out for trouble they had spied
old man pryor and tugwire harrison
after the steer that had broken back to
the doucette range and opened fire
upon them
  drifter mclarden crossed elbow
creek cautiously paused listened the
whitened flats nobbed here and yonder
with rocky upthrusts lay silent nor
from the depression of the creek could
he see the lone rider coming at a strain-
ing lope from the north
  mclarden rode out into the open
  from behind one of the rocky up-
thrusts five hundred yards away burst a
clatter of rifle-fire bullets sputted the
snow a few rods before him from be-
hind another hump farther out beyond
sounded the pow-pow of six-guns and
a shout of warning in the shrill voice of
old tugwire harrison
  swerving away from the rifle fire a
little mclarden put the pony to a lope
so it had come now to bullets
  suddenly from the first rocky-point
fort burst forth two horsemen
quartering to head him off mclarden
saw rifles gleam in their hands he
summer hand

carried none himself only the  he
swerved off a little more but he did
not turn back one of the vaqueros
stopped swung down fired from on foot
the bullets struck closer yet still fell
short old style lead slug s their
range was not long
  then all at once mclarden ceased to
swerve away from behind the other
rocky point appeared a man on foot a
tall man lunging toward the two
vaqueros through the snow his six-gun
roaring as he came it took no second
look to see who it was old man pryor
rushing out to draw their fire away
from him
  grimly mclarden put tie spurs to his
pony heading him straight toward the
two vaqueros with rifles he knew the
range was too great but now he fired
once-twice anyway
  he felt his pony lunge suddenly and
drop struggling into the snow he freed
his feet from the stirrups and plunged
ahead the rifles cracked again he
saw the old man lunge head first into
the snow snow spurted up around
where he had fallen old tugwire and
mayfield were rushing out now too
mclarden yelled to them to keep back
rifles against six-guns-it could be no
use a bullet whopped through the wing
of his chaps another-his right leg
felt queer and numb but he could still
plow ahead
  out yonder in the snow the old man
showed again coming to his feet
  down mclarden yelled damn it
ed keep down
  one of the vaqueros was taking de-
liberate aim now at mclarden the
cowboy turned dived suddenly as far
as he could sidewise into the snow the
shot missed but the vaquero was ready
as mclarden came up again
  suddenly somewhere to the left
northward there rose a shout
  stop eet non non stop eet
  it was not the shout however nor
the booming pow of old ed pryors six-
gun that spoiled toribios next deliber-
ately aimed shot it was a bullet from
the old  carbine of old frenchy
doucette toribios rifle leaped skyward
he spun around and sank into the snow
juan swung to his horse again and used
the spurs toribio got up tried to run-
and fell
  suddenly in spite of himself drifter
mclarden was down in the snow and
could not get up
  old frenchy doucette got to him
first but old man pryor was not far
behind h i s face showed haggard
more with anxiety than pain
  drifter he croaked they-they
git you son
  jest whacked my leg a little i
reckon i heard the shootin an come on
back i didnt want you an frenchy-
bon dieu cried frenchy doucette
through a shaky beard i swear im
told them not to make shooting of
thees im told them not to kill thees
man who-
well damn it you stopped em
didnt you what you howlin about
old man ed pryors voice was gruff
but he was holding out his hand to
frenchy doucette
  mclardens one of mine frenchy
he said simply i seen you down one of
your own men to save him
  drifter mclarden was not too bad
hurt to perceive that old eds hand did
not go ungripped and back of that
sudden handshake he thought he could
see hungry cattle and grass pryor
cattle and doucette bunch-grass show-
ing up through snow for them to graze
  well as soon as this leg got well he
could be heading on southward
  yeah he could but these two ol
tomcats - purring now - somebody
would have to keep them so
  winter riding northers snowy range
cold feet-no blackbirds no coy coyotas
at a friendly cruces boarding house no
cards in a snug saloon-
  to hell with it grunted the drifter
strangely enough he was referring
now to the southward trail

synopsis
it was in the jolly pilots tavern that
tom swayne master mariner met
ben ives bosun on his fathers boat
ives brought tragic news the cath-
erine captain cyrus swayne command-
ing had been captured by the bucca-
neer long-twelve porton off the wind-
ward passage his ship disabled and he
and his crew taken prisoner ives had
been sent back as hostage bearing a de-
mand for ransom
 the times were unsettled trouble
with france had brewed unchecked
privateers bearing letters of marque
from the french government had crip-
pled american shipping tom resolved
not to let his fathers ruin go unpun-
ished
  within a few weeks toms brig the
iris cleared for the mona passage called
the devils graveyard because of french
depredations she was small but tom
had fitted her with a long twenty-four
pound gun rifled and on gimbals with
a range of a mile he bore american
letters of marque and the pick of a
fighting crew eager for a taste of the
spanish main and booty to disguise
his intent and embroil porton with the
french tom renamed his boat the scor-
pion and masqueraded as the pirate
  they sighted a french brig homeward
bound from jacmel and swayne in the
guise of porton made her haul down
her colors the booty six casks of hai-

the scgrpion

tian gold was welcome but the informa-
tion swayne obtained was even more
so for mademoiselle le gai-one of
his prisoners-was a fiancee of the jac-
mel official-mentioned in portons letter
as the man to whom his fathers ransom
must be paid swayne decided to slip
past the french ships guarding the har-
bor release the girl and endeavor to
learn his fathers fate
  jacmel ravaged by insurrection was
heavily fortified but under cover of
darkness swayne landed a boat and re-
stored the girl to her fiance the latter
overwhelmed with gratitude told tom
that portons ship lay at anchor to the
west of the harbor and that porton him-
self had landed that day to confer with
de berrien the military governor
mademoiselle le gai intensely grateful
offered to have tom conveyed safely to
the sea
  the sea will always wait tom said
take me by the most secluded path
to the governors house
  his men crouching close to the french
sentries with the gallows a certainty
if discovered eyed him aghast but they
followed him down the darkened avenue
chapter vi
between two fires
here there msieur is the
house of the general
  etion stopped in the street
and pointed through a maze of ceiba and
mango trees to a dark mass of a house
in a comer of which a light burned
brightly
  keeping well to the shaded line of the
walk tom moved up the drive he
halted when his quick ears caught the
shuffle of shod feet and the unmistak-
able clank of a musket then a sentry
loomed against the light of the hall he
could see his headgear silhouetted against
the candles the room at the corner of
the house was brightly lighted and he
could see the figure of a man leaning
over a desk littered with papers he
turned to etion
take a good look etion he whis-
pered is that the military governor
etion nodded tom drew him further
back into the shadows and motioned to
his men to close up
  look here etion he said gruffly
were americans at war with france
youre a negro and a servant to a
french lady where do you stand in
this are you for us or against us
etion looked at him and his face
twisted in a grimace
  listen capn he said i help etion

ask me were i stan long as you mak

  that settles it said tom his men
who had been listening wide-eyed closed
up a little how can we get rid of that
sentry muttered tom
  etion came to life
  i know dis place he said ony
one soldier here at one time i tend to
soldier he ees franch frenchman help
porton all same as porton you watch
he slunk back into the shadows and
they waited a moment later tom saw a
shadow drifting from bush to bush it
merged with the trunk of a great ceiba
tree
  the sentry moved along his beat hum-
ming a little song with jacmel in
french hands and a heavy force of in-

adventure
fantry in the redoubts he knew that all
was safe he paced to the end of his
beat turned while he still hung on his
heels a shadow leaped from the black-
ness tom saw what looked like long
tentacles of blackness wrap about the
sentrys neck as etions skinny arms as
strong as steel choked the man into
unconsciousness he dropped like a dead
man and etion seemed to swarm all
over him the next minute black sprang
to help him between them they man-
aged to tie the man with his own gun-
sling and to gag him with his shirt
they laid him in an inert mass under
a bush and came back to tom
  black you come with me you oth-
ers stay here
within the house the man
still bent over his papers as
the inner door of the room
swung quietly open the man
glanced up to see two white men-and a
pistol-muzzle not five feet from his face
  general alphonse de berrien mili-
tary governor of haiti leaped to his
feet with a choking cry that passed into
a throaty gurgle as tom spoke
  stand still    his pistol hand
spoke a language that needed  trans-
lation with bulging eyes the general
rose silently his eyes fastened on tom
as a bird eyes a snake tom motioned to
etion at his heels
  ask him if he speaks english he
said
  etion jabbered excitedly and turned
 e say a leetle suh
  tell him i am the captain of the
american privateer scorpion and he is
my prisoner black tie the mans hands
behind him with that curtain cord tie
him tightly so he cant get loose if he
resists knock him over
black snatched a curtain cord from
a window and lashed the trembling mans
hands behind him at a nod from tom
he tied a handkerchief about his jaws
general de berrien read his fate if he
resisted he knew better than to strug-
gle but his eyes bulged and his breath-
ing was stertorous as tom hurled him
into a chair and turned to black
  ill have a look at his desk i cant
read much french but i can read it
better n i can speak it i can read a
ships manifest i reckon
  i kin read french pretty good sir 
black surrendered his prisoner to etion
and slouched forward taking the papers
these here sir are french assignats
paper money it aint worth a damn
just promises to pay sometime these
frogs are long on promises and short on
payin when the time comes these
here- he shuffled some blank forms-
seem to be blank commissions for let-
ters of marque to be give to ships to
turn em into privateers etions tryin
to talk to you sir
   is man said etion in a low voice
he say e ees prisoner of war suh he
say gib him treatment due his rank e
say he ees military governor of haiti an
you are crazy mans
  tom grinned hes in one hell of a
fix for a military governor so hes the
man who can turn a pirate into a pri-
vateer huh well it just happens that
hes the man i want bring him along
black hang on to him no matter what
happens come on lets get back to
the boat
  with a pistol muzzle in the small of
his back general de berrien moved
swiftly the other men joined them at
the stair-foot and they crept along the
dark street from time to time the door
of a tavern opened and laughter and
singing drifted out to them once a shot
made the party pause then an outburst
of musketry from a distant redoubt
crashed like thunder as they passed an
open door their prisoner struggled vio-
lently as though he knew this was his
last chance of escape but black tripped
him and tom dragged him to his feet
  down this street i think he said
the beach cant be far
the scorpion

  all streets led to the beach that was
a common street for all jacmel there
was no permanent guard on that beach
nor any need for one soldiers held each
end and the escaped slaves had no boats
in any case a party small enough to
land undetected would be too small to
cause much damage
  baker turned into a broad path that
led past an inn and was hurrying along
the dark road when the unexpected hap-
pened the tavern door flung suddenly
open and the streaming lamp-light out-
lined the americans and the figure of
general de berrien his hands tied being
harried along by the raiders at that
moment the prisoner who had managed
to free his jaws of the gag raised his
voice in a shrill cry
  a moi he shouted a moi mes
soldats
  for a brief second silence gripped the
crowd inside the tavern then two men
surged into the street a sharp oath
was followed by a rush of stamping feet
and by the ring of steel
  to the boat men toms voice rang
out above the noises of the crowd run
-and keep the man hold him
  they broke into a run tom seized
the prisoner and hurled him forward
he struggled in vain against black and
baker as they hustled him to the beach
where the sea-flattened sands gave firm
footing the boat on the shingle showed
a long black blot against the water a
sudden hail came to them as the boat-
guard came to life
  who in hell is that demanded a
man that was gwynns reckless shout
  shove off into deep water an stand
by
 the bow-man promptly shoved the
boat off the beach and the oars thumped
in the thole-pins
 port-oar give way there way
enough back-water to starboard back
her against the swell an keep her nose
to the beach
  a sudden spit of musket-fire tore the
night the pursuers increased by sol-
diers from taverns and by the beach
patrol returned from its rounds hur-
ried along the wake of the running amer-
icans toms men had a pistol each
the crowd had muskets and bayonets
one volley would settle the matter sud-
denly a shrill command cut the uproar
  fire it said fire you petrified
camels give fire
  some one kicked open a lantern
jerked out the candle and set fire to
some dried beech-grass that flamed and
roared with a fine crackle two muskets
crashed
  as though those shots were a signal
a wild yell broke out in the night and
a sudden wave of half-crazy men burst
on the startled group desperate men
driven half crazy by the memory of
their wrongs drove down upon the
startled soldiery one soldier had a brief
view of that wave he turned to run
with a wild yell
  les negres he shouted in shrill-ac-
cented terror the wild negroes of the
hills are on us fire men fire
there was time for neither words nor
explanation no man needed to be told
what had happened if that crowd of
negroes overcame them every man in
that crowd knew what it meant it
meant a death of unbelievable torture
  for a brief second they stood ap-
palled then some one had sense enough
to direct a volley a score of muskets
flashed and roared in the melee tom and
his men turned and hurried for the
shoreline and almost hurled their pris-
oner at the boat
  the incredible had happened the
wild negroes had done what they had
never dared do before they had raided
the french lines
quin at bow stood on no
ceremony he reached out
with his eight-foot boat-hook
inserted the hook between
collar and neck of the breathless pri

adventure
oner and pulled and alphonse de
berrien came like a netted land-crab
while tom with baker and black and
little etion fought and struggled with
the spume of the black wave that fought
madly to kill any white man les
blancs had no friends in haiti any more
than they have today
  the wave surged forward with yelps
and shouts and jacmel woke in terror
the loud shrill rattle of the french
drums turned out startled troops shrill
bugles yelped for aid and were answered
from the dark jungle by the deep roar
and throb of the great raba voodoo
drums from the distant hills where
flares of red fire lit the sky too late
the french commander of the city guard
realized his mistake fever dysentery
and debaucheries had loosed bonds of
discipline they could not be tightened
suddenly
  fortunately the wild men had no idea
oi how general was the terror they
had not planned a real attack it was
just a raid for arms they were armed
with rude pikes made by plantation
smiths with a few stolen pistols and
fowling pieces-mostly with cane-knives
made in connecticut and reshaped by
savage labor-but those weapons were
deadly in the darkness
  the mob filled the fosse they drove
back overpowered guards and snatched
muskets from their nerveless hands
they turned the captured bayonets on
the french and cut down a patrol to
the last man while french drums shrilled
and rattled the alarm and the city
poured out to their defense
  the attackers knew their limitations
they could not hope to hold or loot
the place against organized french sol-
diery that might come later but
they had put the fear of god into french
hearts that night a series of shrill
yells recalled the wariest and the ends
of the half-moon of fighters drew quickly
back seeking the cover of the jungle
before the frigates in the harbor could
open fire the line drew swiftly back
and the men at the end on the beach
were suddenly aware of tom and his
men struggling to get their prisoner
into the boat they knew they must
get him off to the schooner before those
heavy french frigates could learn of the
scorpions arrival
  all white men were alike to that
frenzied crowd the french republic
that had promised freedom while it
kept them in slavery could not be
trusted all white men were foes there
were in that crowd men freshly brought
from africa who held life cheap and
well paid for if in dying they could
kill even one of their foes here were
white men before them
  the pebbled beach supplied them with
ammunition in a second a hundred
rocks rattled against the boat and
splashed in the water de berrien went
down a-sprawl black fell headlong
stunned by a great rock quin jerked
both men into the boat and dropped
with a scalp-wound from a flung cane-
knife he scrambled to his feet and
reached a hand to tom who was stag-
gering knee-deep through the water un-
der the impact of a stone that sent him
stumbling then a light surge of surf
drove the boat beachward in another
moment she would beach and be
swamped by the crowd of fighting
negroes and every man murdered
  americans shouted quin desper-
ately we are americans i tell you we
are not french we are americans
  but he had better have held his
breath a hundred blacks surged across
the beach then a man recognized de
berrien the sight of him was like the
sight of a fox to dogs tom staggered
to the boats stem and set his shoulder
to it
  shove off into deep water he
shouted above the roar of the sea and
the crazy yells of the mob theyll
swamp you give a hand here
  the boat gave way slowly and slid
the scorpion

inch by inch across the sand then as
tom set his foot on the sharp edge of
coral a rock as big as an orange struck
him full on the back of the head he
plunged forward and fell face-down in
the shallow water his last thrust sent
the rocking boat off the beach
 tom swayne never knew how long
he lay in the water nor how he ever
got out of it he seemed to have been
thrust through with sharp blades each
breath that he drew seemed to pierce
him anew two men picked him up by
both arms and rushed him along the
jungle trail behind the mass of the
jubilant retreating negroes they had
killed a dozen men they had overcome
a strong patrol they had fired several
houses they had even carried one of
the batteries and had spiked its guns
with nails brought for that purpose
behind them the delirious rattle of the
infantry drums continued to sound the
alarm
  finally his captors set tom down he
strove to rise but his feet seemed
weighted with lead heavy brush
scratched his face he fell like a sack of
sand the next thing he knew a light
was shining in his face and etion was
bending over him
  capn he whispered there was no
mistaking that slurring speech that
etion had picked up in the distant
carolinas capn is yo daid
 huh tom struggled to a sitting
posture and drew a shuddering breath
some negroes had lighted a fire by its
smoky light he saw the motley crew
almost all were naked to the waist some
were striped with red and yellow ochre
or barred with paint and blood some
were wounded and the dried blood had
caked and dried on their wounds most
of them were crazy drunk or on the way
to become so some on the rum found in
every french canteen but most with
success the headiest wine of all a black
giant in the blue-and-gold coat of a
french commissary of customs waving
a naked cane-knife drove the others
aside with frenzied yells through the
graying dawn that filtered through the
jungle toms fevered brain heard the
drums their throbbing beat was like
the pulsations of a fevered brain the
black giant snatched etion aside and
shrieked at him etion shrinking aside
answered shrilly tom heard the words
even his slight knowledge of french told
him their meaning
  no he said hotly waving both
hands no not french american
chaos broke out anew and then came
coma
chapter vii
the torture bowl
a singing insect hum
greeted his return to conscious-
ness his head ached his
mouth was as dry as a lime-
kiln every limb was stiff and sore full
realization came as etion bent over
him he sat up and swore
  where in hell are we he asked
etion shook his head and nodded at
the door it was open and tom could
see outside then he glanced about and
his face changed the room was about
ten feet square and was walled with al-
most solid masonry a thatched roof
overhead rustled and moved as tiny
house-lizards ran to and fro through
the open plank door he caught oc-
casional glimpses of a sentry musket
on shoulder the sentry was as black
as erebus and was clad in leather
breeches blood-stained a dirty shirt
and a torn straw hat his bare feet pad-
ded like a monkeys as he walked before
the house
  etion said grimly they are my own
people capn they are slaves at ran
away from the french
  then we have no cause to worry
said tom were not french
all whites are the same to them said

adventure
etion here they come we will see
what they mean to do with us
  two men entered the room without
a word to either prisoner they took a
long table carried it outside and set it
under a giant tree a crowd of men at
once surged up to it and stood waiting
  toms eager eyes scanned that crowd
he was more or less accustomed to see
leaves in his own land but these were
utterly different from any he had ever
s en slaves were there who had been
scarred by lash and branding irons
half-naked men wholly desperate by
french cruelties their faces showed
bestial elation at their success they
had decimated a french patrol they
had burned some houses they had cap-
tured a considerable quantity of arms
most satisfactory of all they had taken
some prisoners on whom they could
wreak their hate their excited jabber
came to tom on a gale that reeked of
sweat and blood and dust
  a giant negro shouted for silence
his voice sounded like the inarticulate
howl of a bayed beast but tom could
distinguish every word
  bring the prisoners here
 tom set his teeth no white man
had a chance with these people know-
ing something of french and spanish
cruelties to slaves he could not wholly
blame these men but he realized that
his own condition was desperate
  four men armed with short pikes and
cane-knives broke into a run they
passed toms open door and he won-
dered vaguely what had happened then
a muffled shout broke the hush and the
men came urging a white man at the
points of their pikes his hands were
lashed behind his back his blue sailors
jacket was torn from collar to skirt and
his face was a mask of half-dried blood
at sight of him etion snatched at tom
  porton he hissed he shook from
head to foot
  what youre crazy etion tom
jerked the man to his feet porton the
pirate-that
  etion fairly babbled why wouldnt
i know im didnt f tell you how he
taken my daughter no man forgets at
suh i see him three two times when i
workin as boy for maamnelle ees man
porton come see monsieur le clave too
look capn-
  but toms eyes were on the man
could etion be right was this indeed
porton long-twelve porton for whom
ships scoured the seven seas whose name
was known for cruelty from port o
spain to cap llaytien
  even among big men porton would
have been classed as huge men any-
where would have called him handsome
but for his cruel mouth and a sinister
sort of glare in his blue-gray eyes tom
eyed him fascinatedly and wondered
how had porton been takeu prisoner by
these escaped slaves etions excited
jabber sounded loud to him
  look capn he almost shouted
see at big man i know im too he
pointed to the black leader who was
almost as huge as porton  at mans
name jorveaux one time he slave to
le compte de tours e handle small
canoes fo de fishin for the count one
tim de count not like wat jorveaux
do an he whip him good wid whip made
of thorns an brand him too dem scars

de count come back an find house gone
an his wife killed dey say at jor-
veauxs wok i not sure bout at though
look suh
tom could not help looking
the sun stood well above the
wall of the jungle the big
man porton his hands fast
found was being urged forward at four
bloody pike-points the centre of a
surging shouting mass of half-crazy
bloodthirsty blacks toms tongue licked
the sticky line of his dry lips
the scorpion

  jorveauxs voice boomed out every
word was clearly audible
 two months ago your ship beached
on the barrier reef off simone river
the french were after you to hang you
and all your men we helped you our
men took out your cargo careened your
ship and helped you in every way when
you repaired it your men lived ashore
with us they eat our food they drank
our rum they took our women but
because we hated the french even worse
than you did we helped you we re-
loaded your ship and not even an iron
bolt was lost in return for that you
promised to bring us a cargo of arms
that we were to buy from you with
french gold we got your water-butts
filled and you put to sea then  
  jorveaux struggled hard for self-con-
trol and a little white foam lay in the
corners of his mouth as he worked him-
self into a fury his men knew that
mood and backed away from him but
the four pike-men prodded porton
closer
  then our enemies the french of-
fered you aid said jorveaux how do
i know you fool we have agents in
every house where the french have
black servants or where french officers
take black or brown mistresses we know
all that takes place if a frenchman
itches we know where four days ago
your ship dropped anchor in the har-
bor and you offered to sell to the
frenchman the arms that you promised
us
  hold on   porton struggled hard
to free his arms but the bejuce vines
that bound them held like iron great
sweat drops ran down his face the
first thing i knew those two damned
frigates were anchored alongside me
either one could blow me out of the
water some of my men disclosed the
fact that i had arms and powder under
hatches the military governor threat-
ened me if i did not let him have the
arms thats all there was to it jor-
veaux i tell you i had no choice
  he strained against the bejuce vines
wet by sweat and worn a little by sud-
den chafing that vine gave a little a
jerk and his hands were free with a
quick swing he gathered two pike-mcn
into his arms and swept them together
till their heads cracked like a land-crab
suddenly stepped on he flung both
men aside and snatched at a falling pike
  the crowd sucked suddenly back like
poplars in a wind instinctive fear of a
white man gripped them for a brief
moment in that moment portons pike
went home in the soft tissues of a mans
belly and he fell with a half-moan half-
shriek as porton broke for the safety
of the jungle
  but the jungle was fifty yards away
and the crowd was on his heels like
hounds after a fox a pike flung straight
between his legs tripped him he fell
heavily and a dozen men hurled them-
selves on him they jerked him to his
feet naked to the waist dragged him
back to where jorveaux stood by the
table he was breathing hard and his
eyes were stony
  taladrohe said shortly
  a sudden yell went up from the crowd
the word meant nothing to
tom but etion caught his
breath in a sob as a half-dozen
men dragged porton across the
table spread-eagled him upon it and
lashed his hands and feet to the frame
then they passed other ropes and vines
about his body until he was almost
swathed in ropes tom could see his
great hairy chest rising and falling
tempestuously as he fought for a full
breath at a word from jorveaux two
men quickly brought a scoopful of live
embers from a fire while two other men
hunted along the edge of the jungle
till they found a tree that seemed to suit
them they came back presently with

adventure
a calabash that they set on the table by
portons head
  lashed fast to the table frame by
hands and feet swathed by ropes and
bejuce vines porton could barely move
the sun-glare in toms eyes blinded him
but he managed to see a man snatch the
ragged shirt from portons chest then
another man seized the calabash turned
it upside down and swiftly removed the
shell another man adjusted in its place
a little brass bowl on the upturned bot-
tom of which a man laid a few live em-
bers then all stood back to await de-
velopments
  the eyes of the now silent crowd cen-
tered on the bound porton helpless he
lay motionless save for the heaving of
his chest tom turned to etion
  what the devil he asked are
they waiting for
  taladro said etion shivering
  you said that before said tom
that doesnt tell me much whats
taladro mean
  taladro said etion again as though
that explained all  at man jorveaux
e been onetime slave in porto rico
capn e know taladro e borer wat
bore in wood big beetle capn e
borer etiftn made a twisting boring
motion with his hands that left nothing
to the imagination dem men wat went
to tree caught borers dey come back
an put taladros on at man porton an
cover em up wid at brass cup n en
dey put hot fire on bottom of bowl
borers try to get away from fire no
way can get away ceptin they eat out
through porton him eat quick through
live flesh
  good god said tom and turned
sick as a shriek of agony from porton
rang out above the yells then another
shriek and scream on scream as the
taladro took hold and tried to escape
from his heating prison by gnawing his
way through living tissues the giant
frame of the pirate surged and swelled
against his bonds but they would not
give finally at a signal from jorveax
a man raised the brass bowl and jor-
veax stepped close to his victim
  if you can not endure one taladro
how will you stand five he asked in
two hours they can eat through a foot of
solid timber the next will be placed
over your heart it will be a very slow
death and not pleasant if you die by
it it will be your own choice if you
will carry out my orders all may yet be
well with you will you get for me the
arms and the powder
  porton struggled for speech but words
did not come he nodded heavily and a
flake of heavy spume blew from his
mouth his breath came sobbingly and
his chest rose and fell like a broken bel-
lows jorveaux eyed him closely
  cut him loose he said he will
do what i ask but there is yet pay-
ment to be made for the man lie killed
two men cut porton loose and tom
saw a long red welt on his chest and
twin trickles of blood that ran slowly
down his torso
  rum said jorveaux shortly
  a man held a coconut dipper of rum
to portons lips he drank noisily as a
horse drinks and dropped back on the
table
  now about those arms and the pow-
der said jorveaux where are they
on the bristol belle panted porton
you know the french gave me letters
of marque that makes me safe in a
french port i came into port with my
cargo of arms i took those arms from
a spanish ship and came into port to
get them to you as best i could some
of my men got drunk and talked too
much they boasted of havin taken the
spanish ship so the french learned about
it the next thing i knew two of their
damned frigates anchored by me i cant
move without their knowin it the
french military governor sent for me
and told me they would take the arms
and powder at their own price thats
all
tfernt-
  i think we need some taladros said
jorveaux briefly you tell me but
half the truth i knew last night that
you were to meet the military governor
that was why we raided the french
lines not to get a few guns but to
get    you my friend you are worth
many guns to me do we get the arms
porton nodded briefly you get em
if i can make it but im damned if i
see how i can get em to you
  let him get up said jorveaux
porton struggled to his
feet a hideous figure even in
that furnace-like heat he shiv-
ered but his odd eyes glared at
his captors with the hate and fear of a
trapped wolf
i will get back at once to my ship
he panted brokenly ill have to figure
some way to get the arms to you i
will take my ship out if i have to fight
both french frigates
jorveaux laughed i was field over-
seer for le compte de tours he said
i learned there to trust no man you
will remain in my hands he motioned
to a man who came forward with a six-
foot cross-cut saw that bent in his grip
i have writing materials here for this
very purpose you will write a letter
to your lieutenant and you will direct
him to bring your ship to anchor in
saone bay
  the french will never let him leave
his anchorage said porton desperately
that will be unfortunate for you
said jorveaux grimly see- he
pointed to the cross-cut saw i give
you a week if at the end of one week
your ship is not at anchor in saone bay
i will saw off one of your feet and send
it to the french lines the week after


adventure
that the other foot will go after that
i will send four inches at a time
  t-i will write the letter said por-
ton grimly
  at a nod from jorveax a man brought
paper and ink and some quill pens from
a house among the bamboos and laid
them before porton he seized a pen
and drove it squealing across the paper
when it was done jorveaux took it gin-
gerly and examined it
  if you lied to me he said you
will pay
 hold on a minute said porton
frantically if my ship is beached on
the reefs i am ruined she will be lost
with all hands i cant lose my crew
she carries over a hundred men   
i promise you your life but only
you said jorveaux and his eyes hard-
ened
  here thought tom ill see what
sort of a man he is he will never sac-
rifice his men
  she will be lost with all hands said
porton again
  i will see that she is said jorveaux
quietly you alone are being given a
chance to escape if you had not killed
that man your crew would have been
spared perhaps
  porton showed his relief he dared
not explain that his great fear had been
that some man of that crew might es-
cape every man in that crew knew
of the hidden loot on el cubil though
no man knew the soundings of the chan-
nel that led to the only anchorage he
had the soundings of the channel that
led to the only anchorage he had too
much buried loot on el cubil to take a
chance
  send the letter he said hoarsely
clay muttered tom an damned
rotten clay too sacrifices his whole
crew to save his dirty hide
 jorveaux pouched the letter and
turned to his men
  guard this man carefully he said
put him in the stone house with the
  others and place two sentries at the
door
  porton was dragged away by a half
dozen men tom was still staring out
into the blinding sunlight when they
bulked in the doorway at sight of them
etion came to life
  it ees our turn now capn he mut-
tered
chapter viii
blood o the buccaneers
  one glance at that group
told tom his danger the
bloodlust was on them and
they surged across the clear-
ing shouting and shrieking a man
brought from the house a buckct of
rum they drank it like water then
surged over to surround tom and etion
as they were dragged before jorveaux
tom called to etion sharply
  tell him that a mistake has been
made about us he said tell him that
we are not enemies we are at war with
the french as he is
  but etion paid no attention to him
his quick eyes had seen a little canvas
wallet that had fallen from portons
shirt when he was stretched on the table
while his eyes focused on jorveaux his
questing feet slowly worked the wallet
aside it passed unseen simply because
the crowd was so interested in the tor-
ture of the taladro that they had no
attention for lesser things
  talk to im capn said etion i
mus get this it blong to at man
porton
  tom glanced quickly about him he
had no idea what ferment was at work
in etions head but he felt sure he must
have a reason for what he did he must
distract the attention of that crowd
long enough to let etion get that wallet
  listen    he stepped forward
faced jorveaux with upraised hand
french guns you fools he shouted
listen and as though done by his
the scorpion

own hands a sudden long crash sounded
through the jungle
  the crash was heaven sent every
man leaped aside and sprang for cover
some snatched cane-knives and pikes
a few grabbed muskets they stood quiv-
ering waiting for orders jorveaux
realized that they were on edge stam-
pede would come next he seized a pike-
man and threw him almost across the
clearing
  quiet he shouted have you never
heard a tree split before it was only a
capilan tree you know how they split
  they looked at each other and drifted
back to the table where etion stood
erect tom glanced at him then at the
ground at his feet that moment had
been enough then jorveaux turned on
him a black fury
  you say you are americans he
roared all white men are alike to us
this day white men brought us out of
africa from guinea and sold us into
slavery white men
  dont be a fool    tom flung a
yelling pike-man aside and faced jor-
veaux every man who is a slave here
was a slave in africa before you only
changed a worse slavery for this i tell
you we are americans if you are ene-
mies of the french so are we i came
here to fight the french you say you
want arms ill get them for you my
men are better fighters than yours
they have better arms last night with
three men i captured the military gov-
ernor he is now on my ship off the
coast as we were getting back to my
boat your men mistook us for the french
and took me and my man prisoners
while we were putting de berrien on
board my boat
  jorveaux wavered the facts known
to him bore out what this white man
said but he did not choose to trust any
white man then etion spoke tie jab-
bered excitedly with frenzied gestures
and almost foamed at the mouth jor-
veaux asked
  how does it happen that you a black
man a papaloi of our own people are
with this man
  i am free    etion drew himself
up with dignity i am as free as agoue
god of the sea i serve this white man
for two reasons listen jorveaux i
know all you are and have been you
know who i am and why and how i
hate the french i tell you that other
white man porton is a thief and a mur-
derer he has already killed one of
your men
  he shall pay for that when we have
got his powder and arms snarled jor-
veaux then he turned to tom if
i set you free will you give me de ber-
rien
  what do you want him for
  to be sawed into inches said jor-
veaux fiercely he had my two sons
shot last month as rebels will you give
him to me
  no said tom coolly the man is
my prisoner i too need arms and pow-
der to fight the french and the french
must supply them
  then get the arms that porton has
and bring them to me do that and i
will give you   
  porton asked tom
  jorveaux laughed
  if i free you he said will you
make de berrien free portons ship so
that the arms can be landed where i
can get them
  tom hesitated a moment his account
lay with porton porton had robbed his
father on the high seas and had mur-
dered young sykes porton must pay
but if porton was left in the hands of
these savages he would be tortured to
death he had already seen what they
would do no white man could con-
nive at torture even for a porton he
meant to settle his account with porton
but he must do it in his own way
  i must have time to think it over
he said dully give me time
jorveaux stared at him he could not

adventure
understand this delay he motioned to
his men
  put these in the old stone house with
porton he said he turned to tom
you have till morning to decide if you
meet my demands i will free you and
help you if you refuse you and porton
shall die the same death you know
what that will be
  the men seized both tom and etion
and hustled them into the little hut
then the heavy plank door slammed
shut behind them
for a moment the cool dark-
ness was like a wet bandage
to toms aching eyes then
things took form in the dusk
a low groan made him glance hastily
about him that was porton iron-
nerved though the man was he had col-
lapsed after his experience he lay in
a huddle in a corner of the room his
arms wide his face smeared with sweat
and blood his wide eyes staring at tom
and etion
  who the bloody ell are you he
demanded hotly
  an american said tom they
tell me youre the famous long-twelve
porton
  the ell they do yus im porton
youve eard o me huh im a damned
fool if i wasnt id never ha been took
like this whore you one o that
man jorveauxs spies maybe
  huh damned likely aint it if
you want to know i own the iris
schooner    he gave the scorpion
her old name ive been doin a bit of
tradin among the islands

in in by day an out by night with a

fort right now youre after west injy
produce-coffee an sugar an indigo-
an gittin ten prices fer em in french

tom could hardly conceal his disgust
but he had much to learn from porton
maybe i was lookin for you porton
dont you need a partner two ships

you need in your business is a small
schooner like mine if id scouted the
harbor for you before you entered it
theyd never have got you four between

er like mine she could hang on the
spanish flanks and keep tabs on their
ships sailin theyve got silver and gold
shipments to be picked up this war
in europe has sent up all prices too
see it can be done for a price
  i see pilot fish fer a shark eh said
porton grinning if we was clear o

lieve for one minute that the french
in jacmel will ever let your ship leave

ton they gave me letters of marque

ten they call him english as i am

when we ve dropped the land is no-
bodys business but ourn sometimes
battens a peaceful trader what one
of us learns the other follers up see
midnight deep-sea meetins with word
o good pickins and where its at now
not long ago i picked up a yankee bark
carryin an englishman an his daughter
as passengers to york the damned fool
of a yankee had swapped his guns to
the french fer coffee most of em and
the rest was so covered with his cargo
that he couldnt fight lie give us one
gun and we boarded him
  well    toms breath almost
stopped he knew suddenly that he
was hearing the story of the taking of
his fathers bark the catherine what
happened after that lie asked
  his crew jined me said porton
casually all but one did there was
a damned bull-headed boy name o
sykes who wouldnt jine he was so
damned keerless that he went an fell
overboard hed got his feet mixed up
with some round shot an two of em
stuck to his heels he never come up
there was a girl too    
  what became of her tom fought
down a wild desire to choke the life out
of porton and waited
  ive got the girl safe enough
chuckled porton with a leer an by
god im aimin to keep her im askin
a ransom in gold and ships supplies
but when its paid i wouldnt be sur-
prised if the girl was to git lost an stay
behind with me heilman anne bonny
an mary head wasnt the only women
who ever sailed on the account ruth
derwents no better  them  reckon
tiie door crashed open and a
man set a small bucket of rum
inside the sill then the door
shut again porton shuffled
over to the bucket drank and grinned
  blood o the buccaneers this is
he said we ii do yet
  he swigged off a second drink and
went back to his corner in ten minutes
he was off in a sleep begotten of rum and
fear and pain etion rose and bent over
him then touched toms arm and held
out to him the little canvas wallet that
he had found outside the hut
  at man porton drap is capn he
whispered i got him now
  what the devil did you want it
for demanded tom
  etion looked astounded
  how can make ouanga widout thing
that blong man he asked to make
strong ouanga must have some thing
that blong man mus be touched wid
sweat an blood you not know ouanga
captain
  im damned if t do
  ouanga ees debbil charm quoth
etion maybe you want put curse 
man you get some ting blong him take
hairs from his head an beard dey
work for sure blood better still give
to papaloi an papaloi make oxuinga
tom laughed he remembered hav-

adventure
ing heard old ben ives and his father
tell of the unbelievable things done by
the negro papaloi the medicine men in
the back-country in haiti he did not
believe it of course but he felt that
he must placate old etion who did be-
lieve he took the canvas wallet from
etion and opened it it was a roughly
made sort of a pocket-book with two
inside pockets that were stuffed with
papers he turned it over listlessly he
was not interested in it though etion
had considered it so important his mind
was on other things god if he only had
this devil porton where he could exact
full payment tom did not especially
care about portons crimes against so-
ciety he was concerned with his offenses
against the house of swayne that he had
robbed and against the boy whom he
had murdered he meant to call por-
ton to account for that if he could
only catch porton on blue water porton
in his accursed bristol slut-and he
tom in the scorpion well to wind-
ward 
  ill get him yet he muttered if
he ever draws clear of this lee shore ill
work him up like a bale of spun yarn-
hello whats this
  it was a many-folded crackling paper
that fell from the wallet as he turned
it over and over in his hands he picked
it up and examined it it was a rough
sketch drawn on heavy watered paper
backed with yellow linen and stained by
sweat and use as he unfolded it a
few words stood out plainly
anchorage of el cubil
  tom let go a gusty oath and etion
started
 look here tom pointed to the
sketch this is better than any ouanga
etion this is a map that tells us how
to get to his hiding place where he has
his prisoners and his loot itll take me
to el cubil if we ever get back to the
scorpion
  easy do that said etion only
one man at door dem walls all stone
but de roof him made ob thatch we
go wen you say capn
  tom studied the thick thatch of the
roof it was old and torn and in one
place he could sec the sky a star shone
square overhead to get out through
the roof would not be difficult he mo-
tioned to etion and took his stand un-
der the hole while etion agile as a
monkey swarmed up his shoulders and
reached with both hands at the roof
  that thatch came away at first in
handfuls of dirt and dust then in tufts
of dry grass and palm leaves finally
a two-foot hole yawned above them
outside the yelling and the raucous
laughter still kept up
  etion ran to the door and glanced
through a crack
  more men come he said  at
mean more rum capn wen they all
drunk we go wat about dis he
pointed at porton
  tom hesitated what about porton
etion chortled
  jorveaux saw him in pieces bimeby
that was true it was also true that
tom knew that he could not leave even
long-twelve porton to such a death he
had seen a part of the devilish tortures
inflicted by that blood-mad crew even
porton must be saved from that he
leaned over him and shook him into
consciousness porton sat up dazedly
  keep quiet if you love life said
tom fiercely he was doing a thing he
hated every instinct was to leave por-
ton-but he could not do that the
crowds drunk outside he said weve
dug a hole in the roof its our only
chance god help us if we fail now up
with you
  porton knew what failure meant for
him at least he rose twitched at his
belt and they joined etion
  etion first said tom hes lightest
you go after him when youre up low-
the scorpion

er your belt for me ill need a hand-
hold
  at a word etion scrambled to toms
shoulder leaped for the roof caught it
with both hands and disappeared in
the dusk he thrust his skinny arms
back and pulled porton scuffling to the
thatch then the belt was lowered to
tom a moment later the three men
lay low on the roof watching the drunk-
en negroes at the fires
  slide down on the dark side mut-
tered tom its only a few yards to
the jungles edge
  a quick slide a rustling fall and etion
was down tom went next and porton
fell on him like an avalanche keeping
to the low brush they slipped into a
narrow jungle path and stopped
  what now growled porton there
is no safety this side of the french
lines
 theres none there for me said
tom briefly
  thats my port said porton but
theyll shoot you when they know
youre a yankee you better hide till you
kin get away by sea you said youve
got a schooner off the coast can you
get to her
  i dont know ill have to said
tom grimly what a fool he was he
thought to let this damned pirate go
he might never have another chance to
square accounts and he already had
the chart to el cubil with porton
gone he could make his way to the
scorpion get to el cubil and loot the
place save his father damn porton
why could he not forget porton
etionll come with me he said
  all right said porton hi ope our
courses cross later hi owes you one fer
this whats your name mister what
did you say s the nyme o yer schoon-
er
  iris fore-top-sail schooner lied
tom glibly
 youre damned decent fer a yan-
kee muttered porton he passed into
the thick brush and spoke over his
shoulder the ony other yankee i
knowed was the skipper of that damned
bark catherine i took nyme o swayne
it was him i was holdin fer a ran-
som 
  was holding what terrible signifi-
cance lay behind that past tense it
struck tom like a blow he repeated
the words and did not know that he
had done so
  aye porton spoke carelessly i
landed em all three-the yankee skip-
per the lobster-back an is daughter
good-lookin piece she is too-a bit o
fire an flame if you ask me that skip-
per made a damned fool o hisself count
o seein me make a bit free with the
girl
  hes just a plain fool when i
take a woman shes mine that yan-
kee with his prayer-meetin notions
mixed in once too often hell not do it
again but damn it all lie was worth
a big fat ransom to me he got his
payment
  what toms mouth was harsh and
dry and little flashes of light seemed to
break inside his head
  a half ounce o lead where it done
him most good said porton
  the brush crackled the bamboos
rustled like iron rods as they clicked
into place behind him the next mo-
ment he was gone and the blackness of
the jungle swallowed him
chapter ix
letters of marque
they headed into the very
heart of the jungle and worked
their way along narrow paths
great trees heavy with wide-
mouthed orchids overhung them
thorny vines snatched at them they
were half naked when they debouched
upon a coral beach on which a ripple
of low surf broke the starlight dim

adventure
enough in the jungle seemed like dawn
to them and the sea-rim stood out
against the sky as though drawn in in-
dia ink tom threw himself face down
on the beach and stared off into the
night if the schooner was in the offing
his eyes would pick her up against the
horizon there was nothing the ring
of the horizon was unbroken his heart
sank as he turned to etion
  well get back to those coco-palms
he said well need the nuts when the
sun rises we dare not come into the
open by daylight to look for food and
drink
 they went back for the clump of
palms returned back for the beach with
arms full
  keep to the loose dry sand tom
cautioned we must not leave foot-
prints we must hide till we find some
way to get away
  they found a hiding place among
some great rocks on a little point that
jutted out in a miniature cape and they
lay hidden there all day night brought
relief and they bathed several times in
the sea and ate the coconuts they had
brought
  the sun rose on an empty sea in a
blaze of white-hot mist that gave way
to a copper glare they baked under it
until a wind from the sea blew a ten-
minute rain squall they alternately
stewed and roasted till the sun dropped
behind the line of the jungle and they
waked to life once more
  wed better get as far from here as
we can said tom he had been pon-
dering all day long what had happened
and considering their best plan of es-
cape by himself etion would have
had no trouble but he refused to leave
tom tom turned to him
  look here etion he said what
did you do with that canvas wallet
  put ovunga in him said etion i
put de ouanga in de wallet an put de
wallet back in portons shirt if e
french ever see at dey know porton
been in touch wid enemies ob france
  dodging in and out of the brush-for
they dared not travel continuously on
the open beach-they covered several
miles but it was not until late after-
noon that etion as they rounded a
rocky point gave a low whoop of de-
light
  deres a piroque capn he said
  it was not much but the sight of
that piroque filled toms heart with joy
the sea was in his very marrow and the
thought that he could seek safety on
blue water was a delight to him it
was an ordinary fishermans canoe
some eighteen feet long it had been
hollowed by fire and adze from a single
cottonwood log but it was seaworthy
and it held a net and a pair of paddles
tom leaped for it thrust it into deep
water put his load of coconuts in the
stern-sheets and almost threw etion in-
to it then he waded knee-deep in the
warm water stepped over the low gun-
wale and picked up a paddle while
etion took the other and settled him-
self cross-legged in the bow
  ifn em men o jorveauxs is in de
bresh dey may see us he said warn-
ingly
  no matter now they cant walk on
the water toms voice rose on a jubi-
lant note they may find another
canoe but weve got to risk that
  they made a good offing to help
matters out for food and to deceive any
one who might see them tom lay down
etion laid the net and took a paddle
and sat hunched up in the boat as any
fisherman would have sat watching his
nets
  the day seemed a million years long
both men grunted with relief as the
sun began to drop behind the distant
tree-line
 well etion- tom rose and
stretched to his full height -i reckon
weve got to risk another night ashore
well need fire to cook these fish and
weve got to have some more coconuts
the scorpion

-good god he said sharply whats
that
  etions incurious gaze followed toms
finger that pointed seaward then he
gave a little cry and sprang to his feet
staring at a silver point against the east-
ern skyline
  thats a sail etion tom almost
upset the crazy piroque as he drove his
paddle deep theres only one thing
that catches sunlight like that-new can-
vas thats the head of a fore-and-aft
sail catchin the settin sun
they paddled hard for an
hour inch by inch the silver
point rose first it was one
point then two it meant
nothing much to etion but toms heart
swelled
  look he shouted jubilantly cant
you see boy thats the head of a
fore-and-aft foresail we only saw one
spot o light at first because she was
headin right for us then she bore off
a bit and we opened her mainsail thats
a fore-and-aft schooner-and an amer-
ican
  etion shook his head most likely
french capn he said hard to see
so far away
  not a bit of it only americans use
cotton canvas for sails that canvas
is as white as snow english canvas
or french or spanish would be more
brown than white wait a bit shes
headin right for us but shes not sight-
ed us yet there comes the terral he
said as the land-wind began to make
off the land thatll mean a shift of
helm for her he watched eagerly till
the schooner headed off a little and he
got a slant at her from a different angle
he took one long look from under his
hand then sat down and began to pad-
dle frantically
  thats my own schooner the scor-
pion he said breathlessly look at
that patch in the foot of the main top-
mast staysail
  etion grunted none the wiser while
tom went on
  see that patch o new canvas i
cursed flynn for that one day back
home he forgot to take the staysail off
her when we tacked the fore-gaff tore
hell out of it thats the scorpion
etion head up for her
  under the urge of toms tongue etion
worked like two men and the little pir-
oque danced like a chip in a spill-way
as the scorpion running free drove
down on her a sharp yell from the
schooners bows made jerry lynn on
the quarter-deck stop in his short
stride then he leaped forward a
little later the scorpion ran up well to
windward luffed and lay with her head
sails shaking the piroque dancing in the
broken water under her lee every man
of the schooners crew lined the rail and
a long yell went up when tom followed
by etion climbed aboard the next
moment lynn had tom by both hands
and ives came running from the bows
  lord sir but were glad to have you
back ives voice told more than his
mere words what happened sir
come down into the cabin said
tom ive got a lot to tell you first
of all wheres de berrien
  sulkin in the cuddy lynn grinned
hes sore as a blind bear at first he
made a lot o trouble but old ben here
cracked him over the bows with a caulk-
in mallet after that he saw the light
what did he have to say asked
tom
  id hate to repeat it to you
 lynn grinned in english it d
sound just too bad in french it sound-
ed like five cats fightin i gather that
bein a frog he cant understand what
right we had to take him prisoner it
would have been all right to ketch king
george or president adams but to ketch
him was the sin against the holy
ghost
  ill see him said tom you and
ives come with me

adventure
seated at the litle cabin
table alphonse de berrien
demi-brigadier of the french
armies military governor of
haiti glanced up as the three men en-
tered the cabin he was a portly man
used to good living and his resentment
at having been snatched away from it
was evident at sight of the three men
he burst into a torrent of invective tom
smiled at him and waited for the storm
to subside then
  do you speak english he asked
general de berrien nodded what
does this outrage mean msieur
outrage tom grinned faith sir
it means that an american privateer has
had the brazen effrontery to raid a
french port and to carry off its gover-
nor as a prisoner it may mean more
than that general de berrien war
exists between your country and mine
i am an american privateer i hold
letters of marque properly made out by
my government authorizing me to fol-
low out any emprise of war under
those letters i can take burn and de-
stroy all property of the enemy and
sequestrate any property found under
his flag i will show you my letters if
you doubt what i say
  general de berrien made a motion of
dissent tom went on
  i am doing to you exactly what you
yourself have authorized porton to do
to us long-twelve porton the most
notorious pirate the spanish main has
seen since the days of carew and frome
this man porton was with you three
nights ago he dined with you
  you are wrong sir general de
berrien almost spat in high disgust it
is true that he was brought to see me
at my office he came to me to deal
with me about certain ships that  
  aye ships of spain cargoes of
arms and powder that he took from
spain and was planning to sell to the
slaves in revolt in haiti i tell you
general the man took them from a
spanish ship he made war under
french colors on a friendly nation with
whom it will be suicidal for france to
have armed conflict he has planned to
sell those arms to the slaves
  general de berriens face turned a
deep mulberry color his lips set
  you seem to believe what you tell
me monsieur he said i ask where
you learned this or think you learned
it
  i will lay all my cards on the table
first please remember this i have no
reason to lie to you i went ashore at
jacmel three nights ago with the intent
of capturing you if possible i needed a
man of weight and influence and i select-
ed you
  as we were returning to my boat
you will remember we were attacked by
a raiding party of ex-slaves they too
had planned to capture you-and in-
cidentally to raid the french lines for
arms
  they missed you whom i had al-
ready taken prisoner but they did man-
age to capture the porton i can give
you the details of what happened be-
cause i was there and heard and saw
all that took place wait just a mo-
ment
at a signal toms steward
got out a bottle of white rum
and set it with glasses and
cool water on the table tom
spoke anew carefully avoiding any
reference to the taking of the french
merchantman he gave all the rest of
the details and painted a word picture
of his shore adventure that made gen-
eral de berrien sit up he told how jor-
veaux had made his deal with porton
for the arms on the belle of bristol
how porton had agreed to sacrifice his
entire crew to earn his own safety he
concluded with
  i think you know now monsieur
how and where these slaves get the arms
that make it possible for them to com-
mit crimes that offend the world they
the scorpion

get them from porton he sends his
partner batten to discover the sailing
dates of ships going under neutral flags
then with his own ship under french
colors he takes those ships he has
been robbing and killing citizens of
countries with whom france certainly
can not desire to go to war
  from all of which said de berrien
i gather that you sir have some per-
sonal grievance against this porton
i have sir he owes me a debt so
great that i can hope you will not be
present when it is paid a spasm twist-
ed toms face in the meantime mr
lynn he said with a return to his best
quarter-deck manner will you kindly
set all sail and give the steerman a
course that will bring us in to jacmel
we will run in under a flag of truce sir
what the devil    jerry lynn
stared at him as though he believed his
captain had lost his mind and ives sat
astounded but tom merely grinned
and nodded confirmation of his order
lynn went slowly on deck and ives and
de berrien sat eyeing tom in silence
they could not fathom what was to
come
  and now about my ransom sir said
the frenchman
  there is no question of ransom gen-
eral said tom i had certain plans
for which your presence was necessary
i tell you frankly sir that i intended
to exchange you for porton these plans
have now been changed and your pres-
ence is not necessary to me i shall
enter jacmel harbor under a flag of
truce and my boat will set you ashore
i can only say sir that i regret that
exigencies of war have made necessary
the hardships to which you have been
subjected
  the frenchman sat astounded for
a while words failed him then
  sir he began and again sir   
he could say no more tom waved a
hand and refilled both glasses i have
not told you all sir because my per-
sonal affairs would only embarrass you
my account lies with this man porton
all else fades into insignificance my
chief difficulty lies in the fact that i
can not meet porton on the high seas
he keeps under the protection of your
batteries
 not now monsieur general de
berrien uttered a sharp oath true
the man has carried on his operations
under letters of marque issued to him
under my own hand and seal but under
those letters he has made war on friend-
ly governments he has given or sold
arms to the foes of france he has
killed women and children can you
doubt monsieur what i will do the
moment i am free i will declare this
man porton to be the pirate that he has
proved himself
  steady sir tom smiled a little
you have but my unsupported word
will you hear what a free negro has to
say he may perhaps be known to you
his name is etion he knows much
that took place
  etion le grand he was the body
servant to monsieur le gai and was
sent to france on the brig le cref de
foret how is etion here
  he shall tell you himself general i
trust he will convince you that i have
not lied to you in any case i will land
you at jacmel
 tom summoned etion and left in
half an hour etion came out of the cabin
and was followed by de berrien tom
after a look at him motioned to lynn
  helm over he said and give her
all shell carry head for jacmel
they raised the red-and-white-and-
yellow houses just before dusk the two
big french frigates to port and star-
board of the big yellow corvette loomed
like ships of the line at sight of a
white flag fluttering on the scorpion a
boat shot from the quai des marines
and after a moment of tangled speech
hooked on to the scorpions rail then
general de berrien rushed on deck and

adventure
flung his arms about tom who stood by
the weather rail the little frenchman
dropped all english as he almost em-
braced his captor
  adieu mon brave he said then
with a quick rush of words this man
porton shall never find refuge under
french colors
  the boat dropped away from the rail
and lynn turned to tom who was
studying the corvette through half-
closed eyes
well said jerry i sup-
pose this all means somethin
-but not to me
  porton will never again be
given asylum in a french port said
tom i landed de berrien to assure
myself of that i didnt need him
jerry make sail if you please
  lynn turned away and motioned to a
man to douse the white flag the sails
filled and before either of the french
frigates realized that an american pri-
vateer had been under their very guns
the scorpion on a taut bowline was
heading out of the bay her rail lined
with grinning faces tom headed again
for the cuddy and stopped the steward
who was removing the glasses
  well want another caulker of ruin
to be
  he said now jerry ill explain
  youd better said jerry glumly
  when you let that frog go you threw
  away two thousand dollars
    tom laughed and flung on the table
  the chart taken from porton
    theres the chart of the only an-
  chorage at el cubil he said well
  beat porton to his liidin place well
  loot it and pick up porton at sea the
  frenchman will chase him out of the
  port i doubt if porton himself will es-
  cape from those negroes in any case
  we will release his prisoners-if he hasnt
  killed them and he told lynn of por-
  tons last words
    if he does escape hell head at once
  for this el cubil said jerry thats
  sure what now
    run up the coast water the ship
  and get wood for the galley said tom
  theyll not follow us now then well
  shape a course for el cubil well strip
  the place as empty as a rat-ridden hold
  well take his loot and free his prison-
  ers and if we have any luck well
  meet long-twelve porton at sea at
  sea jerry with the scorpion well to
  windward and ben ives with his long
  twenty-four against that mouthful of
  brass teeth t saw grinning at us from the
  bristol slut

report-to colonel t everett
aplin d s o commanding
officer kings royal rifles b e
f august th 
  between one and two oclock on the
morning of august th lieutenant
h c darrington m c accompanied
by sergeant james hanley and twelve
men of the regimental scout platoon left
our lines for the purpose of entering and
bombing the enemy works known as the
essen redoubt there was no other ac-
tivity on this sector of the front on the
night in question troops holding the
front lines although aware of the intend-
ed raid heard no firing or bombing in
the vicinity of the enemy trenches until
 am when the barrage which pre-
ceded our scheduled attack opened
  captain henry m johnson command-
ing elements of the kings royal rifles
in the subsequent assault reports that
while advancing through the enemy posi-
tions he came upon the bodies of lieu-

tenant darrington sergeant hanley and
eleven men in a firing bay of the enemys
second line sgt hanley and the eleven
men had been stripped of puttees and
equipment and shot through the head
the body of lieutenant darrington was
found with an empty automatic pistol
by its side
  a hurried inspection made at the time
by capt johnson and later verified by
the burying detail disclosed no evidence
of any wounds upon the body of the
officer from the condition of the wounds
of the sergeant and the other men it was
evident that they had been recently shot
to death at close quarters lieutenant
darrington though apparently un-
wounded appears to have met his death
before the others as in his case alone
rigor mortis had already set in
  the thirteenth man who is known to
have accompanied lt darrington that
morning is missing and unaccounted for
from the scout platoon records and from

adventure
the report of the burying detachment
that interred the bodies the missing man
is apparently one private harry martin
nd company attached to the scout
platoon
  as ail the members of this scout pla-
toon-with the possible exception of pri-
vate martin-perished that morning or
had been killed or evacuated previously

c o intelligence section
private harry martins story
as given to colonel t everett apkn
d s o six months later
its all a bit foggy now sir but i think
i can give you the main facts it
hardly seems possible that all those fine
chaps could have been done-in the way
you say and poor mr darrington such
a splendid gentleman really i never
thought jerry would ever put his star up
he seemed to have a charmed life youll
pardon me sir but the whole thing has
come as a bit of a shock i never dreamed
that such a thing could happen although
conditions were a bit out of the ordinary
that night you see sir the lieutenant
wasnt in the habit of taking more than
one or two men out with him-five at the
most-and we used to take turns id
been out with him any number of times
our methods were always about the same
and we all knew his ways and thought
the world and all of him
  whenever he had decided to go out on
a job those of us whose turn it was to
accompany him would line up behind
him and crawl on hands and knees into
no mans land as far as we could go
then wed wiggle forward on our bellies
-one behind the other-each with his
left hand on the foot of the bloke ahead
our pistols ready and a bag of grenades
slung in back mr darrington used to
signal to us by clicking the finger nails
of his thumb and third finger like this
when we got near jerrys lines he used
to stop now and then
  he was most cautious and though
he had no fear whatever sir he never
took unnecessary chances hed click
once if he wanted us to come up in line
on the left and twice to come up on the
right and so on-whatever signals hed
arranged beforehand when he had us
in position all headed toward the spot
we were to bomb hed scrape his finger-
nail across his helmet-slow like that
was the signal for each man to get his
grenades ready take a bomb pull the
pin and stand ready to let fly then
wed wait until he yelled throw
fire or some such command and wed
raise up and let them have it
  the first couple of flashes usually gave
us our target and wed peg till our bombs
were gone and then scatter and sneak
back as best we could it wasnt difficult
sir for we always surprised them and
they rarely had an opportunity to defend
themselves but oftentimes wed have
to lay low outside the wire for some
hours before the machine-guns stopped
traversing and the shell-fire died down
that was the main danger
  then wed sneak back and mr dar-
rington always tried to get back into our
own lines without being challenged in
fact after wed left the fixed trench lines
and were working in the open he con-
sidered it downright disgraceful for us
to be seen or heard even by our own out-
posts and we all got to be right smart
at our jobs jerry didnt get on to us
often
  fact is we lost very few men while
patrolling or raiding mr darrington had
a keen nose for defiladed ground even
at night and he moved about like a
ghost the men got to know him as the
kitten which while not very respectful-
like certainly fit him to a tee he was a
mighty slick article sir pon my word
you could hear the others now and
the kitten

again but you could never hear him
  but you want to hear about what
happened that last night youll have
to pardon me sir if i ramble a bit but
now that im on it it all comes back
very clear
  well sir you see we had been out
every night for weeks and wed lost a lot
of men-mostly from shell fire we lost
far more that way than when out with
mr darrington as a matter of fact by
that time there were only thirteen of us
left including sgt hanley well sir
late that afternoon mr darrington came
back and told us he was going to take
the whole lot of us out that night he
didnt seem to be quite himself as he was
describing the job to us we had never
attempted anything just like it before
and we didnt care for it even a little bit
i dont think that he did either but he
was determined to go through with it and
went to no end of trouble to explain and
describe everything
  after dark he went up to the line
again with sgt hanley to explore a gap
he had found under the german wire
the gap had been caused by water run-
ning out of a drain in the low part of the
enemy trench the drain a narrow sort
of gully-like started from under the
wire where it had washed away the dirt
and ran back to the front edge of the
parapet it was about five feet deep at
that point i should judge then it went
into a tunnel-some ten feet long-that
connected with the floor of the trench
and just large enough for a man to crawl
through
  the plan was for us to slip under
the wire and wait in the gully while
the kit-beg pardon sir-while the
lieutenant went ahead and had a look
about if the trench was unoccupied he
was to crawl in and make sure that the
coast was clear then he was to click
twice as a signal for us to follow him
through the drain and into the trench
  that is-all except me i was to stay
behind just inside the wire as a lookout
he gave the men strict orders to have
their pistols ready at all times and for
each man to pull the pin of a bomb and
stand ready the instant he had cleared
the drain when they were all in they
were to follow mr darrington down the
trench until they located jerry every
hundred paces or so the last man was to
drop off and remain behind to act as a
guard so the main party couldnt be
taken by surprise from the rear
  if the trench was occupied and he
couldnt get in through the drain he was
to scrape his helmet as a signal for us to
spread out along the parapet and give it
to them over the top well sir he had us
go over it a dozen times until each one
of us knew precisely what was expected
of him
  at about  we started out it was
quiet as death that night and mr dar-
rington was quite up the pole about it
you see sir a bit of noise along the front
was an excellent thing for our little busi-
ness but as luck would have it there
wasnt a sound i was the last man in
the line and it seemed to me that the
chaps up ahead were clumping along like
draught horses and after wed gotten
pretty close to jerrys wire and started
crawling the noise was downright hide-
ous
  perhaps it was just a case of nerves
sir for i dont mind admitting now that
i had more than a bit of wind up you
see the stillness was something new to us
and i had a feeling in my bones that we
were headed for trouble
but things went along all
right and after a time we got
to the gap and through the
wire mr darrington clicked
for us to stop and pon my word sir
that click sounded like a rifle shot we
crouched in the gully and waited while
he went ahead we could tell when he
entered the drain for his body blocked
out the faint circle of light that showed
through the further end

adventure
  he lay listening in the drain for quite
a time then the light showed again and
we knew he had gotten in all right he
took plenty of time looking around and it
was several minutes before he appeared
at the opening again and clicked twice
that was the signal for the rest of the
men to follow him and one by one they
crawled in and disappeared
 when the last man had gotten
through i sat and waited at first all
was still but after a time i heard some
whispering and mumbling and moving
about inside the trench i knew from
that that the germans couldnt be any-
where about and i dont mind saying
sir that i breathed a lot easier then it
was quiet again for a while and i thought
that they had gone on down the trench
but presently i heard two clicks and saw
mr darrington at the further end of the
drain i figured that he wanted me to
come closer so i crawled up the gully
  presently he clicked again so i
stopped and he went away shortly af-
ter that i could hear them moving on
down the trench toward the second line
i didnt mind waiting for the worst part
of it seemed to be over and  had already
concluded that the germans who had
been on the run for several days had
pulled a sneak-out on us this if i may
say so sir was quite satisfactory to me
  but when the hours passed and it
started to get light i begau to have mis-
givings i knew that nothing serious
could have happened to them for there
hadnt been so much as a sound but i
figured that they ought to have been
back by now i had just begun to get
nervous when all at once our guns
opened and dropped a barrage right on
me i tried to crawl up into the drain
but i dont know whether i ever got
there or not for the next thing  knew
i was in a hospital in blighty and four
weeks had been torn from the calendar
i was pretty badly shot up sir and it
wasnt till well after the armistice that
i could really get around again
  you see sir we always removed all
signs of identification except our number
tags when we patrolled and as mine
was shot away when i was wounded no-
body knew who i was until i had re-
gained consciousness i expect thats
why you had so much trouble in trac-
ing me
  but here i am and those are the
facts just as ive given them to you i
dont blame you for being puzzled sir
the whole thing seems downright incred-
ible i know that nothing could have
happened to them in the front line and
certainly id have heard the fuss even
had they been attacked in the second
line im sure sir that no matter how
they were caught they must have been
shot after our barrage started other-
wise id have heard it but how could
jerry have captured all thirteen of them
without starting a fearful rumpus and
mr darrington with no wounds on him
and his own pistol by his side-and that
empty
  as i say sir it dont seem possible
it all looks mighty queer i know that
every man-jack of them had his pistol
cocked when he entered the drain and
i know that every man had a fused
grenade in his right hand a second after
hed entered the trench how jerry
could have jumped them is more than i
can see certainly it seems as though
there would have been hell to pay for at
least a few minutes and all shot in the
head
  mr darrington would never have
done that sir and even had they found
themselves hopelessly surrounded they
wouldnt have done away with them-
selves they were fighters those men
every damned one of them and were
quite accustomed to having the odds
against them and you say their puttees
had been removed what do you make
of that sir
  well i give it up and im sorry i
ever came to hear of it its set me back
no end i assure you poor mr darring-
the kitten

ton such a splendid man i wonder
what it was that overtook him and the
others i hope sir if you ever do solve
it youll be kind enough to let me know
for the question will plague me to my
dying day
  all shot through the head my oh
my and the kit-er mr darring-
ton-dead with no wounds and his
empty gun beside him
  my god sir its enough to drive a
man mad
the story of colonel t everett aplin
d s o
i suppose i should have dismissed
the whole thing as just one more grue-
some tragedy of the war had it not been
for the fact that i had known darry
since a child i went through school
with his father and knew his mother
when we were both in our teens
  as a boy darry wasnt like his two
older brothers-who were always up to
some sort of deviltry-but quiet and re-
served and just a bit shy he wasnt
given to athletics though he could sit a
horse well enough and i never dreamed
of his becoming a soldier he just didnt
seem cut out for it perhaps it was pre-
cisely this fact that drew me to him
soldiering is a good enough game for cer-
tain types but darry-well darry
seemed destined for something better
  but the war sucked in all kinds alike
and when he came out in  and was
assigned to my regiment i wasnt a bit
pleased you see his being there brought
to me a responsibility that wasnt quite
in my line i knew his folks expected me
to keep an eye out for him and i also
knew that a second lieutenants chances
on the somme were rather less than slim
but i couldnt show any favoritism and
my only hope was that hed soon receive
some sort of cushy wound that would
keep him out of it until the war was over
and still not handicap his future
  we were in a comparatively quiet sec-
tor when he joined us and i assigned him
to a company to sort of feel him out
he didnt mix very well at first and al-
though he made no enemies neither did
he make any friends from what i could
gather he preferred to be alone though
he attended to his duties well enough he
spent most of his spare time on his own
  then his outfit took over the front
line and i heard that he had taken to
patrolling how it started i dont know
but he rapidly developed a morbid liking
for prowling around no mans land
one or two men from his platoon were
drawn to him by some kindred spirit and
it wasnt long before he was bringing in
bits of very valuable information
  it was a job that the others were only
too willing to turn over to him for ive
found that even the bravest men in an
attack dont particularly relish crawling
around between the lines in the dead of
night his quiet nocturnal activities
rather set him apart from the rest and
although the other young officers found
it impossible to warm up to him he was
soon held in no small respect by every
member of the regiment during the day
he was utterly unimpressive but at night
he took over the whole show
  i knew that just before he came out
his first love affair had ended rather sud-
denly and to him disastrously and i
was afraid he was trying to end matters
as quickly and quietly as possible some
chaps did that you know so i called
him to me one day and had a talk with
him he assured me that my fears were
groundless he explained that he real-
ized only too well that he had never been
cut out for a company officer he was
not a leader standing before his platoon
he felt embarrassed and out of place
but at night alone there were things he
could do he explained that he was
simply trying to make up in one direc-
tion for what he lacked in the others
  from then on whenever we took over
a new sector he went quietly to work
in no time he knew every inch of the

adventure
german wire the location of their listen-
ing posts and strong points and the
weak spots in their defenses a little
group soon grew up around him and
before long any patrolling required on
our front was turned over to him
  in time he came to be rather famous
and due to the uncanny quietness with
which he left and re-entered our lines he
became known throughout the regiment
as the kitten at night the men in
the front line kept one eye cocked on
the sky and when conditions were fa-
vorable they knew very well that some
time before dawn the kitten was sure
to strike at some point or another
  then before the big push in  orders
came to bring in prisoners along the en-
tire front for the purpose of ascertaining
the morale condition and general timbre
of the troops opposite darry knew that
i was planning an extensive raid and set
about getting the information i needed
in order to carry the thing through suc-
cessfully then two days before the raid
was to be sprung he came to me with
the request that he and a few of his fel-
low ghouls be entrusted with the job
  the enemy lines opposite were the
strongest and most difficult to approach
that we had ever faced he pointed out
that an extensive raid would disclose the
coming attack result in serious loss of
life to the raiding party and in all prob-
ability fail to accomplish it purpose
my plans were so complete and extensive
that i did not doubt as to the raids suc-
cess but i had to admit that he was
right on the first two counts i felt sure
that he would fail for bombing an iso-
la ied post and bringing back prisoners
are two very different things
  but he seemed so set upon it and
pleaded so earnestly that i finally gave
in unknown to him however i went
ahead with my plans just to be ready in
the event that his attempt proved futile
  well gentlemen it seems that his pa-
trolling activities of the past week had
put jerry wise at any rate they kneav
something was up and were on the look-
out they must have received word of
our plans and were expecting a much
larger raid how he got into their
trenches i dont know but seeing only
four men they let him come they
seemed to have known that the real raid
was scheduled for the next night and
figuring that this was just another prow-
ling party they were reluctant to waste
on three or four men the splendid am-
bush they had planned it was precise-
ly this that saved him
  but they underestimated the kit-
ten and when they did decide to quietly
gather him in they found they had
struck a tartar when they jumped him
i was up forward listening and roundly
cursing myself for having allowed him to
go it was all over in a second a dozen
grenades or so a few pistol shots one or
two yells and then-silence no rockets
went up no barrage came over whatever
had happened had happened quickly
  i waited around for half an hour and
then went back to my p c i had never
felt quite so low and the look in the
eyes of the men that i passed as i made
my way down the trench seemed to con-
demn me it was the first time that i
realized what a place darry held in their
hearts i entered the p c sick all over
and just on the verge of a blue funk
but i hadnt had time to toss aside my
helmet when there was a commotion
outside i rushed out
  down the trench with two of his men
came the kitten and behind them
an excited whispering mob that seemed
to include the entire regiment darry
and one of his men had been wounded
but the unwouuded one was carrying a
fourth man and in the center of the
group was a german sergeant
  the fourth man was found to be dead
but the germans never had the pleasure
of burying him darry and the two
others had seen to that they had fought
the kitten

their attackers off broken contact and
sneaked back to our lines with a pris-
oner and their dead companion
  a few minutes later darry went back
to the hospital knowing full well that id
soon have an m c coming down to him
the german sergeant was
soon induced to talk you may
be sure that i listened to his
story with profound interest
it seems that they were fully aware of
our plans for the next night and well
prepared to meet them if what he told
me was the truth we wouldnt have stood
a ghost of a chance the raiding party
would have been annihilated
  darrys wound healed quickly he
was back in ten days and going right at
it again he was more than a hero now
he was a legend every man along that
entire section of the front knew about
the kitten of the kings royal rifles
  after the disasters of the spring of 
we took hold again and fought our way
back to our old positions jerry was
feeling the strain and by summer we
had broken through his lines and the
trench warfare had given way to one of
movement this suited darry perfectly
so i got him a pip and put him in charge
of the regimental scout platoon with or-
ders to do as he saw fit
  well gentlemen the job had been
made for him and he found himself right
in his element in no time he had mold-
ed his little force into the deadliest night
fighting-machine on the western front
he and his handful of men ranged up
and down the enemy lines dealing death
and destruction nearly every night calls
for his services came from every com-
pany in the regiment  take my oath
that it seemed to me that he was beating
the german army single-handed
  due to his activities our line was al-
ways out ahead our attacks went fur-
ther and our losses were fewer i dont
know how many machine-guns he put
out of action the night before our at-
tacks but i do know that time and time
again when the kings royals went for-
ward next morning they found the guns
that had been holding them up were
manned only by the dead
  we pushed ahead until august when
we ran up against a nasty little system
of trenches that succeeded in stopping
our advance the lines on our right and
left were still going forward and i knew
that the trench position couldnt hold
out long without taking the risk of being
surrounded but we were a proud and
cocky outfit and not accustomed to lag-
ging behind the rest of the line so i de-
cided not to wait and ordered a stiff
barrage and concentrated attack for the
morning of august th
  i knew nothing of darrys plan if i
had i certainly would have stopped it
it was gallant and courageous but fool-
hardy and unnecessary nevertheless
normally i would have been advised of
it but we were going hammer and tongs
at the time and i frankly admit that t
didnt always know just what darry was
doing
  but ill never forget that night mail
came up just before we went over and f
took a moment off to rest my nerves and
read a note from darrys father he
hadnt heard from darry for some weeks
and was worried he hoped id be able
to get word to his son that the girl back
home had changed her mind and was
ready whenever darry was to announce
their engagement perhaps the m c
had something to do with that but
there was a far more important engage-
ment for me to think about just then
and for a moment i forgot it
  it wasnt until the next evening that
word came to me of darrys death 
had long since learned to take the news
of the death of a lifelong friend as a
matter to be regretted but expected but
this was different darry-the kitten-
wasnt just a man wasnt just a friend
he was the regiment
  it was an unspeakable disaster of

adventure
course we went right on but it wasnt
the same the dash and spirit of the
men were gone they did their hideous
work doggedly and well but without the
old-time zest and pride the focal point
the nucleus of the regiments interest-
from myself to the newest recruit-had
suddenly ceased to exist
  the kitten and his quiet midnight
murderers were no longer with us
stripped of their equipment and shot in
the face and what of darry with
his empty pistol in his hand and no
mark on his boyish body
  but as the days went by and the mys-
tery of his death remained unsolved the
sadness of the mens loss changed into a
maniacal resentment the regiment rose
with an overwhelming lust for revenge
and i feel sure that in the days and
nights that followed many a weary
panic-stricken german met his death on
the point of a bayonet instead of loafing
in a prison pen as he might have done
had darrv lived
  when things quieted down a bit i did
what i could to ascertain the facts you
have read the report that my inquiries
brought forth time added nothing to it
it only confirmed the tales of the men
and added to the mystery
  but the question never quite left my
mind and later-much later-when the
war was over and i was back in mufti
again i sought to find out what had
become of the missing thirteenth man
well i found him and you have heard
his story make what you will of it
it helped me not at all
  and now there seems to be no other
trail to follow i have listened to many
explanations but knowing darry and
his men as i did none of them seems
quite plausible so i suppose well have
to let it rest as just one of the many un-
solved mysteries of the war but i
would certainly like to know just what
did happen twelve men shot in the
head and darry dead with no wound
upon him and his empty pistol by his
side god almighty
the story of august schmitt
formerly corporal in the prussian
guards the kaisers own
tt was in july that the luck started to
  turn against us by august the whole
picture had changed we were up against
the english and a crack regiment at that
this outfit had developed a method of
night raiding that had been playing the
devil with our morale they struck like
lightning and gave us no peace some
of our younger troops had gone yellow
even the old-timers were jumpy when
opposite them
  we were in trenches on a hill good
trenches and good wire i was on watch
in the front line it was dark and i
couldnt see so well because the ground
sloped down from our trench so i slid
out over the top and lay in the grass
a drain went out under our parapet and
into a gully that ran down to our wire
about nine oclock i heard a faint click
out in front
  what was it i wondered maybe a
strand of wire slipped maybe some poor
wounded fellow is trying to get back to
our lines but i watch to make sure
there was no moon but the stars were
out then i see a shadow it is in the
gully just inside the wire
  i watch after some time the shadow
moves it moves closer to me up the
gully i put my sights upon it no use
taking any chances it keeps coming
soon i can make it out it is a man
he is below me now where the gully is
deep this is no wounded comrade this
is an englishman and very likely one of
the accursed night murderers we have
been trying to bag for so long i press
my trigger slowly his time has come
  but i hear two more clicks further
away it is a signal i must be very
wary perhaps there are others i am
the kitten

in an exposed position and one grenade
would finish me i release the pressure
on the trigger and wait another shadow
comes forward it joins the first they
lay peering at the drain that runs into
our trench another click they start
to slide back i press the trigger again
but something tells me no
  a better plan forms in my head here
i say to myself is where i get a sergeants
job to kill one of these raiders would
certainly be something but to catch
them alive would be more so i lay low
they slide away noiselessly good thing
i came out here from the fire step i
would have seen nothing they would
have returned later on and snuffed us
out in precisely the same way they have
done so many times before i give them
plenty of time to get away then i slip
back into the trench and spread the
news
  these fellows i tell my comrades were
just looking the ground over and they
were clever-believe me-as quiet as
cats they will come again probably
four or five of them i know their sig-
nals two clicks-advance one click
-retreat our sergeant is excited and
is all for lining up out in the grass and
shooting them when they come into the
gully bah this would be foolish
shoot at them and get killed by the an-
swering shower of grenades in the end
he listens to reason
  there are fourteen of us quickly i
tell them my scheme i will wait outside
the parapet until they return then i
will slide back and give the warning
beyond doubt they will try to enter
through the drain if they think that the
trench is unoccupied to do this they
will have to enter one by one we will
line up on each side of the entrance and
as they come in we will clip them in
back of the head with a-well it must
not make a noise
  my brain is working fast i have an
idea i wrap my heavy trench knife
with my first aid bandage that will do
the trick a sharp blow hardly makes a
sound after we clip the first one we
will take him by the arms and pull him
in to one side and pass him along he
will have no equipment other than his
pistol and grenades for otherwise he
could not get through the drain
  the pistol is the thing to look out for
it must be grabbed at the very instant
that the blow is delivered if the blow
is a good one the pistol will not fire re-
flexes do not contract-they relax-from
a blow at the base of the brain
  at each end of the bay we will post a
man with many grenades if anything
goes wrong these men will throw rapidly
into the gully we should bag the first
man at any rate and then if necessary
we can meet the others with their own
weapons perhaps we can bag more
  they agree to my plan we take po-
sitions and rehearse we will not need
any help we will tell no one they
might get jumpy and give away the
show this is our own little party
  soon we are ready and i climb out to
my post but not quite so far as before
just far enough so i can see the gully
where it is shallow by the wire it is
damp and cold and i have to fight to
keep awake i wait for hours
  it is absolutely quiet i have not seen
it this way since  i close my eyes
to rest them one cannot stare forever
without going blind i open them again
at last my blood boils and i stiffen
a shadow is in the gully just inside the
wire the shadow moves that is enough
for me i slide back and give the alarm
instantly every man becomes tense it
is quiet as death we wait nervously
perhaps they have heard me enter the
trench and have been scared away
  but no there is a click faint but
unmistakable the stop signal we wait
again how long god knows each
second is an hour then faint scrapings
come from the drain there is a man
in it he is coming nearer more scrap-
ing-very faint very cautious now his

adventure
head cannot be more than a foot inside
the drain he waits we wait then a
scrape and all at once his head and shoul-
ders appear four hands move swiftly
and there is a dull thud not loud but
-well drop an orange on the floor
  he slumps his helmet is in pauls
right hand and both wrists are caught
in a vise on the other side strumpf
has the fellows revolver and is quietly
putting down his muffled trench knife
then a heave slowly deliberately we
pull him in and deposit him in the cor-
ner the last man on the line gags him
and stands by ready to deliver another
blow if necessary the next two men
step up to the drain we wait and wait
but no more follow
  himmell i am a fool of course the
others are waiting to find out if all is
well i exchange the englishmans hel-
met for my own and show myself at the
end of the drain then i click twice-
with my finger nails and step back that
fetches them they come louder this
time they think the trench is empty
and that there is nothing to fear i am
so happy i could shout no matter
what happens now i shall get my pro-
motion
  well to make a long story short there
were thirteen of them all told we
thought they would never stop coming
but everything went like clockwork al-
though we never expected so many the
place was crowded let me tell you when
we were sure they were all in we didnt
know what to do with them some of
them were coming to life so we bound
and gagged each one it was a good
thing that they wore those long wrapped
puttees or we would have run out of
tying material
  then a thought struck me what if
they have left a lookout outside might
as well try for him too i still have on
the english helmet so i go to the drain
and click twice i wait but no one
comes i click again but nothing hap-
pens they have not left a lookout
good and now we must not delay
some of the men are so bitter that they
want to kill them on the spot i hush
them abruptly we must carry them
back to the commanders dugout
  they agree each man shoulders a
prisoner and we stagger to the rear
but our luck has been too
good it can not last now
it deserts us entirely as we
reach the support line a lieu-
tenant with many troops comes rushing
up there is an enemy attack coming
every man to his post there is not a
minute to lose this is no time for pris-
oners the lieutenant orders us to drop
them in the second line bay and post a
guard it is an outrage i protest
  shut up he yells at me obey or-
ders every man to his post
  but how will we get them back i
demand
  what do you care kill the dogs if
necessary god knows they have killed
enough of us we may all be prisoners
ourselves if we dont step lively
  my heart sinks the guts seem to
drain out of me am i to be cheated out
of my glory scattered shelling begins
lights go up my comrades drop the
prisoners and rush back to the front line
i stay where i am it is a sinful shame
that all this nights work should be
wasted i could cry with rage and dis-
appointment but it is getting light i
see one of my prisoners is an officer i
crouch beside him he is dead the
first blow was harder than necessary i
curse death is far too good for him
  i rip off his bonds and search him he
is not a bad looking fellow but not of
the soldier type certainly not the kind
you would expect to find on a job like
this i quickly inspect the others sev-
eral seem to be dead also perhaps only
unconscious some are awake and glar-
ing at me with hateful eyes my brain
reels i know how they feel i am
filled with hatred and loathing for them
tiie kitten

many of my comrades have been killed
by these men-struck down in the night
with no chance to defend themselves
  the shelling is getting worse i am
nervous and unstrung the world is a
bedlam around me i work feverishly
one of them is a sergeant what a haul
one officer one sergeant and eleven men
and all for nothing ach gotti
  but the strain is getting the best of
me the shells are coming closer i am
trembling with fear and excitement
  then the world splits open and the
english barrage is upon me not exactly
on me but on the front line it is a bad
barrage terrible in a few moments 
will be blown to pieces what can t do
 must leave them or be killed t have
no longer strength enough to carry one
of them but if one of them could walk
ah then i could take him back with
me i untie them with trembling lingers
and try to pull them to their feet tt is
useless some of their eyes are alive but
their bodies are dead paralyzed i am
sobbing hysterically my head is ready
to burst but it is no use their legs
will not support them
  i can wait no longer under this bar-
rage those who arc not killed will have
to retreat some of these prisoners may
be rescued alive it must not be they
must not live to kill again the lieuten-
ant has said to shoot them if necessary
now there is no other way for it tt is
up to me but this is not me this man
is crazy my muscles act as if guided
by some outside force
  i take out my pistol it shakes in my
hand a shell lands close dirt rains
down upon me i am laughing and cry-
ing in turn as though in a dream i
stagger about and shoot them one by
one soon my magazine is empty in
my pocket is one of their pistols i take
it out there is no time to pick the living
from the dead i finish my job
  i come to the young officer last the
other pistol is empty now but he i
know has been dead from the first what
a prize he would have been ach gott
that things should end this way but i
must go i drop the pistol and sway
drunkenly i am weak and wet with
sweat my knees are knocking together
  then all hell breaks loose the bar-
rage has lengthened and is upon me
screaming men arc running wildly up
and down the trench for an instant i
lean against the wall and vomit
  then i dash away there is a fearful
shriek and a splitting blinding light
  well that is the end of the story it
all seems like a nightmare to me now
but some merciful fellows stopped long
enough to carry me back i woke up in
the hospital you can sec for yourself
what they did to me

bowie and his
big knife
a fact story by meigs o frost
jim bowie saw big money ahead
for the first time in his life it
made him eloquent facing his
brothers rezin p bowie and john j
bowie all three had carved their lit-
tle plantation out of virgin forest there
by bayou boeuf in rapides parish
louisiana they had made some money
out of their cotton crops jim had been
away on a business trip down-river to
new orleans now he was revealing to
rezin and john that he had been to see
jean lafitte at galveston island he
was arguing that they pool the money
they had made on white cotton and
plunge on black ivory-illegal negro
slaves out of africa
 the three brothers had come up in
the hard school of the frontier since
their father rezin bowie married their
mother elvira jones bowie in burke
county georgia the family had moved
every time a neighbors cabin got near
enough so they could see his chimney-
smoke old rezin bowie didnt like to
feel crowded
  first to tennessee then to ken-
tucky where in logan county jim
bowie was born in g then to mis-
souri then down to catahoula parish
louisiana seeking fortune in that valley
empire president thomas jefferson had
bought in the louisiana purchase of
 there just past his eighteenth
birthday in  jim bowie had struck
out for himself staked a homestead by
bayou boeuf near by on the red river
was alexandria the parish seat
  now it was  jim bowie at twen-
ty-two loomed head and shoulders above
his brothers and they were no weak-
lings but he stood six-feet-three he
weighed one hundred eighty-five pounds
of bone rawhide and steel wire a
thick unruly shock of sandy hair topped
his tall figure his eyes were deep-set
gray arresting his hands were huge
and hard with fingers like steel hooks
whipsawing boards does that to you-
or kills you
  rapides respected the youngster who
at eighteen had cleared his own land

bowie and his big knife

with an axe and with one helper had
whipsawed boards of the felled timber
to get needed cash they knew what
i hat meant you dug a sawpit built a
platform beside it you hauled the
heavy trunks and heaved them butt-
down into the pit leaning against the
platform then one man on the plat-
form one below you hauled that heavy
whipsaw back and forth endlessly until
the logs were sawn boards then you
lashed the boards into a raft you
rafted them on bayou boeuf the red
river the mississippi river to alex-
andria or new orleans depending on
the market sold them and started back
on foot eyes alert and weapons ready
for highwaymen then you went to
work sweating out a cotton crop it
was money earned that way that jim
bowie wanted his brothers to plunge
with him  jean lafittes black ivory
  jean lafitte was a name to thrill
louisiana youth then he was robin
hood reborn letters of marque from
the young republic of cartagena in
south america legalized his raids on
spanish maritime commerce but every-
body knew he never worried about flags
this buccaneer of barataria this plain
pirate of the gulf of mexico and the
caribbean he commanded a fast lit-
tle fleet heavily armed and manned
his first palisaded fort warehouse
slave barracoons rose on grande terre
a sandy sea island below barataria
about one hundred miles southwest of
new orleans he reached the city by
his secret winding bayou channels mer-
chants and planters eagerly bought his
goods and slaves far below market price
  he strolled new orleans he attended
country balls in costly clothes with
gold-mounted weapons gold jingling in
his pockets he paid new orleans
most famous lawyer  gold to de-
fend him and won it back gambling
he recruited husky adventurous coun-
try youth to his fleet he helped the
needy with lavish hand he laughed al
pompous authority made others laugh
  governor claiborne plastered new
orleans with proclamations putting a
price on his head delivered at the cabil-
do next night jean lafitte plastered
the city with his own proclamations
putting a price on governor claibornes
head delivered at grande terre new
orleans still irked at her sale to the
young united states roared with laugh-
ter that was the way to treat that
 merican coquin that american ras-
cal the governor
  jean lafitte stirred their admiration
they knew that in the war of  the
british offered him pardon for his pira-
cies  gold a captains commis-
sion in the british navy if he would
join them against the americans reveal
his secret waterway to new orleans
  they knew how he kept the british
marking time while he warned gover-
nor claiborne and general andrew jack-
son how claibornes thanks was a raid
that looted and burned grande terre
how jackson called him and his men
hellish banditti they knew how in
spite of all that lafitte sent cannon
and cannoneers who fought the british
at the battle of new orleans january
  side by side with jackson and
claiborne in the same trench while la-
fitte guarded the barataria waterway
against british surprise
  the president of the united states
at old hickorys plea had pardoned
him for his piracies but jean lafitte
couldnt settle down he sailed to gal-
veston island off the texas coast built
another fort warehouse slave barra-
coons went sea-raiding again galves-
ton island was no mans land then
technically it belonged to texas which
belonged to mexico which was rebelling
against spain spain didnt concede
mexican independence until september
  nobody bothered jean la-
fitte

adventure
there in  young jim
bowie went and made his deal
with jean lafitte to buy every
slave the pirate could supply
at a flat rate of one dollar a pound that
averaged  a slave louisiana plant-
ers believed their plantations would go
wilderness again without slave labor
they paid from  to  each for
husky negroes slave prices were soar-
ing in 
  for it had become illegal then to im-
port african slaves into the united
states fast american sloops-of-war
shallow-draft gunboats patrolled the
coasts united states customs men kept
alert watch ashore but young jim
bowie had studied the law and found
the loophole
 under the law when an informer
tipped off the customs man and a
slave cargo was seized the slaves were
to be sold at public auction half the
money they brought went to the in-
former but more important yet the
slaves became legal property inside the
united states they could be transport-
ed bought sold galveston island was
only a short hop from the louisiana
coast there was a wide margin of
profit between  and the  to
 a slave would bring inside the
border
  jim bowie had figured out the plan
he put before his brothers they would
pool funds buy cheap through a dummy
an old but seaworthy schooner load-
ing it with slaves at galveston island
they would land it secretly on the louis-
iana coast they would go to the near-
est customs men and inform on them-
selves they had found an owner-
less abandoned slave cargo at the en-
suing auction a dummy would bid in
the slaves for them the three husky
bowie brothers woidd circulate among
possible bidders and make it a per-
sonal and unhealthy affair for any man
who tried to outbid them they would
get half their own money back as in-
formers then they would sell the
slaves on their slave-hungry plantations
up the bayous
 jim bowie in command the three
brothers plunged on black ivory they
lost just one cargo they beached it too
near a coastal indian village while
they were absent informing the customs
the indians freed the slaves and red and
black men fled to the swamps
  from  to  jim bowies per-
sonal profits were  it was a
fortune then as now he returned to
alexandria a capitalist he found ra-
pides feverish with land speculation
land-hungry immigrants were pouring
in louisiana cotton and sugar meant
swift wealth newlv-organized banks
were lavish with loans men bought
huge tracts of land sold them at huge
profits jim bowie sank his capital in
land borrowed money and bought more
real riches loomed
  visiting his brother rezin one day he
saw a knife he admired rezin had de-
signed it his plantation blacksmith
snowden had forged it from a steel bar
it was a weapon of unusual shape point-
ed single-edged with an oddly-curved
back planned to strengthen the nine-
inch blade with its six-inch haft a
man could use it as a hunting knife a
butchering knife or a fighting knife
jim bowie hefted and handled it ad-
mired it and rezin gave it to him
  knife or dagger duels were common
then under the code of honor men
faced each other each with knife in right
hand their left hands grasping opposite
corners of a bandana handkerchief and
at the signal started to cut thrust and
parry the man who let go the hand-
kerchief while alive and conscious went
branded a coward few men went out
unarmed jim bowie and his big
knife were part of the conversation in
rapides
bowie and his big knife

x rapides was hot with pas-
sionate politics in the s
two factions were bitter the
old-timers and the new-
comers thomas jefferson wells gen-
eral montfort wells samuel levi wells
and james madison wells four wealthy
brothers planters in the bayou boeuf
section were old-timers they were
close friends of jim bowie in that day
your friends enemies were your enemies
politically and personally
  william fristoe the old-timer sher-
iff of rapides died in office in 
the new-comers by some sharp po-
litical maneuvering got young major
norris wright appointed to fill the un-
expired term in  they managed to
elect him sheriff jim bowie had cam-
paigned hotly against him
  norris wright was slim pale frail
but he needed no pity he was the
deadliest pistol-shot in rapides his
courage and coolness under fire were ab-
solute he had fought five duels killed
his man in two of them he came from
baltimore to alexandria worked as
clerk in the general merchandise store
of martin  bryant he helped organize
a new bank in alexandria was elected
to its board of directors
  bad luck hit jim bowie several bad
crop years came in swift succession then
the floods overflowed his lands he
faced the fact that he must borrow
more money or lose his fortune he
went to the alexandria bank and
applied for a loan a few days later
to his incredulous wrath he was told the
loan had been refused he corked his
anger made quiet inquiries he learned
that the directors had been willing at
first to grant the loan but norris wright
had argued his fellow-directors into vot-
ing it down
  they met on an alexandria street a
few days later wright pulled his pis-
tol jim bowie rushed without drawing
weapon wright fired his bullet raked
jim bowies ribs but a second later
bowies big hands had closed on wright
jim tore the pistol from the sheriffs
hand and hurled it far then systematic-
ally he set about killing wright with
his bare hands he had pounded him
into unconsciousness and was choking
him to death when bystanders rushed
in and pulled them apart all rapides
knew now it was only a matter of time
before one killed the other
curious characters took the
stage before that time came
one was colonel robert a
crain he came from vir-
ginia to alexandria from dr john
rippy he rented a plantation on bayou
rapides he ran up bills when cred-
itors came to collect he challenged them
to duels for insulting a virginia gentle-
man dr rippy came to collect the
rent colonel crain offered his note
dr rippy said he preferred cash col-
onel crain shot and killed him for in-
sulting a virginia gentleman colonel
crain had allied himself politically with
sheriff wright and the new-comers
he was never arrested
  levin luckett complained to the
rapides grand jury that colonel crain
had taken some of lucketts negro
slaves outside the state of louisiana
that was serious the grand jury in-
dicted colonel crain before the case
came to trial luckett rode into alex-
andria and asked the district attorney
to withdraw the charge he had just
married colonel crains daughter he
explained he didnt want to prosecute
his father-in-law the district attorney
said he had no legal right to quash the
case sheriff wright was a political
power in the state capitol now the
louisiana legislature passed a bill
granting the district attorney of rapides
the right to quash the case against colo-
nel crain it was quashed
  next colonel crain persuaded rich-
mond e cuny rich planter of rapides
to endorse his note for  the
note fell due colonel crain defaulted

adventure
he was execution-proof the note-
holder sued the endorser won judg-
ment cuny had to sell slaves to pay
the debt ilis son general samuel
cuny took his shotgun and called on
colonel crain demanding that the vir-
ginia gentleman make good the colo-
nel refused the general shot the colo-
nel in the right arm and departed the
cuny and wells families were close
friends
  alfred blanchard and carey blanch-
ard brothers had come from virginia
to rapides settling on bayou jean de
jean they married into colonel crains
family alfred blanchard drank some-
what deeply one day and shot thomas
jefferson wells wounding him seriously
  nerves were getting taut in rapides
  dr thomas h maddox was one of
the most prominent physicians there
one who survives in history only as a
lady patient confided to him a spicy
piece of gossip involving general mont-
fort wells dr maddox passed it
along the story spread
  general montfort wells heard the
story traced it to dr maddox called
and demanded the name of the doctors
informant dr maddox refused to give
it hot words followed a few days
later general montfort wells a shot-
gun on his arm met dr maddox on a
public road in alexandria and without
a word opened fire the general was
notoriously the worst shot in rapides
he proved it then he missed dr mad-
dox and hit an innocent bystander on
the other side of the road
  dr maddox returned home and sent
his seconds to wait on general wells
with a formal challenge for a duel gen-
eral wells ignored the challenge
  colonel robert a crain that pep-
pery virginia gentleman stepped into
the situation he sent his own challenge
to general wells offering to substitute
for his medical friend
  general wells ignored that challenge
too
  colonel crain exploded with an ulti-
matum to general wells
  since you will not fight a duel like
a gentleman under the code of honor
we will make it a street fight the next
time you come into alexandria
  the wells brothers held family coun-
cil samuel levi wells bachelor broth-
er of general wells sent dr maddox
his acceptance of the doctors challenge
their seconds conferred they selected
pistols as the weapons the vidalia sand
bar as the place
  it was a no mans land thrusting out
from a thicket of willows into the mis-
sissippi river at vidalia on the louisi-
anan shore just across from the high
bluffs on which rose natchez mississip-
pi it stands there yet submerged only
in times of flood
fire and gunpowder never
were worse bedfellows than
the two parties that set out
for natchez
  with dr maddox went sheriff nor-
ris wright colonel robert a crain al-
fred blanchard carey blanchard and
dr denny a surgeon
  with samuel levi wells went his
brother thomas jefferson wells who
had been shot by alfred blanchard
james bowie who had been shot by
norris wright and had nearly killed him
barehanded general samuel cuny
who had shot colonel crain in the arm
trying to collect on that defaulted note
george c mcwhorter later to be state
treasurer of louisiana and dr cuny
brother of general samuel cuny as
their surgeon
  they slept at natchez the night of
september   shortly after dawn
they took the ferry to vidalia they
walked out on the sand bar by agree-
ment the two duellists each with a sec-
ond and a surgeon walked farther out
on the bar to fight while the other
friends stayed near the shore
  facing each other ten paces apart
bowie and his big knife

dr maddox and samuel levi wells ex-
changed shots twice they missed both
times then wells advanced with hand
outstretched the family courage proved
they shook hands duellists seconds
surgeons started for the willow-thicket
where refreshments had been provided
if peace should be the outcome but
those toasts were never drunk
  for jim bowie and general samuel
cuny saw samuel levi wells coming
toward them and stepped out to meet
him there was a stir among the group
of the friends of dr maddox they in-
terpreted the bowie-cuny advance as a
violation of the agreement they too
strode forth calling out belligerently
  general samuel cuny looked back and
saw colonel robert a crain striding
pugnaciously toward him
  remembering what this mans de-
faulted note had cost his father general
cuny drew his pistol
  colonel crain drew his pistol fired
missed general cuny and shot jim
bowie through the hip general cuny
fired his pistol and hit colonel crain in
the upper arm
  then the bloodless duel became a
bloody battle
  jim bowie drew his big knife he
started for colonel crain who had
drawn a second pistol dr cuny the
surgeon had seized his brother general
samuel cuny and was striving to keep
him out of the mele but general
cuny wrenched himself free and empty
pistol in hand rushed at colonel crain
crain fired general cuny fell he died
a few minutes later
  jim bowies speed was retarded by
that pistol ball in his hip but steadily
inexorably knife in hand he advanced
on colonel crain they came face to
face colonel crain clubbed his empty
pistol and smashed at jim bowies head
trying to brain him with the butt
blood poured from a long gash the wea-
pon opened in jims scalp
  jim bowie staggered back sank to
his knees but he rose he wiped the
streaming blood from his eyes with his
coat sleeve grimly he bored in again
his right hand held the knife point up
as a fencer holds a foil his left hand
reached for a grip on his foe
  it was too much for the redoubtable
colonel crain that virginia gentle-
man turned and ran like a rabbit
  again jim bowie wiped his eyes clear
of blood now he saw major norris
wright sheriff of rapides advancing on
him with an unsheathed sword-cane in
his hand why the deadly pistol-shot
used a sword-cane that day no man will
ever know

adventure
  wright luaged jim bowie strove to
parry with his knife-blade blit missed
the sword-cane blade short triangular
grooved needle-pointed ran him through
the chest wright wrenched to recover
it the blade broke off in the wound
  in that fleeting moment jim bowies
empty left hand got its grip on his en-
emy his knife-blade went to work
when he released his left-handed grip
i dead man dropped to the sand the
howie-wright feud had ended
  then they found alfred blanchard
wounded by a pistol ball nobody ever
knew who shot him
  they buried norris wright and sam-
uel cuny side by side they ferried the
three wounded men back to natchez
the wounds of crain and blanchard
were trivial but the doctors said jim
bowie would die by morning he fooled
them
  during his convalescence he visited
captain reese fitzpatrick the famous
natchez gunsmith and armorer the
two improved the original weapon cap-
tain fitzpatrick left the specifications
  weight one pound total length
fifteen inches blade nine inches haft
six inches one edge lower third of
edge curves convex to meet needle-point
lower third of back curves concave to
meet point blade must be forged so it
quivers at touch of hand must have
spring and rebound of damascus sword
edge must be keen as lightning-flash
  captain fitzpatrick and general felix
houston worked out a device that fas-
tened the bowie-knife to a rifle-muzzle
like a bayonet the weapon became
enormously popular cutlers worked
overtime forging to fill orders men
said of the true bowie-knife that you
could drive its point through a silver
dollar without turning the edge side
by side with the american repeating
rifle and six-shooter it went with the
frontier helped win the west
jim bowie recovered and
returned to rapides he
found popular sentiment there
against him stung to the
quick he sold his last acre and slave
and went to texas
  he prospered at first in san an-
tonio he married children were born
but a sudden pestilence left jim bowie a
childless widower tuberculosis attacked
his giant frame he sought excitement
anywhere lashed his ravaged body 
with whisky when the texans rose in
rebellion against mexico under general
sam houston he joined them
  side by side with buck travis he
helped defend the alamo helping
mount a cannon  a platform inside
the walls he slipped fell was hurt bad-
ly then an icy norther smote the
one hundred eighty-one texans who
were holding four thousand mexicans at
bay jim bowie went down with pneu-
monia
  they propped him up on his cot that
morning of march   when general
antonio lopez de santa anna raging
because he had been held at bay since
february  by this handful of men
hurled his full force at the alamos
walls twice incredibly the one hun-
dred eighty-one repulsed the four thou-
sand then the mexicans came swarm-
ing over
  on that cot unable to stand jim
bowie was one of the last five americans
to die he was still propped up on his
cot knife in hand two empty pistols on
the floor a rampart of dead mexicans in
front of him when a mexican soldier
stood in the doorway and shot him
  his enemies knew him drunk with
blood and victory they tossed his shat-
tered body on their bayonets as farm-
ers with pitchforks toss hay
 and no man knows what became of
the knife of the man whose name it bears
to this day after it dropped from his
lifeless hand when that bullet pierced
his heart
talbt mundy gives us more side-
lights on the settings of his novel-
ettes of tros
  one of the things i like especially
about mundys historical yarns is their
apparent modernity his characters are
motivated by the same deep and funda-
mental emotions that motivate all the
people we know when tros gets mad
it isnt for some mystic or involved his-
torical reason-anybody then or now
would get hot about the collar the fact
that tros wears no collar and the rest
of us do makes no difference at all it
doesnt occur to us
  also the conversation is natural a
number of historical stories come to our
magazine and most of them make you
pant for air in a cloud of mummy dust
prithee say all the popinjays and the
writer tangles you in ruffles trips you
over harquebuses confounds and con-
fuses you with halidoms and bodkins
until a poor reader who is just an inno-
cent fellow trying to follow a story col-
lapses with a clank upon the rivets in his
lower backplate while the contents of a
museum are being dumped upon his
dented capeline and all the macaronis
are saying in chorus fie fie
  we have to put a pox and postage
upon a good many historical stories be-
cause only historians could understand
them
t wonder how many people who read his-
tory for fun which is the only way to
read have noticed the so to speak spiritual
resemblance between cleopatra and queen
elizabeth of england there are some imagin-
the
camp-fire
where readers writers and
adventurers meet
ative students of history who maintain with a
good deal of logical argument that queen
elisabeth may have been a reincarnation of
cleopatra that may be sense or nonsense
but it is at least an interesting theory
  i have imagined tros as a sort of spiritual
ancestor of sir francis drake who could not
possibly have got away for his famous voyage
around the world without the queens knowl-
edge consent and assistance like elizabeth
cleopatra was determined to hold her throne
against all comers at anyones expense
  cleopatra finds it fairly easy to delay tros
departure by compelling him to do herculean
chores her own job was so difficult that she
had plenty of excuse for as tros describes it
cat-and-mousing him she was too clever and
not wise enough to deal with him straight-
forwardly her character is changing very
swiftly now that she is maturing and no
longer has caesar to direct her policy what
she needs is a man her whole reign is the
story of a womans need for a man to supply
the qualities which she lacks given the right
man to lead her armies she might have be-
come the greatest ruler the world has ever
known a naturally gay and high-spirited
girl well aware of her genius and of the im-
portance of sex in a world of warriors and
perfectly aware that rome intends to grab
egypt at the first opportunity she changes in
spite of her natural charm into a treacherous
and cynically ruthless despot that tros wont
even pretend to love her mortifies her that
he loves her sister enrages her but she is
practical since he wont be her lover he shall
be her unofficial agent whether he likes it or
not i imagine that not less than ninety per
cent of the scandalous tales about cleopatra
when they were not the pure inventions of
scandal-mongers were based on her efforts to
find a man fit to share her throne
  the following random notes may be of in-
terest the shipwrights of rhakotis which
was the western quarter of the city of alex-
andria turned out excellent vessels built of
cedar imported from lebanon their skill was


adventure
developed by the demand for ships that could
carry huge cargoes of corn-the jewish resi-
dential quarter was at the eastern end of
the city but they were not forbidden to do
business elsewhere and most of the big fac-
tories and warehouses had fallen into jewish
hands-the egyptian government of that
day had a very highly developed banking sys-
tem but private hoards of gold of any con-
siderable quantity were kept in the temples
where they were safe enough except from in-
vasion by an alien army the jews however
in alexandria and all through the levant
conducted a very efficient banking system of
their own
  the ancient world thoroughly despised
sailors who were treated more or less as
animals and behaved themselves accordingly
war crews were marines that is to say
soldiers detailed for duty at sea they too
despised the real seamen i have imagined
tros as having different ideas about it-
there was probably no port in the world at
that time excepting alexandria where tros
had friends and money where he could have
put in for repairs to his trireme without being
plundered piracy was a major industry and
governments were just as bad pirates as any-
one else his trireme would certainly have
been seized at any roman port pigeon post
was very highly developed news traveled by
that means from temple to temple at great
speed this gave the priests a political value
that they might have found otherwise hard
to sustain-most historians of the period seem
to have overlooked the importance of cassius
in the near east anthony octavian and
lepidus shelved their mutual hatred and
formed the triumvirate in rome simply and
solely because cassius held a key-position in
syria and was likely to become strong enough
to defeat all three of them had cassius who
was one of caesars murderers been a man of
caesars genius and guts he could easily have
seized egypt after he became proconsul in
syria and with all that enormous wealth at
his disposal he could almost certainly have
defeated antony and octavian but cassius
was a piker he wasted his time raping syria
and palestine imposing impossible taxes and
trying through spies and agents to start
something in egypt that would give him an
excuse to invade cleopatra who couldnt
possibly have resisted an invasion by even
live or six roman legions was too clever for
him and much too wise to trust her own cor-
rupt and mercenary army
  buying cheap slaves putting them to school
and selling them as expert accountants but-
lers dancers acrobats actors prostitutes and
so forth was one of the most profitable in-
dustries of the period
  india was an almost unknown country but
the trade with india had already assumed im-
portance weapons of war from alexandria be-
ing- the principal goods sent in exchange for
indian silks and spices india was a good
market too for cleopatras emeralds which
were a royal monopoly
  in a country as highly organized but weakly
militarized as egypt the system of holding
hostages was all-important the greek upper
classes of such cities as heliopolis and mem-
phis who were savagely taxed and exasper-
ated by all sorts of impositions were re-
strained from too much treason and almost
altogether from rebellion by the fact that
their sons and daughters were at court where
they had to be extravagantly supported by
their parents their lives would have been
instantly forfeited if their parents had been
caught in rebellion patriotism and even
nationalism had not yet been invented hut
family ties were immensely strong
  very little is actually known about char-
mion beyond that she and iras are said to
have died with the queen iras who may have
been the queens hairdresser was a persian
but charmion was a greek and perhaps a
virgin i have imagined her as in love with
tros and more bitter against him for re-
fusing to love the queen than for rejecting her
own acidulous embraces charmion was
probably a pious aristocrat-perhaps a sort
of alexandrine dar developing into a man-
hater and a very zealous spy
  to the greek alexandrine egypt was a
land of dark mystery from which he drew his
revenues even cleopatra spirited adven-
turess though she was during all her reign
is only known to have made one journey up
the nile
  i invented boidion there is absolutely no
historical proof of the existence of any such
woman but royal bastards were as frequent
as almost any other royal indiscretion and
there were numbers of pretenders to the
throne of egypt most of whom came to a vio-
lent end after feeble efforts to gain a follow-
ing i may have actually invented a real
character i feel jiositive that someone really
was substituted for arsinoe although it would
take too much space to give my reasons fox-
believing it
  nearly all rebellions and revolutions begin
with very small numbers they only become
dangerous after the first substantial success
-the treason of such a man as alexis is
quite typical of the period caesar had the
same sort of experience with his intimates
the camp fire

whole armies used to change sides and al-
legiance in the course of a day
  cleopatra believed that the whole of syria
was rightfully hers her suggestion that tros
should make himself king of syria was logic-
ally sound
  alexandria was the home of ribald song
and many of the songs were sacrilegious
  tros solution of the arsinoe-boidion prob-
lem was of course stark treason liven though
the queen had given him discretion he cer-
tainly stretched it beyond tolerable limits and
laid himself open if discovered to any ven-
geance she should care to impose that she
was willing to put him to work again instead
of having him executed suggests that she
had far more guts than any other ruler of
that day
g frederic pelham jr tells us
 of his background for the strange
events in his story the kitten
  i left my home in westchester county in
 at the age of sixteen and headed west
i spent months in montana wyoming and
thereabouts riding fences surveying the des-
ert for irrigation projects building railroads
into the sugar beet territory threshing wheat
and waiting on tables in boarding houses for
my grub and a can of tobacco a week com-
ing home i went to the other extreme and
studied art for a couple of years until i
landed a job surveying the lehigh valley
railroad from new york to buffalo i quit
this job to go to the mexican border with the
national guard in  the next year was
spent in spartansburg s c with the regi-
ment which sailed for france early in 
  i was on the british front for several
months where i won a commission and was
transferred to the american front just in
time to get into the chateau thierry stunt
and receive a piece of h e in the right hip
juvigny followed where our outfit formed
the spear-head for mangins th french
army in its attack at the chemin des dames
the foreign legion and the moroccans re-
lieved us going over our heads and into the
leaden hail like boy scouts on a hike then
they shoved us into the argonne where we
cracked the kriemhilde-stellung i pulled out
after twenty days of it with a dose of mus-
tard gas and a m g bullet in my left knee
  after hospitalization i was made an in-
structor in the officers training school out-
side of lyons after the armistice i trans-
ferred back to my original division came
home and severed my connections with the
military at once and forever
  the story of the kitten is based upon
actual facts our scout platoon lieutenant
and thirteen of his men met their deaths near
itomange in the argonne as described in the
story i simply transferred the locale to the
british front and worked up the explanation
from the german side in the only way that 
could figure their deaths to have occurred
the kitten is incidentally my first piece
of fiction to be published
 a ustin phelps of orlando flor-
ida gives us a close-up of an ask
adventure expert
  i wonder how many of even the regular
readers realize the amount of care and re-
search going into an ask adventure reply
  ive read adventure twenty years and have
occasionally written for advice the reply i
took as a matter of course as i believe the
majority of the users of this service do
  but when moving to this section from the
north i found that if i was to continue my
habits of roaming thru the woods it would
be necessary to know something of immedi-
ate first aid treatment of snake bite now
before the chamber of commerce hops on
me ill admit i have yet to see a snake with-
in five miles of town but when you go into
swamp country-well hapsburg liebe will
have to make you believe that story
  i started to write dr fordyce and learned
he had moved to this identical town he re-
sponded to my letter and enclosed a personal
note and two days later dropped in when i
returned his visit i had a chance to see the
pains that man takes to make his information
accurate and up-to-date
  honestly he must have moved down here
with two freight trains from floor to ceil-
ing along one side of a  x  room are
portable book racks that hold medical texts
books on outdoor life many his own and
authoritative works on motor boating camp-
ing and health the other wall is pretty well
taken up with blue print files of tents and
camping equipment kits and first aid sets
fill a bin the full length of the room and in
the garage and on the premises are exactly
twenty-seven types of tents undergoing tests
mess kits and water containers occupy still
another section and his correspondence files
would do justice to a small insurance office
  he laid before me letter after letter from
manufacturers of snake bite equipment from
the laboratories producing antivenin from
acknowledged leaders in the handling of snake
bite cases from all parts of the world to
top it off we visited the van merebeke labora-

adventure
tories and saw dissections of rattler and moc-
casin heads and vials with fangs of different
type and shape showing the different methods
of introduction of the venom we saw tables
of the amount injected at each strike and
the amount of antivenin necessary to neu-
tralize it in both test tube and body potency
of the antivenin after keeping for periods of
years were shown different types of suction
syringes were on display and actual samples
of the venom
  now all this you might consider a pretty
complete return for a three ccnt stamp but
doc had another one to pull he had heard
of a  foot rattler taken from a nearby
swamp and moccasins larger than your thigh
and nothing would satisfy him but that we
must make a tour thru these swamps and
actually observe the snake his action when
disturbed when aroused and just how far he
really could strike privately i think he went
with a faint wish that one of us would be
bitten that he might try out the kits in a
practical field demonstration
  securing the aid of nelson a local natural-
ist we started into an almost impenetrable
swamp it was my first introduction to a
snakes home on such intimate circumstances
as at times it was easier to crawl thru the
vines and palmettos and the element of sur-
prise was all in favor of the snake but doc
just reveled in it
  im sorry to report that we saw but five
snakes and could catch none but your first
aid editor was not long discouraged so now
were to take a motor boat up the st johns
right into the jungle and if we dont meet
snakes there-
trom henry t brummett of long
beach california comes a letter
about the herd of chinchillas being de-
veloped at sea-level in this country after
coming from the cold thin air of the
highest andes
  i ant writing to correct an article on chin-
chillas in your magazine printed in answer to
a question by mr w o greenleaf of san
jose calif this article or letter was so very
far wrong that i felt called upon to correct it
  chinchillas genuine south american can
and arc being raised profitably in captivity-
right here in california i might add that this
is the only place outside of south america
they are being raised
  in  a law was passed in chile for-
bidding trapping chinchillas for pelts or ex-
port this law was passed covering a period
of five years and has been extended for
another period of five years there have been
passed similar laws in peru and bolivia since
 this information was given me by
the american consul generals located in all
the above mentioned countries i was also
informed that the animals cost  each
captured alive-price may be slightly higher
in case of a particularly desirable specimen i
wrote other countries in south america but
was informed that chinchillas were to be found
only in the above named countries
  contrary to mr youngs reply-chinchilla
fur has very long hair measuring from one
to two inches in length the skin is not tough
-in fact it is less tough and durable than
rabbit fur and is so rated by furriers the
hair is unbelievably fine and grows in little
tufts similar to a milkweed tassel where it
joins the skin this peculiar fact and the fine-
ness of the individual hairs accounts for the
utter impossibility of successfully imitating
genuine chinchilla fur this fur ranges in
color from a light slate-gray to a dark blue-
gray the latter is worth more i have quota-
tions from several leading fur houses of from
 to  a pelt i should say that the aver-
age price for prime chinchilla would be in the
neighborhood of  chinchillas raised
here in the us are not as yet being pelted
and placed on the open market the entire
output at present is more or less destined for
sale as breeding animals the price for a
proven pair of breeders is 
  chinchillas are of about the same size as a
large gray squirrel and are members of the ro-
dent family they are found above the 
foot level in the andes it takes time and
patience to acclimatize them to sea-level at-
mosphere the man who originally brought
them to this country started with  pairs and
finally arrived with  females and  males
which formed the nucleus of the present herd
of more than  chinchillas i might also
say that there would have been many more
had not  of the best of the flock been stolen
in  and taken out of the country only
one of this group of  animals is alive today
these animals breed as often as three times a
year they are entirely vermin-free-in fact
vermin just cant seem to get off fast enough
when placed in chinchilla fur i imagine this
is partially on account of the extreme fine-
ness of the hair they are purely vegetarian
and seem to thrive on nearly anything

hutchinson secretary of the lake pen-
age fish and game association of
whitefish ontario
  after waiting two weeks for the ice to go
out we got a load of mail about the first
thing always is to grab adventure and turn
to camp-fire before looking over the rest
  first i was much interested in gordon
maccreaghs note on black panthers frank
buck has brought some twenty of them to
the united states claims they are the same
size as the spotted ones and shows a picture
of a black and a spot drinking together
  this of course may mean nothing hut lie
says that the spots have been known to pro-
duce blacks in india southern china africa
and to the point of practically establishing a
new species in malaya where they outnumber
the spots
  with all due respect to carl hagenbeck
it looks as though the black is a sport
  paul eipper in animals looking at you
tells of a baby black that was raised by a
bitch he tells us that at first it resembled
a grey woolen ball soon to have spots show
and then change to shining black
  turning over the page i came on to the
article by yourself telling about the case of
a bear and a dog being chummy and asking
for further evidence of such queer buddies
  two years ago we had two cub bears at
our camp and about one hundred fishermen
from the states witnessed the antics of these
bears with trapper a small black dog that
looked as if it were trying to be a spaniel
trapper was an indian dog given to our six
year old son when he took the rifle carried
by an indian and shot a full sized bear
the indian was so surprised that he just
stammered and said bay-i give you my
dog
  these cubs to get back to the subject were
cross and about the only animals we ever
tried to tame without success yet they loved
the dog
  they tried to play with him but he seemed
to resent any undue familiarity and when
they tried to roll him over he would go to
war pronto and scare the bears so that they
simply rolled over backwards out of the way
when we finally turned the bears loose they
refused to run away or to come near us but
tagged around with the dog
  many thanks to comrades bowen and
hutchinson it is clear that suspicion
can go too far as in the case of this
editor and that newfoundland dog leo

the orient is mysterious but not
with the mystery of secret societies
  request-i should like information on
secret societies of chinese women and the
names of books dealing with the subject
-h a dowler empress canada
  reply by mr seward cramer- hate to
disappoint you but you have asked about a
subject that is practically non-existent wom-
en in china have only recently come out of
the home and into public life for centuries
all women of any standing spent their entire
life within the homes of their fathers or hus-
bands the only women seen were coolie-
women farm workers or boat women and
they never made themselves noticed the only
women to appear in public were sing-song
girls and prostitutes and they were restricted
in their movements it is only within recent
times that all types of women have appeared
in public
  with the advent of communism and the
revolution some womens societies have
sprung up but very little is known of them
as they are political in nature to my knowl-
edge these are the only secret societies to
which women have been admitted in china
  the guild system has been prevalent in
china since long before the days of marco
polo but the basis of this system has been the
family but these guilds were not secret so-
cieties as we understand the term they were
rather associations of craftsmen and artisans
  the tong groups that we have in america
have no counterpart in china as a matter of
fact i dont think that returning members of
a tong are still held to owe allegiance to their
chiefs there have been attempts to start a
masonic fraternity in china but they are not
sanctioned by the grand lodges
  there are only two organizations that might
come within your meaning they are the
tai-pings and the boxers both were revolu-
tionary in aspect the former were religious
fanatics in addition any good history of
china would give a discussion of them i
might recommend particularly wilhelms
history of china two other books are
reinsch intellectual and political develop-
ment of the far east and w j hail tseng
kuo-fen and the tai-ping rebellion
a specific question and a speci-
fic answer-about ballistics
  request-can a - cartridge be fired
from a - rifle if so will the bottle neck
of the shell be blown swelled or possibly
split
  my understanding is that being the same

ask adventure

size diameter bullet and taking the same size
bore the - can be fired in a rifle cham-
bered for a - there will lie a space that
will allow a flip between the position of the
shorter - shell and the chamber for the
- and doubtless will upset the ballistics
and lose much of the effectiveness of the shot
hut it will still punish severely at point blank
range the - shell not fitting snug into
the chamber will have a little space around
the neck that will be open and with the ex-
plosion of the charge will swell or blow until
filling the larger chamber-possibly split this
would be at once apparent if trying to fit the
- shell so fired into a - chamber and
the shell would not go in but would be like
u swelled case that causes a machine gun
stoppage i recall that the  mm ammunition
of the french would fire in the german 
mm gun but not vice versa and as the charge
and length of shell is the principal difference
between the - and - would not it
be as outlined above
-c e kearney los angeles calif
  reply by mr donegan wiggins-i have
just been experimenting to find what i can
tell you
  my advice is dont do it it can be done
for i just did it by the only really depend-
able method viz seating a case in the breech
of my krag and firing it
  the base of the case is swollen and a slot
is split in it a half inch long with a quarter
inch one at right angles to the first the case
is distorted a bit and the forward part has
swollen to the dimensions of the krag or
- case neck the bullet passed through
the bore all right and on into the pile of fire-
wood
  there was a lot of gas leakage the bolt-
face and the breech of the barrel in the re-
ceiver being well blackened and there was
considerable escape of gas through the port
and receiver well
  it can be done but is decidedly not a suc-
cess i think there is danger both to the rifle
and the firer if this is attempted i doubt if
any accuracy would be present in such a
combination at any rate
spheres the gurgling spring and
yonder perhaps the gold and
heres the law to join the two
  request-my partners and i have been
prospecting a group of claims in nevada
they are situated in the foothills overlooking
a desert there is no water for several miles
except a group of springs about a half mile
up-hill from our location if we do strike any-
thing on the claims worthwhile its value is
lessened by the lack of water we would like
to file on the springs to insure a supply of
water but the ground between is apparently
barren of minerals as are the springs al-
though they are on government property as
well as the land in between the claims and
the springs
  what we want to do is to make available
water for our needs including a right-of-way
from the springs to the claims
  what do you suggest
-r h forney lakeport calif
  reply by mr victor shaw-the natural
procedure in acquiring water to use on any
type of mining claim is to take out a water
right at any point where the water is avail-
able if as your letter states the springs lie
uphill from your claims there should be no
difficulty in conveying that water to the claims
by ditch flume or pipeline or all three in con-
junction the chief preliminary would of
course be to determine by estimate of the
amount of water in the springs whether they
will afford all you require at all times espe-
cially in dry season
  taking out a water right is a simple process
but three things must always exist to consti-
tute a valid appropriation of the water in-
tention to apply it to a valid use its diversion
from natual channel by ditch pipe etc its
application within reasonable period
  the last element doesnt entail unusual ef-
fort or expenditure the law is rather vague
on this point stating that due diligence must
be used to afford water at the project in a
reasonable time-this depending upon cir-
cumstances in each case the right to use docs
not begin with the actual use of the water but
is as of the date when the locator constructs
his dam ditch flume etc or starts to build
them providing the enterprise is carried on
with reasonable diligence
  procedure notice is posted at a point
where water is taken out copy is filed with
local recording office within ninety days
ditch flume or pipeline or all three must be
surveyed and actual work begun on it the
notice should contain and state the number
of miners inches desired to use the location
of point of diversion the place where it is to
be used the purpose for which it is to be
used with of course the date and name of
the locators printed forms of such notices
can be obtained for a nickel at stores carry-
ing legal blanks one point is that in divert-
ing water from any stream it must be after
use returned to its natural channel though i

adventure
cant see how that could apply to your spring
source nor do i believe it will
  the locating of any type of mining claims
to cover the entire source and line of convey-
ance to point of use doesnt give title to that
water nor protect your sole use of it in law
that is if you should locate an association
group of placers to cover the ground and
another party files a legal water right on the
source they cannot be prevented in law from
using any part or all the water if needed
you can use water flowing over land to which
you have title but have thereby no legal rights
in that water as against one who has a right
toes any reader know about this
   queer fish
  request-my request pertains to that elu-
sive and rather unknown sea fish the grun-
yon or is it grunion i am told that dur-
ing the late months of the year in califor-
nia generally autumn these fish run it seems
the run must occur under highly peculiar cir-
cumstances high tide and full moon must
coincide then if the fish are willing the run
takes place they forthwith ride in on the
waves and spawn on the sand
  at any rate at the forecast of a grunyon-
run the beaches are crowded with people lying
in wait for the grunyon they brandish wet
gunny sacks and splash around in the back-
wash of waves supposedly collecting them a
catch may run as high as forty or so by the
way they are im told silver in color and
range in size anywhere from three to seven
inches
  now to the queer part i have questioned
many people who have participated in grun-
yon hunts some have claimed to have seen
them sparkling in the moonlight others claim
to have eaten them but i cannot find a single
person who when pinned down will admit
ever having caught any
  is there such a thing as a grunyon and can
you tell me something about them
-paul b stillman glendale calif
  reply by mr john thompson-i can give
you no more information on the subject of the
grunyon than what you have it has been a
very elusive fish for me and all my inquiries
have brought just about the same results as
yours suggest to settle the matter you write
your fish commissioner
t ook at mount mckinley before you
- leap to mount everest
  request-i plan to go to the alaskan
range to test my mountain climbing ability
and prepare for a more difficult and a greater
conquest naturally mount mckinley offers
a challenge
  how many times and when has mckinley
been climbed since hudson stuck first as-
cended it are there any printed books on
ascent of it since the one of which stuck is
the author
  my reason is the same as of all who love
the snowy peaks mckinley is the first step of
a five-year dream-that of climbing mount
everest i am well aware that it is a fantas-
tic one but not for me doctors have pro-
nounced me physically fit and if i can make
sure of myself on mckinley even though i do
not ascend it i shall turn to everest two
other men are with me what is the ideal
number of climbers i put it at three what
mixture of liquid fuel do you prefer solid
which in your opinion weight and burning
hours considered is the best
  if i can ascend mount mckinley which is
a greater height from base to summit than
everest i shall feel that i have more than a
gambling chance
  the problem of mount everest from study-
ing accounts of the different expeditions
seems to be more of a physiological one than
of merely mountaineering difficulties perfect
acclimatization seems to be the answer
-james s crews fort sill okla
  reply by mr t s solomons-i am much
interested in your ambition to scale the sum-
mit of everest i explored first climbed and
named many major mountain peaks in the
west here and know something of the game
i was younger then and held life more ignor-
antly if not more lightly it is a fact which
you may find strange that notwithstanding
my name has been in this magazines list of
experts as authority on alaska and on moun-
taineering yours is about the third or fourth
inquiry i have had on the latter subject in the
eighteen years i have been serving this depart-
ment and i am sorry i cannot offhand
answer all your questions i have not the
printed data here
  hudson stuck published his book in 
as you probably know and belmore brown
the year earlier the mountain was climbed
a couple of years ago you may remember
in a very expert and efficient manner but i
forget the names of the men i have no doubt
that the mountain has been climbed the one
peak or the other by a number of parties
since hudson stucks time while it is some-
what of a feat to succeed the fact that no
ask adventure

publicity may have been given to such ex-
peditions can reasonably be attributed to the
dislike of many climbers to such publicity
strong active men who are experienced in
snow and ice travel and are patient and intelli-
gent can climb practically any mountain at
very higli altitudes however it is as you say
an almost purely physiological problem here
the above qualities yield in importance to
idiosyncrasy-the possession of a singularly
well fitted heart lung and other organic
equipment however to your questions
  judge wickersham has compiled in recent
years a very complete bibliography of alaska
in its every phase drawn from every species
of published data undoubtedly you would
find therein practically everything except
mere fugitive second or third class newspaper
allusion ever printed referring to mckinley
another source might be the mazamas club of
portland or is it seattle and the sierra
club mills tower san fransciseo of which
i	have been a member since its organization

name for specialized information referring
both to mckinley and everest
  as to liquid fuels the sierra boys may be
more up to date on that personally i prefer
a high grade gasoline used in a can i make
myself designed and perforated very care-
fully into which  place sand when in use
however special studies must have been made
and i think the sierra club could refer you
to them my ideal number of actual climbers
meaning porters aside is either two or three
depending on conditions for the rope three
is undoubtedly better than two for most
other conditions two in my opinion is better
than three id hesitate to say as to mckinley
though i have a feeling that two for the final
ascent would be at least as good as three
again team work of a trio who have been
together a great deal might be better than
with two who are not perfectly coordinated
if i were to attack everest id scheme out a
way to put a first class well-equipped camp as
high as possible i think thats one answer to
the riddle
