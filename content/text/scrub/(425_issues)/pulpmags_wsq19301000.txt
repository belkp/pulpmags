flushed by running and his blond hair
somewhat ruffled he was addressing a tall
slender bespectacled and likewise blond ameri

 the motor started and the american pulled

  i should advise you not to do that i should
have to duck you under water until you had lost

  after a pause during which the two sat silent-
ly opposite each other while the speed boat sped

 through the harbor like an arrow korus said
 from the new york heraldv

 burg answered the american

  berlin press said korus

 after a pause korus continued what is new

  no you are i tell you my name and you

  they had left
the bay and with
the speed of an ex-
press train the mot-
orboat was racing
out on the ocean
as brilliant as a
mirror this evening
with its waves
foaming up high
and breaking in
white spray over
the two reporters
while the chinese
sailor stood motion-
less at the wheel in
his oilskins

youthful slender black-haired with a dainty
face and intelligent eyes

   on the platform beside the great blackboard
on which a strange airship was drawn stood
waldemar apel he was a typically energetic
german in the prime of life his speech was
short firm definite and convincing he con-
cluded his discourse thus

  now i merely have to show you briefly the
form of the space rocket depicted here which
is to make its first ascent tomorrow at noon in
general it follows the ideas and plans of the
german scientist herman oberth to limit the
weight to the very minimum and at the same
time to obtain the greatest possible rigidity and

ability to resist the

  the cliff house

co an immeasur-
ably splendid even-
ing with the flower

rather haughty
structure all in

music in the open
air young ladies in
the most modern
dancing frocks all

the gilded youth of san francisco and the best
negro orchestra in california far below on the
sea-washed rocks the traditional seals with won-
dering eyes at the back of the house was a
quiet hall its doors and windows were care-
fully secured to keep out the merry sounds of
the dance music there was an assemblage of
serious men scientists astronomers technicians
from all over the world in the front row was a
short thin wrinkled man of some seventy years
joe allister the petroleum king who was giving
the million

  beside him sat his only remaining child his
twenty-two year-old daughter irene allister

 most writers of moon stories have seen as
 the most interesting part of an interplane-
 tary adventure the conflict of our race with
 a new and strange civilization they assume that
 the moon venus mars or some other planet is in-
 habited and proceed to construct excellent stories
 about the probable adventures our earthlings
 would have

   the present story however is a complete excep-
 tion von hanstein does not at all deviate from
 what we actually know about the moon-that it
 is by turns intensely cold and intensely hot-that
 it has two weeks of night and two weeks of day
 that it is lifeless airless and indeed a most desol-
 ate dead world what would happen then he asks
 if some space voyagers found themselves stranded
 on this dead world how could they live and if
 they did live what would be the effect on their
 health and their nerves of the terrible desolation
 the unending monotony of the lunar world would
 they go maid and try to kill each other would
 they revert to savagery

   these are questions that must be answered if
 space travel is to really come and our author dots
 assure them we must face the facts the diffi-
 culties as our good author gives them to us gloomy
 as they are but there is a brighter side to his
 picture too there is humor as well as tragedy
 bravery and the thrill of dashes across hundreds
 of thousands of miles of empty space in this most
 exciting and real of interplanetary stories

immense initial
pressure to which
the ship will be ex-
posed on starting
the entire hull of
the ship has been
made so far as
metal is concerned
of beryllium this
has been produced
for the first time
i n considerable
amounts b y the
german professors
stock and gold-
schmidt it is extra-
ordinarily lighter
and at the same
time much harder
than aluminum

   to be sure it is
a very costly sub-
stance for you
know that the
green emerald the
bluish green aqua-
marine and finally
the ruby and sap-
phire as well are
nothing but crystal-
lized forms of
beryllium the
rocket which has
approximately the
shape of an artil-
lery shell had to
have extraordinary
dimensions to be capable of enough of a load
though only one man takes the risk of being the
first to undertake the gigantic flight the rocket
is really built to take three or four passengers
its length is no less than thirty-five meters its
breadth six meters

a hazardous undertaking

 a t the very bow are empty spaces which
are to allow the ship to remain afloat in
water behind is the cabin of the operator and
the passengers from here all the steering de-

	about  iett
 about  ft
between earth and moon

vices and all the necessary apparatus are man-
aged by levers

  here in wall cabinets are also the food sup-
plies the diving suits the cylinders of oxygen
and lastly a small supply of oxygen and hydro-
gen kept in metal bottles the extreme rear end
of the rocket is only loosely attached here are
again reproduced on a smaller scale in the form
of an auxiliary rocket all the exhausts which are
to propel the ship this auxiliary rocket is to
give the ship its initial velocity and then after
its fuel supply is exhausted it is to be released
from the main ship by the pressure of a lever
which sets in motion some sharp knives thus
casting it off only then that is to say when
high up in space begins the rocket explosions
which are caused by the flowing out of our gas
mixture to give the rocket its steady flight

  you see the entire rear part of the ship filled
with the pumps and all the apparatus pertaining
to the operation of the rocket you see the
gyroscopic steering devices around the ship and
of course i do not need to tell you that the en-
tire ship is assured against any loss of heat by
means of newly invented insula-
tion layers

  gentlemen there is no doubt
that this rocket would be able to
reach distant bodies in space the
moon our neighboring planets

at present that is not our pur-
pose tomorrow we will make a
trial flight which is particularly
to demonstrate the ability to di-
rect the course of the rocket the
courageous man who will dare
this first flight will ascend only
a little beyond the atmosphere
and will then describe a semi-
circle over the earth at a velocity
of about two thousand kilometers
an hour landing again in the in-
dian ocean not far from mada-
gascar probably sooner than our
boldest fancies imagine

  i have the honor to invite you
for this first trial flight to the
little island new atlantis recent-
ly structed by us in the ocean from iron and con-
crete to which our steamer will transport you
tomorrow morning at eight oclock finally i
have the additional honor of naming our bold
pilot and of presenting him to you

  dr egon helmstatter may i ask you to step
forward

  a young man about twenty-five years old
a slender wiry person with an energetic face and
determined eyes stepped upon the platform in
some embarrassment and bowed to the assem-
blage

  at this moment while there was a loud burst
of applause irene allister uttered a short cry

  he was in the back garden of cliff house
not where the dancing couples were crowding
under the electric lights to the tunes of the
negro orchestra but where the cliff was bordered
by only a narrow iron rail offering a splendid

view of the foaming sea and the brilliant harbor
of san francisco it was lonely here those
who were not dancing were crowding around
waldemar apel the ingenious inventor of the
rocket around joe allister who had freely spent
a million dollars around the blackboard with
the picture of the strange ship to be sure the
actual leading character dr egon helmstatter
was no longer in the hall it was he who was
standing alone out there on the cliff looking out
into the distance he felt strange but not wor-
ried he did not regret his decision but he was
aware of its full extent here he stood on the
cliff and gazed across to san francisco he was
young he was healthy and strong before him
could lie a long and happy life

  tomorrow perhaps he would be the most fam-
ous man on earth

  tomorrow perhaps millions would lie at his
feet

  not a good outlook one to a hundred prob-
ably tomorrow about noon his young limbs would
be torn to atoms flying across the ocean like a
new icarus-he who burned his wings on the
sun

  he started feeling that some-
one was standing behind him

  it was irene allister

  why have you done it

  he looked at her a thoughtful
expression in his eyes

  did you not tell me yourself
miss allister that you would only
love a man who did something
extraordinary

  she seized his hand

  then it is for me then i am
to blame if tomorrow you-
anxiety fear and deep feeling
were in her words yet egon took
it in a most remarkable fashion
certainly a few days before
when he was alone with irene in
her fathers park he had spoken
of his love and she had said with
a smile the words which he now
repeated

  but now all that seemed to him
so strange and trifling that night he had re-
solved that at the very first moment he would
place himself at apels disposal

  was it to win irene allister

  in these two days he had become quite an-
other person he had thought nothing more
of irene he was completely sunk and absorbed
in the immensity of his new work he felt
himself a pioneer in human knowledge and
achievement

  now the weeping girl stood before him could
he standing at the threshold of eternity think
of a girl  to be sure she was dear to him and
he was infinitely sorry for her

  no miss allister you are not to blame it
is my own free will to offer my life to science
and perhaps to the future of mankind

  she looked at him and slowly he looked away
again into the distance she had flirted with
him as with many others at this moment

when she fqflt that the soul of this man was
barely held to earth he seemed to her super-
naturally grand and splendid and she knew
that she loved him

 remain here

he turned again to her he softened he
laid his hand on her head saying be happy
and hope that your fathers work will succeed
at this moment his eye was fixed on some-
thing else he saw a swift little motorboat
speeding across the bay below he felt as
though he could suddenly see clearly

 excuse me please miss a lister

he freed his hand from hers and walked
quickly into the house

 she looked after him realizing that he had
 completely forgotten her for the first time
 since she was a child irene allister bowed her
 head on a post of the fence and wept

a sudden decision

 joe allister was standing alone in the little
 special room behind the great hall the hub-
 bub of the people who crowded about him had
 become too much for him and the old man felt
 exhausted

 egon helmsttter walked up to him may i
 trouble you for a moment

 at once the petroleum king took in the terri-
 fied expression of the young man

 what is it 

 i do not know mr allister but for several
 minutes i have felt an inexplicable anxiety
 allister smiled understanding

 it is of course for you to say whether you
 wish to ascend tomorrow

 egon shook his head

  nonsense wasnt it your intention to set
 out for new atlantis at the same time as the
 steamer

 certainly

 would it not be possible for us to start at
 once so that you might take me to the artificial
 island as fast as possible

but why

 i cannot tell you i myself do not know sud-
 denly the idea seized me that danger threatens
 the rocket this very night that we cannot get
 there soon enough

 you are nervously excited

 perhaps but-

 well has something happened to you

 i was standing by the cliff when all of a sud-
 den i saw a swift motorboat hurrying across the
 water toward the mouth of the bay

 and what else

 nothing else i only imagine that there might
 be people in the boat who would injure us who
 would go out on the ocean at night in a motor-
 boat

 perhaps a couple of over-eager reporters
 they cannot land new atlantis is well watched
 the old man walked back and forth nervously
 your anxiety is infecting me of course it is
 nonsense but after all- he laughed do you
 know that really is a good idea now is the time
 for the festive dinner speeches to me to you to
 everybody the usual mutual incense-burning

 without any sense look for my daughter and
 we will set out secretly order my car this is
 a fine joke while the hyenas of enthusiasm are
 waiting for us in the hall we will quietly make
 our getaway eat comfortably on my yacht and
 sleep a few extra hours before the big show be-
 gins

 when the committee of honor entered ten min-
 nutes later to accompany mr allister and egon
 helmstatter solemnly into the banquet hall they
 were disappointed to find nothing but a note
 we have already started for new atlantis
 they actually were already on board the
 swallow the white yacht of the petroleum king
 passing through the bay

 it was two hours later already they were far
 out in the ocean for the motorboat was making
 extraordinary speed thru the quiet sea kurt and
 the american for a long time had ceased to sit
 in hostile fashion on opposite sides of the boat
 they were sitting together below in the tiny cab-
 in where the spray did not enter korus had
 lighted a cigar and the american had filled his
 pipe

 we should be there in about an hour
 then we have at least four hours start on
 allisters yacht

 of course the island is guarded

 the american bent close to the german

 i absolutely have to get into the rocket to-
 night if i can telegraph the new york evening
 ledger an exact description of the ship early to-
 morrow i shall earn four thousand dollars
 we germans are poorer ill get only three
 thousand marks

 well we must get in but how

 korus held out his hand

 tit for tat

how so

 if you are ready to render services in return
 ill take you along

 have you confederates

 three makes an alliance

who is the third	

nagao hazumi

 the japanese

 yes from the asalii you know the tokyo sun
 they pay more than new york five thousand
 dollars

 is he there already

he has been for three days among the
guards disguised as a chinese

 ill be damned for three days

 no matter he doesnt understand technical
 matters he has to wait for me to come and ex-
 plain it all to him i shall do that so that he
 will take me into the rocket

 the american pressed his hand

 then we three america germany and japan
 will send our reports at the same time

new atlantis

the white yacht of the petroleum king was
speeding across the ocean under a full head of
steam to be sure it couldnt catch the little
motorboat with the speedy engines joe allister
felt very content
between earth and moon	

  pitch in doctor you will not be- offered such
good food tomorrow

  egon smiled a little

  i hope that the lunch in madagascar is not
too bad

 well you will be only a few minutes en
route

  egon was very serious

  perhaps a whole eternity

  allister shook his head

  dont forget that you have my million in your
hand

  irene could no longer bear to listen to this con-
versation silently she left the room

  still the motorboat raced through the waves
it was almost midnight pitch dark the moon and
stars veiled by black clouds but in the sky there
suddenly appeared a bright light growing
stronger every minute korus and the american
were now standing on the deck of the boat
new atlantis

  it was the little island in the vast ocean as
yet unseen by anyone carefully guarded from
every outside eye by joe allisters stately fleet

  it was a remarkable island circular about
half a kilometer in diameter it rose from the
sea floating on it and fastened to the bottom
only by strong anchors it actually was a huge
hemisphere of metal and concrete open under-
neath above it was shaped to a single perfectly
level platform which rose so high above the
water that it was not splashed by the waves
from this platform steps led down to the water
all around on all four sides ribs several hun-
dred meters long extended out into the sea form-
ing four harbors which could be used according
to the direction of the wind

  at the outermost point of each of these break-
waters was a little lighthouse and before each
of these lighthouses one of joe allisters ships
lay at anchor with steam up

  the little motorboat had put out all its lights
and the motor was throttled to a very low speed
korus looked at his watch

  ten minutes of twelve we must wait these
ten minutes i told nagao hazumi that i would
come at midnight we cannot venture the en-
trance without him to guide us

  full speed astern

  the american had pulled the lever himself
the nearest ship was sending out a searchlight
and sweeping the ocean

  the devil we came near being in the beam of
light

 they remained motionless rocked by the
waves while the american laughed

  i feel as though i were aboard a rum runner
  they looked at the watch

  midnight-five past-ten past twelve

  they listened everything remained unchanged
yonder was the brilliantly lighted island in
the middle of which a great structure of iron
beams rose indistinctly yonder were the four
ships each in turn sweeping the sea with its
searchlights

  the japanese is not making any sign

 who knows what may have happened to
him

 every minute is precious we must chance
 it

 absolutely impossible

 why

 we can in no way land without being noticed
 certainly there are guards on the shore too
 are we to turn back

 well swim over

 without replying korus jumped down into
 the cabin came up with the remains of the ham
 which they had been eating and threw it into the
 water at once great fish heads shot up from the
 depths

 there are also sharks

 the two men who were watching with vex-
 ation the sharks fighting over the booty could
 not help shuddering at the sight then they were
 addressed in broken english

 good evening sirs

 they looked around it was not as they had
 first thought the chinese sailor but instead a
 small japanese in european clothing

 nagao hazumi are you here

 yes you went right by my boat how could
 you be so careless if the ships see you we are
 done

 well then

 i am here in a rowboat it was not easy to
 reach your boat

 can we land

 why else should i be here

 have you been in the rocket yet

 things will be ready in an hour

 what does ready mean

 when the guards are asleep

 brandy

 the japanese first cast a questioning glance
 at the american was reassured by the german
 and then whispered in their ears opium
 fine

 the japanese took charge all three got into
 the little rowboat in which nagao hazumi had
 come and which he had tied to the larger boat

 the chinese was ordered to return to san
 francisco but in any case to make a wide detour
 in case allisters yacht or the steamer with the
 guests of honor should encounter him nagao
 hazumi rowed on then waiting until the beam
 jof the searchlight of the nearest ship had
 again disappeared he whisked past the steamer
 with almost noiseless strokes and slipped into
 the shadow of the breakwater covered by this
 they approached the strange island of new at-
 lantis

 chapter if

the mysterious projectile

 as silently as he had rowed along the break-
 water the japanese made the boat fast at
 the grated edge of the lowest step of this re-
 markable island he got out first and looked
 around already during the trip korus had made
 him acquainted with the american though the
 japanese had certainly given him no friendly
 looks

 it was against the agreement

 korus shrugged his shoulders
	wonder stories quarterly

  was i to get myself knocked into the water
said he turning to a right in fact that talk
about swimming the channel was all bluff

  the latter smiled and said so was knocking
you into the water

  peace was established and now the pair wait-
ed until nagao hazumi beckoned to them

  the miserable swine are already fast asleep
there is no danger

  to be sure one pigtailed gentleman staggered
past them as all three stood on the top step
but his eyes were already half glazed and the
longing for opium had complete possession of
him

  first a look into the barracks

  the devil the yellow race isnt so bad on
the contrary i am afraid they will give us all
a nut to crack but when opium has them in its
claws-

  they now approached the central elevation
what they now saw was a phantastically un-
canny structure four towers something like
those of a radio station four slim towers of
ironwork with the immense projectile in their
centre only now did they see how immense it
was

  of course nodded korus a regular four
story dwelling house is at most seventeen meters
high this projectile as apel explained is
thirty-five meters long and six wide it is up-
right with the tip toward the sky see the
rocket is very loosely held by four elastic rings
running from the four towers at its four sides
are wheels which will also slip along elastic
tracks when the thing goes up below the
wheels which are probably cast off during the
flight are the gyroscopic controls of which apel
spoke and below that is at the rear end of the
rocket are the exhausts that is to say it is
really the auxiliary rocket which is fitted over
the actual stern like an overshoe there are the
knives with which one can cut off this auxiliary
rocket

  would you like to go with the thing nagao
he turned to the jap

  buddha forbid

  all right

  the american was fond of making a pun of
his name they now saw a sort of stairway in
one of the towers

  probably that leads to the cabin

  just say to the coffin for whoever is the first
to shut himself up in this cabin and begin the
flight is ready for burial

  but apel-

  is right in theory but in practise it is nothing
but a mad dream i am sorry for the man who
is sacrificing himself

  he firmly believes in it

  i certainly dont how about it colleague
korus we dont go along with him do we
we two certainly do not sir all right but
we must now take a good look around and earn
our pay

  they had climbed up about twenty-five meters
and were now standing on a little platform which
was full of holes from here they could get a
perfect view of the whole little concrete island

which had nothing on it besides the rocket struc-
ture but two barracks they also had a view
far out over the sea

  hello do you see out there

  good heavens lights out on the sea

  all right took out his spyglass

  damn it that is no chance steamer that
is allisters yacht

  then let us be quick

  they went to the door of the rocket which
was not locked it could not be because there
was no possibility of having anything like a
keyhole in the outer wall the lock was inside
only and now there was even a metal strip
wedged in between to keep it open

  the whole ship is pure beryllium

  they entered and korus took out his flash-
light

  we had better not light up who knows how
far it might be visible we would get the guard
ship after us

  the cabin was small about five meters wide
and two meters deep it took in almost the en-
tire width of the rocket right behind the bow
at the back was a bench very softly padded and
mounted on strong springs capable of holding
three or four people comfortably the entire
forward wall was covered with levers with all
sorts of mysterious switches bearing inscriptions
otherwise this wall was also padded and each of
the levers was in a depression over which a
little cushion was now bent back and secured
by a leather loop

playing with fire

e was clear that all these cushions were to
over the depressions before the start when all
four walls of the cabin would be completely
covered with padding likewise the ceiling

  damn it the pilot must get a good shaking
up in the cabin if such padding is needed
again the american shook his head

  i am not going along

  the japanese had opened a cupboard by turn-
ing a knob over at the side

  well the food supplies are not so bad just
look here

   it is a pity that no one will have a chance to
enjoy them

  the three journalists now were sitting on
the padded bench the american had placed
his flashlight on one of the shelves drawn out
of the wall and all were busy in writing notes
with hasty fingers korus even attempted to
take a flashlight picture with his pocket kodak
occasionally they looked out carefully the
steamer which they took to be joe allisters
yacht was rapidly coming nearer being already
close to the guard ships

  all right closed his notebook saying i will
bet ten thousand dollars that whoever carries
out the crazy idea of exposing himself in this
thin-walled ship to the pressure of the rocket
force will be smashed to bits right in the first
moment do you hear squashed flat torn to
atoms annihilated i will bet ten thousand
dollars do you understand
between earth and moon	

 no one seemed to want to tale the bet the
 japanese eyed the food in the cupboards

  it really is a pity i am sure that not one of
  the three of us has had a bite to eat tonight
  the good food will needlessly perish-

 he looked cunningly at the other two but
 korus shook his head

  a real journalist would set the world on his
  head like atlas to discover what he could learn
  but he would not steal

 all right said the american with a nod
 looking threateningly at the japanese

   the latter was already again among the levers

 if we only knew-if we at least could see
 somfe of the apparatus in action-

 lookout

 korus pushed back his hand

  but the levers here are simply for steering
  i never saw the working of such a gyroscope
  before the other two could prevent it nagao
  hazumi had turned one of the levers for a
  moment everything was quiet but then there
  came from behind or rather from below from
  the rear of the rocket a humming sound as
  though a clockwork were set in motion

  turn the lever back

 let us wait-

 the humming became stronger the structure
 of the rocket was already beginning to tremble
 a little

 for heavens sake push back the lever
 at this moment the american knocked the
 flashlight off the shelf the little bulb smashed
 on striking the metal floor and it became dark
 while the humming and the vibration increased
 a match

 they searched their pockets

  i havent any

 here

 the match flared up

 now i dont know which lever  turned

 his hand felt from handle to handle other
 sounds became audible outside at the break-
 water a whistle sounded evidently the yacht
 had reached the island

  lets get away

 those must be levers that dont matter the
 doctor will arrive any minute and shut every-
 thing off

 where are my notes

 the three intruders were groping about in
 the dark for the japanese had dropped the
 match because the rocket stood upright the
 bench was with the back downward and they
 fell over it because the shelf which swung
 in all directions was hard to push back into the
 wall in the darkness time was lost at the same
 time the sounds became louder every second
 there was a very gentle explosion at which the
 japanese tore open the door and leaped out in
 so doing he collided with someone outside

allisters feelings

 at the lick observatory the great california
 observatory on the southern peak of mt
 hamilton thirteen miles east of san jose built
 by the generosity of lick the manufacturer of or-
 gans and pianos in the year  was still lo-

  cated the second largest refractor in the world
  it was surpassed only by that of the chicago ob-
  servatory in the night about which we have been
  speaking there was great activity there

  director campbell himself was in the obser-
vation room

  when is the space rocket to ascend

  tomorrow forenoon

  have you found the mysterious island of
new atlantis

  not yet its place is kept secret and will be
disclosed only tomorrow

  ridiculous secrecy here i will look for it
myself

  he turned the dome seated himself in the ob-
servation chair and pointed one of the best tele-
scopes out to sea

  he sat there for nearly an hour then he shook
his head

  the air is not clear there is nothing to be
found

  at this moment he looked again into the eye-
piece to turn it back again when he cried soft-
ly-began to tremble and fell off the chair

 what has happened

  i dont know-i think it was the space rock-
et

  he was so startled that he could not talk
he jumped up ran to the great refractor and
gazed silently and tensely into the blackness of
the cloudy night

  it was only toward morning that the director
weary and vexed left his seat without saying
a word to his assistant and went back to his
dwelling

  the white yacht had traversed half the dis-
tance between san francisco and the artificial
island egon helmstatter was in the cabin he
was very serious some inner voice was telling
him that he would make the ascent either im-
mediately or never he was thinking about the
rocket what if something were happening
what if something were happening now to pre-
vent the flight he shook his head he did not
wish that he wanted to make the flight

  he knelt down and opened his suitcase he be-
gan to pack a knapsack he had brought with
all sorts of things which waldemar apel had not
given him until to-day he had intended to have
them carried to the rocket the next day but now
he filled the knapsack and buckled it then he
went up on deck and took his place forward
scanning the sea with his telescopes there was
nothing to be seen of the little motorboat on
the contrary ahead was a yellowish glow the
lighthouses of new atlantis

  irene allister was in her fathers cabin joe
allister was sitting in a chair and reading the
newspaper calmly reading the stock market re-
ports unaware of any danger

  father

  what is it

  does the rocket have to start tomorrow
  of course

  cant you postpone it a week

 why
wonder storie quarterly

 because i should like to go along too
 you are foolish-or are you in love with the
 doctor

 i should like to go along i should not care
 to have him get all the glory i am your daugh-
 ter

 just because you are my only child you may
 not risk your life if the first flight is success-
 ful-

 she pouted and said then the chance for a
 record is over-father-i should like to go too
 allister slowly rose and stepped over to her
 it enough for me to sacrifice the million
 not you too

 she gave a little cry

 what do you mean dont you still believg
 that it will be successful

 not since this evening

 for heavens sake why

 i do not know myself but i feel so and my
 feeling never deceives me

 and still you are letting him go

 standing forward looking out into the night
 doctor

 he turned and gazed at her in this hour he
 had not been thinking of irene

 have you faith in your work

 firm faith if scoundrels are not now taking
 a hand

 father no longer believes in it

 if he does not start if i admit that it is im-
 possible then i am the one who ridiculous if
 it does not succeed the german bears the blame
 what a terrible thing to say

anxious moments

 allister shrugged his shoulders and buried
 himself again in his newspaper irene went
 out and climbed up on deck egon was still

                                     illustration by paul
     it was a remarkable island it rose from the
     sea floating on it carefully guarded from
     every outside eye

that does not matter he has given the
money the rest is our affair waldemar apels
and mine

he could not understand why she suddenly
fled away he did not know that she was cry-
ing again he gazed over at the lights which
were growing brighter and brighter

 swiftly the swallow approached new atlantis
 as soon as the bright lights of the yacht rose
 above the horizon the searchlight of the fore-
between earth and moon	

most guardship by the breakwater began to play still more worried look on his face with his
signals were exchanged and a boat set out from telescope he scanned the island

the steamer the captain had recognized the
swalloiv and came to report to joe allister
good morning captain is all well
everything in order sir no ships sighted and
nothing occurring on the island

  egon took a hand in the conversation

 didnt a small motorboat try to get into the
 harbor

 the captain laughed saying it tried all
 right but when it came into the range of our
 searchlight it turned and fled back to san fran-
 cisco

 joe allister nodded you see he said i
 know my captains what are the chinese doing
 on the island

 probably nothing at all

 egon looked questioningly at him

 chinese are keeping guard

 intentionally they know nothing of science
 and can reveal nothing

 allister was completely at ease and looked
 sideways at egon but the latter was far from
 reassured on the contrary he had an almost

doctor doctor i believe you are nervous
indeed i am i beg of you let us land

joe allister shrugged his shoulders and smiled
to himself he had his own ideas about all this

i understand i should be nervous myself
surely if i-

he stopped speaking because he saw irene
coming the yacht was entering one of the sec-
tional harbors it moored at the pier and egon
was the first to spring ashore

hey look here

no answer-nobody-no guard at the shore
there was only the great steel colossus which
held the upright rocket in its spidery arms as if
in a tender embrace rising up alone into the air
mr allister where is the guard

they are surely sleeping soundly they are
only chinese after all

hurriedly egon raced into the great barracks
which served the guards as a dwelling it was
meagerly lighted by a few electric bulbs at a
glance egon perceived what had happened here

in a long row the chinese lay on their benches
their faces distorted into hideous grins their eyes

illustration by paul

half open with a look of absolute entrancement

opium

he saw in their hands the long thin pipestems
and beside the benches the little lamps over
which their greedy fingers had rolled the opium
to little pellets unspeakable horror seized him
but likewise renewed anxiety for which he had
no explanations

allister and irene had remained on board the
yacht and had called to egon that they were
awaiting his return remaining on the luxurious
little ship was very much pleasanter than in the
second barracks which were far from comfort-
ably equipped

egon ran toward the rocket all of a sudden
his worry increased tremendously he could not
believe his eyes and yet he saw it plainly there
was light in the rocket a tiny wavering light
as though someone were moving a flashlight
around

now he stood on the summit leaped up the
stairs in the tower and was about to open the
door but at this instant it was flung open from
within out slid a man a small man apparent-
ly a japanese leaping from the room he fell on
egon and nearly carried him along with him

egon plunged forward into the little cabin
	wonder stories quarterly

but he saw nothing for at this moment the door
was hurled shut by a frightful force at the
same time there resounded about him a crashing
and roaring he was hurled by an irresistible
force against the padding of the cabin and lost
his senses

the end of new atlantis

irene was standing on the deck of the yacht
joe allister was just about to descend to the
cabin

  father

  she gave a piercing shriek allister was be-
side her he saw her terrified face and followed
the direction of her finger

  what is it

  there is a light in the rocket

  now they both saw egon rushing across the
open place saw the doors open and something
plunge out but at the same instant both of
them were hurled to the deck a brilliant flame
flared up there was a fearful crash of thunder
and the white yacht was raised up by a gigantic
wave which suddenly burst forth from the ocean

  irene lay on the deck gripping the iron railing
in deadly anxiety in frightful terror she felt
herself drenched by the monstrous wave as it
broke downward but she did not lose concious-
ness her staring eyes saw rays of fire burst out
from the bottom of the artificial island fantastic
and gigantic flashes followed by a dreadful
concussion explosions of elemental forces

  at the same time such a breaking and burst-
ing as though the world were being rent asunder
there came an icy blast of air she saw iron and
fragments of concrete flying about her like a
chaotic rain of the judgment day she saw
how the rocket vibrated how the iron structure
broke and splintered how the narrow projectile
shooting out at the rear immense flames now
left the ground with a hissing and roaring

  now there was only darkness where a few
seconds before the lights of new atlantis had
gleamed

  the glare of the great arc lights was gone
her senses were weakened from the poisonous
breath of the gases of the explosion her last
glance took in once more the form of the rocket
it looked red hot was surrounded by flames
and-she drifted into unconsciousness

  the little yacht bounded like a rubber ball on
the wild waves the deck the superstructure
being destroyed looked like a heap of ruins it
was covered with fragments of iron listed bad-
ly and almost flooded with water bleeding men
were rushing about sailors with eyes full of
horror men just escaped from seemingly certain
death

  joe allister was standing erect clutching some
chance support with his bleeding hands and
staring at the place where new atlantis had
vanished single great fragments able to float
were still attached to the mighty anchors hu-
man beings chinese who had been hurled out
barracks and all by the air pressure were
struggling in the waves some boats from the
guard ships were fishing them out

  irene came to her senses battered in every
limb loudly she cried what has happened
all new atlantis has been blown up the
rocket started but everything is destroyed
for the first time in his life joe allister felt
his teeth chattering and in trying to talk he
stammered

  egon

  irene stood up while one of the steamers now
approached and took in tow the yacht the sink-
ing of which was not perceived by these two
terrified persons men boarded it and took them
to the steamer

  allister paid no heed at first only when he
and irene were safely settled when the steamer
cut the towline and the swallow sank close by
them did he find speech again my million
irene could have struck him in this hour she
hated him she lay weeping on the deck mur-
muring egon-i loved him so

  from the chaos of the wildly raging waters
rose a human head two arms swimming auto-
matically swimming without actual volition
it was nagao hazumi the japanese who was
far out beyond the breakwater raising himself
above the water and gazing about near him
floated a great flat thing it was part of the
wooden barracks in which the chinese had slept
he pulled himself up and sat on this unstable
raft wiping the water from his face with his
hand and now for the first time actually coming
to himself the fact that he had been standing
up on the platform of the stairs had caused his
being simply blown away by the first fearful air
pressure of the explosion which hurled him
through the air like a ball and then plunged him
into the sea far out

  nagao hazumi was a sinewy little fellow with
a body steeled by all sorts of sports he felt
his limbs to see if they were broken he felt
the feeling of having been flayed but he was
uninjured merely scratched to bleeding by the
impact with the water perhaps also by frag-
ments which had brushed against him he look-
ed about and slowly began to comprehend the
rocket the towers the barracks with the
chinese-everything was gone dark and dead
was the remnant of the island and the sea
foamed up high with violence of a spring-tide

  in his eyes was a painful horror he he him-
self had caused the catastrophe he had caused
it by his frivolous playing with the levers
though he was not certain of the actual reason
he had murdered his colleagues wrecking the
work for which allister had squandered a mil-
lion

  about him were shrieks of terror and cries for
help the four guardships two of them them-
selves suffering from heavy damage were sweep-
ing the sea with their searchlights in their
beams he could see chinese swimming or rather
being tossed about on the waves

  he tore a plank from his raft and used it as
an oar tirelessly again and again imperilling
his own life he rescued the chinese wondered
if the wave had driven away the sharks and
between earth and moon	

pulled one body after another on to his unsteady
raft until someone hailed him

  hello who is there

  guards of new atlantis

  a boat came over belonging to the guardship

  take over the men-chinese from the bar-
racks

  the sailors who were surprised to see a
japanese were still more surprised that he had
disappeared again by the time they had brought
the chinese from the raft into the boat nagao
hazumi had been thinking things over if he
were found he would have to talk and he would
have to give himself away only now it became
clear to him that they would take him to court
and pin the responsibility on him he had spied
around and seen a little boat tossing keel-up-
permost on the waves once more he sprang into
the water swam to the boat clung to it and
managed to right it again he even found the
oars fixed in the oarlocks with swift strokes he
propelled the boat further out to sea cautious-
ly he stood up and looked around the waves
had become calm again and in the distance he
saw the lights of a steamer which was heading
toward the island relieved in mind he rowed
toward this

  after all he was to blame and he was not
how did the other two concern him he had
risked his life for his newspaper so had they
for theirs certainly he had not intended to
cause the accident

  nagao hazumi dropped his oars left the
guidance of the boat to the waves and rested

  the steamer came nearer nagao had formed
his plan and became still more content when an
hour later he recognized with his sharp eyes
which penetrated even the night the approaching
steamer

chapter iii

the three alone

egon awoke from his unconsciousness he was
totally unable to comprehend what had hap-
pened to him he was in an apparently narrow
and absolutely dark room

  he was not alone for about him were vague
sounds evidently caused by living beings

  helmstatter tried to collect his thoughts it
was not easy for he had a violent headache and
nausea he felt like a person still suffering from
the after effects of sea-sickness

  very slowly his thoughts became lucid and he
reviewed what had happened he had seen a
light in the rocket he had rushed up the stairs
he had leaped in the cabin-and that was all
he listened the walls trembled slightly the
rocket was in motion he felt a surging of limit-
less joy the rocket was in motion then the
start was made successfully made

  this start had happened quite suddenly
through some chance still inexplicable to him

  in the conviction that for the moment his life
was probably in no direct danger he became
calm he groped his way along the walls he
himself had installed every switch and lever
and he could find them even in the dark

  he pushed a button and an electric light was
turned on

  egon stood up and looked at two terrified
faces totally unknown to him which were gazing
up at him

  the expression of these faces these deathly
white persons who were crouching before him
dirty upset and at the same time embarrassed
had an almost comical effect on egons once more
confident feeling

  how did you get here

  excuse me my name is korus

  even now the reporter could not entirely
suppress his impertinent nature

  a german

  correspondent of the berlin press

  and the other gentleman

  all right correspondent of the new york
evening ledger

  gentlemen with what right did you enter
this cabin

  with none at all simply with the boldness
with which a diligent reporter risks anything
for his paper

  yes echoed right

  the frankness of the two pleased egon
  you nearly killed the three of us

  that was not our intention we three that
is we two and the japanese nagao hazumi
wanted only to get acquainted with the internal
equipment of the rocket chance must have
caused one of us to turn a lever at once a
clockwork began to hum we were terrified and
we knew no longer which lever we had turned
the japanese jumped out and you burst in
then in that very instant the end of the world
came for all of us

  god almighty

  egon had hardly heard the last few words
he had leaped to the velocity meter and cast a
glance at it then he opened a narrow door
above the padded bench at the back of the cabin
crept through and disappeared for a moment in
the rear rooms leaving the two reporters alone
korus slowly stood up

  my bones are most remarkably unbroken
  mine too

  the rocket has started

  it is too bad that the doctor arrived if not
we two alone would have-

  nonsense my dear fellow we should never
have arrived on earth again besides mr all
right may i ask you for ten thousand dollars
how so

  you bet this amount that the rocket would
explode at the start

  the american said with a grin i propose
that we wash up first we found the water
tank yonder in the cabinet

  they cleaned themselves and also the floor
observing how the water oozed away under the
latter

  it is remarkable how good the air is here
  everything is remarkable

  egon returned with a very serious face
gentlemen it would be absolutely useless
for me to reproach you further for your ir-
responsible conduct by which you have cost joe
	wonder stories quarterly

allister a million and ourselves most probably
our lives by the wrong use of the levers you set
in action at the same time both the auxiliary
rocket and the actual ship most extraordinary
explosions must have occurred and i suspect
that you have destroyed the island of new at-
lantis and unfortunately probably a large num-
ber of human lives as well

  we really did not-

  i already told you that is pointless to talk
about these things we have though certain-
ly very much against my wish become travelling
companions and now there is nothing to be done
but to keep a good comradeship we are now al-
ready en route the pressure tremendously in-
creased by the premature immense explosions-
a pressure sufficient to deprive us of our senses-
prevented me from managing the steering con-
trols at the right time it is impossible for us to
carry out our intention of landing in madagascar

  the american slowly turned around

  excuse me

  egon continued we have already left the
terrestrial atmosphere some time ago and are fly-
ing through empty space

  good heavens

an inevitable doom

korus had jumped up from the bench he
did not manage to stand on the floor but flew
headfirst against the padded ceiling of the cabin
rebounded from this like a rubber ball struck
his feet on the floor flew up again from this and
doubtlesss he would for some time have con-
tinued this sport which was very amusing for
the two onlookers if egon had not drawn him
down on the bench again with a very gentle
movement

  what was that asked korus

  well gentlemen you must already start to
accustom yourselves a bit to our changed mode
of life since we are floating in space the laws
of good mother earth no longer hold for us
gravity is entirely changed we have become
independent and for us the force of attraction
of the earth no longer counts we have only a
much slighter one which the centre of gravity
of our own rocket purposely placed under the
floor of this cabin exerts upon us you see we
need not necessarily float about helplessly in
our cabin but we must avoid all violent motions
look

  from his trousers-pocket he took a heavy
bunch of keys and let it fall from his hand it
did not fall quickly to the floor but floated down
very slowly somewhat like a thin leaf of a tree

  all right who was just as much excited as
korus but did not seem at all despairing said
then are we on the way to the moon

  egons face was set

  we have no more fuel by your foolishness
our entire supply of hydrogen and oxygen has
been prematurely destroyed except for a few
oxygen cylinders which we need for our diving
helmets i have no reason to conceal anything
from you we have absolutely no more chance
to return to the earth

  i thought you could steer the rocket at will
so i can now i can at once turn around so
that we shall reach the earth again in a very short
time

  all right nodded his head and said well do
it

  but i no longer have the possibility of braking
the descent by exploding the gas in the opposite
direction to the line of flight once we have again
reached the field of terrestrial gravity we shall of
course plunge downward with a velocity increas-
ing every second on striking the earth we shall
obviously be smashed to atoms

  the devil

  i have therefore decided to go to the moon
  and then return

  i already told you that this is impossible we
are men and there is no use in deceiving ourselves
there is no return for us we can only try to
use the hours which fate still allots us to increase
our own knowledge

  korus shrugged his shoulders

  my own knowledge is actually of very little
use to me if i can not report it to my newspaper
egon replied seriously each of us will record
his observations exactly we will act like a physi-
cian who knows that he must die and yet records
up to the last moment his sensations and his study
of his own body hoping to help humanity thereby
each evening we will together draw up a record
and each time enclose it in a watertight beryllium
case if we are destroyed perhaps some chance
might carry some of these capsules back to the
earth and thereby benefit science

  korus jumped up again almost becoming a
rubber ball and pressed egons hand

  thank you doctor

  what for

  i thought to spend my life as a simple reporter
but now chance or rather your energy is giving
me a life-work

  the american also extended his hand taking
care however not to change his position and said
all right

  egon got up saying we cannot expend our
electric light foolishly

  he pressed a button on the right side of the
ship the beryllium plates externally attached
slipped away from the thick glass panes of the
windows at the same instant there poured in
such a flood of infinite dazzling light that they
shut their eyes while egon had to feel for another
button and darken the windows again now he
uncovered the windows on the left side of the rock-
et and after the eyes of the three men had adjust-
ed themselves again they saw a most extraordi-
nary sight

  about them was dense black space there was
no blue or cloudy sky such as they knew on earth
nothing but a deep black

  and out of this black there shone harsh cold
sharp in outline the stars back of them direct-
ly behind the earth could be seen as an immense
disk gleaming in the sunlight on which they could
readily distinguish the different continents
between earth and moon	

how it is done

orus shook his head

  how incredible it is we went up vertically
point on therefore the earth is below us but we
see it behind us yet we should have to stand with
our feet on the rear wall and be with our heads to-
ward the bow which is up for us

  no said egon we were in this position as
long as we were in the field of the earth i already
told you that for us now only the centre of gravity
of the rocket determines matters for us the des-
tination of our flight is always ahead and the
place which we have left this time accordingly
the earth is behind

  the rocket is a marvel

  it is only the practical application of scientific
knowledge which has long been known

  one more marvel which i must ask you to ex-
plain

  what is it please

  we are at present exposed to the frightful heat
of the suns rays which are beating down upon
our rocket unmoderated by any layer of air how
is it possible that we do not absolutely dry up and
that the metal of our rocket does not simply melt
egon smiled that is actually a secret of mr
apel he said now we have to endure not only
the extraordinary heat but also during the night
the chill of space with its  degrees centigrade
below zero the entire ship is not only painted
black but also covered with a substance which is
absolutely impermeable to heat and cold so that
here in our cabin independently of the outside
world we have at all times the temperature which
we produce for ourselves

  how is it on the moon asked the american
that i cannot tell you this is the first visit
there for me the smile which had played about
egons mouth at these words vanished again the
astronomers hold different views if horbiger is
correct in his certainly very ingenious theory of
congelation the moon is an absolutely frozen body
without any atmosphere having at all times the
pleasant temperature which i mentioned  de-
grees below zero

  korus who had already become an enthusiastic
science student said sorrowfully then even if
we arrive there and might be able to land getting
out of the rocket would be impossible in such cold
we would certainly freeze to death in a fraction of
a second

  that is not quite correct just because there
is no atmosphere there the cold cannot be trans-
mitted to us provided we wear over our skins a
suit of the same material impervious to heat as
the covering of the rocket so that we do not give
off our own bodily heat of course we must also
wear absolutely airtight diving helmets covered
with the same material and having oxygen cylin-
ders in them to make breathing there possible for
our lungs

  now the american had a question one last
point in this cabin there is at all times good air
therefore it is probably constantly renewed by
artificial addition of oxygen but now you say
that we have only a few more oxygen cylinders

then a time willl soon come when we shall very
simply suffocate

   not at present

  how so

  here we have followed further developments
of the plans and ideas of hermann oberth the
consumed air flows through a black tube filled with
potassium hydroxide which runs along the shady
side of the rocket in this all the impurities are
deposited only the purified oxygen and nitrogen
are conducted to the sunny side are warned again
there and return once more into the cabin as per-
fectly good air

   then it is an eternal cycle which is carried on
meanwhile korus had been looking intently out
of the window

  where are we actually

  that i can tell you with fair exactness apart
from the initial velocity caused by the explosion
which could not be recorded at all we travelled
during the first two hours as long as we still
had fuel at the rate of  kilometers an hour
since the fuel gave out our motion has become
constant at  kilometers an hour since we
have now been about six hours en route we have
gone about  kilometers 

  and how far is it to the moon

  the moon is about  kilometers from
the earth if we keep going at the rate of 
kilometers an hour we should need therefore
 hours for our trip or in round numbers five
days

  and for how long a time have we food and
drink

  it is accidental that we have any because
i expected to be only two hours en route if apel
nevertheless insisted on my taking along the
most varied sorts of supplies it was done to test
out which things were best suited in case it be-
came a question of longer flights later on it
was also because he wanted to have the rocket
make its ascent so to speak with full war load

a feast in space

while egon was busy examining his appara-
tus and making trials of the gyroscopic con-
trols which showed him that the rocket obeyed
every touch of his hand with extreme ease the
two young reporters set to work to go over the
supplies

  damn it joe allister knows the right sort of
things here are fifty cans of preserved meat
here are some vegetables here is stewed fruit
here is ship-biscuit-soda water-wine-coffee
-evaporated milk-tea-cocoa

  in truth it constantly happened that they for-
got about the lessened gravity picking up the
cans too quickly so that these floated around
like balloons

  the two young men became more and more
pleased since they saw that exactly the proper
temperature for them prevailed in the various
wall-cabinets in which they were kept

  the american put his hand on egons shoul-
der saying we have food for at least six weeks
and now i am hungry

   i too

	about  miles
wonder stories quarterly

 egon roused himself from his thoughts

 then we will eat

 korus gave a loud cry of joy as he opened a
 new cabinet

 here is a whole meal ready even a roast
 goose

 helmstatter stepped up lifted the goose and
 found under it a sheet of paper which he read
 and at once hid away there was nothing on it
 but the one name irene

illustration by paul

at last they saw the slender body of the rocket-
waiting for them-luminous in the earthshine

for an instant he had to collect himself in or-
der not to betray his emotions irene allister
had provided this meal for him he choked
down his emotion and said let us eat

he drew out of the wall the little shelf which
served as a table the american fetched dishes
and silver from the cupboard indeed every-
thing was of unbreakable metal korus brought
the roast goose white bread and the other deli-
cacies of course all had been packed in tightly
closed containers so placed between metal
spring-devices so that the pressure had not been
able to destroy them now they all began to eat
at first they had to accustom themselves to the
fact that whatever they took in hand seemed to
have become incredibly light the morsels flew
right into their mouths and when korus wanted
to carve the goose the heavy bird seemed to him
lighter than a postage stamp it was a good
thing for all of them that the ever recurring com-
ical events kept giving them cause for laughter

then korus opened one of the ten champagne
bottles which he had found among the supplies
between earth and moon	

likewise these bottles which were not made of
glass but of metal like all the rest of the vessels
had suffered no injury when korus now loos-
ened the wire to open the bottle the cork flew
with a quite extraordinary violence against the
ceiling while the champagne shot like a foun-
tain into the air

  of course the carbon dioxide has a much
stronger effect now too

  korus raised his glass saying heres to the
first trip to the moon

  the american drank the toast then he re-
filled his glass and said heres to the first three
travellers to the moon

  korus responded heres to the lucky chance
that brought us together

  egon had also emptied the first glass quickly
but now he merely sipped slowly he looked
at these two young men they could not be
much over twenty-five carefree youth appeared
in their eyes enthusiasm and boyish frivolity
had made them quite forget that they were
doomed to death he had heard of such young
men during the frightful world war back in
 who unconscious of danger obeying only
the feeling of ambition hastened with song and
laughter to meet the deadly bullet he could
not speak to them their gay spirit cut him to
the heart still he could not disturb their mood
he crept into the narrow room aft in the rocket
to investigate the apparatus to determine what
had been destroyed at the start and what was
still serviceable

  again a long time had passed egon found by
feeling about that he was lying full length in the
narrow room in which the hydrogen pumps were
installed he had been reflecting mentally he
had gone over what had probably happened
when the rocket was so suddenly torn from its
supports and hurled up into space of course
the barracks and the chinese were destroyed
it was a pity in the case of the poor devils being
victims to opium

  probably the island was split-his heart al-
most stopped close by the shore had been an-
chored joe allisters yacht

  the explosion must have cast up a most mons-
trous tidal wave surely the little yacht was
covered with fragments and sunk

  allister was dead-irene was dead

  there was a pain in his heart and yet a feel-
ing of calmness he himself had no one on
earth there was neither a mother nor brothers
and sisters to mourn the orphan by scholar-
ships and tutoring he had painfully secured his
education there was nobody dear to his heart
except irene allister and she was dead com-
pared to him there was no person on earth so fit to
sacrifice his life to science

  he returned to the cabin it was late at night
by earth standards exactly twelve-thirty the
first twenty-four hours of the trip were over
the measuring apparatus showed that they had
gone  kilometers korus and the ameri-
can were sitting at the table writing busily
what are you doing

  we are writing the reports for our news-
papers

  egon smiled sorrowfully and thought to him-
self reports that will never be read he seated
himself and on his part wrote briefly the days
observations then he took from one of the
cupboards a beryllium case which could be
sealed this container was actually intended for
containing small amounts of hydrogen

  are you finished gentlemen

  they both handed him their reports each
had carefully sealed his manuscript in an envel-
ope addressed to his newspaper

  egon smiled again he added his notes and
sealed the case which he put away in the cup-
board

  now we will sleep

  all three stretched out side by side on the
padded floor the light was extinguished and
soon egon heard his two frivolous young com-
anions breathing evenly in peaceful sleep he
imself lay with open eyes at ever constant
speed the rocket shot through the blackness of
space toward the moon under the hard and brill-
iant stars

chapter iv

meanwhile

the festive dinner in cliff house in san fran-
circo had ended more quickly than had been
expected the fact that two of the chief per-
sons the financier joe allister and the pilot
dr egon helmstatter had set out so hurriedly
before the great dinner made it a less notable
affair than had been planned it was peculiar
that after their departure a sort of unrest and
oppression prevailed in the assemblage after
the coffee was finally served-it was now about
eleven oclock in the evening-james barret the
owner of the new york ledger and president
of the american press association rose and
tapped his glass

  ladies and gentlemen he said  have a
proposal to make to you we are all too uneasy
to do any more dancing it would also be idle to
go to bed for two or three hours three hours
ago mr allister and dr helmstatter set out for
new atlantis let us not deceive ourselves we
all have an inner feeling that some special reason
caused this hasty departure here in this hall
are assembled all the guests of honor who are
to attend the start of the rocket tomorrow in new
atlantis down in the harbor the steamer is al-
ready prepared to leave the night is perfect
what do you say to our all going now to the
steamer and getting the captain to make the trip
tonight

  this proposal met with unanimous approval
in a certain measure it relieved their minds of
the feeling of uneasiness at once the automo-
biles started in a long line down to the harbor

  the ship had steam up and the captain of-
fered no objections with all the guests of
honor on board the ship left the harbor at full
steam half an hour before midnight even now
the uneasiness among the passengers did not
cease

  how long is the trip to new atlantis
	wonder stories quarterly

  the steamer is very fast the trip takes
about two hours but i am sure that we cannot
land until early tomorrow you may have a
good sleep

  nobody thought of going to bed each wanted
to be the first to perceive in the sky the lights
of the mysterious island of new atlantis hither-
to closed to the world after all they could
sleep in the harbor so the cabins were empty
and everyone crowded on deck five hundred
guests of honor were staring through telescopes
and field glasses into the darkness of night

  an hour had passed half the time of the trip
james barret had just looked at his watch and
noted that it was half past twelve

  suddenly a light flashed up straight ahead
followed at once by a mighty column of fire a
volcano suddenly erupting from the ocean spit-
ting a whole sea of flames toward the sky a
pillar of fire which spread out on all sides and
then-after a few minutes-entirely vanished

  nobody asked a question nobody spoke yet
everyone knew that new atjantis had blown up
with the rocket

  here and there were a few who timidly won-
dered whether it was only the start of the rocket

  nobody had seen anything of the rocket itself
in the fearful spectacle of the mass of flame
rushing skyward but after a few minutes the
roar of distant thunder came over the sea at
the same time the hitherto placid ocean was sud-
denly wildly stirred up and a monstrous tidal
wave topped with foam raised up the great
steamer tossed it about like a toy and pitched
the people on deck in a heap in another quar-
ter of an hour the sea was as calm and un-
troubled as before while the night sky was uni-
formly black everywhere the captain stood on
the bridge which he had closed to all outsiders
the ship was rushing on with all the power of
its engines

  new atlantis had exploded

  human lives in peril

  the radio operator sat in his room and listened
but no sos call came to his ear did they need
no help or was everything the island the chin-
ese the four guard ships and allisters yacht
completely destroyed

  finally the second hour passed there were
a few lights ahead-no great illumination of the
floating island but merely a few red and green
lights of ships apparently at anchor

  the searchlight began to work signals were
exchanged on the bridge the captain had the
loudspeaker connected to inform the guests of
honor

  a frightful catastrophe has occurred new
atlantis and the rocket have been destroyed
human lives are in peril i urgently request you
to remain quiet in dignified calmness in order
not to endanger the work of rescue

under arrest

silently the steamer glided up to the other
ships the certainty of a dreadful catastro-
phe oppressed everyone james barret was
sunk in reflection he alone knew that the rash

reporter all right had set out in the evening for
the island in the motorboat which barret had
purchased cheaply now his conscience smote
him was all right in some way responsible
for this frightful calamity had he done some-
thing rashly

  now it was bright on the ocean in the east
the first rays of the rising sun were beginning to
color the heavens the searchlights of the
steamer illuminated the dreary waste of wreck-
age which a few hours before had been the is-
land of new atlantis in the midst still floated
on the waves a mighty piece of concrete the
central part of the floating hemisphere on it
there rose up the gigantic remains of one of the
towers a twisted chaos of distorted pieces of
iron looking like an immense question-mark

  a boat stopped at the ladder of the steamer
a gentleman painfully climbed up guided by
sailors and behind him a lady they were joe
allister and his daughter

  respectfully everyone made room for them
without saying a word without even lifting his
eyes from the deck the pale man who had just
lost a million walked down the stairs to the cabin
irene walked behind her father equally silently
with a handkerchief pressed to her eyes so that
people could not tell whether she was weeping
or ashamed

  in another hour the steamer had turned and
set out again for frisco there was nothing
more to be done the survivors unharmed and
wounded were safely lodged aside from two
chinese there seemed to be no dead to bewail

  there was murmuring on board

  the rocket exploded

  probably criminals had a hand in the game
helmstatter must have suspected something
when he arrived he saw a light in the rocket
and wanted to interfere but it was too late he
was destroyed along with the rocket

  the swallow was sunk by the wreckage that
showered on it it is a miracle that allister and
his daughter were saved

  it was five in the morning they were already
halfway back to frisco some of the passengers
were now sitting on the deck some were gath-
ered in groups in the saloons all were talking
in muffled voices

  the captain was in the pilot house when the
radio operator who had got a relief entered

  what is it

  a japanese just put in this message to be
sent a radiogram to the newspaper tokyo asahi
in tokyo

  what of it why are you so disturbed

  i understand japanese allow me to read
you this telegram before i send it

  the captain hesitated

  disclosure of the contents of a communica-
tion

  captain i think you will at onde arrest the
japanese

  the captain and the radio operator came down
from the bridge the latter called a steward
between earth and moon	

                                                       

and the captain asked what do you know about
the japanese

  he had cabin  but apparently he was not
on board at all when we left frisco it was only
when we anchored at the scene of the catastrophe
that he suddenly came down stairs dripping with
water and had his cabin showed him to be
sure he asserted that he had jumped into the
water in an attempt to save a man but i am
convinced that he was not on board the ship at
all until he got on at new atlantis

  the captain knocked on the door of the cabin
it was some time before there was an answer and
the door was opened

  nagao hazumi who had occupied the cabin
and brought his luggage there was now wearing
a suit in perfect condition but he looked ex-
hausted and weary probably he had been ly-
ing asleep on the bed fully dressed

  who are you

  nagao hazumi correspondent of the tokyo
asahi here are my credentials as an invited re-
presentative of the press

  you were on board the ship when we left
frisco

  of course

  presumably i shall be obliged to arrest you
  i protest

  you seem to have caused the catastrophe at
new atlantis it is useless for you to deny it i
have read your report of your secret visit to the
rocket and your description of the calamity
then you have violated the secrecy of a com-
munication

  as captain i am justified in so doing i tell
you that you may already consider yourself under
arrest

  the japanese smiled

  i have committed no crime it is not my fault
that the explosion suddenly occurred do with
me what you will no one can take from me the
glory of being the only journalist in the world
who has seen the inside of the rocket and who
was present when it left

  you were alone

  you have absolutely no right to interrogate
me

  when james barret learned of the arrest of
the japanese he drew a breath of relief then
his reporter was not to blame

good news

the steamer was again in frisco the prom-
inent persons were assembled in the great
reception hall of the allister house dispatches
kept coming in the first being from the lick
observatory

  tonight twelve thirty in ocean about hundred
miles west of frisco supposed location of island
new atlantis saw ascent of rocket with vigorous
production of flames rocket shot like light-
ning straight up leaving field of vision after few
seconds made vain attempts to see it later in-
side atmosphere and in space

  allister stared at the telegram

  then the rocket did not explode
waldemar apel said quickly the beryllium
covering was of almost indestructible hardness

  besides the force ot the explosion was directed
 mostly downward and the thin supports of the
 rocket offered no serious resistance to its depart-
 ure

   now irene stepped up

   then there is hope

   at least the certainty that the rocket started
   and will it return

   that is in the hand of fate

   how long a time has passed

   six hours since the start

   in this time it must have gone around the
 earth presumably several times at least

   a radio message was sent to madagascar re-
 ceiving an immediate reply nothing seen of
 rocket here

   radiograms came from all the ships at that
 time on the ocean between america and asia
 many had noticed nothing at all a number had
 seen a flash neither any ship nor any of the
 observatories had seen anything of the descent
 of the rocket but some did indeed confirm the
 report of the lick observatory as to the ascent

   a whole squadron of airplanes flew from
america and a simultaneous one from japan
which examined the ocean

   the rocket had ascended withstanding the
 first shock and it was actually improbable that
 it would explode in the air if it descended on
 the ocean it could easily float being much too
 light to sink on land the wreckage would be
 visible all the world was extremely excited
 no one could guess where the rocket had de-
 scended and still no news came

   finally toward evening came a radiogram
 from a japanese steamer something had been
 fished out of the sea a crushed and battered ob-
 ject but quite certainly a part of the rocket

   at once waldemar apel took a plane to visit
 in person the japanese steamer which had
 headed for hawaii he returned during the
 night bringing a monstrous but evidently very
 light bundle

   of course everyone was still assembled in the
 allister house they marvelled at the contented
 face shown by the returning apel

   do the fragments come from the rocket
 yes and no it is the auxiliary rocket which
 was to be and had to be cast off at a certain
 height in any event it proved perfectly ser-
 viceable thus far the flight therefore seems to
 have been successful

   there was breathless excitement while apel
 was talking with allister the rest all whispered
 together

   the flight was successful but where is the
 rocket

   some cynic laughed remarking the opera-
 tion was successful but unfortunately the patient
 died

   the japanese nagao hazumi was interrogated
 before the court

   i am no criminal and i have nothing to con-
 ceal said he but recognizing that suspicion
 for the actual starting of the rocket might rest on
 him and that some one of the three presumably
 had accidentally turned some of the levers he
wonder stories quarterly

admitted that the german kurt korus and the
american all right had been with him

  since the tokyo newspaper at once took his
part and posted security for his appearance if
wanted he was again released and hurried with
the judge to the allister house

  if

  a short consultation was held after which
waldemar apel mounted a table in the centre
of the room

speech speech tell us all about it
ladies and gentlemen there is no doubt that
the start of the rocket was successful and that
thereby the first part of our task has been ac-
complished

  agreement laughter contradiction

  the first part of our problem is solved the
construction of the rocket has proved excellent
the fact that the auxiliary rocket was cast off
according to plan proves this we are in no way
responsible for the fact that the hands of-i
must admit not malicious but frivolous-young
people caused the start very prematurely on
the contrary the very fact that the rocket was
not destroyed under these conditions is a proof
of its efficiency

irene learns the truth

interruptions but where is it now  
apels voice had become very serious and
solemn it is as good as certain that it has not

illustration by paul

instantly there was an explosion egon and the
american were hurled through the door

returned to the earth probably the excessive
shock of this unpremeditated start stunned the
three occupants from the admission of mr
nagao hazumi we now know that besides the
pilot also the german reporter kurt korus and
the american all right have taken the trip
though very much against their will this prob-
ably prevented them from managing the controls
at the right time perhaps they only got control
of the rocket after it had left the vicinity of the
earth and decided to risk a flight into space
to the moon

  yes perhaps to the moon

  more interruptions or else and this is the
right idea the three luckless fellows were in-
stantly killed and the rocket has become a fly-
ing coffin

  that is also possible but in this case the
blame rests on the two reporters alone

  he jumped down from the table and there
was a storm of voices excitedly they argued
pro and con news poured out into the city
loudspeakers had received apels speech and
between earth and moon	

were roaring it out in streets and public squares
in the theatre

  radio waves took it across the sea in the en-
tire world starting from frisco in europe afri-
ca australia everywhere at the same hour
thousands and millions of people were listening
to the words of waldemar apel

  human beings have flown into space the
first travellers to the moon

  the space rocket is en route

  the next morning the newspapers of the world
all gave monstrous pictures of the three travellers
through space

  nagao hazumi was wild with rage that he
had not gone too what was his report about
the rocket now compared with the fame of his
two colleagues bets were made as to the life
or death of the bold travellers the newspapers
were filled with the speculations of all the
learned men on earth

  constantly squadrons of planes went out to
sea the wild mountainous lands in asia were
examined an international agreement was
made that all commercial radio communication
was to cease at once and that every receiving
station was to tune in immediately if any news
at all arrived about the space rocket reports
poured in but proved to be mere fancy every
passing meteor was thought to be a rocket the
whole next day passed without any telescope
succeeding in seeing anything of the fliers and
without their descending

  the excitement became almost immeasurable
but the rooms of the allister house in frisco re-
mained closed and its dwellers refused to re-
ceive any visitors

  irene allister stepped into the room which
waldemar apel was occupying during his stay
in frisco and in which packed suitcases now
stood

  a word mr apel

  the old man was amazed at her determined
face

  do you believe that the men in the rocket are
still alive

  the old engineer looked into the girls face
and smiled understandingly she was asking
about the three but meant only one

  i hope so

  she became more insistent can they be
alive

  why not the rocket withstood the shock
and why should the cabin have suffered of
course i cannot know what has happened but i
have hopes

   then you think it also credible that they will
return

  if the steering apparatus has remained ef-
fective-

  she took his hand mr apel she said is
there no means no possibility to help them

  i do not know for now there would be only
the task of completing the second rocket which
is built except for the putting together of the
equipment then we could go to their aid in
case we should in some way recognize that they
needed help

 why isnt that being done

 perhaps your father has lost a million in the
 rocket the after-eearches have consumed a
 few hundred thousands he is not willing to
 give any more money

 how much is needed

 if i had a quarter of a million at my disposal
 to-day the second rocket could be ready to start
 the day after tomorrow

 where is it

 at my private observatory on mt atkinson on
 the edge of the rockies i built it there to make
 the experiment of starting from a mountain with
 the second rocket

 has father refused the money

 yes

 and is this why you are leaving

 yes

 is this second rocket the only means of help-
 ing the first one

 of course

 who should ascend in it

 i myself

 for a moment irene looked seriously at apel
 then she came to a decision

 please wait a few seconds for me

irene decides

 apel walked angrily up and down in the
 room he knew joe allister once this
 man had said no nothing could change his mind

 irene returned and handed him a piece of
 paper

 what is that

 a check for two hundred and fifty thousand
 dollars

 apels face lit up did your father actually
 do it he asked

 no he flatly refused this is my inheritance
 from my dead mother it is certainly air that i
 have but i am of age and can dispose of my
 money

 and you want to do this

 i regard it as my duty to save my fathers
 honor joe allister cannot do things by halves
 again apel gazed searchingly into her eyes
 and an involuntary blush came to her cheeks
 there is however one condition

 what is that

 when you ascend take me along

 that is impossible

 you said before that it was impossible for you
 to get the money the money and i go together
 either both or neither

 you underestimate what this means

 i underestimate nothing at all i have or-
 dered my car which will be ready in half an
 hour at any rate i have to give up saying fare-
 well to my father because he would prevent my
 going i am going with you by the fastest route
 to mt atkinson you will at once order by tele-
 graph everything necessary to fit out the second
 rocket you will instruct me in everything nec-
 essary for being your assistant you know that i
 have studied mathematics and science i will
 not be a troublesome pupil

 apel still hesitated i dare not on account
 of your father
	wonder stories quarterly

  do you dare to abandon your pupil who has
offered his life for your undertaking

  apel put the check in his pocket well be
it as you wish he said

  then he stepped over to her one serious
word miss allister he said you know i am
old enough to be your father is it just an over-
whelming love

  she became embarrassed but she shook her
head

  i do not know whether i love him-love him
so-

  then her eyes began to shine

  but i do know that i envy him from the bot-
tom of my heart that i should like to be at his
side that my heart is full of enthusiasm i be-
lieve in the rocket let me have my wish

  she released her hand from his and stood in
the doorway

  i shall see you in half an hour

  apel gazed after her and straightened up he
himself had almost lost courage but the confi-
dence in these two girlish eyes so full of life
gave him back his strength and vigor

chapter v

the moon at last

another day and a half of the flight had
passed during the last twenty-four hours
egon had hardly left the steering controls the
three men were in the greatest excitement for
the yellow ever brighter disk of the moon was
becoming larger and larger

  on the evening of the fourth day-the fourth
terrestrial day that is-the moon suddenly be-
came totally different losing its yellowish light
it looked monstrous and brilliantly white like a
vast field of ice out of which there rose a count-
less number of round craters some of them very
wide

  at the same time they perceived that their
speed was becoming more rapid the velocity
meter mounting higher and higher likewise
they suddenly saw that the rocket was turning
they were no longer approaching bow on but
were falling stern first this being the part where
the centre of gravity was

the three travellers to the moon felt as though
the rocket had not turned but had stopped for a
moment wavered and were then sinking down
all right and korus stood together in terror
now we are lost after all

  of course we shall get smashed on the moon
man cant you do anything to check the
fall

  havent you a parachute

  with a smile egon pointed to the velocity met-
er see said he we are floating down very
slowly the velocity we had in space is now
adapted to the slight force of attraction of the
moon anyway a parachute would be useless
because the moon has no atmosphere

  at this moment the velocity meter stood still
the journey was ended the doctor made the
metal shields of the windows which he had
closed open again the three men uttered a cry

of astonishment they were now floating per-
fectly still above the moon

  egon was very much moved

  gentlemen whether we return or not this
moment is a turning-point in the history of man-
kind it is a triumph of science and technology
man has conquered space

  shall we be able to land

  certainly if we dress ourselves properly and
take care to carry with us oxygen to breathe
they stood there unable to tear themselves
away from the sight

  let us hurry

  no let us be calm we will eat and rest
you know that for thirty hours i have not left
the controls we must not be too hasty

  what if something drives us away again
  of course we shall cast anchor

  for the first time the air-lock was opened
which had the form of the connection between
cars on a german express egon changed his
clothes put on his diving helmet and warning
the other two to stay back he stepped out he
cast out the heavy anchor while for the first time
his eyes took in fully the lunar landscape

  in this splendid moment he wished to be alone
the preparations for leaving the rocket were
finished the three pioneers of lunar investiga-
tion certainly looked most remarkable next to
their bodies and fitting very snugly like a second
skin they wore thin clothing of the material whose
composition was the secret of waldemar apel
this was to protect them from any loss of warmth
they were not acquainted with it and had not
yet tested its effect but they were given confidence
by the fact that they had suffered from neither
heat nor cold in the rocket which was covered
with the same substance

  nevertheless the next moment was another
leap in the dark a rash venture

  was the moon actually nothing but a frozen
lump of ice did the deepest cold of space pre-
vail there if so their death would be certainly
instantaneous if the material did not prove ef-
fective likewise if even the tiniest opening or hole
admitted the cold to their bodies over this rela-
tively thin garment each wore a leather suit
actually they would not have needed any other
clothing if the artificial skin was impenetrable
to cold any more clothing was superfluous still
they picked out the stout leather clothes which
waldemar apel had made for this purpose and
packed in the rocket not for warmth but to pro-
tect the artificial skin from any injuries and holes
on their feet they wore heavy boots shod with
thick lead plates that too was necessary
in order to bring their centres of gravity down to
their feet lastly they fastened on their heads the
large diving helmets which apel had made these
also were completely lined with the substance
impermeable to heat it was done in such a way
that this material which they called the artificial
skin fitted around the neck very snugly to the
natural skin just this point was very dangerous
because otherwise the unprotected face would be
struck by the cold

  it had taken apels chemists weeks to produce
from this substance a transparent solution with
between earth and moon	

which they could coat the eye-pieces of the helmet
on the inside and make them also safe from the
cold these eye-pieces were cut from the finest
crystal and were colored like snow-glasses

  of course the mouth was also cut off from the
outer world opposite it to enable communica-
tion a telephone diaphragm was set in

  that an oxygen cylinder and an apparatus for
making possible free breathing were included is
obvious

egon descends

the three men who now had more semblance
in looks to prehistoric monsters were all
ready the american carried on his back an ax
and a bag of tools korus had a similar equip-
ment egon carried on cords likewise covered by
the artificial skin thermometers telescope and
field glasses and surveying instruments as well
as various other scientific apparatus moreover
each held an alpenstock in his hand they did
not take along any food or drink these would
have been useless because they could not have
eaten or drunk anything without taking off their
diving helmets and therefore instantly freezing
to death

  egon stepped to the door which led to the air-
lock

  i shall step out first in case in spite of all
our precautions i should be instantly killed do
not bother about me but shut the door and think
of your own safety

  there was a remarkably strange sound to the
speaking and answering through the diaphragm
of the helmet moreover what egon said was
really foolish if they did not succeed in finding
on the moon by some lucky chance by some un-
suspected discovery a possibility of returning
then a sudden death was the best thing for them

  egon now stood in the air-lock and carefully
opened the outer door after having taken pains in
closing the door leading to the cabin it was
vitally necessary to use this air-lock with incred-
ible precaution so that as little as possible of the
air in the cabin should be lost

  at any rate egon had not felt the cold at all
he reflected for a moment bent down to grasp
the anchor rope and then stood with his feet in
the soft white moss of which the moon seemed to
be covered

  he saw that the heavy anchor who had been let
down had not taken any hold but was lying free
on the ground

  a frightful terror seized him and for some
seconds thoughts raced through his brain what
if a storm came now  how did he know whether
there were storms in the moon what if some
force drove the rocket away the possibility of
being all alone in this dreadful place the fright-
fulness of which came to him most overpowering-
ly filled him with horror	-

  at this moment he felt that the presence of the
two undesired companions was the greatest bene-
fit that fate had given him

  he wanted to go over to the anchor he took a
few steps looked about in surprise and perceived
that he was already far past it what a peculiar

way of walking it actually was not walking but
a sort of floating along as though on an immense
spring-mattress a combination of hopping and
floating

  every step took him infinitely further than it
would have on the earth as he tried to jump
over a assure with his alpenstock he shot high
into the air and landed twenty meters beyond
he smiled to himself it was necessary to learn
how to walk on the moon first he had to under-
stand using much less of his muscular strength
than on earth in proportion as was required by
the so much lessened force of attraction of the
moon

  at the same time the considerable weight of his
equipment caused him no trouble at all

  finally he landed beside the anchor after much
jumping back and forth and looked for a chance
to fasten it this was quite needless for when
he tried to lift the anchor he noticed that he could
not budge it because it had long since been frozen
fast to the ground

  egon now pulled at the rope and found it easy
to wrap it around the anchorstock which stood
upright in pulling the rocket down he worked it
into a depression so only the ends touched the
ground to avoid its freezing fast to the ground

  now he returned reentered the air-lock shut
the outer door and loudly called into the cabin
come quickly

  there was no answer he repeated the shout
but nothing stirred again he was frightened
had something happened during his absence he
opened the inner door there the two reporters
were standing right before it waiting for him
they had not heard a word and he thought he
had screamed

  then all three entered the air-lock the inner
door was very carefully closed and they quickly
stood on the moon and looked about

  the sight was full of horrible splendor at
their feet was not as egon had at first thought
soft moss but rime-frost and pretty ice forma-
tions a rough ground stretched out about them
dead and hard furrowed and traversed by rifts

  the sky was neither blue nor arched as on
earth flat and black it weighed down on the
moon everywhere in the sky were the stars ex-
tremely brilliant like sharp hard coldly lumin-
ous points the constellations were of course of
the same shape as when viewed from the earth
it was striking that they were seeing the stars by
day-the lunar day that is which is equal in
length to fifteen terrestrial days

a scene of madness

back of them stood the immeasurably bright
sun but they had no sensation of warmth
from it even right under its rays the ice did not
melt there was merely a very thin layer of mist
over the ground the suns disk itself appeared
of about the same size as it does to the inhabitants
of the earth

  compared with the almost incomprehensible
distance of about one hundred and fifty million
kilometers lying between the earth and the sun
the three hundred and sixty thousand kilometers
	wonder stories quarterly

which the visitors to the moon had traversed
seemed only a trifle on the other hand the
earth which now appeared to them as a moon
was shining brightly among the fixed stars with a
disk almost four times that of the sun

  the centre of this disk the ice field of the pole
shone immeasurably brightly just as the moun-
tains of the moon appear when viewed from the
earth somewhat like the face of a man thus even
the naked eye could recognize from the moon the
different parts of the earth

  for a moment egon tore himself away from the
mighty spectacle and cast a glance at his ther-
mometer it was a petroleum instrument which
could measure the degree of cold down to two hun-
dred below zero

  it did not work it was frozen

  the congelation theory was correct it was not
necessary to have a better instrument the chill
of space two hundred and seventy-three degrees
below zero was all about them he straightened
up to tell this news to his two companions he
was full of admiration for the artificial skin which
was able to protect them from this infinite cold
at this moment he saw a most remarkable sight

  korus and the american stood facing each other
apparently having a lively conversation they
made more and more violent motions with their
hands and arms such powerful gestures that they
leaped up from the surface of the moon they
seemed to be expressing despair and horror sud-
denly they began to run in great bounds to the
rocket

  the spectacle would have appeared grotesque
and comical if it had not been so terrible here in
this dreadful scene the two men in their evident
haste to reach the rocket jumped with their
sticks almost as high as a house floating down
again to the moon they did not understand what
was happening to them they would look around
and then jump back again

  egon could not help thinking that both of them
had suddenly lost their reason he ran after
them waving his arms and caught up with them
just as they finally had reached the air-lock and
were getting in pulling at the cabin door without
any regard to precaution in opening it

  he was right behind them and shut the inner
door now he heard the two men bellowing at
each other at the top of their lungs dont you
hear me for heavens sake dont you hear me

  but now when their voices resounded with such
a roar they became silent and stared at each
other

  gentlemen what is the matter

  egon could not understand and was disturbed
at the idea of having two lunatics there with him

  outside we were deaf-or dumb-or deaf and
dumb

  we tried to talk together we shouted as loud-
ly as we could but neither could hear anything

  then egon smiled though of course the other
two could not see the smile on account of his hel-
met

  we forgot one important thing but we have
also made a discovery already

  a discovery

  you two have just given a striking demonstra-
tion of the fact that there is no atmosphere at
all on the moon you have spoken but if there is
no air then there are also no waves to transmit
the speech vibrations so even the greatest noise
cannot be heard even if the whole moon blew
up it would occur perfectly silently

  well then

  gentlemen we must get accustomed not to be
frightened by anything the first hour of our
stay in the moon has already assured us of three
certainties the chill of congelation the absence
of any atmosphere and accordingly the impossi-
bility of the existence of any living thing on the
moon anything corresponding in the least to our
ideas of life-no person or animal or even plant
or primary cell it is a marvellous fact that we
three inhabitants of the earth are the only beings
on this dead heavenly body the one-time planet
luna let us go out to experience more

  the three men did not consider for a moment
that they themselves were doomed to death they
did not even think of looking for some possibility
of rescue they were completely absorbed in the
enthusiasm for their infinite field of investiga-
tion

  now indeed each of them carried with him a
little ivory tablet and a pencil for writing on it
again they became rash leaving the clumsy
leather gloves in the cabin and contenting them-
selves with the artificial skin which to be sure
was double thickness on the hands when they
needed to exchange their impressions they used
writing instead of speech which was unknown on
the moon

a hope for salvation

n

there was a new marvel on looking about
j- it seemed to them that their field of vision
was a very different and much more limited one
than on the earth korus shrugged his shoulders
shook his mishapen head clumsily and made use
of his alpenstock as a jumping stock in one
bound he mounted a mass of rock nearly as high
as a house at once the american followed with
egon right behind

  here too the limit of vision the horizon was
barely twelve kilometers in diameter egon un-
derstood the questioning gestures of the other
two

  of course he wrote on his tablet the moon
is so much smaller than the earth that the spher-
ical or nearly spherical shape that it possesses
is much more evident that is why the field of
vision is so much more limited

  they looked about them they had landed in
the northern part of the moon the exact place
they could not determine because they did not
have nautical instruments and anyway would
hardly have understood how to use them if they
had had such things

  not far from them perhaps sixty-five kilo-
meters a very high mountain appeared to be
located egon was able to recognize this on the
lunar map which he carried hung on a cord they
also noticed that to the west of their position on
the block of ice it was considerably darker that
between earth and moon



                                                                                     illustration by paul

he went through a mighty room in which tremendous machines revolved
their wheels and raised their iron arms
	wonder stories quarterly

there were deep shadows there and a strange
bluish and reddish shimmer to the edge of the
ice

  while egon now took his telescope and ob-
served the earth making comparisons with his
watch as the hours passed he found out that the
seas and lands of the earth plainly recognizable
through the telescope could have served him in
lieu of a clock as they slowly changed their posi-
tion this would be well in case his watch ceas-
ed to work but it was of such perfect manufac-
ture that it required no oiling which was well
since it would have been stopped at once by the
freezing of the oil

  he looked about and again a sorrowful smile
came to his lips concealed in the helmet what
harmless frivolous children his comrades were
the two young reporters had again jumped down
from the rock or rather from the gigantic block
of ice a spirit of sport had awakened in them
they were amusing themselves by throwing little
pieces of ice into the air when they saw the bits
of ice rise up for two hundred meters or more
they would bound around for joy like rubber balls
the pieces of ice flew almost out of sight and then
slowly floated down again like tufts of cotton

  in mighty leaps they were playfully engaged
in surpassing by vast margins the best jumping
records on earth egon interrupted their certain-
ly very interesting games by writing on his tablet
now we must go back to the rocket and eat

  he had more serious things in mind than hunger
and thirst but he knew that these two human
requirements would be most enlightening to the
first lunar sportsmen

  again they entered the cabin carefully shut the
air-lock and took off their helmets the artificial
skin had done its work well and did not show the
least abrasion

  now they perceived that the exertion of their
limbs had made them really very hungry after
they ate egon commenced the conversation

  an idea has come to me which may perhaps
prove our salvation our only hope is to get hydro-
gen and oxygen to refill our apparatus with the
necessary mixture of gases as you saw i brought
some snow along and i have melted it on our
electric stove it became water but unfortunate-
ly we have no equipment here for decomposing
the water into its chemical constituents still i
do not think it impossible that we might find at
least one of these two substances alone in the form
of snow there is an opinion that in the depths
of the so-called lunar craters there sometimes
occurs if not an atmosphere still some hydrogen
mist at certain times we must look for this
that is why i am in favor of sleeping now and
undertaking a long trip tomorrow look at the
map of the moon about sixty-five kilometers
from here lies a high mountain it is pico who
belongs to the so-called plato system and is about
a thousand meters high i was pleased to see by
your sport how quickly we can get along by great
jumps i am sure that in a few hours we can
reach the mountain

  the american raised his head but tomor-
row he said we shall be in darkness the moon

rotates and so tomorrow we shall be on the side
turned away from the earth

  egon laughed you are right and wrong
said he my wish is to get to this part of the
moon which is turned away from the earth for
i hope that we shall find there what we need if
you had had more to do with astronomical mat-
ters you would know that in spite of its rotation
the moon always keeps the same side turned to-
ward the earth and that the other side is a mystery
forever hidden from us dwellers on earth other-
wise the so-called face of the moon would not
always remain the same therefore it is my in-
tention first to climb the mountain and then to
see whether it is possible for us to get a look into
the part of the moon turned away from the earth
we will sleep now and start out early tomorrow
certainly it will be necessary to eat and drink as
much as possible tomorrow morning for en route
we can under no circumstances eat anything at
all for that reason we shall perhaps be forced to
go without food for twenty-four hours or more

two days left

oth of them smiled depreciatingly

is that all there is to it

  korus put on a sorrowful expression and said
i am bitterly disappointed

  why

  because we are destroying a great hope for
the world the moon is dead there are neither
men nor animals in the moon we have accom-
plished something incredible and it is useless
why visit the moon why spend many millions to
travel through space to prove that the moon is
a perfectly useless body

  not entirely so it would be wonderful to
construct an observatory on the moon and be able
to study the stars and their conditions without
being hindered by our atmosphere think how
it would be if our plans should succeed an
observatory on the moon a building of the same
material as our rocket covered with the artificial
skin with oxygen and nitrogen for breathing per-
haps obtained from the lunar snow so that there
would be a good atmosphere in this building
which we could construct as large as we liked
think of a number of persons in this building
constantly connected with the earth by rockets
astronomers investigating space perhaps prov-
ing the fact that other planets can be inhabited
the moon as a sort of halfway port let us say
for terrestrial travel into the immensity of space
-the moon as the terminal of terrestrial local
traffic from which the great perfected space ships
will set out for other planets

  consider further from this secure house as
a starting point or base mining engineers could
penetrate the depths of the moon under the
covering of ice the thickness of which we cannot
determine there is a solid nucleus who knows
what it consists of it may contain precious
metals or even metals which are still totally un-
known to us and which may direct industrial con-
ditions on the earth into entirely new channels
the very fact that here and in space gravity has
hardly any effect makes it possible to bring great

loads without trouble from the moon to the earth
consider all this consider the many possibilities
and see whether you think our journey useless i
the two became enthusiastic then we have
nothing to do but find the two gases

nothing but that yet unfortunately infinitely
much for if we cannot find the precious snow
then our plans are rendered vain and we are lost
there was a pause with all three sunk in
thought then the american spoke again

  i am not sure but this evening i feel duller
than usual it seems to me as though the air in
the cabin were getting worse

  egon nodded it is so he said of course
good air escapes into the air-lock every time we
open the door it is also possible that the fact
our rocket is standing still may affect the purify-
ing apparatus

  we will use an oxygen cylinder

  we cannot in all we still have seven such
cylinders each of us needs one each day there-
fore we have two days left to live on the moon and
one cylinder over

  for a moment the two were terrified but then
korus said with an effort to give conviction to
his words we must find the snow tomorrow
egon agreed we must find it

the american yawned and stretched out on the
floor all right then we will find it said he

  a little later the two reporters were lying side
by side and sleeping as cheerful as young people
can egon stood at the window from which the
metal shutters were slipped back and looked out
the moon this wide expanse covered with rime-
frost and slight mist that crept along the ground
this place of icy ground and eternal stillness of
motionless immeasurable nothingness was the
moon the great puzzle of mankind the melan-
choly friend of the dwellers on earth in reality
their greatest enemy the moon the cause of the
ebb and flow of the tides the moon which had
been slowly coming closer and closer to the earth
until finally the day should come when it would
shatter into a storm of ice and a hail of rock
bursting upon the earth and causing a new deluge
perhaps a new destruction of mankind

  and he egon was a human being a living
breathing young man whom rashness of mind
had brought here and who unless a miracle oc-
curred had only forty-eight hours more to live

ghost shapes on the moon

many preparations were necessary for the
great trip on the moon after they had in-
tentionally had a long sleep they spent almost
all the next day getting ready that means the
earthly day on the side of the earth turned to-
ward them on which they could plainly see the
american continent it became night while the
lunar day of fifteen earthly days still had about
seventy-two hours remaining

  they ate bathed in water made by melting
lunar snow and carefully considered everything
they were very cautious in the selection of their
food they avoided all unnecessary liquid and ate

of the numerous preserved foods which were keep-
ing perfectly fresh almost nothing but some ten-
der meat they did consume a great tin of frozen
oysters which they found

  they had to manage to secure the highest pos-
sible nutritive value with the least possible waste
matter the impossibility of opening their arti-
ficial skins even for a second forced them during
the entire long trip ahead of them to give up all
eating and also to suppress all human needs

  they were again equipped as on the first day
it was entirely indifferent at what hour they
started since it was light on the moon

  the journey was far from simple on the map
they had determined that the high crater-moun-
tain lay some seventy kilometers northward but
of course they could not use the terrestrial com-
pass they had no idea how the compass needle
would behave on the moon thus they had only
the possibility of guiding themselves by the earth
but the latter was dark this night by way of
parallel to the terrestrial new moon there was a
sort of new earth to be sure the earth was
not invisible but was covered with a soft reddish
light and this earth along with the constella-
tions the position and motion of which egon had
been observing all day had to serve as their
guides

  for the three men now well rested the trip
was at first splendid they did not feel like hu-
man beings but like giants with lighfj springy
strides they hurried on not feeling the weight of
their loads at all with their alpenstocks they
leaped readily over rifts ten and fifteen meters
wide if anything put a damper on their delight
in travelling it was simply the fact that they
could not converse together again and again
egon who often stopped to make observations
had to hurry after his frivolous young compan-
ions and admonish them in writing not to leap
too rashly a fall into one of the deep crevasses
perhaps causing broken bones would have been
terrible

  at first they felt as though they were jumping
along on springy rubber cushions they had the
sensations of unpractioed skaters not yet able to
keep their balance

  the region became wilder immense blocks
were heaped up to make steep slopes and hillsides
a mighty mountain towered before them their
jumping had to be done more cautiously but even
the mountain offered them absolutely no trouble
it took an hour and a half before they had reached
the summit which now proved to be an extensive
ridge

  again they beheld an impressive sight the
huge so-called crater of plato lay before them
the mountain wall sank down in immense icy
steps going steeply down for several thousand
meters to a vast plain it looked like a frozen
ocean on which little islets rose up as well as
very tiny craters looking almost like ships on this
ocean

  it was the mightiest and most superhuman
skating rink that a fantastic imagination could
picture to itself the crater of plato which when
seen from the earth presents almost the impres-
sion of a volcano proved to be a plain almost
	wonder stories quarterly

a hundred kilometers across which appeared low
only in comparison with the mountains of the wall
about it whereas the sharp light reflections show-
ed it otherwise to terrestrial telescopes in this
plain the spherical shape of the moon was plainly
evident to the north higher mountains rose
the lunar evening and the closer proximity of
the edge of the moon that is the limit of the half
which we can see from the earth made the oblique
suns rays produce huge shadows stretches which
looked like newly fallen snow alternated with
other stretches which appeared grey or very dark
where light rime covered the ground the glitter
of the ice blended with the grey of the shadows
to make dark tones which shaded off into black

  great fragments cast dark shadows and made
enchanted giant forms or huge monsters on the
frozen slopes the latter themselves now pre-
sented the appearance of vast lava beds which
had suddenly frozen to ice in the midst of an
eruption a most uncanny sight this dead
world this complete silence this motionlessness
and over everything slowly moving along the
shadow pictures of colossal ghostly beings

the coining of the meteor

egon had often bent over to see whether loose
snow were present on the icy surface but he
had found none he pointed with his hand and
they continued on their way they went north-
ward along the ridge the indentations became
wilder and more jagged more and more fre-
quently they encountered wide deep abysses into
which they had to climb it was well that the
american had wrapped around his shoulders the
lasso which apel had put in the rocket for con-
tingencies

  now the going was more difficult they had to
tie themselves together and jump at the same
time on the earth such travelling would have
been simply impossible hours passed and they
went higher and higher toward the north the
mountains became wilder and greater the shad-
ows longer and longer at times they had to
pause and egon always determined that there
was no loose snow either up on the heights or
down in the low places

  they had been eight hours en route eight
hours of uninterrupted climbing jumping and
walking behind them was such a march as no
person on earth would have made now they were
again on the top of a ridge where they sat down
on the moon with its chill of space it was quite
indifferent whether they were high or low in the
north or on the equator they themselves due to
their artificial skins and their oxygen to breathe
were like little individual worlds the differences
in temperature caused by the solar radiation or
by night were imperceptible to them

  up on this summit which already far north of
philolaus was not even marked on egons map
not only was egon seized with the greatest ex-
citement but also the feeling of an extraordinary
moment came over his young comrades as well
to the south from which they had come lay a
deep twilight gradually becoming brighter until
far in the distance the mountain peaks whiph they

had crossed hours before shone in the brightest
and most glorious sunshine but on the other
side it was absolutely black as totally black as
if a wall blocked vision here even the stars
which here too shone down from space in their
hard brilliance could not send a gleam of light
into this half of the moon now temporarily turn-
ed from the sun and always turned from the
earth

  there stood the three men hand in hand for-
getting their weariness their souls quickened at
the immensity of the thought that they were the
first sentient beings the first men to whom it
was granted to gaze into the nightly blackness of
the half of the moon eternally invisible to the
dwellers on earth

  they were sitting again on a block of ice aware
that their journey had come to an end here be-
cause it was useless to descend into the night but
they did not consider that the aim of their journey
had been vain they did not think of the fact that
ten hours of a frightful return march lay before
them they were unable to tear themselves
away

  suddenly it became brighter they looked up
a little star far brighter than the others was in
the sky its light became more and more intense
and it rapidly came nearer

  a meteor a shooting star

  all three knew what it was they saw the
meteor speeding quickly on toward them they
might perhaps have felt a warmth but the airless
space here remained unmoved whereas on earth
a fearful cyclone would certainly have been pro-
duced

  it took only a few seconds they stood close
together their hearts almost stopped beating
they felt as though the meteor would strike them
and crush them for a few instants everything
became as bright as day it showed a landscape
exactly like that over which they had travelled
full of mountains and abysses full of white ex-
panses and towering craters all this appeared
out of the darkness and then the meteor struck
it struck the moon tore up fragments of ice and
rock and bored a huge hole but all this hap-
pened silently as if in a picture cast on the screen
of the silent movies

  egon shouted aloud for joy although he knew
that no one could hear his voice for some sec-
onds the spectacle was of indescribable beauty
but this beauty filled him with a feeling of infin-
ite good fortune the meteor had smashed into
countless pieces and wherever these little white-
hot fragments struck they lit up a thousand
times more brightly burning for a few seconds
with a very luminous flame only to go out again
very quickly overcome by the cold

  this had lasted only a few moments and again
the black world of night extended before their
dazzled eyes it was now so dark about them
that egon could not even write but he beckoned
with his hand took a little electric flashlight
which he had brought along in spite of the head-
shaking of the two reporters lit it and began
with quick steps to go down the mountain the
other two followed hesitantly
between earth and moon	

  it was a relatively gentle slope on which egon
now descended into the depths like a mountaineer
the two had to stay above for about them it was
dark and they could not have ventured following
him into the abyss 

the long long road

two hours passed during which korus and the
american had to stand idly up there and
simply watch the tiny light of the flashlight the
only thing they could see in this absolute dark-
ness moving about very far from them

  at last they perceived that the little dot of
light was again approaching them two more
hours passed while egon was very slowly climb-
ing the mountain apparently with difficulty

  he reached them and sank evidently exhausted
to the ground now up here in the twilight they
saw that the empty knapsack which egon had
carried on his back was now full to bursting and
that he had also brought along in his left hand a
great chunk of frozen snow

  it took egon a long time to recover then he
stood up and gestured to the others since it was
too dark for writing to take off their knapsacks
at the same time they saw that egon no longer
had the ax which he had taken down with him

  they did not well understand it all but when
they saw egon take off his knapsack remove from
it some great chunks of ice strange ice which
seemed to be granular frozen snow and when they
saw him break up with the second ax the block
of ice which he had brought under his arm finally
packing everything into the three knapsacks they
felt that egon must have found something im-
portant not merely some pieces of the meteor

  they set out and travelled again toward the
light their bodies were weary very much ex-
hausted and were craving sleep but the feeling
that every step brought them nearer to the light

fave them strength this chill harsh heatless
ight seemed like a kind friend to these men who
felt as though they were coming up out of hell

  the going was terrible their weary feet
threatened to give out the hunger of the long
hours weakened them they were tormented by
thirst for the first time since they had left the
earth they felt sweat breaking out on them and
it felt as though this sweat made the artificial
skin stick fast to their bodies

  again and again they had to rest again and
again their eyes closed and they had to shake one
another to get rid of the overpowering sleep al-
most twenty-four hours had passed since they had
left the rocket when finally they stood again on
the crater wall of plato

  it already almost seemed to them as though
they were at the end of their journey yet between
them and the rocket was still almost seventy kilo-
meters two long days of tramping if they had
been on the earth at least it was again bright
about them and they could write on the tablet
though with trembling hands

  we must throw off the knapsacks we cannot
keep on

  egon read this shook his head and wrote we
must take them with us i hope that we are
saved

  this word saved had a magic effect the
other two had become far too much accustomed
to rely on egon without any question for them to
have doubted they rose again and once more
tried to jump

  now the way was downhill and this made going
easier though more slow than at first egon had
to collect all his power to find the way again but
then it seemed to all of them as though they were
already at home as though all trouble and dan-
ger were over when at length they saw from a
great distance the slender body of the rocket
waiting for them just as they had left it shining
in the earths rays

  exactly twenty-six hours had passed by the
time the three dead-tired men finally stood be-
fore the rocket again and took off their knapsacks
as egon directed

  even now egon motioned to them to wait an-
other moment he took the second ax and broke
from one of the chunks of snow-ice a piece about
a hand-breadth across of course he had to sac-
rifice the knapsack for this in the meanwhile had
been frozen with its contents into a single solid
mass

  they tvent very cautiously into the air-lock and
then rushed into the cabin while egon carefully
closed the door again now this narrow cabin
was like a pleasant home to them they removed
one anothers helmets and drew deep breaths
though the air in the cabin was already pretty
bad but likewise the oxygen cylinders in the hel-
mets were almost completely used up so that in
the last hour breathing was very difficult after
some time they forced their weary hands to open
some tins of food which they ate without caring
what it was

  all right and korus sat on the padded bench
and watched the strange procedure of egon
even during the undressing for dinner he had kept
looking at the little piece of frozen snow-crystals
which he had placed on the floor now he took
a little pair of tongs and held a needle with it
made it red-hot knelt down and very cautiously
held the glowing needle over the frozen mass

  it does not melt it does not become water

  the two did not understand why egon was so
happy about it but he again made the needle red-
hot went quickly over to the lump of ice and
stuck the still slightly glowing needle into the
mass of snow

  now the two journalists also jumped up and
watched more closely instead of being extin-
guished the needle glowed very brightly and be-
gan to burn with a bluish flame

  the two could not understand what does that
meanthey asked

  egon had forgotten all his weariness we are
saved said he the meteor has shown us the
way to salvation this is oxygen snow frozen oxy-
gen pure oxygen without any mixture of hydro-
gen for otherwise the mass would have melted to
water or would perhaps have formed detonating
gas now we are saved for the present

  but in this moment which took a great care
from his mind his nervous energy had reached
its-limit he simply lay down on the floor and
went right to sleep korus and the american si-

both of them stood as tho turned to stone there were
gigantic letters in the sky-s-o-s
between earth and moon	

 lently followed his example a few minutes later
 if an outsider had suddenly entered the cabin he
 would have seen just three peaceful faces of com-
 fortably sleeping men

an oxygen frenzy

 it was only about three hours later that the
 american suddenly awakened and began to
 laugh loudly he laughed so boisterously that
 korus woke up and stared at him

 what is the matter

 it is so incredibly funny

 korus looked into his laughing face and also
 burst out laughing

 you are right it is terribly funny-it is a
 scream

 while they were trying to see which could laugh
 louder egon woke up also

 korus slapped him on the back and shouted
 come on boy join in and be happy

 at once egon also began to laugh

 they stood up forgetting all about sleep and
 their weariness korus clasped the american
 and tried to do the latest negro dancesteps with
 him while egon-the usually so serious egon-
 accompanied them by singing loudly and beating
 time on the electric stove with the tongs

 matters went on thus for a while when korus
 suddenly shoved the american back

 you are crazy he shouted

 all right reddened what did you say fel-
 low he cried

 korus evidently was becoming enraged take
 that back you scamp he screamed you are
 to blame for the whole trouble

 look out little fellow you cant call me a
 scamp

 for heavens sake yelled egon give me a
 chance to rest

 both the others turned to him now you are
 starting things they shouted you have no
 buisness to talk to us

 it is my rocket

 nonsense it belongs to mr allister

 be so good as to shut up

 they all yelled wildly at the same time korus
 and the american rolled on the floor and wrestled
 together the more uproar they made the more
 common and vulgar their expressions became
 like those of guttersnipes apparently all three
 had forgotten that they were educated men

 suddenly egon who still had the most self-
 possession saw the little lump of ice on the floor
 it had become very much smaller he roared at
 the others the devil wont you keep still
 trembling in all his limbs purple with rage he
 took the bit of ice and threw it out the door into
 the air-lock then he worked a lever after a
 while their voices suddenly became quiet the
 two fighters were squatting on the floor with their
 clothes almost torn from their bodies they were
 covered with sweat they gazed stupidly at each
 other until korus finally said what happened
 egon sank smiling on the bench forget all
 about it he said i am to blame for it

 how so

 explain

  we simply had an oxygen frenzy

  an oxygen frenzy

  i told you that we had found pure oxygen i
left the frozen lump lying here and went to sleep
the electric warmth of the cabin and the heat of
our bodies slowly changed the frozen oxygen to
gas of course this gas was distributed about in
the cabin and the air which was already begin-
ning to be poor in oxygen became far too rich in
it excessive amount of this vital gas cause vio-
lent excitement mr all right dreamed of some-
thing funny woke laughing and so made us join
in that caused our extreme merriment but
then the excitement increased and we became ir-
ritated as is always the case when people lose
their self-control we scolded and beat one another
like street-urchins it is a good thing that i had
enough intelligence to notice the lessening of the
lump of oxygen and to throw it out

            lets not despair 

with eyes full of astonishment korus an-
swered probably we would have killed
one another

  maybe but it would not have needed that to
finish us an excess of oxygen would finally lead
to stupefaction and to a death by suffocation just
like too little oxygen

  they laughed again but this time it was with
pleasure they shook hands all around

  the air is fine now

  the apparatus now has the right mixture and
is working as it is supposed to

  the american sat down on the sofa it is
strange he remarked that i no longer feel
tired

  we have had a sort of ozone bath

  korus smoothed his hair lets not bother
about sleeping said he come on doctor give
us a good cup of coffee

  unfortunately we must start to economize with
our heat one of the two storage batteries is al-
most exhausted we have certainly been too free
with its use

  what difference said korus with a laugh if
we are now saved

  for the present we have only a reprieve
  what does that mean 

  it is the same as with the man who went out to
look for an egg and found a roast pike

  you must put that more clearly

  well then we absolutely need hydrogen and
oxygen to have the possibility of returning to the
earth hydrogen i hoped to find and heaven has
given us pure oxygen gentlemen it is a price-
less gift tomorrow a new trip would have used
up the last three cylinders and in a few days more
the air in the cabin would also have been used
up since the apparatus was no longer working
for want of oxygen

  then we are saved after all

  yes for the time being at least we can
breathe and if my hope is realized that all i
have in the three knapsacks is pure oxygen then
we are provided for on that score we can keep
filling our cylinders and be sure that we can al-
ways replenish our supply in that crater on the
other side of the moon
	wonder stories quarterly

  well then what more do we need

  we have discovered one more thing the possi-
bility that persons in heat-proof habitations can
live on the moon on the supplies of frozen oxy-
gen

  but cant we leave

  no our rocket engines work with detonating
gas that is with the explosive mixture of hydro-
gen and oxygen if we do not find the former
then we must remain here

  korus replied carelessly then we shall make
a colony on the moon

  egon said rather bitterly yes for as long as
our provisions hold out according to the rations
thus far used that will be for two or three weeks
at most

  korus shrugged his shoulders yesterday we
had three days left said he to-day we have
three weeks i think we have no reason to de-
spair gentlemen let us not allow the good cof-
fee to get cold

chapter vii

night and new despair

the lunar night had commenced at last it
had suddenly started one day when they
awoke the last light of the sun had disappeared
all three fully equipped were standing in the
outer door of the air-lock very much surprised
it was not dark on the contrary in the last few
days when the sun had a more and more oblique
position in the sky and mighty shadows of the
mountains stretched out everywhere it had been
darker now the shadows had vanished along with
the sun the earth was in the sky with its dully
luminous disk yellowish and cold much as the
moon is to us now that the sun had disappeared
with its stronger light they could recognize all
the more plainly the outlines of the contents on
the earth

  suddenly the american gave a sob the others
did not hear it for he had his oxygen helmet on
his head and here in the open there were no
waves to carry sound but they saw by his con-
vulsive movements that something strange was
happening to him then he turned and went
again into the cabin although egon had forbid-
den them to use the air-lock any oftener than
was absolutely needful

  at first the other two did not notice much to
be sure they saw very plainly with the naked eye
that the american continent stood out on the
earth but their eyes were much more occupied
with what the moon had to offer them

  it was actually ridiculous to talk of warmth on
the moon which lay at all times in the field of
spatial cold yet it now seemed to them as though
it must be colder

  the warm tones of the sunlight which had af-
ter all brought a little variety into this horrible
landscape making the ice-fields shine the points
and depressions glow and the lowlands sink into
gloomy shadow had vanished

  all about lay the yellowish light of the earth
over all this monotony over these almost uniform-
ly round walls of the craters out of whose midsts
still smaller craters rose the absolute dead-

ness the impression of desolation was now far
more strongly expressed the hopelessness of
this region was complete this region which mil-
lions of years before had surely been the scene of
the wildest tumult one could picture the first
volcanoes bursting out from the rigid mass pour-
ing forth their contents of liquid fire within the
lava fields still smaller volcanic tubes had swelled
up like bubbles until everything froze in the infin-
ite cold and in this freezing the shell burst until
it looked like what now met the eyes of the travel-
lers in the harsh uniform and melancholy light
of the earth it was a dead heavenly body which
had never possessed life it had passed from
fiery heat to the rigidity of death without ever
forming as the earth did a layer of soil which
fanned by a mild air and moistened by water be-
came a comfortable home for man and beast and
plant

  it was dead barren cold and horrible for the
living beings who had been brought here korus
stood perfectly still egon felt a child in his
heart as though this lunar night were weighing
down on him

  he thought again of the american while
korus now leaped from the rocket down to the
moon picked up bits of ice and threw them into
the air probably only to divert himself egon went
back into the cabin

  the american had taken off his oxygen helmet
and was sitting on the bench his hands before
his face weeping

  what is it mr all right

  the latter started and stared at him forcing
a twisted smile he said  nothing

  egon put his hand on his shoulder and said
we have become friends after all

  suddenly the american threw his arms around
him this very man who was always brief in
speech who always seemed a bit distant toward
the two germans gave vent to the sudden out-
burst of a deep feeling i have seen my home
egon understood the american needed to say
no more but he also recognized at once the dan-
ger of what was going on he himself knew how
a few moments before outside he had been held
by such thoughts

  stop sir we must keep our heads we must
return and we shall return

  the american laughed loudly saying you do
not believe it yourself

  you are ungrateful kind heaven has given
us the oxygen and we shall also find the hydro-
gen

  the bitter look on the americans face did not
vanish rtif we do find it said he the rocket
is damaged the apparatus was broken at the
start and we are lost you know that as well as
i do it is best for us to end matters

  but all right

  the american bent close to his ear for egon
also had taken off his helmet

  he whispered very softly what do you say to
this we wont say anything to korus we will
have a good dinner and drink champagne much
champagne all we have then you and i-harm-
less little korus need not know anything about
it-will fetch in the big lumps of oxygen and start
between earth and moon	

the electric heat the champagne will make us
merry and so will the oxygen at first then we
will go to sleep and suffocate and awake no more
all will be over

  we cannot do that cried egon

  then all right took him by the shoulders with
his face close to egons and gazed at him with
horror egon saw that his eyes had taken on a
strange unsteady wild appearance

  the american muttered to him do you want
to wait until we are all insane i am becoming
so already this morning i plainly feel that i
am becoming crazy

  egon comprehended the danger of this moment
and said very firmly and convincingly while he
looked fixedly at him get rid of such thoughts

i have been studying the map and the books about
the moon and i think i know very well where
we shall find hydrogen take your helmet and
come along we have no time to lose

  at these loud energetic commanding words the
american shrank together for an instant then
he rubbed his hand over his forehead and at once
there returned to his eyes a happy light

  do you know where there is hydrogen
  yes

  it was evident to egon that at any rate he had
to speak definitely and assuredly

  all right became actually joyous then let
us be quick said he of course i am ready
before putting on his helmet he took egon again
by the shoulder dont say anything about it
to korus he said it is my nerves it is the
result of what happened to me in an explosion
and i should not like to have him laugh at me
my word of honor on that

  now the attack seemed over and the american
was again his former self he seemed to have
forgotten everything but egon still felt the ter-
ror in his heart

  at this moment korus put his head through the
door asking arent you coming at last

  we are coming mr all rights helmet wasnt
working properly

i believe we have found hydrogen

they went over the ice this time toward the
south again they came to high mountains
with steep peaks and abysses though the pion-
eers did jump up easily those mountains were so
traversed by rifts and chasms that on the earth
they could hardly have been climbed at all

  sometimes it happened that one of them slipped
and fell forty or fifty meters they had long
given up tying themselves together since they had
seen that even such a fall was not serious on the
moon because the one falling floated down gently
and landed with a barely perceptible shock

  they had travelled for four hours and were
now standing on an elevation here a crater
landscape extraordinarily wild in itself was cut
by deep deep rifts and fissures egon wrote on
his tablet the alpine valley which was the
name he had found on the map

  the sight of this wild scenery of craters and
ever more craters of round walls forming wide
circles with countless tiny craters strewed about

within them this ever similar horrible picture
would have depressed their minds far more than
the first sight of the lunar night that morning if
the trip they had j ust taken the good exercise of
this everlasting climbing over the mountain-tops
had not refreshed them and given them uncon-
sciously a joyous feeling of victory such leap-
ing over abysses and climbing almost inaccessible
mountains gave them the consciousness of a su-
perhuman power supermen are not extremely
ready to give in close before them was a very
steep descent into an extraordinarily deep place
and egon used the telescope

  it seems to me that there is grey frozen snow
down there

  the american read the tablet took a look down
through the telescope and began to slide down
the steep slope before the others could prevent
him

  it made them dizzy to see all right descend
like lightning for hundreds of meters on the mir-
ror-like surface then he jumped and beckoned
to them from a ledge

  egon and korus followed it was only when
they stood below that they saw the danger in
which they were the ledge which they had
thought from above to be the bottom of the crater
was only very narrow from there it went down
extremely steeply in a manner impassible even
with lunar conditions into a black abyss so deep
that they could not see the bottom in the dull light
of the earth but before them on the little ledge
there actually lay a grey mass which was no
regular ice but rather frozen snow

  this time they had not brought along the large
ax they had only one now because egon had
left the other in the oxygen fields but they had
little hatchets with which they broke off a chunk
of frozen snow and divided it up for their knap-
sacks

  again egon wrote on the tablet we need not
take too much it is not a long trip to this place

  the ascent was very painful they had simply
slid down and now they had to cut every step of
the way with the hatchets it took hours for them
to reach the top but then they returned with
rapid strides to the rocket

  the american was again quite his old self and
seemed to have forgotten his fit of depression
when egon now broke off some fragments from
the lump of snow to test in the cabin the other
two remained outside and amused themselves by
using their alpenstocks as javelins and throwing
them great distances

  egon was content that they should remain out-
side and entered the cabin when he switched
on the electric light he felt for the first time how
dark it had been outside he again heated a
needle red-hot and stuck it into the snow it went
out again at once but there was likewise no for-
mation of a drop of water about the glowing
needle it was therefore neither ordinary ice nor
oxygen

  in his joy egon went to the air-lock and called
ont i believe we have found hydrogen
	wonder stories quarterly

an explosion

then he went back into the cabin where he
had placed the lump of snow on the hot elec-
tric stove and looked for the spectroscope

  korus and the american had been rather far
off looking for their javelins and they had of
course not heard egons call they had however
seen him up in the air-lock of the rocket and had
supposed he was beckoning to them

  they went slowly over to the rocket where
korus was the first to enter the cabin he gave a
loud cry and beckoned to the american the doc-
tor who had of course taken off his helmet during
his investigations lay stretched full length on
the floor apparently dead

  dont take off your helmet-poisonous gas
here-you cant breathe hydrogen-get the oxy-
gen quick

  after they had made their discovery of oxygen
they had filled their cylinders now korus open-
ed one and held the open valve close to the mouth
of the apparently dead man so that the pure
oxygen flowed into egons lungs the american
wanted to help and had the feeling that korus
could not see well he felt for his flashlight but
instead found in the pocket of his leather suit a
box of matches thoughtlessly he struck one

  instantly there was an explosion egon and the
american were hurled through the door which
had not been entirely closed into the air-lock at
the same time the great glass window broke and
the fragments flew outward then it was all
over

  egon still completely stupefied sat up on the
floor the american was leaning weakly against
one of the walls but korus who had been given
careful instructions by egon as to the rocket and
other scientific matters had presence of mind
quickly he seized a lever and made the metal
plates fall in front of the broken window he
carefully closed the outer door turned on the elec-
tric heater and likewise shut off the oxygen cylin-
der which during the last few minutes had been
pouring its contents out into the cabin

  all this had taken place with incredible rapid-
ity the air was again fit to breathe and the
chill of space had not entered the cabin during
these few moments to such an extent that the
heater could not warm it up quickly

  only now were the three able to recover from
their fright but the american who had indeed
removed his helmet like the others sat again on
the bench with staring eyes

  egon had risen feeling a painful headache but
able to think clearly again he pressed koruss
hand while the latter inquired what actually
happened i found you lifeless on the floor

  egon reflected i had put the ice on the warm
plate said he it was not hydrogen at least
not pure hydrogen it was chiefly frozen carbon
dioxide when i became aware of that i wanted
to hurry out but it was no longer possible if
you had come a moment later if you had not
blown oxygen into my mouth at once i should
have suffocated

  but the explosion

  quite correct there must have been hydro-
gen after all probably both were hurled up from
the crater in unthinkably early times freezing at
once to crystals and both being united in the
frozen masses there must have been hydrogen
in the cabin which united with the oxygen flow-
ing from the cylinder to make detonating gas
but where did the spark come from which ignited
it

  a right struck a match

  egon felt all right again in here he said
little harm was done it is a mercy that the door
was open and that the window pane gave way so
easily everything seems to be tight and sound
for the rocket still keeps in the heat the explo-
sion was not very violent and simply exerted its
force out through door and window at any rate
the incredible hardness and strength of the beryl-
lium covering has stood another test brilliantly

  they looked about in the cabin the only dam-
age done was to trifling things

  now we will eat and after that we will put
on our helmets and examine the entire rocket on
the outside to see whether we discover any dam-
age

  while opening a meat tin korus said then
have we found hydrogen

  then can we go away asked all right

  the doctor shook his head this snow we can-
not use it is evidently too full of carbon diox-
ide we could not convert it into a gas without
continually running the risk of being suffocated
you are right there is hydrogen here and there-
fore it will surely be present in a better form
but we must seek further

a madmans act

they ate korus and helmstatter with a good
appetite while the american stared before
him and shoved the morsels into his mouth purely
mechanically

  the german reporter laughed aloud what
are you doing all right he said you are
eating with your fingers instead of with your
fork

  the american made up a foolish face and be-
came embarrassed while egon passed the matter
off

  after eating they put on their helmets and went
out though all right now seemed to have be-
come rational again the doctor cautiously gave
a hint to korus

  i do not know what is the matter with him
but he seems to me to be suffering from a nervous
collapse if you notice anything do not pay any
attention to it but just pass it off

  of course this conversation had to be written
on the tablet like any other now they exam-
ined the rocket but it did not appear to have
suffered any injury indeed at the window the
artificial skin was not destroyed but showed
cracks and breaks

  meanwhile it had become evening of course
everything was the same at all times but they
had retained the earthly habit after being twelve
hours awake of calling it evening when it wa
ten in the evening by terrestrial time they said
it is night and went to bed in reality there
between earth and moon	

were still fourteen days of the eternal lunar
night

  of course it was pitch dark in the cabin after
the three had stretched out as usual on the floor
and put out the electric light there had been a
large window only on one side which now was
destroyed on the other there was nothing but
a round porthole through which the dull light
of the earth cast only a very feeble glimmer

  the american was as taciturn as usual but he
seemed perfectly normal

  how are you mr all right

  thank you i am tired and would like to sleep
after some hours egon was wakened by a noise
he perceived in the faint light that the american
was standing up with his helmet on and was now
leaving very softly on his toes he awakened
korus

  what is it

we must watch all right he has gone out
the young german was still sleepy dont
let him disturb us he said we are tired

  i am afraid that his reason is affected

  korus became wide awake all had long since
been accustomed to keep on the artificial skin at
all times then they needed only to put on their
helmets and their heavy boots the latter being
worn to protect the artificial skin and to preserve
their balance

  quiet

  what is it

  he is coming back again

  all right came in again carrying a great chunk
of ice in his hand this he placed on the electric
plate switched on the current and was going to
lie down again the eyes of the two men now ac-
customed to the darkness had seen all this

  now egon sprang up switched on the light
seized the chunk ran to the door and threw it
out

  all right what are you doing that is the
miserable carbon dioxide

  the american replied with a snarl of course
you had to wake up

  korus stepped up to him man do you want
to murder us

  i want to finish matters

 for a moment the three faced one another
speechless they did not even think of taking off
their helmets two stood in horror at the thought
of having with them a madman or at least a man
desperate to the point of suicide the american
stood with bowed head his fingers twitching con-
vulsively the narrow cabin and the strange
tone of their speech through the diaphragms in-
creased the horror of this moment

  suddenly all right made a move and leaped
out the door which he strange to say carefully
closed behind him

  he has lost his mind

  you saw it before when we were eating

  he wanted to kill us all

  and at the same time he has just this fixed
idea about the carbon dioxide he made such a
proposition to me earlier

  he only needed to open the metal protection
of the window since we did not have our helmets

on then we would immediately have frozen to
death

  we must follow him

  korus hesitated it is better for him to die
than for us to die with him

  he is a human being and we cannot let him
perish

  you are right

  the two stepped out not very far from them
the american was sitting on the ground and star-
ing at the earth he was dressed only in the arti-
ficial skin which protected him from the cold and
the oxygen helmet

  egon slowly walked up to him but when all
right saw him close at hand he jumped up with
gestures of terror and fled away

  then he knelt down and they saw him holding
the matchbox in his hand apparently he thought
he was in the cabin for he scratched one match
after another which of course went out immedi-
ately

  he wants to blow us up

  korus forgot that egon could not hear him
yet they understood each other separated and
tried to catch the american from two sides

  the latter jumped up and to their surprise com-
menced a rapid fire with pieces of ice which he
threw at them with giant strength then he
stood up to his full height raised his arms in the
air took a couple of mad leaps and began to run
he ran straight ahead in great bounds with the
other two after him

  the chase lasted for hours korus and egon
were bathed in sweat under their artificial skin
they were exhausted for they had covered dis-
stances which would have taken days on the
earth still it went on just the same and the
madman seemed tireless

  there was another mountain and another abyss
all right vanished from sight

  egon pointed down there

  the fact that the two could not even talk to-
gether increased the horror of this fearful night
below lay the american apparently dead when
they painfully managed to climb down to him he
struck out and struggled but he could not stand

  we must tie him

  egon had the lasso with him they bound his
arms and slowly carried him back to the top

  here egon took the tablet and wrote where
are we

  korus shrugged his shoulders as though to say
if you dont know im sure i dont

  in the pursuit they had completely forgotten
to notice where they were going there was no
trail how could a human foot make any prints
on the ice of the lunar night they wandered
about dragging the now perfectly insensible all
right they laid him down climbed peaks and
domes came down again and wandered further
always the scene was the same monotonously uni-
form

  at last egon pointed with his hand he had
recognized a peak he climbed up it and waved
his arms his keen eyes had seen the rocket
through the gloom

chapter viii

days of gloom

after two hours they reached the rocket
again they carried the american in and took
off his helmet he lay motionless and hie face
was ashy grey

he is dead

egon put his ear to his heart he is still alive
korus examined the helmet the oxygen was
exhausted he said he was at the point of suf-
focation

n

     mi

  all right opened his eyes and began to utter
groans as if in fearful pain my foot he
moaned

  now for the first time the two saw that on the
right foot of the american the artificial skin was
torn a black frostbite was visible through the
rip which fortunately was narrow they un-
dressed him and in the process observed that the
entire artificial skin had become rotten and was

illustrated by paul

high in space a solitary person was
floating-separated from
everything

 tearing under their hands it certainly could not
 be used any more

 all right moaned in pain egon got out the
 medical chest and gave him an injection of mor-
 phine he went to sleep

 it would perhaps be better if he were dead
 we must do everything to save his life

 he is mad and will keep trying to kill us
 egon was insistent then we will tie him but
 we must save him if we are able to save our-
 selves

 korus examined the foot and said the whole
 foot has already become gangrenous

 then it will have to be removed

 before going into journalism korus had studied
 medicine and served as assistant in a hospital
 they did whatever was at all possible they cut
 the destroyed tissue and bandaged the foot then
 they themselves sank down exhausted and slept
 for many hours when they finally awoke the
 american was lying with his eyes open softly
 moaning to himself

 how are you all right

 i have a great pain in my foot what has hap-
 pened to me

 you fell and tore the artificial skin

 must i die
between earth and moon	

  certainly not friend korus is half a doctor
you know

  what about the hydrogen

  i know where to find some egon thought it
well to keep him calm

  and then do we go home

  of course

  and i cannot help you we must start at
once i should not like to lose my foot and dr
hastings in frisco-

  korus and i are going for hydrogen today

  the american had no fever and spoke perfectly
rationally once more it seemed as though the
pain of his wound had collected his thoughts
again he ate and drank with them then egon
arose

  i must go on the search alone he said you
must take care of him

  he put on his helmet and went out the door
again there was the same dreadful landscape
he reflected where should he look now sure-
ly there was hydrogen on the moon but where

  he travelled in another direction he went for
hours this time all alone ice everywhere ice
it was such solid ice that even where it seemed to
be frozen snow it was hard enough to chip the
edge of his hatchet when he tried to break off a
piece

  he seated himself and refleeted yes that was
natural even if the sun had not been completely
able to melt the lunar ice yet in the incessant
heat of the two-weeks lunar day it had become
brittle while now the cold made it freeze fast
again he thought matters over it was useless
to seek further he had chipped his hatchet in
some places where there certainly was snow they
would simply have to wait until the lunar night
was over twelve days more

  this was a frightful thought the cabin had
no window now and they had to be very sparing
of the light the storage battery would under no
circumstances work for twelve days and they
needed electric power and warmth for the start

  in the cabin was the invalid with a perhaps fatal
injury to his foot there was also the possibil-
ity that at any moment madness and suicidal
mania would seize him again

  while egon sat here all alone and reflected he
did not break down on the contrary a firm de-
termined look came to his face he ran over it
all again he had found oxygen and hydrogen
though the latter was in an impure state but
after he had found it at all it must surely occur
unmixed

  he arose and walked homeward it did not
matter they just had to wait until the sun came
back and made the snow brittle again they had
food and drink

  he travelled for several hours according to
his opinion he should long before have seen the
rocket but however often he crept up on the sum-
mits he still saw only the uniform craters big and
little and no sign of the rocket gradually ter-
ror took possession of his body a cold sweat
broke out all over him

  he jumped along in great bounds he ascended
a high mountain hurrying so that his pulse beat
faster in spite of the lessened exertion and look-

ed about craters mountains all bathed in the
yellowish light of the earth but not a sign of the
rocket now he fully realized that he had lost
his way he was wandering alone on the vast
moon and at the same time complete exhaustion
came over him

korus sees visions

korus was sitting in the rocket while the
american was lying on the floor a violent
fever had set in and was making the invalid
quiver now he moaned in pain now he trembled
with cold and then again he imagined all sorts of
nonsense

  korus was young only twenty-five a gay and
joyous fellow who had hardly thought of the ser-
ious side of life now he began to get anxious

  he looked at his watch egon was to have re-
turned in five hours and six had passed it might
take him longer he might perhaps have found
hydrogen and be coming heavily laden korus
forced himself to be calm and tended the invalid

  eight hours

  the american had fallen into a troubled sleep
under the influence of the strong dose of quinine
which korus had given him and which had dimin-
ished his fever

  the young german could no longer bear to
stay in the cabin he took his oxygen helmet and
went out all was still nothing could be seen
but the yellow light of the earth bathing the great
dead field of ruins of the moon he climbed the
nearest peak leaping up for a whole hour and
continually looking around he took the tele-
scope which had lenses adapted to nocturnal use
and looked about in the land nothing

  ten hours had passed

  one idea kept making him shudder the doctor
had had an accident he was somewhere help-
less he would not return again and here was
he alone with the invalid helpless and alone
even if he had everything even if the american
got well they could not even tell what hydrogen
and oxygen were they did not know how to fill
the rocket motor or to control it he felt cold in
spite of the artificial skin but it was a chill from
within that made him shudder

  again he looked about emptiness

  but yonder there was a shadow something was
coming no it was nothing

  and now his overtaxed nerves thought they
saw figures everywhere men who approached
him and looked like egon and then suddenly turn-
ed to mist before his eyes they crept up out of
the depths monstrous forms with spongy limbs
and huge heads they came from all sides al-
though he knew he could hear nothing he heard
voices the mocking laughter of these ghosts his
horror increased in the depths of a crater ha
saw a light-a light that had not been there be-
fore now it became larger and larger he stood
up feeling his knees tremble

  great pieces of the surface were thrust aside
down below they must have been metal sliding
doors he plainly heard the rolling and rattling
of great machines

  involuntarily he went toward the light now
he saw figures down below little figures with
	wonder stories quarterly

gigantic heads climbing stairs which led up from
vast subterranean rooms

  living beings they came toward him almost
fungus-like hands touched his soft squeaky
voices which he strangely understood bade him
come along they led him below and removed
the diving helmet from his shoulders

  he was able to breathe he walked down the
stairs following them with a beating heart he
felt that it was not in his power to refuse obedi-
ence to these things he went through a mighty
room in which tremendous machines the gigantic
forms of which he had never seen before revolved
their wheels and raised their iron arms then he
was in a vast hall brilliant with gold and jewels
it seemed to be the hall of a subterranean palace
at table sat a great number of persons eating
they were dressed in soft flowing robes of various
colors all of them had huge heads and snake-
like limbs

  moon people his heart beat more anxiously
moon people frightful monsters and on a
platform sat an apparently very old man with the
hugest head of all all this struck him as horri-
ble yet as not at all unexpected now two leaders
came out of the crowd and stepped up to korus

  the entire hall was lighted by a bluish light
but the creatures were at the same time veiled
in a grey mist these creatures had long thin
worm-like arms and legs as well as incredibly
large heads the man in the lofty throne seat
however had still more attenuated limbs but an
actually colossal sphere for a head out of which
two piercing little eyes looked forth and these
eyes which gave the impression of a mighty brain
looked questioningly at him while at the same
time strains of supernaturally beautiful music
came to his ears the man up there began to
speak in a soft piping voice and then suddenly
the mist vanished and everything became perfect-
ly clear with horror korus saw whole hordes
of such lunar beings come in carrying the rocket
on their shoulders then he felt himself seized
by slimy hands and bound with chains

  korus gave a loud cry the american lay
stretched out dead on a bier beside him stood
egon bound as he himself was the squeaky
voices were talking louder and louder and all the
figures in the hall were taking on threatening
looks

a terrible predicament

pgon started felt the ground giving way under
him slid down and stopped somewhere

  he looked about and could have shouted for
joy now he knew where he was he recognized
the spot the ledge projecting out in the deep
crater where he had found the carbon dioxide
snow two days before

  he climbed up the mountain again from this
point he knew the way to the rocket

  korus was still in the frightful hall the
horrible lunar figures were swaying about him
like ghosts the long arm of a machine was de-
scending upon him he knew that in the next
instant this machine must crush him he felt its

iron clutch strike heavily on his shoulder and he
fell down

  at this one blow everything had vanished the
whole hall with the moon people had sunk into
nothingness and about him was the bare yellow-
ish lunar landscape bathed in the light of the
earth

  before him stood egon with his hand on his
shoulder he was now pulling him along an
hour passed during which korus staggered along
on egons arm as though stupefied and then they
stood before the rocket before the rocket which
was floating right over the surface of the moon
just as he had left it

  they entered the cabin the american was ly-
ing in a peaceful sleep they took off their hel-
mets egon laughed at observing that korus still
had an absent look in his eyes

  you are a frivolous fellow korus i found
you fast asleep on the last mountain peak

  the young man stared at him was i asleep
  fast asleep

  and what about the men in the moon in the
underground hall that i saw

  in a few words korus related what he had
seen

  have you ever read wellss book about the men
in the moon

  of course

  then you simply dreamed what the novelist
told you

  the doctor became very serious we have
both of us again had a piece of good fortune i
lost my way in the night while you fell asleep
from exhaustion and had a dream think what
you may i believe that fate has good intentions
toward us else we should never have seen each
other again and how is the invalid 

  he seems to be sleeping peacefully evidently 
the fever has lessened

  they sat down and ate egon was contented
and at the same time rather ashamed

  have you found anything

  we must wait until the lunar day returns
korus i have a feeling that we two must also
take care of our nerves

  they sat there in silence

  the time for sleep arrived the american still
slept calmly at any rate his wound did not
seem to have become worse the night that is the
sleeping time of the men passed undisturbed with-
out having bound all right again

  the next day was as fortune would have it
the fourth since the sun had disappeared all
right was awake

  have you some hydrogen

  i cannot carry it alone the load is too heavy
korus has to take care of you

  the american shook his head i feel better
i can perfectly well remain alone for some hours
i beg of you if you know where there is hydrogen
go and get it we must not lose a moment we
must do everything possible to leave this fearful
place i had a horrible dream i thought i was
insane i saw myself get up secretly in the night
and carry the block of frozen carbon dioxide into
between earth and moon	

the cabin and destroy us all go get the hydro-
gen and save us

  we will get it

disaster and new hope

he beckoned korus to follow him took his
helmet and went out he had to be alone
and think the american felt better and had
overcome his fit of nerves at this moment what
he had actually done seemed to him a dream
he was calm because he for the moment believed
he would be saved what was to be done
should he actually make an attempt with korus
which would surely be just as fruitless as those
before should he tell the american the truth
and thereby run the risk of seeing him collapse
again even if he risked a new attempt did he
dare to leave all right alone was it not to
be feared that just the absolute solitude would
again completely upset him was there not the
possibility that if new mad ideas came to him
he might destroy the whole rocket

  he could find no solution he also felt that
young korus could give him no advice and that
the entire responsibility rested on him he had
jumped along a few strides and was standing on
one of the smallest craters meanwhile korus
who had bandaged the americans wound had
appeared up at the exit of the air-lock

  egon saw him and beckoned to him but
then he was seized by a sudden horror he
thought that he too was being frightened by
ghosts he saw something that could not be
happening the rocket was beginning to vibrate
beginning to oscillate very distinctly as if moved
by a violent current of air and here in the moon
there were no currents of air

  still more he himself swayed plunged to the
ground lay on his knees and suddenly there
was life about him on the dead rigid moon
there was motion the whole region began to
get this uncanny life the crater walls wavered
the ground opened up as though by a magic
hand there was dug a very deep rift a valley
little pieces of ice were whirled up and sank
down again while with lightning speed a deep
ditch or valley opened and the ground split open
as though cut by a knife

  all this took only a few seconds it was a
phenomenon which he would have called an
earthquake if it had not happened on the moon
a moonquake he looked up at korus and saw
him fall faster than usual headfirst into the
depths of the newly formed abyss at the bot-
tom he lay motionless

  egon leaped down forgetting that at any
moment the pit might open up more deeply that
perhaps-for what did he know about the inner
fires of the moon-a volcano might start an
eruption

  all remained quiet korus lay motionless with
his helmet crushed by a great block of ice which
a person could not have moved on the earth
egon was seized by the most terrible anxiety
he rolled off the ice picked up korus whom
he was fearful of losing and carried him into
the cabin of the rocket the ship was now per-
fectly motionless

  are we starting already cried the ameri-
can

  he did not reply but took off the helmet korus
was uninjured except for a few bruises but
when he undressed him he saw that not only the
second helmet but also the artificial skin had suf-
fered it was not torn but cracked and no longer
suitable for use

  what happened

  egon had understood all this nothing but
the fact that the cold of the lunar night burst the
coating of ice which had become brittle in the
sun another new discovery this explains the
channels in the moon that suddenly form

  he could not remain in the cabin he stood
in the opening of the air-lock not venturing to
descend lest ne fall victim to a second quake
especially since no one could now rescue him be-
cause the other two suits were destroyed

  all remained quiet the rocket which was
moved by the quake only by the pull on the an-
chor rope was now motionless meteors were
flying across the sky as frequently as often hap-
pens on the earth in certain months a glowing
spark rushed down and egon involuntarily
ducked very close to him a tiny meteor struck
the moon and burst into glowing sparks single
ones flew close by him and fell into the fragments
of frozen oxygen they burned with a bright
flame

  then-his breath stopped a spark had pene-
trated a block of snow which he had also fetched
from yonder from the other side and did not
burn but went out

  egon jumped down the shock had split the
piece of snow he took a little bit and ran to the
cabin without answering any questions he got
the spectroscope switched on all the lights
looked through it and shouted hydrogen we
have hydrogen

  they did not understand him they looked
at him in the belief that his mind was affected
but the miracle had come to pass during these
past days he had vainly wandered about the
moon and the hydrogen was right here he
had found it the first day he had not investi-
gated all the chunks he had assumed that they
all contained oxygen probably he would never
have noticed it perhaps he would have suf-
focated them all if he had brought the blocks of
ice into the cabin even if only this one block
was hydrogen it was ample for their needs

  he explained matters in a few words there
was a celebration in the cabin korus fetched
out a bottle of champagne and the american
looked on with bright eyes

  we have hydrogen we have everything
we must just wait until the lunar night is over
then we will repair the rocket using the rest of
the artificial skin from the useless garments to
strengthen the outside of the rocket be patient
for as soon as day comes we shall be off

  the moonquake and the meteor fall had saved
them rather it had not saved them but given
them a possibility of safety the three men sat
together in the narrow cabin and saw a ray of re-
turning hope in the depths of the fearful lunar
night
	wonder stories quarterly

chapter ix

the coming of day

the twilight of the new lunar day came slow-
ly when the first oblique rays of the sun
illuminated the cheerless expanse it was like a
release from imprisonment to the three men

  the last four days had imposed an incredible
strain on their nerves the american was suffer-
ing great pain in his foot and the mobile korus
could hardly control his impatience at being in
the narrow space of the cabin

  during these days they had not left the rocket
at all the second of the two storage batteries
was barely half charged and since two of their
three garments of artificial skin had become use-
less they had under any circumstances to be
sparing of the electricity and simply use it for
keeping the cabin warm

  every time the air-lock was opened part of the
heat was of course lost the chill of space came
in if only for a few seconds forcing them to heat
up again by electricity

  so they completely gave up leaving the rocket
although freedom of motion would have done
them a world of good they sat in the dark
cabin with the batteries of the two flashlights
charged for extreme cases of need but they did
not dare tobum a light

  from their supplies they had selected food
which could be eaten cold they opened the tins
in the dark and they also ate in the dark

  it was not absolutely dark as in the darkest
night on the earth there was also here a very
faint half-light which enabled them to find their
way about once they were used to it

  nevertheless each day and each night was be-
coming a torture if the thought of the hydrogen
they had found had not repeatedly supported
them they would have broken down

  they spent almost all day telling one another
of the sufferings of north polar explorers in ear-
lier decades who had had to spend a whole half
of the year in the darkness of winter

  but at any rate those men had air to breathe
and they were able to go about they had the
possibility of going hunting and shooting polar
bears and walrusses they could busy them-
selves and seek some diversion to kill time

  but these three men were sitting idle in a very
narrow room with nothing to do but wait they
did not even have a feeble candle-light

  there were times when they silently brooded
when they lay down to sleep they were wakeful
for they were not tired

  egon kept saying three days more then
the sun will return then we shall fill the tanks
and start

  of course we shall start

  the other two agreed more loudly than was
necessary yet neither of them actually believed
it nor did egon himself

  the sun was there it did not help them it
merely brought the decisive moment nearer yet
the imprisoned men breathed more easily

  egon dressed himself in the last suit they had
of artificial skin he examined it very carefully

and utilized the first light which came to them to
glue on great patches made of the other two
wherever the skin of this garment seemed to have
become thin only one of the helmets was ser-
viceable now

  now i will go out and examine the exhausts

  it was not easy to be able to stand up in the
cabin they had so anchored the rocket that it
floated horizontally above the moon

  egon had to climb out struggle along to the
stern and try to get into the machinery of
course this rear room had to be shut off heat-tight
from the rest of the rocket because otherwise the
open exhausts would have let the chill of space
come in

  egon cautiously slid along the polished hull of
the rocket and arrived at the exhausts the
frightful shock of the premature start had done
a great deal of damage the soldered places be-
tween the pumps and the exhausts were broken
badly for hours egon sat bent over in the tiny
space and reflected then he unscrewed the
broken exhausts and brought them into the cabin

  anxious eyes awaited him

  will it go

  it must go

  they thought matters over

   soldering is entirely out of the question

  how could they have heated a soldering iron
here since they had no blast-lamp

  again a little of the precious electric power
had to be sacrificed while the other two were
hammering away in the cabin to repair the pis-
ton-rods and exhausts egon ran an electric wire
around the rocket pressed ordinary snow around
the broken places warmed it electrically and let
it freeze again it was a desperate thing to caulk
the connections with ice if it would only hold
at the start

the last toast

three more days had passed--three terres-
trial days-and still the brilliant sunlight
still lay over the moon unbroken by any night

  the work was done and the rocket again in-
tact even if the repairing was only very primi-
tive the great containers were filled with hy-
drogen and oxygen gas for this they had had
to sacrifice some of their heat because it was on-
ly in a gaseous form that it was possible for them
to flow from the exhausts and mix to form deton-
ating gas

  egon had also stowed great amounts of hydro-
gen and oxygen snow in solid form in the rear
of the rocket there was certainly the danger
that they would warm up combine and explode
it did not matter they had to take a supply along
with them

  they sat together in the cabin lately they
had become accustomed to speak little now
egon took one of the champagne bottles and
opened it

   if it is all right in your estimation we shall
start after dinner

  he purposely spoke in as indifferent a tone as
though it were a matter of a simple journey

  the american nodded and said all right
between earth and moon	

  do you think it will be successful asked
korus

  i do not know myself replied egon serious-
ly we must settle whether we want to risk it
i have got the apparatus into as good order as i
possibly could it is to be hoped that it will again
work properly but it is equally possible-that at
the first electric spark the ignition will blow up
the whole rocket into a thousand atoms i can-
not judge whether my repairs will hold i have
no possibility of determining to what extent the
apparently undamaged pipes have been made
brittle by the cold of space it is therefore easily
possible that the pressure of the lever with which
i commence the ignition will mark the moment of
our death

  can we remain here the american asked
with a set face

  certainly not

  korus who had long since given up his eternal
merriment said in a determined voice here
we are dying slowly it is impossible to find food
on the moon besides which our life would be use-
less here doctor if you have merely a ray of
hope of saving us by making the start i am
ready

  egon nodded if i were alone i should risk
it there are three of us and so i must have your
agreement

  the other two held out their right hands to
him

  now we will be men we will no longer
speak of the danger but we will cling to hope
gentlemen let us unite in one the three beautiful
toasts which the englishman in a foreign land is
accustomed to drink our home

  our distant friends

  the women we love

  they raised their glasses emptied them and
sat a while in deep thought

  korus arose now let us not be sentimental
said he now we will eat well the best that
we have left and drink another bottle it may
be the last meal of the condemned but i believe
we shall succeed i will believe in that

  bravo korus

  how different things had become formerly
the two had been intruders and now they felt
that all were united in close friendship

  they ate and drank korus made jokes and
they even laughed then the two reporters
cleared the table and packed everything away so
carefully that it could not be all mixed up on
starting egon put his helmet on once more

  look out now while i point the rocket up-
ward again

  he stood outside viewed his work for the last
time and took his final look at the fearfully im-
pressive desolation of the frozen moon he took
one more look at the heap of ice where they had
buried the cylinders containing their notes out
of it projected the alpenstock to which he had
fastened the german and american flags

  stirred by no breath of air they hung limp-
ly how long would it withstand destruction
he still hesitated even this departure was be-
coming hard for him then he pulled at the rope
and pointed the rocket toward the earth-the

earth whose brilliant disk was right above him

  at this moment his soul was filled with home-
sickness as well as with hope for a moment he
collected his thoughts for a short prayer to the
almighty then there remained only one last
thing to do with a sharp blow of the ax he cut
the frozen anchor-rope on the earth it would
certainly have made a report like a rifle-shot
when the rope which was frozen taut sprang
asunder here everything was still the de-
parture was to be as noiseless as the arrival

  the rocket moved slightly not because of a
breeze but because of the displacement of its
centre of gravity egon held the rest of the rope
in his hand while his feet still remained on the
moon he was the only connection between it
and the rocket

  he climbed up the rope and stood in the en-
trance to the air-lock taking one more glance
around then he resolutely entered closed the
air-lock carefully secured it and went into the
cabin fastening the door of that also

  we have got so far anyway

  there was still a little to be done lowering the
window protections stowing away the diving
helmet and regulating the warmth of the cabin
once more they sat together on the floor in
this case because when the point was upward
on the back of the padded bench

  now in gods name

  egon pressed the ignition lever and all three
clasped hands the clockwork which would
cause the ignition after a few minutes began to
hum it was the same humming that had so
startled the three in new atlantis that day that
seemed ages past

  fearful minutes passed in which no one said a
word while each stared ahead with teeth
clenched then came a jerk a violent oscillation
of the rocket a frightful swinging back and
forth which tossed the three up into the air

  in the next moment they lost their senses ex-
actly as they had formerly at the start from new
atlantis

  they had thought of everything but one the
fact that the attraction of the moon was only an
eighth as much as that of the earth they had
therefore not considered that it would have
needed only an eighth as much energy to hurl
them upward and that now if the apparatus did
chance to be working properly they were travel-
ling eight times as fast as they had before

  streams of fire rushed out of the rocket one
explosion followed another bits of metal flew
about falling on the oxygen snow and burning
with a bright flame while a tiny glowing dot dis-
appeared faster than the speed of thought into
everlasting space

chapter x

the world forgefs

winter snow lay over the wild mountains of
yellowstone park on atkinson peak al-
most buried in snow and cut off from the outer
world stood the observatory and the great work-
shop forty meters high and put together with
iron ribs where waldemar apel lived
	wonder stories quarterly

  the buildings were warm in spite of the win-
ter for the clever engineer had made use of one
of the hot springs which cast up their hot spray
all around even in the winter and had converted
it into a natural central heating plant

  there were only a few persons who lived up
here waldemar apel two well-tried mechan-
ics an old married couple as servants and irene
allister

  four weeks had passed since the catastrophe
in new atlantis had occurred and the rocket had
vanished in the ether the first few days were
devoted to constant work joe allister had come
after them to fetch back his only child but his
words were in vain he had shrugged his shoul-
ders and returned to frisco

  waldemar apel had given his word not to ven-
ture a journey with the second rocket during the
winter under any circumstances unless the first
rocket itself sent a call for help this last was
impossible days had passed and no observa-
tory in the world had announced anything news
at all of the three space voyagers

   the greatest refractor on earth in the observ-
atory at chicago had watched the moon night
and day for an entire week but it had not ob-
served the least thing and the fact that once a
meteor plunged upon the moon from distant
space could not have anything to do with the
rocket yet this was the meteor that showed
egon the oxygen it was only natural that the
tiny rocket which was not white hot like the
meteor remained unnoticed

   joe allister was again in frisco it suited him
perfectly that his daughter should spend the win-
ter months at atkinson peak he could rely on
apel and the agreement had been made now
everybody claimed to have suspected beforehand
that the rocket was a piece of folly now every-
body laughed at old allister for having thrown
a million or more into the moon

  now they were mocking at the love of the mil-
lionaires daughter for the crazy doctor it was
well that she did not hear it as for her sacrific-
ing her small property what difference did that
make she was after all allisters only heir

  great lorries had gone to the observatory
shortly before the winter snow covered the roads
a whole army of mechanics had been at work
in the great workshop the second rocket stood
ready for departure resting just like the first on
spring supports above it the dome of the work-
shop could at any moment be so moved by press-
ing on a machine that the rocket could ascend
it completely resembled its twin-sister only that
it was perhaps still more carefully built

  irene had been a clever and practical assist-
ant she had soon comprehended the entire
mechanism she understood every lever and
every wheel here too a large supply of food
and drink was loaded in likewise garments of the
artifical skin and oxygen helmets but more of
everything than in the first rocket

  irene was always liberal we must have so
much of everything said she that we can give
some of them away we must have the possibil-
ity of being en route a long time seeking them

  at the same time the little padded cabin pre-
sented an almost homelike look for feminine
taste had understood how to beautify many
things

  from the very first they had worked day and
night with one man always at the radio receiver
and another at the telescope making observa-
tions a week passed no word came from
space the newspapers were silent and the
earth in the press of the daily happenings was
forgetting the rash attempt of the three men
three fools or one fool and two frivolous ones
who spoiled his work

  there were only a few scientists who lamented
the attempt which had failed the masses
shrugged their shoulders and the world which
was living altogether too fast to heed such things
forgot them

  a whole week had passed without any happen-
ings

  apel said to irene dont you want to return
to frisco

  she looked at him in terror then do you also
believe that all hope is lost

  you have a brave heart what does all hope
mean the rocket did not return to the earth
it would have had to reach the moon according
to my velocity calculations in five days let us
assume that the impossible happened that the
pilots were even able to land and to set out again
then another week could go by

  irene remained the second week and also the
third then the winter was so far advanced that
she had to remain even an airplane could not
have fetched her away because up here there
was no place to land

  apel smiled now you will have to stay here
all winter with me he said

   now all is lost is it not

  yes according to human understanding we
must mourn egon helmstatter as a gallant man
who sacrificed his life for his work it would
have better if the yacht had reached new at-
lantis an hour later then none but those at
fault would have suffered

  and what do you intend to do

  to wait until spring and risk a new attempt
with the second rocket

  with me

  not without your fathers consent

  irene did not answer but went to her room in
the evening she seemed perfectly calm from
now on without ever saying anything about the
rocket she was constantly in the observatory as
waldemar apels assistant

an s-o-s

the fourth week was over and a winter storm
was blowing about the peaks of yellowstone
park there had been a frightful storm and it
howled about atkinson peak and shook the
buildings snow and sleet had poured down
while the whole force of winter beat against the
building in which the people lived

  irene allister had chosen for her room a tower-
chamber right under the dtfme of the observa-
tory while apel sat below at his desk she stood
between earth and moon	

at the window and looked out she saw the
clouds sweep by and the lightning flash and she
heard the thunder roll through the mountains
with a thousandfold echo

  gradually the storm passed but in the east was
a vast dark-grey bank of clouds announcing the
coming of more snow irene was sunk in thought
she liked to stand at the window and gaze out
into the storm what was this little violence of
the terrestrial atmosphere compared with what
the travellers to the moon had had to endure in
space she became lost in fantastic and mourn-
ful reflections

  then she looked out again and her eyes took
on an amazed and staring look the great bank
of clouds had vanished it was a clear sky now
but up in this sky was something written it was
in great black letters s-o-s it was as though
written by a ghostly hand in the heavens

  irene thought she was dreaming she pressed
her hands to her head and closed her eyes when
she opened them again she saw s-o-s once more

  irene raced down the stairs and burst into
apels room for heavens sake come quick-
ly she cried

  what has happened

  either i have become crazy or else a frightful
catastrophe-

  apel jumped up she seized his hand and
drew him along up the stairs to her room she
pushed him to the window

  dont you see something

  both stood a moment as though turned to stone
cold sweat ran over them apel started back
and cried there are letters up in the sky
s-o-s

  human beings in trouble

  irene seized him by the shoulders signals
from the rocket she cried

  let me think a moment

  she cried out almost exultantly signals from
the rocket

  the telephone rang loudly apel seized the
receiver this was the message he received
this is allister something incredible is being
seen here gigantic signals in the sky the let-
ters s-o-s can it be the rocket

  perhaps replied apel

  the conversation broke off apel sat at the
desk because irene lived here and because this
room was close to the observatory they had the
telephone here

  i must think a minute

  irene was still at the window the signal re-
mained the same always the same letters s-o-s

  again the telephone rang this is the chi-
cago observatory reports are coming in from
all over the world from berlin paris moscow
and yokohama in the last hour a strange phe-
nomenon has been seen everywhere there are
great letters in the sky s-o-s can it be the
rocket

  irene stood in the middle of the room with her
hands pressed to her heart she listened to apel
repeating what he heard and listened to his re-
plies

  cant you see anything in the sky

   it is still too dark

  for heavens sake get an exact observation
and report to me

  now he ran back and forth in the room it
is the rocket there is no doubt it is the rocket
who else could give such signals

  irene sobbed it is in danger

  but where is it how is it possible that it
can give the signals to all parts of the earth at
the same time

  irene rushed to the telescope i cannot see
anything she said my eyes are blinded with
tears

  the sky is all full of clouds now we must
wait

  she wrung her hands meanwhile they are
going to destruction

  the bell rang out loudly through the house
the two mechanics rushedinto the room

  get all ready for the start of the rocket
the men stood still not understanding the en-
gineer

  irene pointed out the window dont you see
s-o-s

her knees trembled that is the rocket
chapter xi

a new predicament

for a moment the rocket was apparently mo-
tionless in the tiny cabin the three men
were crowded together trying to rid themselves
slowly of the frightful attack of nausea dizzi-
ness and depression of course they were no
longer on the floor or the bench but floating in
the air

  now the velocity meter began to register again
at first it did so slowly then faster and faster
then much faster than it ever had before after
only a few minutes there was a jerk in the little
casing-the instrument was broken

  the new and very extraordinary velocity and
the renewed acceleration had not been so un-
pleasant in their effect on the travellers as the
start from the moon because the velocity had
been expressed not jerkily but by a constant even
increase

  after the velocity meter was broken and the
ship had assumed a definite even motion nothing
of this motion was any longer felt by the occu-
pants

  all right the ever contented one held on to
the metal rail so that his feet touched the floor
and he seemed to be standing in normal fashion
he tried to smile

  what is happening now he asked

  egon pale and still struggling against a severe
attack of nausea nooded and said yes yes
korus who had seated himself on the bench
looked anxiously at him what do you mean
by yes yes

  let me rest a moment the matter is quite
clear to me let us first have a drink of cognac
they drank right out of the bottle and very
soon they began to feel better first they
straightened up the little cabin a bit and the
american pressed the button which sent back the
beryllium plates from before the pane of the little
round window
	wonder stories quarterly

  he looked out and gave a loud cry i think
the whole universe has gone crazy

  it was a fantastic sight the pitchblack sky
was strewn with thousands of stars but these
stars seemed to be racing around the rocket like
an orrery gone mad

  with a quick pressure egon closed the window
while the other two looked at him in horror all
right said with a rather shy and hesitant glance
at helmstatter are we really standing still
egon had collected his thoughts the whole
thing is actually very simple said he we left
the moon in exactly the same way we left the
earth previously there is this difference that
we did not succeed in replacing the exhausts and
the hidden parts of the rocket as they were at
first and there is the second difference that we
this time had no auxiliary rocket to cast off
things have gone with us just as with fritz opel
in his second trial trip at berlin with the rocket
automobile the exhausts did not kindle one af-
ter another in the proper succession but in wild
confusion almost all of them at once therefore
the concussion was extraordinarily stronger and
more fearful than in our start from the earth it
is actually a wonder and a proof of the excellent
construction of our rocket and of the strength of
the metal that they withstood the shock of
course the lord deserves most of the credit the
machine we call man is indeed incredibly re-
markable as shown by the fact that we have the
satisfaction of being alive

  the american interrupted him but-
egon paid no attention let me finish speak-
ing the matter is not so simple and i must
think it out by a look into the rear room
through this pane of glass i have convinced my-
self that there actually remains of our whole
rocket not much more than our especially solidly
built cabin see for yourselves

  he pressed the button making the plate slip
away from the rear pane of glass as he had done
before when his two friends were still almost
stunned he turned on the little searchlight be-
fore the window

  the greatest portion of the rear part of the
rocket had disappeared wildly distorted and
jagged bits of metal stuck out all the rods and
tubes that had been fitted in the complicated
mechanism in this rear room were now stretched
out at great length as though pulled straight out
by machinery it hung behind the ship slightly
bent downward looking somewhat like the tail
of an airplane

  korus cried out why we are a wreck
  egon nodded that is what we are

  likewise the american had lost his humor
then have we no more possibility of independ-
ent motion or control

  egon shook his head no we have lost all
our independent motion

  then are we standing still

  not just yet we are moving with such vel-
ocity that our measuring apparatus went on a
strike and preferred to break

  i do not understand

  it is simply an example in mathematics by
the almost simultaneous but irregular ignition

  of the exhausts and by the explosions of our total
supplies of hydrogen and oxygen converted in-
to detonating gas and exploding in a few rapid-
ly successive shocks we got two results we were
not only hurled ahead at an almost incredible
speed but we were also diverged from our
course so that we did not approach the earth
vertically but instead encountered its force of
gravitation tangentially at something like a right
angle we had better fortune than fritz opel
whose auto could not help being smashed when it
diverged from its course for in space we had
sufficient room to let ourselves be propelled for-
ward even in zigzag lines accordingly when
our fuel and therewith our independent motion
came to an end we met the orbit of the earth in
such a way that we necessarily at the speed we
had were obliged to commence rotating about
the earth we now became a second moon
though a very little one and that is what we are
at present

  then we are lost

  quite the contrary if our own impulse had
perchance sent us beyond the orbit of the earth
then perhaps we should have become a new
planet with an orbit around the sun

  thank you very much

  how long our wild course lasted i do not
know since we lost our senses still it must have
been a considerable time for i had wound my
watch just before we left the moon and now it
is almost run down therefore almost twenty-
eight hours must have passed our departed
measuring apparatus also indicates that in this
time we have traversed the almost incredible
distance of one hundred and eighty thousand
kilometers

egon explains

the american still shook his head but then
i do not understand why our excellent velocity
meter has given out at our present speed which
is surely less

  in the scientific explanations the two had com-
pletely forgotten their desperate situation

  our velocity is after all not so very slight if
we just figure things out the moon encircles the
earth in thirty days otherwise expressed it
does so in two and a half million seconds now
let us reckon further taking into account the fact
that we are not as i first assumed about half-
way between the earth and the moon but that we
have traversed in our mad course almost three
quarters of the distance back the radius of the
circle which we have to describe is therefore a
much smaller one and besides that we struck
the orbit of the earth tangentially at great speed
i cannot determine with exactness the velocity
with which we are encircling our dear mother
earth but it must be enormous

  the american gave a loud cry and korus
stared in horror at egon then we are hope-
lessly lost

  all right tried to summon up a bit of reck-
less humor and to make a jest i must certainly
notify my employer to send me my salary by the
next mail
between earth and moon	

  korus gave him an angry look but egon said
calmly what doeslostmean at present we
are still alive it has been a miracle that our
rocket was not smashed we still have on board
food for about three weeks kind fortune has
granted that our air machine was not broken
since we are in empty space in spite of our great
velocity there is no heating and consequent melt-
ing of the apparatus to be feared thus we have
at least two weeks before us

  and then we are sure to die

  dear mr korus what is to happen in two
weeks need not frighten us to-day

  korus looked at him i am not cowardly
said he if i look the facts in the face we are
lost for you yourself have said that we possess
no means of getting ourselves out of this orbit
before us lies exactly the same fate as has often
befallen the crew of a submarine we still have
food and air but we know exactly when these
will come to an end the only difference is that
in the case of a submarine there is the slight pos-
sibility of help coming from outside while in our
case this is impossible

 why

  first because there is no second rocket avail-
able

  the american contradicted if i am right
waldemar apel built two rockets

  korus went on do you consider it possible
for anyone to see us from the earth

  egon shook his head with our small size
and our immense distance from the earth we are
so tiny a grain of dust that even the best tele-
scope would not see us at most it might happen
that a very keenly observant astronomer-and i
admit that this is a very improbable chance-
would see from time to time a very faint shadow
whisk across the lens of his telescope

  korus shrugged his shoulders in vexation
but then-

  then you are quite right in saying that we
shall not be seen from the earth if we do not
make ourselves noticeable to the earth

  how can that be done

  by our making signals to the earth that
could be done in two ways professor oberth
had advanced the theory that it is possible by
means of a number of metallic mirrors of sodium
which are fastened on a wire net to produce re-
flections which are not only visible on the earth
but which also according to oberths assump-
tion even possess such radiation power that one
can warm with them entire parts of the earth
which are otherwise frozen i have thought that
with such a mirror which i have on board one
might be able to send a morse signal to the earth
but i do not know myself how practicable this
is i have a second idea on the subject you all
know the sky writing done for advertising pur-
poses by aviators

  according to my own ideas i have already
built an apparatus of which even apel knew
nothing it must be considered that the arrange-
ment used on the earth would not work here
first we are moving with such velocity that the
writing would be distorted and second in the
airless space we could not simply use vapors

  and last of all the letters would have to be mons-
trous to be seen by chance by astronomers or
maybe even by the naked eye my apparatus is
so arranged that very fine metal dust placed in
exhausts set obliquely would be driven very rap-
idly out into space by a miniature rocket using
hydrogen and oxygen this dust would go
through a stencillike device having the form of
the letters s-o-s through the placing of the
exhausts this writing is spread out very exten-
sively the metal dust makes it legible thus
perhaps one could write gigantic letters which
could be seen from all parts of the earth the
mirror signals even if they would not be noticed
from the earth would be in reserve to point out
the way in the higher strata to a rocket ship
that might be seeking us

a new hope

dut how will you do this

  jo there is no difficulty at all in leaving the
rocket through the air-lock in a diving suit as we
did on the moon standing outside one could
then give the signals with my writing machine
and at the same time spread out the net and
fasten it to the rocket then those remaining
behind would have to pull back into the rocket
the one outside in case he could not get himself
back

  do you believe that a human body can stand
the velocity out there

  that does not come into question for us since
there is no resistance or friction to be con-
sidered

  korus was still doubtful which way are you
going to send the signals

  that does not matter since we are moving
around the earth very fast the signal which we
can repeat several times will surely be seen
somewhere in inhabited regions

  while korus sat there thoughtfully reflecting
about what egon had said the american nodded
his head vigorously

  fine in this way we could imitate the signs
of the morse alphabet and send the new york
evening ledger a whole account of what has hap-
pened

  of course we could agreed egon but at
present i think we shall limit ourselves to one
signal

  the two looked at him

  s-o-s he said

  there was a moment of absolute silence
very slowly this tiny gleam of hope began to
take root in their hearts if it did not prove to
be their salvation still it was an idea an activity
an attempt

  all right threw back his head suddenly may
i venture a remark

  egon gladly received this attempt at a care-
free spirit

  mr all right has the floor

  i am frightfully hungry

  the electric heating plate was brought out of
the cupboard egon satisfied himself that one
battery was still fairly well charged some cans
were opened and the contents prepared the
fourth of the ten champagne bottles was un-
	wonder stories quarterly

corked and they ate with the healthy appetite
of men who indeed knew the seriousness of
their position but likewise knew themselves for
the moment out of danger

  egon had examined the diving suits

  one suit and one helmet are uninjured but
there is only one oxygen cylinder left which can
be used

  then we have only one chance to give the
signals

   i hope that it will be sufficient

  egon took one of the smallest sodium mirrors
opened the little medicine chest and got out a
roll of black plaster he pressed this al over
the mirror that nothing was left of the brilliant
surface but the letters s-o-s very plainly shaped
then he took from a cabinet an apparatus not
unlike an ordinary fire extinguisher

  see this is my machine up here is the
screen with the letters s-o-s punched in it in-
side the case is very fine black metal dust and
here is a very long hose we fasten the little
rocket to this hose as soon as i am outside you
korus will set the mechanism in motion thus
so that the exhausts will commence to operate
about five minutes after i have left the rocket
then the metal dust will be projected into space
with great force exactly in the form of the
s-o-s

  thoughtfully the two regarded the apparatus

  now give me the diving suit

  no me said korus

  you must give it over to me i was the one
who made the mirror and the writing apparatus

  helmstatter dressed himself in the suit he
took the wire net with the mirrors over his arm
the writing apparatus in his hand and was ready

  all this was a mighty load which he would
not have carried on the earth but here he hardly
felt it about his body he had buckled a belt
and to it he had fastened the thin rope natur-
ally his hands as well as his whole body were
covered with the artificial skin which prevented
any loss of warmth

  now i shall enter the air-lock and you will
close it airtight behind me if i want anything
of you i have the bellbutton out in the air-lock
and we can communicate by means of morse
signals

a new disaster

he entered the air-lock after switching on the
oxygen cylinder in his helmet and the other
two carefully closed the airtight door behind
him all this was done as though it were some-
thing perfectly natural and self-evident egon
did not even press their hands in parting they
all knew very well that what was now to be
done would be the most frightful of all their ex-
periences they knew that in the next second
egon might perhaps be rent to atoms they
knew that the attempt he was now risking was
their only chance for rescue tiny and improbable
as it was

  egon stood for a moment in the air-lock
obliged to pause for a time until his heartbeats
became calmer he could not prevent his whole
life suddenly passing before him like a flash of

lightning in this instant he thought that he
saw two dark eyes gazing at him from some dis-
tant world irene allister

  quickly he opened the outer door of the air-
lock now he felt just as he had once before
as a student aviator when he had jumped out of
his burning plane at a dizzy height not knowing
whether his parachute would open or not

  nothing happened hesitantly he stepped
outside he had to push himself away from
the rocket with his hand he remained floating
motionlessly outside

  he hung the iron hook at the end of the rope
on a ring on the outside of the rocket and looked
about him

  he was unwilling to think he forced his mind
not to take in where he was he would not re-
member that the earth lay one hundred and
eighty thousand kilometers down below him no
not below him but apparently off at the right
it formed a huge disk on which his eye aided
by the keen lenses of the helmet could make out
as though on a terrestrial globe the continents and
countries

  it was morning on wide stretches of the
earth there still lay deep shadows

  egon took from his pocket a small bottle he
had thought of this in the it moment it con-
tained though only in a very small amount
the same mixture of hydrogen and oxygen as
was used for propelling the rocket this con-
tainer was also closed with a tube which could
be worked by a lever

  he opened the tube and a little of the gas es-
caped from the container since he held this
behind him he was slowly propelled forward un-
til the rope was taut he had a standing posi-
tion he was able to preserve his balance by
moving the bottle about and letting it flow out
in various directions

  in his right hand he lifted the little mirror
now the intense rays of the sun struck it
it flashed like a bruning-glass and cast the rays
toward the earth on those great still shaded
regions

  egon could not follow the course of the light
rays by eye very far he could not tell whether
they reached the earth or whether they made the
s-o-s visible to human eyes

  for a moment egon floated motionless before
the rocket then he felt a violent jerk which
pulled on the little rope korus inside the ship
had started the mechanism of the little container

  egon grasped the writing apparatus firmly so
that it should not escape from his hand and saw
how the metal dust was blown out of the ex-
hausts flying with great speed out into space
but then remaining motionless when the force
of propulsion was past

  the form taken by the writing was so exten-
sive that he could not take it all in he guessed
however that now a gigantic s-o-s in black par-
ticles of metal must be floating in space

  he looked about and at this moment his vision
dimmed and his heart nearly stopped beating
in the last quarter of an hour he had paid atten-
tion only to the mirror and the written signal
between earth and moon	

now the most frightful thing possible had hap-
pened

  egon was perfectly motionless the gas con-
tainer was empty but the rope which connected
him with the rocket was no longer fastened to
the latter probably the impulse of the writing
machine had sufficed to free the hook from the
ring the rope was floating freely in the air and
the rocket was at least twenty meters from the
end of it

    he tried to make swimming motions of
course it was in vain he encountered no resist-
ance he simply lost his equilibrium and had
trouble in floating back into it

  the rocket was apparently standing still but
he was moving to a degree hardly perceptible
more and more away from it he could not un-
derstand how in this moment of the most fearful
certainty of death he could think so calmly

  it was quite clear to him what had happened
he the only person in a diving suit a hundred
and eighty thousand kilometers above the earth
had become a third satellite a new satellite
although he did not yet know whether he was
destined to rotate about the rocket as its moon or
whether he was to fly about the earth a tiny par-
ticle more rapidly than the rocket

  the wire netting with the mirrors had escaped
from his arms it had unfolded and was now
floating in space between him and the rocket
about halfway

  he was seized by a paralyzing terror his
thoughts worked feverishly he was lost unless
he succeeded in reaching the rocket again

  a sudden thought flashed through his mind
why he had the oxygen cylinder in his helmet
if he should loosen the screw which closed the
helmet at the back of his head then the oxygen
which was compressed in the cylinder would
flow out of course with some pressure then
the oxygen would propel him ahead and if he
had good luck he would reach the rocket

  but with every atom of oxygen which flowed
out of the helmet there would also escape the
possibility of his living and breathing when the
supply was exhausted when the out-flowing gas
no longer closed the opening by its pressure then
through this opening the chill of space would en-
ter and freeze him to death in an instant

  he looked over at the rocket why didnt
they steer why didnt the two men help him

  inside sat the two with their anxious deathly
white faces pressed to the window pane seeing
him slowly move further and further away from
the rocket to be sure the levers of the steering
apparatus and the controls of the gyroscope were
still there but the steering apparatus and the
gyroscope were themselves gone only some
levers and rods projected out of the shattered
stern of the rocket into space

  the sun had risen brilliant and dazzling its
full force struck the rocket unprotected by any
atmosphere far below it lit up the great disk of
the earth making a glittering light flash from
the polar ice-caps

  out of the black eternal mantle of space the
constellations shone harsh cold and sharply de-
fined

  close beside them there flashed brilliant
sparks from the mirror-facets of the net which
was floating freely silently the rocket the new
satellite of the earth sped on its newly formed
orbit before it went the tiniest of all bodies in
the universe the grain of dust in space-the
living being still protected from the cold of space
by his diving suit with his lungs still breathing
the remnants of the oxygen in the cylinder his
senses still alert going to meet death with open
eyes

chapter xii

a last letter

since the remarkable writing in the sky had
appeared the rocket had again become the
topic of conversation of all the world almost at
exactly the same time the gigantic s-o-s had been
seen all around the earth

  the astronomers racked their brains and found
no explanation to be sure reports which could
not be checked came from all directions the ob-
servers at the huge telescope maintained that at
definite intervals a shadow was passing over their
lenses others thought this an optical illusion
and probably they were right

  unduly imaginative persons jumped out of bed
at night if any airship passed believing that they
saw the rocket

  harmless meteors were thought by over-zealous
newspapermen to be the remains of the falling
rocket

  all mankind was divided into firm believers and
mocking scoffers

  if the signals come from the rocket asked
the latter where has it been these four weeks

  yellow journals went in for depictions of in-
credible journeys through space seeing the rocket
already returning with treasures and strange
forms of life on board

  where has the rocket been

  where is it now

  the calls for help had come to an end again
day and night the most delicate radio receiving
sets had listened to space again all telescopes
all ships and whole armies of airplanes had ob-
served the earth and searched the sea the call
for help had come to an end but the rocket had
not plunged down anywhere thus there was only
one thing which was incontrovertible for ten
hours visible all around the earth there had stood
in the sky the huge uncanny s-o-s

  mr joe allister in frisco was greatly excited
joy and anxiety were struggling within him joy
at the possibility of the return of the rocket and
mortal anxiety for his child immediately after
he got the first report by telephone he ordered a
plane

  the pilot smiled

  i must get to atkinson peak immediately
we can fly there but it is imposible to make a
landing at present in the icy mountains

  then let me descend by parachute even if
the airplane is wrecked i must at once reach my
daughter
	wonder stories quarterly

  two hours later the monoplane in which joe
allister sat was mounting up into the heavens

  on atkinson peak they had been working fever-
ishly it was indeed night but the sky was per-
fectly clear of course the comparatively small
telescope showed nothing with the coming of
darkness and night the signals from space had
vanished

  waldemar apel was firmly resolved on start-
ing the second rocket was ready richly provided
with food and drink and having great quantities
of fuel on board while apel already dressed
under his suit in the artificial skin in case of any
contingency was giving the last directions below
by the rocket the domed roof was opening up and
the night sky was looking down into the great
hall

  irene had hurried to her room saying nothing
to apel in feverish haste she changed her
clothes putting on an artificial skin and over it
a leather sport suit she had disconnected the
telephone even more she had broken the con-
nection by cutting the wires she knew that her
father would prevent her and she was firmly de-
termined to accompany apel

  irene took from her desk a letter she had
written it long before right on the very first day
there it had lain and she had not thought that
she would be able to use it she read it once
more

  dear father man must act as fate requires
of him i promised myself to make the ascent
with apel if the rocket needs help i must do it
or i shall never forgive myself all my life

  if egon helmstatter dies we are to blame
both of us he wooed me and i demanded of him
to be sure half in jest an extraordinary deed you
have had the rocket built and have given him the
possibility of the journey in space we are to
blame

  i love you my dear father but i also love
egon we played together as children and i
saw him again as a mature man that i love
him that i have always loved him i only knew
after the rocket ascended before our eyes he
needs help if anyone can bring it to him i want
it to be myself understand me and forgive me
my dear father irene

alone in space

tie rocket was ready to start and waldemar
apel was just about to close the door hoping
that irene had changed her decision yet he was
sorry if he had to do without her cleverness and
her young strength after all but just then she
sprang lightly into the cabin

  you really intend to go

  she wore a look of determination i would kill
myself before your eyes if you refused to let me
accompany you

  get in

  apel had not broken his word of honor he
had only promised not to ascend if no call for
help came from the rocket and the s-o-s had
come

  at high speed the airplane was rushing through
the night in mortal anguish joe allister stood
at the window of the little cabin staring out
counting the seconds he saw the mountains rise
up he saw before him in the moonlight the peaks
of yellowstone park he drew a breath of re-
lief in a few minutes he would be there the
pilot had promised to land explaining that he
could do so by wrecking the plane

  already they had come down low already
joe allister saw through his binoculars the ob-
servatory then it became light there was a
flare of fire the mountain seemed to become a vol-
cano and then something shot high up into the
air a frightful gust struck the plane and whirled
it about but the pilot kept control of it high
in the sky a new heavenly body vanished draw-
ing after it a long fiery tail like a comet joe
allister lay on the cabin floor wringing his hands
and thinking only one thing too late too late
the plane landed close by the observatory
breaking its wings in landing but joe allister and
the pilot were unhurt
the millionaire leaped out ran over the snow-
covered clearing and reached the house he saw
that the air pressure of the ascent had shattered
asked where is the rocket

  the mans eyes were shining ascended safe-
ly and without accident

  where is my daughter

  gone into space with mr apel

  allister had enough strength not to collapse
he showed no weakness he had them point out
her room where he locked himself in and read
irenes letter

  he remained alone all night in the locked room
giving no answer even when they knocked on the
door nobody was to see that joe allister was
weeping for his last child

  high in space a solitary person was floating
separated from everything separated even from
the rocket his hand still convulsively clutched
the writing machine the mirror-net had slipped
from his hands and was floating somewhere in
space far below the rocket his thoughts worked
feverishly as long as he had still been able to
give signals with the mirrors he had at least had
something on which he could concentrate his
mind now even the written signals in the sky
were beginning to fade and he felt that it was all
over with him

  his breathing was getting difficult the oxy-
gen cylinder must be nearly empty it would not
have sufficed to propel him to the rocket even if
he had exposed himself to the deadly chill of
space if he had still been able to reflect clearly
he would have been surprised that he suffered so
little and that the twilight was coming for him
so painlessly

  in the cabin of the rocket were korus and mr
all right the american whose wound no longer
pained him lay on the floor while korus stood at
the little window the only one remaining and
looked out

  isnt the doctor coming back yet asked ah
right
between earth and moon	

  no he still seems to be making signals with
the mirror the giant writing which i certainly
cannot see the full extent of stands in the sky
it was only after some hours that korus under-
stood what had happened outside when he saw
the rope to which egon had tied himself floating
freely in space a fearful terror paralyzed his
limbs he turned to the american and said all
right now be a man

  what is it

  now pull yourself together

  do not keep me in suspense

  we have lost the doctor

  all right stood up what korus feared did not
happen he did not collapse

  tell me quickly what has happened or i can-
not stand it

  korus related what had occurred all right
said he we must save him

  we cannot he is surely dead already

  he is not necessarily dead he has the oxy-
gen he is floating a few meters away from us
the gravitational force of the rocket is holding
him near us we must save him

a second attempt

the american nodded still he said even
if it is only a single meter we cannot go out
into space

  i must

  it is your certain death

  that does not matter we are lost this way
too he is our only salvation and he is our com-
rade

  the opposite to what korus had feared had
happened all right had a determined face
where is the other artificial skin

  korus nodded i shall put on the torn skin
you know we have glue you will glue the rags
of the third skin over the tears for the few min-
utes i need it may hold out and protect me from
the cold

  give me the two helmets while you are dress-
ing i will find out whether one of them can be
made to do

  one helmet which korus had worn had been
crushed by the block of ice the other helmet was
indeed still undamaged except that the inner
pipe system was entirely bent out of shape

  there was feverish activity in the cabin the
american forgot his illness and hammered at the
pipes it was a painful task egon the techni-
cian would have done it more easily it took hours
and hours before they had patched up the ap-
paratus somehow

  too much oxygen will flow out

   i shall take only a little in the cylinder

  it then appeared that the work had been in
vain the entire pipe system was leaky

  korus nodded his head energetically then it
must be done without oxygen if only the helmet
is cold-proof i shall take one more breath of
oxygen here i am a good swimmer and pearl
divers can remain under water five minutes and
longer without breathing i myself have like-
wise remained under for a long time either i
shall succeed in a few minutes or else i shall not
succeed at all

  meanwhile korus had put on the artificial skin
it was torn in many places and the american
glued great patches over them of course we
cannot be sure whether this glue will stand the
chill of space

  korus stood all ready his helmet on his head
but with the valve still open so that he could
breathe he now took the long leather lasso and
also a small cylinder of oxygen he had seen how
egon had propelled himself with such a thing

  then in gods name blow a bit more oxygen
into the helmet and close the tube

  korus did not answer silently he brought in
all the cylinders then he bent down while all
right made some more oxygen flow into the helmet
and closed it

  they shook hands korus stepped into the air-
lock closed the inner door and went to the exit
for a moment he had to collect all his courage
when he looked out into space with the thought
of leaving the rocket he did not know the laws
of nature as egon did he did not understand
what he saw he was seized with horror

  egon was floating perhaps four meters away
korus had an idea the lasso was eight meters
long what if he simply remained at the exit
and threw out the lasso catching egon with it

  he tried to do so with all his might he threw
the slender leather rope but it did not fly out
it had no reason for flying ahead in airless space
then the end floated freely in the open

  korus clenched his teeth he tied one end of
the lasso tightly to the rocket fastening the other
equally tightly to his belt then he opened the
oxygen container held it behind him raised his
feet from the rocket and with beating heart let
himself be propelled out into space

  the start of the second rocket had of course
caused a tremendous stir though it was only a
few observatories that could see it in all the
newspapers there were articles several columns
in length great praise was given to the deed of
waldemar apel and irene allister who had
simply started out without any advertisemnt
without an artificial island and without any cere-
monial speeches

  to be sure it was generally felt that this new
hazard of human lives was useless

  what madness a rocket is launched into
space vanishes for four weeks and then sudden-
ly incomprehensible signals appear

  these are signals in which hardly anyone actu-
ally puts any credence and a second rocket travels
off into space to look for the first one

  it would be laughable if it were not so sad and
if it did not again cost human life

  still they gave praise to apel for the second
rocket had made a perfect ascent and had been
watched for hours by the observatories in its
slender beauty then it had become smaller and
smaller finally it had vanished into space a
tiny dot

  they spoke respectfully of joe allister who
had now lost his last child but nobody aside
from a few whom the public described as hope-
lessly incurable believed that anything would
ever be seen of the two rockets though this time
	wonder stories quarterly

also the empty auxiliary rocket was found float-
ing in the ocean a few days later

  waldemar apels rocket had made its ascent
exactly as its designer had anticipated by the
explosions of the auxiliary rocket it had been
propelled straight up and fast as lightning the
pressure on the two persons had not been any
worse than apel had calculated beforehand like-
wise they had not become insensible having mere-
ly become violently seasick for a few minutes
after which they had quickly recovered

  high up almost at the limit of the terrestrial
atmosphere apel cast off the auxiliary rocket
then he went as he expressed it with full steam
into space

  all that had taken place simultaneously and
violently in the precipitate ascent of the first
rocket occurred here slowly and intentionally
wonderfully smoothly the ship sped on its course
while apel and irene scanned the sky with their
telescopes

  kurt korus had left the rocket at first his
heart threatened to stop beating but then he
saw that he was gliding forward very gently and
soon he reached the body of egon

  he made an effort to grasp egon held on to
him and put his arms about him just the same
some minutes had passed egon had slipped
away from him several times now when he had
his arms about him he felt his senses leaving
him only too quickly had the air in the helmet
ben exhausted suffocation was beginning to
render him insensible

  all right had not been able to remain on his
couch he had slowly crept to the round window
he had watched korus seeing how he had reached
egon and how they then remained there motion-
less he considered matters in a flash desper-
ation gave him strength he stood up on his sound
foot he still had gloves of artificial skin he
pulled them on and put on his head the crushed
helmet then he wrapped about himself all that
there was in the way of coverings and bits of
clothing and drank a great quantity of rum to
warm himself internally

  he had no artificial skin but the thick cover-
ings and the increased internal warmth might
let him defy the chill of space for a few instants

  he crept into the air-lock shut the inner door
forgot his pain and pulled at the lasso

  there was no weight to overcome the two
bodies locked in close embrace floated closer
summoning up all his power he pulled them into
the air-lock pushed them into the cabin got in
himself and hopped about on his sound leg to
switch on the heat and release oxygen to replace
the lost air he felt himself collapsing he had
a terrible pain in his wound but his energy was
keyed up he opened the two mens helmets
made oxygen flow into their mouths poured some
rum between their lips and saw first korus and
then egon begin to breathe their eyes opened
and then he himself fell unconscious from pain

             chapter xiii
             a clue found

at the same velocity at which the first rocket
had travelled through space the second one
was now following it a day and a night had
passed and it was about to become the second
morning waldemar apel had forgotten that
irene allister was a girl in her leather sport
suit she looked like a boy and in her calm assur-
ance of every movement as she read the instru-
ments as she indicated that she understood every
technical feature she was a splendid assistant
moreover the energy and self-control which she
had inherited from her father had kept her from
hesitating a second at the moment of ascent

  the cabin was exactly like the one in the first
rocket except that irene had quietly put up a cur-
tain to divide the room at night

  during the whole first day as well as during
the two nights neither of them had perceived
anything that could serve them as a goal

  to-day i shall go out of the rocket and look
about in the open by now we must be about far
enough for us to be able to determine whether
egons rocket is within our path

  irene replied perfectly calmly naturally i
am coming too

  they were speaking as though it were simply a
question of ascending the upper deck of a ship
yet it was neither more nor less than venturing a
step into infinite space

  during the night apel had let down the metal
shields before the windows they had to sleep
after all

  now he pressed a button and the metal shield
moved away in the same instant there poured
in such dazzling sunlight that they were nearly
blinded and had to darken the window again at
once

  let us try the other side

  irene worked the lever the metal shield moved
back and their eyes were dazzled by an almost
stronger sunbeam which most remarkably did
not seem to come from above but from right close
at hand they had to darken this window also
it is incredible

  we seem to be between two suns

  could it be a meteor

  apel had brought out two pairs of sun-glasses
they protected their eyes with these and tried
once more

  the position of the rocket had meanwhile
changed a little the oblique rays no longer
struck the window exactly for a moment apel
looked and then he became evidently excited

  come here and look for yourself do you know
what that is

  it is a single glowing point

  look closely

  it is a single glowing point

  his face had a triumphant look dont you
really guess i am convinced that egons rocket
is very nearby

  mr apel

  the engineer had not taken his telescope from
his eye
between earth and moon	

  that is no star that is no meteor that is not
even a comet

  he laughed contentedly those are mirrors
that is the large net with the mirror-facets which
egon had with him

  you really believe so

  he spread it out and made signals with ii
  then you believe that the other rocket-

 the old man nodded very probably now
i am going out

  and i too

  not yet i am just going out into the air-lock
now we must see which way we have to steer
with youthful speed apel who was already
dressed in the artificial skin slipped on his oxygen
helmet skillfully irene made the fastenings and
closed the tube and fastened the thin leather rope
to apels belt

  you take your helmet also enter the opening
of the air-lock and hold the rope if i raise my
right hand pull me back

  in spite of her steady nerves irene had a mo-
ment of fearful dismay when she stood in the
projecting air-lock swaying in its light spring-
framework while right at her feet she could look
down into the infinite abyss of space

  apel too stood for a moment in hesitation he
also was to make the first conversion of theory
to practice he did not know that egon had al-
ready done this at this moment he trembled not
with fear for himself but at the thought of what
would happen to irene if he did not find his way
back

  meanwhile he had given an imperceptible pres-
sure to a lever he had already thought out an
improvement a little oxygen cylinder was fas-
tened to his belt pointing backward and the pres-
sure of a lever opened the valve while his will
still hesitated he felt that his feet had already
left the rocket as he now without feeling heat
or cold floated freely in space it seemed to him as
though a truly divine sensation were pervading
his body and as though he had found the highest
fulfillment of his dreams

  he looked about now he was fairly close to
the net it was floating in space fully outspread
but there was nothing to be seen of the rocket
his telescope scanned the heavens suddenly some-
thing whisked by overhead at a tremendous speed

  it passed like a flash of lightning many thou-
sand meters above him

  apel raised his right arm and had irene draw
him back already the mirror-net lay far below
them

an explanation

they were again in the cabin before a word
was spoken apel worked the levers

  what is it

  irene saw how he was turning the gyroscopic
controls

  we must go back a little way first we must
fold up the net and get it into the rocket we
must not make willful oversights and we do not
know whether the mirrors indicate good fortune
or bad

  have you seen the rocket-

  at least i know where it is

 you know

  one thing at a time first we must stow away
the mirrors

  it was astonishing how readily the rocket obey-
ed the controls how excellently the exhausts
worked which were alternately shut off and again
started in a short time they were close by the
net apel who now moved about outside with
perfect confidence got the net alongside where
they folded it up and pulled it into the rocket
then apel closed the air-lock again from the in-
side and rubbed his hands contentedly while he
again worked the controls and at the same time
switched on the exhausts

  why do you torment methis way

  there is still time for explanation look out
of the window

  irene looked out and gazed at the disk of the
earth

  you have turned we are no longer ascend-
ing

  no

  the earth is no longer behind us but below us
  of course

  are you going to return

  there was anxiety in her eyes and she was
vexed by the smile on apels face

  in that case i would turn the bow of the rocket
toward the earth

  but what are you doing

  as you correctly guess we are encircling the
earth

  do you think you will find the rocket here
just sit down calmly and i will tell you i
have seen the rocket probably sixty thousand
meters or a couple more or less above us

  and then arent we to ascend any more

  i will explain to you egons rocket has ap-
parently lost the power of independent motion
probably the fuel is exhausted for some reason
which i naturally do not know egons rocket has
tangential ly converged on the orbit of the earth
at a very high speed becoming as it were a new
though tiny moon and now it is encircling the
earth at an extraordinary velocity

  but then- began irene with an expression
of horror

  then nothing is lost we must just manage
to secure for ourselves by using our rocket motor
and the abundant fuel we still have as nearly as
possible the same velocity and at the same time
slowly rise upward of course we must cautious
ly avoid having our orbits meet prematurely
now irene began to understand she saw how
the velocity meter rose from minute to minute
as they encircled the earth faster and faster

  egon and korus were again awake in the cabin
egon very much exhausted and dull while korus
had a splitting headache

  the american lay unconscious on the floor
the cabin was again warmed but therewith the
last battery had been exhausted they un-
wrapped from all right the covers and protec-
tions and put him to bed on investigating his
wound they found it broken out and very bad
	wonder stories quarterly

indeed to judge from appearances he recovered
consciousness and groaned in pain

 egon and korus pressed his hand now you
 have saved both of us

 while his pains slowly lessened with the appli-
 cation of healing substances the american
 smiled

 we have no reproaches or thanks to give one
 another we have all done the same thing first
 the doctor then korus and lastly i

and now

 they sat together in silence korus had opened
 the last champagne bottle

 we must refresh ourselves

 they all three felt that they had reached the
 end of their strength korus repeated what
 now

 egon replied almost angrily wait of course
 to see whether the signals were seen

 and if they were seen

 wait to see whether apel sends up the second
 rocket

 pitilessly the american continued asking and
 if he does

 wait to see whether they find us

 that is wait and wait while we slowly lose
 our reason

 again there began to be a flash in his eyes
 korus too was evidently excited as for egon
 he felt most inclined to scream loudly

 we will drink wine and go to sleep

 they emptied the last bottles and alcohol as
 well as exhaustion put them to sleep

the signs of rescue

apels rocket sped ever faster about the
earth making ever wider circles now irene
stood at the window twelve more hours had
passed but neither of them had been able to close
their eyes

 mr apel look up there

 not at all far above them though still of course
 more than a thousand meters the other rocket
 was just speeding past even now it was going
 much faster than they but one could very plainly
 make out the form of the rocket

 irene wept loudly apel opened the exhausts
 still more widely the velocity meter trembled
 and shook and could hardly keep on registering

 egon was the first to awake he rose stepped
 to the little round window and gazed out

 he reflected the oxygen which they had was
 again almost exhausted the edible provisions
 were practically at an end for much was spoiled
 they could cook no longer the electric current
 was used up

 if help did not come in a few hours all was
 lost

 his face had a set expression whence should
 help come now korus stood beside him while
 the american still slept

 korus you are a man

 i know what you are going to say to me it
 is all over

 very probably pull yourself together

  i am composed that was just a momentary
feeling

  we will not say anything to the american 
should not care to have an ugly scene in the last
moment give him some morphine so that he will
remain asleep we will finish our notes in case
the remains of our rocket should some time come
to earth again then-then we will simply open
the windows-removing the metal shield from the
broken one and breaking the other the chill of
space will quickly and painlessly release us from
our sufferings

  korus made no reply but neither did he show
any outbreak of unmanly weakness

  he stepped to the window and looked out what
egon just now said was no surprise to him yet-
he was young

  there was perfect stillness in the cabin egon
was carefully arranging the writing material for
putting down the last notes

  suddenly korus gave a loud cry it was so
loud that the american started up from his mor-
phine sleep egon could not help thinking that
it was a case of the insanity of the two young
journalists

  doctor doctor come here look

  he shrieked and at the same time sobbed
aloud egon jumped to the window looked out
and cried just as loudly the rocket great god
in heaven the second rocket

  all right straightened up what rocket
  the rocket bringing aid do you hear

  is that true

  the tears ran down koruss cheeks cant
you see by looking at us that it is true

  the two stood at the window and looked out
as the second rocket slowly neared them

  they in no wise felt that in reality the two
rockets were speeding along at an incredible vel-
ocity

the meeting

four more days had passed on the earth with-
out anything being learned about the rockets
then happened a sensational thing which ex-
cited the entire world again an article by the
director of the chicago observatory was sent to
the newspapers

     the solution of the rocket mystery it can
   no longer be denied that very small bodies are
   encircling the earth in a very rapid motion it
   has not been possible as yet to make an exact cal-
   culation of their distance from our planet but
   they cannot be very far beyond the limit of the
   atmosphere i think it extremely probable that
   these are the two space rockets

      by some as yet insufficiently explained natural
   law or by some fault in their construction both
   of them the first and afterward the second have
   been forced to encircle the earth

      thereby it is certainly proved that it is possible
   to fly with rockets into space but that it is not
   possible to return again to the earth unfortun-
   ately this seals the fate of the five bold persons
   who have undertaken the hazardous flight
between earth and moon	

 there was no one who would have dared to
contradict these calm and concrete words yet
after a few days came a new message of sadness
a japanese steamer en route to frisco saw on
the high seas a strange object floating along
they lowered a boat and got on board half of a
rocket ship with the cabin still entirely intact
a few hours later the steamer was in frisco

  again there was a violent conflict of opinions

  joe allister was close to madness it was
one of the two rockets but which one

  there was nobody in it where were the pas-
sengers

  the following evening a reporter who was
again carefully searching the entire wreck found
in a corner a note which was entirely soaked
through the writing had become illegible and
nothing could be made out but the signature
irene

  this same evening it was necessary to take joe
allister to a sanitarium he had completely
broken down

  it was the first rocket the remains of which
had been fished out of the sea

side by side

the second rocket had attained the velocity
of the first separated by about fifty meters
they were now rushing side by side around the
earth apel could not leave the controls for an
instant even a single millimeter of wrong dev-
iation in course at such a velocity would have in-
evitably caused in the next second a collision or
a parting of their paths

  irene in her diving suit stood in the outer door
of the air-lock

  yonder in the same fashion stood egon to
be sure in their equipment neither could recog-
nize the other they only knew that over there
stood a person desiring help and over here a per-
son who wanted to bring help with fifty meters
of infinite abyss lying between them

  irene had wanted to make the attempt of fly-
ing across by means of the little oxygen cylinder
apel had forbidden her it was uncertain what
currents might be caused by the two rockets trav-
elling close together

  in the last few hours as long as the distance
was still greater and apel was still able to en-
trust the steering to irene he had been working
in the cabin now both his helmet and hers were
provided with little telephones and there was a
wire between the two

  they wore their diving suits and since they
had sufficient electric power to warm the cabin
again later the doors stood open irene was serv
ing as it were as the captain and apel as the
navigation officer at the controls

  still fifty meters

  there was a slight pressure below

  still twenty-five

  their hearts beat the two faces at the win-
dow of egons cabin were distorted with anxiety

  ten meters

  a last imperceptible impulse

  apel had steered in masterly fashion the

two rockets were close together egon took the
leather rope from irenes hand apel had shut
off all the power perfectly evenly as demanded
by the laws of nature the two rockets shot
through space now fastened together fore and
aft as a single body

  at this moment irene allisters strength gave
out and she collapsed

  waldemar apel had achieved the most brill-
iant success his controls had worked like in-
struments of precision and the rocket motor had
outdone itself

  he himself felt as fresh as a boy egon and
korus had forgotten all their troubles the
american had been wrapped in a great piece of
the artificial skin which apel had on board fof
making replacement clothing in case of need and
brought into the second cabin

  apel examined egons rocket

  it is a miracle that it was not completely de-
stroyed a miracle that it brought you thus far

  everything was put into the second rocket
since all were again supplied by apel with oxy-
gen helmets and the american was covered by the
artificial skin they had drawn the two rockets
close together and opened the windows to be
able to pass everything across

  then the second rocket was closed up again
the electric heat turned on and oxygen admitted

  now at length the diving helmets could be re-
moved again thus far egon had hardly noticed
apels young assistant but now he thought he
was seeing a ghost

  irene allister

  with a smile she held out both her hands to
him i had to fetch you down again doctor my
father and i were to blame for your flight

  she attempted to smile but she did not succeed
well he sought the strength to hide his feelings
at this moment apel gave him a bit of help in
this

  the old man embraced egon with both arms
my boy my dear boy

  korus lay on his knees beside the american
the two men embraced each other and then they
kissed egon and apel at length they all em-
braced one another weeping and laughing and
in the narrow cabin five hearts that had been
despairing waiting and hoping gave vent to
great joy

  they grew calmer only slowly irene allister
stood at one side rather embarrassed all had
embraced her too but she only knew that she had
kissed egon

  waldemar apel sought to turn their thoughts
into other channels he said with a smile i
do not know whether you are insistent on en-
circling the earth any longer as a satellite

  a bit of terror disturbed the general joy

  how can we prevent it

  apel laughed i think it will not be hard
you were unable because you had no more power
of your own we will combine the two leather
ropes which we have into one to take in tow the
wreck of the first rocket which we do not want
	wonder stories quarterly

to abandon up here then we will start the rock-
et motor again and return to the earth
hitherto egon had been the one whom the
others trusted unreservedly but now this old
man with the strength and eyes of a young man
spoke so naturally of quite incredible things that
even egon yielded to him and forgot all doubts
all right then

  not yet if you please gentlemen i and my
assistant have not left our posts for twenty-four
hours first we will eat and rest let the earth
have its second moon for eight hours more
they ate and drank what irene prepared on
the electric plate it was a joyous meal then
they all went fast asleep

  toward morning waldemar apel awoke while
the rest still slept very silently he worked on
the leather ropes then he opened the exhaust-
levers and started the ignition the sleepers
started up a shock had awakened them

  what is it

  look out into the open

  close before them lay the yellow gleaming
disk of the earth the bow of the rocket was
directed straight toward it far behind them
on the long leather rope the wreck of the first
rocket was following the second

  apel laughed we have left the orbital path
egon said in a solemn tone we are returning
to the earth

chapter xiv

coming closer

this time it was the lick observatory that
first gave the alarming news the orbit is
becoming narrower and narrower it seems to
be the space rocket which is approaching the
earth

  all the observatories were working feverishly
all the newspapers were in readiness all the
radio stations were on duty night and day

  almost every hour there came a new report
which was as startling as the explosion of a
bomb

  the space rocket

   it is coming closer

   but it is not sinking straight down it is still
encircling the earth at high speed only the circles
become narrower each time

  there were conflicting views hostile and
friendly

   it is making a flight to get publicity

   it is going to profit by its success

   on the contrary its pilot is clever the rocket
has no wings and only the energy of the swift
flight can soften the shock on landing

  where will it land

  when will it finally reach the earth

  by now it could already be plainly recognized
through a telescope it was still travelling at a
terrific speed it was making the circuit of the
earth in two hours still at a greater height
than had ever been attained by an airship
probably it will land in san francisco bay
quite right the rocket belongs to joe allis-
ter

  a day earlier nobody had believed in the re-
turn of the rocket now there was hardly any-
one who doubted that the rocket could land ex-
actly where its pilot desired

  there was only one single person who did not
show the least interest joe allister

  since he was convinced of the death of his
daughter he took no more interest in the rocket
quite the contrary he had returned to his
home but he had shut himself in he did not
want to see or hear anything

  waldemar apel and egon stood together at
the window slowly the rocket was nearing the
earth it was going its way with mathematical
exactness

  a day passed the velocity meter mounted
we must be careful we are already at the
complete mercy of the earths gravity we must
not fall

  the second rocket in tow is making the con-
trol hard for us

  apel reflected we will wait until we are
near the ocean between san francisco and the
hawaiian islands then we will cut the cable
the other rocket following the force of gravity
will go down the ocean is very deep there it
will come up again i think and remain floating
thub we shall send the earth our first greeting
while we ourselves descend in very slow circles
egon you guided the ascent to the moon you
may now take the controls again i hope that we
shall land in the harbor of frisco

  he said this with a contented smile and no
one now doubted their success

  irene wrote a few lines quickly

  my dear father we are coming we are
all together apel the doctor the two reporters
and i we shall land according to apel in three
days that is sunday forenoon in the harbor of
frisco your irene

  egon once more put on the oxygen helmet en-
tered the other rocket and laid the note on the
floor he carefully closed all the containers se-
cured the air-lock from the outside and regained
the second rocket by means of the rope

  he had a sorrowful feeling not only he but
the three men felt sad when the wreck now
changed its course descending faster and faster
while they themselves went on in their circles
this faithful wreck to which they owed their
lives which had held out so wonderfully they
were now probably giving over to destruction

  apel laughed egon i think you are getting
sentimental again

  but the wreck was not destroyed it was
fished out of the water only the waves that had
got in had effaced the writing of irenes note all
except the signature

they are coming

sunday morning in san francisco the
rocket had been encircling the earth in ever
narrower course this morning it was changing
its path no longer going about the earth but
making lightning-like ever smaller circuits over
america and the pacific ever smaller and
smaller
between earth and moon	

  there is no doubt they will land in the har-
bor of frisco

  they will land in a few hours

  there were thousands of airplanes and dirig-
ibles over the land extra trains were bringing
hundreds of thousands by railway across the
country autos and motorcycles were speeding
along all the highways over night san fran-
cisco had suddenly become the most populous city
on earth

  the american navy was keeping the harbor
barred hundreds of ships decked with flags
lay at the shores with steam up ready to start

  the harbor the whole city-no all america
and the entire world were decorated with ameri-
can and german flags the american flags were
for joe allister the german for egon

  no radio station broadcast anything but the
news of the space rocket

  orders were given no airship may ascend
or remain up

  everyone understood expectancy became
great

  the airships might no longer ascend test they
get in the current of air of the rocket

  there was a cry a cry from millions of throats

  for the first time they saw the rocket with the
naked eye as it swept through its wide circles at
lightning speed

  people shouted and screamed they threw
their arms about one another women became
hysterical the whistles of the ships sounded

  joe allister stood in his room he wanted to
see nothing and hear nothing intentionally he
was dressed in his bathrobe the loudspeaker
of the radio kept screaming him news in spite
of him

  they are coming-

  the lick observatory had plainly made out
the american and german flags on board they
were not at half mast apparently everything
was all right

  now the rocket was floating fairly low still at
a high speed

  the noise the frenzy of enthusiasm all in-
creased from second to second the door of the
allister house was pulled open out rushed joe
allister in dressing gown and slippers without a
hat he leaped into a passing auto and panted
to the harbor

  somebody stood by the chauffeur and shouted
to the crowd make room for joe allister
hurrah for joe allister

  three cheers for joe allister

  the street opened the crowd made way for
him they ran along after him shouting there
was a triumphal procession down to the harborj
he was showered with bouquets

  all san francisco cried his name but he heardl
nothing reaching the shore he jumped into the
white yacht

  full steam ahead

  nobody prevented him he alone was allowed
to go at this moment when the white yacht

left the shore while the old man clung to the rail
on the bridge it happened

  there was a roar and whistle over the heads
of the millions on the shore

  then the metal bird went over the houses very
low

  it was in the harbor and then-

  millions held their breath the space rocket
suddenly stopped right over the middle of the
harbor it went down vertically fell into the
water went under rose again and floated

  at the same instant the entire sky was black
with airplanes and airships of all kinds

  hundreds of ships whistled their jubilation
cannons were fired fireworks were sent up
right in broad day the warships all gaily
decked with flags formed a circle about the
rocket

flattering offers

a boat left the white yacht in it was joe
allister as pale as death he reached the
rocket there a door opened and there was a
cheer from the thousands who were on the war-
ships

  hurrah for irene allister

  the head of a girl with black hair and shining
eyes had appeared in the opening a slim young
figure was gracefully climbing on to the roof of
the floating rocket-

  at this moment joe allister wept aloud
  hurrah for egon helmstatter

  hurrah for all right

  hurrah for kurt korus

  last of all as though he wished to give the
glory to the others an old man came out of the
rocket

  hurrah for waldemar apel

  the five travellers of space were on board the
white yacht while the warships carefully raised
the rocket out of the water and took it in safe
keeping on board the admirals ship

  a single cry went over the entire earth it
was conveyed on invisible waves by radio

  the space rocket is here

  one rocket brought help to the other in
space

  the first people are back from the moon

  the white yacht reached the shore soldiers
had to shut off the streets six persons who had
as yet hardly exchanged a word sat in joe allis-
ters car an open car they were all looking at
the old man who knew nothing and understood
nothing except that his only child was sitting be-
side him and holding her arms about him

  the screams and shouts became louder the
soldiers were helpless the auto was surrounded
it could not proceed and had to stop there in
jubilation joe allister and the five space travel-
lers were carried to the allister house on the
shoulders of the crowd

  outside the crowd swayed back and forth on
this day the entire world had only six names on
its lips six names before which all the glory of
other persons grew dim

a sudden shaft of yellowish luminesence plunges into our midst-these devastating beams are hurt-
ling along in ever-increasing numbers


an atomic adventure

my first impressions were decidedly vague
and confused i felt as if i were emerg-
ing from an infinite sleep as i feebly
struggled back into consciousness my initial
sensation was one of steady monotonous sway-
ing-to and fro-to and fro-with a ceaseless
and uniform rhythm i was aware of nothing
else except a peculiar cramped feeling as if i
had been fixed in an awkward position for ages
and ages

  at first i could perceive nothing about me
i seemed to be plunged in an in-
terminable sea of blackness

however as my benumbed con-
sciousness returned i became
aware of a strange confusion
of lights slowly painfully
they assumed shapes and mag-
nitude gradually i began to
discern a certain order and reg-
ularity about these luminous
bodies above below and on
all sides of me they circled and
twisted trailing after each other
in rotating strings of light

their pale yellow luminescence
as they cavorted all about me
cast a grotesque glow over the
entire scene i watched in
breathless fascination the end-
less rotations of these spheres
of light some-
where back in
the dim re-
cesses of my
mind i experi-
enced a hazy
recol lectio n
that this scene
was not new to
me i had a
queer sensation
that i had
taken part in a
strikingly simi-
lar episode be-
fore not once
but many many
times in the
period of my
existence and
yet it all ap-
peared so new
so strange so
unutterably bi-
zarre 

  suddenly i became conscious of a peculiar
phenomenon amid all the circling and swing-
ing of countless globes of light i perceived that
a number of them larger and evidently much
closer than the rest were rotating about me-
for a moment i was seized with an uncontrolla-
ble impulse to flee but even in the semi-con-
scious and befogged condition in which i still
felt myself i realized that i had no means of
escape the only movement of which i found
myself capable was the inexorable rhythmatic
vibration that had ushered me out of the sleep

 william lemkin ph d

of ages into the first feeble state of wakefulness

  with awe and fascination i watched the gyrat-
ing bodies of light-my bodies of light i re-
flected with almost a sense of pride i lost all
thought of the myriads of other luminous
spheres that danced and played in flashing
circles of concentric light all about me round
and round my satellites raced-and i soon per-
ceived that there were in all six of them that
swung around me as their centre two of these
shining balls chased each other around in a
circle of their own a short
distance from me beyond those
i counted four others rotating
rapidly in a circle of somewhat
larger diameter - all equally
spaced and tagging after each
other in a dizzy whirl after
my first sensation of alarm and
anxiety had passed away i con-
tinued to observe with mounting
admiration this smooth and
ceaseless circling where was
i what were these strange
lights why did they gyrate
in this fascinating hypnotic
manner somehow i could not
live down the feeling that this
was all a perfectly natural state
of affairs that i belonged here
that i had always been here-
and that i



would continue
to remain here
for eons to
come

  presently i
turned my at-
tention to mat-
ters outside the
little sphere of
activity of
which i was the
centre in all
that seeming
chaos of lights
that extended
in all directions
beyond my own
private circle i
began to make
out some sem-
blance of order
and regularity
i perceived with
great elation
that i was not alone in the semi-gloom that
blanketed this strange scene like a dark mantle
i saw that there were many other entities like
myself all swinging through space to and fro
with that same rhythmic oscillation that char-
acterized my own motions and out of that
bewildering confusion of pale lights i soon ob-
served that each of these beings like myself
was the centre of rapid rotation of luminous
bodies in every case as far as i could see in
all directions about me each one of them pos-
sessed six glowing spheres two in an inner

 there are many people who say that with the growing
 complexity of our machines the machines are acquir-
 ing an intelligence or even a soul tho this is perhaps
 a far-fetched statement yet one who watches the operation
 of a complex machine which performs a number of delicate
 motions with super-human precision cannot help but feel
 that the machine has a personality of some kind

   suppose a machine could think what then would be its
 reactions to the world about it they would perhaps be in-
 tensely interesting to us and very instructive or suppose
 matter in general possessed consciousness and was aware
 of the experiences that it suffered in passing thru its vari-
 ous forms under the hand of man what would it have to say
 to us these are all subjects full of dramatic possibilities
 and our author has taken one of them to construct one of
 the most entertaining instructive and yet exciting stories
 we have yet told
	wonder stories quarterly

circle and four in an outer circle concentric with
the first

  and then i saw that we were all lined up in
rows and columns and tiers each following this
regular periodic vibration with no tangible
means of support and yet held in our relative
positions as by invisible bonds of some elastic
substance what a beautiful scheme i mar-
veled here indeed was a uniformity of arrange-
ment and a regularity of activity that surely
was more than a mere accident or coincidence
obviously in this marvelously intricate mechan-
ism in which i found myself there existed some
salient purpose for my presence as well as the
presence of this vast assemblage of my fellow-
beings whose lot i had come to regard as simi-
lar to my own

bewilderment

my revery was abruptly terminated by a
rough exclamation from my left

  say you over there cant you iook where
you vibrate your no  electron came darn
close to knocking my no  out of its orbit
why dont you learn how to control your proton
attractions a little better watching you some-
body would think you never directed an outer-
shell electron in your entire existence after
being a carbon atom all your life it seems to me
you ought to have acquired a little skill in hand-
ling the job

  electron-vroton-outershell-carbon atom
-these words burned into my consciousness
i was left gasping and bewildered somewhere
i recalled having heard them before at some
time in my existence i felt they had been com-
mon expressions in my every-day language but
now they rang strange and hollow

  slowly and laboriously i turned in my vibra-
tory path so as to ascertain whence the complaint
originated i perceived that my immediate
neighbor to the left was showing signs of ex-
treme agitation he swung to and fro with an
aminous hiss which he managed to make doubly
threatening whenever our oscillations brought
us closer together even his satellitic bodies of
light glowed with a brighter sheen and whirled
with increased celerity in their double circles

  i looked about timidly to see if my other neigh-
bors around me had taken cognizance of the
situation apparently none of them was aware
of anything unusual or else if they had heard
the raucous protest they showed no signs of it
to us again i turned to my belligerent fellow
and managed to stammer

  really sir i-i-im awfully sorry that i came
so near to you you see i-that is-if you-
what i mean to say-i-i dont quite understand
w-w-what this is all about

  i could perceive that my idiotic gibberish was
not making things any better between us my
neighbor continued his threatening swings ac-
companied by that bellicose hissing

  dont understand it he ejaculated derisive-
ly why you blooming moron you act as
though you were born yesterday havent you
been vibrating there as a carbon atom for the
last  electronic age-cycles

  my confusion increased i was more befud-
dled than ever by these strange terms and ideas
-strange and yet touching faintly some respon-
dent chord in the dim recesses of ny memory

  honestly sir i managed to blurt out it
may sound totally incredible to you but i dont
know who or what i am where i came from or
why i am here everything about me is new and
bewildering-but i seem to have a hazy recollec-
tion of having been here before my courage
mounted as i continued you speak sir of
things that carry to me only the vaguest memo-
ries i have been asleep-unconscious-yes dead
for a long long period of time whatever i
knew of my position and duties in this vast or-
ganization i have forgotten my former knowl-
edge and impressions whatever they were have
been completely effaced nothing remains with
me but the most nebulous film of associations
everything about me now is inexplicable-unin-
telligible i feel as though i have emerged
from a stupor of ages -i-i-

  my warlike neighbor regarded me suspiciously
and i halted in my earnest pleadings

  you dont believe me i exclaimed implor-
ingly you think that im reciting a fairy tale
dont you oh please sir-please-

  humph- he growled it does listen like a
pretty cock-and-bull story

  i could almost feel his burning scrutiny pene-
trate my being like a searing flame how long
do you say youve been in this-this uncon-
scious condition

  truly sir i dont know nor am i aware of
how or why i ever entered that state

  well now let me see he mused and i
shuddered in anticipation of his words some-
how it seems to me that you have been acting
sort of queer as long as i have known you-and
goodness knows thats a mighty long time
never seemed to take much interest in the rest
of us atoms all around you-always moping
around by yourself as if you were too high-
class-or else just plain dumb

  i winced at the gross accusations but i dared
not reply my far-fetched tale was evidently
beginning to appear more reasonable

  during the entire period that we carbon
atoms have been thrown together he continued
reflectively and thats somewhere in the vicini-
ty of  electronic age-cycles-you didnt as
much as give us your closest neighbors a single
nod or a gesture of recognition we just put
you down as hopeless and paid no attention to
your fool presence

 unconscious you say mm-thats the
first time ive ever heard of a carbon atom or
any other atom for that matter getting into
such a condition before the only way i can ex-
plain it is that you suffered some queer twist
during the last condensation-some unheard of
strain or internal warping that knocked you out
for all those ages of time as far as i know
theres no record of any similar accident and
yet-there doesnt seem to be any good reason
why such a state is not possible in this marvel-
ous existence of which we are only a minute
an atomic

speck can someone say that anything is im-
possible

  i was immensely bolstered by the changed at-
titude of my erstwhile antagonist things were
certainly coming my way i reflected joyously
and now was the time to clear up in my mind
those vague impressions and mystifying phe-
nomena of which i found myself so suddenly a
part

  i am very anxious to learn mr-er-mr-
cx--j is my atomic designation in our
present environment if you care to know yours
its cx--j and for pitys sake please cut
out that mister just call me cx--that will be
sufficient to identify me around these parts
very well cx- and thank you i am very
anxious to get some information regarding this
strange world all about me you have dropped
a few ideas in your remarks that are practically
meaningless to me can you please tell me what
this whole thing means

  my evident eagerness and sincerity had soft-
ened him considerably and he was not at all
averse to discussing the matter with me in great
detail

  well it is very obvious began cx- that
the strange twist or whatever force it may have
been that was exerted on your anatomy must
have had a radical effect on your memory if you
cant recall anything more than the vaguest im-
pressions from your past existence

  in the first place you must bear in mind that
you are a carbon atom a minute speck of mat-
ter similar in appearance and properties to
countless billions of other carbon atoms you
have your central portion or nucleus consisting
of positive charges of electricity called protons
together with a number of much larger particles
of negative electricity called electrons your
nucleus however always has an excess of six
positive charges outside your nucleus is the
field consisting of six electrons revolving in two
shells or orbits with a total of six negative
charges these balance the excess positive
charges in your nucleus so that you are as a
whole electrically neutral almost all your
weight is concentrated in the nucleus which is
several hundred times as heavy as an orbital
electron

twas fascinated at the revelation of how com-
plex my internal structure really was i
glanced at my six satellites of light dancing in
swift circles about me and marveled at the
beauty of the arrangement i peered about me
at the spinning electrons of my neighbors won-
dering what superior intelligence had devised
this intricate mechanism and was regulating its
smooth operation-
but we carbon atoms are not the only mem-
bers of this great universe of ours continued
my neighbor i have heard it said by those
whose knowledge cannot be questioned that there
are in all ninety-two different kinds of atoms
some very abundant and others of extreme rari-

adventure	

ty as yet i have met less than half of them
but i expect to come in contact with most of
them before im through

  ninety-two i echoed and how are the
other ninety-one distinguished from our own
carbon atoms

  easily enough laughed cx all the
atoms are made up of the same substance or
material if you wish to call it that it is
electricity and ali atoms are distinguished
from each other by the number of electrons that
revolve in the external field which in turn is
determined by the number of excess protons
in the nucleus

  now you take the simplest atom of all-the
hydrogen atom it has one excess proton and
on revolving electron you cannot conceive of
any structure that is more elementary than that
it is the lightweight of all the atoms-a sort
of dainty fairy queen that flits about with the
utmost ease and grace perhaps ill be able to
point out some of these atoms to you soon im
sure youll enjoy meeting them on the other
hand you take our heaviest atom uranium the
super-heavyweight among us it has no less
than ninety-two electrons all revolving about
the nucleus in eight distinct rings there are
two electrons in the first ring of the electronic
field eight in each of the second and third
eighteen in each of the fourth fifth sixth and
seventh and two in the eighth ring just imagine
the complexity of such a ponderous atom

  i could hardly grasp the full import of  his
description such a vast mechanism of elec-
tronic motion was far beyond my feeble powers
of comprehension

  but just one point cx- i interrupted
all about us i see nothing but our own kind-
hundreds of carbon atoms at least i take
them all for our kind because i can count their
electrons and each has six revolving about the
nucleus in two rings where are all those other
kinds of atoms that you tell about where
have you met them and how will i ever have
the opportunity of seeing them

  ah my friend laughed we carbon atoms
are grouped together here in a sort of exclusive
society we form a part of what is known as
coal-do you have any recollection of the name
-coal

  my expression was one of complete blankness
and he continued

  well my dear cx- you have much-very
much to relearn after your long lapse of memo-
ry we members of the carbon family-you
among us of course-have lain here for count-
less ages once yes many times we were united
with other atoms of all kinds to form complex
structures these groupings are called mole-
cules some of them consist of only two atoms
frequently there are several hundred joined to-
gether in a most elaborate pattern to form a
single molecule

  but our associations have melted we have
lost our accompanying atoms they have gone
to seek other unions and here we are closely
packed and patiently waiting for the time when
we are delivered into a more active existence
	wonder stories quarterly

  prisoners i gasped-confined here to per-
petual solitude

  no no was my friends reassuring com-
ment dont put it that way we are merely
held here temporarily the period of our de-
tention in this place is only a fleeting instant
compared to the total extent of our existence
only an instant i expostulated why you
told me a little while ago that we have been in
this same spot for -what was it-electronic
age-cycles

  true enough but do you know how old you
and i and all of us are there is no record of
when we and the other ninety-one atoms came
into existence we have always been here al-
ways and how long do we expect to live
forever-yes forever ah my dear cx- you
look puzzled-my tale sounds as far-fetched as
yours did to me at first but weird as it seems
it is truth itself the atoms that make up all
matter can neither be created nor destroyed
eternal change

i could think of nothing appropriate to say
in order to express adequately my conflict of
ideas and emotions so my neighbor went on
far far above us there exists another world
-a world of brilliant light and gorgeous colors
-a world of life and contrast that realm is
far different from this cramped and gloomy
existence in which you and i now find ourselves
and in that world located above us there lives
a race of beings tremendous in their size and
powerful in their strength and capabilities each
member of this mighty tribe is nothing but a
vast bundle of atoms-all kinds and varieties-
knit together in a most elaborate pattern but
the central figure in this intricate network is the
carbon atom such as you and i and all our
fellows about us here we hold the supreme
position in its make-up without us life itself
would be impossible for this huge race

  and what is the name of this clan i asked
eagerly this tribe that lives far above us and
depends for its very existence on us alone
man was the reply the human race
each individual is a remarkably complicated or-
ganism and endowed with phenomenal power
principally because he has a complex central
station that organizesdirects and motivates the
rest of the mechanism this central station he
calls his brain

  tell me more cx- i begged about things
in this marvelous world that is located far above
us are there any other organized beings that
exist there

  many others he replied thousands of dif-
ferent varieties of all shapes and sizes they
are constructed on the same principle as man
but are far less complex in their make-up he
has classified them all into groups and divisions
such as bacteria insects plants birds reptiles
and mammals each consists of millions of
atoms like ourselves hooked up with millions
of other atoms from the ninety-one varieties
that exist and the entire structure is organized
and coordinated to the minutest detail yet all
of these beings are inferior to man because of

his elaborately constituted central station-his
brain

  i was anxious to learn how my friend knew so
much concerning that distant and intricate
world that lay above us all and i questioned
him eagerly about it

  all of us atoms cx- explained with a
gesture that embraced the entire circle of our
comrades around us have been there-even
you although you have no recollection of it
we have been part of the structural substances
of many human beings as well as of the other
forms of living organisms their bodily ma-
terial is constantly changing there is a con-
tinuous building up process and a breaking down
process-a constant flux and movement in
which elementary substances like ourselves are
derived from the destruction of complex organi-
zations only to be reconstructed once more into
different and more complex molecules

  i tell you cx- he continued the world
above is one mad whirl of excitement-a dizzy
but a fascinating game one is always on the
move there is always something new turning
up things never have a chance to get stale
i know youll be delighted when our time comes
to join in the activities up there

  but i queried why are we confined in this
gloomy prison down here without any chance
of participating in the lively doings of this other
world that you have described have we car-
bon atoms committed some crime for which we
have been banished to this inactive condition of
-of what do you call it-coal

  we have been here a long time was my
neighbors reply but our day will come before
long you see cx- our last combination in
the upper world was in the structure of some
plants we were closely tied up with many
other atoms principally hydrogen and oxygen
then these plants ceased to function as a unified
organism-that is they died the complex
mechanism of which we were a part fell into a
state of decay and disruption great masses of
material accumulated over us and packed us
down with a pressure that increased as time
went on our allied atoms the hydrogen and
oxygen and the others that had been joined with
us to make up the molecules of the living plants
began to loosen their ties evidently they felt
no little disgruntled at this rough treatment
perhaps they were confident that they could do
better with other associations and under dif-
ferent conditions at any rate they left us-
one by one and in small groups until we carbon
atoms are now alone or practically so here
and there throughout our society you can still
find a few of those atoms that have not been so
flighty and impatient as the rest you will ob-
serve a number of them still maintaining their
old associations with us true to their former
partners and ready to stand by us to the very
end

  my friend now proceeded to point out to me
some of these loyal atoms that had cast their
lot with the carbon clan down here in this out-
of-the-way locality true enough i had in my
first hasty inspection of the scene somehow
an atomic

overlooked certain alien beings that i could now
see were different from the rest off to one side
i made out an actively vibrating nucleus with
one shining electron pursuing a lone course
about it i had no difficulty in recognizing this
foreign member as a hydrogen atom there
were a number of them in a group and they
seemed to be joined to the adjacent carbon
atoms by some invisible bond peering about
with whetted curiosity i discovered some dist-
ance above us and to the right a collection of
atoms that appeared to have a structure not very
different from our own this new atom had two
electrons swinging around in its inner circle
but its outer shell i could make out contained
six instead of four revolving satellites on
closer inspection of the immediate vicinity i soon
became aware of a goodly number of these
scattered about in pairs and in larger groups
inquiry from my obliging friend elicited some
startling information

  these are oxygen atoms-the most abundant
atoms in this sphere of matter the oxygen
atom is a most active and powerful one-al-
ways willing and eager to effect a union with
other atoms the wise men of the human race
up above regard it as of vital importance in
their vast organization notice that it differs
from the carbon atom by only two electrons in
the field about the nucleus and that small dif-
ference is enough to make us two absolutely
dissimilar entities the leaders of thought
among men designate the oxygen atom by the
number eight which they term the atomic num-
ber it really tells how many free electrons re-
volve in the field of the atom by the same sys-
tem you and i have an atomic number of six
the hydrogen atom has an atomic number of one
the uranium atom ninety-two and so on a
perfectly simple arrangement isnt it

  and yet obvious as this classification appears
to you and me it wasnt until very recently that
those great thinkers-scientists they call them
up there-discovered the truth about our struc-
ture at first they had no idea altogether about
our individual existence they knew that a few
of us occurred in the aggregate-as carbon iron
or gold then came one of their wisest-he
was known as a chemist-and his name was
dalton he was the first to offer the notion that
all matter was composed of atoms but he
thought of an atom as a smooth round hard
portion of carbon or oxygen or any other elemen-
tary substance he had no conception at all of
the intricate complexity of the atom of late
however many advances have been made in their
study of our microcosmic realm no human be-
ing has ever seen us because they have no in-
strument that is delicate enough to search into
our relatively minute sphere in spite of this
handicap however they have succeeded in mak-
ing a fairly accurate guess at the way we atoms
are built

 i have often had the good fortune to be
present when some of their most renowned
chemists have played around with the atoms as
though they were toys ive seen thesfe wise men
building up complex structures consisting of

adventure	

hundreds of atoms-they call the process syn-
thesis these elaborate molecules artificially
created in this manner were often found to be
superior to the natural substances for the par-
ticular purposes to which these scientists put
them indeed they have even improved upon
nature devising new configurations whose prop-
erties and uses were accurately predicted even
before the substance took shape oh they are a
wonderful people this race of human beings
there is just one thing i interjected that
i dont quite understand with our existences
separated by so wide a gulf-ours being so
minutely small and theirs so enormously large
-how is it possible for you to have such de-
tailed information about their lives the work
they do and the thoughts they think

  thats easy enough laughed cx- al-
though we are so tiny in comparison to them
we have a degree of intelligence of which they
havent the remotest idea they do not regard
us as sentient thinking beings what a sur-
prise they would receive were they to learn that
our intellectual capabilities far surpass any-
thing they ever dreamed possible in us it is
true that we have as yet found no means of en-
tering into communication with them but we
can follow their work and ideas and read their
innermost thoughts with ease and some day
my dear cx- you too will acquire that experi-
ence and degree of intelligence which we all pos-
sess once you get out of here and mingle free-
ly with the other atoms of our world you will
acquire ideas and aptitudes which will place you
on a par with all the rest of us then you will
find yourself able to understand everything that
goes on in your existence the world you live
in will be an open book to you

  i thanked my friendly informant for his lucid
explanation of this elaborate and bewildering
scheme of things with great anticipation i
looked forward to the time when we should all be
liberated from this cramped dungeon then my
round of adventures would begin i thrilled at
the mere thought of the unbridled freedom and
lack of restraint that i would enjoy

chapter iii

a terrible experience

again i fell to marveling at our unusual
position in this nether region it was while
turning over and over in my mind the mass of
queer facts which i had gleaned from cx- that
i again became aware of my strange oscillatory
motion somehow after the first shock of my
reawakening i seemed to have become oblivious
to this constant to-and-fro movement which all
my comrades as well as i possessed i observed
that many of them swung back and forth in
groups particularly when joined up with some
alien atoms hastening to inquire from my
obliging friend the reason for this constant com-
motion i added another important fact to my
ever-increasing fund of information

  all matter explained cx- is in a cease-
less state of vibration each particle large or
small simple or complex possesses this oscilla-
	wonder stories quarterly

tory motion to a greater or less degree depend-
ing upon outside circumstances at times the
rate of vibration is relatively slow at others it
is so rapid as to threaten the complete disrup-
tion of the structure to the human being up
there this motion manifests itself in the form of
a sense reaction which they term heat when all
vibratory motion ceases these beings refer to
the condition as the absence of all heat-they
call it the absolute zero

  have you ever been in that state i asked
eagerly what are ones sensations when all
vibration stops

  ive been pretty close to the point they call
the absolute zero was my friends answer but
ive never had the opportunity or perhaps the
misfortune of hitting the very bottom of the
scale he laughed softly to himself you can
take my word for it that the sensations are not
at all pleasant i happened to be in a group of
molecules being experimented upon by one of
the great scientists of the human race-they
classify him as a physicist he certainly put us
through our paces in a most horrible fashion
first he crowded us together under a crushing
force until we almost cried out in our pain
then he unexpectedly released the tremendous
pressure on a few of us and we were tumbled
about in such a frightfully precipitous manner
that it was the greatest miracle we werent all
smashed up in the terrible confusion

  evidently this scientist knew just what he
was doing for he repeated the process over and
over again until he had reduced a handful of
us to a state of almost complete exhaustion we
now scarcely experienced any vibratory move-
ment at all numb almost motionless and hard-
ly aware of what was going on about us we clung
to each other grimly wondering when the next
instant would be our last but even though i
felt myself drifting along in a hazy semi-con-
scious state seemingly hanging on the very brink
of an imminent and awful oblivion my courage
was bolstered by one singly thought matter is
indestructible atoms cannot be created nor
wiped out of existence the most fundamental
precept of these wise men of the human race is
the law of conservation of matter atoms can
be united in groups or the partnerships dissolved
new and complex molecules may be erected and
subsequently broken up but when we get down
to the very bottom of things there is a certain
sum total of matter in the universe which has
always been the same and will always remain
the same-even to eternity

  i clung to this idea with a dogged tenacity
even when our prospects of ever coming out alive
from this fix were dimmest and presently
things took a turn for the better apparently the
scientist was finished with his experiment-per-
haps he found himself unable to get the desired
results-we never knew what the determining
factor was at any rate our tiny group of be-
numbed particles suddenly began to experience
the glow of life returning we commenced our
oscillations once more slowly and painfully at
first but with increased vigor as we found our
strength returning soon we were vibrating as

cheerfully as ever again none the worst for our
harrowing experiences-with perhaps the ex-
ception of a haunting memory

new activity

  down here in our coal kingdom the carbon
atoms had a system of time measurement
that was based on the rotation of the electrons
about the nucleus it was a rather involved sys-
tem and i will frankly confess that i never truly
mastered its intricacies however one thing i
came to know very definitely-that an electron-
ic age-cycle was an exceedingly long stretch of
time

  as these recurring cycles succeeded each
other i became more familiar with my surround-
ings and more intimate with my immediate
neighbors they were all willing to answer any
questions that i might want to ask regarding
some point in our strange existence about which
i was unfamiliar often they told me of things
and happenings in the outside world of activity
that supplemented and enlarged the mass of
knowledge that i had derived from my first con-
versations with cx- but he always remained
my closest and dearest comrade to him i al-
ways turned with my most perplexing questions
for i was certain of obtaining fullest explana-
tions his travels had been varied and adventur-
ious his supply of facts was enormous-well-
night limitless

  often cx- spoke of another vast universe be-
yond even that of the humans above us he told
me of our own relatively small portion of matter
called the earth-although to my primitive in-
telligence its size was almost beyond compre-
hension he described the movements of this
body-he called it a planet-at an enormously
huge distance from a central body of matter-
termed the sun he told of the planets periodic
revolution about this great centre as well as its
own rotational motion about an imaginary axis
he mentioned other planets by name-similar
bodies of matter some larger and some smaller
than the earth which followed their own orbits
about the sun

  so much like our own little selves he said
with our central nucleus and revolving elec-
trons but tremendously-yes infinitely larger

  and beyond this sun-group of planets-he re-
ferred to it as the solar system-there lay even
larger systems reaching out into infinite space-
until the very thought of such never-ending vast-
ness sent my poor mind reeling crazily

  a period of somewhat more than  elec-
tronic age-cycles had now gone by since mv re-
awakening things moved along in our little
realm with about the same cadence as ever to
tell the truth i was beginning to feel terribly
cramped in my meagre location every age-cycle
was like every other age-cycle i felt the shadow
of drab monotony creeping into my existence
when i ventured to voice my feelings to my
neighboring atoms they smilingly reassured me
of better days in the near future

  dont you worry little carbon atom said
cx- with firm assurance very soon were all
going to be delivered from this monotonous life
an atomic

just be patient and once you get into the open
freedom of the world above your existence will
be such a mad whirl of life and action that you
will readily lose all recollection of these dark
ages of imprisonment in coal

  true enough the time suddenly came when i
began to sense the approach of unusual events
i became aware of queer rumblings that seemed
to come to us first from above and then from
all sides faint and distant at the start these
indications of strange activities began to get
stronger and more pronounced as time went on
it appeared to me as though there was extensive
drilling and hammering going on all about us
occasionally we felt strong concussions and vio-
lent spasms of vibration were transmitted from
one atom to the next until we quivered to our
very last electron these were ominous times
for me-i sensed the dawn of a new existence
and yet i dreaded the sudden transition from a
dormant life to one of intense commotion and
activity

  they - the humans above - have com-
menced mining operations announced cx-
with glee it wont be long now before they
reach our stratum-and then- it was evi-
dent from his significant pause that he looked
forward to the liberation with the highest antici-
pation

  i felt the rumbling and knocking coming
louder and closer presently it became impos-
sible for us to communicate with each other on
account of the din and commotion then sud-
denly there came a cataclysmic upheaval i
felt myself myself being ripped from my posi-
tion and thrown about in the wildest confusion
my electrons rolled crazily in their orbits twist-
ing and straining until i thought they would
momentarily break away and be lost in the
chaos when i recovered my senses somewhat
i discovered to my great joy that i was not alone
as i had at first thought i found myself in a
group of my fellow atoms who had apparently
been separated from the rest but the most ex-
tra-ordinary thing about the new state of affairs
was that we were no longer in almost total dark-
ness a strong white light now bathed our lit-
tle group and reflected through our skeleton-like
structure with blinding brilliance

  i turned to find cx- still at my side en-
joying my startled expression with unconcealed
merriment

  frightened arent you he laughed feels
like the end of the world doesnt it nothing
more terrible has happened than that we have
been blasted out of our underground prison and
carried up into the sunlight yes sunlight he
repeated in answer to my expression of doubt
thats the natural form of illumination in this
upper world rather uncomfortably dazzling
isnt it after so many ages in the semi-darkness
of our coal existence

chapter iv

a fascinating world

then followed a period of considerable ex-
citement and commotion during which our
small group of carbon atoms was alternately

adventure	

tumbling about roughly and lying inactive at
times the brilliant sunlight to which i had now
become accustomed was cut off from us and we
were again enshrouded in sombre gloom punc-
tuated only by the faint luminescence of our re-
volving electrons fortunately these periods of
half-darkness were not so frequent and i learned
to enjoy the warming embrace of the sunlight
rays in response to the stimulus i found myself
vibrating more rapidly in my to-and-fro path
and i was surprised and no little delighted that
all my fellow atoms were doing likewise there
appeared to be a general increase of activity in
the group since we were brought forth from our
nether home

  remember explained cx- what i told
you some time ago about heat it is a form of
energy that is associated with molecular and
atomic agitation the effect of the suns rays
upon us is to make us vibrate faster this in-
crease in our activity manifests itself to human
beings through their sense organs as warmth
isnt this new life exhilarating

  i agreed enthusiastically and turned to ob-
serve more of the wonders in my novel surround-
ings i presently became aware of another
strange phenomenon-something i had never
met with in my previous existence as we lay
grouped together in the bright sunlight i noticed
strange masses passing by they came singly
and in bunches some flitting by lazily others
rushing along in a mad hurry

  cx- anticipated my question and answered
it before i could put it into words

  we are now out in the open air this sub-
stance air is something totally different from
our own medium it is made up of several kinds
of atoms and molecules but the interesting part
of it is that these particles are not fixed in semi-
rigid positions as we carbon atoms are air is
known in this realm as a gas while coal is an ex-
ample of a solid in a gasthe individual particles
are relatively far apart and are therefore able
to move about with utmost freedom we carbon
atoms are packed together so tightly that there
is no chance of our doing much in the ways of
motion there is another state in which matter
exists this is called the liquid state and here
the particles of matter are not so distantly sep-
arated that they can move about with no re-
straint nor are they so close together that they
give the substance rigidity theirs is a happy
medium they maintain their relative distances
but they are able to slide over each other with
the utmost smoothness and facility

  just then one of the gas bodies swung close by
our position so near did it brush that one of
my outer electrons came very near being knocked
out of its orbit its passage was rather leisure-
ly and in the interval of time that it was close
to me i had a good opportunity to observe its
peculiar structure it certainly was like nothing
that i had ever seen before two atoms were
fused together not touching but held apart a
short distance by what appeared to be some
strong yet unseen force on closer scrutiny i
thought i recognized them as oxygen atoms for
i had seen similar atoms down in our coal stra-
	wonder stories quarterly

turn yes to be sure they were oxygen atoms
for i could count eight electrons circling about
each

  but no-another double atom swept by and
i observed that it was made up of two slightly
smaller units more nearly approaching my own
size i could make out seven electrons in the
field of each atom this was a substance with
which i was yet unacquainted another oxygen
pair and then two or three more of the new
variety i began to see that the oxygen groups
were greatly outnumbered by the others

  the next diatomic mass that spun by-it hap-
pened to be of the oxygen class-i studied more
closely and i found a complexity in its move-
ment that was bewildering it seemed to have
a number of different motions incorporated in
its make-up in the first place the two atoms
separated from each other by a space were
tumbling over each in the most comical fashion
as they tumbled they dragged along with them
their revolving electrons which maintained their
steady gyrations in two distinct orbits about
each nucleus in addition this strange couplet
maintained an independent vibration induced by
the energy from the sunlight and lastly it had
a propulsive motion that carried it close to me
and then beyond into the maze of particles
above me until it was lost from sight one can
better imagine than describe the composite
whole of all these independent movements the
whirling zig-zagging dizzy flight of this double
creature

  more explaining is now in order smiled my
ever-willing cx- these oxygen atoms that
you see teamed up in pairs represent the normal
state of the element in the gas form it seems
that oxygen atoms are either unable or unwilling
to roam about singly something in them some
indefinable urge impels them to join up in this
manner and travel in pairs perhaps it is some
kind of social instinct-or else just plain lone-
someness at any rate that is how you will al-
ways find them in the air-circulating by twos
-with the union between the partners so firm
that nothing will sever it until the time comes for
the element to enter into combination with other
atoms in the course of various chemical actions
strange as it seems this fusing of two oxygen
atoms results in the formation of what is called
an oxygen molecule which you can see is con-
siderably less complex than most of the mole-
cules that are built up from different kinds of
atoms

  but you notice cx- that the oxygen mole-
cules are greatly outnumbered by another kind
of molecule in fact the actual proportion is five
to one these numerous ones are molecules of
nitrogen another of the gaseous elements here
also the atoms always travel in pairs in fact
the same may be said of all such elements-
but wait im mistaken i almost forgot about
argon the lazy one-look-do you see that
large individual over there he has eighteen
electrons revolving in three rings notice how
slowly and haughtily he moves as if he had not
a single concern in the world and hes all by
himself-wandering about aimlessly and alone

he has never been known to hook up with any
other atom either his own kind or another no
one knows what his mission in life is-i daresay
not even he himself he has a reputation for
sluggishness and general inactivity that is hard
to equal anywhere fortunately there is only a
small number of his particular type present in
the air so that you need have no worry about his
presence here

  now there is just one more member of this
air community continued cx- that you ought
to meet one that i am sure will be of most inter-
est to you let me see if i can point him out to
you - yes-there is one now over to the right
just sliding in between those two nitrogen mole-
cules

  with a little difficulty i was able to single out
the object of my friends attention i was startled
to recognize as its central unit a carbon atom
like myself in some mysterious way he had
managed to connect up with a pair of oxygen
atoms whom he held firmly one on each side
the entire structure with the maze of whirling
electrons was tumbling and skipping about in a
most hilarious fashion

  carbon dioxide my neighbor explained
usually the first step in the cycle of change
from our present position compared to the
other constituents in the air in the matter of
numbers this molecule is almost out of sight on-
ly about one in every  is a carbon dioxide
molecule but important there isnt a single
component with the possible exception of oxy-
gen whose function in life is of more vital neces-
sity wait cx- until you reach that stage in
your activities youll soon come to realize what
an essential factor you are in this vast scheme of
things

a fiery inferno

i could have remained there and watched this
kaleidoscopic parade of molecules forever
but unfortunately i was not the master of my
destiny some superior unseen force was in con-
trol and i as well as all my companion carbon
atoms had no choice but to obey i felt our coa-
lescing group being tumbled and rattled about
in a most unceremonious manner one moment
we would feel ourselves moving along smoothly
the next instant we were hoisted aloft up up
until it seemed as though there would be no stop
then suddenly we were plunged down through
a dizzy descent until we were brought up at
something firm and unyielding with a crash that
almost tore our electrons from their paths this
treatment was repeated any number of times
until i wondered if we were going to spend the
remainder of our existence in such a manner

  at last we seemed to come to rest for good
we were no longer in the brilliant sunshine of
which i had become so inordinately fond in-
stead there was a mantle of gloom all about us
that was strangely reminiscent of our under-
ground coal habitation were we i thought
again to be imprisoned in that horrible place for
ages upon ages of time my comrade cx- at
my side throughout all the vicissitudes of our
hectic adventures hastened to allay my appre-
hensions
an atomic

  sssh-nothing to worry about my dear
cx--nothing to be afraid of were now
several steps closer to our final delivery this
place in which you find yourself at present is a
coal-bin belonging to some human and located
down in the lower part of his dwelling here
we are stored-countless billions of us-but not
for long soon we shall be called upon to be of
service to this man and in doing so we will gain
our freedom we shall be forced to enter into
chemical combination with other atoms thus
producing heat energy to warm his home the
price we are paid for performing this duty is the
most cherished of all-our liberty

  my friends prophecy was fulfilled sooner than
i expected but things had been happening with
such bewildering suddenness that i was but mild-
ly surprised when  felt myself being lifted bodi-
ly along with the other members of our little
coal party we were carried a short distance
and then suddenly dropped into a veritable in-
ferno

  all my previous adventures were mere play
compared to my present predicament below
me was a seething turmoil of activity i observed
countless other carbon atoms vibrating with such
extreme agitation as to emit a fiery red glow
there were hundreds of them hissing and sput-
tering in their mad excitement i felt myself
bombarded by flying missiles on all sides under
the contagious influence of this confusion i too
soon joined the hubub and presently i was con-
tributing my own healthy share to swell the uni-
versal pandemonium

  suddenly in the midst of the general chaos
there came from below a mad rush of oxygen
molecules in and out through the groups of
pulsating carbon atoms they plowed their way
rolling and tumbling over each other in that pe-
culiar fashion which i had observed up in the
sunlight only a short time ago

  and then i perceived an extraordinary phe-
nomenon our staunch carbon ranks were being
disintegrated with almost fiendish abandon
each pair of oxygen atoms seized hold of the
nearest carbon atom and fairly yanked him out
of his spot-electrons and all even in this
feverish rush and excitement i could see that my
comrades were not averse to this treatment in
fact each one seemed to reach forward as the
captivating oxygen couplet approached and
once the contact was made he kicked and tugged
at the invisible bonds that fastened him to the
rest of us as though tired of our company and
anxious to be off on new adventures

  so this was the grand delivery i mused i
wondered vaguely if it hurt i wondered how i
would act when my turn came rapidly the on-
slaught of oxygen molecules was ripping vast
holes in our structure our front melted away
and disappeared as each wave came tearing up
from below this was war destruction-but
strangely welcome to us nevertheless what an
anomaly

  my companion cx- remained staunchly at my
side whispering words of encouragement as the
lurid action continued then with a whirlwind
suddenness we found ourselves in the very thick-

adventure	

est of the fray a stalwart oxygen molecule all
aglow from its passage through the fiery mass
below us pounced upon cx- and he was sum-
marily torn from his moorings i heard his last
cry of cheer to me saw his final gesture of fare-
well and then he soared upward in his new
company and was swallowed up in the furious
storm of recently created molecules rushing on
into the open air

  i turned to find that i was next already my
would-be captors or companions or what shall
i call them-had seized me with a strange un-
seen force and were pulling me away from my
remaining comrades to my vast astonishment
i felt some sort of unconscious urge to join this
strange couple-an indefinable pull or attrac-
tion toward them the like of which i had never
experienced before i yielded readily and with
lazy abandon i permitted myself to be drawn
away from my resting place and bom aloft in
the ascending current

  for a time i was conscious of nothing except
that steady rush upward after the compara-
tive inaction of my coal existence i was drunk
with the giddy exhilaration of the flight-swift
and unrestrained flight on all side i could sense
the same gay enthusiasm all about me the
newly created carbon dioxide molecules-and
i now realized with a pleasant shock that i was
one of them too-bounced and skidded over
each other as if to give expression to this feeling
of exultation

  the dark passageway through which we were
flying came to an abrupt end and i found my-
self with my companion oxygen atoms sailing
along in dazzling sunlight once more it was on-
ly then that i became aware of the full signifi-
cance of my newly-born freedom and i almost
shouted aloud in my exuberance

  out in the open air i found a decided change
of conditions the carbon dioxide molecules
all terrifically agitated from the violent reac-
tion that had taken place in the flaming volcano
below had an opportunity to cool off and assume
a state of relative composure once away from
the confines of the place where we had been gen-
erated we scattered in all directions mingling
with vast crowds of oxygen and nitrogen mole-
cules that surged all about us soon i lost sight
of the rest of our own kind and found myself
all alone with my two companions swamped in
a sea of gas molecules as in my former ex-
perience with air i found the greater major of
them to be nitrogen

  it was natural that after becoming accus-
tomed to my new surroundings and changed
mode of life i should scrape up an acquaintance
with my recently acquired companions they
werent bad-looking fellows at all-one on each
side of me forming a sort of protective barrier
as though to shield me from any injury i mar-
veled at how closely they resembled me in struc-
ture and yet what a difference those two ad-
ditional electrons in their outer ring made all
the difference between a gay vaporous oxygen
atom flying about in the air and a cold hard
inactive carbon atom sunk deep below ground

new companion

  iikt ell carbon began my companion on
 the right lets get acquainted pm
oxy-one and my pal over on the other side is
oxy-two how do you like us as your new travel-
ing partners i guess if not for us your travel-
ing would be very limited indeed

  there now rejoined the other oxygen atom
bragging again arent you and then turn-
ing to me apologetically he added dont pay
any attention to him hes inclined to be a little
chesty about his own importance

  it was not long before i had explained to my
partners that i wasnt an ordinary carbon atom
making the same rounds over and over again-
that this was my first trip as far as my present
recollections served me at first they were in-
clined to doubt my story but my evident sincer-
ity finally won them over they listened atten-
tively as i recounted my awakening from the
sleep of ages down in the coal region of my com-
plete lapse of memory in regard to my former
experiences i told them of my companion atom
cx- about his lengthy explanations of the
world we live in its flux and change its human
plant and animal inhabitants and of the part
we all play in the operation of this vast existence

  so you see my friends i concluded earnest-
ly it is just as though i had been newly created
this trip of adventure on which we are now
launched is to all purposes my first-if i have
ever taken any others i cannot remember them
and except for what cx- told me about the
outside world i dont know what lies ahead of
me

  my partners agreed laughingly that i was the
queerest carbon atom with which they had ever
been hooked up-surely the greenest of all they
had met-and they admitted having associated
with a good number of my family with perfect
good nature however they expressed their will-
ingness to initiate me into the gay and open ex-
istence of this atmospheric life

  tell me about yourselves i asked from
what cx- explained to me i received the im-
pression that you are of very great importance
up here

  without trying to be boastful smiled oxy-
two i daresay we are of the greatest importance
-at least to all living or organic things on earth
in the first place we are the most numerous of
all the atoms about fifty per cent of all mat-
ter-at least in that portion of the universe that
is called earth-is oxygen we are present not
only in the air as the free element but also com-
bined with other atoms in liquids such as water
and in all kinds of solids that are found on the
earths surface and deep below the surface too
we are extremely active chemically by which i
mean that we will combine readily with practi-
cally all of the existing atoms thats more than
any other element can say about itself i dont
care which one you mention and the fact that
we cannot make a perfect  per cent score in
the matter of combination is no fault of ours we
have made repeated advances toward the four or

five stubborn atoms that refuse to unite with us
but they are absolutely unapproachable lazy
indifferent good-for-nothing ambitionless thats
what they are they show no prejudices either
for they shun all close company i guess youve
met argon ringleader of this unsociable clique
he and the few atoms like him float around here
aimlessly through the air with not a care or a
sensible interest in this life im sure youll meet
them all sooner or later

  our mission here added the second oxygen
atom is one on which all life upon this planet
depends we carry on the process of oxidation
in plants animals and human beings by this
process heat is produced as well as the energy
that enables the organism to live and do work
it is through our agency that all combustible
things burn in fact the late turmoil in which
we took part-i dont think you can forget it so
easily can you-was nothing more than a very
rapid oxidation of the members of your carbon
tribe man uses this process to heat his dwelling
during the cold seasons of the earthly year he
burns fuel to generate power so that he could
light his home when the sun is not sending down
rays upon his side of the earth he employs this
power also to run great engines to move huge
masses and to perform a thousand miracles of
strength and skill

  notice how few we oxygen molecules are in
the air when compared with the great numbers
of those other molecules-nitrogen about one
particle in every five is a member of our family
do you know why its just a device to keep us
in check if we were permitted to accumulate by
ourselves we would exert so much combined
power as to cause an awful conflagration there
is practically nothing that would withstand our
strong appeal to unite with us and once such a
general action started no power on earth could
stop it it has therefore been found necessary to
mix large numbers of practically inert nitrogen
molecules they serve to dilute the oxygen mole-
cules to diminish our strength and thus to min-
imize the danger of our running amuck

  secretly i felt myself flattered to be thrown
into such fiery company there was a thrill at
the thought of so much vigor and energy being
associated with these harmless looking atoms that
clung on each side of me here i said to myself
was all romance and adventure for which i had
been aching

a scandalous idea

the three of us got along famously they
supplied me with a great deal of information
about the world and the living inhabitants of all
kinds that peopled it both on the surface in the
air and in the vast stretches of liquid matter
which they called oceans i in turn enlightened
them considerably on what i knew of atomic ex-
istence in the only region with which i was at
present familiar-the depths of the earth ap-
parently it had been many ages since they had
last had the opportunity of living in the nether
regions so that their notions in regard to them
were very vague i did not know much but i
made a fairly creditable effort to set them aright
an atomic

on conditions in the shadowy yet fascinating and
romantic land of coal

  the longer we were together in our own priv-
ate little molecule the more i wondered and mar-
veled at our basic atomic structure from the
very start when we first joined forces down there
in that fiery furnace i was struck by our great
similarity of make-up

  isnt it queer i once remarked to oxy-two
how much alike we are and yet how vastly dif-
ferent now my nucleus is practically the same
as yours we are both made of the same sub-
stance-the thing that humans call electricity
we both have two rings of electrons revolving in
orbits that are about alike in size theres just
that tiny difference you have eight satellites and
i have only six and yet that small difference
places us worlds apart in appearance properties
behavior and chemical action that small dif-
ference makes you oxygen and me carbon

  true enough echoed oxy-two seriously-
you are carbon and i am oxygen-and all be-
cause of that apparently trifling matter of elec-
trons did you ever realize my dear atom that
even a difference of one electron in our rotational
fields is enough to create just as fundamental a
disparity as exists between you and me surely
you must have met our good friend nitrogen his
position is right between carbon and oxygen in
this classification he possesses seven electrons
and his atomic number is seven nevertheless he
resembles me no more than he resembles you
he is just as far-removed from us in ideas and
behavior as he is from the remaining eighty-nine
members of our atomic world

  it just occurred to me i remarked-but
no-thats a terribly silly notion i laughed
half to myself and turned to my oxygen asso-
ciates well maybe its not such a foolish
thought after all what would happen if you
were to lose one electron from your outer shell
or suppose i were to gain one electron that
would give us each seven-exactly the same
number as nitrogen has would you and i change
into atoms of nitrogen

   i looked iirtjuiringly from one to the other of
my companions and i observed that they were
deeply puzzled by this apparently simple sup-
position

  i never did look at it that way mused oxy-
two thoughtfully-although i dont see any
other answer-yes-i guess we would become
nitrogen atoms wouldnt we partner turning
to the other oxygen particle

  not unless we were subjected to a correspond-
ing alteration in our nucleus structure was oxy-
ones guarded reply remember carbon atom
your constitution depends upon a perfect balance
of opposing forces positive and negative charges
of electricity in order for this change which
you suggest to be effected you must add a posi-
tively charged proton to your nucleus to compen-
sate for the addition of a negatively charged
electron to your outer ring otherwise you would
be electrically unbalanced likewise if i lose
an electron from my field i must also relinquish
a proton from my nucleus

  and such changes added oxy-two are un-

adventure	

heard of-the idea is positively scandalous to
think of a self-respecting atom ever stepping out
of its own designated station in life and trying to
be somebody else why its-preposterous

  i merely thought was my hasty rejoinder
that such alterations are not beyond the realm
of possibility with atoms and molecules always
moving about in vast crowds bumping scraping
colliding with each other doesnt it seem likely
that one of them might accidently have an out-
side electron knocked off particularly the big
fellows-those with the high atomic numbers
and with six or seven electronic rings containing
eighty or ninety electrons in their field i can-
not see how an atom can possibly keep track of
eighty or more whirling electrons all at the same
time just suppose that i were let say an atom
of uranium it seems to me that if i should as
a result of some extra-violent collision accidently
lose one or two electrons from the out-lying dis-
tricts of my structure i would never even miss
them

  well retorted oxy-one as far as my know-
ledge goes it has never happened-and remem-
ber that atoms and molecules have been colliding
from the very dimmest beginnings of time atoms
have always behaved in a perfectly sane and con-
ventional manner their internal structures have
always been regarded as permanent and un-
changing there is no case on record where a
carbon atom has ever been anything but a car-
bon atom nor an oxygen atom anything but an
oxygen atom

  hold on a moment interrupted oxy-two
hastily it seems to me i have a vague recollec-
tion of certain rumors that traveled around a long
time ago concerning the unusual behavior of one
of the atoms something about losing electrons
and changing into simpler atoms it was all
hearsay yet the reports circulated for a long
period now let me see-what element was
that anyway-one of the heavier substances
im positive-why-to be sure-wasnt it that
rare element radiwmf

  now that you mention it rejoined oxy-one
thoughtfully i do remember some talk about
radium they say that those atoms persisted in
breaking the unwritten law of atomic integrity
but everything was rumor-nothing definite-
no real first-hand information about this alleged
phenomenon im sure the stories were all just
a lot of slick publicity material probably in-
tended to put this extremely rare atom promin-
ently in the public eye thats the trouble with
those fourth rate elements theyre jealous of
our great abundance and our vast importance in
this scheme of things some of them are always
trying to edge in a little and capture for them-
selves an unearned position of popular favor i
never paid much attention to those far-fetched
tales about radium and no one else did either
im certain

  in spite of the evident scepticism of my friends
i was not so easily dissuaded from my pet belief
the idea seemed entirely logical to me and i
could not see why such a phenomenal occurrence
as losing electrons was so hopelessly impossible
and furthermore what about those reports in re-
	wonder stories quarterly

gard to the strange action of this rare element
radium surely rumors do not persist without
some semblance of foundation

  i pictured to myself how delightful it would
be if an atom were able at will to slice off or
take on electrons what a huge field of rom-
ance lay ahead of such a fortunate individual
now one kind of atom-at another time some
different kind-new experiences and new thrills
at every turn and every change-no longer re-
structed to the humdrum life of a carbon atom
or a hydrogen atom-the whole vast gamut of
atomic adventure would be at ones command
indeed a thought to fire ones imagination

  i cannot explain by what remarkable coinci-
dence i was destined to have my little experience
with radium so soon after our conversation on the
subject of atomic disintegration surely the in-
cident could not have occurred at a more oppor-
tune time for i was worked up to the highest
pitch of enthusiasm regarding the possibilities of
such changes

radium-the mystery

  our little carbon dioxide molecule had now
been floating about in the air for a consider-
able period of time without anything more thrill-
ing than the continuous buffeting by the ocean of
oxygen and nitrogen molecules i was beginning
to entertain grave doubts as to whether this new
life was really so terribly exciting to be sure
we were in a constant change and flux never
resting always in motion-yet one tires of that
too after an interminable stretch of the same
purposeless roving conversation among the
three members of our little unit began to lag no-
ticeably there was very little new to talk about
so that for the most part we remained speech-
less

  it was only a short time after our talk about
radium when during the course of our mono-
tonous drifting i suddenly became aware of a
mysterious change there was some sort of rest-
less uneasiness among the atmospheric mole-
cules that flew by they appeared to be more
agitated-in a greater hurry-and yet i could
see that it wasnt associated with any increase
in vibration that i knew accompanies a rise in
temperature and yet i could feel that our own
molecule seemed to be bowing to the same mys-
terious influence for unconsciously we found
ourselves thrilled and activated by an uncontroll-
able force

  suddenly there was a startled exclamation
from oxy-two

  did you see that he gasped it flew right
by us off to the left-something round and lum-
inous-and what speed-just like a flash
theres another i blurted out in high ex-
citement and another-two more-why theres
a whole stream of them

electrons whispered oxy-one in awe free
electrons-more and more of them and theyre
not revolving about a nucleus-just traveling by
themselves-and did you ever see such speed
these detached luminous balls of negative

electricity identical with the electrons that
circled so obediently around our own nuclei
were now flying past us in hords and droves
there were so many thousands of them and their
velocity was so tremendous that they created the
impression of continuous luminous streaks tear-
ing through our world how many air molecules
were hit i dont know what damage was
wrought by this cloud of flying missiles i cannot
tell by some miraculous fate we were spared
any disastrous collision

  in the face of this fiery bombardment when
all else was fleeing panic stricken before the
strange onslaught i suddenly conceived the idea
of edging toward the centre of the disturbance to
find out what was the cause i had no difficulty
in winning my companions over to my scheme
adjacent air molecules counciled us against the
foolhardiness of flying blindly into danger

  its radium cried a nearby nitrogen mole-
cule stopping in his precipitous flight with a
breathless message of warning the rare ele-
ment radium his atoms are breaking up
there are some terrible things happening over
there in the centre of that upheaval keep away
its sheer suicide to approach

  so that is whats causing all the rumpus i
shouted to my partners radium all the
more reason for investigating come on oxy-
one -oxy-two-lets go 

  as we drew closer to the spot from which the
seething thousands of electrons appeared to be
flying we perceived a new kind of emanation in
the form of atomic particles they also came in
streams but they were larger and traveled at a
much slower speed than the electrons i could
see that they were atoms of some strange sort
for each consisted of a central nucleus like my
own only much smaller with two electrons
circling around it in a single orbit oxy-one
promptly recognized them as helium atoms-one
of the rare and inert gases associated with argon
in the atmosphere

  in all the turmoil and excitement we managed
to corner one of the rapidly moving helium atoms
taking advantage of the momentary shelter af-
forded by a crowd of air molecules that shielded
us somewhat from the steady electronic bombard-
ment we pressed him for information about the
radium disintegration

  let me go he pleaded im in a terrible
hurry yes-thats radium in there-my own
parent element-breaking up-decomposing-
exploding im a new atom-just born-im a
product of atomic disintegration-and im in a
terrible rush-please please let me go

  we permitted him to slip by and he soon dis-
appeared in a stream of his fellows all hastening
away from the centre of the storm as we ap-
proached closer we found signs of greater more
violent agitation there was a raging bubbling
chaos of atoms molecules and electrons and our
own solitary carbon dioxide molecule was pum-
meled and driven about until we were bewildered
and almost overcome

  then suddenly we burst in upon the very cen-
tre of commotion in the mad blast of electrons
that shot out at us we were almost swept from
an atomic

our position but we managed to hang on and
view the appalling drama of atomic disintegra-
tion

  the middle of the stage was occupied by a
fiery clump of matter consisting of masses of
seething protons and electrons the like of which
i had never witnessed i could see that the rad-
ium atoms huge and ponderous though they
were milled about in the throes of a violent com-
motion there was a steady and deafening stac-
cato of explosions and as the hundreds of radium
atoms burst apart there issued streams of fiery
electrons and newly created helium atoms flying
off into space in all directions another emana-
tion sprang away from the disrupting radium
atoms but its speed was so terrific that i was un-
able to obtain any clear image of it the residual
portions of the old radium atoms continued to ex-
plode at intervals sending off repeated showers
of electrons further and further the dramatic
breaking-down process continued until after a
series of newly formed and short-lived atoms had
come and gone one form remained dropping
away from the violent activity of the rest these
remaining atoms collected in a corner sizzling
and trembling from their feverish evolution

  lead atoms  whispered oxy-two in an awe-
stricken tone the end-product of the radium de-
composition

  we remained in our position as long as we
dared but eventually it became entirely too haz-
ardous for us to maintain our watch and so we
yielded to the swift current of flying particles
and were born rapidly away from the vivid and
dramatic scene presently the streams of elec-
trons thinned out we slowed up in our progress
and before long were back again amid the famil-
iar environments of our atmospheric existence
none the worse for our daring sally into the very
jaws of certain destruction once again we
rubbed familiarly against oxygen and nitrogen
molecules who seemed to be totally unaware of
the existence of the fiery region from which we
had just come

  the lurid picture of an atom crumbling in its
innermost structure remained indelibly burned
into my consciousness i had not even the faint-
est suspicion that before long i myself would play
the leading role in a similar drama of disintegra-
tion and destruction

through the green prison

our little carbon dioxide molecule continued
to roam about more or less aimlessly al-
ways on the move never lingering at any one spot
long enough to get acquainted impelled by
some mysterious driving force we felt ourselves
egged on to continuous motion we were alter-
nately bathed in warm sunlight and plunged in-
to almost impenetrable darkness the periods fol-
lowing each other with methodical regularity
this rotation of light and dark my oxygen
friends explained were called by man day and
night and it was the method he used to measure
the passage of time evidently he knew nothing
about our own complex time-measuring system
based on the periodic rotation of our electrons

sometimes we soared up up into the rarefied

adventure	

strata of the atmosphere where although the sun
shone brightly there was a numbing chill about
us and our vibratory motion became feeble and
sluggish in those upper regions we felt our-
selves practically alone for we would travel vast
spaces before encountering any other atmospher-
ic molecules for the most part however we
kept close to the earths surface where although
living conditions were more crowded still it was
comfortably warm and there was that feeling of
security derived from the physical presence of
myriads of other molecules all about us some-
how i didnt mind the buffeting and colliding so
much-i regarded it all as an essential concomi-
tant of my existence as part of a gaseous mole-
cule

  then one day during one of the periods of sun
luminosity our molecule began to enter a region
of vast green shadows oxy-one informed me
that we were passing in the vicinity of leaves-
the appendages growing on plants ah yes-
i had been told all about plants their abundance
on earth-their importance-and this was my
first contract with them

  we were carried by a swift current toward a
huge orifice-so large an opening as to encom-
pass my entire vision it was one vast green cav-
ity that yawned and swallowed a thousand mole-
cules in its maw i found myself in a spacious
dimly-lighted chamber that towered and
stretched to magnificent distances a dull green-
ish glow percolated through some mysterious por-
tions of the distant roof and walls everywhere
the green hue prevailed i was fantastic beyond
description

  now youll see some action whispered oxy-
two weve just entered through a stoma lead-
ing to the interior of the leaf our time has
come my carbon friend-we shall soon part
company old associations melt he laughed
softly new ones are born-such is the existence
of all of us-this is the ceaseless routine we will
follow until the very end of time

  within the vast chamber there was a scene of
bustling activity-it appears that whenever
molecules get together into intimate contacts
there is always a scene of bustling activity i re-
cognized more carbon dioxide molecules all
about me as well as free double-oxygen mole-
cules and many water groups these latter i
had met before in my wanderings-a single oxy-
gen atom fused with a pair of those flighty hy-
drogen atoms of which i had heard so much

  from what i could gather the chief commo-
tion inside of the leaf centered about the carbon
dioxide and the water particles they were be-
ing lined up in some complex structure whose
nature i could not for a moment make out the
masters of ceremony seemed to be a scattered
few molecules having a bright green color and
a complicated makeup that i was riot able to
fathom i could discern a number of carbon
atoms in their structure as well as oxygen and
hydrogen atoms but the configuration was total-
ly strange to me

  these are chlorophyll molecules remarked
oxy-two by way of information they are the
bosses of these works they control the chief
	wonder stories quarterly

process that goes on in the leaf-the process of
photosynthesis or starch-making

  more new terms-more strange experiences i
thought but i was resolved not to become fright-
ened at any unusual development i could see
that the very essence of atomic existence was
change-change-nothing but change

  under the hypnotic influence of the nearest
chlorophyll chief we moved along swiftly to a
spot that he designated where we found others
like ourselves waiting i saw a group of carbon
atoms lined up in the form of a chain with hy-
drogen and oxygen atoms making contact here
there and everywhere along the chain autom-
atically almost as though i had been doing noth-
ing else all my life i slipped into the unfinished
structure oxy-one was gently dislodged from
my side and slid smoothly away to join up with
the third carbon atom from me oxy-two hug-
ging me closely reached out and apprehended a
stray hydrogen atom which he held fast i found
myself securely tied by invisible bonds to the car-
bon atoms above and below me as well as to the
other members of our chain

  so swiftly did this synthetic process proceed
that before i was aware of it i found myself an
integral part of a sizeable molecule oxy-two
the remaining partner of my former association
told me that we were now part and parcel of a
starch molecule and that we were in line for more
activity in a short time in looking about me i
could see that instead of there being one long
carbon chain as i had first believed the new
structure consisted of units each made up of six
carbon atoms in a string together with ten hy-
drogen atoms and five oxygen atoms how many
such single units there were in the starch mole-
cule i could not perceive but there was no doubt
that the structure of this new substance was ex-
tremely complex

  after a small group of starch molecules had
been built up from the component materials we
felt ourselves dislodged from our resting place
and began to slide along in a definite lateral di-
rection we were joined by similar groups and
soon we were a considerable body of newly
formed molecules all moving as though being
born by a smooth current presently we found
ourselves no longer in the vast green factory
chamber we were now in a wide passageway
sloping gently downward the light was very
dim although i could make out with no great
difficulty that the walls were constructed of sta-
tionary molecules in close formation i could
see that the carbon atom constituted the build-
ing nucleus of these structural molecules

  our journey down through the darkened pass-
ageways seemed to be interminable what new
adventures i mused lay in store for me at the
bottom of this dizzy descent oxy-two reas-
sured me that things would now be somewhat
uneventful how long a period he didnt know
we were traveling down to the roots of the plant
below the ground he told me there to be stored
away he was unable to say what sort of a plant
this was nor how long our confinement would
last we reached bottom at last a cold gloomy
network of chambers strangely reminiscent of

my coal kingdom the starch molecule of which
i was a portion was pushed along not too gently
and finally came to rest along with many others
in an out-of-the-way corner of one of these cham-
bers

  my spirits sank at the prospects of another
cheerless spell of imprisonment still fresh from
the care-free existence following my delivery
from the coal condition i rebelled inwardly at
this return to a cramped and monotonous life i
had tasted of the sweets of liberty and i felt not
at all willing to change back to my former state
of inactivity

  i soon entered into conversation with the near-
by carbon atoms in our chain and they assured
me that my fear of protracted imprisonment was
goundless they informed me that we were
now part of a potato plant and were stored away
below ground in a portion of the plants root sys-
tem i was relieved to learn that our confinement
in this state would last for a comparatively short
period-only a few weeks as reckoned by mans
process of time-recording-and no more than a
fleeting instant when measured by our own elec-
tronic rotational system

chapter vil
a new life

our time soon arrived and i discovered that
the new sensations were not unlike those
that i had experienced when i was dislodged
from my coal existence but there was now none
of the violence and terrific commotion that i re-
membered from that period i was conscious of
a distant scraping and rumbling and then i felt
our group of starch molecules being lifted bodily
more movements now up now down-more
periods of rest some short some long then i
gradually began to sense that familiar increase
in vibratory oscillation which i now knew was
associated with heat

  cooking was the explanation of oxy-two la-
conically our potato is being prepared for
human food just another step in this endless
cycle of change and adventure

  i experienced no radical alteration as a result
of this cooking process although i heard from
my neighbors that the heat had softened the
walls of our prison chamber then followed
a bewildering succession of events i found our
molecules being churned up with others some
simpler in structure but most of them of greater
complexity than our starch group during these
hectic occurrences i was able to learn from my
comrades that the potato was being chewed by
some human being swallowed and mixed with
various materials in this beings stomach and diges-
tive system to render us soluble strange as these
terms were to me and stranger the actual
events i had come to accept all new happen-
ings as if they were perfectly commonplace mat-
ters

  in these digestive processes taking place deep
down in the stygian depths of this creatures
anatomy i found that many of the strange mole-
cules near me were undergoing a radical break-
ing down into simpler substances even our own
an atomic

complex starch molecule began to divide up in
conformity with a certain definite plan of dis-
solution a number of passing water molecules
attached themselves to our structure and pre-
sently the whole bulky organization fell away
into a scrambling group of individual carbon
chains which had formed the units of the orig-
inal starch molecule each new structure now
contained six carbons twelve hydrogens and six
oxygens and i found myself occupying nearly
the central position of one of these chains a
neighboring atom referred to our new molecule
as glucose or grapesugar what names to confuse
and befuddle an uninitiated carbon atom like my-
self

  the glucose molecules were now endowed
with greater alacrity for being so much smaller
they were able to slide through spaces and crev-
ices that would have halted them while in the
starch stage oxy-two whispered to me that we
were now digested and would next proceed to
pass through the lining of this human creatures
digestive system into his blood stream and pre-
sently after much devious twisting and sliding
our glucose molecule found itself floating along
smoothly through some huge passageway urged
on by a swift pulsating current of countless other
molecules many of them i recognized but a
few were strangers to me on all sides of us
floated huge red masses composed of thousands
of carbon-bearing molecules on and on we
rushed in that rhythmatic surge driven forward
by some gigantic push that repeated itself like
powerful blows behind us

  soon the vast passageway narrowed and the
pulsing became less and less pronounced in the
diminishing strength of the current we now
moved more sluggishly i learned that we were
passing through the capillaries the finest of all
the tubes that made up the elaborate circulation
system of this individual presently we were
squeezed through the wall-like structure of the
tunnel and found ourselves in a huge chamber
that one of my friends characterized as a cell
here we came upon further scenes of activity
so many different things were going on all about
me that i could obtain no more than a confused
impression of the kaleidoscopic whole mole-
cules were being torn apart and their component
atoms seized upon and reconstructed into dif-
ferent entities free atoms were scurrying
hither and thither with an air of bustle and im-
portance orders flew back and forth com-
mands were issued by unseen directors of the
activities and almost in a flash they were carried
out as our glucose molecule retired somewhat
to one side awaiting our final disposition in this
theatre of activity oxy-two explained to me that
this cell was the unit of plant and animal life
on earth here all functions of living things were
carried on all the processes effected which made
up the life of the organism and it was with a
sense of pride that i observed what a paramount
role in this drama of action and change was en-
acted by my own kin-the carbon atom

  our turn came soon the recently formed glu-
cose molecule melted away under the influence
of some mysterious disintegrating force i found

adventure	

myself momentarily floating about alone for the
first time it occurred to me since my existence in
coal long-oh so long ago then in the next
instant i found myself seized by a pair of oxy-
gen atoms that appeared to come from nowhere
at all automatically i accepted their proffered
bonds and found myself again the central figure
of a carbon dioxide molecule

  what a relief to be in so simple a structure
again instead of in those bulky and awkward
starch and glucose arrangements i felt myself
free and unhampered now skipping sliding
bouncing along merrily we-my two new oxy-
gen partners and myself-presently emerged
from the cell and into a blood capillary once
more i discovered many more dioxide molecules
in the stream as well as new structures that i
learned were waste products of the processes
taking place in the cell in fact i learned with
surprise and not a little chagrin that we carbon
dioxide particles were regarded as just as much
of a waste product as the others oh well i as-
sured myself its all a part of the life of the atom
and i was certain that i would not remain a
waste material very long

  in the blood stream we hooked up with a scar-
let material of an undistinguishable complex
structure it was not my choice at all to engage
in this union it was effected rather by a myster-
ious attractive force emanating from this red
body on questioning one of my oxygen atoms
i learned that the colored material was hoemo-
globin and that our combination with it was pure-
ly temporary intended only to facilitate our pass-
age through the blood stream

  our way led through numerous tunnels
branching into each other until ave found our-
selves surging through a passageway of such
prodigious proportions that i could not discern
its boundaries we passed through a tremen-
dously vast chamber or a series of chambers
wher the turmoil and commotion was terrific
this i learned was the creatures heart the cen-
tral pumping station that drove the blood with
its burden of material throughout the complex
network of tubes in the body

  again through a huge passageway and pre-
sently through narrower and narrower tubes un-
til we were back in the capillaries again here
i began to discern a roaring rushing sound simi-
lar to the noise made by millions of rapidly mov-
ing molecules up in my former existence in the
atmosphere presently we found ourselves dis-
lodged from the hoemoglobin of the blood
stream and together with countless other free
carbon dioxide molecules were squeezed through
narrow crevices and hurtled out into empty
space and as we sped outward i perceived a
rush of oxygen molecules descending from
above and crowding into our old positions in the
hoemoglobin molecules of the blood

  dispossessed-and yet happy to get out of our
confinement and into the state of gaseous free-
dom once more with a rush and a roar we were
forced upward and violently expelled into a blaze
of sunshine we had just passed through the
lungs of this human creature and were now once
	wonder stories quarterly

again in the familiar environment of the atmos-
phere

monotony-and tragedy

back in the air with hordes of nitrogen and
oxygen molecules all about us and occasion-
ally a molecule like ours i began my customary
round of activity first it was this combination
and then that atomic union drifting and wan-
dering joining up with others or traveling alone
i was in a constant process of change and ex-
change now i found myself in some mineral
below the ground then i was part of a plant
then food for some animal then part of his body
then expelled in some molecular union or other
and so round and round without an aim without
a serious purpose in life just drifting and wan-
dering wherever the forces of chemical attraction
impelled me sometimes i found myself alone-
more frequently in the company of other atoms
but ever moving changing building up breaking
down ever on the go and ever a carbon atom

  often in my quieter moments i thought back to
that time it seemed so distant now-when i was
a witness to the atomic disintegration of radium
the supreme enthusiasm that fired me on that
memorable occasion had not completely left me
the romantic possibilities that opened themselves
at the mere idea of atomic transmutation were al-
most beyond my imagination to comprehend
what wouldnt i give i often thought for that
unique ability to drop or add electrons and
change at will from one element to another the
life of a carbon atom after rounds and cycles of
the same changes the same configurations and
associations had now begun to spell for me un-
utterable humdrum there were ninety-one
other elements and therefore ninety-one other
wells of experiences to tap surely with the fac-
ulty of atomic transmutation one could go on to
the very end of time with enough variety and
change to satisfy even the most adventurous

  but i was compelled to admit to myself that
such conjectures were far from the realm of im-
mediate possibility-at least for myself i was
no radium atom and i could never hope to attain
any such distinction in the atomic classification
with a sinking sense of resignation i abandoned
myself to my monotonous existence i often
thought of my old friend cx- of the coal stage
and of oxy-one and oxy-two somehow in all
the turmoil of new associations and changing
combinations these characters stood out preem-
inent in my recollections where were they now 
what interminable ocean of molecules separated
us now would i ever see them again

  yes i did run into dear old cx- for a mere
instant and under the most dramatic condition
myriads of electronic age-cycles of change had
inured me to a life of constantly shifting associa-
tions so that i was nothing more than mildly
surprised to find myself once as part of a strange
bulky molecule made up of a number of carbon
nitrogen and oxygen molecules we were in al-
most complete darkness and packed together so
that there was almost no room in which to exer-
cise our customary vibratory motions what new
configuration was this but who cared i half-

dozed lazily in my new berth wondering vaguely
what my next position would be after this asso-
ciation was broken up

  soon however i became aware of something
different there was a feeling of tension all
about me that i had never sensed in any of my
other unions our configuration in these new
molecules did not appear to be stable or rigid
the nitrogen and oxygen atoms of my own group
seemed to be tugging at their bonds and strain-
ing nervously in their assigned positions
throughout the entire structure i could observe
an uneasy restlessness an uncanny undercurrent
of weakness that brooded no good for the safety
of our edifice some inexplicable danger ap-
peared to hover over us as though a mere touch
would start the crash that would hurl us all to de-
struction

  suddenly i was brought into startled wakeful-
ness by a familiar call at my side i turned to
perceive cx- right next to me in this topsy-
turvy rickety carbon chain our greetings were
warm although hurried somehow there seemed
to be no time in which to exchange experiences
much as we should have liked to that indefin-
able air of grim forboding hung like a pall over
us something was going to happen i felt and
very soon at that

  high explosive cx- managed to blurt out
were in a huge shell-war-the humans
are fighting each other-killing each other-i
dont know what its all about no one else does-
not even the humans - its madness-stark
madness-and they are using us to hurl death
and destruction at each other oh the futility
of it all-cx- good-bye-i feel were going
to part soon-maybe well meet again-maybe
under happier circumstances-good-b-

  his words were choked off by a tremendous
crash that shook our unstable structure into a
seething mass of quivering atoms the detona-
tion tore me away from my fellows in the carbon
chain and hurled me into a scrambling heap of
shrieking nitrogen and carbon atoms reeling
crazily in the mad turmoil i managed to seize a
pair of oxygen atoms to form my old familiar
combination before we could stop ourselves a
powerful force shot us upward in a roaring fury
of molecules at the height of this mad excite-
ment i lost cx- again vaguely i hoped that
he had fared well in escaping from this inferno
of destruction out into the open air again we
shot and presently the furore died down our
vigorous vibration slowed up once more i sailed
serenely through the atmosphere none the worse
for my last harrowing adventure

  roaming wandering uniting decomposing
changing-the same ceaseless whirl all over
again my recent experience in the-war episode
did not serve to brighten my outlook on atomic
life it is true that at rare intervals i took part
in incidents that might be regarded in the nature
of comedy once i found myself as elementary
carbon floating in a liquid which was known to
the humans as india ink one of their creatures-
he was called a cartoonist-spread me out along
with millions of my carbon comrades in the form
of a funny picture which caused many of his fel-
an atomic

low humans to laugh especially the younger
members of the species-the children on an-
other occasion also as free carbon i was part of
a printed page in a humorous book made by one
human to be read and laughed over by other hu-
mans again i was one of a vast number of
carbon atoms used once by a member of that
race to blacken his face in this condition he
stood up before a vast assemblage of his fellow
beings and threw them into convulsions of
laughter by his words and antics

  but my rapidly souring disposition at my lot
prevented me from joining in the merriment of
the situations or from realizing the part that i
played to entertain those human beings i had
become an abject pessimist nothing but grim
tragedy stared me in the face and  took almost
fiendish glee in the perpetration of or the par-
ticipation in tragic events

  for example while once undergoing combus-
tion as elementary carbon i as well as the other
members of the carbon group found that there
was an insufficient supply of oxygen molecules
to satisfy us all a rather selfish scramble en-
sued with the result that a number of us man-
aged to escape from the group each united with
only one oxygen atom in this carbon monoxide
state i found myself in a decidedly dissatisfied
condition i was morose and sullen at my half-
ration of oxygen and i found myself glaring
covetously at any free oxygen that happened to
pass me by

  in the course of time a large group of our
newly formed monoxide units entered a dark
passageway and i soon recognized the familiar
approaches into a humans breathing apparatus
-his lungs with almost fiendish glee we
pressed our way down into the cavernous air sacs
and through the wall spaces into the capillary
blood stream we were met by crowds of scar-
let hoemoglobin molecules all clamoring for oxy-
gen atoms i laughed unroariously as our hood-
lum horde of monoxide molecules plunged in
each seizing upon a hoemoglobin unit and at-
taching itself with a tenacious grip we pushed
our way triumphantly through the blood stream
chuckled gleefully at the gasping body cells
they pleaded for the life-giving oxygen which
was novhere to be had and we danced about in
ghoulish ecstacy as the cells shriveled and died

  soon i grew tired of this sport and cast about
to learn what next i could do i discovered that
the blood was coursing more and more slowly
through the tunnels and finally reached a point
of total stagnation the numbing chill of death
pervaded everything and i shuddered at the
ghastly horror of our mad act we had poisoned
a human-caused his life processes to cease be-
cause of our presence in his body and then my
sordid being almost laughed aloud at the pure
deviltry of the whole thing

  it was not long before the work of decay and
disintegration of the mans corpse had proceeded
to the stage where i was again liberated in the
company of oxygen as a gaseous carbon monox-
ide molecule again i found myself wearily
floating in the air buffeted about by flocks of

adventure	

other molecules pursuing the same unspeakable
monotony of existence

chapter viii

an eternal poison

i had no idea when i parted with cx- back
in that war-time charge of high explosive that
i would ever see him again but even our incon-
ceivbly vast atomic world it seems is small
enough for such chance meetings as part of a
large hydrocarbon gas molecule which was un-
dergoing combustion i found myself deposited
as elementary carbon on a cold surface along
with countless others of my kind in the form of
lampblack one of the purest forms of carbon in
existence sure enough there at my side rested
good old cx- just as he did way back in those
days in the coal stratum

  we had much to exchange regarding our ex-
periences both before and since our fleeting mo-
ment in the war explosive when cx- learned
about my radical proclivities in regard to atomic
transmutation he was shocked almost beyond
words

  come come he pleaded why arent you
content with just remaining a law-abiding self-
respecting carbon atom as you were by nature
designed this morbid moping wont get you
anywhere brace up cx- this carbon life is
not so bad after all why i hear rumors that our
little group here in this lampblack is soon to un-
dergo a wonderful transition-something in
which few carbon atoms are ever privileged to
participate just wait and see my friend cx-
-youll be surprised and delghted

  i mumbled my scepticism in some incoherent
syllables and assumed a sullen silence soon i
felt myself being raised and transported-where
i was going and for what was none of my im-
mediate concern i yielded to everything with
total indifference suddenly i found myself pre-
cipitated with violent force into a seething mass
of matter-i recognized the new molecules as
those of the element iron and what a boiling ef-
fervescent mass it was in the terrific heat our
carbon atoms danced and sizzled with extreme
violence cx- and i managed to stay close to-
gether and in the clamorous turmoil he imparted
to me the information that we were being dis-
solved in molten iron after a period of this fiery
mixing we found ourselves suddenly subjected to
a tremendous pressure from above below and
from all sides came this crushing force that
gripped and squeezed us until we felt as though
our very internal atomic structure was about to
be wrecked

  my thoughts flew to that memorable occasion
when i stood so close to this disintegrating rad-
ium atoms and watched the phenomenal trans-
mutation of elements could this present pro-
cess be transmutation too was i now to under-
go that dreamed-of change into some other ele-
ment semi-conscious under the effect of the
crushing force from all about me i conjectured
vaguely as to the probable outcome of this pain-
ful adventure
	wonder stories quarterly

  presently under the terrific pressure a few
of the carbon atoms were pressed into new posi-
tions which strangely enough i discovered to be
of almost matchless regularity where we had
previously been arranged in no particular order
or alignment we now discovered ourselves situ-
ated in a definite and regular pattern even in
the almost unbearable heat and under the vast
pressing force that clamped us from all sides
i could see a certain beauty about our new con-
figuration that i had never witnessed before

  we cooled very slowly and during the time that
this cooling process consumed cx- told me what
had happened you and i he said with evident
feeling are now part of a diamond crystal-still
carbon remember but with the atoms arranged
in a definite geometric scheme that is unknown
among the other forms of carbon we are now
crystallized carbon-the hardest substance on
earth-and a substance of such intrinsic value as
to be prized very highly by all humans

  this is the first time in my long existence
he continued that i have ever been in the dia-
mond state once a very long time ago i met
a number of carbon atoms in this same crystal-
lized formation they told me of how they had
been altered from their original condition of dis-
organized atoms in much the same manner as we
have just been changed but according to their
explanation they had arrived in the diamond
state after a long and tedious process that went
on for ages and ages below the ground

  they told me that the very essence of this
unique alteration is the slow and painstaking re-
arrangement of carbon atoms under the influence
of tremendous heat and pressure and that the
most important factor is time-eons of time
never did i realize that this slow transition could
be speeded up so remarkably its those human
scientists-they have means of duplicating na-
tures work and accomplishing it in a fraction of
the time ordinarily required what powerful
forces they command what skill they possess

  our diamond crystals were now subjected to an
extensive treatment the surrounding iron atoms
were melted away by a rush of molecules that
cx- told me belonged to a substance known as
hydrochloric acid we were not affected by this
cleansing agent and before long we found our-
selves again in the glorious sunlight the strong
rays of light penetrated our new structure twist-
ing and rebounding in a most dazzling array of
brilliance certainly i never realized that ordin-
arily dull carbon atoms could work such wonders
with light rays what a remarkable difference
our new atomic configuration made

  i had scarcely become accustomed to my new
situation when i received a bit of news that gave
me a considerable jolt it was cx- himself who
imparted to me the new information he con-
fided to me very solemnly indeed that we dia-
mond atoms were destined to spend the rest of
our existence in this condition no more change
he informed me-no more chemical union with
other atoms-no more adventuring through
space-nothing but diamond atoms to the very
end of time of this cx- insisted he was cer-
tain no one had ever heard of a carbon atom in

this crystallized state ever taking part in any
combinations or reactions the diamond condi-
tion was eternal

  a more staggering blow could not have been
dealt to me than the divulging of this startling
information i could not doubt its authenticity
for cx- was to be relied upon in stating only
what he knew to be absolute fact the situation
burst upon me with all its horrible significance
i was a prisoner bound and helpless i was a
much a prisoner here as i had been down in the
dismal region of coal it was true that there i
found myself in a cold gloomy environment while
here i was an object of beauty scintillating with
a profusion of dazzling colors in the brilliant sun-
light but a prisoner nevertheless-doomed to
spend an eternity of existence in merely looking
pretty

  and in my bitter anguish i almost cried out
aloud to think that i had even grumbled at
the monotonous routine of change and transfor-
mation during my all-too-short period as an or-
dinary carbon atom to me that life had then
appeared as the very epitome of boredom and
how i now longed for a chance to go back and
resume that carefree life of chemical change and
combination that dim and distant hope of ever
being anything but a carbon atom-that nebulous
dream of transmutation-was now more vision-
ary than ever i confided my brooding thoughts
to faithful cx- and he consoled me as best he
could

  transmutation-thats too far-fetched even
to think about now as for leaving this diamond
existence-well-perhaps i was a little too rash
in stating so confidently that we are destined to
stay forever as far as i have ever heard there
is not a single case on record where a carbon atom
ever left the diamond state once he entered it
but is that any reason for concluding that it can
never be done those marvelous humans- those
ingenious scientists to whom we owe our existence
in this synthetic diamond condition are capable
of almost anything it would not surprise me at
all if they should suddenly find some way for us
to relinquish our crystalline regularity and enter
into the same familiar combinations to which we
are accustomed and as for transmutation ill
take back what i just said about its being too far
fetched is there any reason to suppose that these
supreme wizards might not even be capable of
that at this very moment radium is undergoing
disintegration into other elements man has
never been able either to hasten or to retard that
process or to effect it in the case of other ele-
ments-but does that mean that he never can
in the future i shall be surprised at nothing
-even if man finds it possible to change you and
me into other atoms at will-or even to destroy
us completely

oblivion

this brings my simple narrative up to the pre-
sent time i have been in my diamond condition
for only a comparatively short period but it
seems ages already and i dont know how i am
ever going to endure the terrifying monotony of
this new existence the ambitious remarks of
an atomic

cx- have become empty platitudes they bore
me having assumed an attitude diametrically
opposed to his original belief in the permanence
of our diamond state he is supremely confident
of ultimate change his very insistence is becom-
ing annoying only a little while ago he con-
fided to me with trembling excitement that things
are going to happen very shortly he whispered
that the human scientists-the same ones who
had caused us to be transformed into diamond
-are engaging in the preparation of an elaborate
experiment with us the nature of this work is
very mysterious but it is something radically
new-something that has never been attempted
before

  how cx- can tell what these scientists are up
to i have no means of knowing many times be-
fore he has exhibited that rare intuition-or
whatever faculty you may call it-which has en-
abled him to project his consciousness out of the
realm of atomic existence and ascertain the trend
of events in other spheres to only a negligible
degree have i ever possessed that ability but
cx- it seems can tell instantly what these learn-
ed men are planning read their thoughts fathom
their designs and anticipate their inventions

  nevertheless i am unable somehow to place
much stock in these new experiments cx- in-
sists that they are of momentous import but i
cannot bring myself around to any optimistic
thoughts about my own future whats the use
let them experiment with me  nothing matters
anyhow monotony-routine-boredom-ever-
lasting sameness-

  hello - whats that - rumblings-distant
rumblings-and getting louder each moment a
mysterious shudder runs through me-i feel my-
self impelled to vibrate more rapidly and i see
that my neighbors are trembling in a queer man-
ner the far-away rumblings are becoming more
pronounced-they have an awful sinister tone
that seems to tell of impending doom a convul-
sive wave of frenzied oscillation courses through
our ranks and then dies away in the distant
reaches of our domain

  what is that sudden shaft of searing yellowish
luminescence it plunges through our midst
with blinding brilliance that pales the rays of sun-
light pouring into us from all sides it is gone
now but it has left a wake of quivering atoms
behind there goes another one tearing through
our atomic ranks with reckless abandon a third
-a fourth-these devastating beams are hurtling
along in ever-increasing numbers

  crash one of these murderous shafts has just
struck an electron of my neighbor at my right
it was a glancing blow but the electron is reeling
dizzily in its orbit and the entire atom is trem-
bling violently through his entire structure an
increasing number of the surrounding atoms are
suffering more or less direct hits luckily i am
so far unscathed although i cannot overcome that

the

adventure	

contagious agitation that has taken possession of
me

  cx- is saying something to me the din of
these crashing messengers of destruction is over-
whelming-i cannot understand what my friend
is trying to tell me he is extremely excited-
so am i-so is everyone of us throughout the en-
tire diamond structure rays-scientists-trans-
mutation-destruction- i cannot make out any
sensible message in this incoherent babble

  e ectrons-hundreds of them - pi unging
crazily in all directions what is the meaning of
this they are unattached-free-flying through
space in straight lines-not in uniform circular
orbits

  ah now i see it i see it-they are being
torn away from our carbon atoms transmuta-
tion at last-just like the radium atoms i watch-
ed many ages ago but no-this is something
more-horror of horrors-my fellow atoms are
being disrupted-broken up this is not trans-
mutation -this is no mere change into new ele-
ments 

  oh-father of atoms-im being torn asunder
-electrons-my electrons-dont go-stay with
me oh they are being ripped out of my very
structure one-two-five of them have torn
from my side cx--cx- where are you-
look-your electrons too-leaving you-gone-
see-your nucleus-its breaking up-exploding
-flying protons-flying electrons-oh cx-
what has become of you-theres nothing left of
you-youre gone-blotted out-destroyed

  and i-oh the pain-the anguish-will this
ever end-rip-crash oh-my nucleus-my
protons-save me oh merciful creator i im slip-
ping im dying-darkness-oblivion-

   

  the learned scientist peered through his in-
strument and then raised his head with a sigh
he turned a knob on the box-like mechanism be-
fore him the intense yellowish beam of light
crackling from a glowing lens that fitted a tiny
aperture faded away into nothingness with his
almost immobile face betraying the very faintest
suggestion of a smile he turned slowly to a group
of men standing close by the strange instrument
awe wonder bewilderment was written on their
countenances-as though they had just witnessed
a supernatural manifestation or the work of a
powerful strange deity

  you see my dear professors said the learned
scientist suavely even the impossible can be
accomplished transmutation of elements is
childs play compared to what you have just seen
those synthetic diamond crystals that you watch-
ed me place on the focal tray of my apparatus are
gone-disintegrated-destroyed my ray has
broken up the carbon atoms into their component
parts and what have we as a result electricity
so much positive electricity and so much negative
electricity as shown on these galvanometers be-

rising to a sit-
ting position i
took the bone in
both hands and
struck like light-
ning

awing turned carls head-the crumpled
wing of a fantasmas moth an amateur
collector in port of spain island of trini-
dad had written that this supposedly phantom
species actually haunted an island in one of the
streams of the orinoco delta and carl had com-
missioned him to obtain a specimen at any cost
too bad carl was always chasing phantoms
to my chagrin and his unbounded gratification
however a real fantasmas moth finally arrived
in the mails poorly packed he told me over
the telephone yet somehow one whole wing came
through in almost perfect condition he wanted

me to rush right up to his bungalow

  itll look better by moonlight i procrastin-
ated bring it over this evening i had inter-
ests of my own and a dinner engagement be-

  shortly after dinner he arrived-bareheaded
and in shirtsleeves a handsome youngster if i
do say so with blue eyes and clean-cut features
he was twenty-six years old two years younger
than myself and since the death of our parents
we had lived apart but kept in daily touch with
each other fortunately we could afford to ride

mendelism-a much more important hobby i
thought

  what i most admired in carl was not his good
looks but bis splendid courage he feared noth-

always obliged myself regardless of conse-
quences to do the things i feared to do as a

go so i acquired a reputation for recklessness
but it was sham courage carls courage how-

could beat him at tennis yet he always got across

    very few writer possess the ability to combine in a single story a startling scientific idea a
strange atmosphere and a corking good yarn yet mr sutton has given us all these things in
this story with which he makes his bow to our readers

    our author is a prominent writer on scientific matters on the pacific coast and he assures us
that the atmosphere that makes this story so thrilling comes from personal experiences of his in out-
of-the-way comers of the globe

     as to his scientific ideas they are well-known yet the full significance of them has never proper-
ly dawned on us since gregor mendel an obscure monk gave to the world his studies on heredity
we have learned somewhat the why of individual family and racial characteristics from his studies
of interbreeding of plants mendel found how two living forms interact and he worked out laws to
tell us what sort of physical and mental characteristics we might expect when two species breed
the whole subject is intensely interesting and with it we can trace the degeneration of such beings
as the russian dog-man and the loup-garou as well as the production of our greatest geniuses

wonder stories quarterly

screw my courage up the stories of adventure
through which i thrilled hardly interested him
at all for he could see nothing unusual in heroic
behavior why should blood brothers be so dif-
ferent why should a shuffling sound outside
the door at night shake the pencil in my hand
when carl was deaf to such silly sounds

  these questions were running through my
mind while he unwrapped the little black box
wherein on milkweed cotton he had placed the
remains of the moth to one form of fear ap-
parently he was not immune-the fear that his
trembling fingers might injure the specimen

  stay where you are he said until im
ready then turn off the lights that was one
of your bright ideas henry moonlight bgosh
with a pair of forceps he took the wing to the
open window held it in the moonlight tilted it at
varying angles to bring out different reflections

  now douse the glim he exclaimed and tell
me what its like

  well it looks like a fan of golden smoke all
right but its just a wing a
dead insects wing a bit
crumpled beautiful enough
in its queerness i suppose

listen to me carl theres
beauty in living things dont

you know

 i know what youre
thinking he broke in cold-
ly but if it takes-all the
rest of my life and money

im going to have a perfect
specimen and i might afc
well tell you right now m
leaving tomorrow for fan-
tasmas island he threw
the wing out of the window
and held out his hand

  exasperated i dropped in-
to a chair and railed at him
told him the orinoco delta
reeked with miasmas raved
about strangler-trees and
murder fishes and jaguars

  why should i be afraid
to go where other people go he asked in that
daring way of his all the same im sailing to-
morrow how about a drink

  of course of course i stammered weakly
for the moment he mentioned not being afraid
i realized my objections were the natural reac-
tions of fear i had fancied myself in his place
and spoken impulsively to save my face i
agreed that if he valued the moths so highly
why the thing to do was to go get them but it
was hard work to say so for i had a premonition
that this good-looking brother of mine would
never return from the damnable trip

overwhelming fear

a cablegram from carl telling me he had
arrived in port of spain and chartered a
sailing boat to take him over to the delta was
followed by silence which seemed more and more
ominous as the weeks went by i finally went to

his bungalow and in his letter files found the
name of the amateur collector-charlie wilkins
-and cabled but his reply made matters worse
fishermen on the gulf of paria it said saw the
boat cross the bar at the mouth of the pedemales
river one of the streams into which the orinoco
splits before reaching the sea but it had not
since been sighted

   two weeks later a frightful cablegram came
   zambo sam master of the boat your brother
   chartered has returned without him says he landed
   him on fantasmas island which the natives call
   haunted island because its supposed to be haunted
   by ghosts of the pirates that anciently resorted there
   says your brother was hunting for pirates treasure
   when sumpin whiffed him away thats all the infor-
   mation i can get out of the superstitious zambo he
   will be here a week wire instructions

-charlie wilkins

   i was stunned carl either killed or aban-
doned a haunted island wire instruc-
tions what was i to wire there was just
one message to send and the
words leaped red-hot into my
mind but go down there
myself flounder through
alligator wallows in furnace
heat inhaling tropical
fevers sumpin whiffed
him away what on earth
could those weird words
mean an island haunted
by ghosts an island of fan-
tasms digging for pirates
treasure the whole thing
sounded uncanny suppose
i went what good would it
do arrangements might
be made through the state
department for the amer-
ican consul to send a search
expedition a dozen things
might be done-from a safe
distance on the other hand
strangers could hardly be
expected to follow carls
footsteps into the dangerous
places he would be inclined to explore it was
up to me even if i did not go farther than port
of spain i could learn the facts at first hand
from zambo sam but he would be leaving in
a week no chance of seeing him

   an airplane roaring over the city suggested
a frightful possibility one might fly there in
time to talk with zambo sam-provided the
plane did not dive into the caribbean sea lind-
bergh flew to trinidad others also why
shouldnt i god the facte were hard to face
yet i faced them i took a drink of drugstore
whiskey locked up and drove to the glendale
airport for my first flight

   feeling braver than a lion although a bit be-
wildered i came to in the aviation field back of
port of spain and bargained with the pilot to
wait until he heard from me if zambo sam
had gone i meant to explore the delta from the
air then calling a cooly carriage i drove to
the address of charlie wilkins who lived with
the island

his mother on the edge of town a disappoint-
ing fellow with a downy mustache and a cough
he had learned nothing new sams still here
but hes going to sail tonight he said and that
was the best information he had despite his
nervousness and apparent indifference i invited
him at a price to go with me to the delta

  over there he exclaimed with more feel-
ing than i supposed he possessed why no one
comes back from the delta ask anybody
theres a sand-bar across the mouth of the river
and sams flat-bottomed boats the only one that
can cross it and sams just a zambo i told
your brother what people say about the ghosts
and everything you see he didnt come back
the best he would do was to go with me down
to the water front and point out sams boat-a
small two-masted schooner anchored among the
bumboats about a quarter of a mile offshore it
looked gallant enough in the afternoon sun its
sails all silver in the slanting light telling him
to wait i took a launch out to the boat

  it had a flat bottom all right and two dirty
sails-for the silver had vanished from them-
and on the deck sat a half dozen zambos play-
ing some sort of a game with nuts they were
nearly naked big brawny fellows with rings in
their ears and knives in their belts-the most
mongrel humans i had ever seen being a stu-
dent of mendelism i knew that zambos were the
offspring of renegade negroes and jungle indians
two breeds which blend badly but i had no idea
how far back reversion could carry human be-
ings the aspect of these fellows was startling
they resembled apes more than men human
mules and mules i remembered were stub-
born animals

  i asked for captain sam and up rose the
throwback de luxe his knees bent his flat feet
wide apart his big mouth open

  im henry haveland i began as confidently
as possible it was my brother you took to fan-
tasmas island what happened to him  

  he tried to speak but simply stuttered for it
was fear that made the effort i knew the signs
in all his stutterings i could distinguish only a
string of silly words voices    sombras   
lemures  black wings  vampires    whis-
pers  moanson other subjects he talked
quite intelligently but whenever i recurred to
carls disappearance ten thousand years of sup-
erstition shivered through his brain feeling my
own knees weakening i said sam i want you
to take me to fantasmas island and bring me
back

  he shook his head violently

  whats the matter with you i snapped
jerking the machete from his belt he hurled
it the length of the boat and buried the point in a
plank no wider than the space between ones
eyes me cant do that to spirits bass so talk
no more bout island

  wherere you going from here

  up river by pednaly not by island

  knowing that pedernales village pednaly as
he called it was on the east bank of the river
diagonally across from the island will you take

of terror	

me there and wait until i return then bring me
back here i shouted at him

  he turned to the crew and barked at them
judging by their manner the jig was up but
finally sam faced about with the proposition that
for eight hard dollars a day some sow belly
and a sack of brown sugar he would take me
to pedernales remain there as long as i wished
and bring me back provided i agreed in the
presence of the port officer not to ask him to
sail near the island i was also to furnish my
own bed and board deposit the money with the
port officer to be paid over upon his return with
or without me and if by any chance i managed
to get across from pedernales to the island he
would not be expected to look for me nor to wait
longer than ten days he wanted to sail as soon
as possible in order to cross the sand-bar at high
tide next morning so it was settled-all but
the ordeal in the office of the port

  the port officer had a good deal to say the
pedernales is a river of death he volunteered
annoyingly whoever goes down never comes
up murder fishes electric eels sharks alliga-
tors better change your mind mr haveland
before its too late that haunted island say
sams right a dozen persons have gone over
there since ive been in charge of the portto hunt
for buried gold and none came back of course
your brother

  for heavens sake man get busy i inter-
rupted in a way that must have offended him
without further warning he wrote down my
name address and next of kin and made a re-
cord of my appearance five feet eleven inches
tall blue eyes light complexion a slight scar un-
der right eye dressed in hunting togs nervous
disposition and so on

  that business over i scribbled a note to the
airplane pilot telling him not to wait any longer
and sent it by charlie wilkins then purchased
quite a supply of provisions including the sow
belly and brown sugar and with sams help got
everything aboard and we sailed just before sun-
set

  and how we loped over the gulf of paria
like an old airedale with a bone in its mouth the
old boat galloped into the night trailing out a
wake of phosphorescence which glimmered
brighter than the wake of the tropic moon save
for the flapping of the patched sails the swishing
of the waves the whining of the wind the rum-
bling in the clouds and the crooning of the zam-
bos black silence reigned and a sleeping pow-
der put me to sleep

la blanca

sams toe in my ribs awoke me thanks to
the powder i had slept away the night and
the forenoon also

  pednaly town sam was saying

  it was a more primitive place than i expected
quite pitiably picturesque a row of mud buts
roofed with palm leaves the clay-covered river
in front and a solid wall of jungle behind-that

was pedernales the only human habitation on
the entire delta pointing over his shoulder
with his thumb f-f-fantasmas stuttered sam
not more than two miles away it looked like a
great floating mass of greenhouse vegetation
around feathery fronds which flickered like
flames in the sun bizarre birds swirled a
queer place indeed for one of carls accomplish-
ments to look for moths

  sam moored to the mangroves and i went
ashore what a relief to learn that the little
old mummy who stood in the doorway of the
hut over a venezuelan rag-of-a-flag fluttered
spoke a little english a mestizo he proved to
be in whose veins still flowed the blood of the
buccaneers that anciently frequented fantasmas
island of course the spanish blood had been
mostly bred out but he had still his pedigree
and therefore his pride and petty pomposities
we bowed and scraped then sipping jamaica

hot under the lean-to where we sat on stools with
the flask between us although the heat had not
seemed so oppressive until he spoke of the loup-
garou

  in a confidential tone he went on call it
what you wish a vampires a ghost with a babys
body and a black angels wings it flies by night
and sucks warm blood my old eyes have seen
vampires too and he made a sign of the cross
it would be murder to give you a dugout even
if i should do so where would you find pad-
dlers

  pretending a courage i did not feel whats
the matter with paddling my own canoe i
asked

  waving his small hands toward the river
mira he exclaimed the rio pedernales is
always that way senor logs stumps drift-
wood on angry tides and under the tides-

rum from a flask which i produced we got down
to business what i wanted was a dugout i
had seen a whole fleet tied among the mangroves
as i came ashore to my surprise this hospi-
table host who had already piaced the best hut
in town at my disposal was shaking his head
and acting almost as queerly as sam had behaved
at length however the rum loosened his tongue
and he poured out a tale while almost took my
breath away before my father died he de-
clared with evident sincerity i paddled close to
fantasmas and saw a loup-garou si senor a
loup-garou the head of a man on the body of
a beast head hairy all over except the eyes
and nose and its the leader of a pack of wer-
wolves si senor werwolves you believe me
not it is truth we who live here know
know you what a vampire is

a b-a-t of course i stammered mopping
the perspiration from my face it was sizzling

takes two paddles in the hands of strong river-
men to cross pedernales

  until that moment i had hardly given the river
a glance i recalled having read that the tides
ran high on the delta and here they were be-
sides running high they were littered with the
debris of a vast watershed a wild clay-color-
ed river which seemed to be running inland as
it literally does when the tides are high but
yonder lay the island shimmering in the mist so
plainly in view here were dugouts and pad-
dlers was i to be balked after all jefe my
brother may still be alive id be a skunk to
turn back now what do you suggest

  your zambos of course they will not take
you ah senor fantasmas is taboo

  i did some pooh-poohing but it did not phase
him one might as well try to pooh-pooh saints
out of the christian religion in the very core
of his heart this mestizo headman believed the
the island

island was haunted by evil spirits no use argu-
ing i would have to wait awhile get better ac-
quainted i would spend the night here calm
down and trust to circumstances he arose and
opened the door of his hut beside which we had
been sitting and said bring your things ashore
my friend this casa is yours

  on the way to the boat i was amazed to see
a young white woman among the squaws on the
river bank having heard of white indians i
paused for a second look blonde hair brown
eyes dark lashes calved legs tanned skin per-
fect teeth had a yacht been wrecked and
this girl saved all the afternoon i wondered
about her and that evening while the jefe and
his corpulent spouse-she was three times his
size low-browed and coffee-colored-were en-
joying my canned stuff i asked about the white
girl girl sounded more modest than young
woman and i did not wish to appear specially
interested

  my granddaughter senor her father was
my son her mother a spotted mestizo both died
when she was very young

  her mother-spotted

  si senor white spots on her brown body la
manchanda we called her the nina we named
la blanca because she was all white she
spoke to his spouse whereupon that mountain of
flesh went to the door and shouted la blanca i
with hands on hips and head thrown back la
blanca came boldly and looked me level in the
eyes despite the jefes statement i still believed
there was not one drop of indian blood in her
veins nor were there any spots on her-she
was white a short skirt covered her hips and
legs but she wore nothing else except a string of
beads and the band which held her hair back
so i could see that her body was no darker than
that of an average caucasian brunette a boyish
body only rounder and finer muscled and her
feet were beautifully arched

  no speaks english said the jefe whose ex-
istence i had momentarily forgotten though
she understands a little in one month la blan-
ca will be married wish you to see her novio
later on perhaps and i motioned la blanca
to help herself to the provisions without the
least embarrassment she did so-tasted this and
that made faces at the sardines but licked the
honey  poured on a plate acting perfectly at
ease in my presence to show her appreciation
of the can of honey which i thrust into her hands
she took me on a sight-seeing tour of the town

the jungle terror

there were twelve huts all facing the river
a huge shed in the middle of the row
served as a market meeting place and social cen-
ter combined in it clay vessels hammocks fish
baskets and jungle products were displayed but
la blanca herself was a thousand times more in-
teresting than anything she pointed out all the
other females shrank bashfully in the back-
ground whereas she swaggered by my side and
although she spoke no english she plainly under-

of terror	

stood my questions and answered cleverly with
gestures and shrugs

  at the end of the row of huts where three
mop-headed men were penning up a pack of orn-
ery dogs she made a motion which caused my
flesh to creep the motion meant that the dogs
were being caged to keep the jaguars from car-
rying them off at night after going the
rounds she escorted me back to the hut and
showed me how to bar the door as to the one
window it was only a v-shaped slit in the thick
wall-hardly wide enough to admit a man-eater

  meanwhile i had been making plans and as
soon as she left the hut i went aboard the boat
and instructed sam to go among the mestizos
and promise two bottles of rum to any two pad-
dlers who would take me over to the island early
next morning instead of protesting he grinned
like an ape did he think there would be no tak-
ers or was he willing to send mestizos to the
ghosts fancying the rum would do the trick i
gathered together such things as one might need
for a day on an uninhabited island took them to
my hut shaved washed brushed up and went
to dine with the jefe

  around a hand-made table we sat down on
benches the jefe two squaws six papooses la
blanca and myself besides the jug of wine
which i contributed the meal consisted of cas-
sava cakes a savory stew and a salad served on
banana leaves hurrying through the dinner i
took the jefe by the arm and led him into my
hut

  now look here my friend i began nervous-
ly i think youve been spoofing me-about your
granddaughter and ghosts youre a gentleman
with white blood in your veins and you speak my
language im your guest i have eaten your
cakes and you have sipped my wine i want
you to tell me the truth about la blanca

  amazement in his manner why my friend
ive told you the truth her father was my son
her mother la manchanda that is all

  was he lying or had someone perpetrated a
hoax on him  in either event there was no use
pressing him farther pardon me for doubting
you i replied its a strange case but there
seem to be many mysteries on the delta now
about a dugout i must have one jefe

  like all men who have backgrounds and an-
cestors and memories the jefe had pride and
to his pride i had appealed but with pride came
pain then weakness shaking his head nun-
ca nunca he murmured if i sent paddlers
with you they would come back without you it
is impossible fantasmas is taboo and with all
the dignity of a hidalgo this shadow of the spain
that used-to-be gathered up the shawl which sag-
ged from his shoulder bade me good night and
backed out of the hut

  for awhile i stood in the doorway-listening
the sun had set and the jungle was waking
strange sounds were in the air-whines yelps
howls and growls until now i had not felt
much fear of the jungle it was right behind
the huts but by day it had been strangely silent
now with the darkness deepening it seemed tc
be seething with-no telling what even at
	wonder stories quarterly

home i remembered startling at the sound of
rustling leaves but these noises in front of the
huts an old squaw was putting out the torches so
i closed and barred the door laid out a revolver
dropped into the hammock and listened the air
was hot and humid and a feeling of nausea kept
me awake i knew i was safe even in this un-
caged menagerie yet at every yowl my heart
skipped a beat yowling there was yowling
all around and these yowlers were jaguars
worse still an unearthly chorus suddenly shiv-
ered through the air rising higher and higher
until the whole jungle throbbed with sound then
it dropped down slowly an octave at a time and
finally ended as a sort of moan having heard
about howling monkeys i realized they were
howling their night song but i never imagined it
could be so outlandish time and again the un-
canny rhythm rose into a roar and moaned off
into silence-always from different directions
for the howlers were always trooping

  to quiet my nerves i went to the window and
looked out the river also was roaring but the
moon had not come up and i could see nothing
but black mist the dogs however were si-
lent-scared stiff perhaps as to the haunted is-
land-so long as i had done my level best-but
had i exhausted every possibility there was
sam despite my promise i might bully him into
sailing me over la blanca-no use trying to
think coherently on any subject under such crazy
conditions i took a light sleeping powder
washed it down with a gulp of rum stretched out
upon the hammock without undressing and fin-
ally dozed off

  toward morning a stick which someone thrust
through the window brought me to my feet
holding my breath i tip-toed to the window the
night seemed serenely beautiful now for the
moon had risen and quieted the jungle la
blanca it was she

  sh-sh she was saying with a finger to her
lips

  i opened the door she motioned me to gath-
er up my belongings and loaded like a pack
horse i followed her to a cove where the dugouts
were moored two shadows stood among the
mangroves zambo sam and a long-armed low-
browed mestizo

  hims juan sam grinned la blancas
promised him and her paddle you to island
and he held up an empty bottle which had over-
come juans fear of ghosts

  it seemed like a dream yet here we were-
shoving off now the importance of two pad-
dlers became apparent for the dugout being
simply a dead trees shell careened crazily and
took water at every turn making matters
worse about the time we reached the middle of
the stream juan began to act queerly instead
of stroking steadily he skipped strokes strok-
ing intermittently on one side until prompted by
la blanca he would lurch heavily to the oppo-
site side and repeat the performance when at
length the terrible truth dawned upon me fear
in its most sickening form took possession of me
he was drunk passing out and taking two
white people with him all my life i had cringed

at the feel of fishes now to be dumped into a
river from which no one emerges to be devoured
piecemeal by murder fishes when right yonder
lay the island with the rising sun shimmering on
green leaves-at that moment fear made me
more dangerous than juan for i was foolish
enough to think it possible to heave a drunken
mestizo to the sharks without overturning the
dugout la blanca fortunately rose first one
hand upon my shoulder she poised her paddle in
air shouted huy at the top of her voice and
as juan swayed from one side to the other she
struck-and down he settled in the bottom of the
dugout i caught the paddle which fell from
his hands but la blanca motioned me to bail
water with my hat and somehow she managed
to paddle into the lee of the island

chapter v
smoke

an impenetrable hedge of mangroves sur-
rounded the island save at the extreme
north end where the tides had swept back the
vegetation from a beautiful little crescent-shaped
beach back of the beach rose a barricade of
driftwood brought down the river and piled up
by the tides and behind the barricade the jungle
loomed a beautiful eden-in morning splen-
dor swaying fronds flaming wings chattering
monkeys flowering vines fragrant odors dew-
covered webs shimmering everywhere long-
legged wading birds made way for the dugout
and we stepped ashore on fantasmas island
despite the beauty of the place its prehistoric as-
pect was a bit appalling it was as if we had
drifted back in time and space to an eocene jun-
gle for this island had plainly come down the
centuries unchanged forgotten by evolution
flowerless trees covered with blooms but the
blossoms did not belong to the trees they be-
longed to the vines or lianas it was borrowed
beauty the greenhouse flora sighing in the
breeze and shimmering in the sun was literally
as antique as the alligators lying beneath the
mangroves with their snouts on the land in such
an antediluvian scene human beings would na-
turally feel out of place even the beach seemed
to undulate under my feet probably because i
had not yet completely recovered my land-legs
nowhere however was there a single thing to
fear and what a relief that was-after our close
call on the river

  we tied the dugout to a bush and la blanca
proceeded to bathe juans head then she ran
here and there stopping suddenly to examine
some particular bush or weed was she botan-
izing finding the weed she wanted she
squeezed its juice over juans bump showing
more solicitude than seemed necessary under the
circumstances i removed the things from the
dugout placed them in the sun to dry and re-
connoitered

  there were no human tracks in the sand it
was evident however that the denizens used the
beach as a playground or perhaps a fighting
ground for the signs of paws and claws appeared
the island of terror

everywhere there were paths across the sand
which looked as if a carcass had been dragged
over the surface but it seemed more likely that
the flat furrows had been made by prowling al-
ligators

  climbing to the top of the barricade i exper-
ienced a happy thrill for through the foliage i
caught a glimmering of smoke although the
jungle had commenced to steam this thin spiral
curling upward from a bush-covered mound
about a stones throw from the barricade could
not be steam or mist it could not be anything
but smoke a tiny cloud hovered among the
tree-tops whose branches overhung the mound

smoke so carl must still be alive i whistled
shouted listened

no response just
jungle silence accen-
tuated by murmurings
of insects the sighing of
the wind queer creak-
ings and queerer twit-
terings cupping my
hands i yelled carl

carl where are you

the titterings now
sounded louder more
uncanny like the sub-
dued gigglingsone hears
when visiting an insane
asylum these titter-
ings were not continu-
ous they would rise
and fall and break out
again apparently from
another direction it
was as difficult to locate
the source as to locate a
cricket by its song be-
cause of the human note
in the sound an absurd
question leaped into my
mind could carl have
lost his reason save
for the gentle swaying
of fronds nothing seem-
ed to be moving yet the
thing from whose throat
those titterings came

must surely be moving actua plctnre of adrian jeftlchjew-me russian do man
loula tne sounds come this is from lulls organic evolution he is an example ot a real
from those heads ftorow-tock t a decnerate etae-

hanging hair no the hair on those heads
was nothing but roots-the roots of epiphytes
growing on limbs which gathered their nourish-
ment from the dank air feeling the chills
crawling up my back i beckoned to la blanca

  whiter faced than ever she climbed the bar-
ricade and confirmed my opinion as to the
smoke at least she nodded her head to my
surprise she signified a willingness to go with me
to the mound and it was she that led the way
-on hands and knees so dense was the vege-
tation that we had to crawl regardless of snakes
at the end of the crawl we found ourselves on
the top of the mound-staring into the tiny crater
of a mud volcano it was spitting bubbles of



 liquid asphalt and emitting little puffs of smoke

   what a let-down a laughing matter we
 had crawled through a tangle of thorny vines
 expecting to find a smoldering campfire and
 here was this the next moment we were bend-
 ing over a track at which we did not smile a
 frightful footprint hauntingly human yet mon-
 strous for only the ball of the foot and two large
 toes had made an impression in the moist soil

 a zig-zag series of similar tracks extended down
 the moundside and along with them were others
 made by big knuckled fists no use blinking the
 facts-these footprints and handprints were posi-
 tively bizarre it was as if an urang-utan had
 waddled down the mound yet i well knew no
 anthropoid apes inhabited the delta

                             out of the hole

                    expressing my sii-

                         blanca she insisted
                         upon returning at once s
                         to the beach and i
                         made no effort to re-

                         i courage did not
                         oblige a man to take up
                         the trail of the beast no
                         difference how man-
                         like its tracks might be
                         back on the beach how-
                         ever i felt rather fool-
                         ish i could not get
                         those outlandish foot-
                         prints out of my mind
                         they were tangible evi-
                         dence that something
                         which came close to the
                         jefes description of the
                         loup-garou was at
                         large on the island and
                         with it at large one had
                         better be on guard i
                         tried waking juan but
                         he remained dead to
                         the world the bump
                         on his head did not mat-
                         ter he was just sleeping
                         off his rum what did
                         matter was that thing
                         yet for manhoods sake i had to pretend to be
                         unconcerned on my own account as well as la
                         blancas

    not for worlds after my sit-still-and-do-noth-
 ing behavior in the dugout would i have her
 suspect my mortifying trepidation i wanted to
 show her as well as to make myself believe that
 white men were ready to face anything no use
 walking the beach however waiting for some-
 thing to turn up the day would not last for-
 ever and i must find out what had happened to
 carl according to zambo sam he was dig-
 ging for pirates treasure when sumpin whiffed
 him away but if the ruins of a buccaneers
 abode existed within this impenetrable jungle
	wonder stories quarterly

how was ft to be located one could not walk
along the waters edge because of the man-
groves standing on stilt-like roots the man-
groves extended from the jungle wall into deep
water and only god knew what caused the
black waters to seethe and swirl among the stilts

  as if suspecting my thoughts la blanca
climbed the barricade sprang into a tree and
wormed her way through the vines to the top
then after looking around she stared awhile in-
tently in a southeasterly direction and called to
me climbing more clumsily i finally emerged
through the vine-covered canopy and described
in the leafy distance what looked like the ruins of
an ancient chimney-so mutely reminiscent of
buccaneers it would be there that carl was
digging are you game i asked and la
blanca not only nodded her high-held head but
again led the way

  the distance was not more than two or three
hundred yards yet it took nearly an hour by my
watch for us to crawl through the barbed wire
entanglements on that stretch of no mans land
it would have taken longer if la blanca had not
found a furrow made by alligators through the
thickest and thorniest vegetation reaching the
ruins at length it was abvious that they had been
recently visited because on one side the vines
had been torn loose revealing adobe bricks the
visitor had evidently wondered just as i was
wondering whether this pile of foliage might not
be another mound on the other hand the
vines might have been torn from the bricks by
the jefes loup-garou in all my calculations
the creature that made the man-like tracks now
had a place too big a place i was constantly
on the lookout for the thing itself it might have
chosen these ruins for a lair

  la blanca i called she had rummaged
around to the other side of the tower la blan-
ca no answer just seething silence not
a titter anywhere

  around the tower i tore through the vines
yelling at the top of my voice whiffed away
my god right where carl had vanished la
blanca

  this time there was an answer-a peal of
laughter from the tree under which i was stand-
ing i whirled round and beheld-her she
was pointing toward a pile of debris which had
been shoveled from a floor between two crum-
bled walls to the eastward of the tower the
joy of seeing her sitting alive on the limb over-
came the surprise that pile of hand-handled deb-
ris would have otherwise inspired so i simply
shook my fist at her and floundered through the
damnable vines not even the pick and shovel-
which lay beside the diggings brought me back
to earth completely the rains had coated the
tools with rust but they were plainly quite new
for the port of spain labels remained in place
carls tools right here they had fallen from
his hands all this i realized yet i had hardly
recovered from the fright she gave me what
if she had been whiffed away but she was
safe so long as she sat on the limb

  an upraised slab of rotting concrete on the
opposite side of the pile of debris made me for-

get la blanca it had been pried up and stood
edgewise the size of it a sort of trapdoor
obviously this trapdoor in the floor opened into
a cellar or possibly a treasure vault a naus-
eating smell emanated from the square hole and
kept me from looking directly into it at a slant
however the subterranean chamber appeared as
dark as midnight for the foliage shaded the
hole and there was evidently no other opening
through which even dim light could reach the
stinking interior holding my nose i poked
down into the gloom with the shovel then la
blanca screamed she screamed just in time to
save me from a huge hissing head which boomed
out of the hole an anaconda that much i
realized the moment the gleam of its eyes met
mine and i caught the gleam just as la blanca
screamed it was the scream however and not
the gleam that made me leap sideways for there
was a fascinating power in those evil eyes which
would have held me an instant too long if she
had not screamed having leaped i looked-
saw the horrible head settle back into the hole-
and turned toward la blanca my god i
would show her how grateful i was to her for
keeping watch in some way i would show her
she was not there on the limb where she had
been sitting there was nothing but a few shreds
from her skirt under the limb however i found
her lying unconscious on the ground had she
fainted and fallen naturally what woman
would not i picked her up as tenderly as pos-
sible carried her to a wild lily pool and dashed
her white face with water but instead of recov-
ering calmly she awoke in a frenzy of fear the
marks on her shoulders had been scratched i
supposed by the bark on the limb as she fell
but she quickly convinced me they had been made
by the claws of a beast which her trembling
hands pictured in frightful proportions

the werwolves

only one shoulder was marked-four black
and blue lines on one side one line on the
other-as if a hand had closed over the should-
der certainly the scratches looked more like
nail-marks than claw-marks the thing its
purpose had been to carry her away but her
frantic efforts had broken the grip if it had
seized her by the hair or throat her struggles
would have been vain no human hand how-
ever could have clung to a bare shoulder es-
pecially a hand reaching down through the foli-
age at any rate la blanca was still safe and
my mission was accomplished poor carl no
one had been present to scream when the ana-
conda struck at him a horrible death snapped
up and dragged down that loathsome hole then
swallowed slowly alive yet the fate la blanca
had so narrowly escaped seemed even more
hideous

  come on i said and we crawled back to that
blessed little beach

  after washing our hands and faces la blanca
opened my pack of provisions and i walked the
beach wondering whether my mission was really
accomplished or not when carl pried up the
the island of terror	

slab the anaconda could not have been in the
cellar i reasoned for there was no way in which
a serpent as big around as a mans body could
have entered the anaconda had obviously se-
lected the cellar as its lair since the opening of
the trapdoor so i was back at the starting point

  it was afternoon and i had learned nothing
definite should i give up return to pedernales
and sail for home every craven nerve in my
body wanted to leave at once and i knew why
i was afraid to remain yet if i should cross over
with la blanca and juan there would be no pos-
sible way for me to get back to the island juans
sore head la blancas frightful experience on
top of the fact that i had violated the jefes hos-
pitality would harden the old headmans heart
so if i were to do any more investigating i must
remain overnight and take chances on la blanca
or sam coming over tomorrow to take me off a
terrible alternative in a thick-walled peder-
nales hut i had heard the jungle roar at night
and those horrible howls still rang like deathbells
in my ears here there would be no hut no one
to call to no protection whatever a sickening
situation yet it had to be faced-by a coward
who wanted to be brave

  like gypsies we lunched although i was not
in a picnicking mood la blanca however had
completely recovered her composure right af-
ter the lunch she assumed we would be paddling
for pedernales if she liked the stuff in the cans
she bolted it otherwise spat it out a wonder-
woman physically but as unconventional as a
child plucking a hair from my head she
matched it with one of hers and showed me that
they were two of a kind then because i would
not let her lick the scratches on my arms and
hands she pretended to pout until i finally per-
mitted her to wipe the perspiration from my
forehead to tell the truth she cooled my face
with what was left of the white wine in her tin-
cup suddenly dropping the towel she threw
her arms around my neck wailing werwolves
werwolves

  there they were squatted on their tails in a
semi-circle not more than a hundred yards away
grimly watching us nineteen all told high in
the shoulders low in the hind-quarters russet
colored grim and gaunt they were indeed as
werwolfish as it would be possible for canines to
become thanks to my mendelian studies how-
ever i knew at a glance that they were just de-
generate dogs the slave-hunting bloodhounds
brought over by the buccaneers had gone wild
with jungle canines and these ferocious ferals
were the descendants throwback hounds no
doubt about it

  back down the ladder of dog evolution these
creatures had descended to the level where jack-
als dholes dingos pariahs wolves and wild dogs
were brothers-just as wheat on abandoned
farms reverts to the grotesque grasses from which
wheat evolved ferocious naturally for here in
the haunts of dog-eating alligators and pythons
they had held their own so far as numbers were
concerned but paid in terms of reversion how
had they kept alive for two centuries pack or-
ganization and pack patriotism no doubt de-

spite their savage aspect however they showed
no inclination to attack us why were old in-
stincts stirring in the backs of their wild brains
were they sub-consciously remembering their
masters in no other way could i account for
their behavior staring at us as intently as we
stared at them now and then they would raise
their noses and yawn but not one bark came out
that yawning gesture seemed to be nothing more
than an inherited habit-canine homage to her-
edity like the turning round habit of domestic
dogs before lying down-for obviously these
throwbacks were dumb nineteen dumb dogs
staring at the kind of creatures that still lived in
their dreams

  la blanca regarded them with fascinated ter-
ror yet when i stepped forward she went with
me and laughed to see the dogs back into the
bushes when we retreated they crouched for-
ward and retreated again every time we ad-
vanced it was like a game but now i saw with
alarm there was a jaguar looking on

the battle in the brake

ordinarily jaguars slept by day but this
was no ordinary occasion the reminiscent
smell of human beings must have disarranged
feline as well as canine psychology for at a
greater distance the jaguar was behaving just as
strangely as the dogs in a less friendly way it
stalked out upon the long horn of the crescent
beach stopping occasionally to glare at the dogs
and at us a beautiful beast lips throat breast
and belly snow white with black spots head
back and sides a rich tan with black rosettes
certainly something had turned the head of this
teitor of the trees otherwise it would not have
left the jungle to prowl along that treeless lick
of land something must have made it forget its
cunning for what chance had it against the
pack of course it could shake the life out of
one dog as easily as a house-cat shakes the life
out of a mouse but how did it dare defy the
power of the pack

  i glanced at la blanca she was standing be-
side me rigidly erect her hand on my arm be-
neath her breath she muttered something in her
tongue and nodded she seemed to be expect-
ant rather than afraid at that moment how-
ever a fiendish peal of laughter resounded from
the bushes back of the dogs and i felt her fingers
tighten on my arm

  that hyena laughter was plainly a call to the
pack as if galvanized the dogs whirled round
bounded into the bushes and reappeared on the
trail of the jaguar led by a creature which looked
like a man in the skin of a gorilla like a gor-
illa it galumphed along a club in one hand the
other hand now and then touching the ground
the line passed rapidly between us and the sun
which was dazzling bright and i fancied the
glare must have exaggerated the grotesqueness
of the thing so fascinated was i that i hardly
gave the jaguar a thought until it turned it
turned glared toward the pack for just one
moment then raced in a series of long leaps not
out toward the end of the horn but toward the
	wonder stories quarterly

bend which brought it in our direction before
it reached the bend the dogs had it surrounded
it backed into a bamboo brake and stood at bay
then around the circle of dogs the ape-like leader
loped continuing that lunatic laughter he was
obviously having his fun in advance of the fight-
ing

  the jaguar made one further attempt to es-
cape it sprang from the brake bowled dogs to
right and left and made the mistake of seizing
one by the backbone for that dog twisted round
and fastened its fangs in the jaguars throat
shaking it loose the jaguar leaped back into the
brake and whirled again at bay now the
leaders laughter changed to a hoarse staccato
which was plainly a call to the kill for the
younger dogs fell back and the grimmer ones
closed in

  the affray was nearly noiseless no barking
or yelping on the part of the pack-just guttural
growls and dogged determination no whinings
or calls for help from the bamboo brake-just
hissings and out-flashings of paws which
sprawled one of the dogs on the ground but the
death of that dog maae no impression on the
pack nor on the jumping-jack leader the leader
laughed louder arid the melee began when it
ended the jaguar and two dogs were dead but
what did the leader care for the loss of two
dogs after pounding the skull of the dead cat
awhile with his club he galumphed back into
the jungle alone while the dogs came forward
to stare at us and lick their wounds

  to me the finest thing in all the fight was not
the display of jungle fury not the slavering
mouths and gleaming teeth not even the jaguars
desperate defense but the devil-may-care cour-
age with which these dumb dogs did their duty
whether they feared the jaguar or not they
faced it and fought regardless of consequences
to themselves god knows i needed just such an
example to stiffen my backbone for the time
had come to decide whether to return to peder-
nales or to remain overnight

  as to the loup-garou i had formed an opinion
which took some of the terror out of the idea of
spending the night on the island instead of be-
ing a supernatural monster with the head of a
man on the body of a beast he was simply an
atavistic man a gorilla-like throwback in whom
reversion had done its worst a much more ex-
treme throwback indeed than zambo sam or
even the russian dog-man or the porcupine man
pictured in books on mendelism because of his
frightful physiognomy some jungle judge had
probably banished him to this forsaken island
where he had lost his reason-if he ever had any
reason at any rate he was flesh and blood
a bullet in his hairy head would put an end to
his lunatic laughter if he became too much of a
menace a powerful lunatic running at large
he might be responsible for carls disappear-
ance one would have to be on watch every
moment

  for fear i might change my mind i took la
blanca by the hand and earnestly tried to tell
her my decision she and juan must leave at
once to reach pedernales before dark did she

understand we walked down to the dugout
finding juan half awake dazed and irritable
he fancied i had whacked him on the head to
further the fancy i picked up a paddle and
threatened to use it again unless he left at once
it took a lot of loud talking and gesticulating
but i finally made them both understand as
white as the lilies in the pool beside the anacon-
das lair la blanca stared at me sorrowfully and
admiringly she seemed to think i was doing
something brave beyond words when she com-
prehended that i wished her and juan or sam
or anybody to come across for me tomorrow
morning she turned abruptly stepped into the
dugout thrust a paddle in juans hands and
shoved off as the dugout took the waves she
turned her face and i swear there were tears in
her eyes she probably thought she was seeing
me for the last time

chapter iv
alone

as the dugout disappeared amid the mist and
undulating driftwood a feeling of unutter-
able loneliness welled up in me was i here
alone definitely isolated from mankind or was

i	dreaming nothing seemed real oh the
alienness of this island an age of reptiles
island marooned yes marooned with a iriur-
derous throwback who had tried to abduct la
blanca alive over the sighing tree-tops more
silent now than at any time during the day a
smothering atmosphere of unreality hung even
the sun sinking slowly into the hazy jungles on
the western side of the river looked like a huge
angry eye one could hardly see it however be-
cause of the wings wings which flamed like
fire for the red ibis were flocking to the island
to roost and here i was-stranded for the
night a wild walpurgis night probably
stranded possibly for all time why should i
presume to believe la blanca or anyone would
come over for me  what was i to these people 
the jefe had warned me he would shrug his
sloping shoulders and sigh the truth i told him
and he would not believe as to sam had i
not formally agreed in the port officers pres-
ence that he was not expected to look for me or
to wait longer than ten days well night was
coming on no use maundering around like a
sick moon-calf i must prepare for night the
clammy feel of it was already in the air de-
spite nostalgia weak-knees and nauseating odors
from along the barricade i must buck up and
build a fire one could at least start a fire it
would keep man-eaters at bay and ghosts would
avoid the light and if carl were yet alive he
would see it

  humming a dreary dirge to keep my courage
up i dragged an ample supply of driftwood from
the barricade started a fire made a pot of cof-
fee and dined on the remnants of the lunch
then amid a dazzling display of orange yellow
and red colors the sun dropped out of sight and
here i sat in the thickening gloom watching the
stars shimmer out and listening to the croaking
the island

of frogs the grunting of alligators the creaking
of foliage freshening for the night and the slith-
ering sounds behind the barricade

  it was a moonless light yet the dogs were vis-
ible like hulking shadows they stalked out of
the bushes and flattened themselves on the beach
somewhat nearer than they had ventured during
the day their presence made me feel a bit more
secure the jungle was becoming noisy but the
sounds were less alarming than i had anticipated
perhaps because escape was impossible i was
cornered on a barren beach between the jungle
and river all the same i tried to make myself
believe i was conquering fear howling mon-
keys pooh i had heard them howl before

  the first time my heart skipped a beat was
when something fanned my face a wide-winged
something blacker than the night which i
glimpsed as it vanished a few minutes later
it returned hovered for a time overhead then
as noiselessly as a shadow volplaned away what
a relief it was only a bat one of the jefes
vampires a blood-sucking bat however so i
had better not fall asleep when flock of
wings fluttered into view i picked up a stick
and waited but these creatures were not bats
they were moths wide-winged wonders almost
as big as vampire bats fantasmas moths how
carl must have thrilled if they gyrated like this
around his campfire to see them singe their
velvety wings brought back that sickly sensation
but this time it was not caused by fear i still
had control of my nerves and proved it by point-
ing a finger steadily at a star yes i seemed to
have myself in hand

  the next moment however a loud peal of
lunatic laughter right behind the barricade made
my damned hair rise on end tittering off into
silence it left me limp mortified panicky why
carl would have laughed back at the lunatic

  to recover control of my tingling nerves i
walked around the fire breathed the damp air
deeply beat my breast tried to mimic the titter-
ings and felt ashamed of the weakness of my
voice it was torture to have to pretend to be
brave to have to fight down this inborn craven-
ness especially when i had almost convinced my-
self that i could control myself in the midst of
my forced bravado i caught the glimpse of
something so black that it looked like a shadow
in the moonless night sliding along the barri-
cade revolver in hand i might easily have
shot it or have frightened it away but i did not
think of shooting until it vanished

  putting fresh fuel on the fire i sat down on a
chunk of the driftwood and tried to reason my-
self into a saner sense of the situaton at the
worst this insane thing could be nothing but
an atavistic man as strong as a gorilla no
doubt yet an armed man on an open beach with
firelight to see by should not be afraid to face
even a gorilla the thing was naked and un-
armed aside from the advantage the revolver
gave me i had on hunting boots-pretty good
weapons in a scrimmage with a wild man more-
over i was conscious of my own strength

  twenty-eight years old a fair boxer and
wrestler i should be able to knock out this

of terror	

throwback thing bare-handed provided i had
the guts to stand up and fight like a white man
did i have the guts if the anthropoid thing
galumphed tittering at me would my knees
weaken and my shammed courage fail ghosts
voices nothing like a specter had material-
ized nor had i heard anything more voice-like
than the titterings of that half human thing it
was apparently the one thing to be feared with
the dogs on guard jaguars would keep to the
trees and alligators to their wallows and pos-
sibly the thing had no evil intentions it might
be moved by curiosity or feelings of loneliness
or a hankering for companionship thus far it
had only spied on me yet its spying must be
actuated by insane malice la blanca bless her
soul it had tried to carry her off and there
was sheer savagery in its laughter without a
tremor of humanity as hard and heartless as the
cachinnations of a blood-hungry hyena

the attack in the night

it was laughing again from somewhere back of
the dogs like the night song of howling mon-
keys the ear-splitting derision rose to a climax
and tittered off into silence a frightful ulula-
tion to come from any kind of a throat but this
time thank god my hair did not rise so pleased
was i that i laughed back involuntarily-hyster-
ically perhaps for it wa not easy to stop laugh-
ing let it come i had gotten over being afraid
of it annoyingly however it made no response
after listening in vain for more than an hour i
concluded it must have gone to its lair and began
thinking about sams voices and ghosts it was
midnight the hour ghosts supposedly walked but
where were the ghosts and where were those
voices to be true there were bushes which be-
haved queerly and whines which sounded like
wails but it would take something more substan-
tial to shake this new fine feeling of mine

  when the moon came up flooding island and
river with mellow light i found it possible to
whistle without a quiver for some reason how-
ever the dogs were acting restless as the moon
climbed higher among the trees they backed far-
ther away raised their hanging heads and
yawned they were obviously trying to bay the
moon-a pathetic homage to the moon-baying
hounds from which these dumb ferals had de-
scended feeling fully secure in the bright moon-
light i sat down and relaxed the only thing
that kept me from dozing was a feeling that i
was being watched

  of course i was being watched-by the dogs
and possibly by alligators but other eyes were
upon me also and no difference which way i
turned something seemed to be slithering up be-
hind a crazy state of mind i concluded hear-
ing things which did not exist hallucinations
was i becoming jumpy and losing this fine feel-
ing of not being afraid why should i be jerk-
ing my head to right and left i must calm my-
self think of other subjects-la blanca for ex-
ample she had plenty of time to paddle across
before sunset and juan the greasy mop-head
had sobered up sufficiently to wield the stroke
	wonder stories quarterly

oar no use worrying about her but would she
come back well in a few hours i should know

  it may have been these dreamy speculations
or the moonlight or the drowsing fragrance the
jungle breeze brought to my nostrils or the
rhythmic plash of the waves on the beach or the
fact that the jungle symphony had sunk into a
minor key or just plain tiredness-something at
any rate made me feel very sleepy my chin
between my hands elbows on my knees i must
have slept for i had no premonition of danger un-
til a club whirred past my head without know-
ing what had happened i leaped to my feet in
time to sidestep the charge of the loup-garou
and as it stumbled over the chunk upon which

i	had been sitting out went my fist and sprawled
it literally belly-down across the ashes and em-
bers of the fire then foolishly instead of pick-
ing up my revolver and ending matters i gloated
over the frenzied thing until it scrambled afoot
and landed a straight from the shoulder blow in
its grimacing face it would have dazed a mule
but only staggered this thing a man might as
well use his fist on a stone

  howling or laughing i could not tell which
it lunged forward and flopped its long arms
around my waist so down we went together a
sickening embrace with its stinking breath in my
face and the bestial thing was trying to roll
me into the fire my arms were free however
and i managed to break the clinch and get upon
my feet standing upon the defensive i studied
this beast as critically as a bullfighter studies
his bull no doubt about it like sam and the
dogs it was a throwback but in this creature
reversion had done its worst-produced an an-
thropoid figure of a man with deep-set beady
eyes glowing like coals in the hairy face it was
also scrutinizing me somewhat amazedly i
thought for i was still alive and had landed two
blows which may have hurt more than i sup-
posed at any rate instead of charging a sec-
ond time it threw back its head and let out a
sharp blast of hyena laughter-not the insane
cackling to which i had become accustomed but
a barking blast identical with that which sum-
moned the dogs to attack the jaguar

  seeing the pack slink forward my heart stood
still and that sicky sensation which i thought
had gone for good welled up worse than ever
at that moment if the loup-garou had suspected
it he could have pushed me over with his little
finger but there he stood leaning on his
knuckles waiting for the pack to leap to the kill
to my utter mystification however the dogs ad-
vanced only a few paces they seemed to be
torn between conflicting propensities to obey
or disobey the leader-that seemed to be the be-
wildering question in their wild brains turning
in circles they snapped at one another sniffed
shook their hanging heads and finally squatted
on their haunches again that uncanny cackle
louder and angrier than before but the dogs did
not stir

for the leadership

how was i to know that pack law permitted a
rival to depose an old leader any time yet

vaguely a suspicion of the truth popped into my
head the dogs apparently regarded this affair
as a fight for the leadership or mastership in
which neither the pack as a whole nor its mem-
bers could take part the man-smell in me and
the man-smell in this ape-like human must have
made us equally acceptable to their noses and
the old leader sensing the situation more keenly
than i was now himself showing signs of fear
that yellow streak in him even more than the
merciful behavior of the dogs energized me my
gorge was rising no longer weak-kneed i felt
like fighting not to feel afraid-what a feel-
ing instead of forcing matter i stood there
breathing deeply getting stronger bolder mad-
der every moment meanwhile there stood the
ape-man still leaning on his knuckles-naked
grimy open mouthed-glancing furtively side-
ways as if looking for something the club per-
haps it was behind him let him spring for it

i	would spring for my revolver whch was behind
me the revolver in my hand would be more
deadly than the club in his instead of turning to
the club however he leaped at me

  right and left i landed on his bulbous nose
backed up and undercut but because he could
lunge ahead faster than i could back away i
found myself going down in another bestial em-
brace then the fiends bloody nose in my face
brought back that damnable nausea saying to
myself youve got to fight now i tore loose
and fought like hell fought with feet as well
as hands and fell flat upon my back for the
fiend had grabbed hold of my right foot and was
dragging me slowly toward the little inlet which
alligators used as a wallow it was then that my
strength failed

  the hunched back of the beast was all i could
see he was laughing now triumphantly with
my free foot i kicked frantically but my boot
made no impression on that hairy rump i
twisted cursed myself for going limp to the death
this monster was dragging me to thank god
la blanca was not here to   something was
jolting along under my back involuntarily like
a drowning man clutching at a straw my hand
closed round it it was the gorillas club the
club he had thrown at my head a queer club-
a bone a large bone with a hammer-like head
oh the feel of it i would do to this laughing
beast what la blanca did to juan but i must do
it quickly and decisively it was what she did
with her paddle that gave me strength for the
deed that and the feel of the bone rising to
a sitting position i took the bone in both hands
drew back and struck like lightning and the
loup-garou never turned his head he just
stopped laughing dropped my foot and staggered
on into the river-from which no one emerges

  it was all over-but the dogs suspecting that
in their noses a weak-winner stunk i had sense
enough to make a show of strength and it was
not all show for i now felt strong and unafraid
even of the pack it was a new kind of courage
the sterling kind which had always actuated carl
talk about casting out devils i had cast off
fear rising to my feet i brushed the sand from
my clothes stalked straight through the pack
the island

sat down upon my chunk of wood and shouted
com here like a king on a throne i com-
manded and those dumb dogs fawned forward
and dropped upon their bellies by the burnt-out
fire one crawled closer and closer and a half
hour later it was licking the bruises on my hands

  it was four oclock by my watch the moon
stood over the island the loup-garou was no
longer at large the werwolves were dozing at my
feet the denizens of the jungle had gone to their
lairs the day birds would soon be clearing their
throats all was silent golden serene i walked
to the islands edge at some distance from the
place where the laughing lunatic disappeared
took off my clothes and splashed myself with
water god how glorious not to be looking and
listening for danger wonderfully exhilarating
the bath i felt as converts feel while being bap-
tised that blessed bone

  starting the fire over again i spread my clothes
on the warm sand beside it to dry for i had given
them a wash also and picked up the bone then
a creepy suspicion brought the sweat to my brow
and i wondered if my fears were coming back
could this be a human bone firelight and moon-
light confirmed my suspicions beyond the shadow
of a doubt this was a human femur judging by
its length a white mans thighbone and the
white man had been killed recently for the organ-
ic matter was not yet dry

  as certainly as circumstances may decide any-
thing i concluded this bone belonged to my bro-
thers skeleton the realization however did not
disturb me at all on the contrary i gloated over
this avenging bone happily it proved beyond
peradventure that carl did not die in the ana-
condas foul lair he had been killed more merci-
fully more quickly in the open air caught una-
wares as a reckless lad would be by the fiend
that sneaked up on me still more gratifying it
was carl courageous carl that won the fight for
me a bone of his body had brained the beast that
murdered him and saved me from the alligators

  my mission was assuredly ended i was ready
to leave fantasmas island but would la blanca
come across again engaged to juan someone
should save her from that grassy mop-head and
give her an education how quickly she would
learn civilized ways no trouble getting her out
of the jungle but how about getting the jungle
out of her anyway she was white why white
all other mysteries had been solved scientifically
the werwolves were plainly feral hounds the
loup-garou an atavistic lunatic the vampires
jungle bats and the voices had not materialized
but la blanca how could she be a mestiza yet
square-headed and white

  mendelism i shouted the word loud enough
to awaken the dogs it had popped into my head
like a flash an obvious explanation-so obvious
that i had overlooked it entirely did not my
own piebald mare when bred to a sorrel stallion
once give birth to a pure white colt of course
la blancas father the jefes son was the sorrel
stallion her spotted mother the piebald mare
herself the pure white filly had i not seen brin-

tiie

of terror	

die bulls and spotted cows produce prize-winning
white calves and cats didnt carls tortoise-
colored tabby after yowling around with a yel-
low tom fill a basket with kittens one being per-
manently blue-eyed and white didnt i once
pick a peach from an almond tree if mendelism
could produce white colts and calves and kittens
it could produce white people in the same way it
could produce a peach-of-a-girl also if mestizo
fathers and mothers could give birth to indian
papooses they would also now and then give
birth to a spanish child it was the law men-
delian law for when two strains mix ancestors
as well as parents are reproduced what could
be plainer from the comely squaws the blue-
blooded buccaneers seduced the mestizos had
descended then inbreeding doing its best and
worst shuffled and reshuffled the chromosomes
which predetermine traits and characters and
these mestizos these human mosaics were the
result like a player who once in a lifetime draws
all the high cards in two packs which have been
shuffled together la blanca happened to draw a
full set of spanish chromosomes just as juan
and his kind had drawn full sets of indian
chromosomes so she was the one white kitten
in the whole miscegenation a true daughter of
old spain no wonder she could look me level in
the eyes

  it was five oclock the darkest hour before a
tropical dawn but what did i care for darkness
now this splendid feeling of courage why i
hoped something would put it to the test and
something did put it to the test voices some-
where near at hand a woman was calling
certainly anywhere else it would be taken for a
womans voice but here wee-lo-lo wee-
lo-l-o-o the voice was wailing an echo im-
possible  the jungle would smother it a parrot
whoever heard of a wild parrot mimicking a
human voice especially before daybreak it
must be a woman yet there were no women on
this haunted island-unless the loup-garou had a
crazy mate or was this a lost lorelei trying to
wee-lo-lo me into the woods

  listening and speculating i patted my breast
because i was standing the test of course i was
immensely interested but not afraid the wonder
of this unafraid feeling an hour ago such
human outcries would have paralyzed me now

i	hoped the crying creature would materialize
and it did materialize from among the man-
groves at the end of the barricade where la
blanca and i had tied the dugout in which juan
slept a shadow assumed the shape of a woman
a lovely looking lorelei whom any man would
have welcomed the dogs had raised their heads
and the bristles were rising on their backs which
seemed a bit strange for they had lived here long
enough to be on friendly terms with ghosts

  down i shouted at the dogs just as a second
apparition crawled from beneath the mangroves
and rose up beside the first then a hoarse voice
boomed and i shouted back it was a shouting
matter for la blanca and sam had sailed over
to take me off
smoke flared from the flyers and a shell burst in the midst of the attackers scales
and monsters flew in every direction


the struggle

the king of neptune one dutch hoss late
of sing sing prison and now paroled to dana
manson stood upon a rocky plateau on the
planet neptune not an ordinary king was dutch
his clothes hung in shreds the rags draping them-
selves almost gracefully over his stolid figure a
two months beard covered his face and his hair
was raggedly in need of the barbers shears now
he stood on a boulder and
surveyed this small portion
of his vast domain

  to the south and east the
plateau became a valley of
purple hills and gullies
skirted in the distance by the
edge of the yellow-violet jun-
gle the purplish waters of
a great lake to the west of
him heaved and gurgled in-
cessantly among the rocks on
the shore the northern as-
pect of this vast land pre-
sented a picture of great bil-
lows of roaring steam rising
from an outcropping of pure
radium the black canopy of
clouds above admitted al-
most no sunlight the only
source of illumination was
the radium under
the surface of the
ground and this
due to the fluores-
cense of minerals
in the soil was
ghastly violet

hence the kings
face was the hide-
ous color of dough
in a violet light
with a tinge of sick-
ly blue

  surrounding him
were some five
thousand of his na-
tive subjects how
many more there
were he could not
say these nep-
tunians were huge
savages rivaling in
weight even the
largest elephants

their bodies were
gorilla-like except
that they were covered with heavy scales which
rattled and clattered with every movement be-
ing composed of an oily substance intermixed with
grit and thick and heavy enough to offer resist-
ance to a machine gun bullet their mouths wide
and hideous increased the ferocity of faces which
possessed a single eye in the centre of the fore-
head their great arms hung to below their
knees and terminated in three-fingered hands

for neptune

which were so powerful that they could with ease
wrest a human arm from its socket

  yet dutch was unquestioned king of this gro-
tesque horde for he held in his hand a stick tipped
with red crystal-the only spark of red color on
this steaming moist planet perhaps in the re-
mote past an unaccountable fire had broken forth
and the natives had suffered some serious casual-
ties when oily scales caught
fire at any rate the red
crystal was an object of su-
perstitious fear and the
symbol of super-neptunian
power and authority - the
crown jewel as it were only
he who was favored by the
gods could touch that dread-
ful crystal with impunity
only he who dared to touch
it was deemed worthy to pos-
sess the absolute authority
of a monarch

  and now dutch faced his
subjects armed only with
this spark of red he waved
it at the monsters for the
sheer joy of watching them
fall back in terror he was
absolute ruler of a planet

master of thou-
sands of monsters
any one of whom
might easily have
swallowed the scep-
ter and then made
a meal of dutch
but such is the
bondage of super-
stition

  as he watched a
doughnut - shaped
space flyer emerged
from the clouds of
steam and flew rap-
idly toward him
it hovered in the
air and then settled
gently to the
ground dutch wav-
ed his scaly sub-
jects away from
the flyer as the
steel door banged
open and his
friends dana and

dr gailman stepped out

  are you sure that youll be all right alone with
this mob until i get back with the fleet dana
asked apprehensively

  sure all i have to do is wave this jewel at
em and they just about jump out of their scales
ill have em bringing my meals to me in no time
this beats laying around in the pen

  i suppose it does but what would you do



hendrik dahl juve

 in this story sequel to the monsters of nep-
 tune which appealed in the summer quarterly
 our good author treats of some of the lighter
 sides of interplanetary expeditions and explora-
 tions of strange worlds yet despite the humorous
 sides of the situation in which dutch finds him-
 self there is much truth in the picture that mr
 juve gives us if we were to attempt to conquer
 an alien planet the force of numbers alone would
 overwhelm us strategy and a keen understanding
 of psychology of the inhabitants would be the great-
 est weapons that our explorers could use

   however as mr juve suggests a question of
 morals arises here were our explorers justified in
 precipitating these peaceful neptunians into civil
 war and carnage destroying great numbers of them
 in order that we should extract their great deposits
 of radium the question is not easy to answer for
 the neptunians have apparently little use for the
 precious stuff and earthlings have we invite the
 comments of our readers
	wonder stories quarterly

if they should find out that that crystal isnt dan-
gerous after all 

  i never thought of that but you said that it
has probably worked for millions of years so why
shouldnt it work for two or three months longer
anyway they aint wise to it yet so we should
worry

  it probably will continue to be effective but
they arent accustomed to having a soft juicy
king they might take a notion to eat you and
elect a new king you had better keep that cry-
stal with you every minute

  dont worry about me youre only president
of the consolidated interplanetary transport co
but just look at me im king of the whole
planet what i say goes when you get back to
dig radium ill have these huskies all ready to
run picks and shovels

  thats great-but how are you going to tell
them

  well-i aint thought of that i-

  just a moment dr gailman interrupted i
can take care of that

  going into the ship he presently began to
squeal and bellow and they knew that he was
making dictaphone records of the language

alone

dr gailman sole survivor of the last of
many ill-fated exploring expeditions had been
saved by the natives for some special feast but
had been rescued by dana and dutch during
his long wait he had learned most of the simple
language of the neptunians

  presently he returned with a reproducer and
several records which he handed to dutch

  here are records of most of their language
it shouldnt take you long to learn it since it is
very simple

  fine thanks said dutch now ill be able
to tell em what to do

  and you look like a scarecrow said dana
dont you want some new clothes there are
plenty in the ship

  thats a good idea this suit is kinda drop-
ping off

  dutch handed his scepter to dana and went
into the locker room of the ship he turned on
the electric lights and found a red silk pajama
affair-the prevailing fashion of the day after
a bath and shave he donned the new clothing and
felt more like a monarch when he emerged
he found that dana had spread the camp equip-
ment and canned food over the damp ground in
orderly fashion

  thought that you might feel less like an ani-
mal if you had a camping outfit he said

  fine weve been living in the jungle so long
that i didnt think of that

  say he exclaimed looking down at his suit
whats the matter with this outfit it was red
when i put it on i thought a red suit would be
good to help keep these huskies away from me
dana laughed there is no red light here to
be reflected from the suit thats why its nearly
black out here

  but this jewel is red

  certainly but that red is due to fluores-

ence if you know what i mean

  well just so it stays red we should worry
if thats all said dana wed better be get-
ting under way whatever you do dutch be
careful and be sure that you retain control so
that when we come back you can protect us the
best way to do that is to keep out of trouble see
that none of the neptunians happen to touch the
crystal if they should find out that the crystal
is harmless our chance of getting anywhere with
our radium mine is gone and the only way wed
ever get you back to the earth would be to take
three or four of our big friends along

  so long dont worry about me and what-
ever you do dont forget to bring some smokes
his two companions entered the ship and closed
the door dutch stood with some private mis-
givings to be sure watching the ship leap into the
air and disappear into the canopy of clouds

  for a full minute dutch stared at the vanished
flyer and his last opportunity to return to the
earth for a long time it seemed to take him that
long to realize that he was alone among savages
but stoic that he was he presently shrugged his
wide shoulders and then set about the work of
pitching camp he decided to establish his pal-
ace beside the shallow river south of the plateau
although he dared not drink the violet water he
felt that there would be some comfort and feeling
of home if he could hear the gurgle of the river
then too the air was not so heavy out here in the
open as in the jungle but there was little choice
for the air was damp and hot permeated with
the smell of growing and decaying vegetation
as dana had said it smells like an old rotten
cellar with a new cedar door

  the king motioned several of his subjects to
pick up his equipment at first they did not un-
derstand but after some difficulty and demonstra-
tions he managed to convey the idea five of
them gathered up the stores and followed him
across the plateau the others drawing up in a
vast procession of clattering scales it was a
triumphal march

  he forded the river and then selected a site
for his camp having motioned his porters to
deposit their burdens he then waved them on into
the jungle they obediently rattled away and
disappeared into the growth of trees and vines

  the monarch set up his tent and arranged his
little stock of provisions there was a gasoline
camp stove a cot and bedding cooking utensils
and a folding chair when all was in order the
king sat down on the edge of the cot with a sigh
of contentment automatically reaching into his
pocket for his cigarette makins he remembered
with disappointment that he was completely
out

  well ill- he began and then shrugged
better learn some language

  he set up the phonograph and shoved a record
into place dr gailman had substituted a horn
for the usual tubes and the king now sat back
listening to the squeals and bellows by which he
was to make himself understood throughout his

   note the particles shot from the radium la the ground atrike
the cryatal and cause it to glow with induced light in thi cane a
red glow in the ordinary aunlight of the earth the crystal might
have been clear u plate glass or any other coior
the struggle for neptune	

kingdom slowly a grin spread over his pasty
face

  oh my-gosh what a lingo but i might as
well start learning it now as laughing at it

  setting the needle at the beginning of the record
and having played the first bellow he imitated it
carefully and tried to associate it with its mean-
ing in english then he stopped the machine and
repeated the word over and over until he was cer-
tain that he knew it thoroughly treating each
subsequent word in the same thus began the
education of the king

chapter ii

trouble

for several days all went well with the king
he detailed several of the monsters to act a
personal servants and others he selected for
his body guard although he had studied the lan-
guage diligently he now found necessity forced
him to learn more rapidly and easily since food
was of prime interest he learned the names of
fruits and vegetables as quickly as possible the
king found delight in sitting before his tent and
bellowing orders which sent scaly monsters into
the jungle in search of delicacies they heaped
half ton piles of delicious and strange fruits
about his tent never daring however to ap-
proach nearer than fifty feet to the dreaded cry-
stal

  the monarch sampled different fruits selecting
those which pleased him most and ordering the
rest taken away since he dared not drink the
water of the river he ordered more grooons a trans-
arent fruit about the size of a football and which
ung like a huge drop of water the king punc-
tured the skin with the can opener and emptied
the juice into a pitcher the taste reminded him
of a combination of strawberries and apricots
it had just the right amount of tang and he was
further pleased to find that the drink warmed
him ever so slightly

  there were other fruits which he decided to or-
der frequently great pods some five and others
twelve feet long furnished him with vegetables
which he found were just right for boiled din-
ners he took another drink of grooon juice and
reached for his makins

  rats if i had a smoke now life would be
perfect but i better learn some more language

  he leaned back in his chair listening to the
groans and bellows from the phonograph mim-
icking them as best as he could his servants
stood about listening and watching him curiously

  thus continued the life of the monarch for sev-
eral sleeps as he put it for there were no days
and nights with which to reckon time one day
however he noticed that one of his servants and
one of his guards were acting queerly

  the king had orderd a fresh supply of grooons
and glaaams a variety of vegetable pod but one
of the servants refused to move in response to the
order of his king this savage gaambee by
name had from the first seemed reluctant to
salaam before this foreign usurper of the throne
but this was the first sign of open rebellion

dutch became angry seizing his red tipped

scepter he rushed savagely at the rebellious
monster shouting as best he could in their lan-
guage

  move he ordered to the jungle and
bring me food go

  as he advanced waving the red crystal the
monsters eye opened wide with terror but he
stood his ground firmly encouraged the king
leaped at the savage expecting to see the nep-
tunian cower and then slink away into the jungle
to fulfil orders but the great elephantine
monster lay down upon the ground and refused
to move he gazed terror-stricken at the red
crystal but seemed to be ready for whatever fate
befel those who were touched by the fateful red
light he had the courage to die for his convict-
ing

  the king stopped abruptly he was non-
plussed he realized that if he should touch
the scaly giant with the red spark the neptunian
would find that he was but the victim of a super-
stitious fear and dutch would shortly be repos-
ing in the monsters spacious stomach

  dutch went back to think it over here was
something he had not anticipated evidently one
of his subjects had become philosophical and
was ready to sacrifice his life in passive resist-
ance to his rule he must show his authority-
but how to rush upon the monster meant cer-
tain death to tolerate such gross insubordina-
tion meant the loss of his kingdom and still
worse the loss of danas life

  the king was in a dilemma he had no weap-
on with which to slay the rebel nor had he the
means for tying him up although dutch was
in no immediate personal danger the rebellion
might spread when the others saw the success
with which gaambee resisted sovereign orders
although the king did not know the technical
details here was the beginning of the passive
resistance of subjects that rides in advance of
national upheavals all that he realized was
that he must not touch the balky savage with the
crystal but that he must do something and do it
quickly

   to his right stood the six members of his body-
guard on duty at this time an idea filtered
through his stolid mind

  guards he bellowed the king is insulted
here i am trying to civilize you and make some-
thing out of you and this man aint got enough
sense to see it eat him up or throw him into
the lake or make him obey orders it aint the
kings job to touch a rebel

  the guards started forward to obey but one of
their number an exceptionally huge young sav-
age named meebroo leaped in front of them
and held up his arms to stop them the other
five stopped short but kept an eye upon the
crystal in the hands of their sovereign

dutch listened to meebroo talk to them he
told them that they should fight for their rights
and positively refuse to obey the orders of this
foreign usurper he harangued them for their
lack of pride were they going to kill one of
their own flesh and blood just because a soft
little animal such as they had eaten on other oc-
casions ordered them to were they so degen-
	wonder stories quarterly

erate that they were going to subject themselves
to foreign slavery for the rest of their lives he
became blasphemous perhaps the red light
was not sacred when in the hands of the for-
eigner 

  this last remark spread horror among the
cowed five never before had so audacious a
remark been made and they watched meebroo
evidently expecting to see him struck down by
some supernatural agency but nothing hap-
pened

  see he continued nothing harms me
are you going to obey orders

  the others stood irresolute and dutch decided
that it was time to interpose

  i hold tbe jewel he bellowed i am the
king dont listen to those infidels or something
will happen to you dont you know a nation
divided against itself aint nothing but a mob

   the five irresolute guards were terror-stricken
and started to advance but the one held them
he told them that they had nothing to fear
while he himself probably expected destruction
momentarily when nothing happened he be-
came bolder and more arrogant he told them
that they were fools to listen to this foreigner
he told them to run into the jungle if they were
afraid to be near the king but not to obey his
orders and he won the five stood

  dutch was desperate he wanted to run and
hide in the jungle but thoughts of dana stopped
him he realized that should dana and his
men land upon the planet with the natives in
control they would be promptly eaten he sat
down upon his wobbly throne to ponder the
situation

combat

the more the king pondered the situation the
more he was convinced that more lives than
one were at stake there were his own shape
and dignity to safeguard but still more import-
ant the life of his only friend dana to preserve
he had no weapons but even if he had they
would have been ineffectual anyway he real-
ized that he was helpless to enforce his orders
for these two insurgents either of whom could
eat him without feeling overfed were beginning
to pierce the thin shell of his authority he
stuck the scepter upright in the ground and
leaned back to think but it was useless

  meebroo was drawing closer experimental-
ly evidently an overpowering desire to run
and hide in the jungle asserted itself and the
king forgot everything but that hideous mouth
and hungry eye he arose from his camp stool
picked up his scepter and a few articles which
he might need in the simple life of exile now
that he could not see the cruel mouth of his en-
emy he again thought of dana the only man
who had befriended him and treated him as an
human being and equal no he must not run

  the king replaced the articles and again
started for the chair before the tent flaps in
his worry and fright he stumbled over the five
gallon gasoline can and sprawled headlong on
the ground he sat up and rubbed his bruised
shin and regarded the offending can fire
they had used it before

  the monarch went into action he seized a
tin cup from the folding table and filled it from
the can he looked out at the insurgent who
was still lying on the ground eyeing him curious-
ly and just a little triumphantly dutch found a
match and holding the scepter and cup of gaso-
line in the same hand advanced upon the prone
rebel

  do you still refuse to obey orders he
roared

  there was no answer

  go to the jungle and bring me food dutch
ordered still the rebel refused to answer or
move the others stood about watching fright-
ened and curious they evidently detected a
new note in the kings voice

  ill give you one more chance the king bel-
lowed if you dont beat it ill call the great
red light down on you and then wherell you
be

  the rebel cringed in terror but stubbornly
refused to move his passive resistance had
been successful thus far and he evidently con-
sidered his victory a permanent one

  dutch struck the match and dropped it into
the cup of gasoline it puffed slightly and then
began to burn vigorously

  go he ordered again

  when the monster refused to obey this final
command the king threw the blazing liquid over
the prone savage spreading out over the
scales the gasoline instantly leaped into a fierce
blaze and a cloud of black smoke the rebel
leaped to his feet with a deafening bellow of
terror but the damage was done the oily
scales burst into murky flame

  dutch turned and fled to a safe distance and
then stopped to watch the living torch rushed
this way and that trying to escape the scorching
flames but it was useless a wide circle had
cleared as the other monsters drew back in ter-
ror eagerly the flames licked at the scales
hissing and sputtering the monster was a mass
of fire a great cloud of black smoke followed
him as he ran about the cleared space

  he weakened staggered righting himself
he took another step and then pitched heavily
upon the kings tent flattening it to the ground
with a crash of tent poles and furniture the
king groaned

  the gasoline can crushed under the impact
now added its contents to the conflagration and
the fire leaped into a roaring pyre of destruc-
tion

  dutch looked toward the wet dripping jungle
-his future home the future looked soggy
indeed he was now without matches and gas-
oline to enforce his orders nothing remained
but the red-tipped scepter

chapter iii

more trouble

the last glowing embers of the tragedy were
sending up a thin smudge of burning flesh
when the king turned toward the yellow-violet
tangle of wet trees and vines the savages ter-
rified by the frightful display of sovereign dis-
the struggle for neptune	

pleasure groveled in their attempts to please
their mighty king but kept at a very respectful
distance meebroo the guard alone seemed to
be unconvinced he remained unbending and
contemptuous dutch watched him closely but
that was all that he could do about it

  the king was sorrowful not that he be-
moaned the loss of the rebel-there were plenty
of inhabitants-but he bewailed the loss of the
comparative comforts and dignity of his camp
he had gone half way to the jungle when an
idea occurred to him slowly the plans formu-
lated and he again issued orders he would
build a brush hut

  he turned back to the river and selected a new
site while some of his subjects were in the
jungle gathering brush and vines he ordered
others to clear the ground with their powerful
fingers other dug two holes some twelve feet
apart and two feet deep the monarch then
went to the jungle and selected two sniall trees
which he ordered to be broken down and
snapped off to the proper length these were
set into the holes a ridge pole was then slid
between them thru the forks and the whole
covered with a thick layer of brush he then or-
dered a large rock taken to the door of his hut
to be arranged as a seat he was again the
mighty monarch who possessed the only house
and throne on the planet

  in all dignity dutch sat down and ordered
fruits brought from the jungle again the or-
derly routine of existence began

  for three sleeps dutch although without
material luxuries lived in all the despotic life
of an oriental potentate his subjects groveled
in their attempts to please him

  only the young giant meebroo positively re-
fused to obey orders although he did not dare
attempt to do the king personal injury his phil-
osophy did not permit him to bow down to or-
ders he maintained his regime of passive re-
sistance despite the horrible fate of his co-con-
spirator at first the king chose to ignore him
entirely so far as open attempts to break down
his resistance were concerned nevertheless he
realized that here was a nucleus about which a
fatal canker might grow

  it was upon arising from his fourth sleep
that the king stretched yawned and then or-
dered fruit his servants were on their way
and the king was about to seat himself upon his
throne when he stiffened meebroo had acquired
a convert

  this new addition to the camp of the rebels
was a huge hot tempered member of the kings
own servant mob his name was grroo he
was younger than meebroo but even larger

  dutch was furious he arose from his throne
too angry to be dignified he rushed at the new
rebel waving his scepter as he bellowed orders
that the young servant go immediately to the
jungle

  grroo was terrified he cowered before the
wrath of the monarch and was on the point of
terror-stricken flight when meebroo fortified him
with words of moral courage dutch tried to
overwhelm the new convert with sheer force of

bluster but the elder rebel laid hold upon his new
ally and reassured him dutch was now almost
upon them and dared not go farther this did
much to calm grroo for he seemed to lose some
of his fright and a light of dogged determina-
tion came into his eye he assumed an attitude
of resigned persistence

   realizing that he had lost his one opportunity
dutch returned to his throne where he sat pon-
dering this new situation as doggedly as they
faced him his breakfast arrived and he ate
heartily of raw fruits for he had no fire

  after the meal the king began anew to con-
sider his dilemma now this particular king was
not accustomed to resort to strategy when con-
fronted with trouble before coming to nep-
tune and into his kingship it had been his policy
to go into instant and violent action and then to
do his arguing with his foot on his enemys chest
but here he was confronted by beings so ponder-
ous that such tactics were obviously foolhardy
hence this unusual strain upon his mental pro-
cesses

  often while reading newspapers at his far-a-
way home on the earth dutch had wondered
about this thing called diplomacy he had looked
upon it as the admission of weakness and the
cloak of graft but now he began to see it in a
new light and to wish that he had had occasion
to develop this unique and strenuous method of
settling disputes

  for on hour he cast about for some inspira-
tion never before had he spent so much time
over one little problem he wondered why mee-
broo chose to regard him with distaste what
could he gain as if this question were a key
that unlocked the vast storehouse of his subcon-
scious dutch suddenly realized that meebroo
had his eye upon this job of being king he real-
ized that the rebel was not motivated by any de-
sire to better his race or to relieve them of bond-
age-there was no such high thought anywhere
on the planet-but to shift the advantage of this
bondage to himself this ambition was prob-
ably enhanced by the prospect of a kingly meal
should he succeed in overthrowing the ruler

strategy

the king wondered what was to be done next
now that there were two of the enemy to con-
tend with what did the so-called diplomats do
when they were in a snarl like this shift the
responsibility and pretend to divide the spoils
but the king was a man of action scarcely had
the thought flashed through his mind when he
leaped to his feet and addressed the two rebels

  the king knows that meebroo and grroo are
brave and wise it aint right that they should
work-they should boss the rest i have de-
cided to make them chiefs well divide the tribe
into two smaller tribes and meebroo can boss
one half and grroo the other of course ill be
king of the whole bunch and youll be my lieu-
tenants

  dutch paused to see the result of his words
the two rebels had become suddenly interested
the idea seemed novel to them but it appealed to
	wonder stories quarterly

their limited intelligence they nodded vigor-
ously with a great clatter of scales

  the king sent his servants into the jungle to
call the tribe together and then sat down to wait
and listen to his two lieutenants discuss the mat-
ter

  although dutch could not yet understand all
their words he gathered from their talk that a
rivalry existed between them it happened that
they were both of the younger set and unmarried
now that they had suddenly become men of
power and distinction they wished to marry but
contention arose when they discovered that they
each wished to marry the same female the com-
munity belle

  dutch listened and grinned

  sounds just like the time jimmy nichols and
me had a scrap over the jenson girl and she
settled it by walking home from school with an-
other guy wonder where she is now the
king said this aloud since he often talked to
himself to relieve his loneliness

  the discussion of the lieutenants was inter-
rupted by the approach of the first members of
the tribe from the jungle the word had spread
rapidly and now thousands of the scaly monsters
poured from the tangle of vines from all sides
until the din of their powerful voices and clat-
tering scales was terrific

  dutch directed them to assemble on the pla-
teau and then picking up his scepter he fol-
lowed the seemingly endless stream they
formed a dense crowd on the level ground the
king estimated that there were at least ten thous-
and present still others were coming across
the hills and fording the river he waited

  never until now had the king realized the vast-
ness of his kingdom he wondered how many of
the beasts there might be on other continents but
had no means of knowing some fifty thousand
were now gathered waiting patiently for his
words fifty feet away stood his two lieuten-
ants and his body guard dutch unable to make
his voice carry to the vast multitude addressed
himself to his lieutenants

  go through the bunch and divide them in
two he ordered those on the left side will be
under the orders of meebroo and the rest under
grroo then tell em what its all about

  dutch having given his orders swelled out his
chest just a trifle for it thrilled even this stolid
king to command so vast a herd then too he
was delighted by the turn of events

  the two went through the assemblage of mon-
sters clearing a lane there was a great commo-
tion and clatter of scales intermingled with a
bellowing that reminded dutch of a stampede of
texas long horns at last the herd was divided
and the commanders ordered silence gradually
the hubbub subsided and the lieutenants ex-
plained the situation to the two groups dutch
grinned delightedly when each leader enlarged
upon his greatness in the eyes of the king

  maybe thatll hold em awhile whoda
thought that theyd take me up on it

chapter iv

thunder

the leaders were waxing large and boastful and
all was progressing nicely when a new ele-
ment of discord entered into this division of
spoils since females and calves as dutch
called the young were in the groups as well as
males the female under dispute between the
two leaders was present and since she could
not be in both groups at the same time trouble
was pending

  the friction rose when grroo discovered her
in meebroos crowd instantly he forgot his own
greatness and clattered over to her without
ceremony he seized her giant hand and hustled
her toward his own tribe but this did not meet
with the approval of meebroo and he intercepted
them the ensuing argument lasted for fifteen
minutes becoming more personal and intense as
time elapsed dutch became alarmed

  lets settle this argument like gentlemen he
bellowed suppose we let the lady decide and
see who wins

  they did not understand until he explained
that she might choose one of them the idea was
entirely new but finally they agreed to try it

  choose dutch ordered

  the female in the case hesitated looking first
at one and then at the other suddenly she
pointed her finger at dutch himself

  the ignominy of the proposal staggered the
king at last he found his voice

  no no i dont want you choose one of
the lieutenants

  again she hesitated casting amorous glances
upon dutch but he waved his scepter at her and
she fell back in terror

  now choose he ordered

  too terrified to disobey she instantly pointed
to grroo the triumphant suitor again seized
her hand and proceeded to conduct her to his
tribe

  now the idea of the woman choosing the hus-
band seemed to be the only solution so far as
grroo was concerned and he wished to drop the
argument at once but meebroo seemed to think
that there was something wrong and expressed
himself emphatically again the argument be-
came hot the two bellowed and squealed while
the woman under dispute stood aside frightened
and astonished

  the king became alarmed once more he
shouted orders that they desist but they could
not hear his puny voioe through the uproar fin-
ally he drew back

  what if they do fight-one might kill the
other and thatll leave only one to bother with
he shrugged

  he drew farther away from the quarrel for
it had now approached the point where the
science of hurtled solids might be employed he
listened to their argument

  suddenly there was a pause in the vocal bar-
rage meebroo had thought of a wonderful idea

  arent we each leaders of half of the tribe
he challenged suppose we lead our tribes into
the struggle for neptune	

battle and let the winner have the girl no one
except the one in the right can possibly be the
winner

  grroo pondered this challenge he possessed
the female through her own choice and that was
the only possible brand of justice that he could
countenance the idea of might being inter-
changeable with right had suddenly became too
crude for this particular philosopher

  i dont think that might makes right he
said in effect but if you desire trouble of
course ill defend my property to the best of
my ability

  meebroo turned to his tribe and fired them to
battle with a speech that would have done jus-
tice to the best agitator he pictured to them
the luxury of enslaving the other tribe he told
them of the great feast they would have after
the battle when enemy dead were strewn over
the field never before had the spoils of war
been so attractively pictured to potential can-
non fodder he told them of the insults that
had been heaped upon them by their enemy he
told them that their very existence was at stake

  under his fiery words the mob grew restless
their eyes gleamed with hate for their mortal
enemies they began to sway in unison to the
rhythm of the emotional words of their leader
emitting howls of rage and calls for blood the
scales rattled more and more loudly until the
voice of the speaker was lost in the vast crash-
ing thunder even the roar of the steam from
the radium was drowned out

  at the psychological moment meebroo sprang
toward the enemy and then deftly got out of the
way it was the last straw the vast assemblage
of monsters surged into action

  dutch was terrified never before had a king
run so fast he bounded over the plateau like
a frightened deer until he felt safe in the dis-
tance

  stopping to view the battle he saw that two
armies men women and children were surging
and milling in a hopeless combat while the two
commanders stood aside and shouted encourage-
ment the din was frightful there was the
clatter of millions of scales clashing and rattling
and the deafening uproar of fifty thousand tre-
mendous voices heightened by cries of rage and
hate and pain

  boulders clouded the air and occasionally the
giant contenders themselves were flung bodily
over the heads of the others the ground itself
shook with the impact of heavy feet and bodies

  dutch despite his stoicism was appalled his
little diplomatic ruse had grown to the propor-
tions of an earthquake he tried to think of
some means of stopping the carnage but the ter-
rific din confused him and he gave it up

  the warriors became heated steam rose from
the struggle and a strong odor of fish permeated
the air gradually the mob strung out into a
line as one side tried to surround the other and
they in turn reached out to forestall the move
the fighting line grew longer and longer until
the fighters were spread over five or six miles of
plain

  the center of the line began to bend the

warriors of meebroo were gradually forcing the
enemy back the fighting becoming more in-
tense the army of meebroo began to shout with
redoubled force as it perceived that it was tri-
umphant boulders flew thicker and faster
grroos whole line wavered and then broke and
fled in wild confusion the ground was strewn
with dead and wounded

  gradually the shouting died down and the up-
roar ceased meebroo came up to his king tri-
umphant and glutted with victory

  meebroo is right he gloated grroo was
wrong woman should not choose their mates-
it is proved

  clear the dead off the field dutch ordered
he had the upper hand of the situation and
meant to keep it

  meebroo clattered away and bellowed orders
quickly the dead and wounded were gathered
up and the vast procession filed away into the
jungle

  from previous experience dutch knew where
they were going deep in the jungle was a huge
grotto where gruesome ceremonies were held

tbe victor celebrate

although the king cared nothing for their
ceremonies he was uneasy seldom it was
that dutch anticipated trouble but the odds
against him were so stupendous that he dared
not but follow his subjects since there was
nothing left of his palace equipment he turned
toward the jungle and followed the victorious
army he crossed the stream and then wound
around the hills until he came to the great tangle
of yellow-violet trees and vines so dense was
the growth that the natives maintained tunnels
through the dripping mass the king selected
one of the tunnels into which the army had dis-
appeared and plunged after in pursuit

   had this jungle been on the earth the interior
of the tunnel would have been dark as night
but here the light came up from the ground
thus maintaining a uniform intensity of illumina-
tion that was equal to that of the plain

  the path had been churned by countless feet
into a thin creamy mud in which the king waded
ankle deep but it was this same disagreeable
mud which guided him through the maze of
tunnels and cross passages for the sides of the
recently used course were newly splashed with
dripping mud occasionally he heard the bel-
low of warriors deep in the jungle but so far in
advance were they that it was only the louder
sounds that reached him

  for three sleeps the king penetrated deeper
and deeper into the mysterious jungle living on
the fruits which grew in abundance and bewail-
ing the fact that his personal servants were not
present to administer to his wants at last he
heard the tremendous thump thump of the great
drums and knew that he had not far to go

  the booming of the drums became louder as
he advanced and after two or three miles he
could hear faintly the rattle of the scales as they
clattered in unison with the drumbeats two
more miles and he came to the turn in the tunnel
that revealed the grotto
	wonder stories quarterly

  a monster room had been torn out of the
living jungle by the natives it was equal in
size to four city blocks and about two hundred
feet high in the center yet so dense was the
matted vines of the roof that no opening re-
vealed the black canopy of clouds above

  the dead had been piled up in the center of
the amphitheater and a part of the tribe of mee-
broo was dancing to the rhythm of eight monster
hollow-log drums as eight musicians beat upon
them with huge boulders the logs emitted a
strangely resonant boom that shook the walls of
the grotto and this together with the clatter of
scales and the thump of hundreds of feet made
the din deafening

  the king went into the room and stood against
the wall for a time steam rose from the bodies
of the dancers and the place smelled like a fish
stall in july

    suddenly the tempo of the drummers
changed and the dancers filed out of the grotto
while another group of the victors took their
places dutch knew that the others were now
resting and that this ridiculous dancing would
continue for at least five days

  now the king noticed an alarming develop-
ment mingled with the dancers were some na-
tives whom he recognized as belonging to grroos
crowd far from being ejected by the victors
they were accepted as if trouble had never ex-
isted between them in fact their recent diffi-
culty seemed to have been forgotten entirely

  eventually the king tired of watching the
stupendous dance and went back into the tun-
nel he walked for a half hour and then bur-
rowed into the dense jungle beside the tunnel
after kicking and shoving he cleared a space
and lay down to sleep for this stolid king there
was nothing like a good nap to dispel trouble-
some thoughts

  it required five regular sleeps and as many
naps before the proceedings came to a climax
dutch returned to the grotto when he heard un-
mistakable signs in the increased speed of the
dancers the entire tribe and most of grroos
followers were now in the chamber dancing
desperately the place was hot and moist and
the fishy odor was almost choking added to
this was a new odor coming from the center of
the hall

  whereas the sound had been terrible at the
start now that they were all present it was thun-
derous the very ground shook in unison with
the drums

  gradually the drummers increased the speed
of the dance until the natives were contorting
frantically dutch knew that the time and the
meat were almost ripe

  now a cold perspiration oozed out of the king
part way around the side of the grotto and out of
the mad swirl he spied meebroo and grroo con-
versing on the friendliest of terms

  dutch slipped into one of the tunnels and hur-
riedly found cross tunnels until he was on their
side of the grotto quickly he ran to the edge
of the hall where he could be near his rebellious
lieutenants they were standing beside the tun-
nel mouth bellowing loudly at each other that

their voices might be heard above the din dutch
listened

  we were fools meebroo was saying we
fought over a girl only to have her killed in the
battle at least now we can be friends and
combine against the despot he was right when
he said that a nation divided against itself aint
nothing but a mob

  and did you see when he called the red light
down on poor gaambee he had something in
his hand other than that scepter i have been
wondering about it ever since it happened i
believe that it was some other magic than the red
wand i have been wondering if the rest of his
magic was not destroyed when gaambee fell over
his tunnel and crushed it i have noticed that he
has not used the magic again although he should
have

  i have been wondering about that too as
soon as the feast is over i myself will test him
i am no longer afraid of the red light it seems
to me that it amounts to nothing we can then
get control of the nation and live as we should
live

  the other philosopher agreed but we must
not let the common herd know of our discovery
to blaspheme as we are apparently now doing
might result in our being eaten

chapter v

the king flees

the king drew back into the tunnel his jn-
sight into human and animal nature told him
that his reign was rapidly drawing to an end

  he was on the verge of flight when suddenly he
was arrested by an abrupt silence that permeated
the place not a scale rattled not a breath
stirred the jungle became a place of profound
silence but only for a moment as abruptly as
the dancing had ceased pandemonium shook the
air and jarred the ground the king ran to the
mouth of the tunnel and watched the feast for-
getful of his own danger the entire mob grroo
and meebroo included had pounced upon the af-
termath of battle and the loosened scales flew in
all directions presently violet bones followed the
scales

  for a half hour the king enjoyed his disgust
and then it was too late the wild feast was over
and meebroo still gnawing on a bone spied the
king standing beside the tunnel with a bellow
that rang high above the turmoil he threw away
the bone and charged at the monarch grroo close
at his heels

  forgetting his late adventures in diplomacy the
king turned and fled ignominiously down the tun-
nel he sped around a turn and then gathered his
wits out of the chaos of panic he realized that
he could not hope to outrun the monsters there
was but one thing to do and he did it hastily
finding a spot where the jungle was less dense
than usual the king burrowed out of the path in
a most unkingly fashion and just in time
scarcely had he concealed himself than the two
rebels clattered by

  dutch knew that he was comparatively safe for
the time being for he recalled that these monsters
the struggle for neptune	

seldom left the tunnels except in search of food
but that did not alleviate the danger into wnich
dana might fly at any moment the more he
thought of dana the more desperate he became
he felt that he was not fulfilling a trust-the only
trust that had ever amounted to anything and
now that the two rebels had combined against him
there was no room for diplomatic experiments

  perhaps for the first time in his life dutch was
sorely worried he thrust aside a mad impulse
to go out and battle in the good old way against
frightful odds he looked at the bright little
crystal in the end of the scepter and then thrust
it from him with a snort he lay pondering for a
time and then regretting his rash move he again
clutched the harmless weapon for he realized
that it was still effective against all except the two
rebels who had abandoned their passive resistance
for the more effective regime

  quietly he listened to the other members of the
tribe disperse through the many tunnels when
the clatter of their scales was lost in the depths of
the jungle and all was quiet the exile pushed his
way into the tunnel and turned toward the north
one thought was uppermost in his mind before
the rebels found opportunity to take over the
reigns of government and eat the king he would
warn his friend away from the perils which lurked
on every hand even though they might not dig
radium and revolutionize transportation on the
earth at least danas life might be saved and pos-
sibly his own

  damn he groaned sitting around in sing
sing beats this im beginning to miss the iron
scenery

  as rapidly as possible and with a minimum of
sleeps the ex-king traveled toward the plain
where he knew that dana would land his fleet of
ships occasionally he was forced to burrow out
of the tunnel to avoid natives who were searching
for him foi-tunately for dutch the monsters
could not move without a loud clatter of scales
while he himself could slip noiselessly along

  at last he came in sight of the clearing but now
his heart fell along the edge of the jungle na-
tives had been stationed as far as he could see
was that circle of sentinels he drew back into
a clump of brush that stood isolated at the edge
of the plain and relapsed into a policy of watchful
waiting

  presently he spied meebroo and grroo coming
toward him when they came within a quarter
of a mile of his hiding place he could follow some
of their conversation

  he is sure to come here again and then the
guards can locate him and we will have a chance
to try out that scepter meebroo was saying
then too the other infidels might come back to
get him and we can have a great feast

  he missed part of grroos reply but picked up

some of it ----reasonable that they would not

leave him here surely you reason correctly

  there followed some low tones that were prob-
ably too blasphemous for the ears of the mob

  but the ex-king was tired and sleepy and soon
had passed into oblivion even a sorely beset
exile cannot remain awake forever

  for two sleeps dutch remained on watch

occasionally he crept from his hiding place and
went into the jungle to gather fruit but always
returned to his hiding place for from here he com-
manded a view of much of the plain

  as time passed he became more restless and
worried try as he did he could figure out no
plan to regain control of the natives he had
found from experience that for the best results
shrewd diplomacy required two factions but now
the entire tribe was solidly united under the lead-
ership of the reconciled rebels and his friend
dana was due to return at any moment

  another sleep passed and still he found no
solution he had thought of catching one of the
rebels alone and trying to split up the merger but
the two had become as chummy as damon and
pythias added to this inconvenience was the
danger of being eaten before he could have time
to say anything dutch idly wondered if they
found solace in each others company now that the
common object of their hymeneal ambitions was
dead

  but time was slipping and each moment brought
catastrophe closer dutch had racked his mind
for hours but only one solution presented itself
he decided that he would watch until he saw one
of danas space flyers drop through the black
cloud at first sight of the ship he would run out
from his cover and give himself up trusting that
this would so divert the attention of the natives
that they would not notice the ships he figured
on the further chance that dana might happen to
see dutch run out and be eaten and then deduce
what had happened not a bright prospect truly
but the only one dutch could evolve and the only
chance he saw for preserving his friends life

death and life

with his mind fully made up and his plans
ready dutch lay back in his hiding place
watching the black canopy of vapor for hours he
lay not daring to leave in search of food

  at last he was rewarded a black object
dropped cautiously through the cloud ceiling and
hovered for a moment as though scanning the
ground beneath dutch leaped to his feet in read-
iness to rush out into the open he took another
glance at the ship to make sure that her telescopes
had cleared the vapor since he wished to assure
himself that they would see his bloody signal

  for an instant he hovered between sacrifice and
amazement there was something familiar yet
strange about the ship he waited a red light
suffused the ship and the cloud the flyer dropped
lower and dutch drew back into the brush too
amazed to think even with usual slowness instead
of the doughnut shaped craft from the earth this
was spherical on top was a tower which emitted
a powerful red light then he knew he had seen
them often it was a space flyer from mars the
red light was characteristic of them when in flight

  the ship dropped lower and the light from the
nullifier dropped below the cloud the whole plain
was suffused by the ghastly red light

  the craft sank slowly to the ground and then
when the nullifier was shut off the blaze of red
light went out doors clanged open and several
of the queer little egg-shaped men from mars came
	wonder stories quarterly

out of their flyer to survey the countryside dutch
had often seen these men on freighters plying be-
tween the earth and mars and had never ceased
to marvel their egg-shaped bodies were fitted
with long slender arms and legs but the most
amazing thing about them was the single com-
pound eye perched on the end of a spike protruding
from the top of the neckless head since the eye
was spherical they could see in all directions at the
same time no wonder their ships were odd

 but the ex-king was thinking here again
were the two factions for his simple diplomatic
manipulations so rapidly did thoughts and plans
flash through dutchs mind that he was startled
and confused but one thought was uppermost
greater diplomacy hath no man than he who sac-
rifices the lives of his enemies for his friends and
himself

  the neptunians had all drawn into the jungle
and not a single being stirred dutch had seen
meebroo and grroo scurry into a tunnel some dis-
tance from his own and he now dived into a cross
tunnel and sped rapidly to the east at last he
came to the tunnel into which the two rebels had
gone he found the two talking in low tones twen-
ty or more of his subjects huddled nearby

  dutch rushed up to the rebels who were now so
occupied with this new intrusion that they did not
think of philosophizing over the remains of the
now more familiar earthian he brandished his
scepter and began his speech

  now you guys are in for ithe said in eng-
lish and then recovered himself and switched to
their tongue now you guys are in a sweet mess
those are the terrible men from mars they have
come to enslave you and your people if they get
control over this planet they will work you and
your kids for ages they are greedy and danger-
ous they think only of their own good they
must be destroyed

  but meebroo objected didnt you see the
great magic the sacred gleam that lighted up the
whole place it is the most powerful magic we
have seen we shall be destroyed

  dutch waved the argument aside with a snort
that aint magic at all it cant kill like this wand
im holding you have seen me call down the red
magic their light aint magic because they are
infidels it is only a light meebroo and grroo
you are the mightiest of the land except me i
make you leaders who are to go out there and kill
the men of mars your names will be talked about
for a long time your kids and their kids will say
that you saved them from slavery

  but dutch was inspired he appealed to other
emotions than vanity he appealed to appetites as
well

  the men of mars are soft and juicy think of
the great feast you will have they cant hurt
you and you can eat them without waiting for
scales to get loose go and lead the gang to the
big feed

  meebroo and grroo bloated with dignity and
self pride but the ex-king was a man of action
without waiting for their assent he called loudly
for others to come and presently there were over
two hundred of the clattering monsters assembled

  meebroo and grroo are great guys they are

going to lead you to a great feed dutch told them
in loud tones the terrible men of mars have come
to make slaves of you and i am going to keep you
free now go

  the deluded leaders needed no further urging
for they now stood undeniably far in advance of
their fellows they bellowed orders with pomposi-
ty and then led the column out of the jungle and
down into the valley of hills

chapter vi
battle

dutch stood at the edge of the jungle to watch
the proceedings he was a little conscience-
stricken over the trouble he was causing still
he mused as he attempted to still the mocking
voice of conscience dana is in danger and hes
worth more than two ship loads of men of mars
put together oh well the martians would get
eaten up anyway so why do more with em than
just fill bellies

  the attacking column had strung out and was
winding through the little valleys among the hills
sometimes they were lost to his sight and then
they would reappear farther in the distance dutch
could see them ford the river and climb into the
valleys on the other side of the stream their
clatter was becoming lost in the distance

  evidently the men of mars had not seen them
for they continued to pour out of the ship and wan-
der farther and farther from the flyer dutch
reasoned that they could not hear the rattle of the
scales for they were too close to the roaring steam
from the outcropping radium

  other neptunians now began to join the attack
pouring out of the jungle from all sides and drop-
ping out of sight among the hills

  the ex-king climbed a little hill that he might
view the impending battle with greater ease he
dared not go closer for he feared that the martians
might use a death ray although the ray had no
effect upon the battlers of neptune dutch himself
respected the apparatus with all the fear of past
experience and training

  the two leaders of the attack were just leaving
the last gulley and emerging upon the plain dutch
became tense he saw the martians point to the
attackers and apparently hail one another they
ran toward their ship but some of them had wan-
dered too far and were cut off before the victims
could enter their flyer and close the doors the pon-
derous horde was upon them

  a brilliant point of green light appeared on the
side of the space flyer another and another blink-
ed on and dutch knew that the death rays were
playing upon the scaly monsters he imagined the
consternation of the martians when they found
that their most effective weapon was useless

  some of the neptunians had gained the door and
were fighting for entrance while others were catch-
ing and eating the stragglers who had been cut off
other hordes of dutchs kingdom were drawing up
and throwing themselves into the fight

 suddenly a puff of moke flared from the side of
the flyer and almost immediately a shell burst in
the midst of the attackers scales and monsters
the struggle for neptune

flew in every direction the ex-king was amazed
he did not know that the martians had adopted the
cannon of the earthians

  the neptunians fell back under this unexpected
attack but dutch could see two of them waving the
others on again he judged that these must be
meebroo and grroo heroically garnishing their
names with glory for future historians to struggle
over

  another shell was fired it struck one of the
leaders fairly amidships and scattered him in a
glory of spectacular fireworks

  the attackers appeared incensed over this want-
on destruction for they surged in a savage mob
that swept everything before it two more guns
opened rapid fire and tore great gaps in the ad-
vancing tide but they might as well have tried to
dig a hole in the ocean the gaps immediately
filled up and the neptunians trampled over their
dead as they rushed savagely on

  dutch was appalled there was nothing refined
about this carnage he had instigated yet it was
more effective than he had anticipated

  the green lights had blinked out and the ex-king
knew that the martians had turned off their death
rays and were concentrating upon their guns

  the neptunians gained the door and attempted
to enter but the martians had hastily mounted
one of the three inch guns just inside and now it
went into action although they could not get the
door closed against the three neptunians who held
it open they could defend the opening the gun
tore a great hole in the advancing column almost
instantly the neptunians closed in and continued
forward but the gun spoke again and another gap
appeared as if by magic again the attackers
closed in but they were nearer to the door and
now two of them got in before the next shell tore
through the ranks the gun suddenly went dead
and the horde surged into the flyer one by one
the guns became silent dutch imagined the feast
that was under way behind the steel shell of the
space flyer

alls quiet

the hubbub subsided and dutch recovered
himself he decided that it was safe for him
to take the situation in hand and assume the glory

  he bounded down the hill and ran through the
valleys among the hills quickly he forded the
river and then gasped up the other slope at last
he gained the plateau just as the triumphant nep-
tunians were coming out of the ship gnawing
bones and bellowing triumphantly dutch ran up
to them and commanded their attention with a
wave of his scepter

  where are meebroo and grroo he asked

  dead one of the neptunians bellowed

  a great peace came over dutch indeed the
battle had been a greater success than he had
dared anticipate he reveled in his good fortune
for a moment and then bethought himself of his
duties

  these terrible men of mars came to make
slaves of you he bellowed boastfully but i have



delivered you i have saved you the trouble of be-
ing slaves ive come to make a great nation out
of this were going to dig radium and help the
earthians get around faster look at me i hold
the red light and show you how to keep out of
slavery i am king a great king

  the victors were deeply impressed they grov-
elled before their benevolent king they tried in
every way to show their appreciation

  now ordered the king roll this ship into the
lake

  a thousand willing shoulders pushed on the steel
flyer and rolled it to the crest of the slope an-
other shove and the sphere rolled down the slope
gathering momentum until it hurtled out over the
lake and broke the surface with a tremendous
splash slowly it sank amid a great confusion of
boiling foam and bubbles

  now the monarch commanded pick up all
the bones and throw em into the lake

  this was done with much groveling and at-
tempts to please

  now pick up your own dead and beat it he
ordered

  when the vast procession had clattered into the
jungle to another orgy of dance and feast in the
grotto the king selected a rock on which he sat
down to rest and congratulate himself

  many sleeps went by and the satiated mons-
ters returned to do homage to their king and
the king taught them many things

  at last dana returned with his fleet twenty
doughnut shaped flyers broke through the black
cloud canopy and fluttered gently to the ground
a steel door in the flagship banged open and dana
himself ran out he shook hands with the mon-
arch of neptune

  its good to see you again he greeted i
have worried about you ever since we left did
you have trouble

  not a bit said the king to prove it he waved
his scepter three times and fifty thousand mons-
ters drew into line and bowed until their foreheads
touched the ground

  dana was impressed

  did you see anything of a ship from mars he
asked presently

  no said the king why

  nothing only they had a big jail break there
and the escaped prisoners stole a space flyer i
thought that they might come here since every
planet has been warned by radio to watch for
them there is a little matter of a hundred thous-
and dollars reward for their capture

  the king staggered a moment and then looked
out over the placid lake then the king became
placid oh well i couldnt spend it here any-
way he muttered

  beg pardon said dana i didnt catch that
ii asked you if you brought my smokes
dutch started

  there are a hundred thousand cigarettes in
number two ship

  oh boy lead me to em gee everything
that i try to do turns out big and fine lets go

secret

of the

tomb
the secret of the tomb

i sat complacently reading in my study heed-
less of the storm raging outdoors my butler
had retired more than an hour before the
clock on the mantel was striking the half hour
glancing up i saw that it was eleven-thirty i
had to leave for london the next morning at six

  i put down the medical journal i had been
reading and arose from the deeply-cushioned
chair and at that moment the
phone bell in the hall rang
sharply

  i am a physician by profes-
sion and i certainly was not
particularly eager to be called
out on such a night as this

reluctantly i crossed the hall
to the phone the flash of
the lightning and the crash of
the thunder were terrible

  taking up the receiver i
gave the usual ello the
voice on the phone startled
me it was the voice of al-
fred stewart a very dear
friend of mine whom i had
supposed until that moment to
be in egypt

  al i said when in thun-
der did you get back and
why have you
waited until now to
tell me

  sorry old man i
ju-crash a bolt
of thunder stopped
our conversation
momentarily

  as i was say-
ing he resumed

i just arrived an
hour ago youre
the first to know
that im back

 yes al i
said but i can
hardly hear you for
the static interfer-
ence

 donald for
gods sake i am
not paying social
respects i want to
see you immediate-
ly i came all the
way from egypt to
talk with you

youll have to come to my apartments immediate-
ly at -st

  but good lord al i cant now you see-
but he had already hung up

  i was at first inclined to think he was well
a little off but his tone was urgent serious
pleading i rebelled at going two miles on a wild
night like this but somehow i knew i had to and
that i would	n

  i put on a storm coat and rubbers and swallow-
ed a whiskey and soda putting on my cap i
descended to the street it was wild and desert-
ed the street looking like a canal i proceeded

upstreet the wind whipping the rain in my face
i was filled with resentment toward alfred stew-
art

   after covering half the distance on foot i fin-
ally managed to hail a cab arriving at -

st i paid the driver and proceeded up to the
door i delivered a series of hard knocks tbe
door opened and before me stood my handsome
friend in a smart smoking jack-
et and finely pressed trousers

  my manner was exceedingly
brusque not the customary at-
titude in which to greet a long
absent friend

  al i said why on earth
must you play me a trick like
this what have i done to de-
serve it my mood was slow-
ly softening under his presence

  he laughed lightly and took
my coat and cap coming
back to the room he offered me
cigarettes lighting one him-
self he started to pace before
the fireplace he seemed und-
er a high nervous tension

  i eyed him closely he
seemed the same old al in all
but one respect the happy
carefree look was
gone

  he stopped his
pacing and drew
up a chair close to
mine his hands
fidgeted nervously
with a magazine

  donald i dont
know where to be-
gin it all isnt
clear yet even in
my own mind my
god its terrible
impossible

  i say al how
about informing me
as to why i was
called here tonight

like to know

will gain more ter-
rible information
from me this night
than in all the oth-
er nights you have
ever lived in the first place i could confide to
no one else what i am about to tell you if i did
i would be considered crazy or called an abomin-
able liar of course there are others who know
of what i am about to relate to you but they are
in egypt ever watchful they are not in eng-
land

   listen and i will tell you the most incredible
story you have ever heard so impossible that
sometimes i think im in some weird fantastic
dream but first don old man pledge me your
assistance in this terrible deal if you ever

r crossley arnold

 it is a well known fact that ancient egypt was
 one of the original centers of civilization and
 that much of our knowledge of the physical uni-
 verse we owe to the egyptians

   but many secrets that the egyptians possessed
 are still mysterious to us-for example their meth-
 od of preserving their dead for five thousand years
 the method that they used to build their gigantic
 pyramids etc and it is quite possible that many
 more powers of nature were known to egyptian
 scientists and perished with them

   suppose it were possible for us occidentals to
 penetrate into the heart of the scientific knowledge
 possessed by the egyptians what marvelous things
 we might find for example it is not a far fetched
 conclusion that if they knew how to preserve their
 dead against corruption they might have known
 how to preserve their living people against death

   this is the theme that our author takes and we
 must say that he has an astounding knowledge of
 his subject and is able with it to give us a fast-
 moving and thrilling story


	wonder stories quarterly

wanted to help your fellow man nows your
time

  i hereby set down as correctly as i can alfred
stewarts story of his terrible discoveries

an unexpected meeting

i will go back two years stewart began
back to a certain night im sure you remember
well that evening not long before i left eng-
land we were discussing a topic familiar to you
microbiology we were discussing i believe a
certain bacillus and its relation to domestic ani-
mals and man a scientist at that time told of
the terrifying results of a newly discovered poi-
son a product of a certain bacillus so powerful
that a tiny spoonful would bring swift death to a
million people

  well i mentioned to you the terrible results
that would follow the spread of such a bacillus
little did i realize that night that i was destined
to make the terrible discoveries i have thank
god however that i came across them when i
did though i am as yet unable to do anything
to remedy the terrible situation as it exists

  that night walking home i kept thinking of
this bacillus though i dont know why for im
an archaeologist not a biologist arriving home
i proceeded to my study pulling down a book
dealing with the lower forms of life i let it fall
open as i sank in my chair the place at which
it fell open caused me no thought then but many
times since i have thought of it that passage
described bacilli that might appear apparently
lifeless and inert but when exposed to certain
favorable conditions became active and resumed
their normal life functions

  a week later while glancing through an eve-
ning rapfer i saw a cairo dispatch headline that
immediately claimed my attention

doctors puzzled by new mysterious disease
lungs and eyes of natives affected
all cases prove fatal

  this headline strangely affected me ordin-
arily i would have paid no attention to it but my
mind had been dwelling on such things for the
past week and this news somehow fascinated me

  returning home i read through the entire ar-
ticle it seems that the mysterious malady had
seized some of a group of egyptian natives who
had just returned from an archaeological expe-
dition only five natives were affected over
a hundred men had worked for the expedition
and only five had been stricken government
inquiries proved that the natives who were strick-
en had lived under the same conditions as those
who were not affected

  shortly after this i had occasion to go to paris
while there i went with a friend to the louvre to
see some recent additions in the assyrian and
egyptian rooms while we were examining a
rather peculiar mummy we made a chance ac-
quaintance with a merry little fellow he was
an egyptologist and very enthusiastic on learn-
ing we were archaeologists of a sort he was be-
side himself with delight he talked english
fairly well but when he became excited he di-

verged off into french his name we found to
be dr paul peri

  we wandered to different exhibits as we talk-
ed it seems that dr peri was very indignant
with certain of our foremost egyptologists he
had written a paper on the biological knowledge
of the ancient egyptians a paper which had
caused considerable unfavorable comment

  as we talked we wandered back to where we
had met and i called dr peris attention to the
peculiar mummy case it did not follow the pat-
tern of the period and the hands on the case held
a scroll below the arms of the case were fig-
ures that were not as far as i could see accord-
ing to the usual egyptian manner there were
several figures apparently in a temple one
carried something that looked like a chemists
test tube two other figures were standing be-
fore a table on which lay the body of another
person apparently dead but the scene portrayed
wasnt one of embalming specialists of the
museum could not give a satisfactory answer for
the figures

  i asked dr peri what he thought about it and
he immediately said it was a scene in some un-
known egyptian laboratory upon questioning
him further he admitted he couldnt give a really
plausible explanation

  as we left dr peri invited us to his apartment
for dinner having nothing else to do we ac-
cepted after dinner as we sat with our wine
and cigars our conversation started along scien-
tific lines once more while dr peri was show-
ing us some of his rare and curious objects he
popped a question that came like a thunderbolt
out of a clear sky he asked us to join him in a
trip to egypt we both said it would be impos-
sible but my friend double-crossed me by telling
dr peri i had nothing to do but follow my arch-
aeological pursuits and that i had more money
than brains anyway as a result was that dr
peri concentrated all his efforts on me when i
left his house i was booked to sail for egypt with-
in the fortnight

  without bothering you with details we will pro-
ceed to egypt we did not stay at alexandria
but moved up to cairo immediately it took us
nearly a week to arrange our affairs and to get
our equipment in readiness dr peri wished to
start immediately for certain step-pyramids

  while in cairo i made inquiries about the five
unfortunate natives and learned that all had died
under most peculiar circumstances i also
learned something else that did not help my peace
of mind the natives who had died had been
with an expedition that was working in the very
place to which we were going somehow i did
not like the place though i had never been there

  finally the last of our equipment arrived and
we organized our expedition from the sur-
rounding district we hired ten arab and egypt-
ian boys who had all been with archaeological
expeditions before and were experienced in this
work

  when we finally set out i had a feeling or
rather a premonition of making much more than
solely archaeological discoveries
the secret of the tomb	

chapter ii
forebodings of evil

on the second day i happened to notice
three of the egyptians conversing together
to this i paid no attention whatever until i acci-
dentally caught certain words the men were
of course not speaking in english but i under-
stood enough of their dialect to grasp what they
were saying what i heard was this evil place
many die camel die too ah evil

  i passed on without indicating i had overheard
them but the conversation troubled me for
superstitions among the men are apt to break
their morale

  the next day i called one of the three to my
tent he was suspicious but i allayed his fears
after talking with him for a while about our
equipment i fired a question at him quite unex-
pectedly of what were you talking last night
of evil places and many dying

  he appeared flustered at first but regaining
his composure he looked straight at me and re-
plied

  it is true master many die the government
knows not or lays the death to other things but
the gods are angry with desecration of sacred
things it is an evil place

  what i said is an evil place this

  no master the tombs to which we go

  how what whats that say man what
are you talking about

  it is not wise to go to the tombs now the
dead are angry

  enough of this go back to your tent and
keep your mouth shut on such matters hereafter
the man looked defiant for a moment but he
turned and went out a new problem faced me
ideas such as his might turn out very harmful
more than one archaeological expedition had fail-
ed because of increasing fears of the natives i
determined to take the matter in hand immed-
iately

  i first thought of calling dr peris attention
to the trouble we faced but knowing how ex-
citable he was i decided to deal with the men
myself and the quicker the better

  i sent our tent boy to gather the men together
when they were assembled in front of my tent i
stepped out before them

  every one here i snapped being answered
in the affirmative i continued talking to the
egyptians first you men were hired to assist
in this expedition you knew where you were
going you accepted is this the first time you
ever visited a tomb you willingly accepted the
advanced pay you have been well treated so
far now when we near our destination you
shirk you let your superstitions overcome you
you would like to go back now and leave the
expedition stranded here no by all the gods
you ever gave fancy to youre going to stay here
the first man i catch doing what he shouldnt
will be dealt with very severely i fingered my
automatic as i spoke these last lines

  i told the same thing to the arabs and then
dismissed them i had seen surprise written on
some faces but now they all knew where they

stood some men would have thought my meth-
ods unwise and would have tried diplomacy but
to my mind such cases need a firm hand

  that evening old dr peri asked me if every-
thing was satisfactory and i nodded so enthusias-
tically that the old duffer returned to his tent
beaming the next evening just before sundown
we came in sight of our destination it was
growing too dark to proceed further so we struck
camp immediately

  after dinner i lit my pipe and walked out of
my tent it was cool and above me the sky glis-
tened with myriad jewels it was a clear night
such as one finds only in a desert i walked
about two hundred yards past our camp and
looked back some of the men were seated
around a low fire a light shown in dr peris
tent where no doubt he was busy with his notes

  then i glanced off to the west at the silhouet-
tes of the step pyramids where we were going
there they stood-mute symbols to mans vanity
four or five thousand years ago the men that
built them ruled this land their names were
known in all the civilized countries of their time
their word was law their armies maneuvered on
this very desert to their subjects they were
gods they caused these tombs to be built for
them temples obelisks and great stone tablets
thinking their glory would live after them true
it has in a sense but in a manner quite different
than the old kings of egypt imagined their
kingdoms have passed through many hands
since they have gone their bodies lie shrunken
or falling into dust the work of their magical
embalmers losing its battle with time

  although i respect the advances made in civi-
lization by the ancient egyptians i could not help
but think of the vanity of their ideas about them-
selves

  as these thoughts ran through my mind i for-
got all about the desert and my surroundings in-
creasing chilliness brought me back to earth i
buttoned up my jacket and started to turn back
but as i did i saw something that caused the
pounding of my heart to quicken

the mysterious light

a s i turned i was facing the tombs across the
desert and as i looked i saw a light a weird
glowing phosphorescent light i stood rigid and
watched it it moved it seemed to travel a
few feet above the ground toward one of the
pyramids

  suddenly it went out as though extinguished
and i gazed at darkness though i was cold i
began to sweat and i started to run for the camp
when i was almost there i ceased running and
started to think what could i say i could
not let the men know i had been frightened by a
weird light and dr peri would think i carried a
flask of spirited brandy after all i thought
there was probably a plausible explanation to
that strange sight

  walking over to dr peris tent where a light
was still burning inside i looked in the old dod-
ger was writing as though his life depended on it
he never saw me and i dropped the flap door
	wonder stories quarterly

and went around to where some of the men were
still sitting

  i called our tent boy to me and inquired if any
of the men had left the camp in the last hour
he shook his head no one had left the camp
all evening except myself i walked away in
deep thought then what was the meaning of
that light i felt sure that someone carried it
but who no one in our camp and there had
been no other people here that i knew of since
that last expedition had returned

  i entered my tent in a troubled state of mind
and then suddenly remembered my workmans
sinister account of the place i did not sleep
well that night being troubled by strange
dreams

  i awoke the next morning little refreshed for
the day ahead of me while dressing the inci-
dent of the night before ran through my mind
and with it the egyptians words it is evil
place many die there

  when i completed my toilet i went to peris
tent he gave me a cheery greeting and then
noticed my haggard appearance

  aha you did not sleep so well in love
no i laughed not hardly just didnt feel
so well

  you would like the tonic yes

  no no tonic ill be all right soon

  well sir its your disease not mine but re-
member we have much work for today

  after we had breakfasted i returned to my
own tent to arrange things for the day we had
decided upon moving ahead immediately to
where we were to establish our permanent camp
during our investigations i had to always hand-
le our equipment and its movement myself as dr
peri would only be in the way

  along about ten in the morning everything
was ready to move coming up to what we
thought was a desirable and convenient place
we decided to make our camp there in the ear-
ly forenoon one can be active but around one
oclock the heat grows intense i however kept
the men going until we had completed the laying
out of the camp- with the exception of a few min-
or details

  after satisfying myself that everything was
all right i walked over to dr peri well doc
we settled down in good time dont you think
peri nodded then i put a sudden question
dr peri i said what do you think was
really wrong with the five men stricken by that
peculiar malady

  bah put no belief in the malady they work-
ed under bad conditions no doubt

  i said no more but walked toward the objects
or our research although i had not been in this
place before i was familiar with the order i had
gone up the river to memphis where in gizeh i
had explored around the pyramids of the old
kingdom royalty

  the pyramids are surrounded by the so-called
mastaba tombs of nobles and officials the word
mastaba is arabic and means bench and it well
describes the flat-topped steep-sided super-struc-
tures of these tombs within the mastaba is a
chapel this being sometimes expanded into a ser-

ies of rooms here the priests raised prayers to
the gods and here food offerings were left the
dead themselves however lay in sarcophagi far
underground in chambers reached by shafts as
much as a hundred feet deep

  our camp lay just east of one of these masta-
bas as i walked around i found that our pre-
decessors had camped to the southwest of a
mastaba on the other side of the pyramid that
they had departed hastily was quite evident i
completed my tour and returned to our camp

  dr peri was not in sight and the men were
idling around but though they had nothing to
do i thought the absence of merriment among
them was strange i called ali the tent boy and
told him to prepare my shaving outfit he too
though usually quite cheerful looked very som-
bre

  after finishing shaving and when i had com-
pleted some notes i lit a pipe and stood in the
door of my tent the sun was sinking low in
the sky as i looked across at the tombs i had
an uneasy feeling as if i were being watched by
someone or something none of the men were
in sight and dr peri was in his tent no doubt i
knocked out my pipe and walked over to his tent

chapter iii
an alarming statement

going into his tent i found that he was out
and as i stepped out one of the arabs
passed by i stopped him and asked him if he
had seen the doctor the doctor went to look
over the tombs soon after i did the man said and
had not returned yet i wondered that i had
not seen him and started back towards the tombs
i had gone half the distance around when i saw
him on the southwest side he was on his knees
with a large reading glass in his hands

hello doc studying geology he started
and looked up but seeing me resumed his work

  whats up i resumed lose a valuable

  no-i am becoming interested in biology
  oh

  he rose to his feet pocketed his glass and
mopped his brow stewart he said do you
notice anything queer here

  why why no not exactly

  well i do

  what i asked trying hard to appear calm

  in the tent i will tell he said strangely

  as we walked back towards the camp my
pulse-beat quickened with excitement what
i thought had the doctor seen the mysterious
light too in silence we walked straight to dr
peris tent inside i sat down and began fan-
ning myself as dr peri put away hi glass his
movements struck me as peculiar they seemed
so deliberate i watched him and finally he
came over to me and sat down on a camp stool

  mr stewart you have seen nothing peculiar
nothing

  well yes i- no now i have not either

come to think

  you are sure then

  yes quite sure
the secret of the tomb	

  ah my friend you are not what you would
call observant

 and why

  were you ever in these desert before
  yes

  ah good then i presume you are familiar
with some of its conditions yes

why yes i know something about the desert
marvelous my friend now we are getting
some place in the desert it is what you call
peculiar different from the other places for
instance there is much stillness

  doctor i dont quite comprehend

  i said in a desert there is much stillness but
not all is stillness even in the barren desert there
is some action animal action

  still doctor i dont see

  in all deserts there is some life but here there
is none

  say that again i rose to my feet excited

  he motioned me to my chair

  please it is peculiar here we find no life but
ourselves my friend sometimes you have the
thick skull listen i will say so even you will
comprehend after i was here but a very short
while i noticed a funny thing a peculiar still-
ness nothing is astir i look further and lo and
behold i find no animal life it seems funny so
i investigate and find i am right these place
has no animal life excepting that of our expedi-
tion not even the insect

  but what is the reason for this do you fear
something

  i did not say we should fear something just
want to call your attention to this peculiar phen-
omena

  doctor i think there is something sinister
about this place i confessed finally

  come now come we will have dinner and
retire early

trouble comes in a strange form

that night i tossed in my sleep uneasily
strange and fantastic ideas entered my
mind again i experienced that peculiar and
unpleasant feeling that something watched me
watching and waiting i awoke next morning
with a troublesome headache i felt all in and
my brain seemed dull i took some tablets and
dressed as  was straightening my cot dr
peri entered

  good morning my friend you look ill

  bon jour doctor i feel as bad as i look
  beaux yeux ar the ladies man is lonely
  dont be absurd

  oh well pardon my jests come to my tent
i will give you the tonic

  devil take the tonic

  bien breakfast in one half hour then you
work

  i felt so badly i took hardly any food and i
did not feel very much like outlining and organ-
izing our work however dr peri and i went
out and instructed the men as to the first steps to
be taken then accompanied by two men we
proceeded to the tombs dr peri had pretty
well in mind the outline of our work for he
thought he could find material at these tombs to

back up some of his theories he therefore in-
tended working on every mastaba in the locality
besides the pyramids

  we reached the mastaba on the northeast
where peri had decided we should start

  this one had not been touched by other arch-
aeologists and looked a promising prospect
after two hours survey we found that it would
take a few days to gain entrance

  going back to the camp i suggested to peri
that we might work over the other mastabas
but he shook his head deeming it wiser to stick
to one at a time

  the next three days were spent in hard work
under a blazing sun we made good progress
though and by the end of the third day after
commencing the work we had all the debris clear-
ed away during this time i saw or heard noth-
ing unusual and my peculiar feeling left me
moreover the men were now taking a heart in
the work

  that night however the peace we were en-
joying was rudely disturbed for at about ten
oclock one of the arabs came running into my
tent

  master-the camels someone is among
them

 who

  i could not see well but ahmet he sees too
i picked up my savage and ran out of the tent
toward the camels some of the men followed
me and i told one to get dr peri when i reach-
ed the camels i couldnt see anyone or anything
in sight one arab carried a brand and i held it
up but it revealed nothing the camels ap-
peared to be very agitated however

  dr peri came running up flushed with excite-
ment

  what-what ees happen

  oh nothing some cursed jackel or something
has frightened the camels

  jackal here no no my friend no jackal
oh well whatever it was its gone no use
waiting here

  as we returned peri followed me to my tent
inside he looked around as though he expected
to see something then he came and stood be-
fore me

  my friend you were right these ees a sinister
place last night i walk out of my tent toward
tombs all at once i see-

  you saw a weird phosphorescent like light
he appeared surprised how did you
know he asked

  i saw it myself on the eve of our arrival here
but i said nothing thinking you would ridicule
me

  my friend something very mysterious devil-
ish lies behind that light its bearer disturbed
our camels not a jackal

  my god peri what is it who or what
would be carrying a light among tombs and for
what purpose

  ah my friend as in everything else there is
much to be learned but tomorrow we will look
at other mastabas

  again a night of fitful restlessness of fantas-
tic dreams and fantasies the next morning i
again had a bad headache and i realized if i kept
	wonder stories quarterly

losing my sleep i would ruin my health i
dressed myself wearily and rubbing a hand across
my face  felt a stubby growth of beard for
the past two or three days i had been too busy
to shave and now i was too weary

  at breakfast i found that dr peri had laid
out the plans for the examination of the other
tombs

  we will examine each mastaba in its turn
maybe we find something maybe we dont

  it was mid-afternoon when we came to the
mastaba on the southeast it was here that the
last expedition had worked in view of the fact
that the other expedition had worked here so
recently i was surprised to find so much debris
around we searched about for an hour but saw
nothing unusual except that it did not look as
though an expedition had been working there
recently i remarked about this to peri who also
thought it odd

  when we finally came back to camp it was
growing dusk i was fatigued and wanted
rest i ate a little dinner and went to my tent
while putting by some of my tools that i had been
using i noticed that my dynamo flashlight was
missing then i remembered it had been in my
kit and not needing it i had laid it aside and for-
gotten it

  i did not wish to leave it there all night and
being exceedingly tired i sent one of the arabs
after giving him a small flashlight to see by

  it was about eight oclock when i sent him off
and when nine oclock came and the man had not
returned i became uneasy i paced back and
forth becoming very agitated finally i rushed
out of my tent and seizing an arab by the neck
i asked if ahmet was around for it was he whom
i had sent the arab appeared bewildered and
said he was not

  i rushed into dr peris tent

  my god doctor a terrible thing must have
happened i sent ahmet for my light an hour
and a half ago and he is not back

  my good friend dont be so excited he prob-
ably could not find it queekly so however we
will look and see

  as we passed out of the tent i noticed peri car-
ried a pistol we called three men and with lan-
terns proceeded to the southwest of the pyramid

  a cold fear gripped me as we approached that
corner again i experienced that feeling of be-
ing watched by unseen eyes the men were
plainly uneasy casting glances off into the dark-
ness i gripped peris arm as we came up to the
point where i left my light

  the reflected rays of the moon showed the
place in eerie weirdness i looked and saw my
flash lying just where i had left it nothing else
was in sight the living breathing man whom i
had sent for my light had absolutely disappeared
leaving not a trace i felt sick this terrible thing
was too much

chapter iv

mutiny

as we returned to camp each one busy with
his own thoughts that feeling of being
watched grew in me i felt as if we were all

doomed when we reached camp the men who
had remained behind gathered excitedly around
their fellows paying no attention to them but
walked off with dr peri

  but i knew that trouble was brewing though
i said not a word to dr peri as i turned to my
tent he grasped my arm listen my boy he said
eagerly tomorrow we go back and we will try
to discover mysterious things yes

   all right old man as you say i replied de-
jectedly i knew dr peri was trying to keep my
spirits up though as alarmed as i in my
tent i sat on my cot and started to ponder on
the arabs mysterious disappearance

  but the more i thought about it the more im-
possible it seemed where could he have gone

what could have hap-ah i jumped and

slapped my hands together i had it now the
answer to several things seemed to come at once

  the southwest corner thats the damned
place i exclaimed aloud

  now it all comes to my mind from that
direction came the light our camels are closer
to it than any other part of our camp there the
fated expedition worked and there is where ah-
met disappeared beyond a doubt

   i felt like rushing immediately to dr peri and
telling him what i thought but decided to wait
till morning so with a feeling akin to triumph
i prepared for bed i felt sure that on the mor-
row i would find the key to these mysterious
doings but i could not dispel the feeling of be-
ing watched however and it made me uncom-
fortable

  i awoke next morning quite refreshed and in
good spirits i arose dressed washed and
shaved and was leisurely putting by my shaving
outfit when ali the tent boy burst in

  master oh master come quick the camels
are dead all dead and asad who watched

  i dropped my kit on the floor i was stung be-
yond belief but i acted quickly wheeling i
seized the frightened lad

  what talk is this i asked him sternly

  the camels master-

   are all dead eh well by god ill find out what
this games all about today or die does dr peri
know yet

  yes master he is coming to your tent at
that moment dr peri burst in

  mon dieu have you heard all our fine camels
and faithful asad

  yes have you seen them

   no but lets go quickly

  with peri tagging after me i ran all the way
to where the camels were there strewn before
me were our animals and a little way off asad
as dr peri came up he looked sorrowful but
said nothing i was quivering with rage and
despair

  who what did this thing and for what pur-
pose

  i know not he mumbled come though
and lets look over the handiwork we walked
over to asad he lay face down in the sand his
legs stretched out one arm doubled under his
body and the other stretched out at right angles
to it around him in the sand were no signs of
struggle
the secret of the tomb	

  we turned him over on his face was no mu-
tilation but an expression that will haunt me to
my dying day it was terrible i hope never to see
the like of it again it was contorted contorted
with fear the mouth gaped open the lips
drawn over the teeth the nostrils were wid-
ened and the eyes my god those eyes how they
stared in unspeakable horror we examined him
thoroughly and no mark of violence or poisoning
did we find he had died of terror

  the camels we found to be poisoned on the
hind quarter of one i found a small wound ex-
amining the rest i found similar punctures at
the same place a hypodermic needle i an-
nounced

  peri nodded but believed that it must have
been a very thick needle i turned to look at the
bodies again and then turned to the men

  bear asad back to my tent and bury these
camels

  the men did not move but stood and looked at
me

  did you hear me obey a tall arab
stepped out and in even tones aid no more will
we obey you infidel no more

  he turned and addressed the others

  too long have we listened to unbelieving
dogs long since should we have gone back
two are now taken for disobedience wilt thou
waif longer

  a murmur ran through the men the egyp-
tians were not sons of allah but they feared the
vengeance of the dead kings whom they still re-
vered and they joined the arabs against us

  mutiny was breaking out at last dr peri im-
mediately became flustered and started stammer-
ing to the men i told him to be still and stepped
out a pace i began in tones as even as those of
the arab

  no doubt you fully remember my warning to
deserters it still is a warning for deserters in
no way are we to blame for these happenings
we shall punish the offenders as we find them
you men however remain till we dismiss you
furthermore any participating in further mutin-
ous outbursts will be turned over to the authori-
ties on our return with no further pay

  the spokesman became furious

  christian swine you will never return

  he and two others stepped quickly towards us
knives drawn they meant business i stepped
back very quickly

  crack-crack-my automatic spoke twice and
the leader lay in the sand two bullets through
him

  the other two stopped and stood as statues
dr peri was swept off his feet by the turn of
events i told him to stay by me and keep his
mouth shut the men drew off in a group talk-
ing excitedly covering them with the gun i
walked over to them

  any one else wish to leave camp

  i received no answer

  very well every one wishes to stay good
now you have your orders obey them

  i sent dr peri and ali back to camp and then
stood over the men till they picked up the two
bodies and bore them back to camp i then per-

sonally supervised the burying of the camels
when back in camp i told the men to go about
their respective duties till further notice i then
went to dr peris tent

  when i entered the poor fellow nearly fell
down his work had been comparatively quiet
that in all his life he never came across trouble
such as this

  forced to kill our own men he moaned
mon dieu what is next

  quiet yourself doctor it is not our fault i
tried to avoid it but it was either them or our-
selves

  i know but this is too terrible the authori-
ties what will we say what can we do

  everything in its time doctor but now we
will get at the bottom of this thing

  we cant now we will have to go back be-
sides we are short-handed

  no by god we will see this thing through
even if we two only remain further we will
start things popping right off number one bury
the men and then start at the bottom of this
thing besides i added i dont want wind of
this spread all around

  as you say my friend i depend all on your
advice

trapped

that afternoon saw the burial of the two
arabs with that completed i busied myself
with preparations for our investigation of the
southwest mastaba when ali told me to watch
the men and not to trust them i took this for good
advice

  the next morn the dawn of a day i shall never
forget we started work on the mastaba the fiery
orb of the sun promised to be merciless and not a
wisp of wind blew in the desert i worked the
men unceasingly ali and i laboring like slaves

  it seemed that except for the work which we
had done ourselves the mastaba had not been
touched for hundreds of years we labored and
sweated and performed engineering feats with
ali carrying supplies six men and ourselves do-
ing the work i think we set a record for accom-
plishment although the mastaba was on the
ground gaining entrance was not easy for part of
the outside had given way and the entrance was
completely covered i knew then that the other
expedition had not gained entrance to the mas-
taba

  when four oclock came we finally entered the
mastaba going from bright sunlight into pitch
darkness we could not see well even with our
lamps first i btumbled and hurt my knees
then we realized a peculiar fact though we were
away from the fresh air we encountered no foul
air here the mastaba contained fresh air this
astounding fact seemed to confirm me in my
strange doubts about the place

  then as we looked around we found ourselves
in a vestibule ahead was the entrance to an-
other chamber into which we passed and found
ourselves in a long narrow room at the center
of this opened another entrance these rooms
were entirely bare even to decorations as we
	wonder stories quarterly

passed into the third chamber dr peri suddenly
sprawled full length turning my lamp on him
i found he had tripped on a small statuette i
passed my light around the room and found we
were in the tomb chapel a room about twelve feet
long and nine wide here the walls were decor-
ated set near the corners were the figures one
of which dr peri had tripped over in the cen-
ter were ancient food offerings an exit was at
the end and this passed into a chamber contain-
ing religious objects used by the priests

 coming back into the tomb chapel i spoke to
 dr peri nothing seems to be unusual here
 no my friend nothing as yet

 oh well i said let things come as they may
 i say though wonder where the shaft to the bur-
 ial chamber is the door i suppose is merged in
 with the wall

 i think we had better let that go until tomor-
 row what time is it

 only four thirty im going to have a look for
 that door i said adventurously where do you
 suppose it is likely to be

 right here in the chapel itself

 taking up a hand pick and using the handle i
 started to test the wall suddenly i stopped
 doc come here ive found it

 seems to be may be false

 by george im going to take it down today
 better wait its getting late

 oh no call in the men

 the six came into the tomb chapel

 wheres ali

 to camp for water

 well now i said i want you to chisel around
 here where i mark

 they began and with myself doing the delicate
 work we soon were deep into the red sandstone
 dr peri was nervous but he finally joined us
 be careful stewart dont spoil that work
 suddenly i decided to quit work for the day
 and told the men they might stop we were all
 still standing in the chapel when as i was stoop-
 ing to pick up my helmet i swung the head of
 the pick against the wall

 careful stewart youll----

 the words were cut short in his mouth and we
 started back there before our amazed eyes a
 part of the wall as if it were a door revealing
 intense darkness

 a secret door i gasped i must have struck
 some secret panel in the wall with the pick

 we turned the rays of our lights into the open-
 ing but they revealed nothing

 im going in i announced determinedly
 careful boy careful

 i passed in dr peri following me once inside
 we were better able to see the room seemed about
 the size of the tomb chapel

 suddenly peri shouted

 here here is the shaft

 i was at one end of the room and as i turned
 i sprawled again my light flew from my grasp
 but i regained it and turned the rays on what i
 had fallen over

 why heres the shaft i said

 what did you say said peri coming over

 heres the shaft

 no its over there

 i stood up and looked at peri and then we look-
 ed at the floor and cried in amazement there
 were two shafts

 we examined them and found one in much bet-
 ter condition than the other

 damned strange i wonder----

 click

 we turned and to our horror found the entrance
 was closed

chapter v

the mystery reveals itself in pari

 tahat devils game is this

 vv dr peri walked over to the door sudden-
 ly he exclaimed mon dieu come here listen

 i moved closer and then stood aghast

 from the tomb chapel came curses and cries
 of terror from the men finally there was
 coughing and then silence not another sound
 came from the tomb chapel

 i stood trembling from head to foot horror
 stricken

 lord peri whats happened in there

 peri stood still and silent gazing at the place
 we had come in by

 my son he said slowly i deeply regret hav-
 ing brought you into this terrible thing i dont
 think we shall ever see daylight alive

 doctor do you think some outlaw gang has
 taken possession of these tombs

 i fear something worse

 worse

 come my son lets examine this chamber i
 fear our men have gone as the rest

 as we started to examine the chamber i felt
 more strongly than ever the feeling of being
 watched the chamber revealed nothing and we
 finally drew towards the two shafts

 these shafts why two i said and why is
 it that one appears much less dilapidated

 i know not

 i wonder if we can get the cover off these
 shafts

 i think said dr peri if thats what you
 want we could divert our attention to this appar-
 ently neglected one

 i went down on my hands and knees

 i wonder if there is another button around
 here

 no but here is a ring

 hmm doesnt seem attached to anything on
 the cover shall we pull on it

 and why not

 we grasped it and gave it a good jerk and sim-
 ultaneously up flew the cover

 i was surprised at the ease with which it came
 up for it was a massive thing we still had our
 revolvers and we instinctively clutched them then
 we trained our lights down the opening

 down before us stretched a flight of steps that
 lost themselves in the darkness

 doctor peri should we venture down

 and why not

 all right im ready
the secret of the tomb	

  when we started down i took out my pistol
the stairs seemed without end down down
down we went the blackness surrounding us was
complete in the deathly silence our footsteps
echoed hollowly around us

  i say the air is quite fresh this is very
peculiar fresh air in a place like this

  finally we reached the bottom the stairs
seemed to end in a small room and looking around
i saw an entrance or exit at one end i moved to-
ward it dr peri following right behind me the
opening was quite wide i turned to peri and was
about to speak when we heard a distant click

  the cover i cried springing towards the
stairs

  peri however held me back

  its no use stewart

oh the fools we are to be trapped twice
what difference does it make peri said
we were surely trapped above by the first one
but i protested above we knew where we
were and ali might have helped us

  ila do you think any one could come near this
place and live if they were wanted dead
what do you mean

  when i said you had a thick skull i was right
do you think ail these happenings are coinci-
dences no some superior intelligence is at
work it can see everything

  but why is a harmless expedition attacked
so

  who knows lets go into this chamber

  we cautiously went in and found ourselves in
a room apparently larger than in which we had

yet been suddenly---click

  again i moaned in despair

  evidently we are not intended to escape said
peri turning to the last closed entrance

  this time we were not left long to speculate
around us burst a phosphorescent glow we stood
in a circle about ten feet in diameter entirely
lighted by the eerie luminescence we were per-
fectly illuminated but we could not see beyond
the glow i clutched peris arm and stood staring
into the darkness

  we heard something move in the darkness and
through the circle of light burst a figure a figure
that struck us dumb with amazement

  the figure we beheld was familiar to us in a
certain sense of the word familiar because of our
study of egyptology it was tall the body being
very erect the hips were quite narrow the
angular shoulders the broad forehead and statue-
like features would have marked him for an egyp-
tian anywhere his dark brown handsome face
was surmounted by a miter the rest of his gar-
ments were those of an ancient egyptian priest

  i was thunderstruck as i looked at him he
stood five paces from us and with folded arms
eyes glowing like a cat surveyed us

  then we were startled even further for he be-
gan to speak in englith all details of his speech
did not reach us then for we were too thunder-
struck

  welcome welcome to the tombs abode and
laboratories of sais-amen-tanis if you have

been caused inconvenience pardon we beg your
pardon

  saying this he ceased speaking and looked in-
tently at us then he raised his hands which i
noted were long and slender and heavily decor-
ated with signet and scarab rings and clapped
once the sound echoed and reechoed he then
spoke out in a language which neither dr peri
or i understood immediately there appeared a
gigantic black man with his head shaved clad in
a lion skin he was apparently an ethiopian

  the egyptian spoke to him and then turned to
us

  this is athribis you will accompany him

  the black man turned and we followed in a
daze as we passed out of the chamber into a
sort of corridor the phosphorous light in the
chamber went out and the corridor was lit in its
stead we followed our silent stone-like guide
just as we reached the end a panel swung open
and was passed on through

  although we had been subjected to startling
experiences ever since our arrival the sight that
met our eyes superseded all the rest as we left
the corridor we passed into a terrace a wide mar-
ble terrace it stretched off to our right and
left for considerable distances where it was joined
by two others at right angles it went somewhat
further to the left before it turned all around
as far as i could see were beautiful columns bor-
dering the inner side every few yards a foun-
tain played and from between the columns the
peculiar light issued

  but this was only a small part of what we saw

  beyond the terrace and bordering it as far as
we could see was a channel or moat of water on
the side of the terrace we were on a short flight
of broad steps led down to it and moored to the
last step was a boat an egyptian mortuary boat

  across this moat and hemmed in by it was a
great and very beautiful building if the water
extended all the way around and i felt sure it
did the building was on an island on the side
facing us the lower part rose straight up from
the water and offered no admittance from a boat

  my god i exclaimed to peri i am dreaming
this cant be

  he put his hand on my shoulder and said no
my boy you are not dreaming we have chanced
on a stupendous discovery we see things no man
would believe that person who spoke to us was
an egyptian not one of these modern so-called
egyptians but one of that ancient and noble race

  our guide motioned us to follow him and we
went down the steps to the boat and got in the
craft was a typical mortuary boat on the outside
but altered somewhat inside our guide and
guard stood in the rear and grasped a huge steer-
ing rudder at the front was a small raised deck
and we sat midships on a luxurious divan

  suddenly without warning we were in motion

  whats furnishing the power doc i inquired

  i cant tell and then he looked down at the
water and caught my arm look see the waters
in motion

  i looked and sure enough the boat was being
carried along by the water
	wonder stories quarterly

  we were going down to the left and when we
came to the turn the man with a dexterous move-
ment turned the boat sharply i glanced at the
great structure and saw that there too the lower
part offered no mooring to the boat i then
turned my attention to the terrace to our left

  as i looked i saw something that made me
jump

  look peri i cried pointing peri looked and
turned pale

our enemy turns host

there on a chain that gave him access back
and forth across the terrace was a huge gor-
illa the beast was much larger than any i had
seen in life or in pictures it was a terrifying
monster and its ferocity seemed proportionate
to its size it paid no attention to the boat

  evidently i remarked one must not walk
on the terrace

  as we passed along the water i had a feeling
of being removed as far away from the outside
world as one who travels to mars the more i
looked at it the taore the building seemed a
mighty fortress it seemed so large and strong
as to appear invincible but nevertheless it was
very beautiful as we neared the second turn i
glanced up this whole subterranean wonder was
covered by a white ceiling made apparently of
marble i judged the distance from terrace to
the roof to be about sixty feet

  as we turned my attention was claimed by
more astonishing sights here the terrace and
moat were more highly illuminated the build-
ing on this side was provided with the boat land-
ing where steps came down to the water in a semi-
circle at either end of the semi-circle was an-
other flight of stairs leading to a second floor
along the front of the building stretched a marble
veranda and leading up from the buildings ver-
anda to the top were great columns at the top
of the stairs were two great entrances

  as the boat slid in next to the steps i looked
across at the terrace there i saw a beautiful
pure-white structure which covered the width of
the terrace and extended along it for about fifty
feet from its front bteps led down to the moat

  our guide motioned us out of the boat the
water had ceased its motion and i wondered who
controlled it for evidently it was not our guide
we went up one of the flights of stairs and as we
reached the head the door swung open passing
into a long curved corridor behind our noiseless
guide we emerged into a gorgeously resplendent
room

  by signs our guide made it clear to us that we
were to stay there the chamber was circular ex-
cept at the end at which we stood and about
forty-five feet in diameter

  as our guide proceeded toward the other side
peri and i watched him with deep interest at
the other side of the room was what appeared to
be a great black slab of stone upon which rested
a glass-topped sarcophagus

  our guide approached it very reverently and
upon reaching it he dropped to his knees and

with out-stretched hands bowed his head to the
floor he started praying in a strange tongue
raising hi voice now and then he then arose
and backed away

  finally he turned to us and motioned us to fol-
low him we passed down the side of the cham-
ber and into another room heavily scented with
incense the walls were hung with tapestries
and the furnishings were those of the most lux-
urious ancient egyptian from this we pro-
ceeded to yet another chamber here our guide
quickly left us and a panel slid shut behind him

  the chamber we were in was evidently designed
for sleeping it too was very luxuriously furn-
ished and hung with tapestries a pleasing odor
filled the room

  well peri here we are still alive

  our position is not a light-hearted week-end
trip my friend

  ah peri youre right but we have enough to
think about without worrying

  have you formed any ideas about this place
well i said our host or hosts have a sense
of beauty and as engineers well they rank with
the best of today houdini or any one else
couldnt escape from here by jove if we came
through one we came through a dozen of those
doors that open before and close after you

 bah your ideas listen my poor weak-
minded friend we are in the hands of people of
super-human intelligence who in the wide world
would have conceived such a place its a fan-
tastic as the martian stories but do you realize
the full import of this thing they whose hands
we are in or some of them at least are people of
ancient egypt

  probably descended directly i said casually
for you surely dont think they were actually
members of those races of old egypt do you
must a building fall on you anglo-saxons to
make you see things what ive experienced al-
ready would take all scepticism out of me be-
sides in my scientific papers i always claimed that
the egyptians had a great biological knowledge
i was just about to answer him when a voice
spoke out

  pardon me gentlemen do you find every-
thing comfortable

  we swung around searching for the voice

  do not trouble yourselves as to the origin of
the sound no doubt you are tired and dusty in
that room to your left you will find a bath ath-
ribis will see to your immediate needs

  well i said were evidently watched per-
mit me to bathe

  we went into the room

  i say i exclaimed when i said these chaps
knew luxury and beauty i meant it look at that
pool

  but peri was examining the pool it was sit-
uated in the center of the room from nooks in
the wall issued a peculiar light great divans and
dressing tables bordered the sides of the pool
dr peri stood still and scratched his head

  built throughout of serpentine marble
  rather tip-top what

  as we climbed up the steps from the bath the
the secret of the tomb	

voice said in your chamber you will find gar-
ments put them on and wait

  coming out we found our clothes had disap-
peared and so had our revolvers in place of the
clothes we found some egyptian apparel as we
were dressing i noticed on a small table a colored
glass bottle and two glasses

  ill sample this

  it proved to contain delicious wine

  dr peri was far more interested in the con-
tainer than its contents

  stewart look at this a master-piece in iri-
descent glass-making these glasses too this col-
lection is better than any now known we will
probably learn of the lost art here

  by jove doc youre right well probably see
the solution to many puzzling things cleared up
but we will never tell the world about them

  i then started to make a detailed inspection of
the room one part of it was circularly indented
this indentation also formed the end of the bath
the rest was fairly square in shape the only
openings being the one by which we had entered
and the one that led to the bath the bath was
in reality a walled-off end of the room

  the sleeping couches were gold chairs and
chests were gold plated the floor instead of be-
ing bare was covered by a heavy rug a faint
blueish light was diffused over everything

  as i turned to speak to peri the panel slid open
and the magnificent form of sais-amen-tanis en-
tered after whom the panel slid shut he walked
over to us and with folded arms surveyed us

  i noticed that he carried a large flamboyant dag-
ger attached to a girdle

  ah mr stewart and dr peri did you find
things as you desired

  in this building yes otherwise no what do
you want with us

  that my friend i cannot tell you now still
it is with a purpose of telling you something that
i have come here sit down and listen

  we complied and the egyptian sat down also
then seated in this strange room with us as his
guests or prisoners he unfolded a story such as
mortal man has never before heard

chapter vi

the egyptians story

as you sit before me he began a hundred ques-
tions doubts and fantasies chase through
your brains who am i what is this place what
is the purpose of it these and other questions
you ask yourselves your curiosity shall be sat-
isfied incidentally you will gain more knowledge
of egypt from what i tell you than you would ever
receive from the desecration of our dead

  it is because you disturbed our tombs and our
work that you are here i was driven to drastic
methods before your arrival another group was
here but they too were taken care of one of
your party has preceded you he however came
in rather handy i found use for a certain part of
his brain and his spinal marrow but do not be-
come alarmed no such fate awaits you

  i have a place for you in my plans so fear not
bodily injury you will be well treated and grad-
ually introduced to various objects and plans
escape is impossible as is rescue from the out-
side i shall now endeavor to tell you who i am
and give you some of my history

  i have said my name was sais-amen-tanis
that is not my real name but it has served for
twenty-three hundred years and it need only serve
a little longer before that i had other names but
soon soon after these centuries of waiting ill
resume my own

  you men from your studies know something
of my countrys history you will then be better
able to understand what i am about to tell you

  in the year  before your christ was born i
first saw the light of day my father was a high-
priest of osiris our mighty pharaoh khafra
ruled egypt memphis the capital had no rivals
khafra ruled during the great fourth dynasty
the greatest period of the old kingdom as a boy
i watched the construction of khafras great
pyramid watched it grow up out of the desert
beside the mighty pyramid of khufu i have seen
the sphinx and those great structures in their
glory surrounded by luxurious gardens and mar-
ble tombs nearly five thousand years have pass-
ed but soon i shall see them again as they were

  i was taken into the temples at memphis and
there given the best possible training i was
taught the ways of the temple taught the mystic
rites i was schooled in the sciences and in many
things of which you are ignorant i soon learned
all that the priests and scribes could teach me i
then started to probe into the secrets of nature
farther than any man had ever gone

  there were certain things the priests knew but
didnt understand those things still escape your
modern scientists i probed into the very bowels
of these things and after much research con-
quered them i had all the temple equipment i
put some of my discoveries to use and produced a
fluid that accounts for my being here you know
what metabolism is after a certain length of
time the process of changing dead organic mat-
ter into live cells and the continuous changing of
the live cells and tissue begins to run down i
discovered the secret of the duct glands i pro-
duced cats as large as calves and calves as small
as cats i wrested the secrets of protoplasm from
defiant nature

  i finally produced a fluid that if injected into
the blood stream would keep the body unaltered
for thousands of years it was to be injected at
the prime of life and the only part of the body to
change would be the brain this elixir keeps the
endocrine glands functioning exactly as they were
in the prime of life and when mixed with two
others can even change an animals appearance
these things are some of the most important dis-
coveries i made in those far off days

  i made several lesser discoveries but the secret
of the elixir i shared with none i saw the won-
derful possibilities of the life prolonging fluid and
i inoculated myself i had two intelligent and
faithful slaves and i inoculated them also athri-
bis is one of them
	wonder stories quarterly

  a wife of khafra fell ill and was dying i cured
her i immediately gained great favor with kha-
fra a favor that i gradually increased i did not
accept the high positions offered me for i desired
all my time for experimenting

  however things began to change my father
whom i had not as yet inoculated was killed one
day as he stood near khafras great pyramid he
had gone with other priests and nobles to watch
the completion of the top a block weighing sev-
eral tons became loosened near the top and came
tumbling down as it struck near the bottom it
hurtled out striking my father and killing him
instantly

  my loss was not all i had to bear the suc-
ceeding high priest of osiris was a young man
who had studied in the temple with me he hated
me because of my success he dared not however
express his dislike openly because of my favor
with khafra

  in  b c as you would say khafra passed
on to be judged by osiris and begin his three thou-
sand year wait in his pyramid the passing of
khafra marked the beginning of the end for the
great fourth dynasty and for the old kingdom

  succeeding khafra came shepseskaf who was a
fair ruler but a weak one his power waned more
and more and certain nobles and high priests
aimed to get control high officers of the army
plotted to overthrow him meanwhile shepseskaf
had a young nephew for whom i had a great love
because of his intelligence

  five years after the death of khafra shepses-
kaf was overthrown the man who gained control
was a friend of the high priest of amon and
together they plotted to slay me not forgetting
shepseskafs nephew i took the boy and fled
from memphis to abydos

  i taught the boy everything i knew including
the secrets of the elixirs i inoculated him ten
years later we came back to memphis and over-
threw the usurper i myself reigned as pharaoh
until  b c i then put the boy on the throne
as thamphthis i and he reigned as supreme over
all for five years

  now the northern kings were becoming power-
ful thamphthis could have held out much longer
but i was beginning to work out a gigantic plan
accordingly we spread the news around that
thamphthis had died all preparations for burial
were carried out and the empty mummy-case of
thamphthis was taken to the pyramid of khafra

  the fifth dynasty started under the northern
kings several changes were made some of a
religious order the worship of r began the
fifth dynasty of the delta kings never equaled
that of the fourth dynasty at the end of the
fifth dynasty the nobles and the priests were al-
most as powerful as the pharaoh

  the sixth dynasty was still of the delta kings
the last pharaoh had no power and anarchy set
in this great chaotic period lasted through the
seventh and until the end of the tenth dynasty

down the centuries

during this time i played no active part in
the life of my people being the son of a
high priest i had a mastaba near the pyramid
of khafra my elixir however gave me no use
for it but thamphthis and i wanted a place
where we could work and carry out our great
plan we had a number of faithful associates
loyal subjects of thamphthis and these i inocu-
lated we had as i said before also several
faithful and inoculated slaves

  while egypt was in turmoil we built this place
we selected this site because it was as lonely then
as it is now near the end of the tenth dynasty
we completed it these step-pyramids were
old when i was born

  then came the eleventh dynasty the middle
kingdom and order the capital was now at
thebes memphis had lost its glory but this
period did not last long in the thirteenth dynas-
ty wild tribesmen the hyksos over-ran egypt
order was not restored until the beginning of the
eighteenth dynasty in  b c the hyksos
were overthrown aahmes became pharaoh at
thebes during this time thamphthis and i made
more and more wonderful discoveries many of
these you will see in our laboratories

  in the eighteenth dynasty i went out into the
world again i held various offices under different
pharaohs when that meddling woman queen
hatshepsut dispossesed thothmes iii i lost
much of my former power her ablest backer
senmut hated me i retaliated by having him
lose the queens favor to keep the truth from
being known i had him slain senmut was a man
of keen intellect so keen that it brushed the edges
of my plans i was forced to dispose of him but
- i still have the real senmut in this place his
body lies in the lower vaults dead but yet alive
i have further use for him

  i gained favor and glory under thothmes iv
and under amenhotep iii of course i changed
my name and appearance so as to escape the at-
traction i would otherwise gain by my longevity

  then came that low desert-wolf would-be de-
stroyer of our gods amenhotep iv he insulted
the great amon even changing his own name to
akhenaton guided by his wily mother he built
his new city in his sixth year as pharaoh none
dared worship any god but aten i remember
well when he drove out from the electrum to pro-
claim aten the blind fools of the heliopolitans
saw their mistake too late

  however akhenatons death marked the end of
his heresies confusion reigned during akhen-
atons reign the armies were used to uphold aten
we were being stripped of our colonies

  weak smenkhara was on the throne nine
months then fourteen-year old tutankhamen
came on the throne five years later i saw the
final rites of his mummy across the nile thirty-
three centuries later as a workman under carter
i saw it brought to light

  at this time one of the important chapters of
my long life was written i had become a general
under tutankhamen i still held my position
the secret of the tomb	

under af our country was in a rapid decline
and it seemed as though the eighteenth dynasty
marked the end of the empire

  to me this did not mean so much when my
plan was complete egypt would be everlasting
there was another young and brilliant general
who acted to avert the calamity his name was
hor-em-heb he became pharaoh and saved
egypt this made him divert his attention from
something he nearly won from me i then had
no rivals to compete with for the hand of the beau-
tiful nefti niece of the beautiful nefertiti

  i won her made her my wife and told her all
my secrets as my plan was constantly being de-
layed i put her into a sleep where she lay as in
death yet retaining all her youth and beauty she
sleeps in the tomb across the moat awaiting my
call

  under rameses the third i met a studious
young priest he impressed me and i took him
into my confidence at luxor he had built an-
other such place as this he is there now in
charge waiting for the word

  i will talk no more of history of the following
periods of how at the end of the empire period
egypts beacons grew fainter and finally died out
suffice it to say that in the roman period i took
the name sais-amen-tanis which still serves me
i will have food sent in and later show you
around good day

  after sais-amen-tanis left our apartment i
sank back in my chair by jove talk about your
arabian nights my heads in a whirl did you
hear the same things i did 

  yes and all was spoken in truth

  what a story think of the knowledge he pos-
sesses he speaks perfect english

  no doubt he speaks many other languages he
has had centuries to learn them

  i say i wonder what his great plan is

  i have no idea

  at this time our food was brought in by a
female slave

  hm said peri evidently other women are
here besides nefti this place is like an under-
ground city

  the meal was sumptuous duck breast of
goose cutlets of beef cakes salads and honey and
fruit the girl brought wine and lit some incense
tapers just as we were finishing our meal sais
appeared behind us without warning peri and i
jumped in our surprise

  wh-where did you come from

  oh my little joke i came in with the girl

  but we didnt see you

  i would have been surprised if you had human
eyes ordinarily do not see electrons and protons
electrons protons

  yes i or rather the electrons and the protons
that compose my body were sent in here on an in-
visible ray over the slaves head behind you in
that cabinet that opened while your back was
turned is where i was assembled

  that is impossible it would be absolutely
contrary to bohrs theory

  bohrs concept of the atom is wrong i see
that you do not keep in touch with the latest de-

velopments in physics in your world your scien-
tists have displaced the bohr theory with that of
schrodinger however schrodinger too is wrong
the wave atom is quite wrong now if one had
the key to the ether do you not think that he could
take down a structure of matter and build it up
again  matter is energy all is energy

  did the early egyptians know the atom i
asked

  no that is one of my latest discoveries i
started on it in  ad

  that is a mighty key you hold said peri

  yes so mighty that you can not grasp it how-
ever i came to show you around come

         a scene of horror	

we passed out of our chamber into the one we
had come in by and then into the room where
the great sarcophagus lay sais walked over to
it and bowing low muttered some strange words
coming back to us he indicated the sarcophagus
and said there is thamphthis i greatest of the
great being wearied of the long years he sleeps
as nefti and senmut soon all will arise

  then as we turned and passed through some
tapestries we saw an amazing scene

  the temple said sais

  we were in a great semi-circular room the air
was heavy with incense and oriental perfume at
the front of the room stood a tremendous golden
figure other figures ranged around the walls
moving among the figures like wisps of smoke
were priestesses out of somewhere came low
weird enchanting music

  sais stepped over to the great figure he made
humble obeisance to it the priestesses had ceased
moving the music continued the temple lights
dimmed

  amon amon oh great one look down on us
who are of thee soon your desecrated temples
will be rebuilt oh mighty amon even now come
defilers of your resting place

   remarked to peri that it was strange that he
spoke in-english

  sais rose and backed away the music rose
and i noticed others filling the temple sais
beckoned us to follow as we passed a statue of
anubis he stopped and spoke in his own tongue
i caught the words anpu and amenti

  then he proceeded to a great chair and we also
were given chairs all the time the music was ris-
ing and a chant was being given by the priestesses
i watched in fascination six priests entered bear-
ing offerings for amon

  suddenly before our startled eyes a section of
the floor before the statue of amon rose up up
up it came then it stopped and we saw attached
below a great cage in the cage were two huge
gorillas the cage was swung off on a platform
and the floor sank back

  the two great beasts tore at the bars of their
cages and the people all around them fell back
then sais arose stepped down and walked over
to them as if by magic the beasts drew to the
center of their cage then suddenly they stood
upright and stiff
	wonder stories quarterly

  with horrified eyes we saw sais step into the
cage the animals did not move then he spoke
and they nodded their heads he spoke again and
they raised their arms and dropped them sais
then stepped out of the cage and came back to his
seat

  he addressed dr peri

  well doctor do you find mesmerism useful
in a few minutes you will see some real testa in
electro-biology

  as he finished speaking a second cage came in
a shout arose a light flashed on it and within
we saw our six men

  the chanting ceased and a high priest rose and
spoke he frequently indicated the two cages
then he turned to amon and sais and everybody
in the temple arose and faced the great figure sais
gave orders and a kit was thrust into the gorillas
cage the two cages were bound together and
then all drew away from the cages all the lights
were turned out except the ones on the cage and
the great figure of amon i looked at this weird
scene feeling as though i was in the midst of a
terrible dream then the voice of sais broke the
silence he spoke it seemed for hours finally
he started to speak in english to us

  before you are six of your men arabs and
egyptian copts present natives of egypt who
for money are ready to destroy old egypts glory
they desecrate egypts gods they care nothing
for egypt the egyptian copts are in a way our
descendants and for their crime they will be
killed quickly for the arabs kin to the hated
hyksos of old for you oh sons of allah is reserv-
ed a wonderful death

  turning to us he continued

  view the fate of your men the way they shall
die is not egyptian but an invention of my own
it has never been used before but it is perfectly
justifiable it is rather unique for it employs the
science of the mind he turned to the great
statue and cried oh amon to you the sacri-
fice

  at his words the music started in a low purely
oriental tone a tenseness was in the air then
suddenly the gorillas started to move i watched
the terror-stricken men feeling sick at heart i
could distinguish them clearly i heard a voice
beside me it was sais

  i am having the egyptian copts killed quick-
ly

  the egyptians in the cage moved up to the side
of the cage next to the gorillas i saw the goril-
las mechanically reach through the bars and
strangle them one by one the arabs were stand-
ing like blocks of stone

  in a daze i watched the two apes take tools
from the kits and cut through the bars going
through movements exactly like men i saw the
two beasts enter the arabs cage saw them take
the men one at a time back to their own cage i
saw that the men came from their hypnotic trance
as they were taken by the gorillas  shall not de-
scribe the horrible nature of their deaths

chapter vii

the great conspiracy

at the end of this ghastly affair the entire tem-
ple was thrown into darkness when the
lights went on again the cages with their horror
were gone

  i never felt more faint in my life and dr peri
looked like a block of white marble we were of-
fered wine and soon lost consciousness for it was
drugged

  this episode the terrible nature of it showed
sais-amen-tanis could transcend all in cruelty
as well as in brain power

  when i came to i found i was back in our cham-
ber remembering dr peri i looked around for
him i saw him seated on a divan absorbed com-
pletely in a scroll i arose unsteadily and went
over to him

  lord peri i cried i never even read of a
more horrible scene than that which we wit-
nessed

he looked up a strange expression on his face

  not nearly as horrible as this paper sais must
have left it here by mistake

  my god what is it

it is the death sentence of the human race

  peri are you losing your mind im afraid
that scene was too much

  nothing is impossible here my boy this
paper contains the great plan it has been great-
ly added to since it was first made that is be-
cause the world is different in all respects from
then it is a plan engineered by the worlds great-
est intellect and the cruelest sit down and hear
a synopsis of its contents

  as sais has said it was started during the end
of the fourth dynasty forty-seven hundred years
ago it seems sais made an amazing discovery
about the time he made his elixir some unknown
mineral was brought to memphis by some egyp-
tian who had gone as far as the congo this min-
eral was given into the charge of saiss father
sais one day discovered a peculiar thing about it
when he placed small objects a certain distance
away from it with light passing through this sub-
stance the objects became much larger

  sais therefore stole some of it for his experi-
nenting soon he so perfected it that single celled
animals became visible of course he did not know
what they were at first however it was not long
until he became aware of the importance of his
discovery he soon learned he had access to a liv-
ing world utterly unknown to others

  he experimented in this world and came across
peculiar things at last however he organized his
knowledge and as a result he knew more about
micro-organisms forty-five hundred years ago
than we do today he made the collossal dis-
covery that certain of these organisms and not
evil spirits cause mans illnesses

  he started to produce some of these organ-
isms deadly to man and to produce new kinds at
length he made the terrible discoveries that
threaten the world today he produced certain
bacilli that superseded all other deadly organ-
isms he took one of these bacilli and from
the secret of the tomb	

it produced an extremely deadly toxin in the form
of a powder which when spread through the air
and inhaled or caught on the eyes was absolutely
fatal

  sais however did not stop there he produced
an anti-toxin for it and put this anti-toxin in his
elixir all those that have the elixir in their
blood need not fear the toxin therefore if this
powder were spread over the world all animal
life above the simple forms would be annihilated
except those with the elixir in their blood

  sais waited long for his plan to materialize
he had no intention of waiting so long but
through the ages difficulties began to interfere
now at last after thousands of years he can make
the world his

  that is his plan he the young pharaoh and
the other priest will rule the world of course
he knows more about the worlds extent and of
his task than he did several thousand years ago

  this horrible plan calls for the destruction of
all the human race except his chosen in this place
and in the other he will also spare a few thou-
sand egyptian copts to serve as a working class
after this part is completed he will go about set-
ting up the old egypt

  do you realize that here in the laboratory
rooms far below us are hundreds of ancient egyp-
tians in the same state as senmut and the girl
and the pharaoh these people have still hun-
dreds of years before them some day egypt will
cover the entire world and no nation will dispute
her

  you know my son im afraid you cant appre-
ciate the extent of saiss knowledge he far sur-
passes our scientists in every field once his
forces are set in motion no power can stop them
do you know what power was exercised over our
men and the gorillas do you know what science
sais is master of a science our world knows little
about mesmerism electro-biology

  sais is going to use it in-

  hello gentlemen i sincerely hope you feel
well

  it was sais coming out of no-where how long
he had been listening i could not tell

  hello i stammered

  well gentlemen i just happened to overhear
but dont worry it is just as well i was going
to tell you sooner or later now we can go ahead
now you understand my purpose it is only fair
i show you around and explain come

  we followed him to the room of the sarcopha-
gus here he stopped us and clapped his hands
a slave appeared bearing a scroll sais unrolled
it and showed us a continuous series of drawings

  here are plans plans of everything here above
and below the ground

  for five minutes we examined the plans we
learned there were six levels to this central build-
ing we were on the sixth the two main exper-
imental laboratories were on this level besides
these on this level were saiss rooms one of which
we occupied and other luxurious living rooms the
room where the pharaoh lay the temple and
quarters for saiss attendants

  gentlemen sais began you have no doubt
noticed the external features while you were be-
ing brought here the fifth floor is on a level with
the moat this one above it the first floor below
there are three elevators one you saw in the tem-
ple one in my main apartment and the other in
the main laboratory this shaft in the laboratory
not only extends to the main level but goes up to
the surface through the pyramid

  so you see my friends i usually leave by the
pyramid the mastaba is used but rarely the
chief laboratories are on this floor i think you
will find them most interesting so we will go there
last come to my chamber and we will descend
to the fifth level this level is modeled after the
court of rameses ii this level is the most beau-
tiful and as its on the moat level it has the advan-
tage of having its own terrace

the realm of sais

we descended to the most resplendent apart-
ments i had ever seen sais conducted us
through them they covered the entire level and
were beyond description these rooms had been
used bythe pharaoh thamphthis before he de-
cided to rest a few years

  well go down to the fourth level now it is
there we keep our materialistic treasures sais
said after we had looked over the fifth level

  we descended into a circular room which had
halls leading off like spokes from a hub we
passed down one of these halls everywhere were
egyptian guards armed with swords and a deadly
ray generator from sais we learned that the
guards sent a code number at a designated time
as a report to the control room we entered one
of the mighty vaults the first thing to strike
my eye was a peculiar machine in the center it
resembled the projector in a planetarium it had
disks like a projector has facing in all directions

  ah said sais you like what your scientists
call television that is my device a picture of
everything in this vault is obtained in the control
room the control room sees all every vault is
equipped the same if anybody is found in them
that shouldnt be the air supply is simply shut
off for a time

  i looked at peri and he looked at me we knew
sais meant what he said we then looked at the
coffers they were carved from diorite

this said our guide is the gem room

  he motioned us to one of the coffers it was
about four feet high of the same width and about
six feet long i looked at the top and gasped
across the top were incised thirty figures figures
of men standing upright arms outstretched head
back the egyptian sign for million

  thirty million i gasped

  look within said sais he pressed a button
and the cover rose we were blinded by flashing
gems diamonds

  they are all diamonds i asked

  yes in the other coffers are rubies emeralds
sapphires and pearls all of equal value

  we were shown the contents of the other cof-
fers which were slightly larger when we left the
coffer i said
	wonder stories quarterly

  i should value this coffer at about thirty mil-
lion pounds

  that is but a part of our wealth come

  we went through vaults stored with platinum
gold and silver i asked sais the total value
for an answer he took us into a chamber where
two scribes were writing he took a gold bound
scroll and showed us the value of the treasure
before us we saw a man with outstretched arms
and to the right and slightly above a small frog

  sais smiled and told us he used the figures alge-
braically

  impossible i cried one hundred thousand
millions you are mistaken besides where did
you collect this treasure

  based on the present value of these things
that is what they are worth of course i could
not sell them for that they would have no mar-
ket i did not collect i formed or manufactured
i told you i know the laws of the atom and i know
the ether it is simple then to produce them for
amusement now to the third level

  on the third level were laboratories and work-
rooms finely equipped and producing new won-
derful things they however were secondary
their work was given to them by the chief labor-
atories

  we then passed to the second level parts of it
were horrible freaks produced by the bio-chem-
ists animals for the experiments monstrosities
like the gorillas created by sais in one section
were hundreds of captive birds and bats

  then we passed to the lower level this we
found to be twice as large in extent as any of the
others one half was a series of store rooms
here were supplies of all sorts then sais led us
down a long hall to the other section we were
told by sais that this would be an interesting part

  we entered a room of mammoth proportions
lit in violet i felt a peculiar nervous sensation
before us stretched long rows of tables construct-
ed of marble on each table lay a glass case dr
peri and i correctly surmised their contents in
each lay an egyptian sleeping till the time was
ready with the elixir in their blood and by other
inventions of sais they had been sleeping for cen-
turies a drug like that in nefti and thamphthis
produced the sleep this drug produced a kind of
coma where all the bodily functions cease the
elixir enables the extreme prolongation of the
coma

  we saw the noble senmut who engineered hat-
shepsuts dier-el bahri it was like going back
into old egypt walking among hundreds of that
old race

  finally we came back to saiss apartment where
he had wine brought if i had been bewildered
before i was ten times more so now sais talked
and for the first time asked us questions about
ourselves he did not ask much however then
suddenly he asked what do you think of our in-
telligence compared to your civilization

  it transcends our civilization i replied as
much as that of your country surpassed other na-
tions thirty-five centuries ago except for one
thing

  and what is that may i ask

  that is your outlook on numan life it is of
a low ignorant barbaric type true our civiliza-
tion settles disputes by war true we have mur-
derers and other unfeeling people but our general
view-point far exceeds yours in your hunt for
knowledge and facts you missed the greatest fact
the thoughts of a mans mind determine him
sais laughed and exclaimed

  why you are a philosopher well think along
your entrenched ideas mine will become this
earths law now you shall retire to your cham-
ber and rest then i will conduct you to the chief
laboratories

  we returned to our chamber and prepared to
sleep we did not know the time for i had for-
gotten to wind my watch and peri did not have
his of course the inhabitants of this place cared
nothing for time also of course we could not
tell night from day it was because of these facts
that a most startling thing happened to us

  peri and i both went to sleep i awoke first
and then woke peri a little later sais came in
how long we slept i do not know sais bade us
bathe and then had food brought in finally he
arose and said

  we will go to the chief laboratories and then
my proposition

  we followed him back to his apartment and
then through a panel door we found ourselves
in a long oblong room along the walls were
cases of chemical apparatus different machines
were distributed about the machines were high-
ly complicated and though electrical little resem-
bled any apparatus i knew of some did look
like x-ray machines stony-faced men stood
around at operating boards others were among
the glass topped tables some tables looked like
operating tables one man was talking before a
small coil of wire on a loop that was connected
to a peculiar apparatus some liquids in it were
being mixed in a horizontal tube a conductor ran
parallel to it about an inch away sparks were
jumping across the gap

  sais told us the man was talking to the control
room i saw two of the men apparently study-
ing the effect of some rays on a screen sais told
us that physical and chemical experiments were
going on here he took us to one end to show us
the power unit this was stupendous in its work-
ing no person attended it machines were cal-
culating equations the whole thing was run ac-
cording to absolute laws the laws of the atom
sais who knew these laws had machines to control
them the electrons and the protons follow cer-
tain laws any one knowing these laws can figure
ahead and get the ultimate equations these ulti-
mate equations give the energy of matter itself
these machines worked the equations and con-
trolled the power

chapter viii

a flattering offer

finally we left and sais took us to theother
laboratory where the control room and the
shaft to the pyramid were located it was about
the same as the other in size and entirely of whit-
the secret of the tomb	

ish marble the shaft to the pyramid was in one
corner and a car was inside the car went up by
an ethereal wave pressure at the other end was
the control room in between was the biological
section

  we saw a human body lying on a table i re-
cognized it it was ahmet the top of his skull
had been removed sais toyed with a trephine
and talked about the experiment

  you see i am continuing my brain efficiency
experiments i used this mans brain for a cer-
tain substance i wanted a sort of juice in the
brain there is a substance upon which depends its
efficient functioning and nerve activity i took
some from this mans brain and injected it into
the lymphatic glands of two of my slaves i had
worked with dogs and apes but you must have the
human substance to inject into a human

  further on we saw some men operating on bats
ah continued sais here you should be in-
terested  these bats are old friends of yours
how i asked

  well one night they kept your camels com-
pany

  kept our camels company

  oh yes these bats killed your camels let
me explain you shall see how much i depend on
mesmerism yes mesmerism is my all handy tool
the field of science it opens is amazing but by
using my present knowledge i get necessary im-
mediate results you see i have control of all the
lower animals here by the mind by performing
an operation on the brain the subject is rendered
more susceptible

  i will be egotistic and say i have the power
over mind far exceeding any other so all i had
to do was get some of my bats i choose bats of
the vampire class with prominent piercing parts
those parts were covered by a deadly poison
then i sent the bats out under my control and
did away with your camels and incidentally
frightened the guard to death too simple too
simple come here

  we followed him there in glass cases exclud-
ing short length ether waves were tubes of that
deadly toxin sais spoke

  look my friends gaze upon what soon will be
spread over the earth

  how shall you spread it i asked mechanical-
ly for his words brought me back to his terrible
plan

  oh how simple mesmerism my friend i and
my assistants will control thousands of birds who
shall have the toxin powder dusted on them the
birds will have the anti-toxin in their blood so
they will not be affected then the great scien-
tists can try to protect the world ha yes they can
try the people here and at the other place have
the anti-toxin in their blood we need not fear
my god

  ha yes thousands of birds will soon be scat-
tering the toxin quite freely then after all are
dead we will raise egypt again to power and
glory come here

  we passed to another part of the laboratory
here we saw a dog or what had once been a dog

sais had been experimenting again at changing
the actual bodily form of animals

  see here my friends what would your zoolo-
gists call this i have told you before about
changing bodily form i made cats as large as
calves and vice versa my gorillas are one of my
larger products yes the secret of the proto-
plasm opens many doors come and look at the
controls the heart of our abode

  we followed him into a glass partitioned room
i shall not describe it but quote saiss explana-
tions

  yes the heart ten of my most intelligent
scientists are always on duty here to handle all
the television five men are needed my television
scheme is far superior to anything known to your
scientists here we receive pictures of strategic
points control number one ought to interest you
from it comes pictures of the outside world by
means of it we watched your expedition i saw
the last expedition leave by it after i had five of
them smitten no  gives us pictures of the mas-
taba on the ground and the first two chambers
underground and the corridor no  watches the
terrace and the moat no  watches the treasure
vaults and no  watches the fifth and sixth
levels so we see rather well

  here are the controls that operate all doors
and panels outside of this structure they also take
care of the water movement these operate all
doors in the building here is an important set
the main power controls with the mathematical
machines they guard the infinite power this is
the receiving and broadcasting system here the
orders are sent and these here ah this is where
the ray controls are those rays that disintegrate
and rebuild matter

  now friends you have seen all here is your
part and the terms i have kept you alive and
will continue to do so as well as allow you a life
of luxury if you wish power and time for re-
search you will have it if you will consent to the
terms given you i have need of your services in
carrying out my plan come with me to my cham-
ber

  when we had entered it i stood before him and
in low even tones began to talk

  sais do you think that we will ever consider
aiding you in destroying the world and our peo-
ple

  but you will live in a much better civilization
you will have opportunities that you could never
receive in your country i want you to aid in the
distributing of the toxins human aid is neces-
sary and you are of your world are well known
and could do what i want you to

  one of you i will place under hypnotic influ-
ence and the other i will not i will send you
back to your countries with valuable no invalu-
able archaeological objects things that will create
more interest than tutankhamens tombs

  these will be sent to all big cities for inspec-
tion and with them shall be some toxin you two
men went out on an expedition so you can say yoti
discovered these if investigators come you can
tell them you found the relics at this place if
they investigate here i will have a tomb prepared
	wonder stories quarterly

 for them with enough relics in it to satisfy them
 i have written and cabled your friends and gov-
 ernment officials so they will not wonder why you
 do not send word

 if any body comes here too soon i shall hypno-
 tise you and give you some men and let you out
 to work to yourselves you will seem normal and
 going on with your archaeological work as for
 that boy of yours who wasnt trapped well he
 was captured and brought here yesterday

 you monster do you think we will consent
 you still have time to think over your final
 answer whether you accept or not will not save
 your world it would simply help me and save
 yourselves i still have work to do and i command
 you to go to your chamber

 peri and i after we were back in our chamber
 became nearly frantic soon all the people of the
 earth except a few would be exterminated our
 beautiful world was to be wiped out

 a slave brought in some wine and we both fin-
 ally took some after a short while i felt drowsy
 and my head began to swim dr peri fell back
 on a couch in a dead sleep suddenly all went
 black and i fell away

the escape

 a tugging of my side an incessant tugging
 and a throb throb in my head i wanted to
 sleep how i wanted to sleep tug tug tug
 master oh master

 i twisted slowly my head in a sickly swirl
 master oh master

 then my conscious mind returned i struggled
 to sit up and open my eyes the tugging ceased
 i opened my eyes before me a face i had seen
 l fore and then my full consciousness returned

  ali i cried

 oh master you are awake at last

 ali where am i what has happened
 then a terrible thought flashed across my mind
 are the people in the world all dead

 no master not yet

 thank god but where is peri

 over there master

 i looked and saw him lying in a case looking
 around further i saw where we were we were
 in the lowest level in the room of the death sleep
 where hundreds of egyptians were

 peri i cried

 softly master he is but in saiss sleep

 that wine last night i said must have been
 drugged but how did how did you get here ali
 the wine you drank seventeen months ago was
 drugged my master not last night

 seventeen months ago

 yes my master you and peri have lain here
 for seventeen months

 my god

 follow me master i have found a way for
 your escape and i will explain dr peri will be
 all right

 i followed in a daze we went into the store
 chambers and there i heard faithful alis story

 as sais had told us he had been captured
 sais fortunately for ali had use for him it
 seems something happened to sais laboratory

servant the elixir in his blood was not the same
as that in the others and the toxin had killed him
he was mummified and his mummy case was
made sais had him put in the burial chamber
of the northwest mastaba

  however two french egyptologists found it
and this was the mummy we had seen and com-
mented on at the louvre

  ali took his place sais had yet to finish con-
structing his bogus tomb and he wanted us out
of the way for a time so our wine was drugged
then while we slept he introduced a small amount
of the elixir and the other more powerful sleep-
ing drug and we had been taken down here

  ali had found this out but he never could go
down then sais did something that indirectly
aided ali he awakened nefti as he felt he soon
would be ready to sweep the world then i learn-
ed nefti never had favored sais brutal plans
she heard of us and wanted to see us but sais for-
bade her

  however she managed to steal down now
here comes an embarrassing part ali claims she
fell immediately in love with me and took pity
on me rot of course but at any rate she came
down several times

  learning ali was our servant she questioned
him about us ali was by this time learning an-
cient egyptian and he saw immediately that
through her he might aid us sais told ali of his
plans about us and ali told nefti

  she therefore determined to free us ali j ump-
ing at this chance gave her suggestions
he knew from the first that it would be best to
free only one of us he told nefti she would have
to get some of the neutralizing fluid before sais
himself awakened us this she finally did

  then with her aid and a slave who obeyed her
ali was projected down to me by the ray this
was possible because in the store rooms were re-
ceiving cabinets

  i embraced ali warmly and thanked him

  he told me that sais wouldnt come down for
six weeks and i must escape right away he said
we would take the shaft up to sais chamber
where nefti was waiting quietly we sped up to
the sixth level

  i stepped out and then involuntarily gasped
before me stood the most beautiful creature i
had ever seen or ever hoped to see dressed in
the most gorgeous raiment stood nefti she her-
self i shall not try to describe words are inade-
quate she overpowered my sense like some sweet
but potent drug she glided over to me and said
three words in english

  how are you

  i stammered like a school boy and said

  er uh fine that is extraordinarily fine er uh

  ali whispered to me that she understood very
little english excepting that which he had taught
her she laughed lightly ali saved me by seating
us and playing interpreter that our conversa-
tion was meager mattered little i immediately
became infatuated with her

  it all seems so peculiar now i think of it sit-
ting in that place talking to a princess of ancient
egypt her eyes continually sought mine ali
said however i had better eat and hide for the
the secret of the tomb	

night i was to hide in one pf the slave quarters
going i lifted her hand to my lips and kissed her
fingers

  all night long i thought of her i say night
but it may have been day outside when i awoke
ali brought me food saying i was to leave im-
mediately nefti he said was up in the pyramid
when i finished he had made the shaft car ready
for luckily no one was around i asked if peri
would be all right and ali assured me he would
he was going to stay till i came back with tears
in my eyes i bade him farewell the car shot up
to the pyramid

  i stepped out and stood before nefti i fol-
lowed her down a passage way we came to a
great wall on which nefti pressed a stone and two
panels on it slid open we stepped into the open-
ing and the panels closed inside nefti pressed
another small stone and we moved a bluish
violet light lit up the interior

  suddenly the motion stopped and the panels
slid open i gazed over the desert and at the
egyptian sky we stepped out and i saw near us a
fine horse she handed me a paper which i found
out later ali wrote for her in english

  in the light of the desert moon i read the mes-
sage on it were the words written by her direc-
tion

 oh modern man take this horse which is
equipped and escape the horse is a product of
sais it knows no fatigue rescue your friends
and when you destroy this place as i know you
will always remember nefti

  tears came to my eyes as i finished i looked
at her god but she was beautiful then i step-
ped towards her took her in my arms and kissed
her she sobbed and clung to me i made her
understand i was coming for her and then i
mounted my horse i see her yet standing in the
light of the egyptian moon standing before the
structure reared by her peoples

  i traveled with all haste to england here i am
and you donald are the first to hear my story

  what do you intend to do

chapter ix

back to the tomb

this was the remarkable story i heard from
alfreds lips the dawns first light was
creeping the room when he finished his eyes
were staring in front of him and his face was
white i had sat like a statue all through his
story now i arose stiffly

  lord i said i doubt if any man ever met
so much adventure but lets have a whiskey and
soda

  you talk of whiskeys and sodas after what i
have told

  oh come i realize the full import just give
me time to tnink after all you know you cant
run right back to egypt

  yes but my god every delay brings us nearer
to the fatal time think also of the fate of nefti
peri and ali if sais discovers i have escaped he
will immediately set his plan in operation that
is why i came to you if i told the authorities

they would go blundering around before they
would believe me and sais would start at once
thats just it secrecy and then a surprise at-
tack i know dr taylor and through him we will
get in touch with the heads of scotland yard i
will call him at once

  after a light breakfast we were speeding in
stewarts car towards london at eleven thirty
we pulled up at scotland yard headquarters ex-
actly twelve hours since i was first ushered into
this mad thing dr taylor was waiting for us and
we were quickly shown in to the superintendent
there before the superintendent dr taylor
lord beachley and myself stewart retold his
story more briefly i saw looks of astonishment
on the faces of three men but not one bit of dis-
belief was registered

  the superintendent sat and toyed with his pen
arose and paced about the room lord beachley
and dr taylor sat and looked at me stewart be-
came impatient my lord say something what
plans have you 

  the superintendent wheeled dropped his pen
and spoke

  heres what well do well get in touch with
the foreign office immediately well state the
facts to sir arthur kent and then after commun-
icating with the egyptian government set out for
egypt somehow or other well get dr peri and
the others out of there and then well come to
terms with sais

  well never come to terms with him well
have to capture him forcibly but how i asked
the superintendent continued speaking

  i will have an air-force situated in the desert
nearby you stewart will have to get back in and
learn the location of the other place nefti knows
most likely get nefti peri and ali out of the
place then see sais and try to get him out if
you cant do it escape yourself if sais tries to
carry out his plan we will immediately bomb the
place by tomorrow ill have you on your way
back to egypt

  the next day saw the completion of our com-
munications with the foreign office that evening
i was with taylor and stewart on a boat-train
my mind was in a whirl the chances were all
against our succeeding little did the world know
of its impending fate

  i could easily see by the way we were received
at the various stops of our journey by secret gov-
ernment officials that word of our mission had
gone ahead of us

  at alexandria we were hustled on board a
large transport airship we flew along to the
west of the nile and as we neared cairo we cut
straight west across the desert the pilot kept
at a very high altitude finally we changed to
a more southerly direction and stewart told the
pilot to drop lower

  far below i could make out black blotches on
the desert sands stewart said

  thats the place but dont go any lower well
land five miles to the southwest the plane kept
on to the southwest and just at sunset we landed
stewart taylor and i got out of the plane what
we were to do had been all pre-arranged stewart
and i were to go on to the pyramid taylor was to
	wonder stories quarterly

stay with the pilot stewart and i started off
through the night across the desert

  when we first came in sight of the pyramid
stewart told me to drop to my knees when we
had approached a little closer he told me to crawl
he said we must escape the watchful eyes of no 

  i could tell well enough that stewart must have
been in a state of great suspense and apprehen-
sion if the suspense was hard for me to bear
it must have been doubly hard for stewart at
last we reached the base of the pyramid i could
see the silhouettes of the mastabas outlined
against the sky i had no time before to specu-
late on my surrounding but now the full eerieness
of it dawned on me i shuddered involuntarily

donald give me your light nefti has shown
me a stone a secret stone that will open the wall
ah here it is god if no  spots us were gone
i wished i were two thousand miles away and
told stewart so

  he did not reply suddenly noiselessly the
front of one of the big base stones slid apart
panel fashion the ends sliding over the other
stones inside i saw a small cabin stewart and
i went in and sat down on small seats

  stewart pulled a lever closing the panels he
pulled another and we started to move when
we came to a stop the panels opened and we
stepped out into pitch darkness i stood still
while stewart cautiously snapped on his light
after looking around he put out his light and
came over to me

  its nearly nine oclock time is nothing to
those below but ali who has a watch goes to
the control room at  p m every night tonight
when i give the signal ali will let us down

  but how about the ten men in the control
room

  its then that shifts are made only one man
will be in the control room for several minutes
ali will drive a knife through his spinal column
one hour more

  we waited it seemed for a year until stewart
pulled out his watch

  ali should be there in three minutes i will
give the signal then if somebody else gets it
were done for

run master run

in three minutes stewart gave the signal we
waited then an answer in stewarts code i
followed stewart to the elevator shaft the area
about the shaft was lighted i saw the car a
globular thing rising without support it rose to
the floor level stopped a door swung open and
we stepped in the car descended

  it stopped and stewart went to the side door
he opened it and stepped out i heard him talk-
ing quickly then he told me to get out

 come quick ali has the body of raamen
when the others come he will say raamen has
gone and he is to take his place until he returns
nefti will meet us in the temple come

  i hastened out looked at ali looked at the won-
derful laboratory and followed stewart we
passed into an orientally furnished room then in-
to a large nearly circular one the room where

thamphthis the first lay stewart grabbed my
arm and we passed into the temple

  something rustled beside us we turned and
there stood the most beautiful woman i had ever
seen she looked like a blending of the finest
oriental and occidental womanhood stewart
took her to him and kissed her she clung to him
murmuring then she saw me and started

  stewart laughed and indicated that i was harm-
less i bowed to her and she smiled then she
motioned us over to a great statue at its base
she pressed a button and a door flew open we
were to hide there till peri was free we stepped
in and the door closed after us

  two hours later our hiding place was opened
with nefti was an oldish man with a ghastly ex-
pression on his face

  peri my old peri good she got you

  stewart and peri embraced each other there
were tears in peris eyes nefti gave us all food
and put us all back in our hiding place after
waiting until we were all cramped i was aroused
by hearing people walking around in the temple
peri and stewart too sat up and listened then a
voice spoke out in a strange tongue

  i could not see either peri or stewart but from
their hoarse whispers i knew that they were high-
ly keyed up stewart whispered to me

  its sais

  the voice ceased and we heard the sound of
footsteps leaving the room peri and stewart
seemed shaken because of hearing the terrible
sais i myself never had contact with him but i
felt chilled

  we heard a step outside of our hiding place
we sat up the panel opened and ali quickly
stepped in his voice trembled

  oh master he cried sais is terribly angry
because raamen is gone he does not know he
is dead and he is looking for him he sent me
from the control room and ordered one of the
scientists to take raamens place he sent nefti
to her chamber and is going to search every level
for raamen what if he goes below and finds
you gone

  we must get out of here ali will you try
to bring nefti here

  yes master but i have a plan two men here
are greatly devoted to nefti they also have work-
ed in the control room i will send them saying
sais sent them to the control room they can go
while sais is below control operator no  and
the shaft operator will be recalled then you
can all escape

  yes stewart began but we want to upset
sais terrible plans and how will you escape

  master i will take care of all do as i say i
will be all right say goodby to me for the pre-
sent

  stewart embraced ali and with many a break
in his voice said

  ali there never was a more faithful loving
and brave lad you will join us at the shaft
goodby for the present ali

  peri embraced ali and i shook his hand and
then ali went out

  poor ali if stewart had known that that good-
by was to be the last he never would have let him
the secret of the tomb	

go ali faithful to the last had bidden his mas-
ter his final adieu

a few minutes later we heard someone ap-
proach and the panel opened there stood nefti

come she said ali fix

we followed her out of the temple through the
room of the sarcophagus through a chamber and
into the laboratory we passed unnoticed to the
pyramid shaft and got in the car the only one
who saw us was the one at the controls of the
shaft the car sped up the shaft and we got out
of the car

we waited in the pyranid and then from a re-
ceiver near the shaft we heard alis voice

run master run get out of the pyramid
and run into the desert i will follow you run

we ran to the secret wall car and soon we were
out in the open fortunately we continued to run
away suddenly there came a deafening roar
the earth shook and we were pitched down it
seemed as though the world blew up

when we arose stewart turned and exclaimed

my god look

we turned horror-stricken and saw that the
pyramid and the mastabas were no longer there

the

instead there was a great crater stewart stepped
shakily forward and then cried

  ali ali my ali

  one hour later on board the transport and ac-
companied by a score of other planes we were on
our way to cairo

  sir arthur had arrived with the bombing patrol
and had come to us after the explosion in the
main cabin we told our tale of how ali wrecked
the energy of matter control and destroyed all
nefti said this is what ali must have done prob-
ably because sais had found out that stewart
and peri were gone and was about to wreak his
vengeance that final scene is known only to
god

  we told our tales again in cairo and london
the other headquarters of sais were located with
the aid of nefti and destroyed thus was brought
to a dramatic end the worlds greatest peril
stewart peri myself and above all nefti were
honored throughout the world

  three months later stewart married nefti and
went to america peri went back to france and
became honorary director of the louvre i my-
self am able now to take life easy and am content
to rest peacefully in england

of the ch osen

    by thomas h knight

as i stood by the open grave of old captain
jeremiah taylor i thought well theres
one case of a mans fears failing to mater-
ialize theres one man who didnt die the way
he thought and feared he would

  the gravel rattled down on the box envelop-
ing all that remained of the hardy old sea-dog
and i wondered if the old fellow inside were
thinking it was a drummer from one of the
many dark corners of the earth he had spied
into tapping out some tribal message on his

weird tom-tom dimly i heard the monotonous
murmur of the minister sing-songing the last of
the simple service then my imagination went
out and away over those seas of captain tay-
lors looking into the unchartered ports and
lands the old chap had often yarned about

  by his own words he had been an adventurer
his roving desire to look into things taking him
into many a tight place i could see his wink

s

those eyes
and the
calculat-
ing stare

me at

first but
i knew
what i
must do
those who have traveled into the remote corners of our globe return with stories that appear
to the untraveled to be pure fiction they speak of tribes customs animals plants and civili-
zations that seem to us impossible of existence in our more or less matter of fact age

    yet as our author shows there are more things to misquote shakespeare than are dreamed
of in science fiction this story is so realistic it might have occurred in actuality the chosen
are quite possible of existence and so is their messengeras to the dread power of hypnosis
that they exercise there is much dispute we occidentals laugh off as day dreamsr the talk of
strange powers over the mind possessed by many sects but read this story and be convinced that
what our author relates might have happened to any of us

again hear hia lowered voice as he told of deeds
that must be kept secret deeds doubly thrilling
to the boy at his feet

this is a quiet old home jimmie he had
once said pulling on his queer long pipe

 nothin happens here in this peaceful com-
 munity we get to thinkin the whole worlds
 civilized and all clean above deck but it
 aint i know some things ive been into some
 of the dark holes of the earth ive seen witch-
 ery and magic and-worse

   its hard to believe here among the flowers


wonder stories quarterly

and my old colored people gentle and mild as
they are with their ardent and singin praise to
your god and my god jimmie he went on
that there are human devils loose in the world
who can pray their victims to death you with
your parties and your tennis and your makin
eyes across the pews instead of listenin you
may want to laugh when i tell you that all they
need-those hellish prayin priests-is a lock
of hair or such to mumble their prayers over
then first thing you know the owner of the
hair wilts and withers and then he goes away

  the old man nervously thrust his pipe back
between his teeth and quickly changed the sub-
ject telling me of some sacred jewel that had
taken his fancy and that he in turn had taken
from the neck of an idol i was only a boy when
he told me it thrilled me to hear him relate
how he had to lie all night in the gruesome tem-
ple waiting for the dawn and the opening of
the doors that he might escape but boy though
i was i could tell the old fellow was more than
just excited there was fear behind his words

  then as my increasing years suggested other
reasons for my visits to the quiet
old southern home besides its hos-
pitality the captain came to re-
gard me less as a boy and more
one to whom he could talk as an
equal the captain and i stood
one evening on the lawn beneath
bright stars i would rather have
been in the house from which
came the alluring tinkle of the
voices of the captains two lovely
daughters i was wasting my
time out there with that nervous
old sea rogue but he held on to
me something was preying on
his mind

  jimmie he said this things
gettin me

  what thing i asked i
dont know enough about it one
way or another but youre foolish
to worry like this man alive captain taylor
could anything be more peaceful than this old
home tonight come on sir i would rather
go in and dance with the ladies than-

  youre frank you landlubber if nothin
else he laughed mirthlessly but you dont
understand my boy jimmie im scared they
dont forget i tell you they never quit i
wish i could put it back he shivered and
though the night was warm i shivered with
him what was he talking about who were
they who never quit then he went on
ytake a calm peaceful night like this just
when yought to be thinkin youre safe or else

not givin a thought to it and then-then-

i tell you that kind never quits yes come on
lets go in

  that had been a month or so ago he had
not told his family these things but they had
known he had been afraid of something that
lately he seldom stayed alone and that dark-
ness held a terror for him

  so rambled my brain as the dirt fell into the

grave some one plucked at my sleeve then and
i came out of my reveries to realize that the
burial was over my thoughts however as i
helped the mourning family into their car were
still upon the needless fear to which the old man
had surrendered himself

  he spoiled his last days i thought with
his apprehensions all this while he had been
afraid of some horrid violent death and instead
of it happening that way he had died peacefully
in his bed theres nothing in that evil-eye or
witchcraft stuff he hinted at anyway all bosh
given a sick train heat and bad gin and out of
the tropics comes some derelict white with a
tale of a demon priest for the world to swallow
the dirt was hardly smooth above the cap-
tains body before we were again gathered
around that grave yet this second death did
not alarm us nor did it cause us to believe there
was foul play my sweethearts mother had long
been ailing and it seemed to us who knew her
sweetness that she was merely carrying out her
faithfulness when she quickly followed the sailor
into the one port he had never before made

there was nothing strange about
her peaceful passing

  but when news came in a few
more days that george the only
son had died everybody even
those who knew nothing of the
captains fears murmured
three in a row theres some-
thing wrong there

i

thomas h knight

mysterious marks

was away from our little town
when i heard of george but i
tied my throttle open and gave
my car her head the captains
fear was now upon me i thought
of tracking merciless priests as i
rushed across the country and i
knew i should hear desperate tid-
ings when i arrived

  i quickly found out that george had as i was
sure he had been murdered killed in broad
daylight suddenly under the very eyes almost
of the two sisters and the large number of ser-
vants about the home yet not a trace of the
assassin had been seen the local police were
stamping all over everything and each other
accusing the servants of being guilty or at least
knowing who on the inside had done it in my
rightful interest and new fear for the girls i
hastily assumed as much charge of affairs as
the police would allow and either by sheer luck
or perhaps because i was not quite so stupid as
they i stumbled upon the only clue as yet un-
covered

  what are those two marks like punctures
beneath georges chin i asked pointing to-
ward the body of the chap with whom i had
played football

  what marks aw thems nothin birth
marks probbly the local detective replied

bess i asked gently of the girl i loved now
more than even did george-that is-had you
the revenge of the chosen	 

noticed marks like that on your brother lately
no and jimmie-mother had them too
what does that mean

  that jest proves it broke in the local sher-
lock holmes didnt i tell yer birth marks
like mother like son-

  shut up i interfered hotly bess do you
mean you saw marks like these on your
mother

  yes both ethel and i noticed them but we
thought it was part-of-of-you know-the
undertaker

  the autopsy when finally made showed that
george had died from a virulent unknown poi-
son and i knew in my heart that had they
looked beneath the whiskers around the cap-
tains throat also more of those strange punc-
tures would have been found i knew then that
the thing the captain had been fearing was a
real thing a cruel murdering thing that had
struck its deaths hand into the family three
times

  uncle ebb i said to the faithful old colored
major domo of the house tell me all about it
nuthin to tell mr jimmie only dat some
debbils loose in de ouse mr gawge had done

i was fairly sane but-if he didnt go out
through the door into the house with all the folks
there swearing he didnt then he must have come
this way but by blazes he didnt

i heard him scream i grabbed a wrench and
waited i knew it was bad he wasnt the kind

der but he didnt come no sir i swear it
i told the police of my sinister fears but they
laughed at me i started to tell them some of
the hints the captain had dropped about vood-
ooism and witchcraft but they asked me what
blood and thunder had i been reading then
they left us promising to take it up again in
the morning

  in the morning left us for the night in that
rambling old house with a year of darkness upon
us i feared the hastening night now as the
captain had feared them three deaths one af-

ter the other two sweet girls alone remaining of
the marked family one of them my own adored
sweetheart and  alone to stand between them
and-and-what what was it that lurked
and pounced and killed so quickly that killed
in the open beneath many eyes and yet could
not be seen my staggering brain wondered

   the shaking uncle ebb and some of his hench-
men stood guard at the door of their mistress
room while i heavily armed watched their
window from the lawn it was a superbly clear
night the moon a ball of silver no creeper
could have climbed to their window without my
having seen him or tearing him to pieces with
the charge from my gun but nothing happened
and at last dawn came

a challenge

two days and night of fear and unrest
passed then the postman innocent med-
ium brought us a letter containing a warning
just a few words they were on a small square of
brown linen the threat lettered in ink place
the green heart on the sundial tonight else
thou too shalt die-the chosen of aracas
was all it said but it threw the girls into a panic
of fear

  we hunted the house through for anything
that might have looked like a sacred green
heart but we found nothing though the home
was full of trinkets and souvenirs from the dark
sink-holes of the earth but for all our fear i
managed to find in the note a cause to buoy up
my sinking courage a bit

   its going to be another clear night i said
to the girls every bit as hopefully as i felt
well fix up a package for the sundial and
when he comes to get it-well the chosen son
of whoever it isll send no more warnings ebb
and mike and ill fix him

   ebb stood again that night at the door of the
room which sheltered the girls we three would
protect to the last ditch while mike and i sta-
tioned ourselves at two different windows the
lawn lay beneath us like a stage in a spotlight
the sundial and the package stood out staring-
ly mike had a pump gun loaded with big shot
and i held a heavy rifle if he came he would
not stand a chance i knew i could not miss
him and i knew my heavy bullet would about
cut him in two but would he come

   as the night went along i began to doubt it
hed be a fool if he did but so full of fear was
i becoming for my dear one that if he did come
i would draw a line on him make sure i had him
right and then i would tear loose at him

  one or two light fleecy clouds crossed the
moon but the resulting lacy shadows on the
lawn were no cover for a creeper i stood wider
awake held my rifle in faster readiness wished
he would risk it and make a rush for it but he
did not

  and yet-and yet-in a little while i knew
something had happened i hardly knew what
it was at first my brain refusing to believe that
the sundial had been visited but it couldnt be
denied for long the top of the sundial was dif-
ferent the box had gone
	wonder stories quarterly

  had i been watching the lawn alone that
night i should have been forced to believe i had
dozed for a moment or two but there was mike
too he had not slept even if i had next day
his face was white and drawn and he refused to
be left alone he could understand no more
than we could a thief who came and went with-
out being seen while anxious watchers closely
watched

  three days passed three long-drawn days of
fear and wonder then we had another note
on the square of linen again demanding the
green heart-a last warning and becairse
we had been unable despite our desperate ef-
forts to unearth the thing we felt we were in-
deed in our last trench weary from loss of
sleep and the horror of the intangible hanging
death i was at my wits end frayed and worn
and ready to try anything

  tonight i told them as shadows began to
fall and the horror of another year of darkness
encompassed us tonight must finish things up
heres my plan i admit its desperate but weve
got to do something well put out another
package and ebb and mike and ill watch you
girls will go to bed or pretend to fully
dressed and ill watch from your room your
window will be open when he finds for the
second time that the package is a fake maybe
hell-i hope he comes to your window if he
does ill be there ready what do you say
can you trust me

   they assured me they did to the limit well
do anything they said to get it finished so
just as an extra precaution in case i should nod
i stretched a fine thread across the open in-
viting window anyone creeping through would
break the thread and drop an attached weight
into a metal pan but i should not need the
alarm for not even the devil himself could
catch me napping that night no by jupiter
not with the kind of visitor i would be expect-
ing i only hoped for one chance at him all
i wanted was the murdering dog across my
sights for a short moment

   at last the lights were all out the house in
apparent peaceful sleep the bait on the sundial
and i sitting in a deep shadow beside the bed
in which the two girls lay huddled together
what trust they must have in me i thought
as minutes and hours and time itself hung still
and what a fool i was i muttered when af-
ter a seemingly long while a wary glance at the
mocking lighted face of my watch told me how
little of the night had actually passed could
we stand it how long before the girls would
be in hysterics and i myself shouting to ebb to
flood on the lights

   the moon was full again not even a puff of a
cloud in the sky i could see the sundial plain-
ly could see that the box was still there the
clock in a distant steeple flung its passage of
creeping hours across that silver-white night
while i knew completely what an imbecile pro-
tector i had been to the girls vainly trying to
stifle their sobs beside me and while they
sobbed i waited waited for some human devil
or some uncanny weird ghostlike wisp of a

thing to come creeping in to administer its death
through two little blue holes beneath the jaw
only a hard-dying pride made me hold to my
purpose

a long vigil

time had completely forgotten to move some-
where in between the chimes of the early
morning when suddenly my heart jerked hard
into my ribs what was it i had heard noth-
ing real yet there pounded my heart-thump
thump thump i felt it coming whatever it was
the girls gave no sign of having heard but i
knew it was coming up over the porch roof be-
neath the window

   it was too bright a night really for a creeper
to have crept past mikes eyes if not my own
but he must have done it for my rackety heart
knew he was near then i steadied my finger
slipped in on the trigger of the automatic rifle
the fierce clenching with which my nervous-
ness had gripped the stock left me i was cool
now if he would only come the full distance

  my eyes burned from my straining staring
and i blinked and held them closed to wipe
away the dryness when i saw things clearly
again i saw there was a shadow on the window-
sill i reaised my weapon he should have it
at my first sight of him then i knew that the
shadow was not a shadow or else had changed
from a shadow into a smoky-colored rat a huge
rat god what a size it was

  it was ironical it was mockery a moment
before i had been keyed up and expectant be-
lieving the shadow to be the forerunner of a
beastly murderer and that my time-and his-
was at hand while instead it had turned out to
be merely a huge overgrown filthy rat but i
was much relieved now that the strain was
over i was glad i had nothing but such a harm-
less thing to contend with i leaned quietly for-
ward to shoo the animal away

  but suddenly i stopped that thing on the
sill turned its head it drew more of its body
on the sill then i saw it was not a monstrous
rat but a- groped to name it-an in-
dian mongoose fear took me again

   the eyes of the creature rested on the precious
occupants of the bed and there the cruel gaze
remained something about those eyes and
that calculating stare numbed me at first but
then like a flash came the knowledge that here
was-here was-the murderer perhaps af-
ter all hammered my keen or crazy brain it
was not even a mongoose but i knew what i
must do i was on the point of pressing the
trigger when light as a snow-flake it dropped
into the room half way across to the bed it
stopped its steady sneaking way to gaze again
at the girls and that fearful beast twice as
large as a mongoose i was sure now with its
long pointed horrible nose-and its eyes-
and its tail as large and as flat as a beavers
made my blood chill within me i looked into
its eyes looked through them it seemed into the
brain beneath and in my well-nigh delirious
foolishness believed the brain behind those
eyes to be human
the revenge of the chosen	

  it was gently slithering up the bed-post before
i came to myself then i loosed my hot metal
my first shot tore it from its hold my second
hurled it across the floor and the third blasted
it shattered into a corner of the room

  no need to dwell upon the pandemonium that
ensued lights flashed on and ebb and i car-
ried the younger girl and helped bess into the
library and there we huddled until daylight in
the morning we carried that horrid thing to a
nationally-known naturalist who lived out of
town a mile or two and the decision handed
down by professor hardy made of me not just
a slayer of vermin but something of a hero

  this is a menagause explained the old gen-
tleman excitedly very rare very rare in-
deed weve heard of these beasts but i doubt
if another living naturalist has even seen one i
am indeed fortunate you undoubtedly have
cleared up the mystery see here are his poi-
son sacs nothing more virulent than this kills
in a moment and here see are his fangs
two these caused the punctures beneath the
jaw that-

  no thanks professor i interrupted thats
all i care to see take my advice handle him
with steel-lined gloves good-bye ive had all
i want with the thing i left him then glad i
had been able so unexpectedly to supply the
naturalist with such a rare specimen but i was
far from being satisfied at first flush of ex-
citement it had seemed as though i had rounded
up the murderer but now upon second thoughts
it was certain that the beast well-trained as he
may have been had not been writing notes
no the creature i had killed had only been
the medium of death the instrument of the
real poisoner the question then was did the
killer this chosen of aracas have another
such instrument of vengeance

  then there was that other thing that persisted
in bothering me that ghastly thing that i kept

to myself-those eyes and the brain i believed

i had seen behind them it was a horrible
thought and foolish but i could not throw it off

  days passed slow days while we guarded the
girls and took every precaution and waited for
his next move i was far from being myself not
only were my nerves tearing apart but the loss
of sleep was using me up when i did fall into
a chair i slept at once i dozed leaning against
the doors or while talking but it was never a
real sleep more like a harrowing anaesthetic or
drug slumber-never refreshing me my dreams
were a continual mixture of the wonderful love
with which i loved bess and which i dreamed
she reciprocated and a nightmare of the beast
i had killed that creeping menagause had left
its indelible impression on my brain and there it
ate into me

  at first they were just nightmares through
which the beast crawled back and forth but
after a while it harassed me clawed me
scrambled all over me and reached for under my
jaw i became even afraid to go through the
house alone for fear of meeting it i knew then
i was losing my mind

a clue at last

when i grew thin and the stare from my
eyes frightened them they called a doctor
he was doctor enough to know that i was sick
that i would collapse if something were not done
but what it was that ate at me was where his
diagnosis had to stop sometimes especially af-
ter a severe spell i would be particularly clear-
minded and then i would see something that at
another time would have given me a thrill of
satisfaction bess was not just mothering me
worrying with me fearfully alarmed for me
merely because she was a loyal little soldier
sticking to a pal but because she was growing

to- but i thrust this lovely thought from

me a madman was not the sort to think of love
and such a superb girl as bess

  they kept the news from me when another
piece of linen came but in one of my clear
spells seeing the new fear in the lovely eyes of
bess and demanding to know the reason they
showed it me i took it in my hands but so
quickly was my brain likely to change in those
days that even before i had read the lettering it
carried i was in a dreamy vaporish way back
in france again up in the clouds high in the
blue of it far above the battle below with a
metal-pouring german on my tail i dived in
that crazy dream of mine swung on my joy-
stick came back at him with my sights on his
fuselage and turned loose my death through the
blade he went down with a rush and i-com-
ing from my dream with a jerk-read the note

  you have killed my emissary it read but
there will soon be another emissary i
laughed he calls that stinking thing that
crawling brute with the fangs that just fit under
your jaw an emis- they led me away sor-
row in their eyes

  no wonder it had all been so uncanny no
wonder the murderer had been able to creep and
kill and take our box from the dial from under
our gaze the more i thought about the horrid
mess the morel became convinced that the real
brute we fought had somehow changed a human
into an animal a crouching animal that had
struck and hidden behind a chest or up in the
drapes of georges room a flitting thing that
had been a shadow as it came to the dial for the
box

  i was alone in my room with these thoughts
and as i brooded over them more and more i
came to know that the chosen brute of aracas
had indeed spoken truth when he said there
would soon be another for it came into my room
another menagause it crossed the floor it
clambered at my bed or if it did not my tor-
tured brain completely crazy believed it did

  it came across the covers to me took me by
the throat i reached lazily to brush it away
but instead finding it soft and warm and nice to
touch i stroked it it was not nearly so odious
after all my dazed brain thought in fact it
was so nice that i should not greatly mind if i
too were a menagause slowly i stepped from
the bed half fighting it yet eager to do it i
went down on my hands and knees sniffing
	wonder stories quarterly

creeping on the back of my hands on my arms
i believed i saw the hair growing and coarsen-
ing and changing to a crinkly fur i was chang-
ing into a beast being transformed into a
menagause

  ebb found me there snapping and snarling
and it was the last straw to him he yelled and
slumped down along the door-frame bess came
but it was too much for her also however my
plight acted differently upon her than it had
upon the dark man she may have been as
frightened but something suddenly beat at her
heart that had not pounded at ebbs and it
was her sudden outpouring of other than moth-
ering love that saved me it must have been
loathsome for her to kiss my furry cheek and
lips i still managed to think as they lifted me
but she did it a soothing coolness fanned
me i slept then a real sleep the first it seemed
for years and i awoke next morning nearly nor-
mal the love of bess had overpowered the ter-
rible thing that had been gnawing at me

  i had ebb bring me again that last note we
had received and as before the moment i had
it in my hands i was back at the stick of a ship
with the glint of sun on wing and rudder and
singing wire the roar of engine and blade in my
ears but this time my brain was my own i
lifted that square of linen to my nostrils and
knew on the instant why i had unconsciously or
subconsciously that other time thought again
of my flying days in france i smelt dope
dope that sheliac-like composition with which
airplane wings are coated

  i grabbed the astonished darky by the front
of his coat ebb i fairly shouted is there an
airplane factory around here

  airplane factory good lawd boss nos-
sir nossir whut would we be doin vid a-
ebb have you ever seen a plane

  tessir

 where

  dey fly ovuh real offen-sometimes

  did one ever land here or smash or anyone
ever build one is there one in town

  yessir yessir dar is nowlmember young
mr brown broke his fool neck in one down on
market street its still dar i reckin in dat ole

shed of grimeses or leastways it wuz-

  ebb get the car around for me dont
leave the ladies out of your sight for a moment
tell mike what im doing if anything happens
to the ladies while im gone ill murder you
both

the trap

i went through town like mad and by the time
the police had decided to wonder what some
of it was all about i was peeking into the old
shed of grimes snd looking on the wreckage of
an old army training plane man i was eager
and excited on the trail at lastp the brute
who had been using the airplane linen for his
notes and who had no way of knowing that a lit-
le dope would give him away lived here-
abouts i would find him and finding him
would kill him in this great desire of mine to

tear into the cause of all our recent miseries i
had forgotten he was above the average killer

  that part of town had always been taboo to
me as a boy and i was therefore not any too
well acquainted but when i saw a dark-skinned
man in the long flowing robes of an east in-
dian priest standing in the doorway of a squalid
house i knew he was my man his eyes dragged
me on i went right at him without a word
merely the clash of our eyes flinging their hot
challenges he turned and entered the house i
followed i did realize a bit then that i might be
putting my head into a nest of hornets but i held
something in my hand in which i had implicit
faith and all i wanted was to get him within de-
cent range what did i care as  followed him
in that he had once before deadened my brain
and almost made of me a thing that crept and
sniffed across the floor the gun i held in front
of me had no brain to be dazed knew no dif-
ference between a voodooist and an ordinary be-
ing

  my first glance into that dim interior showed
me that i was in a pet shop where monkeys and
parrots in their cages gibbered away an excuse 
for this brute to be in a peaceful town pursuing
his real evil trade on the counter in its cage
was an indian mongoose it gave me a jerky
scare but next moment i had forgotten it as i
approached a heavy curtain that divided the
room and as i came closer to the completion of
the work in hand

  i pushed through that curtain as cautiously as
i possibly could eyes keenly before me but 
was not keen enough the curtain came down
from the ceiling like a heavy stifling cloud to
envelop me in its folds as completely as though
i were beneath a load of sand hands snatched
at me many hands it seemed to carefully taka
me from the tangle and weight of it to bind me
securely hands behind back and to fling me in
a heap against the wall then i knew they had
me i had walked into his trap the curtain had
sprung it and found like a trussed fowl i found
time to realize what a hot-headed idiot i had
been

  i looked around my pistol was on a table
while four black-skinned and blacker-hearted
brutes stood over me at a sign from their
leader the three myrmidons went into a rear
room leaving the priest squatting on the floor
before me when he spoke he used good english
and i had no trouble in understanding either his
words or his meaning

  dog and twice dog hear me he began
thou who wouldst interfere with the plans of
the chosen of aracas as a man thy days are
finished thy brain hath almost ceased its own
functioning henceforth thou shalt heed my
commands i had thee in my power once before
knew thou wert almost mine then-what i am
at a loss to know-something interfered for
the first time my skill was thwarted now
nothing shall interfere thou art mine thou
shalt go forth from here with thy mans cunning
and brain in an animal body to wipe away the
last of that accursed family
the revenge of the chosen	

  my brain whirled i had known it but as he
said it it was worse than i had fully realized
i to go out from here at his bidding to crawl
through the night to hunt the girl i adored and
who loved me to-to- i could not think of it
it was too horrible too devilish he looked me
straight in the eye and i heard the first of his
fiendish incantation i shut my eyes but could
not keep them so i opened them drawn to the
magnets of his to feel the old terror and close-
ness and liking for the menagause creeping
over me

  they have no green heart i shouted in
that last flicker or two of my own brains reas-
oning weve hunted for it wed give it to
you if we had it come to the house take-
take-anything-you want but let me go

  but he was past hearing me his eyes were
shut now his mumbling and praying-praying
me into a furry creature-roaring and crashing
in my ears i had been through all this once
before so knew by the sensation that enveloped
me that he was succeeding in his praying i
knew in a few moments i should be seeing the
beast come sneaking in then i should grow to
like it would reach out for it would see the hair
on my hands and arms before me change to fur
and-

  bess i cried bess help me you saved
me before save me now i love you bess i
whispered like a child then fell back exhausted
i was nearly gone and how could bess help me
how could she save me when she could not even
hear me

  i felt that beast come crawling to my wrists
behind me as i knew it would felt my bonds
strangely enough but part of the whole diaboli-
cal proceeding of course slacken i brought my
arms around into my lap still not knowing i
was free then perhaps i realized a bit for the
first time that instead of the menagause at my
bonds it was the mongoose in the scuffle the
cage must have flung to the floor where it had
either broken or the door swung open to release
the animal

  not that i stopped to wonder at these things
for at that moment the priest before me opened
his eyes they bulged when he saw i was no
longer tied really telling me for the first time
that i was actually free he clapped his hands
at once his three servitors rushed back into the
room then life and thought and the desire to
live came to be in a flash and i leaped to my
feet and jumped for the pistol on the table like a
snake striking we all reached for it but by a
hair i got it then with the thing at their
breasts i backed them into a corner i felt bet-
ter it was good to draw so suddenly such an
ace from the deck with a wave of the hand the
priest gave them an order in their native tongue
then they came at me with their naked knives

the end of a priest

otand back i ordered tell em to stand

  o	back you heathen devil or ill tear em in
two but he ignored me merely urging them
onto me they crept closer until just feet separ-
ated us in a moment they would spring and i

would fire the odds were all in my favor now
and they deserved anything they had coming to
them but why it was that i wished i had not to
turn death loose on them is more than i can ex-
plain i wanted to get the priest but i felt it a
bit of a shame to have to slaughter the others

  stay back not another step ill kill you if
you- then i did it one sprang at me and i
had to the bullet met him in midair and not
literally but actually hurled him back it was
a large weapon i wielded-a brute of a killer

i	knew the man was as good as dead the moment
he hit the floor so evidently did he for he
reached into his robes and produced a green
shining object which he held up to the priest by
its golden chain like a hawk that chosen one
hovering near snatched it his whole body
radiated joy success venom

  thou dog he snarled through his pleasure
it is the green heart how happens it that
thou hast it

  the sahib taylor-placed it-after-first
warning i-i would place it around the throat
of aracas with-with-mine own hands i had
a box-empty-the one i gave you as being the
sahibs-

  dog deceiver swine hissed the priest
he kicked the man full in the face hurrying him
along the road to eternity

  and that kick restored to me a little sense
flung around me a wild killing rage everything
about that kick and them was horrible jere-
miah taylor had delivered the jewel at the first
warning i knew then but because of the fana-
tical desire of the man i had shot to return the
beastly jewel to the sacred throat with his own
hands three innocent lives had been taken two
girls had been to the brink of insanity through
fear while i had been closer than at knifes edge
to being prayed into an animal that crawled and
sniffed and punctured

  the priest gave another order to hold me at
bay i suppose then quick as a flash passed out
the rear door the two men sprang at me i
met the first with a bullet just as i had his filthy
pal but the other pinned me to the wall his
hand to my throat while his knife arm flashed
back for tho stroke i pressed my pistol into
his side and let it go then stepped across his
body to follow the priest

  the back of those houses overhung the river
the rear porches built on stilts like huge spider
legs over the deep drop the priest was scaling
the railing of a porch some thirty feet away a
simple vengeful shot i brought my sights down
onto his back the pistol spat its hate the devil
was reaching for a hold above him as my shot
rang out twice his fingers clutched for a hold
twice they missed then he wavered hung a bit
clutched again missed completely i leaned out
over my rail to watch his whirling flight to the
river below feeling as he plunged that this world
was suddenly cleaner and that the gates of hell
were clanking open for him as he went over
and over i saw a green thing hanging by its
golden chain from his tightly clenched hand go
whirling as he whirled

  back through the house i staggered to find
the front pavement bobbing and tossing and
plunging as the priest had plunged then it
came up spitefully at me hit me-and i was in a
machine with someones loving arms closely
holding me when next i knew what was going
on i was weak but it was a gentle soothing

the

 weakness and my mind was free my heart full

 are you all right asked the splendid girl
 in whose love  was smothering

 just as well as you hope i am bess darling

 i	replied the priest is gone the jewel is gone
 your troubles are over everything but our love
 end

between earth and moon

          continued from page 

  in the hall of the allister house the same hall
in which a month ago the friends of the rocket
had been seized with despair a small group of
notables was assembled

  about the house surged the happy shouting
mob

  hurrah for allister

  hurrah for apel and egon helmstatter

  and then there was a still louder shout hur-
rah for the united states of america and hurrah
for germany

  mr all right one hundred thousand dollars
for the first report

  mr barret the owner of the new york evening
ledger was holding out a check to the invalid
another pushed him aside

  the new york bulletin offers a quarter of a
million

  barret scribbled fast you are employed by
me and i too will give a quarter of a million
others crowded about korus but he declined
their offers

  only germany gets my first report

  barret climbed up on a table one moment
gentlemen permit me a word it is self-evident
that the entire world and america first has a
claim on the five travellers of space it will be a
triumphal journey like no other before i will
conduct it if you pledge yourselves for a half
year i will take you all over the world and pay
you any sum you want

  now egon jumped on another table he had
hardly spoken since leaving the rocket

  i thank you in the general rejoicing for us
what else could we five say but i thank you

what mr korus and mr all right want to do is
their own concern they are journalists and
stand in the public eye but i and my fatherly
friend waldemar apel are going to fly to atkin-
son peak to-day fate has been kind enough to
let us return home now it is our duty to work
out scientifically what mankind can benefit
from as the result of our trip i thank you but
at present we have no time to give to celebra-
tions

  the president of the united states pressed
egons hand you are in truth a real hero

  egon smiled perhaps i am only a thorough
german

  the ambassador of his native land pressed him
to his heart let us rather say a true german

  on the flat roof of the allister house an air-
plane was waiting it was a large plane which
america presented to egon to welcome his re-
turn

  apel was already sitting in it likewise joe
allister who was of course accompanying the
two with his daughter

  then a strange gentleman came up the steps
it was an elderly gentleman in a black suit

  allister smiled as he now said the reverend
mr thompson will accompany us

  irene allister blushed and clung to her father
while the latter pressed egons right hand

  i think we shall have to celebrate a little
wedding at atkinson peak

  while the airplane was rising upward the
loudspeakers all over the earth were announcing
the return of the first persons who had succeeded
in reaching the moon and the fortunate arrival
of the space rocket

 america who could write on so delicate a subjcct

 heretofore educational ex book have been writ-

 written for young people

   while writing these books dr keller wrote a
 long letter to the publishers part of which fol-

   my idea is to write in simple language
 in a conversational or lecture style or to
 use the language of my wife just as you
 talk uj usf my wife is a college graduate
 and taught eight years in the high schools of
 the south one daughter is preparing to
 study medicine and the other is just about
 to graduate from ojtr local high school and
  consider their advice and opinion as a very
 good index of the average mentality of our
 expected readers my ultimate aim is to make
 the zvorld a little better place to ihe in by
 educating ihe masses along the lines which
 have previously been inaccessible to them in
 tvrtiing i am going to keep in mind that
 we want to help folks to be-
 come happier

 most of the misery and suffering in human
 life can be directly attributed to stx misinforma-
 tion dr keller in these books offeis a solution
 for thi evil as well as for other and perhaps
 greater evils the author knows bis subject as
 few other physicians in the country know it and
 s a well-known author he is able to write in
 such a way that there is nothing offensive evn
 for the most unsophisticated of young girls

 parents have not as yet arrived at the state

 where they can be perfectly frank in matters of
 sex with their children hut henceforth dr kel-
 ler valuable books can be safely entrusted to
 all intelligent young people the older genera-
 tion themselves will find much of value in the
 series

   there is little question but that these books
 will become famous will blaze a new trail they
 will be read and reread for more thorough com-
 prehension of the subject matter involved the
 sexual educational semes gives you facts and
 knowledge contained in the highest type of liter-
 ature with the exception that it is written down
 to the understanding of the every-day man and
 woman girl and boy the excellent anatomical
 drawings which are profusely distributed through
 these books are so mechanically treated that they
 will never arouse the sensibilities of even the
 greatest prude yet they are an education in them-
 selves dr keller has torn the veil of mystery
 from sex matters and presented to the american
 public the true facts of sexual life he has de-
 bunked sex

   these book are printed in brand new type the
 subject matter has never been published before
 a number of volume are profusely illustrated
 with fine anatomical drawings the size of each

four stories rated

editor wonder stories quarterly

  i am a fourteen-ycar-old boy and
  am a very enthusiastic reader of your
  magazines i have read your won-
  der stories quarterly ever since it
  has been published of the main
  stories in your first four issues i
  rank as follows

  moon conquerors

  the stone from the moon

  elcctropolis

     the shot into infinity

   your artist paul is wonderful
 his illustrations are vivid and origin-
 al

   are any of the german scientific
 films going to be shown in america 

              lister carison

  cherry st aberdeen wash

   we have received letters from
 readers in which practically all of the
 feature stories in the first four is-
 sues of the quarterly received the
 highest rating we would like to get
 some more comments from our read-
 ers here we have four giant stories
 which is the best according to your
 opinion 

   we have information that an inter-
 planetary film the girl from the
 moon filmed by the ufa company
 of germany is to come to america
 soon the picture has been practical-
 ly completed and it is even expected
 that sound or talking sequences will
 be a part of this great experiment in
 motion pictures we will inform our
 readers just as soon as we have exact
 information about the date at vhich
 the picture will be exhibited-editor

          on utopias

 editor wonder stories quarterly

   after reading lilith lorraines
 into the th century i have come
 to the conclusion that there can never
 be an utopia incidently the author
 mentions in a certain part that the in-
 habitants of the future world spoke
 of a stomach ache aa if it were a
 matter of international concern
 would this not prove that of the
 easier living conditions existed the
 people would correspondingly soften
 if a person of the middle ages when
 sanitary conditions were null and
 void when religious freedom was
 unknown when war and blood shed
 were every day occurrences were to
 be placed in a modern civilization
 would he not consider it an utopia
 it is only when the soul of man is
 able to realize his blessings that
 there will be an utopia

               charles rush jr

              grand concourse
             new york

   mr rush puts a very interesting
 question to us there is a lot to be
 said for his point of view-that if life
 is made too easy for us we will soften
 and degenerate and go the way of
 babylon egypt rome and many
 other great civilizations

    it is really necessary for each civil-
 ization to provide its own antidote
 for the evils that might be a part of
 the pleasant state of life that miss
 lorraine pictured in her into the
 th century miss lorraine herself
 had pointed out some of the possibili-
 ties athletics sports exercise of the

 jody are ail considered in her utopia
 to be a part of the life of the people
 thus the people keep physically ac-
 tive their minds remain alert they
 feel in another form the enlivening
 spirit of competition

   some of the militarists say that
 war is a necessary part of our lives
 for without the awakening of the war-
 like spirit every so often man will
 degenerate others agree with the
 militarists but say that in strenuous
 competitive sports man can work off
 the energy that he would use in war
 what do our readers think-editor

  from a youthful savant

 editor wonder stories quarterly

   just received my first copy of
 wonder stories quarterly and ill
 say it was fine r h romans war
 of planets although good didnt
 make it that way neither did elec-
 tropolis

   henrik dahl juves monsters of
 neptune pulled the issue up above
 the mark there was nothing wrong
 with it except that question of grav-
 ity neptune may weigh less volume
 by volume than earth but there is
 plenty of it on neptune i think the
 gravity would be very great

   juves story had humor and so did
 moon rays by keller md the
 best humorous story in your wonder
 magazines was flannelcakes inven-
 tion in air wonder speaking of
 humor why dont you bother edward
 elmer smith phd for a good one 

   a while back you asked opinions on
 time traveling i dont think its pos-
 sible if it could be done it would
 only be into the future im only 
 year old so you neednt take the fol-
 lowing seriously

   the three attributes of infinity
 are time space and motion space
 has three dimensions so have time
 and motion matter is but a fold or
 bump between space and motion
 with time as a constant the first
 three dimensions are contained in
 space the fourth fifth and sixth in
 time the seventh eighth and ninth in
 motion one of the dimensions of mo-
 tion reaches into all dimensions below
 it and so there is motion in time di-
 mensions and space dimensions one
 of times dimensions reaches into
 space so matter while it may have
 motion in space has motion in one
 of the dimensions of time also to
 travel in time jump over into an-
 other dimension and bounce back

   thats one of the twisters in my
 brainstorm i havent finished think-
 ing it out yet  but thats the main
 structure of it i wrote a story about
 it but copied too many other authors
 now im on a start story of about
  words and assuming a future of
 so many years instead of sending the
 hero through time

   concerning atomic energy i be-
 lieve it possible not by breaking down
 atoms and getting the energy of the
 rushing electrons but by letting ele-
 ments combine producing rays as
 molecules produce heat when combin-
 ing and thus expanding as com-
 pound-molecular gas does under heat
 atoms when combining would prob-
 ably produce x-rays of terrific force

   some authors say nothing can go
 faster than light how about elec-
 trons in a coolidge tube going well
 over  miles per second

  like nikola tesla i dont believe
light or any other ray travels in
waves through the ether i believe
that rays are waves of motion es-
caping from matter

  concerning gravity gravity is an
electro-magnetic wave which in empty
space would vibrate in all directions
but in the presence of a body of mat-
ter has some vibrations interfered
with two bodies interfere with part
of these vibrations and as the bal-
ance of energy is disturbed the bodies
are pushed together theoretically
gravity can bo artificially interfered
with probably it most certainly will
be done my new story deals with a
force giving effects like gravity but
not quite the same im not ready for
gravity stories yet a fictitious force
i can prescribe rules for but an ac-
tual well known force not for a while
will i tamper with on paper

            harold gibson

            granger ind

  we have an almost complete pic-
ture of his conception of our universe
presented to us in young mr gibeons
letter we are proud to have our
youthful readers such serious thinkers
on the problems of the cosmos

  speaking on the possibility of re-
leasing atomic energy dr milliken
stated that it will come about not by
breaking down the atom but by con-
structing atoms from others in this
mr gibson agrees-that the energy
in the atom possible to use is not the
energy of the rushing electrons but a
difference of inherent energy released
when an atom of one element is
changed into another element thus
in his rescue from jupiter mr
gawain edwards had his inventors
break down hydrogen and build up
nitrogen atoms

  mr gibson is wrong in stating that
the electrons from a coolidge tubo
travel at  miles per second
the figure we believe is 
miles per second-editor

  i am writing this letter to express
my thanks to you for awarding me
the second prize in the second quar-
terly contest you may be sure i
appreciate tho honor a great deal  

  the check has enabled me to start
work upon my plans for next years
science fiction week i am
quite sure that you will co-operate
with me again and i hope that other
science fiction magazines will do so
also  

  you may be sure that i shall not
leave off my work toward improving
science fiction because i won the
prize on the contrary i am being
spurred on toward even greater ef-

continue his good work in behalf on

stantly talking this new literature to

verted and so like a snowball the

  ive heard of candy fiends and many
other types but i am a new kind
im a wonder stories quarterly
fiend and how can i help it with
that wonderful silver illustration on
the front drawn by paul you cant
blame me

  it seems to me that every issue of
our quarterly gets better if such
a thing is possible as they are all per-
fect

  i am glad to see that dr hellers
story the moon rays is in this
quartbily as it was supposed to be
in the last one but was evidently
crowded out

  the eternal man was one of the
best short stories i ever read and i
am delighted to see that you have
secured a sequel to it

  henrik dahl juve always writes
good stories and the monsters of
neptune promises to be one of his
best

  all of the other stories including
the sequel to the moon conquerors
and electropolis are thrillingly il-
lustrated and i am sure will be very
exciting

  i	want to thank you for taking my
suggestion of printing a list of mo-
tion pictures with scientific back-
grounds and would like to start off
your list with the following two
high treason a story of life love
and war in the future and jules
vernes the mysterious island

  and now as usual i would like to
ask you a question or rather two of
them

  first how fast would it be nec-

of motion pictures of science fiction
metropolis a story of tbe future
which was exhibited several years
ago and the girl from the moon
the showing of which is promised to
america soon by ufa of germany
we would appreciate additions to this

  regarding mr ackermans ques-
tions-if a man were to travel west-
ward along the equator at  miles
an hour approximately he would
always sec the sun in the same posi-
tion if he started when the sun
were overhead it would be perpetual
noon for him

  radium would probably destroy
ones bodily tissues and even the
bones the use of radium in cancer
is based on the ability of radium to
eat out the cancer cell when
swallowed of course the radium
would eat up everything physically
at least the radium would break down
the tissue into its basic elements
the time it would take would depend
on the amount swallowed death
might occur before any appreciable
amount of the tissue had been de-

two home runs

editor wonder stories quarterly

  the w s q has made another home
run it has produced a masterpiece
in every issue otto willi gail is the
babe ruth on the gernaback team
his two famous home runs a shot
in infinity and the stone from the
moon will never be forgotten in the
science fiction world and i hope our
young american authors will read and
learn how to write real stories they
seem to have a good imagination but
they dont seem to be able to nail
it down to scientific facts

  for example take henrik dahl
juves the monsters of neptune a
very good story but its not nailed
on scientific facts in his story he
overlooked the fact that the gravity
is so much greater than ours that
our explorers would be almost glued
to the ground and wouldnt be able to
move

  the moon conquerors by r h
romans is a very difficult story to
judge the start or first part of the
story was perfect but my interest
dropped when he started to give some
ancient history but still it was bet-
ter than the average stories i hope
he will give us a sequel to the war
of the planets

some good reading

        thinkill change my job

ou know this man as well aa you know yourself his
mind nibbles at everything and masters nothing
at home in the evening he tunes in the radio-gets tired of
it-then glances through a magazine-cant get interested
finally unable to concentrate on anything he either goes
to the movies or falls asleep in his chair

    at the office he always takes up the easiest thing first
puts it down when it gets hard and starts something else
jumps from one thing to another au the time i

   there are thousands of these people with grass-
hopper minds in the world in fact they are the very people
who do tv worlds most tiresome tasks-and get but a
pittance for their work

   they do the worlds clerical work and routine
drudgery day after day week after week month after month
year after year-endlessly-they hang on to the jobs
that are smallest-salaried longest-koured least interesting and
poorest-futured

    if you have a grasshopper mind you know that this is
true and you know why it is true even the blazing
sun cant burn a hole in a little piece of tissue paper unless
its rays are focussed and concentrated on one spot

   a brain that balks at sticking to one thing for
more than a few minutes surely cannot be depended
upon to get you anywhere uyrour years of life

   the tragedy of it all is this you know that right
now you are merely jumping here and there yet you
also know that you have within you the intelligence the
earnestness and the ability that can take you right to the high
place you want to reach in life

   what is wrong whats holding you back

    just one fact-one scientific fact that is all and when
yon know what it is then you can easily learn how to apply it
make it carry you steadily positively anit directly
to prosperity and independence

    that fact is one which has been proven and stated by the
worlds foremost scientists and psychologists you are only one-
tenth as successful as you could be i why because as
science says you are using only one-tenth of your real
brain-poweri

   ten per cent of hi brain is all the average person
uses he is paid for one-tenth of what he really possesses
because that isll he actually usfcs the remainder lies dormant
the longer it is unused the harder it becomes to use it for the
mind is like a musda it grows injower through exercise and use
it weakens and deteriorates with idleness

    what can you do about it that is the question you are
asking yourself here is a suggestion

    spena c for a postage stamp send in the coupon below for
a copy of scientific mind training there is no further obliga-
tion whatever you need not spend another penny

    this little book will tel you the secret of self-confidence of a
strong will of a powerful memory of unflagging concentration
it tells you how to acquire directive powers how to train your
imagination the greatest force in the world how to make quick
accurate decisions how to reason logically-in short how to make

your brain an instrument of dl aro-nd power it tells 
how to banish the negative qualities like forgetfulness brain f j
inertia indecision self-consciousress lack of ideas mind
dering lack of system procrastination timidity 

    men like judge ben b lindsey sir harry lauder pr
charles of sweden jerome k jerome the famous novelist 
p walsh chairman of the national war labor board and h
dreds of others equally famous praise the simple method
increasing brain power and thought power described in this fq
book over  others praise it

something to their advantage-will act on their impulse i
