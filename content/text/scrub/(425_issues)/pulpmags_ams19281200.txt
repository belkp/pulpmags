 you too gan quickly be
 come a coyne trained

              it is hard for mo to understand soma
  xukltr emall-pay-job holders they spend
  their moat useful years hopelessly expecting  raises

  dull occupations-without a chance for praise or
  reward-no heart la their work-little in life to loot
  forward to the first step up from that rut is so easy
  that every ambitious fellow grabs it quick any man
  from  to  years old can quickly find a bplendld
  place for himself-with absolutely no limit to hia
  prospects -in electricity coyne has
  trained thousands of them for big-pay-jobs and every flay the
  demand for new fellows grows heavier inthis giant industry
  no experience or advanced education neededl
  i take every new coyne student lust as he comes to me many
  thought they were handicapped by lack of experience-age or
  advanced education i convinced them these things made no
  difference dont let anything stop you-not even lack of money
  most coy negraduates had no more-probably less thanyouhave

fascinating work-real pay

  there can be no doubt about the wonderful big-pay successor
  coyne men after graduation for instance lets take a few at
  random-theres dunn of texas-started at a salary twice as
  great as any he had ever before received ward of colorado
  says coyne training was the best investment i ever made
  money couldnt buy it from me now tushka of wisconsin
  struck out for himself at once makes as high as s a day in
  his own electrical business shaw came to coyne direct from a
  farm in canada-went back to hia native country and has
  averaged between s and  a week ever since these are
  not unusual cases-i can point out hundreds of bigger coyne
  graduate successes

big pay jobs hunt coyne men

  the opportunities in electricity for coyne trained fellows have
  always been easily located but the chances for distinction and
  worth while success were never so good as they are today this
  giant industry can only grow as fast as new electrical experts
  are trained and appointed to service i estimate that  new
  fellows could be put to work at splendid salaries during the next
   months-if they could be f ound but how can i hope to meet
  even a small part of that demand for trained electrical experts
  unless you and many other ambitious fellows like you take
  advantage of this situation and let me train you quick i am
  surely trying to do my part-and i would like to help you too

amazing stories



if all the radio sets ive fooled
with in my time were piled on top
of each other theyd reach about
halfway to mars the trouble with
me was that i thought i knew so
much about radio that i really
didnt know the first thing i
thought radio was a plaything-
that was all i could see in it for me

  i thought radio was a plaything

but now my eyes are opened and
im making over  a week

   a week man alive just one year ago
a salary that big would have been the height
of my ambition

  twelve months ago i was scrimping along
on starvation wages just barely making
both ends meet it was the same old story-
a little job a salary just as small as the job
while i myself had been dragging along
in the rut so long i couldnt see over the
sides

  if youd told me a year ago that in twelve
time i would be making  and
more every week in the radio business-
whew i know id have thought you were
crazy but thats the sort of money im pull-
ing down right now-and in the future i
expect even more why only today-

  but im getting ahead of my story i was
hard up a year ago because i was kidding
myself thats all-not because i had to be
i could have been holding then the same
sort of job im holding now if id only been
wise to myself if youve fooled around with
radio but never thought of it as a serious
business maybe youre in just the same boat
i was if so youll want to read how my
eyes were opened for me

  when broadcasting first became the rage
several years ago i first began my dabbling
with the new art of radio i was nuts
about the subject like many thousands of
other fellows all over the country and no
wonder theres a fascination-something
that grabs hold of a fellow-about twirling
a little knob and suddenly listening to a
voice speaking a thousand miles away
twirling it a little more and listening to the
mysterious dots and dashes of steamers far
at sea even today i get a thrill from this
strange force in those days many times i
stayed up almost the whole night trying for
dx many times i missed supper because
i couldnt be dragged away from the latest
circuit i was trying out

  i never seemed to get very far with it
though i used to read the radio magazines
and occasionally a radio book but i never
understood the subject very clearly and lots
of things i didnt see through at all

  so up to a year ago i was just a dabbler
-i thought radio was a plaything i never
realized what an enormous fast-growing in-
dustry radio had come to be-employing
thousands and thousands of trained men

please say

i usually stayed home in the evenings after
work because i didnt make enough money
to go out very much and generally during
the evening id tinker a little with radio-
a set of my own or some friends i even
made a little spare change this way which
helped a lot but i didnt know enough to
go very far with such work

  and as for the idea that a splendid radio
job might be mine if i made a little effort
to prepare for it-such an idea never entered
my head when a friend suggested it to me
one year ago i laughed at him

  youre kidding me i said

  im not he replied take a look at
this ad

  he pointed to a page ad in a magazine
an advertisement id seen many times but
just passed up without thinking never
dreaming it applied to me this time i read
the ad carefully it told of many big oppor-
tunities for trained men to succeed in the
great new radio field with the advertise-
ment was a coupon offering a big free book
full of information i sent the coupon in
and in a few days received a handsome -
page book printed in two colors telling all
about the opportunities in the radio field
and how a man can prepare quickly and
easily at home to take advantage of these
opportunities well it was a revelation to
me i read the book carefully and when i

seems almost like a dream to me now for
ten of those twelve months ive had a
radio business of my own at first of
course i started it as a little proposition
on the side under the guidance of the na-
tional radio institute the outfit that gave
me my radio training it wasnt long be-
fore i was getting so much to do in the
radio line that i quit my measly little cleri-
cal job and devoted my full time to my
radio business

  since that time ive gone right on up
always under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute they
would have given me just as much help too

satisfied are you making enough money
at work that you like would you sign a
contract to stay where you are now for the
next ten years-making the same money if
not youd better be doing something about
it instead of drifting

of golden rewards the work in any of the
 different lines of radio is fascinating

get this point-that drafting isnt just one line of work-it reaches out
into the electrical manufacturing building construction automotive
and structural industries that is why youll find well-paid drafting
positions advertised in all industrial centers of the u s  vacancies
reported in the past  months and that is why i advise men to go into
drafting particularly if handicapped by lack of high-school or college
education today you are in competition with high-school and college
graduates for the better-paid jobs y ou must have specialized training to win

   the entering wedge to success
   in ail building and manufacturing lines

i recommend drafting too because it can be quickly learned at home in ipare time-with-
out quitting your job without losing a days time or a dollar in pay because youre sure there
will be a good position waiting when you are ready for it and because the work is so fascinat-
ing and offers better-than-ordinary chances for advancement for the draftsman is in close con-

an amazing phenomenon

 by hugo gernsback

mong the most amazing phenomena that human
beings experience are those of premonition and
another which for the lack of a better name
might be called memory phantom

  in the current issue of amazing stories one
of our authors advances an ingenious idea as to a
 anation of these phenomena

  when it comes to the occurrence of premonition i am of
the sincere belief that there is no scientific basis for the exis-
tence of such a supposed phenomenon we all hear frequently
that people have certain premonitions but the trouble is that
they are most difficult to prove

  i	myself have had any number of premonitions in the course
of my life but none of them actually came about in other
words practically all of them were false alarms

  the nearest one that came near being a fulfillment was only
partially fulfilled and had nothing to do with myself at all

  i had gone to europe on the lusitania before the war and
an hour or two before the boat docked at liverpool i remem-
that i had an exceedingly strong premonition that something
dreadful was going to happen something did happen but it
was neither terrifying nor dreadful something happened to
the landing bridge when it was hoisted up and the ropes broke
and the bridge fell down with a crash slightly injuring two
stevedores

  similar occurrences probably happen to most of us but it is
a fact that most of our premonitions if not all of them never
come about and if they do come about we must call them
simply coincidences

   if in a lifetime an individual has fifty premonitions and out
of the fifty one comes near to being true it would hardly be
a convincing proof that there was any scientific reason for sup-
posing that an event could be registered on the human con-
sciousness hours and days before it happened

  on the other hand the phenomenon of memory phantoms
may have an actual foundation of fact and there may be some
scientific basis for it

  the theory which i advance in connection with this phe-
nomenon i believe is new and while it cannot be proven at
least there seems to be a slight scientific foundation for it in
some instances my theory will not cover all facts in the case
of course but will only do so partially

  we all know of the sensation that comes over us in the most
unexpected quarters when we have a feeling that we have seen
the same scene or experienced the self-same thing before we
actually know that we have experienced the self-same thing or
have seen exactly the same scene or have done exactly the same
thing

  i especially remember a particularly strong impression that
i had some years ago when my train sped through a midwest
plain it was the first time that i had ever made that par-
ticular trip and i distinctly remember looking with amazement
at a certain scene which composed an unusual configuration of
the terrain a certain little river and other landmarks i was
immediately struck with the conviction that i had seen exactly
the same scene some time before the feeling was so real

that even today i cannot rid myself of the thought that i actu-
ally some time in the dim past saw that scene nor is it
impossible that i did see the scene it may have been a thou-
sand or five thousand years ago that i actually did see it and
this is how i account for it and how i account for similar
experiences that are had by most of us

  there are about a billion and a half human beings on this
planet they live an average of forty or fifty years and then
all of them vanish to be replaced by a new crop this goes
on and has gone on of course for millions of years what
becomes of the physical bodies after they die we say they
are being decomposed and become part and parcel of our earths
crust again some are buried six feet below the ground others
who die as in combat adventure or otherwise perish in the
open simply decompose where they fall and their remains are
scattered to the four winds

  whatever happens one fact is quite certain and that is that
in our own physical makeup will be found the actual physical
remains of some of our predecessors that these remains are
atomically small makes no difference the fact remains that
the succeeding crops of humans for untold ages have decom-
posed chemically and are again chemically absorbed into other
combinations which later on become parts of human beings
once more this of course is not re-incarnation or anything
like it

  my theory then in short is that a certain human being not
related to me at all had perhaps  years before me seen
a certain scene that particular picture became engraved in
his consciousness and consequently made a record in his
brain it is quite true that after death all sensations stop but
it is possibly quite true that some particle of my predecessors
brain may eventually find its way into my brain in the course
of the passage of time for many years this particle that
carried the original impression may rest in my brain without
acting at all but when i see a certain scene the particle becomes
active in my brain and sends the message that i have seen the
particular scene once before

  and this is perhaps the most plausible explanation of sim-
ilar occurrences which are viewed by us through our own
eyes but through the memory phantoms of other human beings
who have long died but have become crystallized into us

  offhand this may seem a very fantastic theory but it is
certainly not more fantastic than the mechanics of the brain
and the mechanics of memory itself when you stop to con-
sider what memory really is and how incessantly impressions
are made upon the brain and that really no physical impres-
sions are made at all neither in our thinking nor in our mem-
ory the subject probably becomes less difficult it evolves itself
down to perhaps the vibration of certain cells in our brain and
if the vibration is correct either by will or outside influences
we then think or we can recall memories

  a violent blow to our head renders us unconscious because
the brain cells are probably paralyzed and can no longer vibrate
the same as they usually do

  i give the theory for what it is worth and while it very likely
does not fit all cases it may shed some light upon a most inter-
esting and amazing phenomenon

author of the riot at sanderac the puzzle duel etc

ld cladgett president of the first na-
tional bank of collegeburg scowled across
the mahogany table at the miserable young
man he was all hunched up into great
rolls and hanging pouches and he scowled
till the room grew gloomy and the ceiling seemed to
lower

  im running a bank not a charity club he growled
planting his fist on the table

  bookstrom winced and then controlled himself with
a little shiver

  but sir he protested all i ask for is an extension
of time on this note i could easily pay it out in three
or four years if you force me to pay it now i shall
have to give up my medical course

  harsh inchoate guttural noises issued from clad-
getts throat

  this bank isnt looking after little boys and their
dreams he snarled this note is due and you pay it
youre able-bodied and can work

  mechanically as in a daze bookstrom took out a
wallet and counted out the money when the sum was
complete he had ten dollars left the hope that had
spurred him on through several years of hardship and
difficulty the hope of graduating as a physician and
having a practice of his own now was gone he was
at the end of his resources once the medical course
was interrupted he knew there was no hope of getting
back to it nowadays the study of medicine is too
strenuous there is no dally-
ing on the path to an md
degree

  he went straight over to
the university to apply for
an instructorship in ap-
plied mathematics that had
recently been offered to
him

in the movies and in the novels an ogre like cladgett
usually meets with some kind of retribution before
long the black hand gets him or a wronged debtor
poisons him or a brick house collapses on his head
but cladgett lived along in collegeburg growing more
and more prosperous he was bound to grow wealthy
because he took all he could get from everybody and
never gave anybody anything he kept growing a little
grayer and a little fatter and seemed to derive more
and more pleasure and happiness from preying financi-
ally on his fellow-beings and he seemed as safe as the
rock of gibraltar

  then after fifteen years a sudden attack of acute
appendicitis got him that morning he had sat at his
desk and dictated letters to his directors commanding
them to be present at a meeting four days hence without
fail the bank was taking over a big estate as trustee
and unless each director signed the contract personally
the deal was lost and with it a fat fee in the afternoon
he was in bed groaning with pain and cursing the doctor
for not curing him at once

  appendicitis he shrieked impossible

  dr banza bowed and said nothing with delicate
finger-tips he felt of the muscles in the right lower
quadrant of the abdomen he shook his head over the
thermometer that he took out of the sick mans mouth
he withdrew a drop of blood from the patients finger-
tip into a tiny pipette and took it away with him

  he was back in an hour and cladgett read the ver-
dict in his face

  operation he yowled like a whipped boy i cant
have an operation ill die

  he seemed to consider it the doctors fault that he
had appendicitis and would have to have an operation

  say he said more rationally as an idea occurred
to him do you realize that ive got an important
directors meeting in three days  i cant miss that for
any operation now listen be sensible ill give you
a thousand dollars if you get me to that meeting in
good shape

  dr banza shrugged his shoulders

  im going to dinier
now he said in the voice
that one uses to a peevish
child you have two or
three hours in which to
think it over by that time
im afraid you will be an
emergency

 dr banza sauntered
thoughtfully over to the college tavern and walking
in looked around for a table at which to eat his din-
ner he felt his shoulder touched

  sit down and eat with me invited his unnoticed
friend

  why hello bookstrom he cried warmly as he
perceived who it was

  hello yourself returned bookstrom now portly
and cheerful enough with a little twinkle in each eye

  but whats the matter you look dark and dis-
couraged

  so over the dinner banza told his friend about the
annoying dilemma with the obdurate and irascible

 f ur zvell-known author treats us to a different sort of
 -fourth dimensional story here incidently its a very
 clever psychological study-one which will leave you chuck-
 ling and you may well ivonder if the fourth dimension is
 exploited whether we will have situations such as the one
 so well told of in this tale



amazing stories

cladgett who threatened certain ruin to his career

  i feel like telling him to go to hell dr banza
concluded

  bookstrom sat a long time in silent thought his
elbows leaned on the table sizzling a little tune through
his cupped hands

  just the thing ive been looking for he said at
last slowly as though he had come to a difficult de-
cision do you want to listen to a little lecture
banza then you can decide whether i can help you
or not

  if you can help me youre some medicine-man
shoot the lecture though dr banza leaned back
and waited with much outward show of patience

  you remember opened bookstrom that i had a
couple of years of medical college work and had to
quit that accounts for my having gotten this idea
so suddenly just how

  my present title of professor of applied mathe-
matics is not an empty one ive applied some mathe-
matics this time ill tell the world

  you hear a lot about the fourth dimension nowa-
days most people snort when you mention it some
point a finger at you or grab your coat lapel and ask
you what it is i dont know what it is dont get
to imagining that ive discovered what the fourth di-
mension is but i dont know what light is or what
gravitation is except in a pure-mathematics sense
yet i utilize light and gravitation in a practical way
every day do i not

  well ive learned how to utilize the fourth dimen-
sion without knowing what it is and heres how we
can apply it to your cladgett only ive got an ancient
grudge against that bird and hes got to pay me back in
real money for it right now you take your thousand
and get a thousand for me-

  now how can we use the fourth dimension to help
him in order to explain it ill have to illustrate with
an example from a two-dimensional plane of existence
suppose you and cladgett were two-dimensional beings
confined to the plane of this sheet of paper you could
move about in any direction upon the paper but you
could not get upwards off of it here is cladgett
you can go all around him but you cant jump over
him any more than you can turn yourself inside out

  the only way that you a two-dimensional surgeon
can remove an appendix from this two-dimensional
wretch is to make a hole somewhere in his circumfer-
ence reach in separate the doojigger from its attach-
ments and pull it out all limited to the surface of the
paper is that plain so far

  banza nodded without interrupting

  but suppose some professor of applied mathe-
matics arranges it so that you can rise slightly in-
finitely slightly above the plane of the paper then
you can get cladgetts appendix out without making
any break in his circumference all you do is to get
up above him locate your appendix and reach down
or lower yourself down to the original plane and whisk
out the appendix

he being confined to the two-dimensional plane of
the paper cannot see how you do it or comprehend

how but here you are back down to the plane of the
paper again beside cladgett with the appendix in your
hand and he rmkrvels how you did it

  brilliant reasoning dr banza admitted but
unfortunately for its value in this emergency cladgett
is a three-dimensional old hulk and so am i

  to proceed bookstrom made a show of ignoring
the interruption suppose i had constructed an elevator
that could lift you a little ever so little along the fourth
dimension at right angles to the other three then you
could reach over and hook out cladgetts appendix
without making any abdominal wound

bookstrom stopped and smiled banza jumped
to his feet

  well dammit have you he demanded people in
the tavern were turning around and looking at them

  come and see

  they hooked arms and went up to bookstroms la-
boratory apparently banza was satisfied with what
he saw for in five minutes he came racing out of the
door and called a taxi and had himself whirled to
cladgetts house

  there he had some trouble about the two thousand
dollars in advance it was an unethical thing to de-
mand but he was a clever enough psychologist to sense
and respect bookstroms reasons

  ive found a specialist he announced and am
personally convinced that he can do what you want
with the next two days quiet in bed and subsequent
care in diet you can get to the meeting

  go ahead then moaned cladgett

  but this man wants a thousand dollars and insists
that his thousand and mine must both be paid in ad-
vance said banza meekly

  cladgett rose up in bed

  oh you doctors are a bunch of robbers he
shouted then he groaned and fell back again the
appendicitis was too much for him a pain as sus-
tained and long-enduring as that of an acute appendi-
citis will compel anyone to do anything soon cladgett
and a nurse were in an ambulance speeding toward the
university and banza had two checks in his pocket

  bookstrom was all ready a half dozen simple sur-
gical instruments to suffice for actually detaching the
appendix were sterilized and covered he put clad-
gett on a long wooden table and asked the nurse to sit at
his head with a chloroform mask with orders to use it
if he complained he directed banza to scrub his
hands beside cladgett was the elevator

  there wasnt much to the machine all great things
are simple i suppose there were three trussed beams
of aluminum at right-angles to each other each with a
cylinder and plunger and from them toggles coming
together at a point where there was a sort of universal
joint topped by a mat of thick rubber that was all

  you mean for me to get on that thing and be

shoved somewhere into nowhere- banza looked

worried

  i wont insist bookstrom smiled

  no thanks banza backed away with alacrity ill
give him whatever anesthetic he needs banza was no
the appendix and the spectacles



doubt uncomfortable with responsibility for the patient
was seriously ill

  fine bookstrom seemed to be enjoying the situa-
tion thoroughly i still know how to whack off an
appendix thats elementary surgery amateur stuff

  a storm of protest broke from cladgett

  i dont want to be operated you promised-

he wrung his hands and beat his heels upon the table

  we promised said bookstrom sweetly that we
would not open you up youll never find a scratch
on yourself

  cladgett quieted down bookstrom scrubbed his
hands and wrapped his right one in a sterile towel in
order to manipulate the machine he stepped on the
rubber mat and in a moment dr banza and the nurse
were amazed to see him click suddenly out of sight
click and he was not there before they recovered
from their astonishment cladgett began to complain
dr banza had to start giving chloroform he gave it
slowly and cautiously while cladgett groaned and
cursed and threshed himself about

  lie still you fool shouted bookstroms voice in
a preoccupied way just beside them it made their
flesh creep for he was not there

  gradually the patient quieted down and breathed
deeply and the doctor and the nurse took a breath of
relief and had time to wonder about everything there
was another click and there stood bookstrom with a
tray of bloody instruments in his hand

  pippin he exclaimed enthusiastically pointing to
the appendix it was swollen to the size of a thumb
with purple blotches of congestion black areas of gan-
grene and yellow patches of fibrin youre not such
a bad diagnostician banza

  put it in formalin-to show him how sick he

was suggested banza

  youll have a fat time proving to anybody that that
was taken out of him forget it and deposit your
check some day when you get up your nerve let me
show you how it feels to see the inside of a man all
at once everything working

cladgett was much better the next day his
pain was all gone and he did not feel the terrible
prostrating sickness of the day before

  as soon as he awoke he felt himself all over for an
operation wound and finding none mumbled to him-
self surlily for a while the second day his fever was
gone and he was ravenously hungry on the third day
he was merely tired on the fourth day he went to
the directors meeting in his own car grumbling that he
had never had any appendicitis anyhow and that the
doctors had defrauded him of two thousand dollars

  got a notion to sue you for damages may do it
yet he snarled at dr banza ill include the value of
my spectacles you smashed them for me somewhere
damn carelessness

  dr banza bowed himself out

  the next time he needs a doctor he said to him-
self  he can call one from madagascar before ill go
to see him

  but dr banza was no different from any other good

physician it wasnt two weeks before cladgett called
him and again he was fool enough to go as he him-
self expressed it

  this time cladgett was not in bed he was nursing
his hemispherical abdomen in an arm-chair

  thought you said youd cure me of this appendi-
citis he wheezed antagonistically

  aha so you did have appendicitis thought the
doctor to himself aloud he asked cladgett to describe
his symptoms which cladgett did in the popular way
i think its adhesions he snapped

  adhesions exist chiefly in the brains of the laity and
in the conversation of doctors too lazy to make a diag-
nosis dr banzas courteous patience was desert-
ing him

  he temperatured and pulsed his patient gently pal-
pated the abdominal muscles and counted the leuco-
cytes in a drop of blood

  you do have a tender spot he mused and pos-
sibly a slight palpable mass but no signs of any in-
fectious process no muscle rigidity is it getting
worse 

  getting worse every day he groaned histrionically
what is it doc

  dr banza resisted heroically the temptation to tell
him that he had carcinoma of the ovary and said in-
stead with studied care

  i cant be quite sure till we have an x-ray can
you come down to the office

  with much grunting and wheezing cladgett got up
to the office and up on the raidographic table dr
banza made a trial exposure and then several other
films he remained in the developing room for an
interminable length of time and then came out with
a red face

  well what  yapped cladgett

  oh just a trifling matter of no importance come
get into the car with me well drive over to professor
bookstroms laboratory and in a moment well have
you permanently relieved and feeling good

  ill not go to that charlatan again roared cladgett
and you doctors are always trying to talk all around
the bush and refusing to tell people the truth you
cant work that gag on me i want to know exactly
he shook both arms at banza

  why really dr banza acted very much em-
barrassed its nothing that cannot be corrected in

a few seconds-

  dammit shrieked cladgett gimme that x-ray
picture or ill smash up your place

  dr banza went in and got the wet film clipped in
its frame he led the way to the outside door clad-
gett angirly followed him thither and there received
the film banza backed away while cladgett held the
negative up to the light there very plainly visible in
the right lower quadrant of the abdomen was a pair of
old-fashioned pince-ncs spectacles

  strange heavings and tremors seemed to traverse
cladgetts bulk showing through his clothes he shook
and undulated and heaved suddenly in spots his face
turned alternately white and purple his jaw worked up
and down and his mouth opened and shut convulsively


amazing stories

though no sound came forth suddenly he turned and
stamped out of the building carrying the wet film with
him

  the old man was a pretty good judge of character
or he never would have made the money he did in
some subconscious way he had realized that bookstrom
must be the man to see about this thing

  banza telephoned bookstrom at once and told him
the details

  how unfortunate bookstrom exclaimed there
was a suspicious note in his voice that solicitude for
cladgett could hardly have been genuine

  hes coming over there warned banza

  i shall be proud to receive such a distinguished
guest

  that was all banza was able to accomplish he
was sick with consternation and anxiety

  bookstrom could hear cladgetts thunderous ap-
proach down the hall then the door burst open and
a chair went down followed by a rack of charts and
a tall case full of models cladgett seemed to derive
some satisfaction from the havoc this time little dream-
ing that bookstrom was quite capable of setting the
stage for just such a show you-you- sput-
tered cladgett still unable to speak coherently

  too bad too bad consoled bookstrom kindly
lets see your roentgenogram

  ah how interesting bookstrom could put vast
enthusiasm into his voice the question is i suppose
how they got in there he looked back and forth
from cladgetts protruding hemisphere to the spectacles
on the x-ray film as if to imply that in such an im-
mense vault there surely ought to be room for such a
trifling thing as a pair of spectacles

  you put them there you crook you scoundrel you
robber you dirty thief the dirty thief came out
in a high falsetto shriek

 you do me much honor bookstrom bowed
that would be a stunt i might say to be proud of

  you dont deny it do you cladgett suddenly
calmed down and spoke in acidly triumphant tones

  it strikes me bookstrom mused that this is some-
thing that would be difficult either to prove or to deny

  ive got the goods on you cladgett spoke coldly
just as he had on that occasion fifteen years before
you either pay me fifty thousand dollars damages or
this goes to court at once

  my dear sir bookstrom bowed gravely you
or anyone else have a standing invitation to go through
my effects and if you find more than a hundred dol-
lars you are welcome to half of it if you give me the
other half

  cladgett did not know how to reply to this

  im suing you for damages at once his words
came like blows from a pile-driver

  bookstrom bowed him out with a smile

the damage suit created considerable flare in the
headlines a pair of spectacles left in a patients
abdomen at operation that was a morsel such as the
public had not had to scandalize over for some time
newspapers dug up all the details even to the history

of the forced payment on the note fifteen years before
and the disappointed medical student and the fact that
the operation had been performed in secret and at night
in the laboratory of a man who was not a licensed
medical practitioner for bookstroms title of doctor
was a philosophical not a medical one the public
gloated and licked its chops in anticipation of more
morsels at the trial

  but no such treat ever came off immediately the
suit was filed bookstroms counsel requested permission
to examine thoroughly the person of the plaintiff this
was granted the counsel then quietly and privately
called the judges attention to the fact that the plain-
tiffs body contained no scars or marks of operation of
any kind therefore it was evident that he had never
been operated upon and therefore nothing could have
been left in his abdomen the judge held an informal
preliminary hearing and threw the case out of court
he admitted that there were curious phases to it but he
was busy and tired and his docket was so full that it
made him nervous he was glad to forget anything that
was technically settled

  cladgett continued to grow sicker the pain and the
lump in his side increased in another two weeks he
was a miserable man he still managed to be up and
about a little but his face was drawn from suffering
and rage and pains racked him constantly he had
lost twenty-five pounds in weight and looked like a
wretched shadow of his former self

  one day he thrust himself into bookstroms office
bookstrom dismissed the stenographer and the two stu-
dent-assistants and faced cladgett blandly

  banza says you can fix this up somehow he said
and it sounded like gr-r-r-ump gr-r-r-ump r-r-rump
ive decided to let you go ahead

  very kind of you bookstrom purred i ought to
feel humbly grateful for as big a favor as that as a
matter of fact ive decided to let the sultan of sulu go
jump in the lake but ive a lurking suspicion that he
isnt going to do it

  cladgett sat and stared at him awhile and then
picked himself up and stumped out grumbling and
groaning

  the next day dr banza brought him into dr book-
stroms laboratory he eased himself down into a chair
before saying anything

  im convinced that banzas right and that you can
help me now whats your robbers price

  its a highway robbers price with the accent on the
high murmured bookstrom deprecatingly

  well out with it you- there cladgett wisely

checked himself

  i ask nothing whatever for myself said book-
strom suddenly becoming serious but if you want
me to get those spectacles out of you right here and
now you settle a sum to found a students fund to loan
money to worthy and needy scientific students which
they may pay back when they are established and earn-
ing money i think when you spoke to me about a
damage suit you mentioned the sum of fifty thousand
dollars lets call it that

  fifty thousand dollars screamed cladgett in ai
the appendix and the spectacles



high falsetto he was weak and unstable thats
preposterous thats criminal extortion

this transaction is not of my seeking bookstrom
suggested

 youve fixed it all up on me cladgett wailed but
 his voice sank toward the end

tell that to the judge or go to a surgeon and
have him open you up and take them out that would
come cheaper

operation shrieked cladgett i cant stand an
operation

he looked desperately at banza but there was no
hope there

this seems to me a wonderful opportunity banza
said for you to do a public service and distinguish
yourself in the community im sure that amount of
money will not affect you seriously

 cladgett started for the door and then groaned and
 fell back heavily into his chair he sat groaning for
 awhile his suffering being mental as well as physical
 finally he reached into bis pocket for his pen and his
 check-book he kept on groaning as he wrote out a
 check and flung it on the table

now damn you help me he yelped

they put him on the table

banza you scrub you deserve to see this di-
rected bookstrom

so banza stepped on the rubber mat and bookstrom
instructed him

move this switch one button at a time that will
always raise you a notch look around each time until
you get it just right

  with the first click banza disappeared just as peo-
ple vanish suddenly in the movies cladgett groaned
and squirmed and then was quiet with another click
banza reappeared and in his hand was a pair of old-
fashioned pince-nez spectacles moist and covered with
a grayish film he held them toward cladgett who
grabbed them and mumbled something

  can you imagine breathed banza standing in
the center of a sphere and seeing all the abdominal
organs around you at once something like that it
seemed not exactly either there above my head were
the coils of the small intestine to the right was the
cecum with the spectacles beside it to my left the sig-
moid and the muscles attached to the ilium and be-
neath my feet the peritoneum of the anterior abdominal
wall but i was terribly dizzy for some reason i
could not stand it very long much as i should have

liked to remain inside of him for awhile-

  but you werent inside of him corrected book-
strom

  banza stared blankly

  but ive just told you there i was inside of him
with his viscera all around me stomach and diaphragm
in front bladder behind-i was inside of him

  yes it looked that way to you nodded bookstrom
that is the way your brain accustomed to three-
dimensional space interpreted it but look if i draw
a circle on this sheet of paper i can see all points on
the inside of it can i not yet if you were a two-
dimensional being i would have a hard time convinc-
ing you that i am not inside the circle

flight to venus

   by edwin f sloat

i

           ith the subject of interplanetary naviga-
tion now occupying so much of the worlds
attention and the daring and tragic ex-
periences of darnell oshannon peabody
and others still alive in the public mind
i feel that the time is ripe to reveal the true story of
the most famous of all space adventurers prof ran-
dall morteshang and his sensational trip to venus

  there is no need for me to go into detail about
prof morteshang since he is the most discussed in-
dividual who has thrilled this jaded world in the last
half century but i feel that perhaps my version would
be incomplete without roughly outlining the familiar
facts

  prof mortehang it will be remembered made his
attempt to navigatfe space in a rocket somewhat simi-
lar to the one in which his fellow scientist oshannon
last year attempted a trip to mars and lost his life
eightly miles above the earth when the rocket ex-
ploded due presumably to the rapidly dwindlingi air
pressure outside which was needed to equalize some-
what the terrific expansion of exploding gases in the
firing chamber which furnished the machine with its
motive power oshannons rocket was unquestion-
ably of poor construction and did not cost a fraction
of the money morteshang invested in his machine

  it is not necessary for me to go into prof morte-
shangs life before he sprang into worldwide fame
almost overnight on his return from the planet venus
an announcement which led to the hottest controversy
the scientific world has ex-
perienced in more than a
century and in the end re-
sulted in his being com-
pletely discredited by the
public and condemned as
the perpetrator of the great-
est hoax of the age still
for the sake of those who
may have forgotten it may
be well to state that prof

morteshang was an in-
structor in the university of chicago before his great
adventure and was known by the faculty there as a
splendid teacher who possessed a very keen mind and
some startling theories about interplanetary space which
were founded on an amazing knowledge of astronomy
his book on the subject of cosmic rays is still re-
garded as the most conclusive work of its kind in
existence he was about thirty years old unmarried
without relatives but with some money left to him
through the death of an uncle who had raised him
from boyhood

  the earliest experiments in space navigation failed
to interest him but when peabody made his ill-fated
attempt to circumnavigate the moon in his radion globe
with the intention of taking moving pictures of the
dead wastes of our largest satellite and bringing them
back to earth prof morteshang became intensely in-
terested in the subject

  every child now knows what happened to peabody
his radion globe easily climbed out of the gravitation
of the earth and under the anxious eyes trained on
him through every available telescope in the northern
hemisphere sailed bravely out through empty space
toward the full moon peabodys last radio message
sent from  miles out in space stated that every-
thing was working perfectly no one knows just
what took place but the globe lost headway near the
moon came under the influence of its gravitation and
to this day revolves as a satellite round our lunar
neighbor

  for more than a year prof morteshang watched
through the powerful university telescopes the pea-
body globe coursing its unhurried path about the moon
read the endless discussions of the unfortunate adven-
turers plight watched the continual plans for rescue
that always fell through and finally decided on a
great undertaking for himself

was connected with the world television inc
in chicago at that time as a portable-set reporter
my usual assignments were features and human in-
terest pictures so it was in the natural course of events
that the chief should call me into his office one even-
ing with information that
we had received a tip that
a new space navigation at-
tempt was to be made

  it doesnt seem to be
anything very thrilling he
remarked offering me a
cigaret im hoping you
can develop something real
out of it the fellow is
named morteshang and hes
connected with the univer-
sity of chicago says hell give us the details if we
care for them and will go on the screen for a public
statement i wish you would go down to the ovserva-
tory and see what you can find out

  five minutes later with my portable television broad-
casting set i was aboard a jackson park subway ex-
press on the lower level roaring down to the south
side full of hope that i had struck the lead to the
first big news-break in more than a week morteshang
himself opened the door at my ring and invited me
in i found him to be a well built young man with a

 once more we have the interplanetarian story plus
 it is a most unusual story and the author has treated
 the subject ivith care and originality-and what will be of
 still greater interest to our readers is the fact that there
 is a story within the story its name is into darkest
 space and the-author has shown his willingness to write
 this sequel in the near future in which we hope to be able
 to bring you first hand knowledge from venus and its
 strange inhabitants


a trickle of yellow flame suddenly spilled out of the bottom of the steel cylinder high above us it flared and leaped downward to the
earth with a roar like niagara churning up the sandy soil into spray and lighting up fiercely the thousands of ghastly upturned faces


amazing stories

firm chin a vigorous handshake and a gleam in his
eyes that hinted at anything but the traditional retir-
ing disposition of college professors

  glad to know you mr shepherd he greeted me
with a winning smile when i introduced myself i
was rather afraid my little plan would be too common-
place for television in view of the number of space
navigation attempts that have been made and ended
so unfortunately

  i assured him that nothing short of a war an earth-
quake or flood disaster could prove any more interest-
ing to the public just now his eyes flashed with
momentary enthusiasm which was immediately sup-
pressed and he smiled again

  well to get to the point i am planning a trip to
venus in a rocket of my own design he began
needless to say i am sure the venture will be a
success

  he then talked at length on the advantages of
rockets over radion globes ray tripods the sickels
discharge and other actual and theoretical methods of
space propulsion

  in the case of the radion globe such as peabody
used the generating machinery is too complicated the
steerage too clumsy and the propelling power too
feeble he declared why peabody was nearly a
month getting as far as he did no the radion globe
has not the direct thrust of the rocket nor its steering
possibilities

  i made voluminous tape phonographic records while
he talked photographed his blue prints absorbing as
much information as possible myself and arranged to
put him on the theatre screens of the world next
morning

  if you have read my book on cosmic currents and
their effects-which i presume you have not although
they are written for the popular mind-you will real-
ize that one of my biggest obstacles in reaching venus
will be in holding my course through the cosmic stream
which i have named the great current sweeping
about the solar system between the earth and venus
in a very well defined route he remarked it is
perhaps five million miles in width and fully that many
miles deep according to the evidences of my years
survey through telescopic photography of the drift of
meteorites in the case of the radion globe the
radio discharge which propels it is quite feeble and
the globe would undoubtedly be swept out of its course
and taken along with this current-if the electrical
properties of the current did not altogether neutralize
the radio waves something of this sort may have
happened to peabody as he neared the moon with
the rocket however i have a primitive combustion
force that will be unaffected by the electrical properties
of the current and will hurl me at top speed through
the current while the rudder of the rocket acting in
the fire stream will give me sharp and distinct
steerage

  i hurried back to the office jubilantly strangely
enough prof morteshang had notified none of the
other television services giving us a clean scoop i
made the most of it and the theaters of the world

and the television service sets in millions of homes
next morning showed scene after scene of prof
morteshangs plan and his own account of his pro-
posed journey within the hour he sprang from an
obscure university professor to a famous daring
scientist and astronomer the jaded world had found
a new hero to worship

  the world television inc complimented me on
my masterly treatment of the affair and assigned me
to cover it to the end in the weeks that followed i
made trips to gary with prof morteshang where the
great cigar shaped cylinder which was to form the
casing of the rocket was being welded from the tough-
est voicen steel the revolutionary process which
creates steel capable of stretching like rubber rather
than breaking while still retaining its ordinary resis-
tance and tenacity to the fullest degree i broadcast
information about the novel sun compass gravitational
drift gauge speed calculator gravitational meteorite
warning indicator chemical fuel tanks oxygen tanks
and air machine the living quarters the electric light-
ing system the radio set the binocular periscopes
looking both fore and aft in the central control room
and all the rest of the details that the public craved
other vision broadcasters movie men and news writers
by the score hung on the story too but none of them
was given the information and excellent treatment
that i received

ii

six weeks after the first announcement of the
attempt so rapidly did things move i accom-
panied prof morteshang south to miami florida
near the millionaire colony where the start was to be
made

  it is better here than at chicago or new york
he stated miami is much farther south and conse-
quently much nearer the equator where gravity is
somewhat lessened by the centrifugal force set up
by the rotation of the earth to gain the utmost
advantage the start should be made from a mountain
top in ecuador but i am patriotic enough to want it
to be from the soil of the united states so i have
decided on miami

  thousands of people gathered daily about the roped-
off space in which the rocket stood watching the
steeple jacks crawling about like flies on the huge cyl-
inder two hundred feet above the ground a coat of
paint was being given the big projectile to reflect the
light of the sun out in space and make the rockets
progress easier to follw by the astronomers on earth
whose thousands of telescopes would be trained on the
sky for the momentous occasion

  the cylinder which formed the body of the rocket
stood on three titanic steel legs two hundred feet high
which in turn rested on a great circular steel ring
upon the ground making the best surface possible for
the terrain in alighting halfway between the ground
and the cylinder were steel braces which held two
slender steel rudders set at right angles to each other
and receiving their leverage to change the direction of
the rocket by the firestream shooting downward from
flight to venus



the fire chamber which was located in the cylinder

  the cost of the machine was far larger than prof
morteshang had orignally planned he had hoped
to build it for  but as it stood ready for flight
it represented an investment of more than half a mil-
lion dollars this fortunately did not represent the
whole or any part of his original small fortune the
increased sale of his books his magazine articles news
rights and the liberal support of the miami chamber
of commerce financed the whole thing

the day of departure was finally set with plenty
of time to allow the public to arrange for the
event immediately tourists from all over the world
began to flock to florida to be present air lines from
england france and in fact nearly every country in
the world sent fleets of excursion planes to miami
steamship lines brought in their thousands railroads
contributed their throngs private planes from north
and south america filled all the available flying fields
near the city-not to mention the thosands of automo-
biles that jammed the roads leading toward the famous
winter resort officials reported it to be the biggest
single invasion florida hda enjoyed since the historic
land boom far back in  or thereabouts when the
beauties of the state were just coming into prominence

  for more than a mile around the rocket space was
fenced off and reserved for the crowd which paid two
dollars a head to get that near the awesome steel ship
forty-eight hours before the take-off the spectators
began to arrive and enter the parking space bringing
their beds and meals with them special guards were
posted about the rocket in its inner roped-off circle
to protect it from souvenir hunters and possible dam-
age warnings were issued by the state police that
planes must stay out of the air until the rocket left
the ground to prevent possible accidents

  several hours before the take-off i went down to
the rocket for a final inspection of the machine which
was to leave the earth at  pm prof morteshang
was supervising the storage of box after box of chemi-
cals in the strong room above the firing chamber loads
that were brought up from the ground on the freight
elevator and handled by sweating negro laborers

  enough there to drive me for a year if necessary
he remarked waving his hand toward the growing
pile and then smiled at me quizzically by the way
shepherd what are you doing this evening 

  nothing except cover this affair i replied

  i would like to have you come over to my apart-
ment at the hotel for dinner-a strictly informal and
if i might say it a secret affair will you come
with bells on and tickled to death at the chance
i responded promptly

  six oclock found me knocking at his door and
wondering what significance if any the affair might
have in the flight prof morteshang admitted me
grinned in the best of humor and phoned down to
the dining room for a most elaborate meal which in
due time arrived and was served by a scar-faced waiter
in the balcony overlooking the ocean we ate leisurely
and settled back to enjoy our cigarets and a bottle of

the oldest champagne obtainable not until then did
prof morteshang drop his bantering air which he
had maintained throughout the dinner and become
serious

  i have been thinking about you shepherd he
remarked you have really impressed me by the way
you have handled this thing since the beginning and
i have been wondering if you could manage an even
larger proposition along the same lines the subject
is one that i feel extreme delicacy about proposing
and i feel bound to put you upon your honor as a
gentleman to let what is said between use here go no
farther but i really need a partner-someone i can
trust

  i hesitated and cleared my throat diffidently

  the secrecy part is all o k and you may feel
assured that i will not talk but if you are going to
offer me the opportunity of going along with you to
venus that is something i should have to consider
very carefully you see i have my mother to support
and i am sending my kid sister through college be-
lieve me though i would like to go with you

  oh thats all out im not even going myself
he announced calmly

  you-you not going i ejaculated

  sh not so loud he cautioned no i have no
intentions of leaving the earth if i can help it

  but the rocket-the crowds- i floundered

  that part will be taken care of but dont forget
your promise of secrecy eet me explain the whole
thing and perhaps you will understand better i never
intended to go when i made my plans in fact i
dont intend to get more than a few miles off the
earths surface the rocket can go to venus or any
place else it chooses but it shall go alone

  i stared at him half believing he had gone suddenly
mad

  but the public will make you pay for your fun i
protested at last

  you mean the public will pay me for its fun he
corrected with a smile laying his hand on my knee
let me call you by your nickname les and you call
me ran and lets get real informal and confidential
about this venus stunt and talk it over as a couple
of friends if i seem a trifle cocksure about the whole
affair please forgive me for it is the first big thing
i have ever attempted

ow to begin at the beginning i got this
whole idea from watching that hellish globu-
lar tomb of popr peabody floating round and round
the moon i knew him slightly-a pleasant chap who
was in my astronomy class at the u in my soph year
i mulled over his experience a great deal and finally
arrived at some conclusions peabody tried to go
to the moon because the public wanted someone to
he sacrificed his life his savings and left a young
widow to mourn his loss trying to achieve that empty
bubble fame and riches doubtful rewards that he
thought would be his on returning from his lunar
adventure proof of his discovery to put on the auc-
tion block for the public would have been several


amazing stories

thousand feet of moving picture film of the lunar
mountains and desert wastes which could have been
faked far more realistically in any studio and i doubt
very much whether they would have equalled the tele-
photo studies we have made of that body through our
telescopes

  it is more than lkiely that the public would have
raised the cry of fake before he had done very
much toward collecting his fortune-you know there
are a considerable number of persons even now who
believe that he never left the earth-and he might
have lost out altogether after all his attempt was
practically suicide from the start as all such adventures
are bound to be and utterly futile the public is to
blame

  so after arriving at this conclusion i decided i
could make a neat little fortune give the public a big
thrill with practically no danger to myself and then
thrill it again by disillusionment and collect for that

  i planned to build a big rocket start in it off the
ground drop out in a parachute before i got too high
and on reaching the ground go into hiding for a year
-make a trip to south america and visit the upper
amazon a thing i have always longed to do at the
end of that time i could leave behind me half buried
in the mud of some primitive swamp a duplicate
rocket and return to tthe world with the announcement
that i had come back from venus after the first
excitement i would turn the medals and awards back
to the various societies and nations that presented them
to me and then come out with a book disclosing the
truth showing the ease with which the public may be
duped and the utter futility of any sane attempt at
interplanetary navigation i ought to make a million
and the public ought to learn a lesson

  he paused i stared at the ceiling deep in thought

  where do i come in i asked finally

  you are to help me write the book and handle the
publicity a thing you can do much better than i at
least half the success of the venture so far has been
due to you ill either pay you a salary-a big one-
or give you a third of the royalties all you have to
do is to keep mum until you hear from me and then
consider yourself hired

  sounds more than fair to me i declared ill
accept-on the royalty basis but ill tell you frankly
that i have my doubts the public i have learned is
a very very funny animal it may fool both of us
badly before we are done with this affair however
ill stick with you just the same

  we shook hands on the deal and drank a final glass
of champagne to its success and left the hotel for the
rocket enclosure i was somewhat startled to see the
big missile canting badly to the northwest as we made
our way through the milling crowd and called rans-
he was no longer professor morteshang to me-
attention to it

  thats to give me a better opportunity of getting
out in my chute he whispered tell em that i
needed the advantage of remaining in the atmosphere
as long as possible to get its added resistance to the
combustion thrust it is a legitimate reason too

the crowd broke into a mighty cheer as ran was
recognized entering the gate of the fenced off
space about the rocket flashlights thundered movie
men cranked frantically and the television reporters
danced around to get the best focus possible with their
sets as he mounted the freight elevator taking me with
him and ascended to the door of the cylinder

  as we entered the control room i stared about 
curiously

  is all this paraphernalia and machinery a fake like
the rest of the idea i asked

  not a bit of it was his prompt response this
whole rocket and everything connected with it-ex-
cepting myself-is genuine and of the best materials

i didnt dare to fake this thing for fear the scientists
might become suspicious and i also got a lot of
satisfaction out of making the machine as perfect as
possible as it stands a man with the inclination and
any kind of luck could actually go to venus in it

  well it is nearly time to start so ill put on my
chute and get my flashlight ready luck to you les
and take good care of yourself till you hear from me

  i grinned as we shook hands

  have a good time in south america ran i said
youll probably bring back an amazon for a wife
and call her a venus-which may be proof of some-
thing or other

  his laughter followed me out of the little doorway
and i entered the elevator i heard the steel door
click shut behind me and saw his smiling face through
the heavy glass

  the elevator descended with a rush no sooner had
it touched the ground than the workmen hurried me
to safety outside the -yard limit in which the rocket
stood grim and awe-inspiring but beautiful under the
battery of searchlights playing on it all about the
circle were thousands of silent spectators crushed to-
gether in a black mass with their upturned faces gleam-
ing i glanced overhead at the brilliantly jewelled
dome of the heavens waiting to receive the rocket a
great crash startled me although i knew what it was-
the collapse of the -foot elevator which had been
toppled over out of the way of the rockets base the
crowd swayed with excitement the luminous dial of
my wrist watch showed  oclock

  a trickle of yellow flame suddenly spilled out of
the bottom of the steel cylinder high above us it
flared and leaped downward to the earth with a roar
like niagara churning up the sandy soil into spray
and lighting up fiercely the thousands of ghastly up-
turned faces the crowd shrank back the roaring
crescendoed into the giant diapason of a hurricane
the flame seemed suddenly longer i became aware
that the rocket was already high above the earth and
hurtling off into the northwest smaller and smaller
shrank the tail of fire until it became only a huge yel-
low star that slowly dwindled to nothing i plunged
through the swirling cheering thousands to the tele-
vision broadcasting shack with its glowing tubes whir-
ring machinery and bawling announcers

  astronomers in both european and american ob-
servatories picked up the silvery oval of the rocket as
flight to venus



it came into sunlight beyona the shadow of the earth
and followed it far into space it disappeared in less
than half an hour after its departure

  a faint flash of yellow fire was seen some time
later which astronomers believed came from the rocket
-prof morteshang at this point evidently decided
to increase his speed hyman the glober television
and broadcasting service reporter declared

  i laughed as i listened and wondered if that brilliant
surmise was not amusing ran in his hiding place in
northwest florida or georgia where his parachute de-
scent must have carried him hyman had suffered
badly throughout the affair how he would have
exulted if he had known the truth and how he would
have aired the facts before the world

ill

weeks grew into months before the public
interest in the event died down to normal i
went about my work as usual carrying a new
earth induction wrist watch of forty-odd jewels which
cost the directors of the world television inc five
hundred dollars and was given me as an expression
of their esteem for the splendid way i had handled
the morteshang affair i must confess that my con-
science was not altogether at ease over the gift in-
cidently i was assigned to cover the return wherever
it might occur i enjoyed another private chuckle
over that angle of the affair too

  winter changed to spring and spring matured into
summer but no word came from ran hints that
he might have been destroyed by a meteorite or have
perished from the extreme cold out in the black void
of space-or perhaps had become a satellite as pea-
body had-begun to be heard i was becoming a trifle
uneasy and was scanning every news dispatch from
south america then one day i received my message
it came in a badly worn envelope which bore the post
mark of nome alaska and was in rans handwriting

come at once need you badly-ran it read

  a glance at the aerial time tables showed me that
the tourist plane service to alaska had been discon-
tinued two weeks before i could catch a de luxe
night passenger plane for seattle and board a steamer
there for the north the next morning but decided
against it the message said come at once that
meant faster time than a coasting vessel or the
slower rail connections could make i caught up my
overcoat and dashed for the elevator dropping down to
the subway station sixty floors below and shot out to
my apartment in evanston where i packed my bag
and came hurtling back through the lower level tube
at a mile a minute to the field museum station a
pick-me-up taxi hurried me out to the mail plane
hangars on soldiers field where i managed to board
a big mail monoplane through the use of my reporters
card and arrived at nome next morning

  the northland was already a snow-covered deso-
late waste i shivered in spite of the tropic warmth of
the big tourist hotel as i entered the lobby almost
immediately a stocky fur-clad man approached and
introduced himself as dennis mccargell and my guide

to lead me to ran he bore a letter which identified
him we waited only long enough to purchase fur
clothing for me and started on our way by dog sled

  i will not dwell on the chilly painful details of our
trip excepting one incident which caused a great deal
of inconvenience later while we slept one night the
huskies urged on by their wolfish hunger tore open
my pack and destroyed my portable television broad-
casting set for the sake of its leather casing there
was nothing i could do except to pick up the pieces next
morning

  about a week after leaving nome we reached a val-
ley between high snow-draped mountains within the
arctic circle a valley wherein lay an exact duplicate
of the morteshang rocket under the shoulder of a hill
the machine was tipped grotesquely on its side as
though it had been smashed by the impact of falling
from the skies the twisted broken landing gear was
most realistic quarter of a mile distant stood a large
miners cabin with a smoking chimney we paused on
the edge of the valley

  what a god-forsaken spot this is i exclaimed
involuntarily i wonder why he didnt stick to south
america

  i checked myself and could have bitten my tongue
off as i suddenly recollected my stocky dour scotch
guide beside me he apparently took no notice of my
words so i let them pass we plowed our way down
the hillside and crossed the valley to the cabin mc-
cargell pushed open the door and we entered

  i glanced about curiously a red hot stove stood at
one end of the big room-i was surprised at the size of
the building-and beside it stood a slender girl and a
young man fur-clad like ourselves he eyed us rather
haughtily it seemed to me a bed stood against the
wall near the window close by mccargell led me to it

  there he is poor lad he said

under the covers lay ran with wasted cheeks and
eyes that were bright with fever the girl pushed
her way imperiously between mccargell and me to see
what we were doing i glanced down at her profile
and received a distinct shock where the average hu-
man being glows with a pinkish color from the tint of
the blood beneath the skin her flesh showed a delicate
green tint a pale lovely hue that was utterly entrancing
i marvelled her hair was long and black and shot
through here and there with a dark greenish strand
she glanced up at me defiantly with great luminous
eyes that glowed with an amber flame in their depths
i noted too that her features were flawlessly beauti-
ful but her gaze made me feel uncomfortable i hur-
riedly turned my attention to ran

  he was delirious from pneumonia and mumbled
strange words and phrases as he tossed about until the
girl laid a cooling hand on his forehead he became
quiet at once and fell into a fitful slumber i looked
up at her leave him to me her eyes said as distinctly
as though she had spoken the words i obediently
turned to the stove and removed part of my outside
fur clothing

  tell me what happened i asked mccargell


amazing stories

  nothing much to tell he replied stolidly getting
out his pipe this is my cabin and i was out pros-
pectin and trappin on the other side of the range for
a couple of weeks when i came back i saw that big
machine whatever it is against the hill over there
where it had been wrecked and these folk were all
in here with the fire going the young lad and lassie
cant talk english there is an old woman too green
like they are thats asleep in the next room where she
an the lassie stay the old one dont get out of bed
at all on account of the cold

  him under the covers there had been out mining
coal for the stove from the outcrop on the hillside
thats where he caught his cold he didnt think it
would be so bad at first then he sent me down to
nome with the letter for you

  how did he get the machine here i asked

  how do i know i wasnt here he countered
must of fell out of the sky some kind of a new
doodad for flying over the pole i guess

  i sat down perplexed the girl rose and came to me
she produced a small red leather bound volume from
the bosom of her parka eskimo skin garment handed
it to me and returned to the bed i opened the book
haphazardly and glanced at a page near the beginning

  am nearing venus on the sunny side i read
the glare from the fog mantle that covers the planet
is terrific i had to smoke a portion of the window
and the periscopes through which i am watching i
have opened the firing chamber and with the rudders
have turned the rocket over so that i can ease it down
to the surface of the planet right side up with the
pressure of the discharge to act as a brake and a land-
ing cushion i only hope i am not coming down over
on ocean

  great stuff nothing could be better for our book
than a nice juicy diary or log of the trip ran evi-
dently was leaving nothing undone to make our ven-
ture a success i turned over a few pages

  i entered cherwa the capital city this morning
triumphantly escorted by a guard of honor of these
beautiful green people i wish i could describe ade-
quately the fairy-like beauty of the town with its stately
ornamented walls of marble and its wide welcoming
gates slender towered buildings that remind nie of
oriental minarets rise proudly behind the walls and
tall fronded trees like long-handled feathered fans
grace the wide marble avenues how  wish that les
could be with me to enjoy it all

  i frowned that last sentence was out of place and
would have to be deleted

  how he and i would laugh over that wild scheme
of mine that we discussed back there in miami the night
of my departure a scheme which if carried out would
have robbed me of this wonderful adventure

  i gasped as the truth dawned upon me and turned
frantically to the first page of the diary

  the joke is on me but i do not greatly mind it
in fact i am rather glad that things have turned out
as they did the earth like a great black ball with
a crescent silver rim is lying behind me and i am
hurtling through an empty void with the great red sun

and its flaring rays shooting hundreds of thousands of
miles into space off to my left and above below and
all about are balls of fire of varied colors that are
worlds and suns in themselves the distant ones show-
ing only as fiery points of light against the black vel-
vet curtain of eternal space it is all rather awe-in-
spiring but nothing that frightens me i only regret
that i cannot do its description more justice

  all this great adventure is occurring because i
dropped the key to the door of the rocket at the critical
instant after my take-off at miami as i hurriedly
thrust it at the keyhole the key slipped from my fin-
gers and fell to the floor where it slid under a pile of
chemical boxes that had not been stofed away by the
time i upset the pile and retrieved it my opportunity
to leave the rocket had passed i was already hundreds
of miles off the earth and my speed was increasing
every instant to dive out into the frigid empty void
would have been certain suicide i could either turn
the rocket about and go back to earth again or con-
tinue on my proposed trip to venus i chose the lat-
ter

  after making my decision i released another charge
into the firing chamber and felt by the pressure of my
feet on the floor a burst of renewed speed the flame
leaped backwards for hundreds of miles i have calcu-
lated my speed from the position of the sun mars and
the earth and find that i am travelling in excess of a
million miles an hour i shall increase this shortly
speed out here is only a relative matter after all and
a million miles an hour seems no swifter than ten or
twelve knots aboard an ocean freighter or two hundred
in an airplane i experienced some difficulty in getting
around through the interior of the rocket because there
is no gravity to hold me down but otherwise there is
no discomfort the machinery is functioning per-
fectly

 closed the volume and stared about me in
amazement he had really done it these green
folk were truly children of another planet what a
book-a true book-we should write and how we would
thrill the world i turned eagerly back to the diary

  there is neither the space nor the time here to record
in full what i read there i would not weary my read-
ers if i could for the volume is included almost com-
plete in rans autobiography into darkest space
which has gone through more than a hundred editions
and has been translated into every language on earth
it is all too familiar if any of its chapters have been
forgotten the book my be had at the nearest public
library where i grieve to say it has probably been
placed among the works of fiction

  mccargell stamping in from the outside interrupted
me before i had finished reading the diary

  snowin he announced laconically were stuck
for the winter

  i sprang to my feet

  but ive got to get back to nome i exclaimed

  no use tryin by morning well be lucky to see
out of the windows

  i raved but in vain for he was right and in the face
flight to venus



of the elements we were as helpless in our super-civil-
ized world as the most primitive savage snow-bound in
his mountain cave till spring because we had no means
of getting back to civilization to send a plane after us
and bring a doctor for ran the radio set of the rocket
had been hopelessly shattered when the big machine
crashed on the mountainside as ran was trying to bring
it down through a heavy storm to get his bearings and
my portable television set had been too badly broken
up by mccargells huskies to be repaired so i re-
signed myself to our fate and started to work at once
on the book of the great adventure while loama the
green girl with the emerald blood of venus princes in
her veins nursed ran back to health

  hers was the harder task at first when he hovered on
the border line and we all waited anxiously until the
crisis had passed and he had fallen into a restful slum-
ber from which he emerged weak but released from the
delirium loama exhausted by her long vigil slept in
her chair at the bedside holding his hand

  hello les he greeted me faintly with a smile
when he recognized me knew you would come when
you received my letter i see you know the truth about
my trip must have read the diary we have our
chance now at something real instead of a paltry hoax

  i should say so i agreed heartily you have
made history old man but well talk more about it
after you have rested

  his recovery was rapid and he could scarcely wait
until we had finished the first draft of the book

  it means far more than you realize les he de-
clared the races of venus have long since perfected
space navigation and bring in rare woods metals and
chemicals from the planet mercury which is so hot
that human life cannot exist there for any length of
time they will be coming to earth next seeking col-
onization

  why havent they come before i asked

  we have been protected by the great cosmic cur-
rent i told you about the green people use an elec-
trical force similar to an electric discharge for their
space propulsion the peculiar electrical properties of
the great current nullify the effects of the discharge
and the ships are swept away helplessly to fall ulti-
mately i presume into the sun no less than a hun-
dred adventurers have set forth bravely to reach the
earth in the last score of years and have never been
heard of since the scientists of venus were at a loss
to know what happened to them until i explained the
current which had no effect on the primitive combustion
force of my rocket

  these and many other facts that are included in
into darkest space i learned from ran first hand
as he lay in his bed under the watchful eyes of the
green princess who often imperiously gestured to me
to stop talking and let him rest when he seemed a bit
weary i could never learn more than a few words of
her language and those i must confess sounded all
alike for it required the most delicate shading of tone
to convey their meaning in his book ran says the
vocabulary of the whole language is limited to only a
few score of spoken words as a base for the pyramid

of the most highly developed communication in the
universe which is carried on by direct inference through
the eyes-a sort of mental telepathy the system of
writing is extremely complicated and bears no relation
whatever to the spoken words although it is as capable
of bearing the burden of cultured literature and deep
philosophic discussion as any of the languages of the
earth ran learned the spoken language through hyp-
notic treatment over a period of many weeks and had
mastered the rudiments of the written language dur-
ing his sojourn on venus

loama and her brother vomi and their old slave
i governess disdained to learn english as something
too primitive and harsh i noticed that none of them
experienced the slightest difficulty in making their wants
known through their expressive glances

  these two children of venus looked upon mccargell
and myself at first in about the same light as they
regard their slaves at home but they revered ran as
a veritable demi-god proving it not only by accompany-
ing him back to earth but also as those familiar with
his book will recall by rescuing him from the unknown
society that radical organization of venus scientists
which held him prisoner and determined that he should
never leave that planet until they searched and exam-
ined the innermost depths of his mnid by hypnosis as a
biologist might dissect a living frog provided the
experience had not resulted in his death ran would
have survived it only to be a babbling idiot for the
remainder of his life

  knowing the resourcefulness of loama and the utter
fearlessness of her brother i do not marvel at the
way they immediately armed themselves with atomic
ray machines as soon as they learned of rans predica-
ment and cut their way into the steel vault in the base-
ment of the cherwa academy where he lay helpless
in hypnotic stupor on the raised marble slab ready for
the first experiments of the unknown society in the lec-
ture room above i can easily vision the blackness of
the night the cold drenching rain that begins at dusk
and continues intermittently for two hours from the
overhanging cloud canopy of the planet and there un-
der the base of the academy wall wet to the skin and
with teeth chattering loama and her brother at work
dissolving with their pistol-like ray controls the marble
and steel between themselves and the secret vault while
the members of the unknown society were gathering
in the lecture hall how they must have hurried to
seize his unconscious form between them and flee out
into the street just as the lights flashed on and the
floor above the chamber began to open i can ap-
preciate too loamas determination to keep ran hid-
den in her own bed chamber during the ensuing excite-
ment while court detectives under the orders of her
father the king ferreted out the names of the un-
known society and put every member to death there
was no other place she could be sure of his safety

  often i watched loamas lambent eyes blaze and
leap in the firelight shining from the open door of
the red hot stove as she dwelt among the memories of
her homeland on that other planet where the sky is

always white and hazy under the eternal cloud canopy
and summer rules the land the long arctic night here
on earth with the aurora borealis flaming outside in
the intense stillness of the deep cold was surely con-
trast enough to make her homesick all three must
have suffered severely from the cold although they
continuously wore the fur clothing supplied by mc-
cargell

our imprisonment came to an end when the sun
peeped again over the southern horizon and
the snow on the mountain-sides started seaward
down the foaming churning gullies and creeks we
packed our stuff as soon as possible and began our
long trek back to nome by dog sled ran left the
faithful old rocket with deep regret it had not been
seriously damaged by the crash in landing or by the
winters cold he said it could well be used again
loama hung on his words wistfully

  i could scarcely wait to reach nome and announce
to the world the safe return of prof morteshang
immediately on reaching the little city i sought out the
world television inc station there and introduced
prof morteshang and his three companions from
venus to the millions of people throughout the world
who at that moment were watching television screens
in theatres and homes then i sought out the mail
station and made arrangements to start for chicago on
the next mail plane

  before we had been under way an hour the radio
operator began to receive messages of congratulation
offers of theatrical contracts requests of autographed
books and photos and invitations to attend public and
private functions from all parts of the delighted and
astonished world at the canadian border we were
met by an escadrille of municipal planes from chicago
to escort us the rest of the way to soldiers field
our escort grew rapidly from then on as private planes
hove into view from all points on the horizon to swell
our triumphant progress

  soldiers field was crowded to capacity by cheering
thousands who even swarmed over the plane runways
leaving us scarcely room enough to alight when we
opened the door of the cabin and stepped out we were
greeted by the blaring of bands and cheering of the
crowd special police fought back the eager specta-
tors while the official committee of welcorne took charge
and escorted us from the field throughout the world
theatres were packed to the doors with people who were
devouring the television account of the affair

  our fortune was made and prof morteshangs name
as a scientist and discoverer would go down-through
the ages as immortal it seemed millions of dollars
in movie contracts were offered not only to him but
to princess loama and her brother as well ran ig-
nored the offers his companions laughed first in amuse-
ment then in contempt they care nothing for silver
screen fame nor in fact for anything of the earth
which they regarded in about the same light as that in
which a confirmed new yorker looks on life in pata-
gonia

  rans refusal came from a sincere hope that his
accomplishment might result in the betterment of the
human race in the future-a view that contrasted
strongly with his original plan of bilking the public out
of a fortune he laughed a little shamefacedly to me
about that original scheme and resolved never to reveal
it to another living soul he would probably become
wealthy as a side issue but he resolved never to use
his tremendous fame as a lever to hoist himself into
a vast fortune in the world of the theatre he ex-
pressed this view at a famous banquet harking back
into history as he did so

  i often heard my grandfather tell of his boyhood
memories of the way the world idolized charles lind-
bergh the first aviator to fly from new york to paris
in a non-stop flight he said lindebergh or lindy
as he was affectionately called turned down numberless
chances to commercialize his great popularity passing
them all by in the interests of national welfare no
man in a similar position could set a higher ideal before
us than the example of that intrepid aviator

  that banquet with the presentation of the congres-
sional medal for the greatest accomplishment of the
year and its accompanying  which was pre-
sented by the president of the united states himself
marked the high tide in the career of prof marteshang
the very next morning while listening to the radio
news dispatches of the world at breakfast i heard a
statement by prof hibbs the harvard astronomical
authority that there was something strange about the
landing spot of prof morteshang on his return from
venus it was as follows

  the mountain in northern alaska it will be noted
is directly under the course taken by the rocket after
it took off in florida it will be recalled that prof
morteshang started his flight at a very low angle which
could easily have resulted in the rocket passing over
alaska at a height of but a few miles above the earth
before darting off into empty space the angle of
flight excited quite a discussion at the time in scientific
circles and there were a number of scientists who were
not altogether satisfied with morteshangs reason of
added air resistance at the start of the flight these
scientists still raise the question

  i hurried to the amidon hotel where ran and his
proteges were staying he had heard the statement
too and was considerably disturbed by it we at once
understood the motive behind the statement it came
through the news release of the globe television and
radio service and i recognized in it the hand of hy-
man who had played second fiddle to me throughout
the preparations and take-off of the rocket flight ran
contributed further

  that man hibbs once suffered considerable em-
barrassment from a criticism i wrote of one of his
books he has never forgiven me

hibbs statement created no great stir but within
a week another attack was made by the globe
gang hyman uncovered the fact that ran had bought
a parachute shortly before his departure this bit of
news following hibbs statement created a real sen-
flight to venus



sation we held a consultation and decided to ignore
the implication of fraud but by the next day such a
controversy had arisen that ran felt that it was nec-
essary to come forward with an explanation that he
had taken the chute as a possible safeguard against
a crash landing either on venus or the earth a precau-
tion on a par with the equipping of trans-continental
passenger planes with chutes and placing lifeboats on
ocean liners

  this explanation did much to quiet the controversy
but we were frankly worried ran saw his great ac-
complishment threatened with destruction and perhaps
the end of his ambition to take a scientific and diplo-
matic mission to venus to bring about a better under-
standing between the peoples of the two worlds no
doubt existed in our minds but that the globe service
had planned a definite campaign to discredit ran and
we waited nervously to see where the next point of
attack would be it came from an altogether new source
and fairly made us gasp at the devilish ingenuity of it

  dr humphreys owner of the famous humphreys
sanitarium for nervous disorders located at los an-
geles came forward with a statement that the peculiar
green color of the so-called children of venus who
had been introduced to the public by prof morteshang
as proof of his visitation to the planet venus was not
unknown on earth although by no means common
valvular trouble of the heart which so often gives in-
fants a blue color had been known to impart to some
patients a greenish tinge and digestive troubles often
result in the same color he declared however he
concluded three such ideal cases as the children of
venus would be rather unusual

  we could make no reply to that vomi would have
made an answer in his princely fashion that would
have terminated all opinions of that publicity seeking
physician very suddenly and painfully if we had per-
mitted the inference that vomi was sickly or diseased
was an insult to his royal blood which in his homeland
would have been erased on the field of honor or any
other convenient spot

  the public did not become greatly excited over dr
humphreys opinion but the belief of fraud was grow-
ing a score of speaking and banquet invitations
which had been scheduled for the near future for prof
marteshang were postponed or cancelled by societies
and municipalities in various parts of the country ran
was forced to call off a speaking tour through the east-
ern states he raved to us but there was nothing that
we could do without openly involving ourselves in the
controversy a thing i was trying desperately to avoid

  another attack against us was made by prof hibbs
while speaking at a luncheon of the academy of science
in new york he declared the academy had acted
prematurely in presenting its medal and  award
to prof morteshang without investigating more thor-
oughly the circumstances of the affair the golden op-
portunity had passedsince such an investigation should
have been made as soon as possible after the landing
of the rocket but better late than never a committee
appointed by the academy should without delay voyage
by plane to northern alaska and look thoroughly into

the wreck of the rocket and interview the miner mc-
cargell

  the assembled members considered the question with
much gravity and appointed the committee which was
to start the following week in a specially chartered
plane accompanied of course by the usual train of
television broadcasters moving picture men newspaper
correspondents and others

  we were dumfounded at the action of the academy
but felt it best to maintain our policy of watchful wait-
ing as publicity director however i made one excep-
tion and sent a statement to the world television inc
that prof hibbs dislike for prof morteshang dated
back several years to a criticism of a book treating on
hibbs theories regarding the planetismal theory a
criticism which was almost universally approved by the
worlds astronomers i was amazed and somewhat
alarmed that the statement failed to appear on the tele-
vision screens i also realized that the world tele-
vision had not assigned me to accompany the academy
expedition our position was indeed becoming precari-
ous we could only await the findings of the commit-
tee which would shortly be announced

that report startled the world and left us dazed
in dismay and astonishment we were all five
seated with the usual audience in the television room of
the amidon hotel when chairman corsepius of the
rocket investigating committee appeared on the screen
and made the following statement from northern alaska
via the portable television sets accompanying the party

  there are no remains of any rocket on this mountain
or in this vicinity where prof morteshang and his
three green-hued companions claim to have alighted
on their return from venus our investigating com-
mittee has found only a few rusty steel bridge girders
which have evidently been brought here by dog sled
from nome and unloaded carelessly at the base of the
mountain as we shall show you presently

  of mccargell there is no trace in nome it is re-
ported that he appeared there shortly after prof mor-
teshang announced his return to the world mccargell
showed his friends a large roll of currency and said
he was leaving at once for his native scotland

  we shall now show you the remains of the alleged
rocket and the mccargell cabin which is now vacant

  dumfounded we stared at the change of scene show-
ing the old bridge girders dumped carelessly in the
snow and listened to the caustic comments of the
committee members about them the scene changed
abruptly to tokyo where in the early morning hours
a disastrous fire was raging in the geisha girls quar-
ters under cover of the screaming girls and the
clanging fire apparatus we crept out of the room and
hurried to rans apartment

  within ten minutes i received a special delivery let-
ter from the world television inc notifying me that
my services were no longer required by that corpora-
tion another letter next morning was received from
the president of the univesity of chicago informing
ran that his resignation would be accepted at once
during the remainder of the week bell boys brought


amazing stories

letters and telegrams from banquet and reception com-
mittees all over the country informing us that affairs
at which prof morteshang was to appear had been
called off

  out of all this welter came one cheerful announce-
ment it was from our literary agent informing us
that the sales of into darkest spa-ce were steadily
mounting and the financial returns from this and the
news rights with their various ramifications had already
topped two and a half millions of dollars and in a short
time would total more than five millions

  ran read the statement wearily dropped it on the
floor and resumed his endless pacing from one end of
the room to the other with his knuckles clenched be-
hind his back and his face disfigured by the frown he
had worn for days he was haggard from the loss of
sleep and appetite loama seated beside me watched
with genuine concern but without comment vomi
maintained a sympathetic masculine silence abruptly
ran halted before us

  why cant they quit hounding me he burst out
what have i done to deserve this treatment have
i tried to injure anyone have i not opened up a
wonderful new phase of human experience for man-
kind and am i not trying to work for the betterment
of two worlds 

  this persecution is only the result of jealousy and
hatred of course i assured him the people of the
world are confused and misled when the truth be-
comes known they will turn on hyman hibbs and that
gang even more unmercifully than they have treated
you you are being martyred-temporarily-but you
will haveyour turn do not feel too badly about the
affair and if need be regard this episode only as a
touch of poetic justice for that original foolishness you
devised to fool the public

  that is what hurts the worst he exclaimed such
a wonderful thing has resulted from my paltry little
plan of getting a few dollars from the public and now
the public is refusing to believe in me 

  he started pacing the floor again i sprang up and
caught his arm

  stop worrying ran i said well make a trip
of our own to alaska and see if we can find some trace
of the rocket-it is no easy matter to hide tons of steel
like that-and well get a detective to find mccargell
and get a written statement from him containing the
truth of the matter

  he shook his head dolefully

  a statement wouldnt do any good if he did make
it he replied the public would be made to believe
that we bought it from him

  i knew he was right but i refused to admit it and
began to search my mind for some hot counter-attack
to launch against our enemies

we never started the search for the missing rocket
nor did we put a detective on the trail of mc-
cargell for something took place that afternoon which
convinced ran that there was no possibility of restor-
ing his reputation before the public again since the
report of the rocket committee we had secluded our-

selves in the apartment refusing to see any visitors
our meals were served there and we also installed a
private television receiving outfit to prevent the un-
pleasant experience of using the one in the hotel and
meeting the public

  we had just finished luncheon and were sitting about
the room facing the television screen while the events
of the world occurred before us sensational testimony
in a murder trial in new orleans had halted while the
court recessed and we were about to change to a
theatrical wavelength and attend a musical show in new
york when the bell announcing important news jangled
loudly the scene shifted to the wardens office in the
federal penitentiary at atlanta a man in prison garb
with a scar across his right cheek was about to speak
something vaguely familiar about him stirred my curi-
osity before he was introduced

  the warden informed us that the prisoner was al-
fred smith serving a sentence for using the mails to
defraud and had something of vital importance to say
about the morteshang affair before the prisoner had
spoken a dozen words both ran and i recognized him
as the waiter who had served our farewell dinner in the
miami hotel on the night of the rocket take-off smith
said he had hidden in the room off the balcony and
had overheard ran tell me all the details of the proposed
fraud including the parachute descent the exploration
trip up the amazon and all the rest smith explained
his previous silence by declaring frankly that he had
planned to extort enough money from us on the ex-
piration of his sentence to live comfortably for the rest
of his life

  the ways things have turned out the world will
know all about it before i am free and my knowledge
would do me no good he concluded i might as well
spread the glad tidings now while everybody is inter-
ested and get what fun i can out of it

  we waited in vain for him to tell the rest of the
plan-how we planned to disillusion the public and
turn back the awards but he said nothing about it he
had been too well coached for that i know

  ran stared at the screen with tragic eyes noama
put her arm about him and wept while vomi strode
about the room white with rage cursing fluently in his
native tongue i could only grit my teeth in anger

  ran accepted his defeat stoically and no amount of
urging on our part to fight back could change his mind
vomi with the hotheaded impulse of youth wanted to
seek out hibbs and hyman forthwith and force the
truth about their part in the conspiracy against ran
from them i must confess that i was with him heart
and soul in that proposal and yearned for nothing bet-
ter than to choke either the truth or the life out of
hyman with my bare hands ran would hear nothing
of it he would not even make a statement for the pub-
lic

  later in the afternoon the new york television an-
nouncer informed us that the government universities
and various scientific societies would probably file suit
to force prof morteshang to return the medals and
awards nothing developed along that line however
for that night we mailed the medals and checks for the
flight to venus



awards back to every society college city organization
and individual that presented them including congress

  ran and i spent most of the night at this while
loama vomi and their slave governess packed suitcases
and trunks in the early morning hours we disap-
peared leaving only a vacant apartment to greet the
hordes of news men camera men television reporters
attorneys and the rest that descended on it next morn-
ing and gave the world another thrill by announcing
our mysterious disappearance

the story of prof morteshang and his sensa-
tional trip to venus ended there as far as the world
was concerned he has never been seen in public
since and i am here telling for the first time what
became of him and his three companions

  we left the apartment secretly and shot up on the
elevator to the roof on the one hundred and fiftieth
floor where we hired a large taxi-plane and flew south
to our recently purchased estate in the ozark moun-
tains it is really quite a pretentious place although
located in a sparsely inhabited country with its pala-
tial house and spacious grounds all enclosed by a high
wall to insure secrecy my mother and sister were
there at the time-they still are

  in the meadow behind the stables stood a nearly
completed steel rocket an enlarged duplicate of the
one which made the historic trip to venus and return
the new rocket was the one in which the morteshang
scientific and diplomatic mission princess loama
prince vomi and their slave governess were to have
journeyed to venus we had given out no information
about its construction

  in the month that followed while the world won-
dered what had become of us the rocket was com-
pleted and filled with stores for a voyage i watched
the preparations with a heavy heart for i knew it meant
the final departure of my friends

  i couldnt stay on earth any longer les ran de-
clared i could never live down the opinion the pub-
lic has of me on venus i will be an honored scientist
and a personage high in court favor besides i am
in duty bound to return loama and vomi to their
parents

  there was another reason too i had seen ran
and loama on the terrace in the moonlight with her
white arms about his neck and her lips against his
he would indeed be high in the green court i thought
a trifle wistfully

  come with us les ran pleaded but i could only
shake my head heaven knows i wanted to for i
faced the same thing here on earth that he was escap-
ing from but my mother needed my care loama
pleaded with me too her lack of words more than re-
placed by the eloquence of her eyes had things been
different she-oh well i couldnt have gone anyway

  the final day came i accompanied the little party
up into the body of the rocket

  we have parachutes this trip too observed ran
with a smile indicating four bundles at our feet shall
we make them five instead of four

  i shook my head final good-byes were said and
loama gave me the surprise of my life by suddenly
throwing her arms about my neck and kissing me fare-
well it was the only kiss she ever gave me in mem-
ory i can still feel the moist warmth of her lips   

  the elevator carried me down to the ground where
my mother and sister and little group of mechanics
waited to demolish the elevator we moved back a
safe distance the door in the rocket above us closed
my watch registered exactly noon ran wanted no
telescopes to follow him out into space on this trip

  flame suddenly roared down from the firing cham-
ber tearing up the sod and igniting the wood of the
fallen elevator the rocket shot upward leaving a
long trail of fire straight up it rose diminishing rap-
idly to a black speck and then to nothing for a long
time i squinted up at the clear blue sky where it had
vanished

  i sighed and glanced down at the ground a flash
of yellow metal caught my eye it was reflected from
a heavy brooch of virgin gold lying in the grass a
brooch showing a laughing face of a girl carved in pale
green ivory with tall graceful trees like long-handled
feathered fans in the background it lies before me
on my desk as i write this like the invitation of the
goddesses of venus to an earthbound adorer maybe i
shall know them better some day-who can say

  tories about ants are no longer a novelty in fic-
tion scientifiction stories about ants have been writ-
ten before

  but we unhesitatingly state that the present story by
the well-known writer is no doubt the greatest ant story
that has ever been conceived

  the editor of this magazine in a talk with mr verrill
who is not only an author of note but a noted explorer as
well asked him to do a special ant story for this maga-
zine it is interesting to note that practically the entire
story ivas written in the south american jungle during
mr verrills latest expedition

 readers will remember that mr verrill discovered a
neiv race of bearded indians near the peruvian wilds in
south america outside of this mr verrill has for
many years been making a deep study of ants and their
habits and the things that he tells us of them in this
story are not at all exaggerated if you magnify the
usual ant you will have exactly what mr verrill gives
us in this notable document

 few people are interested enough to study a dry
scientific work of ant-life but here we are given the
greatest scientifiction story of ants and the way they
live it is not only a first-class piece of literature but is
a gem from a purely scientific viewpoint also

a metal man

 yjac williamson

fetal man stands in a dark dusty cor-
of the tyburn college museum
who is responsible for the figure be-
loved there or why it was done i do
now to the casual eye it looks to be
merely an ordinary life-size statue the visitor who
gives it a closer view marvels at the minute perfection
of the detail of hair and skin at the silent tragedy
in the set determined expression and poise and at
the remarkable greenish cast of the metal of which it
is composed but most of all at the peculiar mark
upon the chest it is a six-sided blot of a deep crim-
son hue with the surface oddly granular and strange
wavering lines radiating from it-lines of a lighter
shade of red

  of course it is generally known that the metal man
was once professor thomas kelvin of the geology
department there are current many garbled and in-
accurate accounts of the weird disaster that befell him
i believe i am the only one to whom he entrusted his
story it is to put these fantastic tales at rest that i have
decided to publish the narrative that kelvin sent me

  for some years he had been spending his summer
vacations along the pacific coast of mexico prospect-
ing for radium it was three months since he had re-
turned from his last expedition evidently he had been
successful beyond his wildest dreams he did not
come to tyburn but we heard stories of his selling
millions of dollars worth of salts of radium and giving
as much more to institutions employing radium treat-
ment and it was said that
he was sick of a strange dis-
order that defied the worlds
best specialists and that he
was pouring out his millions
in the establishment of
scholarships and endow-
ments as if he expected to
die soon

  one cold stormy day
when the sea was running
high on the unprotected
coast which the cottage overlooks i saw a sail out to
the north it rapidly drew nearer until i could tell
that it was a small sailing schooner with auxiliary
power she was running with the wind but a half mile
offshore she came up into it and the sails were lowered
soon a boat had put off in the direction of the shore
the sea was not so rough as to make the landing haz-
ardous but the proceeding was rather unusual and as
i had nothing better to do i went out in the yard before
my modest house which stands perhaps two hundred
yards above the beach in order to have a better view

  when the boat touched four men sprang out and
rushed it up higher on the sand as a fifth tall man
arose in the stern the four picked up a great chest and
started up in my direction the fifth person followed
leisurely silently and without invitation the men
brought the chest up the beach and into my yard and
set it down in front of the door

  the fifth man whom i now knew to be a hard-faced
yankee skipper walked up to me and said gruffly
i am captain mcandrews

  im glad to meet you captain i said wondering
there must be some mistake i was not expect-
ing-

  not at all he said abruptly the man in that
chest was transferred to my ship from the liner piu-
tonia three days ago he has paid me for my services
and i believe his instructions have been carried out
good day sir

  he turned on his heel and started away

  a man in the chest  i exclaimed

  he walked on unheeding and the seamen followed
i stood and watched them as they walked down to the
boat and rowed back to the schooner i gazed at its
sails until they were lost against the dull blue of the
clouds frankly i feared to open the chest

  at last i nerved myself to do it it was unlocked
i threw back the lid with a shock of uncontrollable
horror that left me half sick for hours i saw in it
stark naked with the strange crimson mark standing
lividly out from the pale green of the breast the metal

man just as you may see
him in the museum

  of course i knew at once
that it was kelvin for a
long time i bent trembling
and staring at him then i
saw an old canteen purple-
stained lying by the head
of the figure and under it
a sheaf of manuscript i
got the latter out walked
with shaken steps to the
easy chair in the house and read the story that follows

fvear russell

 ij you are my best-my only-intimate
friend i have arranged to have my body and this
story brought to you i just drank the last of the
wonderful purple liquid that has kept me alive since i
came back and i have scant time to finish this neces-
sarily brief account of my adventure but my affairs
are in order and i die in peace i had myself trans-
ferred to the schooner to-day in order to reach you

  fot since we published the moon pool has such a
   story as this been published by us

  the metal man contains an abundant matter of mystery
  adventure and for a short story a surprising amount of
  true science

  unless we are very much mistaken this story will be hailed
  with delight by every scientifiction fan we hope mr wil-
  liamson can be induced to write a number of stories in a
  similar vein


tt flre was	as a balloon bright and steady it looked much like a great jet of combustible gas burning as it streamed from the

cylinder y  a whole forest of flames  i stood petrified in amazement wondering vaguely at the what and why of the thing




amazing stories

as soon as could be and to avoid possible complica-
tions i trust captain mcandrews when i left
france i hoped to see you before the end but fate
ruled otherwise

  you know that the goal of my expedition was the
headwaters of el rio de la sangre the river of
blood it is a small stream whose strangely red waters
flow into the pacific on my trip last year i had discov-
ered that its waters were powerfully radioactive water
has the power of absorbing radium emanations and
emitting them in turn and i hoped to find radium-bear-
ing minerals in the bed of the upper river twenty-five
miles above the mouth the river emerges from the
cordilleras there are a few miles of rapids and back
of them the river plunges down a magnificent water-
fall no exploring party had ever been back of the
falls i had hired an indian guide and made a mule-
back journey to their foot at once i saw the futility
of attempting to climb the precipitous escarpment
but the water there was even more powerfully radio-
active than at the mouth there was nothing to do
but return

  this summer i bought a small monoplane though
it was comparatively slow in speed and able to spend
only six hours aloft its light weight and the small
area needed for landing made it the only machine
suitable for use in so rough a country the steamer
left me again on the dock at the little town of vaca
morena with my stack of crates and gasoline tins
after a visit to the alcade i secured the use of an
abandoned shed for a hangar i set about assembling
the plane and in a fortnight i had completed the task
it was a beautiful little machine with a wing spread
of only twenty-five feet

  then one morning i started the engine and made
a trial flight it flew smoothly and in the afternoon i
refilled the tanks and set off for the rio de la sangre
the stream looked like a red snake crawling out to the
sea-there was something serpentine in its aspect fly-
ing high i followed it above the falls and into a region
of towering mountain peaks the river disappeared
beneath a mountain for a moment i thought of land-
ing and then it occurred to me that it flowed subter-
raneously for only a few miles and would reappear
farther inland

  i soared over the cliffs and came over the crater

  a great pool of green fire it was fully ten miles
across to the black ramparts at the farther side the
surface of the green was so smooth that at first i
thought it was a lake and then i knew that it must be
a pool of heavy gas in the glory of the evening sun
the snow-capped summits about were brilliant argent
crowns dyed with crimson tinged with purple and
gold tinted with strange and incredibly beautiful hues
amid this wild scenery nature had placed her greatest
treasure i knew that in the crater i would find the
radium i sought

t circled about the place rapt in wonder as

  x the sun sank lower a light silver mist gathered
on the peaks half veiling their wonders and flowed
toward the crater it seemed drawn with a strange

attraction and then the center of the green lake rose
up in a shining peak it flowed up into a great hill of
emerald fire something was rising in the green-
carrying it up then the vapor flowed back revealing
a strange object still veiled faintly by the green and
silver clouds it was a gigantic sphere of deep red
marked with four huge oval spots of dull back its
surface was smooth metallic and thickly studded with
great spikes that seemed of yellow fire it was a ma-
chine inconceivably great in size it spun slowly as it
rose on a vertical axis moving with a deliberate pur-
poseful motion

  it came up to my own level paused and seemed to
spin faster and the silver mist was drawn to the yel-
low points condensing curdling until the whole globe
was a ball of lambent argent for a moment it hung
unbelievably glorious in the light of the setting sun
and then it sank-ever faster-until it dropped like a
plummet into the sea of green

   and with its fall a sinister darkness descended upon
the desolate wilderness of the peaks and i was seized
by a fear that had been deadened by amazement and
realized that i had scant time to reach vaca morena
before complete darkness fell immediately i put the
plane about in the direction of the tpwn according
to my recollections i had at the time no very definite
idea of what it was i had seen or whether the weird
exhibition had been caused by human or natural agen-
cies i remember thinking that in such enormous quan-
tities as undoubtedly the crater contained it radium
might possess qualities unnoticed in small amounts or
again that there might be present radioactive minerals
at present unknown it occurred to me also that per-
haps some other scientists had already discovered the
deposits and that what i had witnessed had been the
trial of an airship in which radium was utilized as a
propellent i was considerably shaken but not much
alarmed what happened later would have seemed
incredible to me then

  and then i noticed that a pale bluish luminosity
was gathering about the cowl of the cockpit and in a
moment i saw that the whole machine and even my
own person was covered with it it was somewhat like
st elmos fire except that it covered all surfaces in-
discriminately instead of being restricted to sharp
points all at once i connected the phenomenon with
the thing i had seen i felt no physical discomfort
and the motor continued to run but as the blue radi-
ance continued to increase i observed that my body
felt heavier and that the machine was being drawn
downward my mind was flooded with wonder and
terror i fought to retain sufficient self-possession to
fly the ship my arms were soon so heavy that i could
hold them upon the controls only with difficulty and
i felt a slight dizziness due no doubt to the bloods
being drawn from my head when i recovered i was
already almost upon the green somehow my gravi-
tation had been increased and i was being drawn into
the pit it was possible to keep the plane under con-
trol only by diving and keeping at a high speed

  i plunged into the green pool the gas was not
suffocating as i had anticipated in fact i noticed no
the metal man



change in the atmosphere save that my vision was
limited to a few yards around the wings of the plane
were still distinctly discernible suddenly a smooth
sandy plain was murkily revealed below and i was able
to level the ship off enough for a safe landing as
i came to a stop i saw that the sand was slightly lu-
minous as the green mist seemed to be and red for
a time i was confined to the ship by my own weight
but i noticed that the blue was slowly dissipating and
with it its effect

  as soon as i was able i clambered over the side
of the cockpit carrying my canteen and automatic
which were themselves immensely heavy i was un-
able to stand erect but i crawled off over the coarse
shining red sand stopping at frequent intervals to lie
flat and rest i was in deathly fear of the force that
had brought me down i was sure it had been directed
by intelligence the floor was so smooth and level that
i supposed it to be the bottom of an ancient lake

  sometimes i looked fearfully back and when i
was a hundred yards away i saw a score of lights float-
ing through the green toward the airplane in the
luminous murk each bright point was surrounded by a
disc of paler blue i made no movement but lay and
watched them they floated to the plane and wheeled
about it with a slow heavy motion closer and lower
they came until they reached the ground about it the
mist was so thick as to obscure the details of the scene

  when i went to resume my flight i found my ex-
cess of gravity almost entirely gone though i went on
hands and knees for another hundred yards to escape
possible observation when i got to my feet the plane
was lost to view i walked on for perhaps a quarter of
a mile and suddenly realized that my sense of direction
was altogether gone i was completely lost in a strange
world inhabited by beings whose nature and disposition
i could not even guess and then i realized that it
was the height of folly to walk about when any step
might precipitate me into a danger of which i could
know nothing i had a peculiarly unpleasant feeling
of helpless fear

  the luminous red sand and the shining green of the
air lay about in all directions unbroken by a single solid
object there was no life no sound no motion the
air hung heavy and stagnant the flat sand was like
the surface of a dead and desolate sea i felt the panic
of utter isolation from humanity the mist seemed
to come closer the strange evil in it seemed to grow
more alert

uddenly a darting light passed meteor-like
through the green above and in my alarm i ran
a few blundering steps my foot struck a light
object that rang like metal the sharpness of the con-
cussion filled me with fear but in an instant the light
was gone i bent down to see what i had kicked

  it was a metal bird-an eagle formed of metal-
with the wings outspread the talons gripping the fierce
beak set open the color was white tinged with green
it weighed no more than the living bird at first i
thought it was a cast model and then i saw that each
feather was complete and flexible somehow a real

eagle had been turned to metal it seemed incredible
yet here was the concrete proof i wondered if the
radium deposits which i had already used to explain
so much might account for this too i knew that
science held transmutation of elements to be possible-
had even accomplished it in a limited way and that
radium itself was the product of the disintegration of
ionium and ionium that of uranium

  i was struck with fright for my own safety might
i be changed to metal i looked to see if there were
other metal things about and i found them in abun-
dance half-buried in the glowing sands were metal
birds of every kind-birds that had flown over the sur-
rounding cliffs and at the climax of my search i
found a pterosant-a flying reptile that had invaded
the pit in ages past-changed to ageless metal its
wingspread was fully fifteen feet-it would be a treas-
ure in any museum

  i made a fearful examination of myself and to
my unutterable horror i perceived that the tips of my
finger nails and the fine hairs upon my hands were
already changed to light green metal the shock un-
nerved me completely you cannot conceive my horror
i screamed aloud in agony of soul careless of the ter-
rible foes that the sound might attract i ran off
wildly i was -blind unreasoning i felt no fatigue
as i ran only stark terror

  bright swift-moving lights passed above in the
green but i heeded them not suddenly i came upon
the great sphere that i had seen above it rested mo-
tionless in a cradle of black metal the yellow fire
was gone from the spikes but the red surface shone
with a metallic luster lights floated about it they
made little bright spots in the green like lanterns swing-
ing in a fog i turned and ran again desperately i
took no note of direction nor of the passage of time

  then i came upon a bank of violet vegetation
waist-deep it was grass-like with thick narrow leaves
dotted with clusters of small pink blooms and little
purple berries and a score of yards beyond i saw a
sluggish red stream-el rio de la sangre here was
cover at last i threw myself down in the violet growth
and lay sobbing with fatigue and terror for a long
time i was unable to stir or think when i looked
again at my finger nails the tips of metal had doubled
in width

  i tried to control my agitation and to think pos-
sibly the lights whatever they were would sleep by
day if i could find the plane or scale the walls i
might escape the fearful action of the radioactive min-
erals before it was too late i realized that i was
hungry i plucked off a few of the purple berries and
tasted them they had a salty metallic taste and i
thought they would be valueless for food but in
pulling them i had inadvertently squeezed the juice
from one upon my fingers and when i wiped it off i
saw to my amazement and my inexpressible joy that
the rim of metal was gone from the finger nails it had
touched i had discovered a means of safety i sup-
pose that the plants were able to exist there only be-
cause they had been so developed that they produced
compounds counteracting the metal-forming emana-


amazing stories

tions probably their evolution began when the action
was far weaker than now and only those able to with-
stand the more intense radiations had survived i lost
no time in eating a cluster of the berries and then i
poured the water from my canteen and filled it with
their juice i have analysed the fluid and it corresponds
in some ways with the standard formulas for the neu-
tralization of radium burns and doubtless it saved me
from the terrible burns caused by the action of ordinary
radium

t lay there until dawn dozing a little at times
a only to start into wakefulness without cause it
seemed that some daylight filtered through the green
for at dawn it grew paler and even the red sand ap-
peared less luminous after eating a few more of the
berries i ascertained the direction in which the stag-
nant red water was moving and set off down-stream
toward the west in order to get an idea of where i
was going i counted my paces i had walked about
two and a half miles along by the violet plants when
i came to an abrupt cliff it towered up until it was
lost in the green gloom it seemed to be mostly of
black pitchblende the barrier seemed absolutely un-
scalable the red river plunged out of sight by the
cliff in a racing whirlpool

  i walked off north around the rim i had no very
definite plan except to try to find a way out over the
cliffs if i failed in that it would be time to hunt the
plane i had a mortal fear of going near it or of
encountering the strange lights i had seen floating
about it as i went i saw none of them i suppose
they slept when it was day

  i went on until it must have been noon though my
watch had stopped occasionally i passed metal trees
that had fallen from above and once the metallic body
of a bear that had slipped off a path above some time
in past ages and there were metal birds without num-
ber they must have been accumulating through geo-
logical ages all along up to this the cliff had risen
perpendicularly to the limit of my vision but now i
saw a wide ledge with a sloping wall beyond it dimly
visible above but the sheer wall rose a full hundred
feet to the shelf and i cursed at my inability to sur-
mount it for a time i stood there devising imprac-
tical means for climbing it driven almost to tears by
my impotence i was ravenously hungry and thirsty
as well

  at last i went on

  in an hour i came upon it a slender cylinder of
black metal that towered a hundred feet into the
greenish mist and carried at the top a great mush-
room-shaped orange flame it was a strange thing
the fire was as big as a balloon bright and steady it
looked much like a great jet of combustible gas burning
as it streamed from the cylinder i stood petrified in
amazement wondering vaguely at the what and why
of the thing

  and then i saw more of them back of it dimly-
scores of them-a whole forest of flames

  i crouched back against the cliff while i considered
here i supposed was the city of the lights they were

sleeping now but still i had not the courage to enter
according to my calculations i had gone about fifteen
miles then i must be i thought almost diametrically
opposite the place where the crimson river flowed under
the wall with half of the rim unexplored if i wished
to continue my journey i must go around the city if
i may call it that

  so i left the wall soon it was lost to view i tried
to keep in view of the orange flames but abruptly they
were gone in the mist i walked more to the left but
i came upon nothing but the wastes of red sand with
the green murk above on and on i wandered then
the sand and the air grew slowly brighter and i knew
that night had fallen the lights were soon passing to
and fro i had seen lights the night before but they
traveled high and fast these on the other hand
sailed low and i felt that they were searching 

  i knew that they were hunting for me i lay down
in a little hollow in the sand vague mist-veiled points
of light came near and passed and then one stopped
directly overhead it descended and the circle of radi-
ance grew about it i knew that it was useless to run
and i could not have done so for my terror down
and down it came

 a nd then i saw its form the thing was of a glit-

  il tering blazing crystal a great-six-sided up-
right prism of red a dozen feet in length it was with
a six-pointed structure like a snowflake about the cen-
ter deep blue with pointed blue flanges running from
the points of the star to angles of the prism soft
scarlet fire flowed from the points and on each face
of the prism above and below the star was a purple
cone that must have been an eye strange pulsating
lights flickered in the crystal it was alive with light

  it fell straight toward me

  it was a terribly utterly alien form of life it
was not human not animal-not even life as we know
it at all and yet it had intelligence but it was strange
and foreign and devoid of feeling it is curious to say
that even then as i lay beneath it the thought came to
me that the thing and its fellows must have crystallized
when the waters of the ancient sea dried out of the
crater crystallizing salts take intricate forms

  i drew my automatic and fired three times but the
bullets ricocheted harmlessly off the polished facets

  it dropped until the gleaming lower point of the
prism was not a yard above me then the scarlet fire
reached out caressingly-flowed over my body my
weight grew less i was lifted held against the point
you may see its mark upon my chest the thing
floated into the air carrying me soon others were
drifting about i was overcome with nausea the
scene grew black and i knew no more

  i awoke floating free in a brilliant orange light i
touched no solid object i writhed kicked about-at
nothingness i could not move or turn over because i
could get a hold on nothing my memory of the last
two days seemed a nightmare my clothing was still
upon me my canteen still hung or rather floated by
my shoulder and my automatic was in my pocket i
had the sensation that a great space of time had passed
the metal man



there was a curious stiffness in my side i examined
it and found a red scar i believe those crystal things
had cut into me and i found with a horror you
cannot understand the mark upon my chest presently
it dawned upon me that i was floating devoid of grav-
ity and free as an object in space in the orange flame at
the top of one of the black cylinders the crystals
knew the secret of gravity it was vital to them and
peering about i discerned with infinite repulsion a
great flashing body a few yards away but its inner
lights were dead so i knew that it was day and that the
strange beings were sleeping

tf i was ever to escape this was the opportunity i

  a kicked clawed desperately at the air all in vain i
did not move an inch if they had chained me i could
not have been more secure i drew my automatic re-
solved on a desperate measure they would not find me
again alive and as i had it in my hand an idea came
into my mind i pointed the gun to the side and fired
six rapid shots and the recoil of each explosion sent
me drifting faster rocket-wise toward the edge

  i shot out into the green had my gravity been
suddenly restored i might have been killed by the
fall but i descended slowly and felt a curious light-
ness for several minutes and to my surprise when
i struck the ground the airplane was right before me
they had drawn it up by the base of the tower it
seemed to be intact i started the engine with nervous

haste and sprang into the cockpit as i started an-
other black tower loomed up abruptly before me but i
veered around it and took off in safety

  in a few moments i was above the green i half
expected the gravitational wave to be turned on me
again but higher and higher i rose unhindered until
the accursed black walls were about me no longer
the sun blazed high in the heavens soon i had landed
again at vaca morena

  i had had enough of radium hunting on the
beach where i landed i sold the plane to a rancher at
his own price and told him to reserve a place for me
on the next steamer which was due in three days
then i went to the towns single inn ate and went to
bed at noon the next day when i got up i found that
my shoes and the pockets of my clothes contained a good
bit of the red sand from the crater that had been col-
lected as i crawled about in flight from the crystal
lights i saved some of it for curiosity alone but when
i analysed it i found it a radium compound so rich that
the little handful was worth millions of dollars

  but the fortune was of little value for despite fre-
quent doses of the fluid from my canteen and the best
medical aid i have suffered continually and now that
my canteen is empty i am doomed

                   what went before

  ttt then the first news began to dribble in from south
 america about curious beings short and broad with
r r pasty faces who manned strange airplanes that
could rise and fall vertically and were equipped with some sort
of gun ivhich discharged a shell capable of emitting a cloud
of poisonous gas the head of the new york scoop sent two
of his best reporters max harding and dick martin to the
scene of the invasion

  when they arrive at rio-alone because their boat turns
back frightened-they find that the strange invaders had pre-
ceded them there and left their mark

 there is nothing they could do in rio so they decide to
get a steamer for somewhere else when they arrive at the
wharf on the parahyba river they find that the steamer full
to overflowing is further deterred from departing on account
of the frantic mob at the wharf harding and martin pushing
through the crowd find miss rita courtney a fellow reporter
also on the job they all manage to board the steamer just
before she pulls out but overloaded with her human cargo
she soon runs into a mndbank and wedges herself fast there

  just above them they see the invading plane trailing a kind
of coarse meshed drag-net in this net the enemy bags the
panic stricken crowds like fish and brings them up to the
cage which hangs loosely beneath their aerial vessel the three
neivspaper people are among the last batch the plane con-
tinues southward and then descends deep into the crust of the
earth into a subterranean land-the land of the troglodytes

  there they find many white people of the upper world among
them john rixon old-time friend of rita courtney who has
assumed leadership among the upper world people enslaved
there they learn that the trogs are capturing more and more
people for the purpose of working their radium mines for
which they require exhaustless numbers on account of the short
duration of life caused by mining radium

  after a short time due to ritas inspiration they learn a
little of the troggese language and because they seem some-
what superior to the rest of the captives they are not sent
to the mines chemically these trogs were in advance of
the upper world

  after a short imprisonment for dick and max harding
during which time rita and john rixon are busy making a
parachute plans are made for the getaivay of at least three
of the group-harding because he thinks that he had about
completed a short-length wave which will cause nerve paralysis
-rita and dick martin john rixon stays behind for the
sake of the prisoners

  their opportunity for escape comes very shortly taking
their hand-made parachute with them the three friends hide
as stowaways in a plane that is going up for more victims
after they shoot tip through the crater one of the trogs
searching for something catches dick moving the parachute
toward more safety and sends him back to the hole for further
imprisonment-the parachute with him but rita in her usual
resourceful manner with the help of harding makes another
chute from as much of her clothing and hardings as they could
spare they get their chance to escape while they are sailing
over sydney their conveyance is barely able to withstand the
strain of the two bodies but they land safely on the roof of
a big department store they replenish their wardrobe from
what is left of the stock in the looted store for the trogs have
been at work in sydney too

  in this nezv city of the dead they meet mr jonas t hopkins
who helps them on their way to america and a laboratory in
which harding has the means for saving the world against
this terrible enemy their plane breaks down near the canal
and they start off toward alexandria and port said where they
hope to get a steamer for new york

the battle of gibraltar

 he screw stopped the steamer came to a
standstill

  i darent go any nearer said the cap-
tain my god ive heard about these
brutes but i only half believed in them
came out of the inside of
the earth did they when
i was a nipper they taught
me that hell was down
there

  to have come so far
and to be stuck here-its
maddening cried rita

to have risked so many
forlorn hopes had such
wonderful good fortune

and now its cruel
cruel

 f the preceding chapters of the world at bay com-
 manded your attention the final chapters will prove to be
 even more absorbing and more exciting

    the troglodytes are fighting the whole world and the
 world indeed is at bay who will win and how it will all
 happen are questions that hold the worlds attention and
 after even the troglodytes or the human race win a decisive
 victory what then it is evident that neither of the two
 races can be vanquished completely

    you will follow the adventures of our heroes with bated
 breath and you will remember the story long for one of the
 best of this kind ever published

   dont think we shall be held up long miss court-
ney said hopkins wind rising-east wind too
which is generally pretty dangerous hereabouts there
she goes ysee

   as the gale swept over us bringing clouds of fine
sand with it we had to get below and swelter under
cover till the worst was past but when we ventured

 out again we saw that

the sudden gale had blown
away the poison-gas

  i need not harrow your
feelings by a description of
what we found when we
entered the zone of silent
death it was rio over
again

   we got through reached
alexandria found some
shipping that had escaped
the gas and immediately


the fate of the whole civilized world hung in the balance a few moments would decide either my etheric discharges would dis-
integrate the molecules of that poisonous vapor into harmless atoms or the cloud would roll on and on would envelope us    ard
make the people of the underworld lords of the upper air as well




amazing stories

took fast passage for home on the destroyer wildfire

  her commander endeavoured to get us an airplane
but his radio appeal did not reach any immediately
available pilots most vessels were actually flying at
the moment the aerodrome and hangars at port
said lay silent as did the wireless station the poison-
gas had put them out of action

  we were too restless too anxious to wait the
wildfire would have to serve

  as the destroyer forged her way through the
mediterranean at top speed we learned much more
of the doings of the troglodytes and the panics that
everywhere followed their appearance it was dismal
news but the captain of hms wildfire did not
seem at all downhearted

  it is only a question of time he declared the
beggars havent come up against our latest equipment
yet wait till they try and cross over near gib as
they seem likely to do theyve tried to find a camping-
place in the pyrenees-wiped out a mountain village
or two-and are expected to move across from the
atlas in force we are going to let them come but
we shall give them a warm reception en route i only
hope we get there in time to see the fireworks

  we hadnt the heart to voice our doubt but we
remembered-at least i did-the confident brazilian
gunners who lay dead on the hill slopes back of rio
de janeiro

  and that brings me to mention one item of news
that had most important results later i learned that
dick and i were supposed to be dead our one and
only message to the scoop had been duly received
a further message from rio sent after the catastrophe
by an eye-witness of the battle stated that we were
among the victims

  it was also very interesting to have this statement
tapped out

  it appears that one of the hostile air-vessels from
the underworld to accept mr hardings story has
reached india a message from native sources states
that near the village of roo-poona peshawar a great
monster fell to earth in the early morning and gave out
a thick vapour that killed every living thing in the
valley when people ventured to the spot later in the
day they found fragments of a strange metallic ma-
chine and the mangled remains of some hideous devils
in the ruins of the village temple this must be the
runaway vessel from which mr harding and miss
courtney made their daring parachute descent into
sydney

  i guess you two will be the big noise when you
hit home was mr hopkins remark folks wont
take much convincing that youve handed out gospel
truth and if and when you deliver the goods in the
shape of licking the trogs-all i can say is dont
forget me

  if we get home we are not there yet said i
look yonder

  we had just reached gibraltar and had steamed
under the shelter of the frowning batteries of the
rock a long line of troglodyte airplanes was swoop-
ing towards us from the african coast and from the

summit of the rock and from the spanish mainland
came europes aerial navy to do battle with the foe

  just in time after all cried our captain i was
afraid we should be too late now i can lend a hand
im sorry to disappoint you captain said i but
for the time being you are at our service i think
that is the purport of your order from the admiralty
yesterday well that being so you will stay here at
your own peril if you fire one gun or one is fired
from the rock they will just smother us all in a sea-
of poison let us get into the atlantic and steam for
home we shall see a lot of the fight through our
glasses im sorry but i must reach america how-
ever this battle goes the world will be at their mercy
unless i can perfect my method of fighting the trogs
with their own weapons

  after a little hesitation the captain bowed to the
inevitable greatly against his own wishes and to the
utter disgust of all the officers and men the wildfire
stood out into the western ocean her nose to the north

  every man who could be spared from actual duty
was on deck it was a clear calm day and we had
a splendid view of the first great battle in the air
there were at least three times as many europeans
as troglodytes but against such strange foes as these
our airmen had to learn the rudiments of battle on
the spot

  the trogs appeared to hesitate at first never having
met such a display of resistance before stopped and
for a time hovered motionless consulting

  the europeans rushed to the attack we were -
near enough to see the bright flashes from the machine
guns to hear the rattle of their discharges then
came a greater flash and the heavy booming roar
of the great -ton gun on the rock itself

  the all-fired fools shouted hopkins stamping
up and down in sheer helpless rage they are just
asking the trogs to annihilate the lot they might
have let the rock alone if the fools had kept quiet
close on his heated words came the second report
of the gun and the leading trog vessel vanished in
a burst of flame but before the crew of the wildfire
had stopped cheering came the to us familiar pop
of the troglodyte guns and immediately afterwards
a cloud of smoky haze was seen to unfold upon and
around the famous fortress

  one burst of shell-fire came from its batteries-and
only one then the sinking cloud of gas hid it from
view penetrated the many galleries and smote it into
silence the rock had become a mausoleum

  and the sooner we get away from here the better
ill be pleased said our friend grinding his teeth
the neighbourhood isnt healthy

  the issue of the battle was all too evident the
trog vessels driven by their powerful radium engines
and able to rise and fall at will were quickly masters
of the situation their speed and activity baffled our
gunfire and their fatal poison bombs shot forth in
prodigal profusion enwrapped the rock the harbour
town the shipping and many of our slower air-craft
in a billowy cloud of death

  after vainly endeavouring to rise above the soaring
the world at bay



trogs to hit them on the move or even to ram them
the european vessels were either driven off or lost
in the gas cloud their very method of attack by
mass formation was their chief undoing in mass
formation they were caught in the cloud and with
their crews dead or dying only escaped from it to
crash aimlessly to earth or sea

  is the wildfire doing her best captain asked rita
cant you get a bit more speed out of her we must
get home the trogs have beaten us and the way
to europe is open to them a few hours flight may
see them over london itself

a disastrous home-coming

tt te are doing our very best miss courtney
 was the captains reply we are going all
  out i only hope some of those fiends wont
be attracted by our smoke rotten smudgy stuff we
picked up at port said but they are sending us all
the help they can-submarines cruisers and hydroplane
carriers will be on the lookout for us

  i hope they get to us in time growled hopkins
glass to eye some of the galoots are hiking it back
to africa and one seems to be coming our way i
guess they used up a fair dose of their poison-must
have liberated some cubic furlongs of the stuff-and
are going back for more yes this chap is after us
if they would only drop a little lower we could
soon settle the matter said the captain im going
to fight to the last the men are ready at the guns
and one good shell will be enough if it comes to
the worst the steam pinnace is alongside and you
must try to save yourselves

  we had better get aboard then said rita decisively
when the captain left us we might in the small
boat be overlooked they will have no idea of our
importance fortunately

  the trog vessel was gaining fast upon the ship as
we climbed down the ladder and set our little craft
going but as the enemy plane gained she rose steadily
they had evidently learned that warships were really
dangerous foes

  why this particular vessel should have followed us
except out of a sheer lust for slaughter we shall of
course never know

  we had put nearly half a mile between ourselves and
the destroyer when the duel began a veritable tor-
rent of metal from the wildfire roared and screamed
into the sky but fell short of the upward-leaping trog
-or so we thought then came the first trog bomb

  the gas-cloud quickly curled round the ship but
she drove clear of it as she emerged another bomb
fell and as she moved out of the second cloud she met
a third and now though she still moved her guns
were silent the insidious poison had penetrated all
her ports had entered all her ventilating ways a ship
of the dead she still moved on trailing the clinging
cloud in her wake

  and then to our intense surprise the trog vessel
began to fall slowly at first then with increasing
speed and under the impulse of her horizontal screws
and the rising gale in a slanting downward swoop

  shes falling she was hit after all cried i
glory be

  but shes heading this way and looks like dropping
plumb on us if we arent quick shouted hopkins
crowd her along sonny

  the naval engineer crowded her along it was a
race between our boat and the falling troglodyte ves-
sel out of all that wide expanse of water the force
of gravity must bring them down upon us

  we cleared ourselves from the impact of the hurtling
airplane by about a couple of fathoms as she struck
the water we had a swift glimpse of her frantic gro-
tesque crew they were grunting and screaming in
fright climbing to the highest parts of the upper deck

  the impact broke the vessel to pieces nearly all of
which with their living freight sank at once but one
large section of the rear wing remained afloat and
upon this sprawled a troglodyte the floating wing
drifted towards us touched the pinnace

  what happened happened so quickly that it will
probably take me a longer time to write of it than
the event itself needed for its occurrence

  the pasty-faced creature his dark goggles lost was
peering at us through nearly closed eyes in his trem-
bling hands he clutched a flame pistol trying to level
it upon our boat

  hopkins and i sprang forward together but i was
just a shade the swifter i seized rita roughly and
dragged her down to the bottom of the pinnace

  it was so near a thing that i felt the scorching heat
of the flame upon my back and a great hole in the
boats side was eaten away by the fierce atomic energy
of the discharge a crack came from the engineers
revolver a splash in the water threw spray over us
and when we rose to our feet there was no sign visible
of our enemies or the fragments of their craft

  the water was now lapping in at the hole in the
side which all our efforts failed to plug and only by
ceaseless baling could we escape foundering

  it was a backaching task and very glad we all were
when a couple of hours later a naval hydroplane picked
us up we reached portsmouth at sunset a special
plane rushed us to croydon and there we were met
by a vast crowd we had scarcely set foot to ground
when my head-the chief of the daily scoop-forced
his way to the front and seized me in both hands

  had to come-got across on a submarine-simply
had to see you if only for a few minutes--you know
youre to stay here-our people have loaned you-

  what i shouted wrathfully incredulous but it
was true we had been loaned as though we were
national heirlooms we were no longer free citizens
of a mighty nation-we now belonged to the whole
human race and were easily the most important per-
sons in the world and wherever lay the greater need
there we must go

although our own country had by no means
 escaped unscathed yet our hurt was as nothing
compared to the damage that had been wrought upon
the teeming myriads of europe there could be no
question but that it was policy to strike the first blow


amazing stories

where the very concentration of the enemy would work
against them moreover until by experiment i had
perfected my discovery and divulged the formula to
science it was deemed much too risky to expose my
person to the perils of such a passage

  youre famous my boy he continued car
waiting to rush you up to the downing street bunch-
special cabinet meeting all the big-wigs there if you
can only work this anti-gas stunt youve hinted at

  did you look after the apparatus and papers in my
rooms  i interrupted i wirelessed from wellington
about the stuff-you havent let edgar get them i
queried anxiously edgar is my brother snd a more
careless young cub i have yet to meet

  he had them harding but the government rounded
up all your stuff to the last cigarette-got machinists
to duplicate the bits and took photostats of the mss
in case of accident ive got the originals with me
he assured me with much pride

  good old u s i exclaimed thankfully

  we had a long and wearying time at downing street
with a number of military naval and air experts

  i would rather not repeat the flattering things that
were said nor dwell on the details a large cheque for
expenses use of government workshops and the best
technical skill were placed at our disposal

  thereafter ensued forty-eight hours of the most
intense mental concentration and physical strain pos-
sible for the human frame to endure

  every minute of this period was passed in the great
woolwich workshops i had sole control of every
resource and every man in that immense area

  never once were my clothes removed i slept in
snatches anywhere i ate in snatches

  and finally it was accomplished

  a machine for projecting the gas-dispersal rays was
built on the lines of my original drawings it resembled
a short squat wire-wound gun mounted on swivel-
bearings i cant go into the technical exposition here
suffice it to say that the current from the motor driven
dynamo fed into the coils of wire produced an intense
magnetic field in the gun from which the strange
flickering rays shot out

  it looked more like one of the spark producers on
a trog vessel than i would have believed possible it
sent out an intermittent stream of sparkling rays as
long as a current was passed through it we could
not of course as yet test it on the actual poison gas
but i had little doubt of its efficiency

  fagged as i was i sought rita

  you wont have long to wait for a test she ex-
claimed as i concluded my report the trogs have
established a camp within fifty miles of paris and an
attack is believed to be imminent the french govern-
ment i have just learned has asked ours to send you
across with your machine official request from the
war office coming along any moment

  is that all

  no ive lots more news-too much in fact our
story is all over the world we shall lie able to make
tons of money writing more american towns wiped
out i wanted to urge something-something ive

mentioned before-but it will have to wait oh i feel
as if this were all a nightmare as if the world were
spinning round inside my head

  i felt somewhat like that myself all the long days
of perilous adventure seemed to have led us up to a
climax of suspense that was going to test our strength
more than everything that had tested us before if
i hadnt been absolutely worn out physically and men-
tally i should never have slept a wink that night

  but sleep i did awaking refreshed for the next task
-for the supreme ordeal

  i was ordered to take the sparking gun over to paris

  we rushed down to dover by motor ran aboard a
waiting boat and made a record crossing to calais
the french roads were cleared of traffic for us and
we reached the french capital in time and only just
in time to take part in the now historic defence

  the french officials were almost hysterical in their
anxiety and wild hope four troglodyte vessels were
already at work firing poison bombs at such of the
great forts round the city as had too recklessly betrayed
their positions

  our guns are splendid and so are our airmen
cried one of our informants but it is so difficult
to get the range of the trogs when they jump so fast
and so high ah cicl messieurs if you can only
dissipate their deadly smoke

  the air shook with the discharge of guns and the
concussion of bursting shells out of the dusty suburbs
we dashed into the city endeavoring to meet the two
trog vessels that also came inwards

  half-way down the bois de boulogne we saw the
edge of the first gas cloud we pulled up only just
in time fixed on our masks and started up the dynamo

  the test had come the great experiment was on

  as i swung the strange gun to and fro a stream of
intermittent crackling sparks widening out in ghostly
violet waves of faint light shot from its muzzle into
the heart of the advancing cloud would it dispel
the poisonous gas would it disperse that cloud

the victory of paris

the fate of the whole civilized world hung in
the balance a few moments would decide
either my etheric discharges would disintegrate
the molecules of that poisonous vapor into harmless
atoms or the cloud would roll on and on would en-
velope us would shrivel us to skin and bone leave us
corpses in a city of corpses and make the people of the
underworld lords of the upper air as well

  a few moments of strained anxiety such as i pray
never to experience again and then i knew

  it was a success the crackling flashes of ghostly
radiance were dispelling destroying the deadly cloud
as i turned the gun about as though laying dust with
a jet or spray the masses of vapor thinned and van-
ished-thinned and disappeared even more rapidly more
wonderfully than under the influence of the troglo-
dytes own apparatus

  i had won

  the sudden relief the realization of success and all
the world at bay



it would mean was a joy too intense too great to bear

  the frenchmen laughed and wept and in the trans-
ports of their delight they hugged and kissed me

  this is the beginning only max said rita re-
covering her sanity and dabbing her shining eyes we
have not done with the trogs yet here are some
more shells

  the two air-vessels descending perilously low for
them no doubt to see what had become of their gas-
cloud discharged more bombs at us they burst within
a few feet of us and i instantly turned the gun on
them a few seconds of the sparkling light and the
incipient clouds were destroyed almost before they had
begun to be

  our french friends had seized their opportunity
also and from anti-air-craft guns mounted on armored
cars had opened fire on the trogs both vessels were
riddled with shrapnel and crashed to earth

   an urgent telephone call hurried us next to st ger-
main where the other two vessels had begun their fell
work the same tactics again succeeded i dispersed
the gas the ships came down to investigate the french
gunners saw to the rest paris breathed again

  you can imagine for yourself the rejoicings in the
gay city that day and night-the world-wide thanks-
giving that went up as the news was flashed from land
to land by cable and radio

   rita and myself were the guests of the president at
a state banquet where we were toasted flattered and
decorated with the insignia of the legion of honor
it was all in the daily papers we were glad when it
was over and they let us go back to our hotel

  the following morning as rita and i were break-
fasting in a little sitting-room they had set aside for
us in the hotel came news that somewhat damped the
ardor of yesterdays rejoicing

  ive been up at least two hours before you old
sleepy-head said rita and ive been busy let me
tell you while we eat

  the trogs have become active at home raiding
towns and collecting many prisoners but what is
worse they appear to have sensed where the centre of
population and government really is and a machine
has just been reported off long island

  good lord i exclaimed whats to be done
you-we-are going to make copies of the specifi-
cations of your machine my dear max government
orders of course the government couldnt wait to
discuss terms-theyve simply commandeered your in-
vention your services and mine as soon as hopkins
can get his set of blue prints he will be sent across in
the r i think we can trust the american engineers
to do their part directly when he lands

  exactly how do we stand now miss rita court-
ney i asked im a big man you know what
authority did you give for your-er-activities

  a big man such as yourself she said with a sly
twinkle in her eyes cannot be bothered with every
detail of the business of saving a world he must have
help-efficient help i told them i was your private
and confidential secretary

  precisely its an ideal arrangement no doubt

dont great men frequently marry their secretaries
mr harding-she spoke severely-theres a lot
of work to be done yet we have no time to discuss
things of that sort you will accept the situation i
am sure and now there is another step i wish to
take but this i could not take on my own

  yes i had a faint premonition of what was
coming yes 

  its something ive mentioned before its some-
thing that should be our very next move

  ah i had expected it feared it

the quarrel

 t r hardings confidential secretary thinks
  that his next task should be-what i
a asked

  you know very well what i mean-dont be stupid
you know that we ought to make an effort to rescue
some of the prisoners-to seize the outlet

  some of the prisoners of course i should like to
see dick again-and john especially john been
better if he had come with us when he had the chance
then you wouldnt have this bee in your bonnet

  it was rotten of me to display my jealousy like this
i felt that myself even as i spoke it was as though
something not myself making for-unrighteousness
had spoken through me

  what a strange and complex thing is human con-
sciousness  what makes us at times even against our
better will say things that we know will hurt those
we love

  rita drew herself up haughtily pushed her cup and
saucer away

  i think the buzzing you hear is inside your own
head mr harding you dont at all understand or
else you are wilfully blind-or else i am im begin-
ning to wonder    but we are wasting time we
must make an effort to save john and dick and as many
of the other prisoners as we can

  and you propose to set about it how

  we are making specifications of your machine for
our government when that work is done we must
ask for an airship and a convoy of planes to take
us to the outlet a sudden attack there might be
successful we might capture one of their vessels and
go down in it we are proof against their poison now

  you would go down there again if it proved
possible 

  if rita courtney thought as much of john rixon
as all that then my hope was vain indeed it was a
bitter pill a bitter blow to my pride

  to save him even to try to save him she was ready
to risk both my life and her own

  you will go too max i know you will when you
have thought it over only we two know where the
outlet is only we two can talk to the trogs

  i suppose you have some idea of how we are to
capture a vessel of theirs how we are to work one if
we get it and what we are to do when we reach the
bottom of the great shaft we are not afraid of the
gas but what about their nerve-paralyzing ray and
their flame pistols how are we to fight those it


amazing stories

seems to me a mad idea-sheer senseless madness
to you no doubt mr harding to me it seems
ordinary humanity at any rate in my evidently thank-
less position as a big government officials confidential
secretary i have put out the idea to the press the
worlds newspapers will be lauding your chivalrous
heroism to the skies to-night such a nice halo for
you and you dont want to wear it

  really miss courtney said i struggling to keep
my indignation within reasonable bounds this is too
much to expect me to-to-to-er-accept you ask me to
do something i dont see the wisdom of doing and then
coolly tell me that you have already committed me to
it you have got me into a nice mess i cant very
well go back on what you have given out as my own
idea i can hardly give you the sack we cant afford
in our present notorious position to indulge in a public
quarrel really its-er-a bit too thick

  rather lame reasoning i admit but my nerves were
all jangled and the gnawing of my insensate jealousy
goaded me on

  not indulge in a public quarrel of course not
but our present position does not prevent you trying
to provoke a private quarrel with me mr harding
you are actually shouting scowling growing red in
the face i hope the waiters dont notice anything if
you go on like this i am afraid i shall have to give
you notice the position will be too trying

  as soon as you please i snapped suddenly after
all our being thrown together in this affair was purely
accidental

  at that moment i was really sincere i knew that
it would be far better for my peace of mind now that
it was evident rita was not for me to see less of her
to be less with her

  the expression that darkened her eyes was in-
describable

  you will not understand she cried angrily if you
say that again i shall take you at your word i shall
think that you want to get rid of me

  no let us be calm and sane i still feel that my
idea is the right one-that quite apart from our duty
to the prisoners in the underworld it is our best policy
to attack the trogs at home to seize and hold the
outlet i shall be very much astonished if europes
general council-didnt i tell you the various govern-
ments had agreed late last night to drop their silly
isolation and act together under one command-does
not agree with me you can oppose the idea throw
difficulties in the way later if you like but dont talk
to the council as youve talked to me

  i was piqued sore insanely bitter and wracked by
jealousy somewhere inside me a voice was saying
that rita was right that if i loved her i would rise
above my own miserable personal irritation and
yet i would not let that inner voice speak

  a bitter gibe an unworthy taunt was on my tongue
i might have said something that would have alienated
us for ever but at that very moment a page-boy ran up
urgent radiogram sir

  i grabbed the envelope tore it open

  troglodyte vessel threatening london sighted

near barnes trailing long net poison gas put one
anti-aircraft depot out of action return with your
sparking gun at once transport ready at every point
-carrington commander-in-chief

londons peril

rita jumped up and grasped my hand across the
table

it sounds awful but im glad in a way max
you were going to say something particularly dreadful
i could see it in your face now we shall just have to
drop our silly quarrel and get to work im packing
you off this moment i am staying here to get out
these copies of the specifications when the patent
rights are secured i shall despatch the copies to the
various military centres that require them hopkins
will start for new york the moment he gets his copy
ill see to all these details-off you go

  it was an immense relief to have to act instead of
talk-to have a secretary so resourceful-to have fin-
ished with our wretched recriminations

  i admired rita courtney more just then than i had
ever done before i was ready to eat all my words
and should have done so if she had let me but she
was like all women intensely practical and matter-of-
fact at the proper time

  i was hustled out of the hotel to the garage and
with the sparking gun was shortly on the way to the
coast a fast destroyer was awaiting us in the chan-
nel and rushed us across to dover there we trans-
shipped to a special train which with line clear before
it prepared to give us a record run to the metropolis

  but whatever the speed it was too slow for ones
thoughts every moment was precious charged with
fate long before i reached london it might be lying
silent under a sea of smoky cloud i might only arrive
in time to witness the aftermath of that crowning
horror

  i stepped out at waterloo fifteen minutes under
express time general hartopp the well-known air
force expert greeted me thankfully

  all ready for you mr harding he said men
and motor lorries waiting to take you anywhere no
damage done since carrington sent you his radio the
beggars are hanging over muswell hill at present-
at a tremendous height been circling around for hours
either waiting for reinforcements waiting for more
of our guns to reveal themselves or else somewhat
staggered at the size of london what do you advise
as -our first action  i had thought of running out to
our no  anti-aircraft station firing at them letting
them drop a few bombs and then showing them that
their gas is useless

  have you got the streets clear in case we need to
move our gun about freely and rapidly

  thats the worst part of this complicated business
was the generals reply you see folks dont know
where the next shell may drop and they are on the
verge of panic trains tubes trams buses taxis
are all busy with people on the move all outward bound
we have all the men on duty that we can possibly get 
but london is so vast so unwieldy that any moment
the world at bay



we may je swept off our feet in a frenzied rush we
have spread the news of your paris success and the
fact that you are now due here but they feel that you
cant be everywhere at once the very next shell that
falls may be like a match put to powder panic-
disaster

  it mustnt fall then said i making a sudden de-
cision have you any army balloons in commission
in the london area  the only place to fight this fellow
safely is in the air itself ive been thinking it out all
the way across

  in an ordinary gas-bag great scott never
thought of that they can outfly and outsoar our
planes worse luck yes we have a couple of biggish
gas-bags in the crystal palace grounds-we kept send-
ing them up on look-out duty if you are really serious
mr harding ill wire for one to be got ready at once
but-what about their paralyzing ray

  a couple of pieces of thin sheet lead to act as
shields said i with a sudden inspiration that
should protect us-if you will go up with me ive
an idea it will be well worth risking their gas need
not bother us-it sinks as it expands and we shall be
jumping up we can safely leave the gun down here
in the care of some of your handy men

  i dont quite see what we can do if we go up hard-
ing said the alert airman but if its good enough
for you its good enough for me ill go up with you
jump in here wait till ive wired to the palace and
well start

  our chauffeur experienced transport driver though
he was wiped the perspiration from his brow when we
pulled up at our destination

  wouldnt do that run again for a fortune he
jerked out only god knows how we did it

  the balloon already nearly inflated when the gen-
erals order arrived was released immediately we
stepped into the basket the earth fell from under us
instantly in a few moments we were hanging in
emptiness london far below rising quickly

  two-three-four thousand feet said the general
consulting the barometer still going up the sun
is warming the gas and theres scarcely a breath of
wind we shall soon be alongside the enemy-if only
they will condescend to wait for us whats the
programme 

  my idea general is to capture that vessel i said
pointing to the troglodyte airplane hovering still above
us and now slowly moving about as though uncertain
what to do you be ready to throw out ballast when
i give the word for we shall need to jump up soon
and jump quickly i think i can do the rest have
your lead shield handy

  up and up we went till we were almost on the same
level as the trog they fired a gas shell at us that
burst into a grey cloud a sack of ballast overboard
and we were above the danger

  how i envied the trogs their ease and rapidity of
movement they rose slightly floating just above us
and drew slowly nearer in a spiral curve

  hartopp and i had each got repeating rifles and at
my signal we both fired together at a trog who was

pushing a paralysis tube over to take aim at us with
a yell of pain he threw up his arms and the deadly tube
pitched overboard

  just at that moment a cloud passed slowly between
us and the sun came a chill breath of air and with
that coolness the gas in the envelope contracted enough
to send us down two hundred feet

  only the prompt sacrifice of ballast and the return
of the sunlight sent us up again in time to escape the
second gas cloud they tried to smother us in but
now we were above them and our chance had come

  looking back on our exploit now i can see only
too clearly what a mad insane freak it was had the
trogs been half as daring as we were had they taken
the measure of our powers that day would have seen
the end of max harding and general hartopp our
very confidence must have scared our foes and their
own confidence and curiosity proved their undoing

  pull the valve cord general and drop us along-
side i cried poke your rifle over the basket-edge
and drop the first beggar who makes a move now

ritas appeal

  t seems incredible even to me in retrospection but
    the stratagem succeeded

       as balloon and airplane came alongside hanging
level our rifles spoke rapidly the trog who was at
the control wheel and another who was training his
flame pistol upon us collapsed with ludicrous urgency
hartopp fired again and dropped a third

  they jumped up a hundred feet we threw out more
ballast and followed them we were now not six feet
away

  surrender your ship or we shall destroy you all
descend as we descend give up your weapons when
you land and your lives shall be spared if you refuse
we shall follow you and kill you all with our fire-guns

  at least thats the purport of what i yelled at the
trogs in the best i could manage of their language and
in the most swaggeringly raucous voice i could
command

  it worked they grunted and screamed aloud in
their surprise and fright at hearing their own tongue

  it was a fortunate thing i knew enough to make
them understand i said to hartopp what a gor-
geous bluff they could get away from us any mo-
ment if they werent too scared theyre coming
down drop us gently side by side and keep your
rifle on them

  right-oh said the imperturbable airman shes
emptying fine we shall land on hampstead heath if
this little breeze holds splendid mr harding
splendid

  just on the edge of the heath the trog vessel came
to earth a crowd that had gathered to watch our
descent ran to seize our trail rope a squad of royal
air force men rushed to the spot then we were
afoot and quickly disarmed our seven trog prisoners
they were too surprised and dazed to offer resistance
as the soldiers-to save them from the threatening
mob-pushed them into a motor lorry and drove off

  for the time at any rate london was saved and


amazing stories

 what was almost more important was the moral effect
 of this second victory humanity took heart of cour-
 age once more on sea on land and in the air it
 was proved that the trogs were not invincible and
 that they could be fought and beaten and all the
 world from that moment set itself to work upon the
 one supreme task of ridding its surface from the
 destroyers

   i skip over the rejoicings and ovations of that day
 they were sufficiently embarrassing and upsetting to
 a shy journalist without having to write about them
 i come to the evening of the day after when in com-
 pany with several of the best engineers in the air
 force i was examining the captured troglodyte vessel
 a big marquee had been put up over it electric light
 wires run across to it and a cordon of regulars kept
 off the crowd

   the engineering details of the ship were a revelation
 to us in particular the simple construction and tre-
 mendous power of the radium motor excited our ad-
 miration the method of breaking up the radium and
 releasing its atomic force was very wasteful we could
 see but what did that matter to the trogs when they
 had tons of the material only requiring to be mined

   there was enough motive power aboard we calcu-
 lated for a five-thousand-mile non-stop flight there
 were ten gas bombs three nerve-paralyzing guns and
 four flame pistols

   with the help and advice of one of the trog prison-
 ers who seemed more amenable to reason than his
 companions our men quickly learned the use and con-
 trol of the various gadgets very carefully but very
 successfully we made a trial flight of an hour we
 rose and fell vertically got up a horizontal speed of
  miles per hour we shot out a gas bomb-and
 dissipated it with our own spark-ray we paralyzed one
 of our number-and brought him out of the helpless
 state we learned that the atomic discharge of the flame
 pistols was so great that each pistol could only fire
 once and then was useless it was a weapon which
 every trog on reaching maturity was given to keep
 as a weapon to be used only in the last resort

   when we had descended after our successful trip
 and the vessel was being hauled into the shelter of the
 big tent somebody suddenly materialized out of the
 shadows at my side rita tired-eyed smiling

   crossed over and came up at once max did all
 the work arranged you are wonderful do you
 know what this capture means to us

   it means that we can fight them on equal terms now
 -soar as they can soar we can build a fleet of vessels
 such as this

    is that all i just hate to spoil anything but where
 are you going to get the radium from you and i
 know where there is plenty

   still harping on that mad idea rita said i we
 are going to beat the trogs to their knees first and
 one of our conditions of victory will be a supply of
  radium from below another will be the release of
 all our prisoners the general command is consider-
 ing all that at this very moment expecting news any
 time now

  as a matter of fact replied this amazing woman
ive just been advised of their decision they see the
case as i see it they think we ought to try to seize
the outlet hold it and then make terms with the
trogs you and i being the only persons who can
make ourselves understood by the enemy must go
there and that is what this splendid capture of yours
means my dear stupid max with this vessel we
can carry out the expedition

  and incidentally we risk the vessel and our own
lives and with this vessel we can even descend the
outlet and make an effort to rescue-well john rixon
at least

  rita gave me her hands and looked me straight in
the eyes

  max she said in a low voice will you listen to
me just this once if we can save john rixon from
that living death underground we must do so a great
man such as he must not be lost to the race i know-
why shouldnt i admit it -that you love me no
dont speak yet i know it i cant help knowing it
im glad to know it but i should be gladder still to
know that you could rise above the jealousy that
mars ordinary folk i want you to try to save him
you want me to try to save him for you-to give
up all hope of winning you for myself

  its your test max she said i shall know then
that you love me with the sort of higher love that every
true woman values in her inmost heart i shall know
that you are living up to the high standard ive set
for you you will come willingly you will help me

back to the underworld

when rita courtney appealed to me like that
could there be any doubt about my response
my hard mood broke up giving way as a
log-jam suddenly gives on a canadian river

  i will help you willingly rita i will do anything
to make you happy when do we start

  it sounds banal antipathetic but high-falutin
heroics were never in my line i couldnt put into
words the feeling i had that some psychic understand-
ing had leapt from soul to soul that in some mysterious
way rita courtney and i were nearer to each other in
that moment than we had ever been before

  if the vessel can be got ready we start in the
morning the general command is very keen

  she released my hands gave a little sigh of relief
of content

  i will see that it is ready said i our folks
have taken all measurements and particulars of the
airship and its engines and they will be able to build
a fleet to pattern if required if we can manage to
bring back a supply of radium from down under what
i am not quite happy about rita is exactly what we
are going to do when we reach the bottom of the out-
let-if we get that far

  im hoping that john will be expecting us said
she you know that he and a few more prisoners
were trying to manufacture crystal radio sets as there
were plenty of suitable minerals in the rocks and lots
of wire it is queer that the trogs for all their
the world at bay



mechanical cleverness never invented radio well all
the governments are now busy sending out powerful
long-wave radio messages in morse on the chance that
john may pick them up

  and we shall not go to the outlet alone we shall
be convoyed by a squadron of fast airplanes and fol-
lowed by several big airships with supplies we shall
settle in the great crater and while we are descending
the shaft the others will be able to deal with any tro-
glodyte vessel that may be returning to the outlet
remember they can know nothing of what we are
doing and will be quite unprepared for our coup

  it sounded all right ritas heart was set upon the
expedition

  taking with us the troglodyte prisoner who seemed
less scared less hostile than his fellows we began our
southward voyage next day we had a great send-off
from hendon and having fitted a receiver aboard were
in touch with news all the way the vessel was steady
as a rock and proved wonderfully easy to control
once we had mastered its features 

  news came in constantly and everywhere humanity
was recovering from its panic and despair every-
where the troglodytes were being met with resistance
were being attacked

  arsenals and workshops in nearly every country
were busy making dispersers

  the worst news came from south africa the
trogs had been more thoroughly vicious there in a
more wholesale way than anywhere else their raids
had so disorganized the life of the community and so
worked on the superstitious fears of the natives that
there had been a great black uprising

  a new tchaka had arisen and the dreaded zulu
impis once again swept over the land in a torrent of
slaughter coherent resistance there was none though
the holding of johannesburg by the whites will rank in
history with the heroic defense of lucknow

  the railways were deserted and rapidly overgrown
the smoke of kaffir kraals went up where once had
been white mens towns the beasts of the wild came
back south of the orange river it was a melancholy
story-a glimpse of what might have happened in
northern africa in india in the southern states of
america had no fortunate help come to the world had
not rita and myself escaped in time

  it is not modern to talk of providence of a con-
trolling hand in our affairs said rita i once used
to scoff at such ideas myself but now im not so sure
i have a feeling which i cant get rid of that there has
been more than coincidence in our adventures we
have been guided protected spared-for a purpose

  i believe that too said i

  we reached the devastated area the vast arid wound
on the green face of the amazon forest without mis-
hap we descended vertically to the flat space used by
the trog vessels and our ten convoy planes came to
rest on the best patches of ground they could find
later the three large airships arrived carrying petrol
and other supplies and then we came to the snag
that we had discussed till we were tired of discussion
in the trog vessel we had of course a disperser

which got its power from a radium charge that we
should have to take down with us to protect us from a
gas attack either in the shaft or at the bottom

  then what of our convoy left above their guns
would no doubt make short work of any trogs com-
ing home unsuspectingly but what would happen when
some more alert trog captain heralded his approach
with gas bombs 

  our only hope was in making the descent of the
shaft rescuing our friends and returning before dis-
aster happened

  all my doubts objections fears came back to me in
full force as the helicopter after hovering above the
black centre of the crater began its downward journey
the troglodyte prisoner assisting us eagerly-he was
going home-we let the vessel fall like a plummet into
the darkness then carefully gradually we brought
the lifting screws to work checking our speed and so
grinding roaring we went down down

  it was madness-sheer stark madness i was a fool
the authorities were fools we had let ourselves be
hypnotized by a womans fierce resolve to save her
lover and i i loved her and i was throwing my life
away-and her own life too-to save my rival

into the depths

at last we emerged from the long darkness came
into the great opening at the foot of the shaft-
 into the flickering phosphorescent light that lit
the strange scenery of that strange world with its
ghastly glow

  the vessel grounded with a jarring shock settling
alongside another plane that appeared to be deserted

  of course we had counted upon the unexpectedness
of our descent for our immediate safety the trogs
could not be aware of our coming would think the
vessel was one of their own manned by some of them-
selves the quiet unmolested landing however was
nevertheless uncanny

  very few trogs were in evidence but a couple of
people who were walking about-a couple of humans
unshaven ragged dirty dejected-looking-suddenly
rushed up to us as we stepped down to earth

  we were shaking hands with john rixon and dick
martin

  have to pour it all out right away max said dick
in a husky voice no time to be polite things havent
panned out so badly but its just touch and go with us
at this moment

then they didnt imprison you when we got away

  oh yes they did and a rough time i had of it but
good old john got me out he doctored the great
panjandrum again and the old chap was so pleased he
set me at liberty when john asked him

  now we are fixed like this just now we have left
the prison camp down under-hopeless-and have
managed to hang round here we try to get a word
with the new arrivals warn them what to expect and
so on but his royal nibs has got another touch of
the flu-lots of the troggies caught it on their voy-
ages and brought it down with them-and from all we
hear he is in a vile temper he will be sending for john


amazing stories

almost any minute and if he isnt cured slick this time
and really cured well-its us for the great beyond
im glad youve got here in time

  then drawing me aside dick whispered

  dont be too jolted when you get talking to john
he has worked himself to rags and had one or two
touches of the flu himself hes about at the end if
you hadnt come now im afraid you would have come
too late to save him im not feeling particularly fit
myself i can tell you

  i turned to greet john rixon as he relinquished
ritas hands he had been holding them as though he
would never let go it was fortunate that dick had
given me those words of warning

  such an utter change in a man i have seldom seen
and yet i ought not to have been surprised knowing
the work he had done and the deadly horror of that
underground world in which he had lived and toiled
the marvel was that he-or any of us-had kept sane
and preserved life and spirit at all

  his face was pinched and drawn his frame was
shrunken his hands were unsteady there were streaks
of grey in his dark hair only the eyes held their old
fire their old force

  glad you succeeded glad youve come harding
he said dick will have told you how we are fixed
here i never thought both of you would have taken
this terrible risk

  then you heard from us-you expected us

 yes after your message we have got a couple of
crystal sets of sorts and a fellow who can read morse
like a book if only we could have sent you a reply
i would have stopped rita coming down here again
you wouldnt john she cried

  its foolhardy work rita girl mad senseless
it is very unlikely we shall get away unless we start
soon you are surprised that im leaving the prisoners
to their fate the job has got beyond me its awful
horrible down there all sorts of folks-mixed races
-black yellows browns they are out of hand
wont listen to reason have to be driven to the mines
like slaves-or beasts i cant bear to think of the
things ive seen there has been jealousy suspicion
some of the prisoners seeing us going about freely
have accused us of being traitors of being paid tools
of the trogs they nearly killed dick once and ive
been threatened often

  im not coming away because of that the position
is absolutely hopeless and im not the man i was when
you went up im not the superman i thought i was-
god forgive me

  im ready to go back at once-we had better start
arent there any more we can save the vessel
will carry at least a score

  it was a dreadfully changed john rixon who replied
to me

  there was no time to be lost it was impossible to
get down to the prisoners camp beyond the lake and
the prison works even if we got there we should be
mobbed attacked we must save ourselves

  much as i had disliked the man i found now that i
had admired respected him still more it brought a

queer lumpy feeling into my throat to see him thus

  and at the same time i felt that thus broken and
despairing he was an even more formidable rival than
the old resourceful courageous dominant john

  rita would pity him yearn over him even if she
had not loved him before she would assuredly love him
now for not only are love and pity akin-they are
woven of the self-same mind-stuff i saw the faint
hope that i had begun to cherish anew in spite of all
sense and reason fading away

  for knowledge of the catastrophe that happened in
the next few moments we have to rely on general
hartopps vigilance whilst we were absorbed in our
meeting he had turned to the wireless and with ear-
phones on was listening to news from above ground
even the strange world into which we had come did
not divert him from his duty he got the news all
well he told us afterwards and then noticed our
troglodyte prisoner making signs to a group of other
troglodytes in a distant part of the vast cave

  the prisoner went on to hammer on the metal frame-
work of the vessel-systematic rhythmic tappings that
were quickly answered by a faint cadence of similar
noises all around us

  being sure that our prisoner was in some way be-
traying us to his folk hartopp sprang upon him closed
with him and bore him to the floor of the hold we
heard the tappings and the answering signals and
rushed to his aid

  in the struggle the trog managed to secure the flame
pistol carried by the general-we had all armed our-
selves with one of these weapons when we captured
the vessel in london-and immediately discharged its
enormous atomic energy

  but the troglodyte did not trouble to expend that
energy upon us he aimed at the ships engine and
lifting propeller when the blinding searing flash of
light went out a hole a void a nothingness was where
the motive power and mechanism had been the ves-
sel was now a useless immovable hulk

  once more we were captives of this underworld

the grater is a sea of gas

or a moment we were shocked into stupid inac-
tion all of us that is except hartopp

  he is a big man with a strong irish strain in his
ancestry and tough and agile as the trog was the
airman got him down pinned him to the deck with
one hand he held the creature by the throat with his
service revolver gripped in the other hand he nearly
finished the job

  stop dont cried rita hold him but dont
kill him we want him he will be useful besides
it was splendid of him to act like that he is loyal to
his race to his people

  the troglodyte could not understand her words of
course but he evidently grasped her meaning he
ceased to struggle and when hartopp reluctantly re-
leased him and allowed him to scramble to his feet
he shook himself like a dog just out of the water then
he turned to rita with an expression of gratitude that
was almost comically pathetic his pasty white face
the world at bay



was wrinkled in a most ludicrously ugly fashion

  love sacrifice justice we had already found these
in the underworld now we could add to them loyalty
and gratitude

  by now the whole great cave was full of life
troglodytes were running towards us from all direc-
tions and the rock tappings sounded all around us
and several airplanes emerged roaring from the shad-
owy corridors in the dim distance

  roused a regular hornets nest said dick we
look like being well stung i was afraid we couldnt
get away with it whats our line 

  stand by the vessel whats left of it said hartopp
assuming command luckily our radio set is still in-
tact we are still in touch with our people up above
in the crater

  the troglodytes were now all around us closing in
upon us an alarmed a curious an angry crowd many
flourished their long metal rods some of them threat-
ened us with their precious flame pistols

  on our part we held our own weapons and the two
flame pistols we still possessed well in evidence

  we had better parley-voo a bit or whatever you call
it down here said general hartopp ye gods what
a hole what a nightmare crush of hobgoblins

  we expected a fierce attack every moment but for
some reason or other the trogs held back they sur-
rounded us they threatened us that was all

  it is strange that they did not try to paralyze us
with their violet rays murmured rixon i say mur-
mured for the force had gone out of the mans once
strong voice they could easily do it it is a regu-
lar occurrence down-down there

  they are afraid of the flame pistols we carry said
rita also i think they are afraid of our paralysis
tubes luckily they dont know the tubes were de-
stroyed along with the motors just now besides john
i believe the trogs are waiting for the tall person dick
so irreverently terms the big noise-otherwise the
troglodyte chief they are very puzzled about us too
-how we came to have their vessel and why we have
ventured down here

  i noticed that she had drawn john rixons arm
through her own was soothing him by word and tone
as one would comfort a sickly child oh i was a
fool a mad fool what was i doing here why was
i not breathing the pure free sunlit air of the upper
world instead of waiting for certain death in this
gloomy land of shadows

 rita went on i have not yet given up hope we
must make our prisoner talk to them-he will be more
fluent than either max or myself we must get him to
tell them how we are defeating them above ground
how we have seized the top of the outlet and that we
are ready to make terms

  the prisoner prompted by us got up and spoke to
his fellows he grunted gesticulated rolled his eyes
swung his arms we could follow him well enough to
know that he was telling them how numerous and des-
perate humanity was how we had captured the air-
plane how rita had saved his life

  it didnt make any difference to the hostile crowd

they growled grimaced and threatened us the more
yet they shrank from action

  they wait for ul-ulfa the chief said our pris-
oner see-he comes

  an air vessel emerged from one of the distant
shadowy corridors into the great opening where we
lay the tall broad-browed dignified troglodyte who
had passed sentence on ulf and ulla on dick and my-
self alighted from it and advanced towards us a
guard of a dozen squat troglodytes armed with flame
pistols came with him

  as he approached every troglodyte bowed to the
ground in reverence as he passed them they stood
up again eager angry expectant ready for instant
action

  ul-ulfa spoke rapidly with our prisoner so rapidly
that we could scarcely follow him and our trog replied
in the same staccato fashion

  with every nerve strung to highest tension-or so it
seemed till a few moments later-we listened and
waited

  then hartopp who had intermittently been switch-
ing our receiver on and off clapped the headphones to
his ears suddenly he broke in upon our silence with a
smothered expletive his face went pale despite its
ruddy tan he started speaking in quick jerky sen-
tences

  a message from bennett top of the outlet at-
tacked by fleet of returning trog vessels lot of gas
bombs fired caught our chaps unawares-came at
great height no chance bennetts aero last one un-
touched he was making desperate efforts to get go-
ing before the poison cloud reached him he told me
the crater is a sea of gas it is closing round us it
will be a close shave i think- and there his mes- 
sage stopped

 a royal hostage

we knew too well what that message that unfin-
ished message meant i could see as plainly
as though i had been above ground the sudden
rain of troglodyte bombs from a clear sky the unroll-
ing of the grey poison cloud as it sank into the crater
filling up the vast cavity as water collects in a shallow
pool the game and frantic efforts of our airmen all
too late to get their vessels going i saw bennetts
wireless operator sending us his message speaking to
the microphone up to the last moment till the gas
rolled over him silencing him forever

  nor was that the worst of it the trogs once more
were masters of the outlet if they dispersed the gas
and came down we should be liable to attack from
overhead if theytiad any inkling of our expedition
they might leave that sea of gas for a time and return
for us would be impossible even if we had a vessel in
working order and that they would not guess our pur-
pose in occupying the outlet that they would not know
that we were at the foot of the shaft was very un-
likely we had come to rate their abilities rather higher
with fuller knowledge of their ways

  im afraid this is the end really the end said john
rixon im sorfy rita for your sake for myself


amazing stories

-well ive got into that state of mind when nothing
seems to matter very much we must take whatever
punishment ul-ulfa gives us

  not without a fight though said hartopp with
grim determination they may kill me but they will
never take me to die down there in the mines youve
told me about

  listen his nibs is talking to us cried dick

  the tall troglodyte stepped nearer away from his
guards seemingly confident and unafraid he began
to speak and then-

  he sneezed

  yes-sneezed sneezed violently uncontrollably
rapidly sneezed as though he were never going to
stop the sort of sneeze that rasps your throat and
makes your sides ache and he flourished a huge
dirty pocket handkerchief

  the only rag i had left-i gave it to him ex-
plained john rixon

  into ritas eyes came a sudden gleam of light i
had seen that gleam before and i knew that she had
found some hope of escape some chance some possi-
bility of rescue from our dilemma

  have you any quinine left john

  rixon produced a small bottle from somewhere in
his ragged coat he rattled the contents

  two tablets-thats all

  then invite the king here and offer to cure him if
he will spare us and send us aloft

  he may promise but thats as far as we should get
objected dick much as they all kow-tow to his
nibs i fancy there are limits to their docility ive
heard some of them talking on the quiet if he gives
us a free pardon im dead sure some of the others will
do us in

  never mind just now what you fancy mr martin
snapped rita we are in a position where we must
take risks i have a plan that may yet save us get
the chief here john and hold him in conversation about
his cold all invalids like to talk about their ailments
sympathize with him and whilst you are talking to
him keep one ear open to what im telling the others
rixon obeyed without a questioning word

  he must have been very persuasive very convincing
for the trog chief his fit of sneezing over at last
stepped up to the deck of the damaged airship fear-
lessly and stood listening to our friend pleasurable
relief and angry annoyance struggled for mastery of his
face

  i want you to see exactly what im driving at and
to act upon it at the first possible moment said rita
speaking rapidly you have all heard of the con-
quistadors the spanish conquerors of mexico and
peru they were a handful of men fixed as we are
in the midst of a big hostile population what was
their first move they seized the person of the king
cortez got hold of montezuma and pizarro kidnapped
atahualpa the subjects of each of these kings held
them in such reverence that for a time the spaniards
were able to do what they liked they made the captive
kings give orders dictated by themselves and the peo-
ple obeyed now we have ul-ulfa in our grasp we

must seize him keep him and use him as a hostage for
our own safety and we must act at once

  you are great miss courtney cried hartopp
another victim i groaned to myself leave that
part of it to me now then all of you ready here
goes

  the big man pushed rixon aside and seized the
troglodyte king pinning his arms to his side and spin-
ning him round violently a fierce chorus of grunting
screams rose from the spectators and the crowd rushed
to the attack

  the nearest guard recovering from his astonished
stupefaction at the sight sprang toward hartopp the
general loosed his left hand found his service revolver
and shot the trog dead

  then he pressed the revolver muzzle against the head
of the king whom he now held at arms length by a
grip on the collar of his rough tunic

  the king didnt struggle at all he seemed too aston-
ished too dazed too shaken out of his wits to make any
effective resistance he was unarmed except for a
flame pistol which dick deftly removed from his girdle

  tell em whats what you folks roared hartopp
tell em ill blow his head off if they do a thing to us
i cant hold him like this very long

  rixon stood up facing the infuriated throng

  would they listen to him would they understand
were they as concerned about the life of their king as
we hoped

we make a truce

rixon had to shout-and a forced raucous shout
it was-to make himself heard but he did make
 himself heard and the rush was checked before
any damage was done of course standing on the deck
of the air vessel and protected partly by its metal sides
we had the advantage of position

  and hartopps dramatic pose was no doubt elo-
quent if they could not understand all the halting
troggese of john rixons remarks they could not
fail to see their kings danger they had seen their
comrade go down to one shot and must have realized
that we were as formidable as we were desperate

  your king has come to us for cure of his disease
was what john rixon said-or tried to say anyhow
the gist the meaning got across they waited silent
at last i shall cure him i shall make him healthy
again but i shall not do this unless he is here with
us he shall not come to any harm but we shall guard
him with our lives you will bring food and drink for
us-and for him but whilst we are in peril from any
of you we shall not let him go from us

  there was a brief stupefied silence then a trog
pushed himself to the front

  let ul-ulfa speak he growled let the king tell
us his wishes with his own lips

- a chorus of shouts gave approval

  tell them that you agree with me that you will stay
with us that no harm is to come to us said rixon
ill cure you but only if you agree if you dont-

  he nodded to hartopp and the airman pressed the
cold circle of steel into the kings ear
 the world at bay



  i agree you have me in your power said the king
not without a scornful dignity then turning and fac-
ing his subjects he spoke to them he spoke quickly
he spoke a long time it was hard to follow him but
we managed to learn that he told them he was in our
hands for the time being and that they would have to
accept the situation

  at the end with many angry and threatening cries
and gestures at us the crowd bowed to him and dis-
persed a few knots of them remained in the great
cave however disputing amongst themselves

  some of the big guns of the underworld said dick
ive heard them at it before not exactly republicans
but they dont hold the kings life in quite so much
esteem as the rank and file do they dont like his
leniency to me and john they may make mischief
yet

  the fact remains that we have come out of that
very well said hartopp but now we have secured
our royal prisoner what are we going to do with him
miss courtney better tie him up to prevent his stray-
ing away first thing then we must make him get us a
vessel fitted up to take us away

  i dont think i should tie him at all said rita
thoughtfully there are five of us and one can always
be on guard i feel sure he quite understands the posi-
tion and knows that at the first hostile move either
on his part or on the part of his people we shall kill
him and he doesnt want to die he doesnt like be-
ing ill with this nasty ailment he has caught from some-
one who brought it down from our world in fact hes
very sorry for himself and its up to us to do more than
keep him and cure him

  more this from hartopp

  yes we have the finest opportunity we shall ever
have of putting an end to this terror we must con-
vince him that his cause is hopeless we must use him
to make his people surrender

  its a great idea i cried dick meantime we are
stuck down here and dont know whether we shall ever
see the sun again

  theres the radio we may hear news of what they
are doing to rescue us said i bennetts message
must have been received by others besides ourselves
its a pity we didnt try to bring some sort of transmit-
ting instrument down with us but of course i ex-
pected we should be back safely before now

  hartopp turned to the receiver switched it on
twiddled his dials puckered his brows then he pulled
out the front and examined the wiring at back

  all ok and yet nothing coming through cant
understand it ah hang it all-nothing but a blurred
roar

  at that moment the prosphorescent light that fitfully
lit the cavern was glowing at its brightest rixon con-
sulted his wrist watch

  just noon he said im afraid the radioactive
light when at its peak neutralizes your valves you
will get nothing more till the light dies down ive
found out that it reaches a maximum at midnight and
noon-in fact its a sort of tidal wave of etheric energy
resulting from the earths rotation the trogs make

their time measurements by it and their day is almost
exactly the same as ours youll have to wait

  waiting was just what we wanted least of all in our
nervous state but there was no help for it

  to pass the time we practised our troggese on the
king and the prisoner they were as restless and wor-
ried as ourselves ul-ulfa in particular proved eager
to talk

  he had heard much of the strange wonders of the
outer world from his own people as well as from john
rixon

  of course with a touching faith in the latters heal-
ing powers he had already swallowed the two tablets of
ammoniated quinine he believed he would get better
at once and his belief was no doubt a great factor in
his immediate recovery

  he desired to go out and see this strange cold daz-
zling light upper world for himself but the council of
elders had refused to let him risk his royal person in
such dangerous regions we gathered that he would
not object to going up with us if we guaranteed a safe
return the chief fear he had was that in his absence
the trogs might elect another king

  we even got a few gleams of light on the history of
the troglodytes-gleams confirmed by bits of informa-
tion picked up by dick and john

  it seems fairly certain that the dominant trog race
we had met were the survivors of a long and bitter
warfare between various races of the underworld it
had been a fierce struggle waged without mercy the
victors had compelled the beaten tribes to work the
deadly mines for them the work had exterminated
the luckless slaves the supply of criminals had fallen
short of their needs and they had been driven to force
a way up to the earths surface they had always had
some sort of knowledge some vague tradition of the
existence-of an upper world from which they had once
come

  working back as well as we can from our scanty
data we believe that this vast honeycombed region was
laid open to the air in the permian age and probably
colonized by a sub-branch of the anthropoid ancestors
of mankind in the miocene then some convulsion of
the earths crust imprisoned them and through long
ages they learned to exist and adapt themselves to the
strange conditions

  and thats as far as we plus all the learned scientists
in the world have got in the history of the trogs and
its as far as we ever shall get we shall never know

  the trogs brought us food and water as agreed
upon for several days on the fourth day a big crowd
of them poured into the cavern excited angry vo-
ciferous

  two of the leaders pushed to the front and spoke
with the king

  ul-ulfas white face went whiter still

good news and bad

  t was an ultimatum that the trogs had come to
    present to their king and to ourselves

and no wonder the old boy is scared said
dick hes in the soup whichever he does it seems


amazing stories

to me and we are in it up to the neck too
  what do they say asked hartopp

  they are tired of waiting translated rixon they
have heard from the top of the outlet by their tap-
signal s as you have heard from our people when the
radio worked there have been several attempts by our
folks to re-take the outlet but lacking a disperser
they have all failed the trogs on top have decided to
stay there and defend it and no vessels have tried to
go up or down whilst we are here you see we are
in rather a good position just here-in a dog-in-the-
manger-ish sort of way wtih our flame pistols we
could make short work of any descending plane
well what are they threatening to do about it
persisted hartopp we cant stop here forever
the old guard the dyed-in-the-wool troglodytes
who are not exactly in love with ul-ulfa have given us
two days more in which to hand him over and surrender
ourselves if we dont-well they are going to wipe us
out-all of us including the king himself they will
fill the outlet with gas from above and this cave from
below as our dispersing tube went in that bit of work
done by your prisoner along with our engines we are
helpless

  what does the king say about it for my part
looking at their fishy faces i believe they are just try-
ing a big bluff was hartopps reply

  im afraid the elders at least mean business
said rita they have probably another aspirant to
the throne ready to step into ul-ulfas shoes he
thinks they will act-if we dont surrender

  and yet he does not ask us to give him up-i ad-
mire the old boy for that said john rixon he sees
that we cant for our own sake so he is sending the
deputation back and telling them we shall give them
our answer at the end of the time theres really no
hope either for him or for us i am more than ever
sorry rita that you came down here again on this
foolish errand

  dear old john dont worry about me we have
just got to face the worst together as best we can

  it seemed to me in my gloomy despairing mind
that in the presence of danger these two were drawing
ever nearer and nearer together certainly in john
rixons state of sickness of soul and body he needed
the comforting the petting the companionship that
only a woman could give

  i ought not to have grudged him that little ameliora-
tion of the plight he shared with all of us i am not
sure that i did grudge it to him and yet-and yet-
the two days passed all too quickly and none too
pleasantly though we were all companions in ad-
versity i am sorry to say that our tempers were not
what they should have been they were frayed we
snapped at each other when we were not sullenly silent
or when we were not explaining how this that or the
other ought to have been done before the expedition
was undertaken

  human nature i suppose

  we gave our trog prisoner his freedom as we had
no further need of him but he preferred to stop and
wait upon his king

  he was a loyalist to the backbone

  at such intervals as we could get our set to function
properly we heard fragmentary news from the upper
world

  the fight against the trogs was being waged every-
where with enthusiasm if with fluctuating success the
enemy had been driven out of europe their camp in
the atlas had been destroyed they had left australia
but were masters of nearly all south america hop-
kins had been busy in the states and with the dis-
perser guns he had helped them to build the u s
airmen had chased the trogs south of panama

  the last we heard of hopkins was that he was with
an air squadron operating in venezuela

  the two days grace passed off uneventfully except
for the one frustrated attack made upon us by a band
of the more dissatisfied trogs

  they crept up to us during a minimum of the flick-
ering light dodging from shadow to shadow each of
them carried a paralysis tube and their hope was to
catch us unawares and reduce us to helplessness

  it was general hartopps turn to be on guard and
he admits that he was almost asleep when a sudden
rustling dragging sound near the vessel roused him to
activity his quick revolver shots woke us all and now
we found the lead shields we had brought proved their
worth but for their shelter their impermeability by
the curious nerve-numbing violet light our days would
indeed have been numbered

  the shields protected us the attack failed and the
trogs drew off sullenly taking their dead and wounded
with them

  let me say here that we never had any inkling of
what the troglodytes did with their dead whether
they cremated them or buried them in the deep mines
or desiccated them in chambers filled with poison gas
we never discovered

  so we came to the end of our term of grace it was
still a couple of hours before the actual time limit but
the great cave and its approaches were already filling
up with a concourse of armed and excited trogs even
to us it was evident that there were two factions
amongst them-one led by the elders who cared more
for the race than for the mere person of the king and
the other formed of the common herd who blindly wor-
shipped their sovereign

  and the king-worshippers im thankful to see are
the bigger lot said dick not that it seems to mat-
ter much to us in our fix

  im not sure said hartopp who was crouching
over his radio with ear-phones on just listen to this
thats coming through cant understand it at all dont
see how hes done it how he could get here in the time
but i suppose  oh dammit

  its hopkins the fellow you dropped on in sydney
speaking this is what he says got here and cleared
up the whole caboose not a trog breathing up here
not a trog vessel that aint smashed but im stuck
waiting for help top of the outlet-and a god-
forsaken spot it is if you are still alive and kicking
down at the bottom of that hole come up slick our
machine crashed and crocked up hopkins calls-hop-
the world at bay



kins top of outlet thats what he says as well as i
can put it and he keeps on calling

  cleared the crater come to help us and then
smashed up himself was there ever such rotten luck
groaned dick martin

out of the darkness

  mien that puts finis to the book of our lives
 said john rixon calmly despondently as one
 a who accepts the worst that fate can do and is
 not unduly grieved my chief regret rita is that you
 are here-when you need not have been here

  rita did not reply for a few moments when she
looked up i caught again that bright gleam in her
eyes-that gleam of hope-of light ahead

  and i am glad that i am here john yes very
glad what blind bats we are the way of escape is
open to us now that there is no danger at the top of the
outlet what is there to prevent us seizing another
trog vessel-this empty one alongside for choice-and
going up

  miss courtney youve said it cried hartopp
weve been down in this inferno till our brains-all
of em but yours-have gone mouldy of course we
go up and the quicker the better

   it was john rixons turn to voice objections to raise
 difficulties john rixon once the man of iron will of
 initiative of action

  we have to take the king with us remember we
have to rely on the loyalty of his people to save us
we have to find out whether the vessel we seize is in
working order if it has enough fuel

   we shall find all those things out when we get to
work-and not before said rita impatiently we
shall find nothing out if we just sit here and talk are
we all agreed  are we all ready  theres no time to
waste and it may be a matter of getting away by the
skin of our teeth

   it was i sometimes dream of that struggle that
frantic grasp of the one chance in a thousand that we
took and when i wake from that dream i find myself
bathed in perspiration and gasping

   we seized our weapons our lead shields and as much
 of our personal luggage as we could carry and jumped
 down from our damaged craft

   this was perhaps the most dangerous moment for
if the assembling trogs had caught us in the open our
end would have been sure but they were quite unpre-
pared for our move and before they had recovered
from their surprise we had all gained our new quarters
-or nearly all of us

   hartopp shepherding the king urging him along at
revolver point went first dick and i followed john
and rita brought up the rear with our trog prisoner
following we told him he need not come but he
followed

   there was an outcry a rush of angry trogs a scuf-
 fle blows some shots we who had gained the shelter
 of the air-vessels deck turned to see rita in the grasp
 of two squat creatures john shot one through the
 heart and as he fell rita wrenched herself free got
 out her flame pistol and wiped the other out of ex-

 istence she grasped our outstretched hands and jumped
 for safety

  out of the tail of my eye i saw another trog
levelling his flame pistol john rixon saw him at the
same moment we both sprang forward and pulled
rita in

  we should have been too late had not another seen
the danger and acted more promptly than we had done

  the troglodyte prisoner leaped upon her attacker
with the swiftness of a tigers leap as he leaped the
spurt of searing white radiance rushed from the pistol
the cave was lit by the ghastly glare of the atomic dis-
charge and when what seemed like darkness followed
our prisoner had ceased to be had been burned to ap-
parent nothingness

  rita had saved his life when hartopp would have
made an end of him he had paid the debt

   even self-sacrifice had we found in that grim under-
world even there in that night land of horror the
spark divine that is in all things was working upwards
to the light

  a scene of pandemonium followed the party led
by the elders uttering grunts of stern command tried
to reach us to surround us they used their flame pis-
tols recklessly and in the fierce glares of radiance that
stabbed the semi-gloom many a common trog looked
his last on the flickering light of his native land

  but the common herd were too numerous too fa-
natically loyal and surged around us in a packed pro-
tective mass the flame pistols deadly as they were
had one fatal defect-once discharged they were use-
less until they could be filled again which was a long
and dangerous process with all the knowledge we
gained from our brief contact with the troglodyte
world we did not learn that secret of releasing the
atomic energy in a lump of quartz crystal

   whilst this conflict raged we were busy inside the
air-vessel there was certainly some radio-fuel in the
engine for it started up at once on closing the switches
but how much we had how long it would keep going
we had no idea it was not wise to probe too much be-
hind the lead sheathing that housed the burning sub-
stance

  a few trial spurts showed that the lifting screws
were in order we raised the vessel from thefloor and
hung in mid-air throbbing shaking the trogs
gathered under and around grunting jabbering
pointing

  ul-ulfa stood at the side of the deck and looked
down on them he seemed to make a sudden resolu-
tion raised his hand and spoke nearly every unit in
the crowd bowed in reverence as well as i can re-
member this was what he said

   people i go to the upper world to see it for myself
it may be that the people of the upper air are too strong
for us if that be so i will make peace with them lest
they destroy us all let there be no more war between
us till i return

  an answering roar a babel of cries of which we
could make no sense broke out hartopp pressed all
the switches down and the vessel leaped up into the
blackness of the great shaft our one anxiety now was


amazing stories

whether the power would carry us to the top or not

hopkins tells his story

steadily slowly with roaring propellers and
grinding mechanism the vessel bore us upwards
through the eerie blackness upwards through the
long long shaft

  once the power failed or a cog slipped and we sank
down with a sickening lurch clutching at each other in
deadly fear then the vessel began to rise again and
kept on until we reached the top

  once more we breathed the fresh air of heaven once
more we saw the sun

  as hartopp maneuvered for position before alight-
ing alongside the wrecked vessel on which several peo-
ple were clustered waving their arms and cheering we
who had so wonderfully escaped from a living death
looked long into each others eyes

  oh my friend cried rita tears running down her
face-tears of joy of relief-forgive me forgive
me for having taken you down there again

  im glad rita glad said i it is i who need
forgiveness for trying to hold you back if we had not
saved dick and john i should never have forgiven
myself

  it was with welcome relief that we turned to meet
hopkins and the american naval captain in charge of
the wrecked air-vessel introductions over our expla-
nations were quickly made it was no wonder the of-
ficer lifted his neat eyebrows in amazement-our story
sounded miraculous unreal even to ourselves

  still it happened to be true and there we were and
there was our prisoner the king of all the trogs

  hopkins was bubbling over with enthusiasm and
pleasure at meeting us again

  say folk he cried wringing our hands vigorously
its bully to see you it was a good thing for me you
two ran up against jonas t hopkins in sydney its
put me right up amongst the big things its helped
me to forget

  you are looking at this vessel we were so all-fired
clumsy as to smash up gee it gave us a jolt when
it dropped on these rocks yes its a trog vessel
same pattern as yours

  i guessed it was or you wouldnt have been able to
clear the outlet said john rixon you managed to
bring a wireless outfit as well i see expecting help 

  any minute yes sirree no doubt the big wigs
will want us to tote his nibs here across to london to
negotiate peace terms as soon as we can leave a guard in
this abomination of desolation lord what a place
hundreds of square miles of steaming rotting fester-
ing jungle rivers and swamps and in the middle this
patch of torn-up ground like a big shell-hole and we
havent added to the beauty of it by scattering these
dead trogs around

  yes folk ive had a busy time since i left eng-
land theyd just sent for you to come over from
paris they shoved a lot of blueprints into my hands
and put me on an air-liner for little old new york
said i wasnt to worry about the chink-they werent
bothering about extradition so long as i made myself

scare it doesnt seem long but weve done a powerful
lot of hustling in the time the whole american nation
sir got to work on those plans of yours and they were
making gas-dispersing guns in a dozen places at once
turning em out ready for use in less than forty-eight
hours

  we tackled the trogs first time outside the ruins
of chicago-some ruins lord-where there was a
big camp of them fifteen airplanes they had there
a lot of our aces went up heavily armed and i had a
couple of dispersers handy on fast motor lorries

  i guess those trogs had the surprise of their lives
that day only four of em troubled to go up to fight
us thinking to polish us all off in no time with a whiff
of gas but our men separated-i had told em the
lesson of gibraltar you bet-and as fast as their gas
shells burst we dispersed the stuff then a few of our
anti-aircrafts got to work and winged two of the hostile
birds one of our chaps rammed a third and the
fourth we riddled with machine-gun fire

  this rattled em some i expect and the whole covey
started up it was too late our fellows had the drop
on them and settled em with a rain of bombs at close
quarters

  it was the surprise element that put paid to their
account-and thats no detraction from the smart work
of the u s airmen either at the end one of the
trogs got clear away and one lame duck fluttered to
the ground and was captured

  we repaired her tried and experimented till we got
the hang of her works put in a wireless and a couple
of good guns and headed direct for this spot after
getting bennetts last message we should have come
anyway even if he we hadnt had urgent orders from
headquarters

  when we arrived and saw a ring of trog vessels
squatting round the top of the shaft and a little cloud
of gas floating about in the crater i can tell you we
were feeling rather peeved

  surprise again the beggars thought we were one
of their own bunch and didnt know any better till we
were right on top of them and our guns began to talk
lord it would have done you good to see the hurry
and scurry but it was no sort of use we were above
them and they couldnt outfly us we smashed up the
lot cleared the gas away and then came down and
smashed ourselves and here we are stuck we could
do no more than radio for help and try to send you
an appeal

  say i felt pretty bad never thought youd get out
again wouldnt get me down there not if you were
to make me a multi-rockefeller no jonas t hop-
kins will die in the fresh air

  general hartopp who had been busy sending and
receiving messages ever since we reached the top broke
in upon his chatter we start for london at the
earliest possible moment gentlemen we take every
care of the king en route a fresh air force will be
here shortly to hold the outlet

  we climbed into our vessel again and began our long
flight rushing north-eastward at the highest speed the
trog vessel was capable of attaining
the world at bay



  of all the reckless ventures we seemed fated to risk
surely this was the most reckless the most utterly rash
consider we were largely ignorant of the mechanics
of the radium engine of our unfamiliar craft we had
no idea how long the supply of power would last of
course our route was already known and aerial and
sea convoys would already be on the way to assist us
over the thousands of miles of land and sea but sup-
posing the power failed while we were over the blue
water 

  we were well out in mid-atlantic temporarily out of
sight of our out-distanced escort when john rixon put
our unspoken fear into words

  it is to be hoped our engine keeps going he said

  the words were scarcely out of his mouth when the
throbbing of the little motor ceased abruptly hori-
zontal and vertical propellers alike came to a standstill
and the deck seemed to drop from under our feet it
was like being in a lift going down

  we were falling into the sea falling like a stone
not a vessel was visible in the circle of angry waters
not a speck of movement disturbed the blue dome of
the sky

routing the troglodytes

u are getting your wish mr hopkins said
   jf john rixon wearily you wanted to die in the
   -i- fresh air

  but not in salt water and not just now he re-
torted we arent done with yet the general is
sos-ing for all hes worth we have to hang on to
the ribs of this contraption as long as shell float im
most worried about his nibs-hes scared stiff look
out everybody hold on

  we didnt need telling we held on grimly enough
dick and hartopp got hold of ul-ulfa while john
rixon and myself prepared to help rita

  even in that infinitesimal space of time all the while
i was conscious of the uprushing waves and the up-
rushing wind bracing myself for the coming moment ofa
shock even then i raged inwardly against john rixon

  why should he be here in such a moment as this
if we were to perish thus why should he share in the
poor consolation of being with rita at the last if
were were to die why could we not die together we
two

  to make it worse i knew that john rixon was
thinking much the same about me-and probably with
far greater right what fools we men are

  and after all there was no need for our precious
heroics petty jealousies and panic fears

  the air-liner that was following caught sight of us
as we fell for she had only just passed out of eyeshot
the moment before she launched the small swift
hydroplane she carried and we were all picked off
safely before the wrecked trog vessel had time to
sink

  that prompt rescue and the evidence of our differ-
ent sorts of sea and aircraft our cool confidence and
the care we took of him did a lot towards bringing
ul-ulfa into a reasonable frame of mind he was
obviously impressed with our capabilities and pleased

with our treatment of himself he was still more
impressed when we took him into london and gave
him a suite of rooms-well guarded of course-in the
new hotel augustus

  the couple of weeks that followed were busy weeks
for us we were all in great demand apart from our
journalistic work as the only four people in the
world who could talk troggese we were told to be
within easy call of the augustus and i was also in con-
stant touch with the electrical experts who were per-
fecting the disperser apparatus

  when we had made a disperser gun small enough to
carry on a fighting aeroplane we felt ready to fight the
trogs on even better terms than we had been doing
and when an american inventor cabled that he had dis-
covered the secret of the paralysis ray and could equip
all our vessels with it we knew that the war was won
that the nightmare horror that had threatened mankind
would soon pass away

  every day came better and better news from the bat-
tle-fronts back towards their first great camp in the
amazon forest the troglodytes were driven america
breathed again south africa was in process of re-
construction by the whites

  our forces now held the top of the outlet and with
the gas bombs found in the nine trog vessels we had
captured were quite able to prevent any further on-
rush but a number of trog prisoners whom we had
brought to london and confronted with their king
were given messages and orders by him and sent down
the shaft

  messengers were also sent to the amazon camp the
last stand of the troglodytes they had about a hun-
dred prisoners of ours there and though they had re-
fused to obey their kings command to surrender our
people hesitated to attack them on account of the
prisoners

  but when in desperation this last handful of foes
began raiding again carrying death and destruction
wantonly over a large area there was nothing to be
done but annihilate them at any cost

  i got the story in a letter from hopkins dated from 
buenos ayres

  ive been in at the death folks we simply had
to clear out that hornets nest they had tasted blood
and got the killing fever i guess they took as much
notice of their crowned head as a tiger would of a rate
collector it was a ding-dong affair while it lasted for
they were desperate-and there were no fewer than
seventeen vessels in their fleet but we had eight air-
ships twenty-five bombers and a dozen aerial craft
specially fitted with gas-dispersers and paralysis tubes
then of course we had plenty of our own sort of guns

  we made that camp look like a volcanic eruption
before we finished and we smashed up every one of
those seventeen ships there was one trog left alive
when wed done youll be seeing him in london
now i expect we were a bit worried about the pris-
oners they had but orders are orders and we neednt
have worried we found theyd all been gassed   

  so thats that you can take it as fact that there
aint a trog left above ground except his nibs or


amazing stories

royal highness and a few others you have collected

  its the trogs underground that worry yours truly
just now dont see exactly what we are going to do
about things seems a sort of stalemate we can hold
the outlet of course but there would always be an
element of danger we aint sure what new deviltries
they may hatch out down there the king seems ok
but will they go on obeying him

  another thing what about the radium and poison
gas ore and the prisoners our folks would like
to get a good few lumps of stuff out before we either
bottle em up or break off negotiations ive heard
whispers-this is strictly private and confidential mind
you-that there are certain parties in gods own coun-
try who would pay several millions for a ton of pure
radium and a few hundred-weights of ready-prepared
radio-engine fuel big men they are so it isnt healthy
to spill the beans well now so long for the moment

  you might tell miss courtney-though i expect its
no blamed use-that im still very much a widower but
quite ready to get into harness again i dont believe
theres her equal in this whole wide world mr max
harding youre a lucky dog

  cryptic to say the least of it that he was a victim
i knew well enough but what did he mean by that
final remark probably nothing after all except that
he envied me my continued association with rita and
all the time i was telling myself that for my own peace
of mind i ought to see less of her

  the very next day i had a telephone call from gen-
eral hartopp

  come over to war office at once weve got to
take his troglodyte majesty back to his own country
bring dick martin along ive already rung up rixon

ul-ulfas farewell

what was the reason of this sudden decision
did it mean another descent into the nether
world i collared dick pushed him into a
taxi and asked him what he thought

  not surprised at all old bean for one thing his
nibs has had the flu so often that i expect hes lost
faith in our medicine men and wants to go back to his
own witch-doctors it was rumored last week that
hed got scarlet fever say max they dont want to
include rita in his guard of honor do they if they
do its you and me to say no to that

  shes the best speaker of troggese of all the lot
of us said i but you havent told me what you
think of this business will they want us to go down
again and if so what are we to do about it

  theyll never get me down again-nor rita if i
can help it asserted dick i may not have a ghost
of a chance of winning her myself- he stopped
looked me in the face and grinned sheepishly ive
let it out now have i  well i dare say you knew you
lucky dog anyhow as i was saying im not going
to let rita courtney be sent down there

  im not too flattered at being called a lucky dog i
muttered i think i know who ought to be eh  oh
never mind old pal at all events im with you rita
isnt going down into the nether world again if we can

help it we must prevent it at any or all costs

  we got our orders at the war office without delay
there had been plenty of international confabbing and
everything was settled

  the trogs had refused to agree to the terms of peace
offered they would not even consider them as long
as we held their king a prisoner

  he had volunteered to return to try to persuade his
people to the wiser course

  he would be sent back to the outlet under suitable
escort which we four in our various capacities as
journalists and interpreters were invited to join he
would be sent down the shaft in a trog vessel manned
entirely by trogs and within a week would send us
an answer confirming or rejecting the terms

  the conditions of peace were harsh but inflexible

  the troglodytes must cease all hostilities they must
send up all prisoners they must pay us a yearly tribute
of radium ore they must lend us their best chemists
and engineers and instruct our people in all their dis-
coveries and inventions their world must be open to
periodic visits by safeguarded parties of our people
the top and bottom of the outlet must be garrisoned
and held by us there must be neither comings nor go-
ings between the two worlds except by special permis-
sion of our general war council

  if the troglodytes refused these conditions or agreed
and broke their agreement afterwards our general war
council would close the outlet after invading their
world disarming them and bringing up the prisoners

  it sounds like a gigantic bluff to me said rixon
as we came away from the meeting and went to make
our arrangements for the following days start i
dont see any invasion being successful why the
trogs could retire for hundreds of miles into their
honeycomb wilderness and fill the cave below the out-
let with such a sea of deadly gas that our folk would
be snuffed out before they could get the dispersing ap-
paratus to work i tell you its sheer bluff

  nevertheless our chaps mean business said har-
topp its all cut and dried the king himself quite
expects it if he cant bring his squat devils imps to
reason suppose miss courtney and yourselves will
all be coming along if i werent married- she
would make a splendid wife for a soldier but some
folks are lucky dogs

  i was really getting fed up with that inane phrase
i did not even reply to the gallant general and
rixon glowering at both of us was equally dumb

  the return to the upper world to the fresh air and
sunlight to his normal work had enabled john rixon
to make a good recovery of health he was almost his
own virile determined self again though everyone
could see that his quite excusable breakdown rankled
he had not really forgiven himself

  across a sunny world that breathed in peace once
more we took ul-ulfa the king of the trogs

  a troglodyte messenger had been sent down the
outlet to herald his return and in the cool of an
amazon dawn we saw him step aboard one of his own
vessels manned by a crew of his own people

when it came to bidding him farewell after all the
the world at bay



official bits were over we found ourselves strangely
moved

  i had never imagined that there would be any pangs
of regret at parting with this squat figure in coarse
garments this white sickly-faced creature who wore
disfiguring dark goggles and shivered at the least
breeze this being who was king of the brutes who
had devastated so much of our world

  yet it was with real regret that we saw him go he
had always been reasonable far in advance of his sub-
jects quick to see to learn to appreciate since his
capture he had come to rely for everything upon us-
upon the only four humans who could talk to him a
bond of pity of sympathy even of liking scarcely re-
alized until this moment had grown around us

  with his clammy misshapen hands he gripped ours
in the way he had learned parting with us gravely
quietly one by one even he i fancied held ritas
hands longer than he held any of ours was he think-
ing of ulla i wonder-lila who had been stolen from
him by luckless ulf

  he stood up as the engine began to throb and spoke

  people of the upper air he said-i am translat-
ing it as nearly as possible into english-people of the
upper air i go back to my defeated race i go to
make peace between your people and my people i go
to tell them that they cannot stand against you i go
to tell them of your numbers of your power of your
determination of the kindness you have shown to me
of the diseases that will come upon them in this upper
world of blazing light and piercing cold

  it may be that the people will not listen to me-
that the stubborn elder councillors will have poisoned
their minds against me i will return within the seven
days with peace if it be possible it may be that i
shall not return it may be that i shall speak in vain
that already another king may rule over my world if
i do not return with the time know that i have failed
that i may have died the death

  people of the upper air farewell

  the vessel rose hovered found position and sank
out of sight into the yawning blackness of the great
shaft

the trust raid

here was now nothing to do but wait

  not one of us wished to return till the decision
was made known so we stayed and investigated
south america our experiences were very enjoyable
as in a troglodyte vessel we soared over the andes
and over the boundless wastes of the amazon hinter-
land we visited the cuzco that mystery city of the
ancient incas and marveled afresh at the daring of
the spanish pioneers who penetrated the country a
mere handful of men and destroyed one of the most
promising civilizations the world has ever seen

  we saw the ruins of the old inca temples and
towns the remnants of their wonderful roads of their
marvelous industry where now a few slave-peons
scratch a precarious living from a bare land thousands
of indians fared well on the produce of their irrigated
soil their terraced hills the spaniards found peru

  an empire run on socialist lines an empire in which
every mans living was guaranteed from birth to death
an empire where poverty was unknown they left it
to become capitalistic republican a land of contrasts

  but of course this has nothing to do with my story
turn up the files of the daily scoop if you want to
know more about our aerial holiday

  we were at lima when the disquieting news came
that made us pack up hurriedly and start back for the
outlet

  it was a brief radiogram from hopkins

  better come over if you want another scoop people

i	mentioned after radium sort of raid hustle

  we got more news on our way back but it was all
very nebulous a party of business men with secre-
taries and hangers-on had arrived at the outlet camp
in a big air-liner they had chartered

  rumors were flying about that they intended trying
to get down into the underworld that they had formed
a syndicate to exploit the radium ore they hoped to
bring up-sensational rumours-but the party affected
to laugh at such ideas

  they were just sightseers they said with a special
permit from washington no need for anybody to
worry

  all the same said rixon i dont like the look of
things they must have a strong pull at headquarters
to be allowed here at all some of those big business
syndicates wont stop at anything look at the chaps
back of the bootleggers its all a question of dollars
with them they would get more power and profit out
of half a ton of radium than out of all the rotten alco-
hol theyve sold in defiance of the liquor laws

  still i dont see how they are going to get away
with it in face of the international force holding the
outlet said dick martin they wont have a chance
to get down and if they get down im sure we shall
nab them when they come up dollars can do a lot i
know but somehow i dont see the worlds general
council knuckling under to a gang of financial bus-
caneers

  dont be too sure dicky put in rita the ex-
ploits of the rum runners in defiance of two govern-
ments ought to prepare us for anything but we shall
soon see for ourselves

  we arrived at the top of the outlet-that strange
area of brown desolation in the steaming green sea
of the amazon jungle-soon after but we did not see
what happened

  we were just too late we heard

  hopkins met us as we stepped to the ground his
face was as long as a fiddle

  theyve done it folks done it right under our
noses gone down after the loot and they mean to
get it too i tell you im ashamed-i jonas t hop-
kins an american citizen - im ashamed of our
country though theres one scottie and one dago in
the bunch

  but did they manage it i asked they came
in an air-liner that wouldnt be any use in the shaft

  they were pretty smart ill allow replied hop-
kins a note of grudging admiration in his voice


amazing stories

  they were a biggish party and the top men the
ringleaders are here yet going around shedding
crocodile tears in floods they never expected any-
thing of the sort of course all the rumors that had
got about were just hot air pulling our legs and so
on i guess they are waiting to see what eventuates
if the raid comes off youll see this lot of surprised
saints as the principal stockholder in the great radium
trust if the thing fails-well of course theyll
calmly disown their poor tools mind you they are
open and above-board theyve told the press that
they are disgusted with governmental leniency and de-
lay  they think the trogs ought to be exterminated and
the underworld thrown open to commercial exploita-
tion

  but how did they get down 

  took us absolutely by surprise late last night we
never expected their move whilst the big-bugs were
having a talkee-talkee in the generals mess-tent the
active members seized one of the trog vessels and just
went one of em it appears had experimented in
the controls of a trog plane captured in mexico
theyre a reckless crush-some of em been in the
bootlegging business and others very talented crooks
and gunmen

  of course directly we saw the plane in the air
we guessed what was wrong but it was too late then
we called to them to stop but they laughed and shouted
that they were going down to see hell for themselves--
going to make it hot for the devils  one of them yelled
-and anybody who tried to stop them would get hurt
somehow they had smuggled a machine gun aboard
as i remarked we were all so paralyzed so absolutely
taken aback that we just did nothing till it was too
late by the time we had gathered our addled wits
they had dropped out of sight down the shaft

  thats eighteen hours ago and weve seen nothing
heard nothing of them

  what is your opinion general asked rita as
hartopp came over to greet us

  orders from the war council are to wait another
day before taking action you see one of the terms
of the armistice was that we were not to make any use
of the shaft or to interfere with the troglodytes in
any way until the expiration of the weeks grace we
had given the king

  this foolish raid may upset everything down there
its damnable

  hartopp was bitterly aggrieved

  and if you hear nothing in twenty-four hours
then ive got to send somebody down to learn
something was his curt reply somebody who can
talk to the trogs

  we four who shared that dangerous accomplishment
glanced uneasily at each other

john rixon decides

o	go down into that awful hole again to re-visit
hat horrible land of gloom 

  i thought i was brave said rita but i cant
i cant face that ghastly world again

  my dear lady said the general i can assure you

that you need have no fear i will see to that nor do
i think it fair to call upon mr martin after the im-
prisonments he suffered there the choice is really
between mr harding and mr rixon there may be
no need to send either of them of course but if the
need arises i shall leave it to them to decide

  i must confess that this very diplomatic speech gave
me a queer sinking sensation in the internal regions
of my anatomy it was too patently indicative it nar-
rowed the choice down so obviously it pointed so
clearly to me

  rita and dick ruled out there was really no choice
left after john rixons noble work for the prisoners
-work that had made him a wreck and had left its
mark on him still-no one could possibly ask him to
imperil himself again to re-visit those harrowing
scenes

  no the choice was no choice at all the finger of
fate pointed to max harding and max harding
didnt like the prospect

  there was even more than that behind hartopps
clever shuffling out of responsibility he knew that
he had no chance with rita himself or only a poor
chance he saw the possibility of eliminating one of his
most dangerous rivals he would not compromise him-
self in her eyes by deliberately appearing to get one
of us out of the way

  i may be wrong in imputing this to the gallant soldier
but instinct is a pretty sure guide in these matters
after all

  anyhow if general hartopp and any other man had
been the only obstacle between rita courtney and my-
self if i had been assured that with them out of the
way she were mine for the asking i would cheerfully
have sent them to the south pole or urged them to
climb mount everest

  you see im brutally candid ive put down just
what i felt at the moment

  of course i said there need be no trouble john
rixon could not be asked and therefore i held myself
at the generals orders should my services be needed

  rita made an impulsive movement bit her lip as
though checking a hasty word and remained silent

  very good of you harding began the general
i always prefer volunteers for the vc jobs

  just a moment said john rixon coolly as mr
hardings senior ive a word to put in

  again rita was about to speak and again she checked
the impulse

  ive something very definite to say rixon went
on if anyone must go down i will go theres no
use discussing it i am quite the best troggese speaker
i have the longest and most useful experience of the
troglodytes and their ways please regard it as
settled

  dont quarrel over it and force a decision upon me
said hartopp clearly annoyed thats all i ask in
any case i shall call upon one of you to-morrow if we
have by then received no news of the raiders

  i protested dick very half-heartedly volunteered but
john rixon was firm

  and when twenty-four hours had passed without a
the world at bay



sign from the nether world it was john rixon who
stepped aboard a trog vessel together with a trog
prisoner to help work it

  he did not seem at all troubled or worried

  i daresay i shall bring them up-the whole thing
will have fizzled out they will have seen enough to
make them give up the mad idea and theyll be glad
to be rescued well good-bye for the present see
you again soon

  he waived his hand cheerfully as the vessel sank
out of sight

  for us left above there was nothing to do but wait
and watch

  the news of the trust raid had flashed around the
world and we lived those two long days of suspense
in constant wireless touch with the general council
the big business men who we were morally sure had
organized the raid were put under arrest but they did
not seem greatly troubled

  its as i told you said hopkins they are really
injured innocents theyll be sure to have left nothing
in writing anywhere and there will be no witnesses
to the verbal instructions given to the poor boobs who
went down to pull the chestnuts out of the fire you
will see the plutocrats are ok

  to anticipate i may as well state here that hopkins
was right no evidence connecting our financier pris-
oners with the raid was ever discovered-at least no
such evidence was ever made public or reported in the
press-and they were eventually set at liberty

  two days after his descent a vessel was heard com-
ing up the shaft and when it reached the top john
rixon stepped out

  his clothes were soiled his hands were grimy a
hideous troglodyte gas mask hung from his neck his
face was haggard

       a new menace

e crowded round him as he stepped to the
ground with a weary gesture he motioned us
away give me a bit of time he said a
wask and brush up and that sort of thing ill talk
later i can tell you this the raiders are wiped out

  we got the full story from him in the generals
mess-tent that evening

  those crooks have not only lost their lives they
have endangered the peace treaty they may cost ul-
ulfa his life they have spoilt everything with their
rapacious commercial greed he said when i got
down the whole underworld was in an uproar it was
like dropping into a wasps nest everywhere the rocks
resounded with signal tappings and the cave-tunnels
roared with the passage of airliners i was surrounded
and seized at once by a lot of very angry trogs i
thought i was done for

  fortunately the king happened along in the nick
of time he had a lot of trouble with his subjects
but managed to persuade them at last that i was merely
a harmless useful messenger quite a lot of them
would cheerfully have shot me out of hand

  when things had calmed down a little i got news
of the raiders it appeared that they had come safely

down the shaft and taken the trogs completely by sur-
prise evidently some member of the party had a keen
nose for details and a retentive mind for they seemed
to know their way about read up all our adventures
carefully i expect

  they flew across the great cavity and along the
passage leading to the underground sea there they
had a snappy fight with a trog plane and sank it then
they flew over the poison gas works dropping a few
high explosive shells and eventually reached the
prisoners camp

  by this time the whole trog world was thoroughly
roused and naturally they were very indignant at what
they could only regard as a breach of faith on our part

  they attacked the raiders in force but were kept
at bay for a long time by the dispersal of the gas they
used the raiders who had brought some machine-
guns along armed a number of prisoners and with
these made an attempt to reach the low levels of the
radium mines im not very clear how far they went
but one thing is certain-not a man of that particular
party returned

  then realizing hastily that they had simply gone
into a trap the remnant of the raiders made a desperate
endeavor to return

  it was of course utterly hopeless

  they managed to cross the sea again but they never
reached the bottom of the outlet when they were
in the narrowest part of a tortuous tunnel-way the
phosphorescent light was quenched in the pitch dark-
ness they ran aground crashing into the rock wall
and there a wave of poison gas caught them shrivelling
them to dried mummies i was taken to the spot and
saw the wreck and the bodies

  had they tried to bring out any of the prisoners 
asked rita

  there wasnt a dead prisoner amongst them they
had tried to save themselves-they left the prisoners
to their fate and from what i heard there are still
some three hundred unhappy souls down there

  cant we do anything to help dick asked

  im really afraid that all we can do for them is-
just nothing was rixons reply nothing that is
except hope for the making of a peace treaty ul-ulfa
is honestly doing his best for a settlement but this raid
has strengthened the hands of the elders considerably

  from merely regarding our humanity as a profit-
able slave supply the militant trogs are now actively
and malignantly hostile they see their dream of con-
quest and survival melting away they see the deadly
mines on which their power depends falling into dis-
use for want of labor they fear the diseases of our
world if they should be compelled to go on fighting us
or we should be allowed to travel down there

  speaking without being a medical authority i
should say the king himself will die of consumption
then what shall we report to headquarters are
the trogs likely to agree to our terms

  general hartopp spoke sharply he sensed as we
had done before when listening to john rixon telling
bad news that there was more behind that the worst
had not been mentioned


amazing stories

  the king has asked for another days grace was
rixons answer

  as a matter of fact he sent me up in a hurry to
obtain that respite as well as to get me out of danger
i only escaped by a miracle the trogs are in open
revolt fighting is going on amongst them and poison
gas flame discharges and nerve paralyzing rays are
making the outlet cave very unhealthy ululfa has
got his back to the wall and personally i think he is a
doomed man i think the elders will win that there
will be no peace treaty

  and then what the general snapped out with
it man

  john rixon had a slightly bewildered air the
gloom and horror of the underworld had shaken him
more than he cared to admit

  i cant tell what we may expect then he said at
length even u ulfa trying to warn me was in-
definite nebulous there were rumors and hints pass-
ing along grunted from trog to trog rapped out on
the walls if the elders won they would make an
end of all trouble they would undo the deed of the
outbreak they had power at command these terrible
wise men of the race such as the people did not under-
stand there were secrets in the deep earth as yet
known but to few and these powers and these secrets
would be used mercilessly the troglodytes would
never be subjects to an alien race

  finally ul-ulfa told me that it would be well for
us to leave the outlet-to return home

  then you think theres some sort of danger here
asked rita thoughtfully

  im sure of it and yet i cant give it a name was
rixons gloomy response i am even more sure of
this we must make our quarters on board the trog
aeroplane so as to be ready for instant flight we had
better go aboard at once you had better get all your
men on their various craft too general

  we shall remain in camp till the time of grace ex-
pires said hartopp somewhat stiffly  i dont see
what can possibly harm us here

  hartopp was a decent man but he had a brass hat
mentality

a world forever sealed

impressed by rixons vague warning perhaps
impressed the more by reason of its vagueness we
four journalists took up our abode on the trog-
lodyte vessel which hartopp placed at our disposal
where hopkins joined us later

  a couple of hours before the armistice was due to
expire driven by an increasing uneasiness we took
the vessel into the air and cruised about back and forth
across the top of the shaft it was a clear sun-
drenched day humidly hot at earth level refreshingly
cool in the higher atmosphere the smoke of the camp
fires and mosquito smudges curled lazily in the air
the great brown broken expanse of the outlet dotted
with its white tents and the twenty grounded air-ships
that had brought the garrison of nearly two hundred
picked men to the spot lay beneath us like a huge deep
basin

  a picture of rest and peace rita was saying and
yet what a picture of past force what a tremendous
volume of energy must have been released to tear out
these square miles of raw earth from the thick forest
and then the work of boring the shaft miles up from
the nether world

  boring the shaft was easy in one way said rixon
i heard about that it was done with a flame dis-
charge such as they use in their once-only pistols a
great stream of released atomic force-a force that
dissolves all solids on contact into invisible vapour-
was directed upwards through the rocks and formed the
long straight round shaft to within a certain distance
of the top for the final burst an explosive more
violent than anything we know had to be used and
then the flame discharge was used again to clear the
shaft of debris

  then the trogs could break out anywhere they darn
well please oh lord groaned hopkins

  not exactly was rixons reassuring reply to
begin with the cave below the outlet happens to be the
very highest point the nearest to the surface in all
their world and in the second place the flame dis-
charge the atomic energy used is so arduous to make
so difficult to handle on such an enormous scale that
it is doubtful whether they could accumulate sufficient
power for a similar feat in a hundred years

  ul-ulfa told me himself that the great project had
been the work of many generations of patient prepara-
tion about the supply of explosive he was not sure
they have plenty of gas at any rate cried dick
suddenly look at the top of the outlet thought
i was mistaken at first but i wasnt coming up
thicker now it will be smoking like a chimney
directly

  volumes of dark vapor were now pouring from the
core of the outlet spreading out in all directions evi-
dently forced up by strong pressure from below

  we immediately trained our dispersing rays upon it
thinning it destroying it but still it poured out in roll-
ing clouds thicker faster seemingly inexhaustible
faster than we could annihilate it that dark cloud grew
spreading out from the centre like a fungus growth

  we signalled the garrison and when their dispersers
got to work we managed to keep the deadly stuff within
reasonable limits still it poured out continuously it
needed all our energies all our resources to hold it in
check

  hartopp will have to evacuate the position after all
im afraid said rixon pity he has turned so stub-
born i dare say he feels that there has been quite
enough civilian advice and interference in this affair

already ah its thinning at last it is getting-

  he never finished that sentence

  the catastrophe burst upon us with terrifying
abruptness with appalling violence

  a torch of fire fierce and glowing even in the sun-
light shot from the top of the outlet had we been
directly in its path our vessel and ourselves would have
vanished like a speck of dust in a candle flame

  it sank then burst out again and just as rixon
pressed the lever that sent our vessel upwards in a
the world at bay



frantic leap for safety the whole vast surface of the
oasis appeared to rise in the air it rushed up to us
a heaving straining conical mountain stretching out
greedy sprays of matter fountains of soil clutching
fingers of hissing flame to seize us to overwhelm us
to drag us down

  it was as though the earth flaming and smoking had
burst open

  the vast area of upheaval sank back as swiftly as it
had arisen the terrible roar of the explosive jarred
every atom of the air shook every plate and bolt on
our vessel tortured our ear-drums into a silence of
exquisite pain

  of the camp and the air-ships of general hartopp
and his garrison not a trace was left amongst the
smoking area of desolation

  then the dust cloud smothered us fast as we were
rising and the sun glowed dimly red through the hot
and gritty swirls of pungent vapor

  another few minutes and we should be out of
this i said choking and coughing even as i spoke
the lifting screws stopped the engine ceased its throb-
bing beat

  the vessel began to fall we were dropping through
that dense sea of dust into that basin of death where
the ruptured earth smoked and reeked with poison
fumes

the bitter hour

we had no time to talk precious little time to
act we hastily put on our masks and braced
ourselves to meet the shock of the coming
crash i do not think one of us expected to live many
moments

  our sudden upward leap at the instant of the great
explosion had put an undue strain on the engine and
the concussion of the upheaval had been the finishing
touch the main gear had broken piercing the lead
sheathing and through the rent the radio-energy had
poured eating a great hole in the vessels side

  we braced ourselves for the inevitable end but to
our surprise we came to rest safely shaken tumbled
bruised but safe the explosion had literally pul-
verised a great area of earth piling it in soft heaps that
were still slipping and slithering to a common level
upon one of these heaps we fell the vessel burying
itself and us

  it was hot uncomfortable frightening but we were
alive unhurt we scrambled out cleared a part of the
ships deck and looked about us

  might have been worse partners said hopkins
cheerfully we ought to have known we should light
on something cushiony we shall all have to die in
our beds of old age-no other way of finishing us
poor old hartopp if he hadnt been so all-fired
mulish a right good guy he was too outside of his
red-tape now for the wireless if thats in order
all we have to do is to send out an sos and wait
for relief

  i fancy we can take off these sickly masks now
said rita the wind is blowing the dust and smoke
away thats better what a scene what a chaos

i should think the force of that upheaval must have
been felt for hundreds of miles and picked up by all
the seismographic stations in the world

  as a matter of fact that was so the concussion
was registered all over the globe and the movements
of the recording stylus on the drums were only pa-
ralleled by the hitherto mysterious earth tremor of
september   that as we now know was
caused by the original outbreak of the trogs

  i think said john rixon trying hard to keep all
trace of emotion out of his voice that we can safely
say the troglodyte menace is at an end this ex-
plosion which has destroyed the outlet shaft and sealed
them up in their gloomy world for ever means that the
elders have triumphed over the king in their fierce
rage against us they have preferred to be forever cut
off from the upper air for they will never make
another sally of that im convinced

  and they know it would be hopeless for we should
be ready for them and could fight them on equal terms
said dick but cant we ever get down are the
prisoners to be left there to be worked to death by
the trogs

  rixon nodded gloomily

  we cant help them not all our scientific skill
could bore a shaft one tenth of that distance down
no we have seen the last of the troglodytes the last
of their world in my opinion long before they have
prepared sufficient radio-energy to cut out the shaft
again they will have perished the prisoners will soon
be used up the disease germs that have been carried
down there will spread rapidly

  it sounds archaic to suggest it now but i really
and truly believe that the troglodytes will die because
of their wrongdoing their sin has found them out
    now what about ourselves

  the wireless seems to function after a fashion
said dick it was fortunate we installed a set on
every captured vessel i hope they come for us soon
im tired of south america home for me

  well we were picked up the next day by an air-
liner and turned our faces homewards

  if we had been important notorious lionized before
we were now painfully popular as journalists we
ought to have been having the time of our lives but
our experiences had shaken us all and there is such
a thing as having a surfeit of success

  the general council dealt most handsomely with
me in the matter of my invention in fact all of us
including jonas p hopkins received very generous
treatment from a grateful world

  but there is really no need to go into all those de-
tails they did not vitally interest me i accepted the
kudos and the cash gladly enough of course but i did
not look upon them as my reward

  my real reward the real joy that alone could make
my nightmare experiences seem really worth while
was something quite different from financial success or
worldly fame

  so with a flower in my buttonhole i sallied forth
to see rita at her dainty little flat one gorgeous sunday
afternoon for we still lingered in london we had


amazing stories

earned our holiday my way lay across the green
park nearly at the further gate i saw a familiar
figure ahead and quickening my pace overtook john
rixon

  he started seemed uneasy walked briskly on

  sorry to scoot off harding fact is im going
to see rita had a note from her last night i know
how you feel so i cant ask you for congrats if all goes
well dont let this come between us though after
what weve all shared together

  we shook hands he hurried off and i dropped into
a seat i sat there a full hour the blackest and most
bitter hour of all my life

i learn the truth at last

i sat there in the gay sunshine a stricken man

i felt as though i had been clubbed into a sort of
sensitive insensibility

  of course i ought to have known i should have
expected this had i not seen john and rita together
often enough had i not had sufficient warning
should i not have been better occupied writing the story
of our adventures or experimenting in my workshop
than sitting in the green park like a moon-struck loon 

  we are not yet so far removed from the primal
beasts from whom we have inherited our clumsy bodies
the ape and tiger are strong in us yet convention
habit the sense of futility kept me sitting there in-
active but in the heart of me i raged with a fierce
passion in my thoughts i murdered john rixon over
and over again

  somebody spoke my name and john rixon stood
before me in some way he had changed within the
hour and yet his face was calm impassive

  ive a message for you harding he said rita
wishes to see you at once she insists on seeing you

  i dont know that i will go said i sullenly you
can tell me yourself cant you

  john rixon hesitated opened his mouth shut it
again with a snap i was turning away when he seized
my arm in a fierce grasp

  harding you will go to her she wishes it she
made me promise to send you she has something to
say to you-something that must be said dont be a
fool man

  he spoke harshly dominantly his will was stronger
than mine

  all right i said ungraciously as you both make
such a point of it ill go though for the life of me

the

i dont see the sense of being so mysterious why not
blurt it out yourself and wait for the hypocritical com-
pliments i should have to throw at you 

  john rixon was about to reply-and once more he
choked back whatever it was he would have said he
smiled a twisted sort of smile turned on his heel with-
out a word and strode off down the sunny path

	   

  rita rose to greet me with a grace of charm and
manner that no other woman i have known possesses

  i shouldnt have come i said if rixon hadnt
been so insistent that you wished it i suppose i have
to congratulate him and wish you every happiness 

  poor old john said rita pensively i knew he
would be coming to see me soon so i sent for him and
we faced the facts-faced them as a modern man and
woman should

   john took it very well he has the finest noblest
character of all the men i know my happiness he
said-and he meant it-was his chief consideration
it hurt me hurt me horribly to tell him the truth
was i hearing aright

  you mean-

  i mean dear max that i had to hurt poor john
i told him that i admired him respected him even
loved him in a way but that i loved someone else such
a lot more and in such a different way

  then-rita-dearest rita-you sent for me to
tell me this 

  because you wouldnt come and ask me you old
stupid couldnt you see that good old john was so
much of a friend of a pal that he could never be
anything else did you ever hear of eyes and no
eyes  did-did-

  and yet said i mockingly i am stupid slow
and shortsighted whilst john rixon has the finest
noblest character of all the men you know

   but then max i dont love you for your character
you are very ordinary and full of faults i love you
just because you are you

  the world has seemed a fairer place and life has
been well worth living since rita courtney shared her
destiny with mine from the beginning it must have
been decreed that we should come together we two
and if it be true that life is eternal that there is no
death then we two shall assuredly go forward-
always together

jffe have published many four dimensional stories
 both in the quarterly and the monthly but we un-
hesitatingly state that the present story is without ex-
ception the best one we have ever published along these
lines

  this is the sort of story you will read and re-read dur-
ing the months to come and you will never get quite
enough of it and what is more this is a story that will
make you think

  every high school and every physics teacher and pro-

fessor will wish his class to read this story due to the
most excellent astronomical data contained in it this
story not only contains excellent astronomy but excellent
physics as well

  the theme is as good or even better than jules vernes
famous classic around the world in eighteen days
indeed it parallels that story in cleverness and in the
same sort of unusual clever ending

  in addition to all of this it is an unusually good inter-
planetarian story and we know that it will be joyfully
received by every scientifiction fan

          jhy this has happened before i cried as
          i poured my husband a third cup of coffee

             john laid down the morning paper and
          shrieked with laughter

               ill say it has and its liable to happen
again tomorrow morning

did you ever know me to	

drink fewer than three cups
of coffee at breakfast

ellen

oh you dont know
what i mean i responded
a trifle irritably i have
reference to that feeling
that we all have occasion-
ally that the identical set
of circumstances that sur-
round us has existed before
in some remote eon of
time

fiddlesticks ejaculated

tlf hat makes a premonition it seems to be a proven
fact that some people some time have a feeling of
dread of an event about to occur which they themselves
cannot explain

  very frequently also it happens that one has the impres-
sion that some time in the dim past there was a similar oc-
currence it happens to many of us ivhen we visit a strange
place that we positively know we have never seen before or
have never been near yet we feel that we know it quite
intimately and there is something about it that makes it
quite familiar to us

  what brings all this about what is the answer to those
most puzzling phenomena

  our well-known author advances an ingenious theory on
the subject in the present story

john as he set down his empty coffee cup and folded
his napkin im going to get my car started as it
takes so long these cold mornings

  in which unsympathetic mood he donned hat and
overcoat and disappeared through the kitchen door a
second later his head was thrust through the reopened
door and a jovial smile spread over his features

  say ellen it strikes me
as i go out to get the old
bus that this has happened
before he called back to
me

  something else will
strike you i cried play-
fully picking up an empty
cup

  he dodged in mock con-
sternation then his face
grew earnest

  but seriously my dear

amazing stories

migration surely you dont think your personality
has been previously decked in other corporeal trappings
do you

  no i replied i do not believe that i have al-
ways been myself and you will always be yourself
stubborn as ever my explanation of the oft re-
peated phenomenon that my life has been lived before
exactly as i live it now lies solely in the theory that
time which is the fourth dimension is like space curved
and travels in great cycles you cannot conceive of
either the end of space or time the law of the uni-
verse as illustrated by the movements of the stars and
planets and the endless motion of the molecules and
atoms and the whirling of the electrons proves that
orbital motion is a cosmic law and that all things
return eventually to their starting point and so in
the vast cycles of time and space we repeat our exis-
tence upon this earth and i claim that occasionally a
fleeting memory of previous cycles thrusts itself into
our consciousness

  too deep for me said john with a shrug i must
get down to the office and by the way an apple pie
for dinner tonight would be greatly appreciated i
havent had any for a long time

  do you like my apple pies john i asked smiling
do i you are an expert at it i suppose he
added as he all but disappeared through the crack of
the door as it stood slightly ajar the infinite number
of times that you have baked apple pies in previous
cycles of existence has made you adept in that line
the door closed and he was gone

  dear john of course he understood the theory as
well as i did but he was forced out among associates in
the business world and it was essential that his mind
be continually occupied with the practical affairs of
life dreamers might be vouchsafed glimpses of the
truth but did such visions always prove beneficial
there was no doubting that john was a greater success
in life than i whether he grasped the significance of
certain cosmic truths or not

  after all i mused the difference between the
great and the small the infinite and the finite right
and wrong good and evil is sometimes one of degree
and not of quality the most difficult is simple if
we follow the rules the people who make a muddle
of their lives have deliberately though unknowingly
chosen the harder way they are law-breakers not
necessarily in our legal sense but they are transgres-
sors of universal law had they simply worked in
harmony with the law success would have come
easily

  i have not always worked in harmony with the
law i thought none of us have do i now in this
cycle of time possess the ability to change errors per-
formed in previous eons or am i a mere puppet des-
tined to a certain definite course of action throughout
eternity was henley right or wrong when he wrote
i am the master of my fate the captain of my soul
i believed in the cycle theory of time and yet in it

i	saw no hope for changing the errors of the past
my theory was a death-blow to progress and evolution

i had just slipped my last pie into the oven and
glanced casually out of the kitchen window when
i spied my neighbor mrs maxwell on her cinder
path between her house and the garage suddenly i
had the same sensation that i had experienced at break-
fast this has happened before i know it

  then like a flash before a seeming darkness obliter-
ated my fleeting memory came the warning to my
consciousness that mrs maxwell ought not to enter
her garage i took a step toward the door with the
intention of calling to mrs maxwell there was plenty
of time the path was long and she was not a third of
the way to the garage i watched her my heart thump-
ing wildly she had stopped to pick up a scrap of
paper i took another step toward the door then
paused

  oh whats the use i argued shed think i was
crazy to run out there and attempt to keep her from
her errand to her garage i wonder why i have had
two sensations of this memory enigma today often
they are weeks even months apart

  resolutely i turned and left the kitchen intending
to finish my remaining housework i reached the first
landing of the stairs when the sound of an explosion
that rocked the house to its foundation caused me to
start in wild-eyed terror in a panic of fearful pre-
monition i rushed to a south window the maxwell
garage was a mass of roaring flames

  it is fate fate i groaned in my anguish there
is no hope we mortals cannot escape the cycles of
time like the wheels of the ancient juggernaut ruth-
lessly grind us to our destruction and there is no hope
it seemed that for months after mrs maxwells
funeral i could not rise above a sense of despondency
a hopelessness was ever present in my consciousness
and nothing i did seemed worth the effort finally
realizing that my present mental state must not con-
tinue i plunged into domestic and social duties with
a vim that was most unusual for me

  not once during many months following the maxwell
tragedy had i experienced a single recurrence of my
unaccountable memory flashes then one day the sen-
sation returned

john was ready to make a business trip to the
south and had purchased his railroad ticket early in
the afternoon the train was scheduled to leave
town at  p m the supper dishes had just been
cleared away and john had hurried upstairs to pack his
grip when the feeling that this had all happened before
came upon me-more realistically than i had ever before
experienced it and this time it was accompanied by a
premonition of the same nature as that which had
warned me of mrs maxwells fatal trip to her garage

  i lost no time in hurrying up to johns room where
i found him sorting over the things to take with him
on his trip

  john dont go this evening i said trying to keep
my voice steady there is a morning train at

cant you taxe that instead of going tonight

  my husband carefully tucked his hair brush into
his satchel and for a moment deigned me no reply

  im afraid to have you go tonight john i con-
tinued ive had a-a-sort of warning you know
what i mean

  john closed and locked his grip are you afraid
here alone  he asked after what seemed an intermin-
able silence

  no its not for myself that i fear danger but
for you wont you defer your trip i persisted

  now see here ellen john responded with a show
of irritation ive already bought my ticket and laid
my plans for meeting hopkins in atlanta on friday
and i cant and wont stop because of some fool no-
tion of yours i had supposed you had forgotten about
this fourth dimension time-cycle business he picked
up his satchel but whether youve forgotten it or
not the  sees me ensconced on my way to georgia
but john dear i cried in desperation remem-
ber the maxwell affair if i had only obeyed my im-
pulse to rush out and warn poor mrs maxwell she
would be living now

  john paused and looked at me as if considering but
it was only for a second then he resumed his descent
of the stairs

  no he said ive got to be in atlanta on friday
or stand a chance of losing one of the biggest orders
weve had in months

  then it seemed as though something snapped in my
brain and i heard my voice as though it were anothers
coming from a distance the juggernaut fate grinds
mortals beneath its wheels and there is no hope

  i soon became conscious of the fact that i was sob-
bing hysterically and that john was holding me in his
arms

  ellen ellen his dear voice was saying im go-
ing to fool fate a trick and let hopkins wait i leave
tomorrow at  lets see whats on the radio for
the rest of the evening

  i gazed up at him with incredulity oh john i
cried ecstatically do you think we can prove that
the cycles of time are not inexorable

  we can at least give the theory a fair trial he said
smiling

iv

 poured john his third cup of coffee but did
not feel that it had happened before a mild
thump on the front porch informed me that the
morning paper had arrived i brought it in and laid
it in front of john then i fled to the kitchen where
the odor of burning toast apprised me of the fact that
i was much needed returning with the scraped toast
i seated myself opposite john for the purpose of re-
suming my breakfast

  what news i asked casually

  for answer john handed me the paper and pointed
mutely to an enormous headline his face was ashen
and his hand trembled

  with a sinking sensation i read the large letters
head-on collision demolishes engines and cars and
kills  persons

  john i gasped is it-was it-the 

  his voice was husky with pent emotion

  ellen it was the  and i have been on it in the
other cycles of time i know it now

  i gazed at him incredulously for a moment and then
half in fun half seriously i said john you are now
living on borrowed time

  he smiled a little wanly

  not exactly that dear he said but my mind has
been doing some rapid thinking since i saw those head-
lines and i believe i have a solution to your ever-
puzzling problem of the fourth dimension time

if you can prove my time-cycles are not incompatible
with progress evolution and growth i cried eagerly
you will make me the happiest woman on earth
wouldnt a new fur coat delight you more he
asked teasingly

  well that would help some i admitted but tell
me what makes you believe that evolution and progress
are fact despite the eon-worn ruts of the cycles of
time

  the fifth dimension i echoed puzzled

which is simply this ellen there is a general
progression of the universe over and above the cycles
of time which renders each cycle a little in advance of

foreword

  in reading this most amazing yet truthful story
please remember that i am not a trained writer i
am only a tunnel and mine-worker and ive written
down the things as ive seen them therefore kindly
excuse my english as well as grammar as i am aware
that neither is perfect

i

p on a certain job they were putting a tun-
nel through a granite mountain it was
a big job and they were working day and
night they had cut through a vein of
water a vein of onyx and a vein of silver
the silver especially was particularly beautiful being
in the spreading-out branched form of an immense tree

  however the lead was not followed for the tunnel
was a power tunnel designed to hold water and as
time was a big factor and the expense of the project
was colossal such by-plays as silver mines were unim-
portant besides it was the expert opinion that the
silver tree in the tunnel was a mere pocket

  but they did strike something in that mountain that
was no by-play it was neither gold nor diamonds
though in the opinion of a certain professor it was a
more remarkable find than either and it halted the
tunnel advance for three shifts day and night what
then was the find a find which made tunnel no  in
bald mountain so celebrated

let us review the affair

as i have remarked they
worked two shifts a day
and a night one this left
an interval between as the
shifts were eight hours
each this interval was
split into two parts for a
purpose one part being al-
lotted to each shift drill-
ing as they did during the
working hours and putting in the charges just before
quitting time it was customary for the shift boss of
the retiring shift to set off all the explosions he had
arranged immediately after work this left a period
for the air to clear before another shift came on

  of course it was necessary to keep an accurate count
on the shots heard otherwise the next shift going in
was in danger of their lives thats why the shooting
was allotted to the shift bosses even with such pre-
cautions it was not always possible to be certain of the
tabulation for in spite of efforts to prevent it two
shots sometimes came at the same time a very loud

blast was occasionally put down as two shots but this
was mere guess work and when lives depended on it
it was the worst of judgment to come to such a con-
clusion

  there are persons of the opinion however that the
explosion which wrecked tunnel no  was not
due to an unexploded shot how else then do they
explain it they claim there was some kind of an-
explosive in the chamber which was revealed by the
blast

  however let us observe the shift working at the time
of the explosion and see what we may see this par-
ticular night dan parker was the shift boss daley
of the day gang had reported all ok so parker and
his crew rode into the tunnel with no apprehension
whatever

  this fellow parker was a red-faced man jovial
puffy and fat he wheezed continually as if he had
the asthma claimed he got it from being gassed in
the world war he was a good shift boss tolerant
resourceful and good-natured

  this night there was a fellow named reno bob
as one of the miners they worked three miners with
each shift each miner having a helper then too
there was a crowd of muckers fellows who shoveled
up the mud dirt and rock into the miniature train which
hauled out the debris

  reno was not a regular night-shift man he belong-
ed to daleys gang but a rock had fallen on one
of the miners and the management wishing to lose no
time and expecting a new
man every minute had
shifted bob over to park-
ers crowd

  this reno bob was built
like hercules he had a
dark saturnine face and
coal black eyes a very devil
of a handsome fellow he
was not especially pleased
to hear he was put on the
night shift for he had been in the habit of taking mrs
parker dans wife to the movies down at the pavilion
in the evening and this change would cut him out of
such diversion however this was not unknown to
dan reno was a welcome visitor to the parker home
whether he worked days or nights being a great friend
of the night shift boss

  mrs parker was a very pretty woman with a flood
of yellow hair and fascinating green eyes no one
would have ever thought her likeness was behind that
thin stone wall which parker and reno bob faced when
they came on shift that fatal night but so it was

    ur new author has the easy facility of the teller of
 tales of old coffee house and sailor inn charm and fresh-
 ness which characterizes this tale we know practically
 nothing about the pre-record day civilisations what did
 the people in the days of the aramaic language- years
 before the christian era-use instead of steel and marble
 there seems to us to be no good reason why our authors
 conception should not be plausible at any rate the story
 offers food for thought as well as enjoyment


out  the flooi o the room on powerful springs arose two caskets  in each of the caskets which were supported on golden-
onyx pedestals of carved mammoths lying in repose in elaborate costumes were two figures




amazing stories

  the story is almost unbelievable for weirdness talk
about king tut and his tomb his place wasnt in it
with what they found up on the bald king mountain
and so many things happened afterward that couldnt
be explained by any modern methods but i antici-
pate my story

  you see the watchman at the tunnel mouth always
gave the new shift coming on the result of the last
bosss tabulation this night he merely said every-
thing to the good now if daley had missed a count
he should have said so no one would have blamed
him for that thats merely human nature not always
to be sure anyhow daley had orders to report so if
he hadnt caught a full count and he certainly failed
to carry out orders

the new shift rode to their working place in a
long string of dinkey cars run by a fellow whose
long legs were nearly in his face as he drove the tiny
electric locomotive which pulled the train this fel-
lows name was mai probably an abbreviation for
matthew but he is of no interest in the story any-
body else could have pulled the train i know i could

  they came to the place which halted them the place
where the fallen wall-surface was piled up on the tracks
of course the muckers all had high hip boots so had
the miners they had to have there was water in
the tunnel no river of water but great drops which
oozed languidly out and the floor was as slippery
as the devil

  the night crew jumped from the cars-not care-
lessly but with one hand on the side otherwise hes
liable to be on his seat in the mud sprawled out and
slightly damp to the skin for the place was usually
sopping wet it was a humid stifling place to work in
in spite of a ventilating fan which theoretically cleared
away the foul air

  but the muckers began shoveling not briskly and as
if their lives depended on it but with the measured ease
of men accustomed to the shovel and also to mines
a stroke about half between that of a harp and a
mexican still they had mexicans working here too
but they were not like the ones i refer to

  so the miners set their jack-hammers and began
pounding into solid rock ever see a jack-hammer
well its like a long drill much larger of course than
what a dentist uses its worked the same both of them
use electricity but the jack-hammer gets his from
a longer distance still i dont know maybe the
power the dentist uses comes from the same mountain

  the muckers had cleared away most of the fallen
matter and the jack-hammers had drilled one or
two holes already it seems dan parker had stopped
by reno to ask him about the show down at the pavil-
ion he says so himself and its reasonable it
isnt reno tells it renos gone flooey

  parker says he had just shouted in renos ear about
the show heard reno reply something about loves
reward-that was the show you see-and had just
turned away when the blast came it must have been

  an irishman

renos jack-hammer for hes the only one went flooey
besides any other man who had drilled into dynamite
would have known it shocks like that aint forgotten
well the blast caught them all there was a mess
i tell you in that tunnel i wasnt there myself but
i heard jonny tinker tell what he saw jonny said
it was worsen a plane-bomb in the world war jonny
was in that war so he ought to know

  well there was that blast the train driver mat
you recall who was just running a string of loaded
cars out caught the sound at the tunnels mouth and
he had an inkling of what it meant he shifted his
string caught up a bunch of empties took on the
watchman and raced into the tunnel

  but he had to stop before he came to the place
there was some kind of an odor neither of them ever
smelt before this odor made the air almost impos-
sible to breathe they had to come out again

  by this time there was a crowd of men about the
entrance you see they never shot their blasts off
at night it was always morning when the night crowd
came off shift so anyone who heard the blast on
that particular night knew something unusual had
happened

  seeing that mat and the watchman were stopped by
foul air the emergency apparatus was brought out
and several of the men being rigged up mat forever
lost his chance to see the result of the explosion for
charlie bates took his place

  of course the lights were put out of commission by
this shock werent usually though which only goes
to show it was no ordinary blast so they had to take
in torches you know the kind they call them car-
bide  fill them with a white powder and run in water
then they light a little hole where the gas comes
through theyre not bad lights

  when they got up to the wreckage they found only
debris and darkness flashing their torches toward
the wall they were cutting through they saw a great
jagged hole exposed by the blast going into a cavity
but although this surprised them they were not there
to explore cavities they were there to save lives and
they got to work looking for the missing men

  one by one they pulled them out four of them
were dead and one man was permanently locoed that
was reno i guess anybody would have been locoed
who ran into a similar bit of shaking up i know i
wouldnt want to the rest of the night crew were
ok they were unconscious for a time but they
came around nicely harry getz says he dreamed of
chasing ostriches down in south africa if he did
ill bet he never caught any of them for harry is too
slow even to catch a cold

  well they knocked off work for the day let the
air in for the tunnel to ooze off its poisonous fumes
next night they went in again not the regular crew
remember men aint no fools most of the regular
crew who were capable of moving on their legs were
down the hill by this time youd be surprised the way
a few dead men will change the working crew of a
mine but it does

  parker still was along however when a mans mar-
before the ice age



ried he cant just go and jump his job because of some
unexpected explosion the job of supporting a family
is a more serious affair often than even tnt blasts
and you know theyre some blasts

ii

they came to the ragged hole they poked in
their torches finally parker who was a brave
man being as he was in the world war went
into the cavern and explored he came back and his
face was white

  for gods sake said he to dick combs come
in here and see if you see what i see

  in the cavern in which parker and combs found
themselves was a heap of skeletons clustered near a
peculiar wonderfully-embossed little bronze box the
lid of which had been broken open probably by the ex-
plosion this lid had a tiny hole the mouth of an
octopus head with which it was adorned

  the cavern curved away from the line toward which
the tunnel was being driven so that work was only
temporarily halted because of the find but at the
other end along a walk of leopard-spotted agate was
a figure in mosaic which held them spell-bound it
was of heroic size and seemed to represent a womans
head on an immense snails shell the womans eyes
were large rubies and her head-dress somewhat like
the grecian statues of their goddesses was a helmet
made up of innumerable flakes of moonstone the
womans face seemed remarkably life-like colored as
it was with some shining enamel which seemed to
match the glow of health

  dick combs said it was enough to startle one the
head standing out as it did away from the wall and
seeming so real but what was the explanation of
the skeletons  no one could guess it seemed a mys-
tery beyond the knowledge of simple miners and those
who know even less than miners the weak-headed
muckers

  parker and combs returned and work was resumed
however work was immediately halted when dan went
to the mouth of the tunnel and telephoned headquar-
ters thats where they showed good sense howd
they know but it might be something of great impor-
tance old addington the sup certainly deserved
credit for stopping work till some of those university
guys had a peep remember this was in a solid moun-
tain and heaven knows how long it might have been
there

  professor eddy came down he seemed like a very
capable man to us people whose only glimpse of edu-
cation is the schoolmarm up at no  and the parson
at no  he could talk about eocene and pleocene till
he had us all woosy ive studied a few of the cenes
myself being interested in geology but i never had
any pleosaurius or broncosaurus eating out of my hand
like that guy had he knew everything that was to
be known and some which wasnt

  well he went up to the hole in the tunnel wall gave
a look at the snail-lady and gasped even his expert
knowledge of such things failed to classify her he
was flabbergasted he was nonplussed he was abso-

lutely speechless something queer in a professor

  he sent for a crony of his back at the big school
where they both taught and there never before was
such english used as these two delvers-in-the-ground
used when they looked in the place exposed by renos
shell

  professor eddy explained the pile of skeletons in
the old cavern in front of the snail-lady as persons
sacrificed to her then professor monk took a peep
at the little bronze box and allowed his colleague had a
shot of dope he said the box is in ancient aramaic
and the inscription thereon says that it contains a vola-
tile poison which shall guard the inner chamber ever
from profanation

  professor eddy says how does it come we are
here 

  this of course was a poser for the man who read
aramaic but some of the boys came to the fellows
assistance and told of the terrible smell immediately
after the explosion

  that explains it perfectly contended monk this
was a protection against vandals only till an explosion
occurred it was a very delicate apparatus probably
an invention which has never since appeared on the
earth and the blast broke the small-quantity libera-
tion of the gases and made the poisonous odor which
was remarked just after the catastrophe

  i must say monk reasoned much better than his
name sounded then the two savants went back and
looked at the snail-lady

  what do you make out of it  asked eddy

  it represents patience was the reply

  that fellow monk was always good at replies he
seemed to have accumulated a lot of sense with his
years

  however professor eddy didnt quite like the in-
terpretation of his colleague your mistake is natu-
ral he said

  i dont acknowledge i have made one-yet re-
plied the redoubtable monk

  then i will show you remarked professor eddy
your solution is merely a superficial observation if
you study the hybrids form closely you will find the
snail shell is not a snail shell but the shell of the
nautilus now the nautilus from earliest times has
symbolized a rising spiritually this figure faces a
death-chamber because the womans head on the nau-
tilus shell symbolizes resurrection am i right my
dear professor

doctor monk admitted that should excavation
disclose another chamber behind professor
eddys theory might be the correct one what is
your theory for the reason such a high spot was
selected for the tomb asked he then with the look
of a man who has propounded a poser

  high spots were the sacred ones answered eddy
the learned easily and as if he had instantaneously
solved it

  doctor monk shook his head do you know why
this place is where it is

  not if my theory does not suffice


amazing stories

  it is where it is because of a catastrophe it was
that is the mountain of a much lower elevation-it
may even have been only a hill-but some incompre-
hensible power lifted it to its present eminence

  what is your proof  asked the other doubtfully

  this and professor monk exhibited a small
whirled shell in the palm of his hand which he called
a whelk

  whered you get this  asked doctor eddy and
what does it signify

  i got it on the mountainside half a mile down
dug it out of a lime bed and it signifies that the
place where it came from was at one time under
water

  but how do you know that wasnt before this
place was used as a sepulchre

  because answered professor monk the little
bronze box there refers to this sacred tomb guarded
by the volatile poison as an island

  i dont doubt you remarked doctor eddy but i
wish i read aramaic also

  that wish is only natural but surely you dont in
the slightest way question my reading my dear pro-
fessor

  not at all your reading is eminently reassuring
to me but to the public you must remember two
savants reading would be conclusive

iii

shovels and picks were brought up and a
certain number of laborers supplied to the two
professors i had been assigned to them from
the first thats why i can relate so much of their
conversation they interested me and they were worth
listening to

  the whole figure of the snail-lady was carefully re-
moved from the wall so that it could be reconstructed
in a museum and it was found to be only a veneer
put up in flakes on a suitably chiseled out place in the
solid rock all of the pieces were said by the profes-
sors to be semi-precious stones of course to the aver-
age mine-worker this meant nothing at all even the
most experienced were merely familiar with quartz
granite limestone and the various ores while the
muckers knew nothing some of them disputed things
accepted as true for the last half dozen centuries

  now the door or what they believed was the door
was found to be in the shape of a truncated pyramid
thats what professor monk called it and doctor
eddy gave it as his opinion that it could not be bat-
tered in because the inside was smaller than the out-
side dick grebs who was a miner temporarily loaned
to the university guys was for drilling a hole and put-
ting in a light charge of dynamite but both the doc-
tors vetoed this move no telling whats inside they
said

  so instead of a shot being fired a hole was drilled
clean through the door do you know that door was
 foot thick well it was we measured it after
the hole was drilled a stick was gotten the same size
as the hole pete miller went out and got it they
were near the west entrance here an entrance drilled

for air and pete says he had to climb a tree to get it

  then they made little holes at the end of the stick
and put in little springs which would be compressed
to fit the hole but which would spring out as soon as
they got on the other side of the door and so give us
a leverage it worked all right five of the boys
removed the door easily

  the air inside nearly blew out our lamps we had
to wait an hour before we could enter i didnt care
you see i got paid just the same our time went
on we werent hired by the profs we were merely
loaned to them well we hung around the west en-
trance it was no entrance at all as i told you but an
air shaft all that time and then professor eddy test-
ing the air said it was ok so we trails in

  there was a sight in that room almost made my
heart stand still with wonder a lamp in the shape
of an icicle with a beautiful blue globe hung from the
ceiling and it gave a brilliant and weirdly-penetrating
light

  the first thing which struck us as strange was the
appearance of a man a big-muscled fellow a fellow
even larger and more powerful than reno bob stand-
ing to the north at a niche in the wall we couldnt
mistake this for there were lights back of the fellow
so that he shone vividly before us he was a real
man he held toward us menacingly a black tube of
five barrels which had a curious arrangement at the
other end as if it might be some kind of a gun

  now everybody saw this all the boys and the two
professors we just looked at the fellow and gasped
as one would do who came on a live man in a tomb
the next moment we looked and the fellow was gone
we went over to the wall and looked at the niche and
there was none there instead there was a plate of
what seemed like frosted glass

  now did you ever hear anything like that a man
standing life-like before you to disappear while you
looked professor monk cried to the doctor did
you notice his classification he is pre-glacial

  what gave you such conclusion asked the other
doubtingly

  his robe it was made of mammoth hair

  but was it a man demanded eddy

  it may only be some kind of a projection some
method of throwing up on an apparently blank sur-
face some image of something maybe we stepped on
something which caused the thing to appear

  so we had to trail out again and practise over our
entrance to the place no use we couldnt tramp
exactly right it seemed we never saw the pre-glacial
man again

  but say you ought to have seen that wall it was
made up of an infinite number of squares so that the
roof was neither round nor square but a kind of a
compromise between and on the walls there were
pithons and dinosaurs in wondrous color together
with gorgeous butterflies much larger than any now
known and a funny bird which doctor eddy an-
nounced as a near relative of the pterodactyl it
was quite a funny looking bird only the pterodactyl
was not a bird but a flying saurian reptile-editor
before the ice age



  then our attention being attracted to a great golden
lizard-he must have been the god of all lizards for
he was colored like it-had fire in his mouth a great
golden head flakes of blue scarlet and orange on his
back which seemed outlined on what appeared to be
a row of shells around the whole room

professor monk looked at an inscription
took down what seemed like a piece of cardboard
and we all looked it was light and you couldnt see
through it and it seemed like some kind of a chart
in fact in red outlines on a dull gray surface were
some maps of something but i never saw such maps
there isnt anything on the earths surface now like
those maps showed they were awfully funny

  but professor monk gave an exclamation as if the
source of life were discovered then he cried the
land surface of terra firma before the last glacial
epoch

  but somebody trod on something which nearly gave
us heart failure out of the floor of the room on
powerful springs arose two caskets pete miller was
bowled clean over by one of them but nobody
laughed it was too solemn a sight in each of the
caskets which were supported on golden-onyx pedes-
tals of carved mammoths lying in repose not a hue
different from in life in elaborate costumes were two
figures the one on the right was that of a woman
strange to relate too it had a similar appearance to
dan parkers wife now dont get me wrong theres
nothing at all to this likeness save what some fools
like to give it there were people who werent friendly
to dan or to reno who would like to infer that reno
wasnt just what he should have been because some
idiot noticed that one of the figures resembled the lady
in the parker home but i who saw the caskets
say they dont know what theyre talking about it
was only a distant likeness the woman lying in that
room had a long-drawn face-dolichocephalic i think
the professors called it-and her eyes were wonder-
fully formed even when closed-like an angels it
seemed to me

  whereas the man was dark and ferocious looking
he had a moustache somewhat like the norsemen and
his body was encased in what looked like silver mail
but not in plates rather it was like fine chain closely
woven together on his head was a gold crown of
filigree gold-work the thing being a continuous circle
of heads of the mammoth

  the woman had on a dress of such fine texture that
her body could be seen through it it looked as if
made from spiders silk maybe in the period when
she lived they paid more attention to spiders and had
developed them to a greater degree than any living
spiders these days her feet were clad in moccasins of
rattlesnake skin while the tiara-i thought it was a
crown but the professors called it a tiara-was of
gold filigree work representing a circlet of butterflies
large sapphires being the wings and making them blue
butterflies

  but this was not all

  there were ten little gold boxes arranged in a circle

around the room standing on pedestals of white mar-
ble the slabs under the little gold boxes differing and
being semi-precious stones like sagenite jade moon-
stone sardonyx bloodstone and stones even the pro-
fessors could not recognize

  what these boxes were nobody knew they had a
little peep-hole and a glass somewhat like a lens in-
side while behind was another glass piece which seemed
frosted but there was only darkness when one looked
in these boxes the professors puzzled their heads in
vain but could not make out what these boxes were
it was plain they were something important or they
would not have been arranged with such care or been
around adorning as it were a king and queen

  professor eddy stood at the casket of the queen
studying the lace collar she wore an exquisite thing
made almost of thistle-down it seemed when he gave
a little cry of surprise

  what is it asked doctor monk

  the secret of the boxes

  where

  on the floor here

  professor monk looked and saw a number of golden
squares arranged in a mosaic around a central dove
i dont see the secret he confessed explain it

  the other pointed to the floor and said notice
the dove is in the shape of a turn-button

  what of that demanded doctor monk incom-
prehensively

  turn it suggested the other

  monk did so there was the instant shining of
light seen in the little gold boxes each of us the
professors as well as the workmen selected a box
and looked in in that tiny box in each of them in
fact was an inner eight-sided wheel each side of
which contained a picture which the front lens made
real of some grand scene of the recumbent monarchs
reign now dont get the idea it was like present-day
moving pictures it was far more natural it was so
made that not only were the scenes in their exact
colors but there was also some arrangement by means
of which the figures seemed to stand out like in real
life instead of being flat like moving pictures are
here they had some knowledge which the present-day
moving picture industry would have given thousands
of dollars to obtain and they had it maybe ten thou-
sand years ago

but the thing which excited professor monk most
was a fantastic bronze-colored box set on a shelf
at the feet of the caskets it had in it little plates of
some light material the surface of the plates contain-
ing little squares maybe half an inch each and a quarter
inch apart twelve of these plates had a ring through
corners at top and bottom uniting the plates monk
looked at these through a magnifying glass and uttered
an exclamation

  what is it asked his friend

  the history of the world ten thousand years ago

you dont mean it cried eddy his face filled with
joy now i must study aramaic i know i must

y george melociai

author of smoke-rings

hn nally known to the american
press as a globe trotter and author scowled
into the heavy mist that hung low and con-
cealing over the waters of puget sound
delayed by a broken power line his train
had pulled into seattle hours after the boat to nome
had sailed he lingered on the dock undecided what
next to do the next ship he had been informed by
the ticket agent would not leave until the end of the
week and to attempt to connect with the boat by
plane was hazardous in this fog he sighed resignedly
yes there were no two ways about it he might as well
go back to new york and begin anew this very inter-
esting game of racing around the globe against time-
unhurried tireless unrelenting time-had its constant
worry could he hasten along j ust a little ahead so that
he could anticipate the next move with a single slip
such as had occurred now on any one of the many
legs the whole schedule on which one had spent months
preparing was balled up into a snarl that called for
heroic measures to hold it or eventually would force
a new start

  he was about to leave the dock when a tall well-
dressed stranger accosted him with i understand
sir from your conversation with the clerk that you
have missed your boat i suppose you know there is
a railroad to alaska in fact
to nome

  huh grunted nally
a trifle surprised at the an-
nouncement he laughed

that railroad why its
tracks are under mountains
of snow

  so they are agreed the
stranger his eyes twinkling
with amusement at nallys
evident surprise a rail-
road is in operation should
you motor to mono city
a tough drive of forty miles northeast you can connect
with this railroad and thus arrive at your destination
several days ahead of the boat

nallys eyes narrowed see here if you think
you can make me swallow that youre badly mistaken
im sorry sir but i can declared the stranger
handing a small card to nally who stared at it he
had doubted the word of the british consul at seattle

  pardon me sir began nally lamely scratching the
back of his head with his free hand

  i understand sir i know its hard to believe what

others tell us when we think we know better ourselves
this you will discover is the truth

  after taking the directions of how to get to mono
city nally hailed a staunch-looking cab and was soon
speeding through the suburbs of seattle bound north

  some hours later the cab splattered with frozen mud
and water pulled into a small town made up com-
pletely of corrugated-iron shanties the driver slid to
a stop before a massive spidery-legged sheet-iron con-
struction that bore the name of mono city station
after paying the exorbitant but well-earned fare nally
hastened up the steps to the ticket office

  drawn by that singular fascination that overcomes
all travelers he walked to the edge of the platform and
gazed at the tracks which he noted instantly were
unlike anything he had ever seen before for instead of
the conventional two-rail roadway there was a single
rail well elevated above the ground on steel trestle work
to about five feet above the station floor it was a
mono-railroad

  a deep-toned bell clanged a guard walked the length
of the long platform warning the crowd to keep back
of the pipe railing which ran parallel to the edge of the
flooring but fifteen feet back

  from the distance echoed a long drawn-out whistle
and shortly there shot into view the train

  nally then saw why the
guard had warned them to
stay back projecting from
the sides of the stream-
lined cars whose general
outlines recalled to his mind
pictures of great passenger
planes were gondola-like
enclosures carrying electric
motors that drove the eight-
foot air-screws or propel-
lers the screws were back
thrusting and made a curi-
ous throbbing swish as they
spun each car carried four propellers so spaced on
each side that the distance from screw to screw through
the whole train was equal being driven by air pro-
pulsion only the wheels two to a truck were idlers
on these the emergency braking system operated

ten long cars made up this train only four being
passenger nally dubbed the first the engine as
it had larger forward windows and more powerful mo-
tors than the others

  as the propellers stopped dead the doors slid open

 t he chief attraction about the present story is that it
 contains  fact and not much fiction it might
 better be called a scientifact story than a scientifiction tale

   the monorail system is well known and has been in use
 for some years the author who is an engineer has im-
 proved the old system considerably and there is no reason
 at all why the machine as described by him coidd not be
 used tvhenever we are ready to do so

   indeed it is a constant source of wonderment to the
 editors why monorail transportation is not used more it is
 certainly most practical


a sharp curve was negotiated without slowing down or banking therefore nally decided the train must be kept upright by means
of gyroscopes  it seemed curious that the mere revolution o a weighted wheel should seemingly overcome the effects of gravity

                                                           and inertia 




amazing stories

and the crowd hastened into the cars nally settled
into a seat and looked over the furnishings which were
somewhat american in design but which still had a
curious trend toward the futuristic following the ex-
ample of the old-timers he stowed his baggage in a
locker under the seat

  a bell tinkled forward and slowly the train began to
move if the cars had been floating on water the mo-
tion could not have been smoother the trees and
shanties began to slip by with increasing speed still
there came no thud of wheels meeting track joints no
whining grind of gears just a low pleasant hum that
grew a little louder as the speed of the train crept up

  nallys eyes swept over the car and a smile flitted
over his face when he saw a burly lumberjack glance
nervously from his window to the forward end of the
car where a speedometer with figures large enough to
be seen from the rear showed the speed of the train
to be  miles an hour and while he studied it the rotor
turned up mile after mile

  the other rail twenty-five feet away was a metallic
glint trees raced by like patches of green blur while in
the distance the forests the streams and the snow-cov-
red landscape seemed to be revolving on a huge wheel
pressing his face against the glass nally was able to
see the transparent disc that denoted the propeller

  a sharp curve was negotiated without slowing down
 banking therefore nally decided the train
must be kept upright by means of gyroscopes he
mused on this thinking how curious it was that the
mere revolution of a weighted wheel should seemingly
overcome the effects of gravity and inertia how a
heavy wheel of no greater size than twenty-five feet
should conquer the wild roll of an ocean liner hundreds
of feet in length of its great value to the navies in the
fact that it controlled submarines through the depths
with uncanny accuracy made perfectly stable platforms
for the newer anti-aircraft guns and searchlights and
last but not least made the automatic stability control
of aircraft mechanically possible his reveries were
interrupted when the conductor came through the car
punching tickets

  say demanded nally searching for his ticket
which he had intentionally misplaced in order that he
could inveigle the conductor into conversation do these
trains ever jump the rail

  the conductor grinned no they dont jump off
they fly off when we hit a snowdrift seriously
this is about the safest form of high-speed transport
yet devised including the plane during the two years
we have been operating we have had but few accidents
-all caused by snow drifting across the rail find
your ticket

  yes here it is by the way what is the speed
limit he glanced at the meter which now quivered
at  miles

  sometimes the express trains three or four cars
rip over the rail at  coming down from the moun-
tains but the average doesnt go above  on the level
stretches

  nally was dazed to say the least one hundred and
fifty miles an hour a commerce carrier three times

as fast as the fastest crack trains and a monorail at
that how was it that the world did not know of it

  at six that evening the porter called dinner nally
happened to be one of those whose tickets had first
call he was seated by an attentive waiter

  he never forgot that dinner the luxuriously dec-
orated and panelled car might have been the private
salon of some hotel instead of the dining car of a mono-
rail train rushing at ninety miles an hour over the snow-
drifted valleys of british columbia

  as he left the diner nally came upon the conductor
and halted him with the question as to whether passen-
gers were allowed to inspect the engine receiving a
nod of affirmation nally hurried forward for he had
been waiting impatiently all afternoon to see the control
car of this wonder train

  stepping into the engine expecting to find it
crammed with all sorts of interweaving pipes and tubes
he experienced a tinge of disappointment two huge
mechanically neat softly drumming gasoline motors
were coupled to a large generator partly sunken into the
floor that reminded him of the gyroscopes nowhere
had he seen a trace of them those massive wheels
undoubtedly were set below the floors of the car and
hence were of immense weight as they were corre-
spondingly small in comparison with the cars perhaps
there were more than two to each car if that were
so the generator must produce an unusually heavy cur-
rent to take care of all the gyroscope motors and the
many driving motors an unusual amount

  instead of the messy levers and valves customarily
in use there was a slate switchboard illuminated by a
single shaded light in the dim radiance cast by this
nally made out the form of the motorman in a com-
fortable seat forward before the motorman was a
small board no larger than the average radio panel
set with numerous toggle switches the train was
operated by what is known as remote control no-
heavy sticking levers or handles to twist or turnrim-
ply a light finger touch would bring into action a com-
plicated system of timers and starting rheostats while
another touch would reverse the pitch of the screws
bringing the train to a quick cushioned stop

nally became conscious of a shrilling whistle that
seemed to come from outside the car and he was
unable to locate it until he suddenly recalled the high
speed at which the train was traveling he stepped
closer to the window glancing at the calm square-
jawed motorman whose eyes never strayed from the
glittering ribbon of steel that rolled in outlined in the
beams of the twin headlights the lights flashing over
the trestlework giving it an unearthly fragile appear-
ance and tinting the trees with a silver fringe that stood
out abrupt from the surrounding darkness seemed to
beckon the train to greater speeds yet almost two
miles of that ribbon were covered every minute

  he rested his elbows on the wide ledge watching the
black blurs that were distant trees flee backwards noted
the reflection of the wan moon on the frozen rivers and
streams and mused on the great change this road was
bound to make in the beautiful snow-bound countries
monorail



of the north a green light appeared in the distance
grew larger and was gone

  clear track

  another light a white one this time grew from a
pinpoint so rapidly that nally knew it to be a train com-
ing from the opposite direction

  here comes the meteor the fastest mail express on
the road announced the motorman shes hitting it
up pretty on the level ill bet there isnt a plane in
these parts that can show their tails to her when she
gets going

  a minute later a streak of whitened windows showed
for an instant on the opposite track a trailing blast
of an air whistle marked its passing

all the next day the monotrain hummed deeper into
 the snow-banked regions after a pause at daw-
son to exchange crews and refuel the train left at
seven-exactly fifteen hours after leaving mono city
with the city behind a raging snowstorm was encoun-
tered as the train began to climb the mountains here-
tofore the run had been on an almost level track wind-
ing in and out of the mountains detouring them but
now the contour was more rugged passes were infre-
quent so the track twisted and curled up the eleva-
tions and ran in an almost sheer drop down the oppo-
site sides at times the other rail would curve away
and would not reappear for fifteen or twenty miles

  after following the yukon river to circle the train
struck the divide between the yukon and the kuskok-
wim rivers almost an hour of steady climbing and
then the train hurtled over the summit

  the snow whirled and eddied about the cars as they
dipped down the shrill of the air grew intense the
speedometer crept up-  stood a bit at  and
reached its peak at  still not a trace of vibration
could be felt so well laid was that single rail soon
the speed decreased to normal for the divide was left
far behind

  as the hours flew by and the train dashed across the
wastes nally began to see the advantages of the mono-
rail system over all other means of transportation ele-
vated on a single thin ribbon of steel propelled by air-
screws which know no icy slippery track the mono
had every and all the advantages of the modern steam
or electric two-rail railroad plus the speed of the air-
plane although the blizzard howled and tore and
snow small stinging particles from the mountain tops
made sight of objects fifty feet away impossible the
mono shot over the rail at daring speed what mat-
tered a head wind when forty racing screws thundered
their defiance the motorman knew the section and
relied upon his safety devices and signal lights spaced
every eighth mile to warn him of danger

  nushagak was reached at seven in the evening and
the train with a new crew took up the last leg of the
 mile trip

  restless for the trip was becoming monotonous
nally wandered through the train glancing at the pas-
sengers the coaches were almost empty very few
except those on business made the trip to nome or be-
yond in mid-winter by far the greater number of

these were natives prospectors and traders here and
there was a man or woman whose dress and actions
made it evident that this was their first trip north in
the forward coach nally came upon a group of roughly
dressed men fur caps pulled down over their faces
hiding them presumably asleep one regarded nally
unfavorably through blinking eyes

  nally passed on through the narrow communicating
door to the engine and sought his former position at
the window

  the dazzling beams of the headlights apparently dis-
appeared at a point fifty feet from the car from that
point a glowing radiance swept back-a grayish radi-
ance cut and streaked by blinding white-hot meteors
that came shooting in from the regions beyond that
reached by the lights the interior of the engine
was dimly illuminated by the reflections below the
rail rolled in under the train-straight and true as a taut
wire the screws thundered and whined as the chang-
ing blasts of the blizzard tore and pulled at the cars
but they thanks to those spinning gyroscopes were as
rigid and unyielding as the mountains themselves

  turning to the motorman nally commented bad
night

  you bet nothing to worry about though well
roll into nome on time

  but what if something should happen

  what for instance queried the motorman

  well-broken rail hazarded nally knowing this
accident could cause a terrible wreck should the train
hit an open spot at the pace it was then going

  broken rail see that green colored plate on the
toggle board when a red light flashes in its place
a number of things may have happened a tree may
have fallen on the rail a bowlder may have demolished
a part of the trestle or the cold may have snapped or
sprung a switch if this train is on the section in which
the trouble lies an automatic trip-arrangement throws
off the power within the train immediately the emer-
gency brakes are applied and we come to a stop

  what i cant puzzle out continued nally after a
pause is how you could keep upright after the power
is off these cars look so top-heavy that it is a wonder
they dont fall over when we go round a curve

  if all the power was off the gyroscopes would keep
us upright for almost an hour in that time if we
could not get going again that is if we had motor-
generator trouble wed drop supporting bars to the
trestle transverse members and we would be held up-
right that way

  the conductor out of mono city mentioned run-
ning off the rail when hitting snow drifts is that
true

  in a way yes agreed the motorman the sur-
veyors when laying out the roadway took into account
those places where the snow drifted high and so made
the trestle-work higher to clear but you know man
cant guess all of natures tricks and so it happens
that once in a while we come upon a drift that is higher
than the rail and if we see it in time all is well if
not we just dig straight through tunneling into the
drift until the mono stops


amazing stories

nally listened to the shrilling wind and hoped no
drifts lay ahead that night at least not while
he was in the engine by the way he continued
how is it that this road hasnt been made known to the
world i never knew it existed until a day ago

  i couldnt say for sure from what ive heard this
is an experimental road built by a large american firm
if this system works out they expect to cover the entire
american continent with a vast monorail system i
guess its to cut down opposition and hard feelings that
news of it is kept quiet even so i guess a great many
people know that were doing a paying business up here
hauling a tremendous amount of freight that would
ordinarily go to the boats

  boy ejaculated nally that would be great
think of going from new york to chicago in nine
hours goodbye to the old forty-five mile an hour
chuggers 

  there was a movement to their rear and as nally
turned to see what caused it a new voice broke in
reach for the roof and be quick about it if you want
to live to see those monorail trains up

  the motorman glanced back and his face showed
surprise as he threw off the power

  four men in the rough garb of the northland stood
covering them with automatics nally recognized them
as the fellows he had noticed in the forward coach
evidently some sort of a train robbery was being
staged alaska was the last frontier and a few of
jesse james descendants roamed her mountain fast-
nesses and plains

  nally submitted to the rough handling of the bandits
who quickly had him bound and tied to a stanchion of
the large switchboard the motorman was tied about
six feet away from him meanwhile the fellow who
was apparently the leader studied the starting mechan-
ism and when the rope benders had completed their
job the four left the car

  what in the world do those fellows want de-
manded nally after making several fruitless attempts
to loosen his bonds

  nothing-why yes there is we have about
 in gold aboard that we picked up at dawson
these fellows must have gotten wind of the shipment
murmured the motorman im wondering what theyll
do after they find the gold

  after a few minutes the bandit chief returned he
grinned as he inspected nallys and the motormans
bonds then he busied himself about the switchboard
winding copper cable about the fuse blocks

  say what are you doing there demanded the mo-
torman realization of what was to follow dawning
upon him

  want to know he laughed throwing the coil of
cable to the floor yes with you two tied to the
floor the door locked and the safety fuses shunted
what is going to prevent this train from piling at
twenty mile hill what if the bridge were blown
out how does that hit you

  why you crazy loon dont you know what you
are about to do  cried nally seeing the man was seri-
ous

  this is my little joke laughed the bandit just
think of hitting that open bridge at  miles an hour
some mess when this car plunges on the rocks below
eh what

  who are you shouted the motorman beside him-
self with anger

  thats telling tales that will not concern you within
an hour retorted the robber turning on his heel at
the forward end of the car he took a ball of twine from
his pocket and tying one end on the starting toggle
switch he backed out of the car laying the cord care-
fully on the floor he ran the string under the door
closed and locked it

  well ill be a d- fool exploded the motorman
that rascal is the trickiest fellow ive ever seen he
can start the train from the ground-outside knowing
that the switch has to be pushed forward to bring the
train to a stop look the cord

  as he spoke the string grew taut the switch snapped
back and a series of clicks from the switchboard told
that the starting mechanism was at work the train
was in motion without a hand at the controls

  beside the trestle some ten men watched the slow
start of the monorail train with crazy grins contorting
their faces

  wait until they reach the bridge suggested the
leader theyll be sorry for having automatic control
a loud roar of amusement came from the men the
red and green tail-lights faded into the swirling snow

  the monorail train speeded up while the thud of
the motors and the whine of the generator grew louder

  how far is that bridge queried nally a curious
dry feeling settling in his mouth

  thirty miles or so all down grade mumbled the
motorman struggling to break loose

  the safety devices theyll stop us 

  not now that-the motormans double-edged
ozone-generating explosion forced a break-aid of the
devil fixed those up so they are useless

  nally turned and twisted trying to loosen the rope
a little just a little but they would not give he
did not hesitate but struggled on the sweat of despera-
tion rolling down his cheeks he had to get loose
every second brought that bridge that much closer
closer nearer faster

  his thoughts leaped ahead of the train he saw the
train rushing over the snow-drifted valley down which
the train was plunging with grinning death at the con-
trols the open bridge ahead the sickening lurch of the
cars as they fought to keep upright and then the rend-
ing crash of metal on unyielding rock he almost
leaped out of bounds for at that moment there came
a frenzied pounding at the door

  hey dickinson open the door

  cant were bound to the floor break it down
and for the love of life be quick about it the bridge
is out and we cant stop screamed the motorman

  the train lurched wildly around a curve its gyro-
scopic stability almost overcome by inertia straight-
ening out the mono streaked along at headlong speed
as it dropped down the long last grade

  nallys ropes slipped a trifle he was in agony the
monorail



mental strain and the pain from his torn wrists drew
muffled groans from his lips on him or the motorman
depended the lives of those in the other cars

 a crash 

the passengers and crew now alive to their dan-
ger were cutting through the thin metal door with
wreck axes

 the screech of the air about the cars was ear-rending

the axe head went on cutting long jagged streaks
in the door

nally and the motorman looked resignedly at each
other for their sharpened senses had felt the wheels
pound across the derail switch set a half mile from the

bridge at the present rate a few seconds away

  the door collapsed at the next stroke and the relief
motorman flew to the control board and threw the
screws into reverse the train slid onward emergency
brakes screaming screws churning up the air the car
became crowded with shouting milling men dicken-
son was released and he and nally stumbled forward

  they looked ahead then at each other amazed in
the glare of the headlights lay the long trestle bridge
unhurt and standing

  it wasnt blown up stuttered nally as the truth
dawned upon him it was the bandits little joke-
to draw our attention away from him

   continued from page 

  think of what it means to mankind observed
doctor monk maybe the secret of the earths shift-
ing of its poles can be learned

  doctor eddy picked up one of the plate-books how
much writing is on one plate he asked

  as much as is on about twenty-five pages of an
average book each of these squares is a page look
and see

  professor eddy gazed through his friends magnify-
ing glass wonderful he cried we are looking
at the first book doctor

  as it was now time to knock off work for the day
the professors and everybody else left the cavern and
returned to camp thinking nothing would be molested
as one would naturally think in the mountains where
even doors are left unlocked

  but they reckoned without taking into consideration
the stupidity of some corporations it is true the
power part of the tunnel was the primary concern of
those at the top but-they might have taken a bit
more interest in the excavation still going on if they
had done so such an irreparable loss would not have
taken place

  the night shift which had been at work when the
opening up of the secret chamber had been carried out
asked no questions as to whether explosions would in
any way affect the discoveries made instead when
parker-and i blame dan for this-came to leave the
hole he touched off the holes he had drilled

  -professor monk gave a gasp and nearly fainted
when he heard the shots

  whats wrong asked professor eddy

  nothing answered the other but they might have
told us

 who

  whoever set off those shots

  youre right exclaimed doctor eddy it might
have ruined those caskets they looked like glass
to me

iv

professor monk was so wrought up he
could not sleep that day you see he had been
on the night shift opening up that chamber of
mysteries sp he went and got professor eddy who
was also awake and the two went up to have a look

  now i wasnt along this time so ill have to give
hearsay and hearsay as anyone knows is unreliable

  when the two savants came to the room of their
wonderful discoveries they were aghast and well
they might be there was not a thing to be seen of
all that list of wonders professor monk tottered
you will not have to learn aramaic now professor
eddy he said brokenly

  why  asked eddy stunned and not knowing what
he said

  nothing to read

  where are the tablets

  doctor monk picked up a handful of sand at the
foot of the pedestal where the book sheets had reposed
this is all that remains of them he said they
were made of glass

but the caskets cried eddy where are they 

  monk picked up a handful of sand from a heap at
the foot of the carved mammoths this is part of
them he said

  but the bodies interposed eddy

  you dont grasp the nature of our discovery ex-
plained monk they were not bodies they were
glass replicas of the original they were wonderful
likenesses

  ill say they were said eddy and the maps
and histories

  glass all glass whispered monk hollowly

  no wonder nothing remains of that age remarked
the other nothing of the pre-glacial age it was
an age of glass

the fourth dimension

          he disappearance of professor jason t
          livermore the eminent scientist was one
          of those unaccountable mysteries that
          could not be explained there was noth-
          ing on which to base a theory no fact on
          which to begin an investigation he simply disap-
          peared that was all there was to it

  as his private secretary and pupil randolph s
forbes was subjected to endless questioning from the
professors many friends in the scientific and social
worlds it was all to no purpose he knew nothing
and could tell nothing

  on the night preceding livermores disappearance
forbes had accompanied him to a gathering at newton
hall where the scientist had made a brilliant speech
on the possibility of parallel lines meeting if sufficiently
prolonged afterwards they had driven directly to
the professors home and both had retired for the
night

  in the morning it was found that professor liver-
more had disappeared without leaving the slightest
trace his bed was unused and everything else was in
perfect order there was no word-nothing he
had vanished like an extinguished light

he never was seen again

the excitement caused by
the total disappearance of
so well known a man was
intense but time causes all
to be forgotten after a
while public interest was
transferred to an indian
prince who was reputed to
have five hundred wives

in reality the man belonged
to a cult which prohibited
marriage altogether

  forbes was retained by
professor livermores suc-
cessor and affairs settled
into their usual routine

yet he could not entirely
forget livermore had been a good employer and he
had had the personality of one in a thousand although
an excellent man and kindness itself the new incum-
bent was hopelessly academic he entirely lacked the
giant mentality and breadth of vision of his distin-
guished predecessor

late one stormy night many years after profes-
sor livermore had vanished forbes now a
man well along in middle age was sitting alone
in his chambers-thinking he had reached that medi-

tative mood on the borderland of sleep when he was
startled to hear the doorbell ring

  opening the door he saw a decent looking man of
about fifty who to judge from his general appearance
was some kind of high grade workman under his
left arm he held a small package which he was at some
pains to shield from the wind and rain

  i want to see mr forbes he stated mr ran-
dolph s forbes is the full name i believe he lives
here doesnt he

  i am randolph s forbes the secretary replied
at a loss to fathom his visitors business an idea of
some new hold-up technique flashed through his mind
to be dispelled by the self-evident solid middle-class
respectability of his visitor just then a particularly
vicious gust of wind almost blew the door from its
hinges dashing a cloud of rain into their faces the
requirements of ordinary courtesy asserted themselves

  you had better step inside forbes advised this
is a poor night for vestibule conversation

  it is rather moist to say the least the stranger
agreed with a pleasant smile that put at rest any
lingering doubts about burglars i wont keep you
long he added

  the man laid his precious package on the table and
unfastened the wrapping inside was an unusually
thick necked bottle made of some substance that looked

like opaque glass he con-
tinued 

  i am the foreman of the
gang which is working on
the new subway out in the
arlington district yester-
day we dug up this queer-
looking bottle it has your
name and address on it so
i told the super i would
stop around and give it to
you on my way home from
the union meeting tonight
is it yours

  forbes took the bottle and
examined it more closely
it was about the size and
shape of a common milk
bottle but where the cardboard cap should have been
was a lid that apparently was screwed on his own
name and address was written on this lid

  forbes was interested in the material of the bottle
which was unlike anything he had ever seen before it
seemed to be glass but was not brittle enough for it
bent slightly inwards under the pressure of his fingers
also it was far stronger than any glass in ordinary
use for according to the foreman the bottle had been
struck directly with a pick and had not broken as
could be seen

 j-j ere is a capital story that you cannot help but en-
      joy hugely

   what after all is evolution and ivhat surprising form is
 it not likely to take if you were ever at an aquarium and
 noticed some of the amazing and altogether inconceivable
 forms that marine life take on not even the most grotesque
 form imaginable can prove surprising to you thereafter fish
 that carry their own light supply in their eyes fish that carry
 their own saw fish that have their own vacuum suction
 arrangement and dozens of others equally astounding no
 longer phase us

   on the other hand did you ever see a man with a typical
 face that looked like a fox a man ivho looked like a pig
 and still another man who had a bird-like appearance
 biologists tell s that all of this is inherited from the lower
 animals

   the space bender makes this clear to the nth degree


to my consternation my guides i no longer regarded them as captors hesitated not a moment but proceeded to mount the giddy
way with the utmost unconcern i hung back they motioned for me to come on evidently entirely failing to understand the cause

of my reluctance




amazing stories

  by this time forbes was interested almost to the
point of excitement what could it be who had
addressed it to him and then buried it several feet
underground a thought struck him perhaps it was
a practical joke played by some of the college football
team with most of whom the agreeably mannered sec-
retary was on good terms

  if that were the game they should not have the
satisfaction of having their emissary witness the con-
summation of their pleasantry-not if he could help
it he gave the man some cock and bull story which
was accepted without comment thanked him for de-
livering the thing and slipping him something a little
more substantial than thanks got rid of him

  as soon as he had gone forbes tried to unscrew the
cap but could not budge it although he exerted all
his strength he was about to resort to a hammer and
chisel although what use a chisel would have been on
a substance like glass that was as tough as india rub-
ber is difficult to imagine when the happy expedient
of trying it left-handed occurred to him to his sur-
prise the cap came off without any trouble inside
was a quantity of closely written manuscript the idea
of a joke grew stronger

  ha ha he laughed jesting with himself the
manuscript found in a bottle eh by edgar allan
poe alias tom dick or harry of the football team
a clue to captain kidds treasure no doubt all
right boys if you can go to the trouble of writing all
that stuff and making a left-handed milk bottle out of
the lord knows what for the sake of a practical joke
on me im game enough to see it through so here
goes 

  he took out the manuscript half expecting to find
it a copy of caesars gallic war or something of the
sort glanced carelessly at it and dropped his pipe in
completely dumbfounded amazement

  here was no joke he knew that writing there
was no possibility of a mistake too often had he
copied pages of it correcting spelling and grammar
with which details the writer never bothered-that he
told his secretary was his job it was the writing of
the vanished scientist professor jason t livermore

  trembling with excitement forbes smoothed out the
pages with shaking fingers the writing was on some
land of white substance the nature of which he could
not determine it was like paper but thinner more
delicate the ink too was different from any ink
with which he was familiar it was a beautiful shade
of faint purple that seemed to glitter and gleam with
some interior luster for some unaccountable reason
forbes thought of his pet cat glancing down he
saw old archibald as he called the creature looking
at him with an intent stare

  paying no further attention to archibald who made
a couple of dignified noises and disappeared he rap-
idly skimmed through portions of the manuscript and
felt his eyeballs literally starting from their sockets
with stark unadulterated wonder sinking into the
most convenient chair he automatically lighted his pipe
and read and read and read

  never before since the world began had anyone come

across such a tale as lay before his wondering eyes

  what the world would say he knew not nor did
he care he at least believed professor jason t
livermore was the very type and soul of the cautious
scientist who meticulously verifies every conclusion by
the most detailed investigation and experiment it was
not in the man to perpetrate such an elaborate hoax
particularly a hoax without any conceivable motive

  no-let the crowd say what it would forbes be-
lieved of doubters he would ask two questions first
where was professor livermore second of what
substances were the bottle and manuscript composed
when these were answered perhaps he would be skep-
tical until then he would believe

  this is the story as recorded on the manuscript by
professor jason t livermore

 a s you know i have always been particularly
interested in the rather fantastical subject of
- the fourth dimension to my mind the pos-
sibility of a fourth dimension has opened a field for
scientific investigation where results might be obtained
beyond our wildest dreams

  the theory that time was the fourth dimension
however was something i could not accept this in-
volved the corollary that it was possible to travel in
time the same as in any other dimension i hold such
a feat to be impossible because time does not exist

  all arguments relative to time traveling seemed to
me to rest on a fallacy this is the belief that things
exist even for the fractional part of a second in a
state of rest they do not everything is in a state
of flux change is eternal it is just this change that
we call life

  time merely measures the duration of existence it
has no entity apart from the thing existing a child
is born when it has lived one year it has gone through
certain processes of growth which took place while
the earth completed its orbit around the sun while
the child undoubtedly did and does exist it is impos-
sible to point to any particular moment and say now
this is the time the child exists in the very act of
selecting the moment that moment has become the past
growth or change has proceeded and a child different
to the extent of such growth or change now exists

  time is simply a measure of the processes of life
the same as a foot is a measure of length who ever
heard of a foot long apart from something that is
a foot long we have marked on a rule a division
we call a foot when a piece of string is a foot long
we mean it has the same extension in length as the
division on the rule we call a foot and to which we
compare it

  in the same way when a child is a year old we
mean it has completed certain biological functions
while the earth was completing certain orbital move-
ments to which we compare it the term a year
long apart from the entity functioning during that
period has no more being than the term a foot long
has apart from the thing possessing that extension in
space

forbes paused for breath this was certainly pretty
the space bender



stiff reading rather dubiously he thought if the
rest of the manuscript continued in that vein he stood
an excellent chance of being in the lunatic asylum by
the time he got through he did have a hazy notion
of what livermore meant though although he was
not a famous scientist like his former chief forbes
was by no means a fool he possessed a very clear
and logical mind he summed it up walking about
the room and checking the points on his fingers

  time could not be a dimension one can move about
in a dimension to travel in time one must assume a
whole series of events past present and future all
going on at once

  a novel idea came into his mind it was so gro-
tesque it caused him to smile he could put all his
money out at interest travel a hundred years into the
future collect the fortune and return to the present a
rich man

  or he could go backwards into the past give him-
self good advice as to how he should avoid mistakes
he had made and so grow up to be a different man
but-then there would be two of him at present in-
stead of one no no-the thing was too absurd
livermore was right time was not the fourth
dimension

   he relighted his faithful pipe assisted archibald
who had reappeared to a strategic position on his knee
and went on with his reading

  from the above the manuscript continued it is
easy to see that abstract terms of all kinds are really
meaningless concrete things exist and have being
possessing the special qualities proper to their particu-
lar form of existence but the qualities in themselves
do not and cannot exist apart from the object of which
they are attributes it went on

 t eaving out of consideration the ether with
which our present argument is not concerned

   j space is nothing it is the absence of some-
thing hence paradoxical as it may seem space does
exist as a mental concept simply by being nothing

   to make my meaning clear try to think of the color
red without thinking of some object that is red you
cant do it but you can easily think of space without
anything in that space in fact so soon as you put
something in space that particular part of space
ceases to be space just because there is something there

  therefore it is possible to travel to move about
freely in space we know of three basic ways in which
we can move each of them at right angles to another

  a forwards and backwards or length b side-
ways or breadth and c up and down or depth
in other words space as we know it permits objects
to move in three dimensions or combinations of the
same there is no reason to suppose however that
other beings differently constituted may not know a
space allowing other dimensions-four by way of ex-
ample it is not a question of the attributes of space
space has no attributes being the absence of attributes
it is a question of the faculties for perception of the
beings inhabiting space

  assume a two dimensional world a universe in

which people have a knowledge of length and breadth
but no knowledge of the third dimension depth such
a world would be the surface of a map the inhabi-
tants of our hypothetical mapworld would move about
on the surface of the map much as a block of wood
floating just awash in a tub of water would move about

  they would live in or on the surface of the map
which would be their space their range of vision
would be forwards backwards and sideways but never
up or down they would have no knowledge of up or
down which requires a third dimension to them
the third dimension would not exist any more than the
fourth dimension exists for us however it would be
there just the same exactly as the fourth dimension
may exist in spite of the fact that we know nothing
about it

  suppose the map were produced upon the surface
of a globe it would then be in a three dimensional
world but the inhabitants of mapworld looking along
rather than out of their two dimensional space would
never know it their space would still appear to be
flat to have only two dimensions

  it would be an axiom of the geometry of the map-
world that parallel lines could not meet yet if two
mapworld professors should travel sufficiently far
along two of their supposed parallel lines known as
meridians of longitude they would find they did meet
at the poles if they were not blockheads this fact
would prove the existence of a third dimension

  certain experiments disclosed that some of our
apparently parallel lines if sufficiently prolonged in our
three dimensional space showed a tendency to come
together this indicated the existence of a fourth
dimension

  i set myself to work to prove it by a series of
experiments dealing with the speed of light and a num-
ber of other things i reached a point where i was
obliged to accept the existence of another dimension at
right angles to the ordinary three dimensions this
was the much talked of fourth dimension

  all that was required was the ability to see it to
experience it and-to get into it yes to get into it
for i made up my mind to devote my life if necessary
to perfecting a machine of which i already had the
rough idea that would project me out of our universe
into the fourth dimension

  you must not think that this idea is as fantastic
as it seems i had no intention of trying to remain
in a universe of four dimensions for any length of
time i knew well enough such an attempt would
mean my death

  if you will stop to consider for a moment you will
see this inevitably would be the case let us return to
our analogy of mapworld to one of these people
a square for instance would not look like what we
call a square looking straight ahead or to either
side all they could see would be two of the boundaries
of the square or two lines vanishing into the distance
at an angle

  to us however a square is an entirely different
thing looking dozvn upon it we see an area of sur-
face inclosed by four straight lines we see the inside


amazing stories

of it a square viewed in a three dimensional world
is so utterly different from a square viewed in a two
dimensional world that it is not the same thing at all
from the mapworlders view it is not a square at all

  in the same way if i succeeded in transporting
myself into the fourth dimension a cube would be as
different from what we call a cube as a square viewed
from three dimensions would be different from what
our two dimensional friends would call a square it
wouldnt be a cube it would be something else

  so with everything a four-dimensional world
would be so far removed from anything which the five
senses of humanity are capable of appreciating that
the functions of the human body-made for use in a
world of three dimensions-would cease and death
would result

  it was my purpose to enter the fourth dimension
but to return to the normal world of three dimensions
before the merest fraction of time had elapsed in
this way i hoped to be able to survive just as it is
possible to step quickly through a room full of poison
gas without being killed also i should take the extra
precaution of drugging myself into a state of insensi-
bility to avoid the terrific sensations attendant upon
entry into a world not made for men

  no doubt you will wonder what use the experi-
ment would be if it were to last only a second espe-
cially since i should be unable to see anything even for
that second  so far as the fourth dimension was con-
cerned it would be no use at all the fourth dimen-
sion was not what i intended to investigate it ad-
mitted of no investigation by humanity my plan
was to make use of the fourth dimension to travel
distances in the third dimension which were otherwise
impossible to man in short i had made up my mind
to go to the planet venus

tmiere were several reasons why i selected
venus as the object of my stupendous journey
the conditions likely to be found on that planet
closely resembled those on this earth the size of
venus its diameter is about  miles is very nearly
that of the earth while its mass and density bear the
respective relations of  and  to those of the earth
these facts were of great importance

  if i went to a heavenly body much less than the
earth in size mass and density my weight would be
so much reduced that walking about would consist of
a series of gigantic leaps and bounds which it is
doubtful if an organism constituted as yours and mine
are could survive even allowing that the shock of
alighting would be correspondingly lessened

  on the other hand to visit a planet possessing the
opposite characteristics might increase my weight so
that i could scarcely move at all under these condi-
tions my bony framework would probably be unable
to support my flesh and i should fall apart

  furthermore it was reasonably certain that venus
possessed an atmosphere which would support life
which was a necessary requirement there were two
things however that gave rise to serious doubts
venus at its mean distance from the sun is 

miles nearer that luminary than is the earth so that a
temperature considerably hotter than any to which i
was accustomed might be encountered

  on the other hand some astronomers held that
the inclination of the axis of venus would produce
a winter correspondingly dangerous at the other ex-
treme

  the highest temperature ever recorded on earth
was  degrees fahrenheit at death valley u s a
while the lowest temperature on record was  de-
grees below zero fahrenheit in siberia

  human life is a very delicate organization adapted
to this earth i did not expect to live in a temperature
much outside of these limits i dismally reflected the
question was-should i be roasted or frozen to death
well-i must take the chance just as other pioneers
had done before me

  the distance of the planet from the earth made no
difference by the method i proposed to employ all
distances were alike this was literally to bend our
three dimensional space during the second i should be
in the fourth dimension so that the planet venus and
the earth would touch not touch in three dimensional
space you understand but touch in four dimensional
space then while the planets were in juxtaposition
my fourth dimensional machine would roll me totally
unconscious from the earth to venus

  most likely you will consider this to be the ravings
of a madman i assure you however i was far from
insane theoretically the thing was quite possible and
i was willing to stake my life which of course i
was doing that it was also possible practically

  again consider mapworld-a map of the united
states for instance on such a map new york and
san francisco are represented as approximately three
thousand miles apart any creature traveling along
the surface of the map must travel the entire distance
to get from one city to the other this in two dimen-
sions the only dimensions of which our mapworld
folks have any knowledge nevertheless you and i
being in the third dimension could readily grasp either
end of the map and bend it into a position roughly
approximating a half cylinder so that the two cities
touch

  furthermore the inhabitants of the map to which
they would be bound by the laws conditioning their
two dimensional being would not know the map had
been bent as explained before the map would still
appear flat and they would crawl about in their two
dimensional world entirely unaware that their space-
the map-had been moved through the third dimension
they might be rather amazed to find themselves trans-
ported from new york to san francisco in an instant
but they could have no understanding of how they got
there

  my machine which i actually perfected after
months of experiment sleepless nights of unremitting
toil when failure seemed all that i could expect would
i believed when set in motion project itself into the
fourth dimension take hold of our three dimensional
space and bend it until this earth and the planet
venus met
the space bender



  i cannot give you an accurate and detailed exposi-
tion of the machine which i named the space bender
because frankly my dear fellow you would not under-
stand me if i did besides the discovery is mine i
alone conceived it thought it out planned it made it
i do not intend to share the secret with anyone not
even you old chap until i feel so disposed

  the physical appearance of the space bender was
unique and interesting it was made of a new metal
i invented resembling copper but much harder and
having a gloss and smoothness greater than copper
i obtained it by subjecting-but there i said i would
not reveal the secret and i wont

  in general it looked like a large ill-shaped pair of
tongs having two sets of grasping implements one on
each end with the handle in the middle there were
certain dials like the dials on an ordinary radio receiv-
ing set which enabled me to measure the exact degree
of bend i desired these were what i may term my
range finders by their control it was possible to
make the proper angle of bend to touch venus instead
of some other stellar body it was furnished with a
little lever by which the apparatus could be set in
motion one set of tongs would bend three dimen-
sional space the other set would be fastened around
my body to push me through the fourth dimension
from the earth to venus

  so much for the machine everything was ready
by the night of the meeting at newton hall my plans
had been perfected my arrangements made i awaited
the adventure so soon as i left you i went from my
room to the laboratory packed a small gripsack with a
number of useful articles including a good automatic
throwing an explosive bullet this was certainly advis-
able who could tell what fearful creatures i might
encounter before i got back to earth again

  i fastened the machine around my body set the
dials at the proper positions took a large dose of mor-
phine and with my hand on the switch waited for
the drug to take effect

  i knew that i faced death it was quite possible
that i would never reach venus that i would be in-
stantly killed when i set the machine in operation
even if i did reach my goal and actually did arrive on
the planet venus would i be any better off what
monsters might i not find there what terrors what
horrors undreamed of by terrestrial man how did
i know what was there perhaps there would be
beasts to whom my explosive bullets would merely be
irritating flea bites

  in spite of all this i was calm and collected i had
taken no one into my confidence i wished to avoid
becoming the butt of ridicule if i failed i knew
what i was doing and was prepared to go through with
it i was sustained by the support that has upheld
countless martyrs through untold tortures throughout
the ages-the desire for knowledge the thirst for truth

  ha i nearly fell asleep then the morphine was
working i must throw the switch no-whats the
use its too much work ill just drift off to sleep
-to sleep-to   

  this would never do with a tremendous effort

i roused myself reached out thousands of miles and
turned the switch

  a blinding flash of rose-colored light overwhelmed
me i felt light as air my soul soared out up on-
wards    my whole being seemed to be aflame burn-
ing a terrible sickness seized me my very bones
were racked and tormented it did not seem that i
could bear the frightful anguish with a last ex-
cruciating hell of agony the rose-colored flame burst
into a million bubbles of living pulsing fire-and van-
ished  utter complete blackness came upon me i
ceased to feel to think to be it was the end

part ii

venus

t was awakened by a warm gentle rain falling
on my face for a time i made no effort to

  a collect my senses but lay with eyes closed
pleasantly inert enjoying to the full a delicious sense
of contentment and languor

  gradually it dawned upon me there was something
i ought to do or remember it tormented me persist-
ing in spite of all efforts to drive it from my thoughts
i was extremely hot the atmosphere was like that
in a greenhouse humid sickening overpowering i
did not open my eyes but continued to lie in a kind of
stupor the perspiration running from every pore

  as fast as i would drowse off the idea of some-
thing neglected would prod me into consciousness
curse it couldnt a man even take a nap without
being annoyed in this way what could it be that i
ought to do something there was-something im-
portant but try as i would in my half-somnolent
condition i was unable to recall the circumstance

  the rain which continued to fall with a mild in-
sistence made me think of water-rivers-boats-
gondolas-italians-venice-ye gods it dawned
upon me the thing i was trying to remember was
that at this very minute if my foolhardy experiment
had succeeded i was no longer on good old mother
earth i was on the planet venus millions yes millions
of miles away from home friends and all that i held
dear

  of course with the space bender in my posses-
sion it would be just as easy to return to the earth
from venus as to go to venus from the earth but-
all this would take time i should have to go care-
fully over the apparatus to see that it was in perfect
working condition before again venturing on a journey
through the fourth dimension so for the time being
i was isolated on the planet venus without hope of aid
or protection from whatever dangers might surround
me other than that afforded by my own efforts

  bosh i thought the planet venus indeed what
nonsense probably the wonderful experiment in-
stead of opening a new world to mankind had been
an absurd failure no doubt at present i was lying
on the laboratory floor with a broken water pipe squirt-
ing in my face by this time i was fully awake i
opened my eyes and looked about

something had happened at any rate wherever


amazing stories

i was i was no longer in the laboratory i was lying
in a little glade near a rather swiftly flowing river of
muddy looking water tall grass grew all about me
but not thickly enough to obstruct the vision entirely
at once i noticed a most unusual peculiarity about this
grass it was yellow not the seared dead yellow of
autumn but a bright fresh yellow denoting the
strength and vigor of growing youth nearby were
some large bright blue blossoms that made me think
of peonies although i had never before seen blue ones
they had a strange odor which i was unable to place
at first but which i later associated with catnip

  i realized that my amazing adventure really had
succeeded and that actually i was on the planet venus
while terribly excited as you may imagine i was not
inclined to any grandiloquent theatricals about the
first man and all that goes with that sort of thing
no my situation was entirely too uncertain and acute
to permit of any posing to myself or to anyone else-
if there were anyone else it behooved me to go
slowly and keep a wary eye

  feeling unusually thirsty most likely the after ef-
fects of the drug i got out my collapsible drinking
cup and dipped a generous portion from the nearby
stream it was disagreeably warm in fact it was
almost steaming but it answered the purpose it was
water

  it had stopped raining glancing up i saw a
sodden sky through which the sun was trying to peep
in front of me was a field of yellow grass in which
some rather large animals were quietly feeding on
enormous white mushrooms i hid behind a con-
venient hillock and as you may well believe gave the
creatures a pretty close scrutiny i had never seen
anything like them they were about the size of sheep
but there the resemblance ended for these beasts what-
ever they were looked exactly like gigantic mice they
did not appear to be savage and to judge from the fact
that they were browsing off some kind of vegetable
growth they were not carnivorous either it would
not do to be too sure however

  the sun came out brightly dissipating the remain-
ing vestiges of storm suddenly without any warn-
ing sound whatever a man-at least he appeared to be
human-stepped directly in front of me from a neigh-
boring thicket and stood regarding me intently with an
emotionless stare i did not understand how he could
have moved so silently through the long grass but he
gave me little time for speculation

  with a spring of lightning-like quickness he leaped
upon me bore me to the ground with an ease denoting
tremendous strength and swiftly bound me so that i
was unable to move hand or foot he then stood
quietly contemplating me for a short while during
which time you may well believe that i observed him
apparently having satisfied his curiosity he turned and
walked rapidly away without so much as a backward
glance

  despite my terrible fear as to what fate was in
store for me i could not but be interested in my cap-
tors personal appearance in general outline he was
the same as i myself in other words this inhabi-

tant of another planet was human of that there was
no doubt his figure however was more sinuous
more lithesome than any physique possessed by earthly
man there was a certain innate grace and dignity in
his carriage which contrasted detrimentally to our
jerky spasmodic walking

  his features were most peculiar his forehead
while fully broad enough to vouch for an excellent
mentality nevertheless was flatter and more receding
than ours his ears were slightly triangular and most
remarkable of all they were pitched or slanted for-
ward the nose was short straight as an arrow
and the nostrils were expanded and open

  i did not like the fellows eyes they were a
beautiful yellow tinted with green but were close
together and had a lurking glitter that gave an uncom-
fortable impression of merciless cruelty to sum up
while the man was undeniably handsome his good looks
were of that sinister beauty one associates with-cats
that was it he made me think of a cat

y interesting but certainly fearful reflections
were interrupted by the mans return this
time he was accompanied by several other
similar individuals under the direction of an elderly
person dressed in a gorgeous yellow and black striped
cloak who seemed to be in command i was partially
unbound and pushed forward in a manner that clearly
indicated i was to accompany my captors

  i was perforce obliged to obey indeed i wished to
go with them i had come these millions of miles to
see what was to be seen they permitted me to retain
the space bender why should i hesitate

  we entered a closed car like our sedans although
the coloring would have excited lively interest on
broadway it was black and white in irregular daubs
or splotches the same as some black and white cats
are marked in place of the little image usually found
on our radiator caps was a representation of an out-
spread claw the talons were about five inches long
curved and sharply pointed of course the thing was
only a metal decoration but the workmanship was
amazingly clever and produced an extremely realistic
impression in conjunction with my position as the
lone representative of another world and the cat-like
appearance of these people the claw gave me a devil-
ishly uncomfortable feeling

  they started the car in much the same way we
start an auto by shifting a number of levers or gears
it was very noticeable that the horrible racket some-
times incident to our starting a car was entirely lack-
ing i may mention here that this people hated and
detested all noise their earnest efforts had been de-
voted to the elimination of all sound instead of horns
bells whistles and the like-contrivances intended to
produce sound of one kind or another-they had ma-
chines cunningly devised to prevent all vibrations that
might affect the hearing i found this out later of
course at the time though i was merely struck by
the silent smoothness with which the car started and
ran

  we proceeded at a moderate pace along an excel-
the space bender



lent road toward what i took to be a distant city as
we rode along my guards conversed in low beauti-
fully modulated contralto voices utterly unlike the
raucous grunts and shrieks of human speech the
language was wondrously melodious it seemed to be
all vowels with the addition of some extra ones un-
known on earth heard by anyone who does not
understand it our language would no doubt sound
like the chatter of apes to me the language of this
people closely approximated the purring of well-bred
refined cats

  i began to be less afraid clearly i was in the
hands of rational beings human beings just as much
as you or i they had no reason to harm me i had
injured them in no way and i could not see why they
should wish to do me ill furthermore they ap-
peared extremely interested in me evidently regarding
me as a subject for scientific investigation and study

  their deportment to me was most kind and con-
siderate their manners to one another were excel-
lent each occupant of the sedan i call it that for
want of a better name sat in his own place attending
to his own business except when taking part in the
conversation no one interrupted or broke in on the
speech of another as a result there was an entire
absence of the confusion and tumult that would have
characterized a similar scene on earth my scientific
training began to dominate my alarm i really began
to enjoy myself

  we entered the city the streets were broad spa-
cious and well paved the material was a kind of
cement that had been treated in a way to deaden all
sound we rolled sedately on between large com-
modious houses surrounded by well-kept gardens of
the prevailing yellow hue which by this time i had
learned to accept as common to the vegetable life of
venus it hurt my eyes one of the men noticing
that i blinked gave me a pair of glasses which dead-
ened the glare without destroying the ability to see
colors i wore these for the rest of my sojourn among
this race

  a very striking peculiarity of the architecture was
that the window panes were all of opaque glass which
entirely precluded any prying into private affairs either
from without or from within evidently this folk had
the excellent habit of attending to their own affairs

  i was greatly impressed by the cleanliness displayed
on every hand they carried this to the pitch of an
obsession in one of the most beautiful gardens to
my unutterable astonishment i saw a person whom i
judged to be a domestic servant actually dusting each
separate blade of grass with a little brush apparently
designed for the purpose i could not help smiling at
the thought of what would happen to a careless smoker
who scattered ashes on a floor guarded and cleaned
by one of these housewives

  we turned into a broad curving driveway which
stretched in a graceful sweep between triple rows of
bright orange-colored palms to a two-storied building
of robins egg blue marble the effect of the orange-
hued foliage and the brilliant blue stone may be im-
agined

  the first story of this edifice evidently a public
building of some kind had no entrance there was
an opening on the second floor but i saw no way of
getting to it save by a double balustrade which swept
in easy curves one from the right and one from the
left from the ground to the floor as the pathway
along the top of these balustrades was only about three
inches wide i did not see how anyone short of a circus
performer could manage the ascent

  to my consternation my guides i no longer re-
garded them as captors hesitated not a moment but
proceeded to mount the giddy way with the utmost
unconcern i hung back they motioned for me to
come on evidently entirely failing to understand the
cause of my reluctance

  i was at a loss to make plain my difficulty as these
chaps apparently were as sure-footed as cats and had
no conception of the sensation of dizziness finally
i hit upon a way of presenting my case i walked a
foot or so up the incline and then deliberately stum-
bled and fell off they consulted together for a while
after which it was apparent they had grasped my
meaning although sorely puzzled to assign a reason
for so strange an aberration

  the leader ordered two of the party to take hold of
me to steady my steps by this means i got up safely
and entered the building the inside was a vast hall
containing a large assortment of luxurious couches and
divans arranged in a circle about a slightly higher dais
on which reclined a venerable personage whom i made
out to be the king or other ruler

  this man possessed the most enormous moustaches
it has ever been my lot to see they stuck straight
out on either side of him to adistance of at least
eight inches giving a most ferocious appearance to an
otherwise entirely benign and indolent looking counte-
nance his peculiarity directed my attention to the
fact-hitherto recognized only by my subconscious
mind-that these people were equipped with inordi-
nately large moustaches greatly resembling the whis-
kers of a cat

  hanging in silver cages at every available point
about the room were beautiful yellow birds exactly
like canaries but of the size of ravens these delight-
ful creatures continually sang in voices of exquisite
richness their music was unlike any singing of birds
i had ever heard they produced connected definite
melodies in four full parts imagine it forbes my
boy if you can choral selections in intricate struc-
ture of rhythm and counterpoint the equal of any of
our most famous compositions rendered by the fresh
unaffected voices of natures children of the forest and
meadow-birds it was a musical glory to stifle the
senses with rapture it was easy to see this people
had not eliminated all sound merely such sounds as
they did not wish to hear-such as those produced by
the incompetent performer real artists were highly
esteemed

  the king raised his hand in an instant the singing
ceased after a short consultation with my conduc-
tors he looked directly at me he then pointed to a
small person nearby who carried what i took to be a

couple of large books and slowly pronounced the word
tomasso after this he rapidly opened and shut his
mouth several times without making a sound as the
lone representative of my world i did not like to
appear dense but i must confess that for a moment
i failed to comprehend his meaning then it dawned
upon me the little fellow was named tomasso and
would teach me their language

  i smiled in a manner i intended to denote intelli-
gence-perhaps i only looked foolish-and nodded my
head to show i understood the king whose name
i later ascertained to be tabi was satisfied i was
led away to a room comfortable in every detail this
became my home for several weeks while i was learn-
ing to speak their tongue i will not bore you with
the manner in which this was accomplished the
theme has been gone over in every tale and romance
of adventurers thrown among alien races it will suf-
fice to state that at last i did become fairly proficient
in speaking their soft and melodious language

 tt then i had become sufficiently adept to con-

   verse intelligently i was accorded many in-
  terviews with king tabi here i met many
of his attendants and counselors all deeply interested in
what i had to tell them of my world

  in turn they imparted their history and manner of
life to me it is needless to state it enthralled me my
daily existence was now a quiet enjoyment of scien-
tific intercourse with refined and cultured beings yet
in spite of all this ever and anon a wave of horrible
loneliness overpowered me because of my complete
separation from my kind

  for despite their cultural advancement and their
kindness they were different completely fundamen-
tally different it was not the divergence to be found
in a person of another country or another race who
for all of his strange ways was fundamentally the
same human being the world over

  it was a chasm impossible to bridge a gap across
which there was no passage they were a different
genus at this point i may as well tell you what i had
already dimly suspected and what you may have
guessed for yourself they were evolved from cats
just as we are descended from apes

  but do not misunderstand me my dear forbes
they were not cats they were human beings just
as much as you and i they were no more cats than
we are monkeys

  although venus is a younger planet than the earth
the more rapid breeding propensities of the feline had
compensated for this adverse time-factor with the re-
sult that their evolution had been fully accomplished
generation upon generation of adjustment to environ-
ment-the survival of the fittest and all it implies-
had brought about modifications in the cat to produce
the cat-man analogous to those impressed upon the ape
to produce the ape-man

  evolution produces but modifications differentia-
tions the fundamental germplasm is always present
breeding true to type throughout the centuries and
ignore it as we will yet it forms the dominant theme of

the song of life nevertheless it must be so

  it is a long way from a meeting at newton hall
of scientists arrayed in starched shirt fronts and im-
maculate white ties to the primeval chaos of the tree-
top and it was a long way from the sedate dignified
handsomely attired men and women attending a func-
tion at king tabis court to the blood and reek of the
jungle but the ape forms the basis of the one and the
cat lurked beneath the surface of the other

  to make clear my meaning consider the ape-like
characteristics of humanity most people accept evo-
lution as a theory that we have been descended from
monkeys and-there conveniently stop pushed to its
logical conclusion however to be descended from a
common ancestor with the ape means to possess the
same mental make-up as the ape a million times re-
moved in degree if you will but identical in kind
from this conclusion there is no escape

  the insatiable curiosity of the monkey has become
in man the scientific zeal that probes the stars and
fathoms the secrets of the invisible atom in minds
of lesser caliber however it has become a miserable
prying into other peoples business the chatter and
mouthings of the ape have developed into the grandest
oratory the most noble drama-and also into the
senseless clap-trap of ordinary conversation of the
street the inconsequential lack of purpose displayed
by monkeys has brought forth mankinds delight in
wholesome play games and the like but it has likewise
wasted the greater part of his efforts in the pursuit of
useless baubles the acquisitiveness of the ape the
desire to get hold of things has given us our property-
sense from which come the benefits of business and
commerce but it also has produced the loathsome miser
in his lonely garret

  so with all else our civilization is simian in ori-
gin our virtues are simian virtues our vices are simian
vices our thoughts our very selves are simian and
simian they will remain

  in the same way in this people the characteristics
of the cat under the spur of evolution had grown
into a mentality which while removed to the nth de-
gree from the limits of the cat nevertheless at heart
was the mentality of the cat to be explained only by
cat psychology

  their civilization equally as intricate and highly
developed as ours was a feline civilization based on
feline hopes and desires and suited only to feline in-
habitants its good points were the virtues of cats
its faults were the imperfections of cats in which no
other animals save cats would have gone astray in
them as in us the life force had bred true no mat-
ter how cultured no matter what intellectual heights
they might scale cats they were and cats they would
remain until their act was played out and their curtain
rung down

   our government said king tabi leaning back
on his cushion on which was beautifully depicted in
gold embroidery a mythological legend representing
a dog presenting a gift of a mouse to some cat-god
compared to yours is a strange mixture of freedom
and despotism
the space bender



  he thoughtfully blew a couple of fragrant whiffs
from his catnip perfecto and knocked off the ash into
a little blue china tray on which was painted a pretty
love scene where several gay gallants serenaded a
famous belle of a bygone day he told me this was
a scene from their age of romanticism corresponding
to our days of chivalry

   from what i have been told your government is
quite unlike ours i replied accepting a helping of
roast canary but tactfully declining a rat sirloin that
is to be expected however naturally the feline tem-
perament would produce a different ideal from the
simian

   yes quite different his majesty replied our
earnestness of purpose a cat never fools it always
means business you know holds that absolute author-
ity is the most efficient way of getting things done
hence in public matters i exercise a power beyond
any power known to your kind

   our generals in war time have full power i ven-
tured

   true but according to you even they are limited
by custom and public opinion i am limited by noth-
ing a citizen who questions one of my royal decisions
would not be held at fault he would be considered
insane and placed in a mad house

   on the other hand he went on our love of per-
sonal freedom prevents any attempt to regulate the
lives of the people in private matters if i tried to
interfere in morals education religion and what-not in
the way you tell me your governments do my reign
and my life by a simultaneous end would pay forfeit
to my temerity

  he delicately sipped a valerian sherbert but
pshaw why should i wish to he smiled and set
down the empty glass which was instantly removed by
a small fellow dressed in gray livery what do i care
what they do so long as they keep the law and pay
their taxes

  here was food for thought for the life of me i
could not decide whether our system or theirs was bet-
ter the callous selfishness of king tabi in regard
to the welfare of his people was truly appalling but
as he himself pithily remarked is our paternalism
entirely altruistic or does it largely gratify a simian
desire to poke our noses into some other fellows
business

  then there was the despotism why life would be
unbearable if one were at the unqualified mercy of a
monarch like king tabi yet when all was said and
done was the entire system of government more des-
potic than those on earth which is more irksome-
implicit blind obedience in a few things with entire
liberty in all else or a modified partial obedience in
almost every act of ones life from the cradle to the
grave  we gave it up i could not decide and neither
could the king we agreed that our way was no doubt
best for us and their way was best for them

t held many interesting conversations with a
professor leo meow who was head of

  jl the educational system if their method could be

called system to me it seemed chaos the absence of
all system and yet it worked it produced results its
basis again was the love of personal freedom inherent
in every member of the cat tribe

   we compel no one asserted professor leo what
is the use if they dont want an education one cant
put brains into their empty heads by forcing them to
go through a routine curriculum they neither appreci-
ate nor understand	
but professor i objected somewhat shocked at
his open brutality dont you think even a little educa-i
tion is better than none such total ignorance-

  leo was a rather crusty old codger whom one had
to handle with care i had offended he rose from
his divan and took a position directly in front of me
delivering the following ukase in his best lecture-room
manner his green eyes snapped and his whiskers
stood out horizontally with outraged dignity at the
barest intimation of contradiction he must have been
a fine old customer for anyone to study under i
wish he had some of our freshmen hed make them
sit up and take notice but i digress

   education is open to all he said rich and poor
alike there is no distinction all must pay the same
price not in money as you do but in personal service
a student binds himself to his college as a servant in
his particular line for a term of years proportional
to the particular branch he selects the dull and in-
dolent are ruled out of this sort of thing by their own
natural lack of ambition only those possessed of
minds really worth-while enter the colleges at all the
result is all college graduates make good in their par-
ticular fields

  he glared at me for a minute seemingly searching
for a word finally he found it it was one of our
words their vocabularly had no equivalent which i
had taught him and which momentarily had escaped
his mind

   we have no flunks he snapped and walked out
his statement was true they had none by allow-
ing nine-tenths of the population to eliminate them-
selves they avoided any failures among those who
elected to study the results of their system were
unique a simply overwhelming majority was steeped
in an ignorance darker than blackest night at the
top of their society was a ruling class of actual gen-
iuses who reached their high position not by political
pull or the might of wealth but by sheer downright
brain power for every one of our people who can-
not read or write they had a thousand but for one
columbus shakespeare verdi or edison they had ten
or twenty which was better their way or ours
but i am recording a visit to a strange land not writ-
ing a philosophical treatise

heir science of medicine was far below ours
indeed it was scarcely to be mentioned in the
same breath the egoistic self-centered nature of the
cat had prevented any real progress in a sphere which
of all fields most requires sympathy and human under-
standing

  such hospitals as they had were torture chambers


amazing stories

shambles anaesthetics were unknown the well-
known fortitude of the cat under the severest pain had
rendered them unnecessary their doctors butchers
would be more appropriate performed major opera-
tions on unlucky devils in full possession of their
senses vivisection  they had it-and then some

  imagine it you earth men who find it necessary to
apply soothing talcum powder to take away the sting
of a shave legs sawed off stomachs gashed open
brains sliced and pared-god knows what atrocities
perpetrated with a cynical indifference that would have
made nero blush for shame

  my suggestion to give them the benefit of my
greater knowledge the fact was not questioned was
met with a surprising lack of interest naturally one
would think the subject of health would be absorbing
to any race whether descended from cats or what-not
not a bit of it

   whats the use friend lieveemour remarked the
lady to whom i was expounding my plan this lady
by the way had just buried a relative whom i easily
could have saved if a thing is out of order one
throws it away doesnt one she paused to gently
fan herself with a gorgeous fan made entirely of canary
feathers well she languidly continued if a human
being is broken or worn out    she smiled a be-
witching smile and went on fanning herself

  her unfinished sentence was more eloquent than a
lecture could have been it brought home to me the
tremendous gap between their civilization and ours
the difference between the cat and the ape i thanked
god that with all its faults i traced my descent from
the ape however as king tabi would put it belong-
ing to the latter naturally i would look at it that way
he didnt it was all in the point of view

  mechanically they were centuries ages ahead of
us mechanical contrivances the nice adjustment of
cogs wheels bolts and the like is the science of pa-
tience par excellence exact balance perfection of
workmanship is essential and what creature is more
patient than a cat compare the untiring persistence
with which puss watches a mouse hole with the rest-
less nervous leaping about of jocko from perch to
pole and a slight idea of the superiority of the cats
descendants in a calling needing patience can be im-
agined

  their chief engineer told me the main drive wheel
at their water works was set and reset three hundred
and fifty-two times before it was finally passed the
result is it has never needed any attention although it
has run continuously for over forty years so with
all their work they do it right in the first place no
matter how long it takes that is the secret of their
skill extreme care on each job every task is a work
of art mass production and cheap articles are un-
known so are failures and breakdowns unknown
thus it is-different again

  this chief engineer a brother of the king was the
one who devised the means of sending this message to
earth his method was not divulged to me as it in-
volved a secret process knowledge of which was per-
mitted only to members of the blood royal he is also

going over my space bender but will not have it ready
for me to try the return journey to earth for some
time yet the work could not be loft in better hands

  i received a royal command to attend a state ball
to be given in honor of the marriage of the crown
princess pummas a charming young girl to a power-
ful noble from a distant province with whom she had
fallen deeply in love and who returned her affection
never had i thought possible such splendid toilettes as
these ladies and gentlemen exhibited

  you know how a cat washes and smooths itself
never seeming satisfied with its appearance well this
habit of personal cleanliness born in the feline has
evolved into a vanity surpassing anything you or anyone
else on the earth ever saw

  the men wore silk satin and velvet studded with
all kinds of precious stones the colors were care-
fully selected to harmonize with their complexions

 the women-shades of helen of troy-the
women their gowns were composed of some kind
of cloth actually woven from strands of solid gold
and silver trimmed with the down from young hum-
ming birds breasts iridescent glowing almost afire
with a shimmer of flashing shifting color the scene
completely eclipsed my powers of description

  at this ball a most regrettable affair took place
during dinner one of the men paid too much attention
to a beautiful lady across from me who so i was
informed was engaged to a gentleman beside her
words arose and to my dismay and astonishment the
two men retired to an anteroom where after about
five minutes of furious fighting in full view of the
entirely unmoved company the rightful lover deliber-
ately slaughtered his rival with a large sword literally
hacking the unfortunate man to pieces no one else
seemed to think anything of this least of all the fair
cause of the trouble all went on eating drinking
and conversing in the most matter of fact way

  i was told that these duels were of frequent occur-
rence and were considered quite the conventional way
of settling differences the victor in this particular
combat held a record of three hundred and eleven such
murders to his credit when i add that this amiable
personality was the head of a school for children and
was considered rather too mild in his administration to
enforce the proper discipline need i say anything
further about the ferocity of this race yet they were
not quarrelsome they were deadly as the entire
planet was under the rule of king tabi war was un-
known this was fortunate for the possibility of
organized conflict among such fiends would have been
too frightful to contemplate

  there are interesting things without number which
i might tell you but which i can barely touch on due
to lack of time such are their wonderful diplomacy
having its origin in the stealth of the feline the
marvelous perfection to which the vocal art has been
raised the peculiar custom of expecting children to
fend for themselves at an age when ours are still in
the nursery the great mouse ranches i saw where
mouse boys herded giant rodents with all the glamor
and romance of our wild west and-the list is endless

    it is necessary for circulation purposes

  cated in what cities and from what news-
  dealers they buy perhaps you do not
  realize it but magazines are sold unlike
  any other commodity we put out 
  magazines a month and trust to luck that
  they will all sell every month very fre-
  quently we do not sell more than
   copies the balance will
  then go to waste which we have to
  take back and credit the news-
  dealers cor in order to cut down
  this waste we must know just where
  our readers are located and supply
  the newsstands with only those
  copies where we know a demand
  exists this will save us thousands
  of dollars a year and in turn we can
  well afford to present you with a
  free copy of the vanguard of
  venus

    this story by the way i assure
  you is one of the best i have ever
  read it is a real interplanetarian
  scientifiction story and is different
  from most others of this kind

  vantage of this great offer no
  strings to it

  i have tried to select such facts as i believe instruc-
tive and interesting my engineer friend clamors for
the manuscript which is to be dispatched in his secret
container he says it will take about two months for
it to reach the earth he is waiting beside my desk
so i must bring my account to a close you may
never receive it-i can only hope that you will

  i cannot return to my home and loved ones until
the space bender is put in condition and i receive
permission for my departure from king tabi his
majesty desires to consult the yow-yow or general
council before issuing his royal mandate from sev-
eral hints he has given me however i have no doubt
it will be favorable look for me think of me pray
for me for surely never did mortal man stand more in
need of aid than i do until we meet old comrade
pupil and helper-good-by

forbes laid down the manuscript and sat head
on hand staring into  the fire the date on the
manuscript given in earthly time was over
twenty years ago so the glass bottle has been buried
approximately that long

  twenty years a long while surely in that time
the marvelous machine had been repaired it could
not be otherwise disaster had overtaken his well-
loved friend and employer it was no use to hope it
was finished

  what had happened to him  where was he  had
the king refused permission to return to earth and
was livermore a prisoner on that strange planet

perhaps he had made the attempt and had failed had
been killed or marooned in some totally incomprehen-
sible world of the fourth dimension

  ye gods what an adventure a momentary doubt
assailed forbes perhaps it was a huge joke after
all but no livermore had disappeared and so far
as he could tell the glass bottle and the paper were
entirely new substances he did not know what to
think

  he recalled the strange behavior of his pet cat
archibald when brought near the bottle or the manu-
script could it be that some subtle bond attracted the
creature to these products of his super-relatives  pish
that was arrant nonsense and yet-

  forbes rose knocked the ashes from his long extinct
pipe and walked over to the window which he raised
to admit a flood of fresh cold air the storm had
ceased a shaft of golden sunlight flashed on an oppo-
site window the milkman called to his horse and
jingled his bottles a bell clanged on a distant car
the man across the way opened his door poked out
his head and took in his daily paper it was day
the affairs of the world went on 

	 

  by this time you probably know that the author has
had a little fun with you at your expense but after
all even though this story is an excellent satire why
should there not be a cat-like race somewhere  do we
not have a cat-like man and woman with us already
every one of us has met the cat-man and the cat-
woman why not a whole race-editor

               the end

the fifth dimension

        continued from page 

the previous one we see and recognize this truth
daily in the phenomena of humanity every baby born
starts life a little in advance materially and mentally
of its father this process is very slow and we call
it evolution but it is a perceptible progress neverthe-
less it may be aptly likened to the whorls of a spring
as compared to a mere flat coil of wire the earth
follows an orbit around the sun and every year it is
in the same relative position with regard to the sun
as it was the previous year it has completed one

of its countless cycles but you know as well as i
do that the sun and the earth as well as the other
planets are all farther along in space together there
is a general progression of twelve miles a second on
some vaster orbit this general progression then is
analogous to our possibility of change and growth the
power to better our conditions in other words it is
a fifth dimension

  the wheels of the juggernaut can be turned aside
i said reverently and there is hope

editor amazing stories

  i have noticed that quite a number of the con-
tributors to the discussions column have been
writing about the effect a rapidly moving body
baa upon light such as to raise or lower the color
in the spectrum therefore i am writing you to
ee if you or your readers can explain a few things

speed of sound and of light

  in the first place all motion is relative where-
fore if someone were standing on any body moving
sixty miles per hour and shoot a bullet in the
same direction he was going at sixty miles per
hour then the total velocity of the bullet would be
 miles per hour then if something were moving
in a given direction at a given speed say at the
velocity of light then why would not the light

given off from that body travel with twice the
speed of light in the same way would not the
speed of its source tend to speed up or retard the
speed of sound yet the speed of both light and
sound are always taken to be constart regardless

recent investigations have shown that the first
estimates of the speed of light were nearer correct

since my graduation from your school in

   fords congenial employment at good
   salaries to hundreds of thousands
    who merely follow out its present
    applications these applications are
   innumerable touching intimately
   every business and every product in
   the world the work of the chemist
   can hardly be called work at all
   it is the keenest and most enjoyable
   kind of pleasure the days in a
   chemical laboratory are filled with

 theylaughed when isat down at
 the plano but when i
 started to play-  	

     can he really play i heard a girl whisper
  to arthur as i sat down at the piano

    heavens no arthur exclaimed he never
  played a note in all his life

     then i gave them the surprise of their lives

  i started to play instantly a tense silence fell on
  the guests  i played the first few bars of liszts
  immortal liebestraume i heard gasps of amaze-
  ment my friends sat breathless-spellbound i
  played on

           a complete triumph 

     as the last notes of the liebestraume died away
  the room resounded with a sudden roar of ap-
  plause everybody was plying me with questions
  -jack why didnt you tell us you could play
  like that    where did you learn who
  was your teacher

     then i told them the whole story

  it seems just a short while ago that i saw
  an ad of the u s school of music mentioning a
  new method of learning to play which only costs
  a few cents a day with-

 was amazed to see how
 easy it was to play this
 new way i sent for the
 course and found it as
 easy as abc i before
 i knew it i was playing
 all the pieces i liked best i would soon be able
 to play ballads or classical numbers or jazz with
 equal ease and i never did have any special
 talent for music

 than those of later days thus the speed is fell
 erally taken to be  miles per second instead
 of  now is this speed whatever it may
 be constant or is it negatively accelerated with
 the passing of time as a material body would be

    i fear that i have taken too much of your valu-
 able time to comment upon the stories suffice it
 to say that i enjoy them all especially those in the
 quarterly and those by burroughs

                        charles wilie

 s fannin tyler texas

    studies of the action of light waves taken in
 connection with the einstein theories go to prove
 that the speed of light waves is not affected by
 the motion of their source but you are getting
 into pretty deep water as you will realize if
 you read up on einstein and especially on micbel-
 sons experiments to test out this theory we do
 not know of any direct investigation of the speed
 of sound transmission as it is affected by the
 motions of its source if a shell moving at the
 velocity of sound and away from an observer
 would explode we may suppose that the sound
 would never reach him-editor

 editor amazing stories

     as a continuous reader of the amazing stories
  magazine since the first issue and always an
  enthusiastic buyer of the latest edition i request
  you to place the following interesting article in
  your discussions columns taken from dr
  cranes article in the san francisco call and
  written by dr dinsmore alter of the university
  of kansas-it will undoubtedly be an appetizer
  for some of amazing stories readers imagination
  as it gives me food for thought here it is-

the electronic man

    dr dinsmore alter of the university of
 kansas thinks that the electronic man belongs
 in the list of fanciful beings of human conjecture
 the electronic man is based upon the belief that
 the electrons within the atoms may follow the same
 laws as the planets in the sky for certainly the
 small asteroids follow these laws this gives us
 interesting material for conjecture

    how do we know that in every atom of our
 body there is a miniature world or rather universe
 stars revolving around a central sun living
 beings may exist on these electrons whirling about
 in our thumb nail time was when an atom was
 supposed to be the smallest conceivable thing for
 the word atom means not capable of being divided
 or uncuttable then came electrons which are
 supposed to be even smaller than atoms atoms
 are conceived of s being composed partly of re-
 volving electrons even in solid substances such
 as iron or human skin some of these electrons
 are revolving in their various atoms about a central
 nucleus others are in the nucleus and now comes
 the interesting speculation these electrons being
 miniature worlds like ours have they miniature
 inhabitants

     there is no reason to suppose that sentient life
  is confined to beings like ourselves maeterlinck
  conceived of a soul in bread and in flour etc
  why would it not be possible in some other world
  for souls to inhabit flame or metal what soul
  is nobody knows with us it is certainly within
  the human organism but elsewhere it may not be
  there is no limit also to speculation as to what
  takes place in the microscopical world perhaps
  our world this little planet bears tbe relation to
  the vast cosmos around us and above us that the
  atom in our finger bears to our whole body

     now as a conclusion i would like to make a
 suggestion that there should be more illustrations
 in amazing stories magazine they help con-
 siderably in bringing the story more to life as it
 were the illustrations by paul are indeed excellent

david r thornton

 pacific avenue san francisco calif

     your point about the electronic man is very
 well taken and gives room for endless speculation
 and conjecture there are some famous old lines
 to this effect

     so naturalists observe a flea
     has smaller fleas that on him prey

and these have smaller still to bite em

     and so proceed ad infinitum

dean swift rhapsody on poetry

     this carries out you will see your electronic
  man in the descending direction it is a pity that
  we cannot find a quotation to carry your specula-
  tions up the line for increasing size-editor

a non-readers view of amazing
stories

editor amazing stories

having received the comments of readers in your
discussions department for some many months
you will doubtless be interested in knowing what
non-readers think of your magazine

as a clerk in a drug store selling amazing
stories as well as other periodicals i find that
there are three faults in this magazine in the eyes
of prospective readers the paper the name and
the cover

i do not hear so much about the grade of paper
as i used to so will not comment on this but
merely hope for a better grade in time

as to the name which blazes a path across the
top of the cover like a comets tail i have more
to say the name amazing stories loudly shouts
out i am cheap fiction this doesnt attract the
customer let me tell you the name itself is not
so bad probably as the way it appears in red-
hot blinding combinations of vivid colors that
are almost enough to knock the wind out of a
balloon

the third and biggest fault i find to be the
cover a typical example of what the cover or
rather cover design did to a prospective buyer
happened last night looking over the rack of
magazines a man was attracted by the blinding
searing yellow background of your magazine he
hesitated whether he should pick the periodical up
or not but curiosity got the best of him picking
it off the rack he glanced through the contents
gingerly as though afraid the loud colors would
burn his hands i approached the man as i al-
ways do when someone picks up amazing stories
and told him what a wonderful magazine it really
is how i have read every issue since the first
one and how i would not trade any magazine out
for this one i showed him the discussions de-
partment and then had to go away to jerk a
few sodas when i glanced up i saw the man look
at the cover sadly shake his head and walk out
another sale lost because curiosity which attracts
can not make one buy

for the simple reason that there are more non-
readers than readers i suggest for your benefit
that you put a more conservative cover on your
magazine which would gain you many more readers
the radio news in its july issue had a cover
that attracted and produced sales for you too

if this letter has not yet reached the way of
all superfluous mail and if it gets into dis-
cussion please dont tell me how great an artist
paul is and how many praising letters you received
on his work for he suits me also but if he can
not make you more readers than he has done let
the artist who drew radio news cover work under
paul and draw the covers for amazing stories

if youd try a milder cover on one issue
only and didnt sell  copies more id eat a
corner off our piano

my personal opinion of your magazine is that
it is so wonderful as to be beyond description

i could not find any thing in the skylark of
space to indicate that it was to take place in
the future yet the queer clothes that paul draws
on the characters seems to point this fact out
will you please enlighten me

                  melvin brody

we are very glad to get your comments on the
covers of amazing stories it is a curious com-
ment on human nature that a magazine containing
pages of interesting stories all combining a bit of
science with the requisite romance all selected
from a great number submitted so as to give our
readers the best all most carefully edited the scien-
tific features carefully watched for correctness or
plausibility the phrasing watched for good english
that such a magazine should depend on how much
red there is in the cover or how liberally yellow is
used therein to develop its sale we feel strongly
inclined to give you a chance to try your dentition
and digestive system on the corner of your period
piano amazing stories has shown a healthy
growth in circulation and is now on the upward
path

as regards the skylark of space we certainly
do not find anything very futuristic in the cos-
tumes given the characters and as the fair sex
are dressing in this vicinity at least we are in-
clined to consider the clothes rather old-fashioned

as regards the name of amazing stories it
is a pretty serious thing to change the name of a
so widely known periodical but we have long
had in mind the possibility of doing so so there
is no knowing what may happen eventually and
we cannot end our comments without letting you
know how warmly we appreciate your kind interest
in our work-editor

a general and generous
appreciation of amazing stories

mr pauls work discussed

   editor amazing stories

  having been a reader of your magazine for
  many months i feel that at last i may be qualified
  to add a comment or two of my own to the many
  others in discussions

   i do not happen to be a scientist-nor for that
   matter even scientifically inclined-but that does
   not prevent my very cordial enjoyment of the
   scientifiction stories in amazing stories

   i have especially liked such ones as the yeast
   men ten million miles sunward the moon
   pool ihe invisible man the second deluge
   a modern atlantis and in the august number
   your new serial the skylark of space starts out
   very interestingly speaking of the current issue
   philip francis nowlans armageddon- ad
   is one of the most entertaining stories since i
   first became afflicted with the amazing stories
   habit by all means a sequel and that as soon
   as possible

   might i inquire as to the lack-regrettable to
   my mind-of more stories by edgar rice bur-
   roughs while i am unable to criticize or applaud
   -their scientific value because of my own lack
   of knowledge of such subjects his stories carry an
   extraordinary appeal and i should like to see more
   of them in your magazine

   i also see in discussions that mr pauls
   drawings are under fire being an artist of sorts
   i should like to say a word both pro and con
   mr paul has improved mightily in his black and
   white illustrations and it seems to me that there
   is very little lacking in them now but-and now
   i make both enemies and friends-his cover draw-
   ings have failed to keep pace

  it is rather an odd coincidence but i had
  previously refused to read the first copy of amaz-
  ing stories that i later did read because i disliked
  the cover so potently later on i read-and thor-
  oughly enjoyed-that same issue-but not until the
  cover had been torn off i did not realize that
  it was the same magazine until i purchased the
  next months number at a newsstand and recognized
  the same artists work on the cover drawing how-
  ever taken all in all we can very well put up
  with the cover designs for the sake of mr pauls
  pen and ink illustrations

   but then the covers do not make a magazine
   nor break it so heres how for a continued and
   increased appreciation of amazing stories

                            carol hodges

                      euclid avenue at th street
   miami beach florida
   with regard to our cover drawings the condi-
   tions of printing in color is such that they lose in
   the reproductions undoubtedly but if you will
   take the trouble and we are sure it will be a
   pleasure to study out what is shown in them in
   the way of apparatus perhaps or in mechanical
   and architectural structures you will be surprised
   in many cases how much there is to be seen any
   amount of thought is bestowed upon each and for
   our purpose they are certainly superior to a lighter
   effect more picturesque drawing with all science
   left out-editor

an excellent criticism from an
expert

 editor amazing stories

  allow me in my capacity as a professional lin-
  guist to invite attention to the abominable prac-
  tice which some of your writers have of referring
  to the inhabitants of venus as venusians as
  the stem of the word is vener the proper form
  of the word is venerians the following table
  will illustrate my point

  english name of planet mercury venus earth
  mars jupiter latin name of planet nominative-
  mercurius venus tellus mars juppiter geni-
  tive-mercurii veneris telluris martis jovis
  english name of inhabitant-mercurian venerian
  tellurian martian jovian

 i always read your magazine from cover to
 cover and enjoy all the stories having no fayor-
 ites and have no other ault to find with it how-
 ever the occurrence in an otherwise well-written
 story of such an etymological monstrosity as ven-
 usian is sure to jangle on the nerves of those who
 are familiar with the correct processes by which
 new words of this kind should be coined

r p vogenitz

  principal translator p o dept wash d c

  we are very glad to get the better philology or
  stymology affecting the names of supposed inhabi-
  tants of the different planets and we think you
  make a very good case of venerian perhaps the
  writer feels that his communication hardly amounts
  to the dignity of philology and yet he says that
  venusian is an etymological monstrosity-and he
  is quite correct-editor

an interesting letter on life
problems

editor amazikg stories

   this is the second time in my life i have written
to the editor of a magazine you ought to feel
complimented anyhow i am writing to tell you
that i like yes very much like your magazine
amazing stories when one deals with the realm
of thought and feeling as much as i do it is
stimulating to get hold of amazing stories for
an evening beside the fire and after lighting up
the old pipe to delve deeply into the adventures
of the writers who in their own minds their own
imaginations travel the heights and lengths and
breadths and even another dimension of being   
i think that there are an infinite number of
dimensions

   while i am not as yet a subscriber as i am on
the road so much that it is easier for me to pick
up copies at newsstands along the way i expect
to be at home during the winter and then you will
have my full subscription for both the monthly and
the truly wonderful quarterly

   in your editorial the amazing unknown
you make very plain the bounds and limits of hu-
man achievement to date but there is one phase
that you only touched lightly upon rather hinted
at i might say-the soul what do we know
well we or rather some of us do know something
about it but it is my opinion that this knowledge
comes to one as the result of an inner and spiritual
experience rather than a scientific fact that can
be proven step by step in the laboratory

now dont jump at any hasty conclusion about
religious nuts stay around for another paragraph

   here is an amazing suggestion for you   
the scientist who wants to study the soul of things
man etc must develop another sense perception

   the trouble has been that the average scientist
who has taken the trouble to speculate on the nature
of the soul has sought some material proof of its
existence matter as we commonly speak of it
does not exist on that plane of expression there-
fore it must remain unknown some might con-
clude not so man has at least one more sense
besides his ordinary five the sense of the per-
ception of spiritual values or what has sometimes
been called the reality that lies behind the material
universe you see now dont you why i cannot
rightly call its the souls discovery a scientific
one it is rather an art one has to develop the
sixth sense that lies dormant within one-every
one

   by the practice of certain methods of mental
discipline the sixth sense can be awakened i have
proved this for myself as many others have but
one cannot prove these things to another one has
to taste and see for himself

   religion is based on this faculty of the percep-
tion of reality but as only a few have the per-
sistence to go ahead with the discipline necessary
religion has been handed on to the masses as a
mere matter of faith the leaders themselves have
lost sight of the vision of the founder of the
religion and this leads to the teaching of faith
etc etc imagine edison for instance asking
people to accept the statement that he had discovered
the electric light he wouldnt get away with it
for very long would he but mankind has been
trained to think of spiritual things as sacred
to the priests or those in authority and their
efforts to make discoveries and to tell people the
truth have been sometimes violently discouraged

   but enough of this now what have we actually
discovered but here i want to say dont take my
word for it please dont just challenge my state-
ment to the point of desiring to test it and then
you too or anybody for that matter can find out
these things for himself

   st man does not really die there is no
death as to what happens after the change
comes dont ask me that i am not going to
tell you all i know find out for yourself you
probably wouldnt believe me

   nd man is a part of an infinite whole he
can knozv this

   rd man is not an absolute free agent this
universe is governed by law obedience to the
law brings freedom of mind and body

   th man will never find peace and harmony
with life and his fellows-and nature until he does
develop this th sense

   well this ought to curl the type on your type-
writer anyhow i thought i would pass this on
for what it is worth do you get that what
it is worth     what would it be worth to
people to know the truths mentioned above every-
thing yes youve said it you would give up
everything to solve these problems so would i
in fact i did

   as long as the discussion columns have been
 running each letter has received editorial comment
 with a single exception we think perhaps it
 would be well to use this letter to supply a second
 exception because we cannot comment on it its
 psychology seems at once deep and well put while
 much that is interesting in the way of psychology
 has been developed in our stories we think that
 this correspondent in his most interesting letter
 goes quite beyond or perhaps deeper than anything
 we have published so we will let the letter do
 what it is very well able to do namely speak
 for itself we understand that our correspondent is
 a teacher and his letter certainly shows much
 thought-editor

the old and the new school of
fiction fantasy against possibility
in fiction

  editor amazing stories

    having picked up a copy of the may issue of
  science and invention magazine which con-
  tains the synopsis and closing instalment of into
  the th dimension by ray cummings in the
  bunk car of a bridge outfit where i am endeavor-
  ing to recuperate from the results of a fall from
  the girth brace of a bridge outfit it occurred to
  me that it might be a pardonable offense in view of
  the fact that i have absolutely nothing to do and
   hours a day in which to do it for me to burden
  you with a few observations on the subject of the
  so-called scientifiction which i believe origi-
  nated in the work of jules verne and has been
  carried on by h g wells sir arthur conan
  doyle and others

    in my school days i was an inveterate reader
  of this type of fiction as well as of the sherlock
  holmes stories which are the outstanding part
  of doyles work i remember numerous stories
  of trips to the moon by rockets by means of a
  substance which eliminated the force of gravity
  and by drawing the moon to the earth with a huge
  electro-magnet stories of great interest to my
  young mind and which i believe would still hold
  my interest if i read them today because they
  had to do with material things that were reasonably
  within the range of possibility although of course
  the probability of these things coming to happen
  is very small

   i read the invisble man and the time
 machine by h g wells and the poison
 belt and the lost world by doyle and al-
 though there were things in all of them that were
 impossible they were told in a very interesting
 manner and therefore their faults were pardon-
 able

    the time machine in fact was an excep-
  tionally good work because although its subject
  is an impossibility i say this without fear of
  contradiction wells gave us a look at some
  possible social developments of the future which
  may or may not actually come to pass but are
  interesting possibilities

    dr jekyll and mr hyde by robert louis
  stevenson is another very interesting contribution
  to scientifiction because it offers a very amazing
  possibility and because of its excellent construction
  of plot

    of late years however there has sprung up
  either in imitation of the old scientifiction or as
  a result of the american weakness for overdoing
  everything a new school of scientifiction this
  weakness for overdoing things is by no means
  limited when i was in san francisco last winter
  i read a book the name of which i have forgotten
  by an author whose name i have also forgotten
  who takes the title of the american oppenheim
  which contained an account of a war between the
  united states and japan in which the fleets of
  both nations were entirely wiped out and the
  harbor and bay of san francisco were captured
  by the japanese civilian population of san fran-
  cisco and oakland and a great portion of the
  union pacific tracks between ogden and chicago
  was destroyed by japanese spies to prevent the
  american troops from reaching the coast at this
  point i closed the book the strain was too great

    the old scientifiction was founded on the
  theory that whatever is within the bounds of reason-
  able possibility or contained intelligent discussion
  as to future possibilities was good reading the
  new school however seems to base its activities
  on the theory that nothing is impossible

    as a result there has been developed a type
  of story in which no situation is too far-fetched no
  fantasy of the imagination too over-drawn and
  writers vie with one another for the honor of writ-
  ing the most impossible situations into their stories

    one cannot help wondering what will be done
  when the saturation point has been reached when
  the situation has been evolved to a point when
  and where it is impossible to conceive of any-
  thing more impossible perhaps these writers of

hundreds of men are proving

  the new school will then turn their attention from
  the production of absurdities to the development of
  a style of writing which will lend to these ab-
  surdities at least a respectable appearance

    there are of course some writers of scientific-
  tion who do not belong to the new school who are
  able to hold their own without turning mental
  somersaults they are however in the minority

    there may be advanced in favor of these stretch-
  ers of the imagination the argument that there is
  a portion of the public that likes that type of
  fiction to this i am obliged to answer that there
  was a portion of the people a large minority in
  fact that liked its liquor but they have been
  deprived of it just the same

    now i maintain that there is a close analogy
  between the mental intoxication induced as the
  result of reading claptrap and the physical intoxi-
  cation resulting from the overuse of liquor both
  produce a condition favorable to erroneous reason
  ing the only difference being that the former takes
  effect more subtly than the latter and is not so
  easily perceived by others

    the money offered by science and invention
  for proofs of spiritualism astrology and perpetual
  motion seems to be quite safe i am of the
  opinion that had you offered a million in cold
  cash for each it would be just as safe

    it seems to me that of these three bugaboos
  astrology is by far the worst people of more
  than the average intelligence who laugh at spirit-
  ualism and would regard the inventor of a per-
  petual motion machine as insane have fallen
  for the science of astrology and pay visits
  and incidentally dollars to the scientists of
  the profession before making any momentous de-
  cision or entering into a business agreement bar-
  num was certainly right fortunately lincoln
  was also right when he made his remark about
  fooling the people

    in this day and age when the worship of the
  dollar seems to have taken the place of the wor-
  ship of god of science of intelligence or whatever
  it is we ought to worship it behooves us to be
  on our guard against fakers of every kind we
  seem to be cursed with them upon every hand

    i find that this letter has already passed the
  point of saturation half of this ought to have
  been enough

    your idea that the new school of thought be-
  lieves that nothing is impossible is pretty nearly
  correct so many amazing things have occurred
  in the way of scientific achievement within the
  life of the writer of these lines that he has almost
  lost the faculty of astonishment as regards the
  liberal offers held by science and invention for
  proofs of spiritualism we believe they are per-
  fectly safe and our only surprise is that more
  people do not try to win some of them although
  they probably never will-editor

baron muenchhausen and the
atmosphere of the moon

  editor amazing stories

  for some time i have been intending to call
  your attention to a very remarkable blunder which
  you have permitted yourself to make in the march
   instalment of baron muenchhausen i refer
  to statements concerning the atmosphere of the
  moon

        the moons atmosphere    contains 
  percent carbon dioxide  per cent nitrogen and
   per cent oxygen the carbon dioxide caused
  us to cough violently  while the invigorating
  oxygen in its preponderating proportion in the air
  intoxicated us

     yet    the moons air is very thin only
  about  the density of the earths atmosphere
  now since the density of the moons atmosphere
  is given as  of that of earth let the quantity
  of air inhaled on earth be  and the quantity
  inhaled on moon be  then the oxygen inhaled
  on earth is  per cent of or  whilst the
  oxygen inhaled on the moon is  per cent of
   or  consequently instead of becoming
  exhilarated a man or a dog on the moon would
  quickly perish from oxygen starvation

     i read but little fiction but what i have read
  of amazing stories i have enjoyed greatly

                     ralph colling

          polk st san francisco california
  the subject of consumption of oxygen by man
  in breathing the air is touched on in science and
  invention october  page  and elsewhere
  out of  cubic feet of air inhaled a man absorbs
  only va feet of oxygen if he absorbed all the
  oxygen in the air which he breathed our friend
  the baron would have been in a bad way upon
  the moon but the total oxygen required is only
  about one twenty-fifth the volume of the air or
  about lth of the oxygen content of the air
  according to your figures the oxygen on the moon
  would be  or about lth thjt on the earth
  the fractions come pretty close-editor

an error  about light  our
cover illustration

 editor amazing stories

    may i point out at this time an error in your
  answer to mr t leistras letter on page 
  of the august issue you illustrate the theory
  that light has substance by substituting cannon
  balls for light corpuscles in that case you must
  also discover the presence of the cannon balls in
  the same way that you see light-by contact
  hence the idea of luminous bodies is entirely
  out of the question so by traveling faster than
  light-or in this case the cannon balls-the im-
  pacts will take place in a direction contrary to
  that in which you are going and if you are
  traveling away from the source of light in over-
  taking the bodies you will have the sensation that
  they are approaching you hence they will not
  become fainter and fainter but in fact will
  carry out mr leistras theory and appear to
  come from the opposite direction

    in regard to your cover illustrations it seems
  that the main objections are based on the fear
  of other peoples opinions personally i think
  they are ideal illustrations of your new type of
  literature

kenneth bradford

     somerset street west ottawa canada
 your letter is very interesting it is hard to
 be certain what would happen if one would receive
 light waves or light corpuscles when the observer
 was moving at a higher velocity than they possess
 it is more or less of a puzzle and involves some
 features which have not been brought out by
 any of our readers very few people can claim to
 understand the einstein theories in a sense they
 avoid trouble by limiting the possibility of the
 attainment of speed exceeding that of light-

amazing stories

  

years
hence

in  mr hugo gernsback editor of amazing stor-
ies published the first radio magazine the world had ever
seen-modern electrics in one of these volumes he ran
a story entitled ralph c  a romance of the year
 this story although written many years ago proved
more valuable as the years went by because many of the
prophecies he made in this book gradually came true

  this was in the days before broadcasting had even been
thought of and before we had the radio telephone yet all of
this is faithfully chronicled in this story

  old-time readers of modern electrics probably remem-
ber the story and now have a chance to get the complete book

  a pioneer in the electrical and radio field mr gernsback
has a profound knowledge of the subjects coupled with a
finely trained and highly imaginative mind

  this unusual combination has enabled him to foreshadow

with almost unbelievable accuracy some of the more recen
developments his earlier predictions which have appeare
from time to time during the past decade in many newspapers
and magazines are now realities every prophecy is based
on accurate scientific knowledge his ideas are no more fan-
tastic than the realities and commonplaces of our everyday
life would have been to our great grandfathers

  ralphs love for the beauti-
ful stranger his conquest of
his rival and the worsting of
the great saturnine martian
culminating in a running fight
in space with tragedy and
terror conquered by almost
unbelievable and incredible
weapons make one of the
most interesting and gripping
