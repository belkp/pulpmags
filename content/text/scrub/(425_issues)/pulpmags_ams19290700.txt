plan mail coupon for de-
tails of our remarkable offer

only one other man and i
of six taking california
state board examination for
architect passed then i
realized the thorough and
practical training given by
american school in 
months i have gene from
tracer to chief draftsman
in charge of all architec-
tural and engineering work
in one of the oldest offices
here r l warren
los angeles calif

when i started american
school training in the
spring of  i was work-
ing  hours a night seven
nights a week for  
night that fall i got a
job in the engineering
dept of a large firm near
here today  work 
days a week and my salary
is larger than i ever
dreamed of when i began
that course in mechanical
drafting b n ea-
yebns south bend nd

we are looking for more ambi-
tious young fellows with fac-
tory building-trade or any
other kind of mechanical ex-
perience to prepare for and help place in well-paid drafting
positions such men we find are unusually successful as
draftsmen because they know how things are done and thats
a priceless asset to the man who makes the blueprint plans
for theres a great deal more to drafting than mechanical
drawing and reading blueprints the real jobs those paying
 to  a week give you a chance to cash in on your entire
past mechanical experience get in touch with me and ill
tell you how

drafting is logically yonr next move

of course you realize the biggest handicap to mechanical work
is that youre limited in earning capacity to the output of your
two hands as long as you live even the skilled mechanic
earning  to  a week has reached his limit he can never
earn more and when he gets old he will earn less so i dont
blame any man for wanting to get away from his futureless
outlook for wanting to get into something where he can use
his head as well as his hands-where he will be paid for what

he knows instead of only for what he doesyou know

enough about blueprints to understand that plans govern
every move in factory and construction job the draftsman
who makes them is several jumps ahead of the workman who
follows them and so i want you to know that drafting
is a logical natural promotion from mechanical and building
work-better-paid more interesting-just the kind of work
youd enjoy doing

amazing stories



always outside of
things-thats where i
vi as just twelve short
months ago i just
didnt have the cash
that was all no the-
atres no parties no
good restaurants no
real enjoyment of life
i was just getting by
just existing what
a difference today i
drive my own car
have a good bank ac-
count enjoy all the
amusements i please

icouldn t get the good things of life

   then i quit my job and found myself

how does a man go about making more
money if i asked myself that question
once i asked it a hundred times

  i know the answer now-you bet i know
the way good money is made and im mak-
ing it gone forever are the days of cheap
shoes cheap clothes walking home to save
carfare pinching pennies to make my salary
last from one pay-day to the next one i
own one of the finest radio stores you ever
saw and i get almost all the radio service
and repair work in town the other radio
dealers send their hard jobs to me so you
can see how i stand in my line

  but-its just a year ago that i was a
poorly-paid clerk i was struggling along on
a starvation salary until by accident my eyes
were opened and i saw just what was the
matter with me heres the story of just how
it happened

  one of the big moments of my life had
come i had just popped the fatal question
and louise said yes

  louise wanted to go in and tell her father
about it right away so we did he sort of
grunted when we told him the news and
asked louise to leave us alone and my
heart began to sink as i looked at his face

  so you and louise have decided to get
married he said to me when we were alone

  well bill just listen to me ive watched
you often here at the house with louise and
i think you are a pretty good upstanding
young fellow i knew your father and
mother and youve always had a good
reputation here too but let me ask you just
one question-how much money do you
make

  twenty-eight a week i told him

  he didnt say a word-just wrote it down
on a piece of paper

  have you any prospects of a better job
or a good raise some time soon he asked

   no sir i cant honestly say that i have
 i admitted im looking for something
 better all the time though

  looking eh how do you go about it
  well that question stopped me

  how did i i was willing to take a better
job if i saw the chance all right but i
certainly had laid no plans to make such a
job for myself when he saw my confusion
he grunted i thought so he said then he

please s a

held up some figures hed been scribbling at

  ive just been figuring out your family
budget bill for a salary of twenty-eight a
week ive figured it several ways so you
can take your pick of the one you like best
heres budget no  i figure you can afford
a very small unfurnished apartment make
your payments on enough plain inexpensive
furniture to fix such an apartment up pay
your electricity gas and water bills buy just
about one modest outfit of clothes for both
of you once a year and save three dollars a
week for sickness insurance and emergen-
cies but you cant eat and youll have to
go without amusements until you can get a
good substantial raise in salary

  i began to turn red as fire

  that budget isnt so good after all he
said glancing at me maybe budget no 
will sound better-

  thats enough mr sullivan i said
have a heart i can see things pretty
clearly now things i was kidding myself
about before let me go home and think
this over and home i went my mind in
a whirl

  at home i turned the problem over and
over in ray mind id popped the question
at louise on impulse without thinking it
out everything mr sullivan had said was
gospel truth i couldnt see anything to do
any way to turn but i had to have more
money

  i began to thumb the pages of a magazine
which lay on the table beside me suddenly
an advertisement seemed almost to leap out
at my eyes an advertisement telling of big
opportunities for trained men to succeed in
the great new radio field with the adver-
tisement was a coupon offering a big free
book full of information i sent the coupon
in and in a few days received a handsome
-page book printed in two colors telling all
about the opportunities in the radio field and
how a man can prepare quickly and easily
at home to take advantage of these opportu-
nities i read the book carefully and when
i finished it i made my decision

  whats happened in the twelve months since
that day seems almost like a dream to me
now for ten of those twelve months ive had
a radio business of my own at first of
course i started it as a little proposition on
the side under the guidance of the national

 you saw it in amazing

radio institute the institution that cave me
my radio training it wasnt long before i
was getting so much to do in the radio line
that i quit my measly little clerical job and
devoted my full time to my radio business

   since that time ive gone right on up al-
ways under the watchful guidance of my
friends at the national radio institute thev
would have given me just as much help too
if i had wanted to follow some other line of
radio besides building my own retail busi-
ness such as broadcasting manufacturing ex-
perimenting sea operating or any one of the
score of lines they prepare you for and to
think that until that day i sent for their eye-
opening book id been wailing i never had
a chance

  now im making real money louise and i
nave been married six months and there
wasnt any kidding about budgets by mr
sullivan when we stepped off either ill bet
that today i make more money than the old
boy himself

  heres a real tip you may not be as bad
pff as i was but think it over-are you sat-
isfied are you making enough money at
work that you like would you sign a con-
tract to stay where you are now for the next
ten years making the same money if not
you d better be doing something about it in-
stead of drifting

   this new radio came is a llve-wire field of
golden rewards the work in any of the
p different lines of radio is fascinating ab-
sorbing well paid the national radio insti-

                smith stepped into the room for the first time in his life he was face to face with jerome
           cardan

                 expected you several years sooner said cardan sit down

                i will try to be quicker in the killing business returned smith in the meantime what do
            you think of blavatskys secret doctrine

                 it is the only complete book of real knowledge in the english language came the emphatic
           answer

                 you are almost as fantastic as your namesake jerome cardan the italian savant who died
           in home in  remarked smith lazily rolling another cigarette

               cardan spoke as if he were addressing a child i am the italian savant who died in rome
          in  he stated it was because my treatise de subtilitate was so little understood that i
          ceased to be a follower of vishnu and entered the service of siva

appreciation of the common

  by t oconor sloane phd

he essence of life is in appreciation and appre-
ciation applies to all that is going on about us
it should take the form almost of astonishment
a locomotive engine dragging its great train of
pullmans across the country sends a thrill
through the observer if he is in any degree
appreciative although he may know that it is
bad engineering from the standpoint of efficiency the accelera-
tion of a heavy electric train which in a few seconds goes from
rest up to forty or fifty miles an hour is seen every day in
the subway by crowds of people who are very much more
anxious to get home or to their offices than they are to notice
this wonderful exhibition of power the writer once excited
emotion perhaps unpleasantly in an acquaintance by saying
that he was astonished every time he crossed the river in a
ferry-boat but to one who has sailed on the same river in
a twenty-foot catboat and has struggled against a head-sea
close-hauled the ferry-boat majestically driving through every-
thing as if waves were unknown and heavy seas were null
is a wonder the way the boat is built the steel plates with
what may be termed hermetic joints held together by rivets
heated up nearly white-hot and headed while hot so that their
shrinkage operates to tighten the joints the steel frame its
members bent accurately into shape stiffening the hull and
the perfectly working thought uneconomical steam-engine driv-
ing the screws one at the bow and one at the stern its width
four times or more the length of the little sail-boat if this
is rightly considered it is a miracle of engineering it is none
the less a miracle because something better is imminent-
namely the internal combustion engine

  it is the very idea of amazement which appears as the
basis of a play which has excited some interest in the literary
and theatrical circles the hero in this play adopts electricity
and the dynamo as his gods and in the end is killed by the
very dynamo which he almost worships the same idea inci-
dentally was used by h g wells in his story lord of the
dynamos which appeared in a recent issue of amazing
stories	r

  this brings us once more to the appropriateness of the name
of the magazine viewed from this standpoint amazing
stories seems singularly well named the stories in it give
the development of the past and present of science and its
possible future development in many cases stories of this
type might rank as impossibilities but what has been done in
the last fifteen years in the way of scientific progress teaches
us to be very slow to pronounce an unachieved advance in

science or an excursion into the distant future to be an embodi-
ment of impossibilities

  imagination plays a large part in scientific investigation and
discovery astonishment waits upon the announcement of great
scientific work inventions and discoveries familiarity with
the great things that have been done in the properly organized
scientific mind breeds no contempt the ferry-boat in the
golden gate of san francisco or on the hudson river of
new york embodies in its construction and action wonders
enough to supply material for an epic poem the locomotive
with several hundreds pounds pressure on every square inch
of its boiler surface and delivering a great part of this pres-
sure into the cylinders back of the pistons with its train of
cars undre perfect control by its airbrakes is a wonderful
object and of a type which never ceases to be wonderful

  and so we go down the line and find wonders everywhere
at one end the enormous mechanical and electrical develop-
ments and at the other end the work done by almost infini-
tesimal electricity in the telephone and radio and from the
standpoint of efficiency we have the marvelous animal system
doing so much work on so few calories-one who ceases to
admire and to be thrilled with all this is losing the best source
of astonishment

  men in perfect physical condition can do their work on a
very small ration of food imagine feeding a boiler with
what animals devour what poor fuel it would be yet it
is perfectly adequate for animal life eight men are taken
as approximately representing a horse-power what would
a steam engineer think if you gave him the food consumed by
these men in a day and told him to develop one horse-power
in a steam engine for a day with such fuel

  if we seek for economy in lighting we must go to the fire-
flies of these latitudes which are really little beetles or to the
larger cucujos of south america investigators for years
have been endeavoring to duplicate what these insects do
striving to find cold tight but so far without the slightest
practical success the animal system tells us what we should
aim at doing but no one knows how to do it

  we must let no good authors conception of the future be
too astonishing to be accepted at least as possibilities we must
not hesitate to appreciate the poetry of science and its romance
authors should be given a free rein in using their imaginations
if they fire the souls of their readers some of these may he
led to do great work in the scientific and engineering field


the book of worlds

ey dr mile j breuer

author of buried treasure the stone cat etc

              psychiatrists professor cosgraves case
is a striking study in the compensatory psy-
chosis he perches on the edge of his bed
in a private sanitarium for mental diseases
and coos and twitters and waves a wreath
of twigs in his lips whether he will ever recover his
sanity or not is problematical whether anyone else
will ever be able to understand and use his hyper-ste-
reoscope is also problematical and whether if it were
figured out anyone would ever have the courage to use
it in the face of what happened to professor cos-
grave is still further remote in the realms of doubt
and conjecture

  i have repeated the story for medical men so many
times that i am beginning to see a sort of logical
sequence in things that at first utterly bewildered me
as professor cosgraves chief assistant i was un-
doubtedly closer to him and knew more about his work
and about the mechanism of his tragic fate than anyone
else the physicists who merely went over his ap-
paratus and equations and did not know the man did
not grasp the significance of what happened as did i
who lived and worked with him every day and many a
night

  yes the thing begins to look logical to me now
after it has been on my mind constantly for several
months as no one else has been able to understand
exactly what happened i ought to do my best to render
a consecutive account of events

professor hemingford cosgrave was
the most highly civilized man i have ever known
if mankind is in truth be-
coming more civilized as
time goes on then it is fol-
lowing in the footsteps of
such advanced and refined
examples of human prog-
ress as was my late superior
in the school of physics

he was a small delicate-
iooking man with classical
greek features with very
little physical strength but
with infinite physical en-
durance to spend day and night in his laboratory
for a week on end seemed to produce no deleterious
effects upon him

  when i extol the rare combination of mathematical
genius and experimental ability of this man so well
known i am wasting my breath but the world does
not know so much about his other exquisitely subtle
mental sensibilities he was a poet and an artist he
saw all the beauty in cosmos with a wondering eye
and he was as gently sympathetic as a woman the

reports of famine victims suffering in china disturbed
him at his experiments his student-assistants would
conspire to guard him against the visits of the old sal-
vation army captain who more than once lured him
away from his desk with the tale of some woman or
child in distress he was the last man in the world to
be permitted to witness the horrors that he said he
saw

  a little over two years ago he and i were planning
together a demonstration for his class in quadrics we
had considered making models of some of the solids
with whose equations the class was working but the
time and labor involved in this was almost out of
question under the circumstances i suggested that
the mathematics department of the university of chi-
cago had all of these models already made we solved
the problem by my going to chicago and photographing
these models with a stereoscopic camera the prints of
the strangely shaped solids viewed in a stereoscope
were quite as satisfactory for class purposes as would
have been the models

  i had brought the pile of cards to professor cos-
grave for approval he had run through three or four
of them and seemed quite pleased suddenly he laid
them down and stared at me

  do you know what just struck me he asked in a
queer tone

  i shook my head

  you know what im working on he asked

  you mean your expansion equations-

  popularly called the fourth dimension he
smiled at the thought and you know what ive be-
gun to suspect about it es-
pecially since the experi-
ment with the gyroscope 
yes i do-though its
hard for me to grasp that
there really might be an-
other dimension ive always
considered the fourth di-
mension a mathematical ab-
straction

  no abstraction

  he said it as one might
say two and two make four
really something here do you see the connection
now  he shook the stereoscope at me

  i shook my head i felt helpless his mind was
always far ahead of mine he explained

  this instrument takes a two-dimensional figure on a
flat plane and builds it up so that the brain sees it as a
three-dimensional solid in space

he waited for me to grasp his idea which i still
failed to do he smiled indulgently

  if the fourth dimension is really a dimension and

 rhe appendix and the spectacles and
 the captured cross-section both by dr breuer
 brought in a considerable amount of comment this is
 the third story in that series although it can easily stand
 on its own merit this series assumes added interest when
 we read dr brcuers reason for writing these stories we
 quote him  which i wrote largely because i didnt
 like mr olsens treatment of the subject of the fourth di-
 mension this ought to furnish plenty of new material
 for the discussions columns unless we miss our guess


            on the following day i had no classes and i hurried to his laboratory he was already there spinning dials feverishly and
            then bending over the leases he had an unusual nervous air about him destructive rays i he said as i came in deadly

 gases diabolical inventiveness




amazing stories

not a mathematical abstraction- he smiled confiden-
tially as he emphasized the if can we not build a hy-
per-stereoscopic instrument which will build up a three-
dimensional model of a fourth-dimensional object into
an image perceptible to the brain in its true four-dimen-
sional form

  i continued to stare blankly from him to the stereo-
scope and back again

  as a matter of fact he continued our three-
dimensional world is merely a cross-section cut by
what we know as space out of the cosmos that exists
in four or more dimensions our three-dimensional
world bears the same relation to the true status of
affairs as do these flat photographs to the models that
you photographed surely you can grasp that from our
equations 

  yes i assented eagerly glad to find familiar
ground to rest my feet on just as the present time is
a cross-section of infinity cut by a moving space-sector
whose motion is irreversible it moves in one direction
only

  he beamed at me for that then in silence he finished
looking over the geometrical stereograms and handed
them to me

  he spent six months working out his idea on paper
he did not discuss his plans with me very much but
he did give me sections of the problems to work out
for instance he asked me to work out the equations
for the projection of a tesseracoid

ciw  cx  cy  ctsl  k

from eight different directions each opposing pair of
right angles to the other three pairs most of the prob-
lems he gave me were projection problems but beyond
that i could not grasp the drift of his work

  then he spent a year in experimental work as i
am a mathematician and not a laboratory man i had
less to do with the actual construction of the hyperster-
eoscope but even there i helped i worked at the
refractive indices of crystals that he made in an elec-
tric furnace and i worked out the mathematics of a
very ingenious instrument for integrating light rays
from two directions into one composite beam

  apparently the thing was a complex job profes-
sor cosgrave spent three weeks in the research labora-
tory of the mechanical engineering department he
went to chicago and remained there for a couple of
months leaving as his address the psychology depart-
ment of the chicago university one day he an-
nounced to me calmly that the hyperstereoscope was
finished

  may i look i asked eagerly expecting to be
able to see out into the fourth dimension

  the instrument was pointed out of the window at
the campus it had three telescopes arranged in the
form of a triangular parallelepiped one end of the
room was full of apparatus electron tubes and photo-
electric cells a scanning disk and tangles of wire
strung between boxes and cabinets faced with dials and
meters at a small table there were two oculars to
look into i put my eyes to them

it made me dizzy it looked like rolling vapors-

dense heavy vapors and boiling clouds rolling and
turmoiling swiftly and dizzily it looked vibrant with
heat through a rift here and there i got glimpses
of a glowing liquid like the white-hot metal in a foun-
dry coming from the ladle there were boiling bub-
bling lakes of it i shrank away from the instrument

  what is it i gasped

  im not sure returned professor cosgrave pro-
longed observation and correlation of observed data
will be necessary before we can explain what we see

  he was whirling dials rapidly i looked again
there were vapors but they were thin spirals and
wisps mostly there were bare smoking rocks there
was a bleak insufferably dreary stretch of them ex-
tending on into the infinite distance it looked hot
it was infinitely depressing i didnt like it

i stood for a long time behind professor cos-
grave as he sat at one little table with his eyes to
the oculars of the instrument and twiddled the dials
i was about to turn around and slip out of the room
and leave him to play with it alone when he sat up
suddenly a new idea had struck him

  beyond a doubt these places that we see are regions
of some sort not in our space at all or else infinitely
far away but in the direction of the fourth dimen-
sion they are quite near us just as if you are in a
window on the top story qf a skyscraper office building
and a dozen feet away is a man in the window of an
adjacent building to your three-dimensional vision
he is quite near you but to your body whose motion
is confined to two-dimensional surfaces your friend
is a long distance away to your touch instead of a
dozen feet away he is a quarter of a mile away that
is how far you have to travel before you can reach
him

  or if i make a mark at each end of this sheet
of paper and then bend the sheet double from a three-
dimensional standpoint the marks are a millimeter
apart but from a two-dimensional standpoint they
are thirty centimeters apart

  this stereoscope sees across in the same way to
some other universe

  he shook his head

  my analogies are poor it is a difficult idea to
express but look

  i went to the eye-pieces there was water it was
endless just water it swelled and rolled and pul-
sated a swing of the telescopes over at the window
brought into view some black rocks over the rocks
was slime a slime that flowed and rounded itself
into worm-like forms it was hideous i left the
gloating professor cosgrave and hurried away

  after that as my recollection serves things moved
rapidly i saw him a couple of days later at his
stereoscope

  i have it he said elatedly when he saw me i
hastened to look into the instrument

  no he exclaimed pulling me away i mean an
analogy like points on the leaves of a book you
see 

  i nodded he continued
the book ob worlds



  points on the adjacent leaves of a book are far
apart considered two-dimensionally but with the
book closed and to a three-dimensional perception
which can see across from one page to another the
two points are very near together you see

  i nodded again

  now look

  i saw a dense swamp among huge trees with broad
rich green leaves gigantic saurians stalked about and
splashed hugely

  it is like a story of evolution i couldnt help
remarking

  he nodded in satisfaction and mused on

  each of these must be a separate and distinct world
i can go back and forth among them at will it is not
a continuous story there are steps definite jumps
nothing between i can see any one of them at any
time like the leaves of a book

  i looked again the professor had not touched the
setting and the scene was exactly the same a huge
saurian was devouring some living creature from the
water the water was threshed into a pink foam and
light-red blood was splashed over the green foliage
the professor was talking

  what we see is worlds or universes arranged side
by side in the fourth dimension like leaves in a book
 heavens what an encyclopedia

i see i said slowly not sure that i really did
like serial sections cut in a microtome
comparable but not really sections separate
worlds three-dimensional worlds like our own side
by side each of them one page ahead of the preceding
three-dimensional leaves in a four-dimensional book
it was a little difficult to grasp i thought a while
id like to have carver of purdue see this i said
do you remember his article in the scientific monthly
about your four-space equations it was almost per-
sonal ill-becoming to a scientific man id give my
shirt to see his face when he sees this lets bring
him down

  professor cosgrave shook his head

  what object can there be in causing the man any
unpleasant feeling the world holds enough unpleas-
ant situations without our multiplying them i shall
break the news to him pleasantly when the opportunity
presents itself

  that was typical of professor cosgrave that is
just how considerate and sympathetic he always was
always he was trying to spare other people unpleas-
antness or discomfort the man was wasted on our
present-day selfish and discourteous age he ought to
have been born into some future utopia

what would he do now i wondered there
was obviously a vast number of worlds to ob-
serve it would take a lifetime to have a good look
at each one of them would he spend his time on
satisfying his curiosity and turn his back on mathe-
matical physics he still had numerous important
problems ahead of him in the latter field he was
barely started on his career as a mathematical physicist
yet the world was expecting great things of him

  however for the present there was apparently one
phase of the purely observational pursuit for him

  the leaves in this book seem to be arranged in
absolutely orderly succession he said by chance
i began at the end where the evolutionary development
was lowest by swinging my visual field through the
unknown dimension in one direction i can see the
worlds in succession each a little further evolved than
the preceding now im a physicist and cannot af-
ford to waste much time in gratifying idle curiosity
but i must spend a few days or weeks in following
out this evolutionary series before i turn it over to
some biologist this is too much of a temptation
for any kind of a scientific man

  for several days i would come into the room and
see him there with his eyes glued to the oculars too
absorbed even to notice my entrance his attitude
was one of tense and motionless concentration i
would steal out again loth to disturb him once i
came in and noted that he was trembling violently all
over as he gazed into the machine a couple of days
later i found him in the same position as though he
had not moved since i had been there last his whole
body was set and rigid i was alarmed at the way he
looked i stepped closer his jaw was set and his
breathing was shallow

  i felt concerned about him and i made a sound to
attract his attention he started suddenly and leaped
to his feet and turned to me a face that was white with
horror

  ive been a student he gasped a scientific man
i never stopped to realize that men were like that
he sank into a chair his hands on his knees his head
drooped

  i looked into the stereoscope this time there were
men an army stood drawn up with shining helmets
and fluttering pennants extending far into the dim
distance the foreground was red and active every-
thing was splattered with blood men were swinging
swords there were rows of captives and men cutting
their heads off i watched only a second before i re-
coiled but saw a dozen heads roll on the ground and
fountains of blood gush over victims and executioners
alike

  you have no business looking at that i exclaimed

  it was incongruous this delicately organized un-
selfish tender-hearted man to be spending his days
gazing at those things

  its been that way from the beginning he whis-
pered shuddering ever since rudimentary humans
appeared in the series    war brutality cruelty
wanton killing of people   

  but i couldnt keep him away from the thing he
called me to it and explained

  as far as i can understand this i am swinging the
field of view through an arc in a dimension that ex-
tends at right angles to the three known dimensions
at intervals i see a world in between there is nothing
the swing is accomplished by changing the intensity
of the electrical field through crystals of this zirconium
compound which alters their refractivity

  i am going steadily down my scale toward zero


amazing stories

the worlds are getting further and further advanced
in the scale of evolution i can see it clearly now

  in a moment he was back at the instrument com-
pletely absorbed and oblivious of me i was wor-
ried about him i came in daily to watch him and
many a time i came and went without his having been
conscious of my presence there was something
wrong about the thing the intense absorption of a man
of his sympathetic type in scenes of inhumanity such
as i had seen one day when i opened the door he
was facing it waiting for me

  i am nearly at zero look a world much like
ours

  in the lenses i saw the buildings of a city rather
odd but for all the world suggesting london or paris
swarming crowds of people hurrying vehicles it was
quite like our world but just enough different so that
i was sure it was not our world

  professor cosgrave was pale and agitated

cclf ans inhumanity to man he moaned it

  ivj would drive me distracted were there not one
hope just now in that fair city i watched a mob
drag men and women through the streets and stick
their bodies up on poles on a bridge and blood dripped
into the river

  but step by step there is more intellect more ma-
terial progress there is hope that man will eventu-
ally develop intelligence enough to stop his senseless
and cruel fighting and learn cooperation and altruism
each of these worlds seems to bring us a little nearer
to that

  he called my attention as he turned his dials to
zero and looked into the instrument he turned to
me with a queer smile

  look

  i applied my eye again there was the campus and
athletic field the gravel drives and the mens dormi-
tory through the stereoscope or through the window
i got the same view

  at zero we see our own plane of the unknown di-
mension our page in the book you see

  now what i asked

  now negative potential values now to see the
pages ahead of us in the book worlds further evolved
than ours the future up to the limits of the in-
ductance of my coils

  his eyes glowed and his breath came fast

  the future he whispered as he bent over the
oculars and carefully turned his dials in the future
lies mails hope in intelligence and science

  again he sat in motionless absorption occasion-
ally he touched a dial or whispered to himself finally
as he said not a word for a half an hour i tiptoed
out

  the next day i found him staringly expecting my
arrival with wide-open eyes like a man with exoph-
thalmic goiter

  i dont know what makes me go on with this he
gasped men are beasts hopeless they never will
be anything else twenty airplanes went over a city
dropping bombs swept it away it is burning now

in one place i saw through the smoke a small child
hemmed in a courtyard by flames a city as grand as
chicago a sea of smoke and flame he sat with
his head bowed in his hands

  i didnt know what to say he seemed utterly
crushed i could not rouse him finally i led him out
of the room got him in my car and took him home
i pondered on how i might get him away from that
machine for a while

  but the next day he was back again at the machine
i had classes uptil four oclock that afternoon then
i hurried into the laboratory i found a changed man

  he was stern and determined this rather relieved
me for i had been worried about his hopeless depres-
sion and i did not realize what was taking place in the
man it seemed to me then that he had shaken off
the depression and had determined to do something
about the situation of war and humanity

  here is a world thousands of years ahead of ours
he related humanity crowds it densely beyond our
conception thank god it is another world some-
where else and not ours people have not risen an
inch from bestiality in millenia no-stay away from
it i cant permit you to witness such horrors men
and women soldiers piled up in mangled bloody heaps
as high as the capitol building each belch of that
machine kills a thousand more-stay away

it is not our world we can still save our world
from that we start today harlan you and i to
prevent such things from happening in our world
weve got to stop it he said again but he sat
and stared into the instrument

  i was puzzled and not a little alarmed the sudden
stern determination of the gentle little man fitted him
most strangely i would have thought him play-acting
for my benefit had he not looked most terribly grim
anyway i was relieved to see that terrible depression
had left him and that he had got hold of himself
that is what i thought then

  he permitted me to lead him out again and i took
him home he kept saying with grim determination
not to our human race we wont let it happen
on the following day i had no classes and i called
for him at him home early in the morning he had
already left i hurried to his laboratory he was al-
ready there spinning dials feverishly and then bend-
ing over the lenses he had an unusual nervous air
about him

  destructive rays he said to me as i came in but
without looking away from the oculars wither up
a thousand people like snowflakes in a chimney-blast
terrific explosives deadly gases bombs filled with
disease germs diabolical inventiveness

  he whirled around and faced me

  everything indicates that our world is part of this
scheme it is going the same way it will be what
this is we must stop it

he stood up in the middle of the room and talked
and i took the opportunity to peer into the lenses
i saw a dead world wreckage ashes explosion
holes disintegrating bodies nowhere a movement
tqe book of worlds



even vegetable life had withered there was a pile
of bombs ready to fire beside a huge gun and a gunner
lay dead beside them

there was a queer declamatory quality to the speech
that professor cosgrave was making he said queer
silly things about universal peace and yet i didnt
suspect

only the next morning when i came in it dawned on
me he was perched on a tall stool with a wreath of
twigs in his lips as i came in he put the wreath
around his neck and sang in a high key

      i am the dove of peace

      listen to me all men are brothers

      there shall be no more war

      i shall spread my wings over the world

      i am the dove of peace

 tears sprang to my eyes as the truth suddenly
dawned upon me i gulped as i hurried to another
room to telephone poor professor cosgrave

  then as they led him out i looked into the lenses
there was a rugged stretch smooth gently undulating
holes and hummocks as far as the eye could reach
covered with a slimy disgusting fungus growth here
and there the fungus covered a ragged shape suggest-
ing the ruined wall of a building there was no change
in this scene during the four days before the machines
batteries ran down for i did not know how to shut
it off now no one knows how to operate it

  professor cosgrave knows me he is always glad
to see me at at his room at the sanitarium but he
talks to me only about universal brotherhood and
about my duty to save mankind from strife and blood-
shed and he flaps his arms like wings and coos

        the end

after  years

by stanton a coblentz

tffhat will our world be like  years from
 now judging by llie strides that we are now

me superperfect bride

hy bob olsen

author of four dimensional robberies four dimensional surgery etc

ow would you like to marry a woman who
is absolutely perfect in face and form
asked doctor goddard

is there such a woman broderick
doubted

  judge for yourself he pressed a button and
as if operated by the invisible hands of spirits the
green curtains at the end of the room parted and
swayed open

  astounded beyond measure by the unexpected sight
which met his eyes broderick sat for a moment of
pulseless rapture then a sudden throbbing of arteries
he leaned forward his eyes bound as if by invisible
wires to the female form which the open curtain had
disclosed

  she was nude and yet not naked since the heavy
profusion of lustrous yellow hair which fell to her
knees clothed her in a garment more modest than a
bathing suit

  held as if by some mesmeric power broderick re-
mained seated until the curtains mysteriously and
silently fell together then he rose to his feet and
with the steps of a somnambulist faltered toward
goddard

  open the curtains again please i didnt have time
-oh please let me see her again wont you let me
push the button myself

  go ahead but dont blame me for what happens
at brodericks touch the
green curtains again swayed	v

open a cry of disappoint-
ment escaped from his lips
-the alcove beyond was
empty

be patient importunate
youth goddard interposed

you shall see her again in
half an hour perhaps you
may even be permitted to
kiss her hand only give
her time to dress and now
about the answer to your
question  do you think

there is such a thing as a 

perfect woman

  perfect  she is superperfect ive never seen any-
thing in sculpture or painting to compare with her it
is impossible to believe that such a lovely creature could
have been born she must have been created full-
grown by a god who models with flesh

  you are right said goddard she was not born
but created and i am her creator

  you her creator what do you mean

  just what i said i made her what she is shall i

 fnly a few years ago even when the famous fannie
 brice acquired a roman or was it greek nose some
 people laughed and poked fun at the idea and there were a
 goodly number of people who thought it was unbelievable
 and impossible yet today plastic surgery is an established
 art and has made remarkable strides the science of graft-
 ing parts of the body has also reached a definite status it
 does not require a wild imagination therefore to picture the
 possibilities which would result from greater perfection of
 each or a combination of both much might be done in the
 near future we think the authors ideas on the subject are
 decidedly provocative of argument-both for and against
 and even if you dont want to argue the superperfect
 bride furnishes a surprise ending that alone makes the
 story worth reading

tell you how i did it it may be some time before
eve is ready

  yes yes tell me i beg of you

  as you perspicuously remarked a moment ago it
is impossible for a perfect being to be born nature
produces many handsome things but none of them are
absolutely flawless go into the garden and select the
prettiest blossom you can find a careful examination
convinces you that it is absolutely perfect but scrutinize
it through the penetrating lens of a microscope and you
discover countless blemishes and irregularities of out-
line which would bar it completely from the realm of
artistic perfection

  as with the tiny flower so with the big things in
the world of beauty gaze upon a wonderful land-
scape so stupendous so enchanting that to the casual
observer it seems the utter climax of perfection but
the discerning eyes of the trained aesthete would find
it lacking in unity balance and harmony as a scene
it may be beautiful but as a picture it is full of faults
of composition exaggeration in coloring incongruities
of structure and over-vividness of detail

  no artist dares to paint a landscape exactly as he
sees it his mission is to select to modify to recom-
bine and thus from the parts which nature offers him
to construct a complete unified beautiful whole

  poe brings out this idea in his story called the
domain of arnheim youve read it no well
you ought to its a master-
  piece of descriptive diction
it tells about a man with
the soul of an artist and a
poet the fortune of a
croesus and a fervid pas-
sion for happiness he em-
ployed a portion of his great
wealth in constructing a
garden in which every in-
dividual nook and vista
offered to the eyes of the
observer a beautiful and
artistically perfect pic-
ture this he accomplished 

	  	through an exalted form of

                         landscape gardening using
all the individual units just as they occurred in nature
but eliminating recombining rearranging and supple-
menting according to the absolute laws of art

  the wealthy landscape gardener regarded this as the
realization of the highest ideal of beauty i do not
agree to my mind aesthetic perfection can only be
attained by a single unified object which is small enough
to be taken in with a solitary glance and yet rich in
infinite details of form and coloring so that the eye

   doctor goddard anticipated brodericks decision almost to the minute he bad everything in readiness for the first operation




amazmg stories

while keeping the lovely whole ever focussed on the
retina is constantly discovering new elements of beauty
to admire of all individual objects in the universe
there is none so capable of variation of beauty and
ugliness as the human body especially the body of a
woman

tor centuries sculptors and artists have striven to
r delineate human forms of consummate beauty yet
none has fully succeeded the nearest approaches to
perfection have been achieved by those who used com-
posite models combining the face of one with the torso
of another and the limbs of a third

  even with this method the results produced have
been far from faultless witness for instance the
learned criticism of the classic example of feminine
grace the statue of the venus de medici edwin chad-
wick a noted scientist and connoisseur says that the
venus de medici is lacking in two most important attri-
butes of human beauty-health and mentality her
chest is too narrow indicating insufficient development
of the lungs her limbs are without evidence of due
training of the muscles and her cranium and face are
deficient in all traits of intellect

  were it possible for the sculptor to produce a flaw-
less model of a womans figure he is still woefully
handicapped since he can only represent form without
color or any other attribute of the living being the
painter has the advantage of being able to impart the
hues of nature by skilful shading he also gives his
flat canvas a third dimension suggesting solidness
and elegance of contour

  but neither the painting nor the statue can depict
one of the most important attributes of living beauty
namely motion to be perfectly beautiful a creation
must have the breath of life and the power of locomo-
tion bryon was right when he said

     ive seen more living beauty ripe and real
     than all the nonsense of their stone ideal

  he forgot though the fact of which you seem
cognizant that it is impossible for blind nature to pro-
duce anything which possesses complete and faultless
pulchritude unlike a poet the perfect venus must
be made not born

  it is to the creation of this lofty ideal of a living
moving intelligent woman absolutely lovely in body
and mind that i have dedicated my lifetime of artis-
tic and scientific research and my entire fortune you
have just seen in eve the realization of this great
ambition

  he paused a moment to observe the effect of his dis-
course on his young listener broderick had followed
him with a fluctuating petulant interest now he
eagerly cried you said i might see her again-
that i might kiss her hand

  yes yes but pray be patient shes not half ready
yet to receive you arent you interested in the process
of her creation

  indeed i am but only let me see her for a moment
then ill gladly listen to you

  slightly offended goddard lapsed into a moody
silence

  broderick got up and paced the length of the floor
three successive times-then exclaimed for gods
sake speak i cant stand this suspense tell me
more about eve

  please be seated and compose yourself you want
to know how i accomplished this great and wonderful
task hasnt a possible means suggested itself to you
i was obliged to waste a great deal of time in futile
study observation and experiment before i arrived
at the right solution

  at first i thought i could encompass my purpose
through eugenics which is nothing more than the ap-
plication to the human race of familiar rules which
have been practiced for centuries in the scientific breed-
ing of other animals but the fault with this method
is that although it is possible to develop strongly
some peculiar or characteristic variation it is not so
easy to remove completely those irregularities which
make an organism imperfect

  take a specific instance let us assume that we
have found a woman whose only flaw is a small nose
we may mate her with a man who is nearly perfect
except for a nose which is a trifle larger than it should
be from this union we might expect to produce a
child with a well-proportioned nose but we can have
no assurance that the progeny may not have a nose
which is either larger than its fathers or smaller than
its mothers then too the matter of sex variation
introduces an element of uncertainty and worst of all
experiments of this sort require an inordinate amount
of time besides being attended by overwhelming dif-
ficulties the nature of which you can readily surmise
broderick became restless again yes but eve he
rudely interrupted

  im coming to her in just a minute she is what
might be called a synthetic woman she was made
by combining the complete living parts of no less than
twelve different women

  aghast broderick stared at him i dont under-
stand you he stammered

  you must have heard of bone grafting homoplastic
transplantation and other marvels of modern surgery
perhaps you are familiar with some of my attainments
along that line

  i remember reading about a girl whom you treated
after her face was badly burned didnt you cover
her cheek with the skin taken from her thighs

es that is a very simple operation those in-
x volving the transplanting of organs and limbs are
much more difficult yet not impossible to the surgeon
who knows his trade as early as  debert suc-
ceeded in grafting the lower leg of one dog to the
thigh of another in such a way that it appeared per-
fectly normal it was even before that time that lexer
using the method of juxtaposition transplanted the en-
tire knee joint of a child but more wonderful still is
the work of alexis carrel who you know invented a
method of joining large blood vessels by clamping
them to stop the flow of blood and then sewing them
superperfect bride



together with silk thread i have conducted a large
number of experiments on animals and human beings
and have improved the methods of lexer debert and
carrel

  but i am more of an artist than a surgeon surgery
is my vocation and art my avocation it therefore oc-
curred to me that by combining my artistic taste and
my surgical skill i could model in flesh and bones
just as the sculptor models in clay taking another
hint from the artist i resolved to create a living
woman of unsurpassed beauty by joining together parts
which though taken from imperfect individuals were
themselves free from flaw

  of course it was necessary that the greater part of
my composite woman be taken from one body since
it is of course extremely difficult and dangerous to make
many alterations in the so-called vital portions of the
human anatomy-the head and the torso my first
task therefore was to find a woman who embodied
perfection in these essential parts

  i finally discovered in the person of a young woman
for whom i set a broken leg all the qualities which i
required by good fortune she like yourself was an
orphan with no near relatives living she had an in-
dependent income of about eighteen hundred dollars
a year a well-known university had granted her a
bachelors degree although she was only seventeen years
old her interests were mainly for art literature and
music but she had also done work in science and
philosophy she was very fond of all forms of outdoor
sport in fact it was while skating that she sustained
the injury which first brought her to me

  her torso her neck and her head were absolutely
perfect although the other parts of her body were
susceptible to improvement you may fancy the
delicacy with which i broached my purpose to her
finally by appealing to her devotion to art and to the
feminine ambition to surpass all others in beauty 
won her consent she became my adopted daughter
and the heiress to my entire estate

  i began by providing eve with a new head of hair
her own hair was pretty enough-a glossy amber
brown-light and fluffy-but bobbed as is the case
with nearly all women today the scalp she now wears
used to belong to a norwegian servant girl from
whom i bought it for five thousand dollars giving her
eves hair in exchange when ingemar recovered and
found that she still had a full head of growing tresses
she was immeasurably pleased she said her long
golden hair had always been too much of a bother to
her anyway and she liked her new hair better

  in a similar way i exchanged eves imperfect parts
for flawless members from other girls who consented
to the transfer for considerations varying from one to
twenty thousand dollars her ears belong to an eng-
lish girl and her lips used to grace a french beauty
-but her nose is her own i merely remodeled it a
trifle reducing its size by removing portions from the
inside

  i got her left arm from a girl who is an expert
swimmer and her right from one who loves tennis
but hadnt played enough to overdevelop it two

dancers chosen from among five hundred chorus girls
supplied her legs at ten thousand each i found it
easier to induce two women to trade each a leg than
to get one to take the risk of sacrificing both limbs
besides it very rarely happens that both arms or both
legs of any one person are perfect mates

  the feet belonging to this pair of legs i could
not use they were too deformed by the combined
effects of tight shoes and walking on the toes it was
exceedingly difficult to find two perfectly formed feet
those accustomed to being imprisoned in modern shoes
were cramped and abnormal while the feet of european
peasant girls who had always gone barefooted were
too coarse and large i solved the problem by selecting
a girl who had always worn sensible shoes and having
her go barefooted for two months before i operated
on her

  i had the hardest job in obtaining a perfect right
hand her left hand i bought from a masseuse who
was willing to sell her other one also but i couldnt
use it on account of a tiny scar on her little finger
finally i found a perfect mate to her left hand on the
person of a musician she refused to sell her hand at
any price and i actually had to kidnap her when she
discovered that i intended to take her hand by force
she agreed to submit voluntarily for twenty thousand
dollars four months after the operation she was
able to play the piano as well as ever it was just six
weeks ago that i put the finishing touches to my master-
piece now eve is completely perfect

  you speak of exchanging member for member
said broderick i dont understand how you can do
that

ty assistant doctor mann and i work together

  jv he removes the member from eve while i am
separating the corresponding part from the other
woman every incision and cut made by me is re-
produced with mathematical exactitude by him so that
the surfaces of the severed portions are precisely iden-
tical in outline then while the members are still warm
and living they are exchanged and attached by methods
with which every surgeon is familiar while i am
fastening the new part to eves body doctor mann
performs a similar operation on the other girl in a
month both have complete and perfect use of their
new limbs

  but surely all this horrible cutting and slashing
must leave some marks

  why so havent you ever cut yourself with a
razor and watched the wound heal in a week or
two the skin over the injured place cannot be dis-
tinguished from the rest of your face it is thus that
the skin grows over the places where the parts are
joined together you shall see for yourself eve must
be ready by now he pushed the button and once
more the curtains spread apart

  the woman who stood in the opening was attired
in the flowing white draperies of greek antiquity
except for light corded sandals her feet were bare
her hair was parted in the middle and was gathered
in a high roll at the back of her head from which fell


amazing stories

a thick cluster of curls it seemed a perfect picture

  at a gesture from goddard she stepped forth every
movement a reflection of superb elegance and grace
combined with a singular suggestion of alertness and
power

  eve said goddard let me present mr charles
broderick

  she inclined her head slightly and held out the
faultlessly manicured hand of the masseuse broderick
took it as if it were a piece of priceless fragile china
the mere contact of her warm magnetic fingers sent
through his frame a thrill such as he had never before
experienced

  may i kiss it  he asked in a trembling voice

  a quizzical smile from goddard young man never
ask for a kiss if you want one take it broderick
lost no time in complying with fervid lips to the sug-
gestion of the older man who continued that may
not be sound ethics but its good practical common
sense now see if you can find where that hand joins
on to the forearm

  in vain broderick searched for a scar not a
scratch or blemish could he discover

  here is where i attached her arm said the doctor
running his finger over her bare shoulder ill defy
you to find a mark of the joint and you remember
what i told you about her lips would you suspect
that they ever belonged to anyone else

  never oh that i might kiss those luscious lips
and suddenly jecalling goddards bit of philosophy
concerning osculation he thrust his arm about her neck
and made a sudden effort to kiss her mouth the
doctor stopped him just in time a crimson flood
mantled eves cheeks to the great delight of broderick
who thus perceived that she was really human and not
merely an animated statue

  take your time rash youth the doctor laughed
helen of troy was not won in five minutes eves
lips are not for you-unless-

  unless

  unless you agree to certain essential conditions

  name them

  it is a long story eve knows it already and so
will not be interested you will excuse her while i
explain

  with supple lithesomeness she stepped to the door
brodericks eyes followed her until the curtains closed
behind her

  then he turned to goddard with now for the
conditions

  as you doubtless have surmised i am looking for
a mate for eve but he must be as perfect as she is
since i prefer a college bred man i enlisted the aid
of the physical directors of every large university in
the united states out of over a hundred candidates
sent to me only three have passed the rigid examination
to which i personally submitted them ill speak of the
other two presently

  youve been with me now for a week and my tests
have shown that your health vitality and your intellect
are all excellent you have no physical defects ex-
cept in parts capable of being interchanged

  what i wish to do is to reconstruct your body just
as i have done in the case of eve and thus transform
you into a perfect man this accomplished you shall
marry eve assuming the name of adam goddard thus
i expect to found a new race of perfect beings bearing
my name

  the other two men i spoke of passed in all but the
last crucial test one of them went so far as to allow
me to put him on the operating bench but lost his
nerve with the first whiff of the ether

  it is not necessary for you to give your answer to-
day in fact id rather you would take plenty of time
to decide this is a momentous matter and is not to
be entered into lightly it will be attended by consid-
erable pain and some danger although both these
features will be reduced to the minimum you may
see eve every day if you wish to-morrow evening at
eight-thirty you will be given an opportunity to test
some of her mental powers youll be here

   i certainly shall

  in the meantime take good care of your body to
me it is worth a million dollars

a game of chess

imagine if you can the emotions which surged
through brodericks mind as he strode back to
his hotel

  eve had made a profound impression on him-had
charmed and fascinated him with her incomparable at-
tractiveness but he was not in love with her he told
himself any more than he could be in love with a beau-
tiful statue how could he love a woman with whom
he had not even exchanged two words of conversa-
tion one thing though he could not escape-she
completely dominated his thoughts to the exclusion of
all else preventing him from sleeping that night or
from engaging in any serious occupation the following
day more and more strongly came the realization
that having seen eve the society of all other women
would now and forever seem insipid yet his involun-
tary admiration for her was rudely tempered by two
shocking thoughts one was the domineering influence
which her foster-father exercised over her and the
other was the repulsive notion that she was stuck to-
gether like a picture puzzle or a crazy patchwork
quilt

  repelled as he was by these considerations they
were far outbalanced by the overwhelming force of her
many attractive attributes three-quarters of an hour
before the appointed time he presented himself at the
door of doctor goddards lordly residence

  youre early the doctor greeted him

  am i is eve at home

  yes ill send your card up to her shell be down
in a few minutes youre fond of chess arent you
broderick i judge so from the fact that you repre-
sented princeton in the last cable tournament with
oxford and cambridge ive arranged to have you
play chess with eve this evening if you care to

  broderick suppressed a smile who ever heard of
a woman who could play chess 

  you will remember questioning the existence of a
superperfect rride



perfect woman yesterday as then ill answer-judge
for yourself

  he drew from a corner a small beautifully finished
table with a chessboard inlaid in squares of ebony and
basswood the pieces were of ivory exquisitely
carved the doctor began placing them on the board

  let me see queen on her color isnt it  i havent
played for such a long while ive almost forgotten
ah here comes eve

  brodericks eyes were already fixed on the green
curtains as if loath to miss a single instant of delight
in her loveliness they parted and she appeared bear-
ing fresh causes for wonder and admiration now her
figure was veiled in the graceful folds of a short-
waisted empire gown which smacked of the middle
ages yet suggested the trim smartness of modern
fashion her arms and neck were barer the style of
her heavily massed golden tresses reminded him of the
helmet of minerva she bowed but did not utter a
word as she sat down in the chair which the doctor
placed for her

  white to move and win goddard chuckled and
she immediately responded by leading with her kings
pawn

  broderick played an indifferent listless game giving
more attention to his opponents face than to her
moves but suddenly he woke up to find one of his
bishops in direct line with an unprotected castle with-
out giving the usual careful inspection of the other
pieces he swooped down and removed it from its corner
instantly eve reached across the board and removed
a pawn putting in its place one of her bishops since
this placed his king in check broderick could do noth-
ing else but take the bishop with his knight eve re-
moved the horseman with her queen which was thus
placed in the square next to the king but protected by
a knight

  checkmate laughed the doctor

  by jove so it is thats a new one on me its
almost the same as the fools mate

  a modification of it which eve invented herself
the rook was just left for bait

  she wont catch me napping next time

  the pieces were replaced with the whites on brod-
ericks side of the board there was no more careless
dawdling after that he started out with the fierce
aggressiveness which had won him fame in college
matches but still kept every piece carefully protected
eve played a defensive game anticipating his com-
plex plots with the weird magic of a sooth-sayer and
foiling them with consummate ingenuity he realized
that he had met an opponent worthy of his skill and
for the moment his fascinated interest in this unusual
game overcame the distracting magnetism of her
beauty

  he gleefully felt that he had the upper hand how-
ever and came near venting his satisfaction in a vain
boast checkmate in three more moves luckily for
him he restrained this ungentlemanly impulse for
eve by an unexpected exchange of queens suddenly
broke through his line of attack and put him on the
dejensive

  broderick fought like a cornered lion and finally
won his way out of a precarious hole by a series of
judicious swaps he had one piece to the good and
he knew that any even exchange was to his benefit
finally after over an hour of playing he found him-
self with a rock and a knight while she had only a
single pawn to support her king he moved the castle
to a more advantageous position where however it
did not bear on her king with seeming unconcern she
removed her solitary pawn from the protection of her
king placing it directly in the path of the threatening
castle no sooner had broderick swept the last pawn
from the board than doctor goddard slapped the table
and yelled stalemate she cant move and shes not
in check the game is a draw 

  well so it is he glanced at eve the smile on
her face was not one of triumph he knew by the
glitter in her clear blue eyes that she like himself
was a keen lover of the game and that she played for
the sport and not for the pleasure of winning

  goddard snapped open his watch hello its past
eves bedtime she has to keep regular hours you
know mr broderick will excuse you now my dear
if he wants revenge you can give him a chance some
other time

  without a word she arose bowed to the two men
and gracefully withdrew

  well said goddard whats the verdict

   she certainly knows how to play chess or else im
a dub

  to-morrow if you wish you may have an oppor-
tunity to test her physical skill what is your favorite
outdoor sport

  i have three favorites-skating swimming and ten-
nis

  eve skates and swims unusually well but tennis
will be the best shall we say to-morrow afternoon at
three 

   that suits me all right

a perfect sportswoman

that night in the seclusion of his chamber
broderick was beset by a multitude of unusual
ideas and conceptions some of them felicitous
others distressing the methodical mind of a chess
player he had never expected to find in a woman and
this added another strand to the chord which he felt
binding him to her a woman who can play chess
like that would certainly make a mans home life at-
tractive he wouldnt need to go to the club for recrea-
tion

  thus he reflected showing that he was a true de-
votee of the ancient game of war

   but though her prowess at chess was to him an indi-
cation of superior intellectual caliber yet the mysterious
control which her foster-father seemed to exercise over
her suggested mental weakness broderick even har-
bored a suspicion that goddards own mind had en-
gineered his defeat and that he had merely used eve
as a human tool for translating his thoughts into acts

   fulminated in his brain the realization that he had
never heard her speak was she deaf and dumb surelv


amazing stories

not deaf since she responded immediately to sugges-
tions addressed to her

  at the end of several hours of musing broderick
was certain of only one thing-he wanted to see her
again

  the tennis match took place at the appointed time
on goddards private court eve was more delectable
than ever for she had shed her unnatural air of
statuesque antiquity and was a thoroughly modern girl
of the great outdoors she was attired in a short wide
skirt of white flannel and a low-necked short-sleeved
middy blouse her blond hair was coiled in thick
braids around her head

  doctor goddard acted as umpire calling the score
after each point eve served first she began by
sending a swift twister which fell just inside the corner
of the court and spun along hardly an inch above the
ground

  fifteen love goddard called

  in the other court eve served with her left hand
with equal speed but not quite so much english and
broderick hooked over a neat back-handed lawford

  fifteen all and thus the match progressed with
the honors close to even nearly all were deuce games
and hotly contested eve played a clever heady game
putting unusual cuts on the ball and placing it in out
of the way corners she was constantly shifting her
racket from one hand to the other and seemed equally
skilful with either broderick depended more upon
speed than generalship and won most of his points by
vicious chops and tearing smashes

  at the end of an hour of playing the score stood at
eleven and twelve with eve serving two beautiful
lawfords and a lucky stroke which sent the ball
against the top of the net so that it dropped gently into
his opponents court won three successive points for
broderick then eve made a superb burst of unusual
speed and brought the score up to deuce time after
time he smashed her left-handed serve but each time
she recovered the point from the other court at last
with the score at  vantage out she served a ball
which broderick had no difficulty in returning for sev-
eral minutes the ball danced back and forth over the
net then eve drove a pretty lawford into his back-
hand court immediately following it up to the net by
wonderful footwork broderick reached the ball and
returned it but eve met it at the net and sent it
crashing into the opposite court it bounded fully
twenty feet in the air broderick dashed back and
leaped for the ball meeting it squarely but in doing
so he crashed into the back-stop and fell to the ground
in a heap

  his high lob fell but a few feet on the other side of
the net where his opponent was ready to receive it
she could have easily dropped it in the center of the
court where he could never have reached it but in-
stead she struck it underhand sending a rainbow lob to
the back court it gave broderick just time enough to
regain his feet and send the ball back to her at the
end of thirty more seconds of playing eve misjudged
one of brodericks smashes and sent it into the net

  game and set score thirteen to eleven announced

the doctor broderick that was marvelous playing
broderick leaped the net grabbed her extended hand
and panted thank you for a wonderful game youre
the best woman player and the finest all around sport
ive ever met

  she smiled and bowed in acknowledgement of this
splendid compliment but said nothing

  do you want to play any more this from the
doctor

  broderick who was drenched with perspiration and
still puffing answered ive had enough for today
yes that was enough for anyone i dont care to
have eve over-exert herself now youd better both
hurry back to the house and take your showers

  after a refreshing bath and a change of raiment
broderick joined goddard in the library

  well how do you like her tennis playing

  i certainly enjoy playing with her shes a clean
sport and refused to take advantage of my accident
after beating her i couldnt very well say that she is
an exceptionally good player but its the first time
ive ever played a twenty-four game set

  they conversed for some time then broderick with
an apparent display of embarrassment said theres
something thats been worrying me doctor and im
anxious to know the truth-is eve dumb

  dumb goddard exploded i should say-but as
usual youll have to judge for yourself come around
to-morrow night at eight

the first musicale

hen he arrived the following evening brod-
erick was ushered into the music room

  ive arranged a private musicale or rather
recital eve will entertain us if you care to have her
do so

  id be delighted was the trite response

  the first number will be a piano solo have you any
special preferences in music

  im very fond of grieg

  very well well have the suite from peer gynt

  it was arranged with all the formalities of the con-
cert hall eve was dressed in a modern decollete gown
she stepped to the grand piano and immediately struck
the opening chords of the morning mood the trill
of the lark the ripple of the brook all were marvelously
counterfeited in this superb combination of tones then
followed the lugubrious strains of the death of asefi the
weird oriental cadences of anitras dance and last of
all the grand climax of thundering chords which cul-
minated in the hall of the mountain king

  thank you very much was brodericks sole com-
ment

  next will be a vocal solo the doctor announced
the younger man held his breath in blissful expecta-
tion at last he was to hear her voice he was not
disappointed for her tones were characterized by a
rich mellifluence which appealed to his laymans musical
sense far more than those of any professional diva

  the piece she sang was unfamiliar to him but was
fraught with intricacies in the form of runs and sud-
den transitions from low to high notes which displayed
superperfect bride



unquestionable technical skill it fascinated him but
not nearly so potently as the exquisite lyrical orchid
i love you truly which she sang as an encore

  at the close of this selection doctor goddard arose
and offering a conventional excuse quietly withdrew
left alone with the perfect woman broderick ex-
perienced a singular shyness which was entirely foreign
to his nature for he was usually quite at ease in
feminine society he wanted to pay her a compliment
yet hesitated lest it sound like the adulation of a
sycophant at last he said you have a beautiful voice
miss goddard

  without a suggestion of conceit or feigned modesty
she answered simply im glad you like it but i know
you sing also wont you try this with me

  she opened a sheet of music which was by no means
unfamiliar to him it was a duet in which the womans
voice and the mans took alternate parts finally blend-
ing into a united harmonious appeal

oh love stay one moment oh love stay one moment
one moment of ecstacy thy heart throbbing on my
breast

  lifes long dream is oer lifes dream is oer
  farewell farewell

  so perfectly did their voices blend that an expert
critic would have judged they had practised together
for months several other songs they essayed some
complex some simple some sentimental others hu-
morous

  at last she turned to him with a smile and said
pardon my seeming inhospitableness if i remind you
that my father is very exacting and insists that i retire
promptly at ten i know you wont be offended and i
hope we are good enough friends to be perfectly frank
with each other but before you go i want you to
promise to bring your violin with you next time you
come

  but i play only in a very amateurish way

  we are both amateurs and enjoy our art all the
more because we pursue it for pleasure alone from
your singing i know you have the soul of a musician
youll bring your violin and your favorite pieces of
music wont you

  if you wish and may i see you to-morrow eve-
ning 

  i shall be very glad to have you call to-morrow
the following evening broderick found eva alone
in the music room she rose from the piano bench to
greet him

  father is working at some experiments and asks
to be excused

  a courteous bow was brodericks response but he
did not stultify himself by any insincere expressions of
regret

  i see you didnt forget she remarked anent the
instrument case which he carried

  no i didnt forget much as i hesitate to play be-
fore you please dont be too critical will you

  i dont expect to have anything to criticise shall
we try something right away i just love to play ac-

companiments and she struck the a key on the piano

  imbued with the desire to make a good impression
and inspired by her faultless accompaniments broder-
ick played with a brilliancy and ferver which astonished
himself evelyn complimented him in the most cogent
manner possible by continually asking him to play
more

  at the end of an exquisite strauss waltz she ex-
claimed oh wouldnt that be wonderful to dance to
i wish we could play and dance at the same time

  do you like to dance

   indeed i do i enjoy dancing better than any other
form of amusement

   theres the phonograph he suggested

  and we have the record of that very waltz ill
start it while you roll up the rug

   a moment later the phonograph began to send forth
its regular cadences and eve fluttered into brodericks
arms he was accustomed enough to the feel of a
womans body in close proximity to his but eve was
unquestionably different the fragrance of her hair
the gentle heaving of her womanly bosom the touch of
her fingers on his arm thrilled him with ecstatic yet
pure emotions

  and if she charmed him by her mere proximity her
incomparable skill as a dancer fascinated him though
he danced with original abandon following no set rules
or conventional steps she followed him as if her
muscles were dominated synchronously by the same
nerves which actuated his

   the great clock in the hall boomed out ten resonant
strokes

  the witching hour smiled eve i have a fairy
godfather who is more exacting than cinderellas god-
mother by two hours and unless i obey him i am in
danger of losing the gifts he bestowed upon me

   broderick took the hint and his departure

the proposal

the daily meetings soon became a matter of cus-
tom rather than appointment though her chess
playing her athletic prowesses her music and
her dancing had in turn attracted and charmed him
broderick soon discovered that he enjoyed conversing
with her most of all there seemed to be no subject
in literature art science or philosophy interesting to
him which was not at least passably familiar to eve
he learned that she had been abroad for a year and
had a fluent command of french german italian and
spanish

  one evening the talk turned to john stuart mill
what is your idea of perfect happiness  she asked

  fervently he responded my idea of perfect hap-
piness is to hold you in my arms and press my lips
against yours

  surprised and hurt by his seeming rudeness she
frowned oh you dont mean that its so unworthy
of you

   genuine contrition gripped him no i didnt mean
it exactly that way but if you ask me to paint a picture
of paradise it would include a little six-room bungalow
presided over by the one perfect woman in the world


amazing stories

there would be a lawn and a garden and two or
three youngsters to rush out and meet me when i came
home tired after the days work

   thats a little better

  oh its very commonplace and rather lacking in
ambition i know but im dreadfully selfish and i think
that the greatest happiness comes to a man through his
own home and family now tell me what your idea of
happiness is

  oh ive had such lofty aspirations-altogether im-
possible and impractical i fear if i could only ac-
complish something really big-something which would
be a blessing to all humanity-like the invention of the
radio for instance then i should indeed be happy but
of course that can never be so i do the next best
thing and get all the pleasure i can out of working
with my hands for those whom i love would you
like to see my workshop

  anticipating his assent she led the way to a small
room at the rear of the building here is my room i
consider it more characteristic of me than my sleep-
ing chamber father wont let me have all the ap-
paratus id like for fear ill injure some of my precious
members but i manage to do some work in brass and
leather

  broderick cast interested glances about the room he
was struck with the neat orderliness which nevertheless
did not seem to remove the impression that it was put
to frequent use

  as eve saw him stop to inspect an object lying on
the bench an involuntary cry escaped her a second
look explained the cause the article was a card case
of leather beautifully embossed and broderick was
astounded to see his own initials worked in the cover

  oh i didnt want you to see that i made it for
you to-morrow is your birthday

  why so it is id forgotten it myself how in the
world did you know 

  i got it from the application blank you made out
for father

  it certainly was thoughtful of you i wish i knew
how to express my appreciation may i keep it now 
yes with my best wishes

  thank you and now i want to talk with you
about a matter of great importance to both of us some-
thing which we both must have had in mind right
along though we have scrupulously avoided mention-
ing it you know what i mean

  you mean fathers proposal 

  yes and i want to supplement it with a proposal
of my own first let me tell you that i love you very
very much so much that i can think of nothing else
then i want to ask you if you of your own free will
without thought of the obligations you owe your foster-
father agree to the proposition he made me in other
words do you wish me to submit to the operation
which he purposes to perform on me

  not unless you feel inclined to agree of your own
free will

  but i do feel so inclined id do anything in the
world for you eve

  then it will please me very much to have you do

what father asks of you otherwise i cannot marry you
  and from now on you and i are engaged 

  not yet i have made a promise to father not
until after-

  i shall see him to-night and tell him that the
sooner he starts the better it will please me

the operation

octor goddard had anticipated broder-
icks decision almost to the minute he had
everything in readiness for the first operation
even to the man who was to provide the new member
-a perfect right leg

  the scenes of the operating room were new to
broderick who had not experienced a sick day since
childhood with undisguised interest he watched the
careful preparations and when the sickening reek of
ether reached his nostrils he welcomed it as a har-
binger of new experiences heavy irresistible drowsi-
ness slowly took possession of him then he had the
sensation of falling or rather drifting through space
and finally came a thought-free void

  when he again recovered consciousness he found
himself lying on a bed in a many windowed room
which seemed filled to the bursting point with sunlight
doctor goddard was bending over him

  how do you feel

  oh all right just a little dizzy and sick to my
stomach

  that will soon pass off does your leg ache
this was the first reminder of the reality of the
operation at first he was not sure that he had a
right leg and he had to feel with his hand to make
certain he was surprised at the touch of his bare
skin instead of the bandages he had expected very
cautiously he wriggled his great toe it seemed to
work very naturally

  may i move my leg he asked

  surely you can do anything you want with it
broderick elevated his knee twisted his ankle and
began to kick like a man whose foot has fallen asleep
then he threw back the covers of the bed and sat up

  try to walk on it suggested the doctor and
broderick complied with the tread of a man suf-
fering from a severe attack of the gout five minutes
of cautious limping brought him to a chair here he
sat down and began to examine his right leg with
a puzzled expression on his face he appealed to the
doctor do you know that leg looks exactly like the
one ive been using for the last twenty odd years
goddard smiled it is the same one

  you mean you didnt perform the operation gen-
uine disappointment was echoed by the question

  no i didnt undertake it get into your clothes
and ill explain

  first the doctor continued i want to apologize to
you and to confess that i have deceived you from the
very start eve is not an adopted child but is my own
natural daughter moreover she is not perfect though
she comes as near to it as careful nurture and training
could make a woman as for my scheme for creating
a perfect being that was but a yarn invented for the
superperfect bride



occasion it is accurate enough in theory but i do not
feel far enough advanced to undertake it in actual
practice as yet

  you naturally wonder what it is all about to me
eves happiness is the most important consideration in
the world and i believe that she can only attain hap-
piness through marriage with a man who is all that a
man should be there was just one thing concerning
which i wanted to assure myself and the story of the
perfect woman was the last crucial test this you have
passed successfully and you have convinced eve and
me that you possess the highest form of courage-the
courage which prompts a man to risk life and limb in
the interests of science and human achievement

  now i suppose you would like to see eve you
will find her in the room where you first met her and
before you go perhaps it might interest you to know
that the nude figure you saw that first day was noth-
ing but a life-sized oil painting which was so well done
and so skilfully lighted that it looked just like a living
woman no doubt youve heard of stella and similar
illusions

  with a mumbled commonplace of some sort broder-
ick left the room and his mind teeming with intoxi-
cating puzzling thoughts strode along the corridor

  he found eve clinging to the curtains through which
she had first stepped into his life

  anxiously she greeted him has father told you

  yes everything

  and now that you know what do you think of me
by way of answer he gathered her up in his arms
and crushed his lips to hers in a fervid suffocating
kiss that is what i think of you he panted i
love you a million times more now that i know that
you are a real woman and that every part of you is
your own dear self

  but im far from perfect

  to me you shall always be more than perfect-my
superperfect bride

are you sure you have no fault to find with me
there have been only two things about you that i
objected to one was that you were supposed to be
created in an unnatural way but that of course is re-
moved now and the other-

  yes

  you dont mind if i tell you the other was the
dominating influence which your father seems to have
over you

  father dominating me she laughed my but
thats rich why i just twirl father around my little
finger he does everything i tell him to listen i
met you once at a party years and years ago you
dont remember because i was a mere youngster and
therefore beneath your notice but i have never for-
gotten and-well-the fact of the matter is that you
were picked out not by father but by me

we fusing fool

        david h keller md

author of the psychophonic nurse the revolt of the pedestrians etc

iobert smith gave an exclamation of
 astonishment he turned to his wife and
 said

  i see that einstein has reduced all phy-
  sics to one law

  mrs smith was darning stockings at the other side
of the table the world that she was living in was a
rather new world but the stockings still had holes in
them in fact the two dollar silk stockings had as
many holes as the fifty cent lisle variety used to have
life for mrs smith was not so very interesting even
her two-year-old daughter who had most inconsider-
ately arrived in the eleventh year of an otherwise un-
eventful companionate marriage failed to provide the
blase wife with thrill though she did furnish lots of
hard work

  robert smith was an inventor that is he was a
dreamer of great innovations by night and a seller of
laces and ribbons in a large department store in the
daytime naturally such a spending of the twenty-
four hours did not provide his wife with the luxuries
of life and gradually through the years she had come
to regret the fact that her husband was just plain
robert smith instead of an edison of course when
she married him she was under the delusion that he
really would invent something which would make them
wealthy she now saw after thirteen years of grad-
ually increasing disappoint-
ment that her husband
would always remain a
salesman of ribbons and
laces

 her husband tried to
keep her interested in his
dreams that was hard to
do when she had so many
stockings to darn and but-
tons to sew on besides at
the end of the day she was
tired also her mind had
never been very much in-
terested in higher mathe-
matics or the laws of physics and all other interesting
things that her husband felt useful to him in his noc-
turnal career as an inventor frequently she did not
even have an idea of what he was talking about and his
efforts to tell her simply added to their mutual dis-
satisfaction with each other something of this kind
happened on this particular evening smith said

  i see that einstein has reduced all physics to one
law

  his wife looked up from her darning as she said
rather slowly

  i think that is a good thing we have too many
laws as it is what state does this man einstein come
from i do not recall his name but i really do not
see how all the laws could be put into one law that
must be a newspaper mistake

  einstein my dear is a german replied her hus-
band

  well of course they have to be represented still
i think that they ought to be careful in regard to elect-
ing these foreigners he may be a bolshevik

  you still do not understand this man is not a
senator he is a scientist when it says that he has
formulated a new law it means a law of physics it
has nothing to do with government

  well why didnt you say so in the first place you
said a law i guess i know what a law is and an-
other thing dont yell at me so you talk so loud
that it is no pleasure to listen to you any more if
you would spend your evenings in taking a correspond-
ence course in something instead of reading about things
nobody understands you would get away from that
ribbon and lace counter i showed you that paper
about the improvement institute a man was taking
that course and he changed from a salary of twenty
dollars a week to ten thousand a year and he only
studied ten weeks well what about this new law
it means this replied smith in a rather low
voice many centuries ago
man realized that light and
heat were related then
joule and rumford showed
that light heat and energy
are related according to
definite physical laws thus
energy was added to light
and heat now gradually
the scientists have shown
that to these three forces
can be added matter space
time gravitation and elec-
tricity the only factor
absent was to determine the
relation between electricity and gravitation according
to einstein there is only one substance the field and
this field contains electrical and gravitational compo-
nents which are closely tied together by a single for-
mula that to me said smith gravely is a most
remarkable discovery

  and to me replied his wife it does not mean a
thing

  but you do not understand just what this means
almost shouted robert smith this article says that
it means that man can fly not in a plane or a balloon

 the westinghouse laboratories have discovered a new
 magnetic alloy of wonderful properties which they call
 permalloy a sample of it properly polarised will rest in
 the air unsupported an inch or more above a magnet what
 a mass of this highly permeable alloy would do with a
 huge magnet has not yet been shown but several ideas
 suggest themselves to anyone who can visualise scientific
 possibilities or possible future inventions as to what might
 happen if this metal were combined with others or if it were
 used in a somewhat restricted form but dr keller is
 well known for the unique manner in which he makes a
 future possibility seem a thing of current occurrence the
 human interest in the story only adds to its literary value





amazing stories

but just go up in the air the thing that holds us
to the earth is gravitation if that can be overcome
why mankind can go up into space i believe i see
something in that a very simple machine which could
be produced for a few hundred dollars-

  but his wife interrupted him she was led to do
so by past experience

  a few hundred dollars would pay our expenses
for several months

  but robert smith was so absorbed that he never
heard her remark just then the baby cried in the next
room

  robert said mrs smith will you go and tend
to the baby i must finish this mending you know
it is your child as much as it is mine

  please stop calling the baby it she is too old and
besides she has a very nice name

  nevertheless he put down the paper and disappeared
into the shadows of the next room to attend to the
baby

when he returned from the care of the baby
he found that his wife had gone to bed the
sounds from their bedroom indicated that she was fast
asleep so relaxing smith started to read the article
very carefully he read that a new york professor
was making some startling statements about the new
law of einstein pie prophesied that the time would
come when airplanes would be able to remain in the
air without engines or visible support that a man
properly equipped could step out of a twenty-story
window and not be in danger of falling and that were
it not for the deadly cold of the regions beyond the
earths atmosphere a trip to the moon might be a
very easy matter this law provided a means for
insulating the body against the laws of gravitation

  that would be rather fine said smith softly to
himself that would be the real thing this air
work they are doing now is too complicated i do not
believe that it will ever be popular besides it is so
very dependent on machinery and fuel and a person
has to keep on going now my idea is to go up in
the air about fifty feet and just slowly mosey around

i feel that it would be so much more pleasant than the
way they do it now then i would want to stop if i
saw anything interesting beneath me and stay where i
was in the air till i had made a thorough examination
of the particular object my attention had been called
to you cannot do that in a plane-in one of those
things a man has to keep on moving or fall the big
thing would be to have a cheap apparatus costing a
few hundred dollars something that would go up
easily stop at any point and stay there in the air
something that would move slowly be easily guided
and in some way obtain all of its power through the
air it would have to go up like a slow elevator and
come down like a feather or a thistledown

  that would be a fine apparatus to own a man
could go on little excursions in the evening after the
wife was asleep and it would sort of take his mind
off of things there are so many things that i would
like to see from the air i bet broadway would be

an interesting sight or the statue of liberty and it
certainly would be a lark to take a piece of chalk and
write your name on the top of the washington monu-
ment of course for a long trip it would be necessary
for me to tell the wife just where i was going-but
perhaps she would have rio objections if i brought
back a nice present for her going across the ocean
would be a little dangerous but it ought to be safe to
go up the hudson after a little practice a man
could go a great distance if he had a box of lunch
with him

  it all ought to be rather easy all we need is a
starter and a stopper and of course the stopper
would be just a gradual shutting off of the starting
force then there would have to be something to
cause a progressive movement in the air something like
the propeller of an airplane and something more to
guide the thing with and there would have to be a
method of obtaining power from the air of course
there is lots of power and all kinds of electrical waves
but the question of hooking the engine on to them is
a different matter

  if i could just do that-just that simple invention-
i would be rich-perhaps rich enough to educate the
baby i believe i can do it if i can only work out a
few of the details there would have to be some kind
of a chair to sit on and something to keep the whole
machine from turning upside down that would be
most embarrassing even to be a hundred feet in the
air and have it turn over and dump you out i would
not like that to happen-at least not until i have more
insurance

the next morning he was once again a seller of
ribbons and laces but it was hard to keep his
mind on the delicate difference in the tints and colors
and the various designs of lace he sold these things
standing behind a counter to dozens of ladies stand-
ing before the counter but his soul was far away-
in the air he day-dreamed of floating up and whis-
pering in the ear of the sphinx that peculiar woman
who could live a thousand generations without betray-
ing a secret or uttering a word he thought that it
would be fine to go slowly over the top of mount
ararat and see if the ark was still there where it
had grounded in the days of noah he promised him-
self that he would spend a sunday over the battle-
field of gettysburg a place sacred to him because his
grandfather had died there

  that noon as he ate the lunch that he always brought
with him from home he feverishly read the evening
paper he was still on the trail of einstein it was
a singular coincidence that he found one of the very
facts that he was looking for it was just a simple
statement to the effect that the bell telephone labora-
tories had produced a new alloy called permalloy which
was particularly sensitive in its relation to magnetism
when a bar of it was placed above a magnet the bar
of permalloy rose in the air and floated an inch above
the magnet

  that made robert smith do a lot of thinking could
a man pull himself up in the air by lifting on his boot-
the flying fool



straps suppose there was a magnet and resting on it
was a bar of permalloy both the magnet and the bar
would be of the same size the bar is repelled by the
magnet to such a degree that it rises two inches above
it and remains suspended in the air what smith
could not make out was this problem suppose the bar
was fastened to the magnet so that it could only rise
one inch in the air but is the other inch to be
ignored there is a pull there would it go up the
extra inch if it did it would have to pull the magnet
with it as they cannot be more than an inch apart if
it kept on doing that what was there to keep it from
going on right up into the air the magnet would
be the same the permalloy would always try to with-
draw two inches from the magnet and in doing so
it would always pull the magnet upward if it did
then gravitation would be overcome and if a man was
seated on the bar he would go up with the magnet
and the bar

  of course smith realized that certain formulas
would have to be determined just how much should
the bar of permalloy weigh in proportion to the weight
of the magnet would the lifting ability of the bar
be in proportion to its weight or in relation to the
size of the magnet how long would the magnet re-
tain its magnetism could it be recharged by elec-
trical induction while it was in the air but to
smiths eager mind these were but details petty trifles
to be worked out after the larger facts had been de-
termined what he was sure of was his ability to
rise in the air provided he had a magnet and a bar
of permalloy and a chair to sit on fastened to the bar

  hastily eating his dinner he went to a public tele-
phone booth and called up the bell telephone company
had they any permalloy to sell to his surprise
they said they had and how much did he want-it was
ten dollars a pound-in the form of a very fine wire
he said that he would call them later and went back
to the ribbon and lace counter he knew that he
could secure a magnet without difficulty but how
could he manage with five pounds of wire for fifty
dollars was about all that he could spend even that
was a birthday present that he had carefully con-
cealed from his wife then the wonderful thought
came to him after long months of careful saving
on the part of his wife she had finally put aside
enough to get a new suit for him-a real tailor-made
suit there had been several trying periods of measure-
ments and fittings he would take this five pounds
of fine wire and have the tailor sew it in in some way
all through the suit then all he would need was a
chair tied to the magnet and himself tied to the chair
-and up they would go

  i may be a flying fool he whispered to himself
but it certainly will be wonderful

  it took him several days of going without his lunch
to buy the metal wire and show the puzzled tailor
just what he wanted done of course this increased
the charge for the suit but smith paid that himself out
of his personal allowance he was particular in his
instructions that under no circumstance was his wife
to be told about the wire he finally obtained a prom-

ise that the suit would be delivered in a few weeks
as a matter of fact it was delivered and hung in the
moth bag a full week before the rest of the machine
was completed

in fancy smith was now up in the air he had taken
no time at all in perfecting a simple arrangement
of wires which when a button was pressed would ex-
tract a powerful current of electricity from the at-
mosphere and this as everyone has known from the
days of benjamin franklin is constantly surcharged
with this mysterious force it was no trick at all to
get the magnet and attach to it the wires he arranged
to have the starting button at the side of his chair he
was going to press the button that would greatly in-
crease the magnetism which would repel the permalloy
in his clothes and up they would go when he wanted
to come down he would cease to pull the electricity
from the air the magnetic force would slowly wear
out and down he would come like a thistledown-he
liked the idea of coming down like a thistledown-
any other thought made him shudder

  but the question of balance bothered him suppose
he tilted and turned over where would the pull
come then certainly it would be difficult to enjoy a
ride upside down and landing on the ground head
first tied to a chair would be too ridiculous then
he thought of the gyroscope that solved everything
it would be the stabilizer nothing would be easier
than to have a gyroscope under the chair all he had
to do was to make the gyroscope the wheel of an electric
motor with finely adjusted contact mechanisms to re-
duce to a minimum the problem of friction he could
run the motor from the same electrical source that he
used to electrically induct his magnet now he was
up in the air and was going to stay right-side-up

  the securing of a small gyroscope was a problem
that almost proved to be too great for the ribbon seller
he probably never would have solved it were it not for
a friend who knowing of his problem told him of a
small private yacht that was being torn to pieces as
junk this small pleasure boat had an equally small
gyroscope to keep it from rolling at sea smith found
out what the cost was and it was possible by selling
some very special jewels left him by his father to buy
that gyroscope it was very small but it worked per-
fectly and fitted to perfection in the space under the
seat of the chair and it was almost noiseless

  now he could stay up without turning over he
could press a button and go up and another button
and slowly come down like a thistledown and all the
time the little gyroscope would keep him right side up
now all his problems were solved and all his money
gone and he still had the problem of moving through
the air it would not be very interesting to just go
up from the balcony and stay up for a while and then
come down on the balcony again though of course
that would be pleasant on a hot evening and rather a
relief at other times but he wanted to move he
wanted to go somewhere if only to coney island he
grew rather tired of seeing his wife darn stockings
-every night though it was dear of her to do so


amazing stories

  then as a last resort he conceived the idea of using
an electric fan he could attach it to the back of the
chair or he could fix it so that it would have a mov-
able point of attachment then he could go and come
and perhaps even turn around he would not go fast
-but he did not want to go fast-he just wanted to
go somewhere and see something it made no dif-
ference what it was just so he could get away from
the daily grind of laces and ribbons and ribbons and
laces and more laces and starting to work every morn-
ing and back again every night and stockings-he
was ashamed of himself but he was nervous about
those stockings and he knew that it was his fault that
they were not thrown away and new ones bought
men were wearing such fancy stockings now-a-days
but he only got stockings at christmas as presents from
his wife and from his mother

  he had an electric fan he experimented and found
to his surprise that he could run it on electricity taken
from the air in the same way that he was securing
the electric current for the motor of the gyroscope
and right there robert smith hovered on the edge of
becoming a multimillionaire had he patented that
little idea and protected the patent his wife would
have had no more need to darn stockings but all he
could think of at that time was going up in the air
he adored calling himself a flying fool it sounded so
very devilish

  naturally he could not assemble the pieces of this
apparatus without his wife having some idea that a
new invention was in process of birth but she had
lived through so many of these wonderful money-
making plans that never amounted to a hill of beans
that this latest effort of her husbands left her cold
and uninterested she simply deplored silently and
openly the fact that he was not getting more sleep as
she was sure this insomnia would result in his lowered
efficiency as a salesman of ribbons and laces and that
as she often said was really the way that they managed
to live from year to year and it was especially im-
portant now since little angelica had come to live
with them she always said it that way as though by
placing the initiative on the baby she took from her
own shoulders the burden of having made a failure of
the major factor of companionate marriage

  the smiths lived in an old-fashioned part of the
city in fact unkind friends said behind their backs
that they lived in the slums however their house
had a balcony extending back from the second story
and this balcony having no roof it was especially de-
sirable as a starting and landing place for smiths
new anti-gravitation machine two small bedrooms
opened out on this balcony by french wipdows the
fact that the bedrooms connected with each other
made it an ideal arrangement the baby slept in one
room and her parents in the other when she cried
it was very easy for the one who heard her first to look
after her-and robert smith was a light sleeper

gradually smith assembled his machine on
this balcony when he was not working at it
he kept it covered with an old canvas it just looked

like an old chair to his wife so she did not bother it
and as the weather was cold she humored him by al-
lowing him to use the electric fan in her way she
loved him but perhaps her affection would have
equaled her devotion had he been able to secure for
the family a better income however she was really
in love with him and even if life had not brought her
all she had hoped for she was inclined to be philo-
sophical about it so she left his funny old chair
alone and kept on darning the stockings and trying to
make a dollar buy two dollars worth of food

  finally the machine was completed smith sat in
the chair one night and tested the different parts
one button started the gyroscope another started the
fan while a third made the fan move slowly on its
metal track there were other buttons connected with
the magnet but they were useless so long as he did not
have on his new suit several nights after the suit
came he waited till his wife was asleep and then lov-
ingly took it out of the moth bag the tailor had been
rather skillful in sewing the wire in through the various
garments

  all was ready valuable evenings had been spent
working on the mathematics of the invention he
wanted to be sure that it was powerful enough to
carry his weight and also the weight of the entire
machine even while he was working the singular
thought came to him that all his calculations were
unnecessary because if the permalloy was repelled by
the magnet it had to take with it anything that it was
attached to right here the idea came to him of a
small circular track with a block of permalloy on
wheels constantly retreating from a magnet on wheels
the very idea of it-the constant revolutions-why
it was almost perpetual motion-made him so dizzy
that he nearly fell out of his chair and his wife in-
sisted on his taking a dose of calomel

  at the end of his calculations he was satisfied that
nothing had been neglected it was just a question
of putting on that new suit strapping himself to the
chair and pressing a few buttons he decided to
wait till the moon was full and that would be just one
more night then when he was sure that his wife was
asleep he would dress and soar in a peculiar way
that was hard for him to understand this first ad-
venture in the air meant freedom to him and yet he did
not comprehend just what it was that he wanted re-
lease from

  all that he was afraid of was that it would rain
of course he knew that he could carry an umbrella
but that seemed somehow to be hardly suitable

  when the next evening came he found that all of
his fears had been useless it was not only clear it
was a wonderful night a strong wind had cleared
the atmosphere it was warm there was hardly a
breath stirring at ten oclock and the moonlight was
so strong that it was almost possible to see the print
on a newspaper

  mrs smith unconsciously helped her husband in
his plans by going to bed early in fact she was
sound asleep by nine the baby had been asleep
for several hourssmith tiptoed into their bedroom
the flying fool



took the new suit moth bag and all and tiptoed into
the babys room there he rapidly and as quietly as
he could changed suits he was glad to see how well
the coat and vest fitted him on his way to the bal-
cony he had to pass the little crib he paused a mo-
ment even touched the little girls hand she had
always been a wonder to him-he never fully under-
stood just how it was that she had come into his
life-but at night as she slept she was almost a
miracle for a long minute he hung over the crib to
satisfy himself that she was breathing and the love
that passed between them in some way recalled another
love and he thought of his wife of what had been of
their early hopes and ambitions and how gradually
one by one those hopes had slowly been blasted and
now at the age of nearly fifty he was still a salesman
of ribbons and laces he quietly walked to her bed-
side-she was still a pretty woman-and he realized
as never before just what she had meant to him and
what she had done for him and sacrificed for him in
all those years of their married life and in addition
she had somehow found that little new love of his
the charming dresden china baby angelica

  he bent over and kissed her hair and then sighing
passed through the door out on the gallery where
his soaring invention awaited him he sat down in the
chair and started to fasten the straps everything was
all ready to press the starting button-

  and the baby cried

smith sat still perhaps she would go to sleep but
she cried again

  a womans clear voice came to his straining ears
robert can you take care of the baby she has
cried twice now and i am sure that she needs atten-
tion i am s sleepy and i know you are still dressed
i will attend to her as soon as i can smith re-
plied he unstrapped himself and went into the nur-
sery sure enough angelica needed help with skill-
ful loving hands he quietly cared for her talking lit-
tle nonsense verses to her as he did so in the hope that
she would not become wide-awake but she did when
he left her crib her little whimperings told him that
she wanted him she even sat up in bed and the next
moment was standing up ready to play

  he tried to persuade her to lie down he told her
that papa was building a flying machine and if she
was a good girl he would let her ride in it like a bird
some day he had made this promise to her before
and it had always put her to sleep but this time it
only seemed to make her more excited

  angie fly birdie she insisted

  sighing robert smith took his daughter out of the
crib and then the wonderful thought came to him
that it would be a fine thing to take her with him he
could hold her in one arm and manage all the buttons
with the other hand it was a pleasant night warm
and he would not go far perhaps simply go up in the
air for a while and then come right back down again
he carried angelica out on the balcony and reseated
himself in the chair it was a little hard to strap him-

the

 self in but he finally did so and he even found enough
 strap left over to put around the baby

   she enjoyed it all

   angelica whispered the gray-haired man your
father is a flying fool and so is his little baby
angie fly birdie cooed the little one

   robert smith shut his eyes at last he had come to
the parting of the ways here was freedom and
adventure and perhaps romance and he was sure that
with the baby in his arms the romance would be of
the purest variety his heart began to beat faster he
held the baby so tight that she began to whimper-and
then he pressed the starter button

   and waited

   nothing happened-not a thing was different-sick-
ened with disappointment he realized that nothing was
going to happen somewhere there had been a mistake

   as he sat there the little girl went to sleep tired
 of waiting anaesthetized by the fresh air perhaps a
 little cold she had cuddled close to her father and gone
 to sleep almost as in a dream robert smith un-
 strapped himself and carried his sleeping daughter to
 her crib she simply relaxed and kept on sleeping
 then smith undressed-he put his new suit back in
 the moth bag and hung it up-and then he prepared for
 bed somehow his wife awoke it was a rather
 unusual thing for her to do this and smith did not
 understand it till she started to talk to him

   you know robert a most unusual thing happened
this week and i have been trying to find time and the
right occasion to tell you about it you know how i
have planned and saved for that new suit and how
proud i was to think that at last you were going to
have one tailor-made instead of a hand-me-down well
when that suit came i examined it very carefully and
it had the most peculiar wire threaded through it long
pieces i worked and worked at it and finally got it
all out and i took it to a dealer in old metals and he
said he would give a dollar a pound for it and it
weighed just five pounds so there i had five dollars
and i spent it for stockings for you i bought you
six pairs and they are guaranteed to be hole-proof
you needed some new stockings i have tried to dam
them as carefully as i could but i really dont see how
you could wear them being on your feet the way you
are all day now how can you explain that wire in
that new suit i called up the tailor and i believe he
was puzzled himself at least he acted so

   it certainly is odd answered her husband but
i am glad you bought me the new stockings you sew
too much did you buy me striped or colored ones
no i thought for your ribbon and lace work it
would be better to have black ones do you know i
am wide-awake  i want to talk i was reading today
about a mans claiming that some day men would float
through the air what do you think of that

  i think that any man who wanted to do a thing
like that would be a flying fool said robert jones
slowly then he forced himself to go to sleep for
the next day he would be busy selling ribbons and
laces

by captain spmeek usa

author of the murgatroyd experiment

enneth there is a legal-looking letter
here for you said rose as i entered the
bungalow

  i knew that we had a states mail to-
day i replied as i took the letter from
her and sank into an easy chair this is probably a
business letter delivered here by mistake

  its marked personal  she objected

  i tore open the envelope and glanced at the letter
  great scott i exclaimed as i sat bolt upright

  rose hastened to my side and read the letter over my
shoulder it contained the news that thomas wallace
of new york had died on december th as a result of
injuries sustained in an automobile accident it also
stated that his will had been examined and that i had
been named sole heir to his estate

  sole heir exclaimed rose was he worth much
  about twenty millions i replied

  rose gasped at the immensity of the sum

  heavens she exclaimed were rich who was
he kenneth

  he was a living example of the futility of human
wisdom i said slowly he was a man who was
cursed with too much knowledge and one who fought
unavailingly against fate and waged a battle that he
knew from the start was a losing one

  nine months before when the berengaria docked
at new york i was one of the first men down the
gangplank i had not set foot on the soil of my native
land for nearly fourteen
years and i was anxious to
see how the atmosphere of
the busiest city in the world
would affect nerves attuned
for nearly a decade and a
half to peruvian mining
camps on the dock i
looked eagerly around for
the friend who had prom-
ised to meet me i saw
nothing that resembled the
trim athletic figure i was 
expecting and i started for

the far end of the customs shed when a hand fell on
my shoulder and a tired listless voice sounded in my
ear

  you havent changed a great deal ken it said

  i whirled around my hand outstretched to greet the
owner of the welcoming voice but i paused in the act
of greeting him the alert vigorous figure that i had
expected was not there and it took an effort for me to
recognize my friend in the carelessly dressed individual
who stood before me it was to be expected that four-
teen years would take some of the bloom of youth

 tjfe read perpetually of plotting curves for instance
 by obtaining the necessary data and information the
 time of future tides can be predicted with exactitude certain
 machines are now in use that can solve all kinds of seem-
 ingly unsolvable mathematical problems in a very short space
 of time it seems to us quite possible that some day some
 scientist and mathematician might attain the apparently im-
 possible and learn to plot curves for human beings which
 will result in true prophecies how desirable such an inven-
 tion might be is another matter much philosophising might
 be done on that score certainly the author furnishes food
 for thought

from a man but tom wallace had aged forty years in
that length of time it was not the droop of his
shoulders or the lines in his face that impressed me
it was the expression that he wore his was the face
of a man who had acquired all knowledge and had tasted
all pleasure and had found that wisdom was vanity and
that the taste of pleasure was the taste of wormwood
and ashes his face was lined with sorrow and grief
but i have seen faces so marked that still radiated life
and hope and faith in the future i could not place his
expression for a moment and then it dawned on me
where i had seen a similar one it was the same ex-
pression that i had seen shortly before his execution on
the face of a criminal condemned to die it was a face
devoid of hope

  with an effort i dissembled my surprise and greeted
him heartily he shook my hand in the same tired
listless way in which he had spoken and asked about
my luggage evidently he was a man of some promi-
nence for a word from him was enough to secure a
customs inspector promptly and to pass me through in
short order he led the way to a luxurious town car
which waited for us and we rolled off toward his
home

  you havent changed a great  deal ken he re-
peated

  i hesitated for a moment over my reply

  you havent changed as much as you might have
yourself i said rather tactfully as i thought

  you used to be more
truthful than that he re-
plied you might as well
get used to saying what you
think to me it wont hurt
my feelings at all im be-
yond that sort of thing
how has the world treated
you since i saw you last
i cant complain i have
a good position and have
done some good work i

 	- 	am up here now to act as

                           adviser on a projected con-
solidation of our properties with those owned by our
leading competitor if the deal goes through we will
almost control the copper situation in peru how have
you made out

  ill-or well depending on your viewpoint i
consider it ill

  i heard in a roundabout way that you had made
money

  oh-money he waved his hand contemptuously
as if the thought of mere money made him disgusted
yes i have made money-more money than i know


   what i have described is the machine in its simplest operation of adding a series of simultaneous curves    one great
   improvement that we made was that we eliminated the need for an operator for each curve one man could do the whole job



      


amazing stories

what co do with i have been very successful that way
  is your health good

  i havent been sick a day in the last four years
  has your work gone satisfactorily

  if you refer to the successful completion of the
problem i have spent my life on it has gone very
satisfactorily i have completed it

  if you have made good in your work and have good
health and have incidentally made more money than
you know what to do with what in sam hill is the
matter with you i demanded warmly

  i have no future no hope nothing to look forward
to he answered tonelessly

  no future my aunt i exclaimed why tom
you are still young and have many years to look for-
ward to think what you can do

  i have just eight months and four days he said
drily

  i thought you told me that your health was good 
i asked in surprise

  it is as good as any one could ask for

  yet you tell me that you have less than a year to
live i remonstrated that is hot air if i may speak
frankly even the best doctors and of course you have
the best are sometimes mistaken

  i have no doctor i will die in an automobile acci-
dent

  i looked at him sharply there were no signs of in-
sanity visible to my unpractised eye but his words made
me doubtful i had read of cases of monomania of
this type indeed i had encountered a case in a native
in peru and i had doubts of wallaces sanity

  im not insane he said answering my unspoken
question i simply know do you remember bob
jerningham 

  i nodded

  he is the man who is responsible for my knowl-
edge he said however we wont talk of it now
when we get him ill tell you about it i am really very
glad to see you in fact i think that i would have
sent for you if your letter hadnt come telling me that
you were on your way sit quietly now and recall all
that you can about bob it will save me some time and
trouble in explaining if you can recollect him fairly
well

  i respected his wishes and sat in silence for the rest
of the drive trying to recall what i could about bob
j erningham

tom wallace and i had been friends after a
fashion in college we were fraternity brothers
and had lived in the same house for several years and
that accounted for our semi-intimacy which is all that
it really amounted to he had a flair for mathematics
especially of the abstruse and philosophical type while
my energies had been devoted to the more concrete and
practical studies of the course in mining engineering
that i was pursuing my only really close association
with tom had come in my senior year he had wor-
shipped at the shrine of a local goddess who heeded only
the offerings of athletes and he had come to me asking
for aid in developing athletic ability

  his frame was too light to offer much hope for suc-
cess in football and besides i was captain of the track
team that year so i persuaded him to come out for
distance running he had a little latent ability and a
dogged perseverance and a willingness to heed coaching
all of which enabled me to make a fair two-miler out
of him he won his letter just before my graduation
and he swore eternal gratitude his being in a way
a protege of mine probably accounted for the desul-
tory correspondence we had carried on ever since
our letters were never long but at least each knew
where the other was and when i came to return to the
united states he was the only one of my old friends
whom i could locate fourteen years in south america
will get a man pretty well out of touch with his friends
in the states

  i could recall bob jerningham faintly but little more
than the name and a few facts remained in my memory
bob had been a graduate student during three of my
four years in college and he had not lived at the
fraternity house he had some kind of a research fel-
lowship in mathematics and had spent his time mooning
around the mathematical library and the astronomi-
cal observatory and had only shown up at the house
for supper about once a month when he did so his
head was so far in the clouds that he showed little or
no interest in our mundane affairs i remembered that
he and tom had been rather close friends their inti-
macy being no doubt due to their kindred interest in
mathematics although jerningham as i remembered
him went in for the practical end a little more than
wallace did

  the ride ended before an apartment building on
park avenue and i followed tom through the foyer
and up to his rooms i gasped a little at the mag-
nificence of the furnishings as i entered it was evi-
dent that he had indeed made more money than he
knew what to do with

  now i am ready to talk he said as the valet took
our hats and coats and disappeared with them what
do you remember about jerningham

  i told him the little that i had managed to recall
and he sat in silence for a few moments

  that little wont help much he said ill have
to tell you the whole thing however theres no hurry
and i presume you would like to tell me about your
mine fire away i have over eight months and you
dont look as if you were to die soon

  you are getting on my nerves tom wallace i
said rather sharply you talk as if you knew just
when you were to die and how you dont know any
such thing and its rather ridiculous to let your mind
brood on any such obsession

  he smiled faintly

  i will die at exactly seven minutes four and two-
fifths seconds after eleven oclock on the morning of
december th  in a private room in the belle-
vue hospital he said i will be injured in an auto-
mobile crash at twenty-two minutes fourteen and one-
fifth seconds after nine oclock the evening before both
legs will be broken and my spine will be injured so
badly that my recovery will be patently impossible i
futility



will not lose consciousness but will suffer the agonies
of the damned from the time of the accident until death
literally comes to my relief

  i snorted in simulated disgust but inwardly i was
shaken such positiveness as to the time and place of
the accident and such a wealth of detail as to the in-
juries was uncanny furthermore there was a ring of
absolute conviction in his voice

  have you become an oracle of delphi able to fore-
tell the future i asked with attempted sarcasm

  i can foretell the future he said simply

  how do you do it i asked this time my sar-
casm was real do you use crystal gazing palmistry
or playing cards or do you use the simpler method
of tea-leaves in a cup

  he smiled again

  i am neither crazy nor the victim of superstition
he replied i hold no more faith in magic than you
do but at the same time i tell you calmly and dis-
passionately that i can foretell the future

  i laughed it was an impolite thing to do but i
couldnt help it the whole thing was too absurd my
host however took no offense

  your laughter is simply an exhibition of ignorance
he said tonelessly the whole thing is purely a matter
of applied mathematics jerningham and i worked it
out or rather he worked it out with a little aid from
me on some of the principles of pure mathematics
how did you think that i made my money

  i professed my ignorance of his modus opcrandi and
he went on

  i made it in the stock market since i was able to
predict with mathematical accuracy the movements of
any stock all i needed was a shoestring to start on
i ran my original capital of less than a thousand dollars
up to twenty millions with only one single loss that
was caused by my carelessness in making a computa-
tion

was properly impressed by his statement no
matter how he did it any man who was able to per-
form the feat that he had named was entitled to re-
spect

  can you predict other things i asked

  i can predict anything for which i have or can
gather the necessary data he replied

  can you tell me when i am to die i asked

  he started as though i had struck him

  i can he answered but i am not cruel enough to
do so unless i am sure that you realize just what you
are asking

  why cruel i asked i really would like to
know it wouldnt worry me at all to have that infor-
mation we all have to die some time and i think that
it would be an advantage to know just when

  that is the folly of ignorance he said bitterly
i dont blame you though i thought the same thing
mvself once stop to consider what you are asking for
a moment i will admit that we know that we all have
to die some time but we dont realize it each person
looks forward with equanimity to the time when his
friends or even his loved ones will die but he cant re-

alize the fact of his own rapidly approaching death
death to each of us seems a thing apart from our-
selves we dont say so even in our own minds but
each in his innermost consciousness fancies himself
immortal and doesnt realize that the death which he
knows is inevitable for others is also inevitable for
himself it is this thought or rather this internal con-
viction of immortality that keeps us going think now
if you knew that you were to die in nine days what in-
terest would you have in life what could you do in
nine days

  i dont expect to die in nine days i replied

  you prove my point he went on thousands of
people are going to die in the next nine days why
shouldnt you be one of them  there is no reason why
you shouldnt yet you refuse to even consider the pos-
sibility your answer is the same that would be given
by every one of the thousands who are going to die
even those who are on the bed of a fatal sickness

  if i had your ability to foretell the future id live
forever i retorted for instance you are going to
die in bellevue hospital the morning of december th
if i were in your shoes instead of waiting here like a
sheep for the slaughter id be in china on december
th

  i dont say that i shall die in bellevue hospital
if i ivcrc there he said i said that i shall die there
i have checked my figures and calculations a hundred
times and there is no error in them it is the truth
and there is no way to evade fate as jerningham found
out

  the whole proposition is a palpable absurdity i
exclaimed a prediction of the future can be at best
only a shrewd guess an accurate prediction such as
you pretend to have made is an impossibility

  it is impossible for you to take a white rabbit out
of a silk hat he answered but any third-rate magi-
cian can do it it is impossible to hear music played
a thousand miles away when there is no material con-
nection yet every schoolboy with his home-made radio
set accomplishes the feat daily the discovery that
bob and i made is merely a slight advance a very
slight advance over commonplace everyday mathemati-
cal and mechanical knowledge and is a discovery that
may be duplicated by any man with jerninghams brain
if no such man arises the problem will be solved by a
series of minute steps slowly and painstakingly made
by men of less mentality the development may take
several hundred years but it will come sooner or later
two of the important steps in the process have already
been made and are in daily use however i expect
that i had better go back to the beginning and trace
the whole development for you

  he leaned back and lighted a cigar and studied the
smoke thoughtfully

  during your last year in college bob jerningham
and i were pretty close friends he began but it was
not until the next year that we became really intimate
i was doing some rather advanced work on transcen-
dental functions and that brought us into contact for
some of his work tied in with mine rather closely
the longer and more intimately i knew him the more


amazing stories

i appreciated the quality of his mind he was easily
the most brilliant man of this generation einstein
is a schoolboy compared to what jerningham was in
addition to his immense mathematical ability he had a
practical ability in a mechanical line that was little
short of genius

  we became more intimate as the year wore on and
when i graduated he insisted that i stay at the uni-
versity for at least two more years and do research
work in mathematics in some problems in pure mathe-
matics that he wanted worked out i had about ex-
hausted my funds but jerningham seemed to have
plenty of money and he offered to stake me to all ex-
penses and pay me a pretty good salary if i would work
on his problems he was good enough to say that he
thought that my ability would make me worth what it
cost him in short i stayed

  i didnt learn a great deal about the particular prob-
lem that he was working on but some of the things he
gave me to work out were cautions he would bring
in a mass of data that he wanted collated and cata-
logued and curves plotted and calculated from usually
in polar coordinates and would leave it to me to
wrestle with sometimes it would take me three months
to get the curve that he wanted when i had it com-
pleted he would check it over in a few minutes and
would sometimes put his finger on an error that would
require a month of careful checking and recalculating
to rectify

  i put in two years at this sort of mathematical
hack work before he saw fit to confide to me the object
of his investigations it was nothing less than an in-
strument that would enable him to calculate and predict
future events

  such an idea would have been enough to show me
that he was as crazy as a coot i interrupted

  yes said wallace drily well it didnt show me
any such a thing it showed me merely the greatness
and genius of the man why are you so sure that
future events cannot be calculated

  principally because it has never been done

  it has been done a great many times have you
never heard of the predicting of eclipses

  eclipses are simple to predict i retorted all
that is necessary is to calculate the movements of cer-
tain bodies that follow definite and well-known laws
besides they arent done by a machine

lj verything follows definite laws although
jl many of them are not well-known he replied
and the only reason why eclipses are not predicted
by machine is because there are so few of them that
it would be uneconomical to make a robot to do the
work as far as mechanical calculating is concerned
you are of course perfectly familiar with adding
machines and other forms of mechanical calculators
why even as long ago as when you were in college a
vastly more complicated machine than an eclipse pre-
dictor would be was known and in common use i
refer to the harmonic analyzer

  that is entirely different i protested the har-
monic analyzer doesnt predict anything it merely takes

a complex curve and breaks it up into a lot of simple
harmonic curves which combined together will make
the original curve which was fed into it

  yet it is a robot that works on the reverse of the
principles of jerninghams predictograph he answered
you realize of course that when it is possible to
make a machine that will analyze or break into its com-
ponent parts a complex curve it should be and in fact
is easy to construct a machine that will reverse the
process and take a number of simple curves and com-
bine them into one complex curve such a machine
jerningham made it is on this principle that the tide
predictor in the hydrographic office at washington
is built

  what machine is that i asked

  it is a robot that will accurately and positively pre-
dict the tides on any given date in any port in the
world twenty years in advance he replied that
happens to be a relatively simple matter there are
only a few variables entering into tidal movements
and their laws of variation are well known it was
very easy for jerningham to make a machine which
would take the curves representing the rate of change
of these variables and combine them into a curve that
would give the time and height of the tide in any port
for which the data was supplied to it there is no
mystery about that machine it is being used daily
that is news to me i said

  a machine of that type was the first and simplest
machine which he constructed wallace went on his
next one was on a little different mechanical principle
and somewhat resembling the one announced recently
by the massachusetts institute of technology you
probably read about that the papers were full of it
i read something about it but i dont profess to
understand it i replied

  it is a splendid mechanical job he said but the
principle is not hard to grasp it consists of a number
of variable speed electric motors whose speed is con-
trolled by arms attached to them ending in pointers
by moving a pointer attached to the control arm of
the motor along a curve plotted out to scale the speed
of the motor is made to vary according to the value of
the ordinates of the curve if you have an operator
to each curve you are using each operator can vary
the speed of one of the motors according to the
ordinates of the curve before him thus you will have
a number of motors each running with a speed pro-
portionate to the value of the ordinates of a different
curve it is necessary to synchronize the movements
of the operators so that the abscissa value of each
curve will be the same at any given moment do you
understand 

  that much seems simple enough i admitted
each of these motors has its separate influence on
a central pointer which is extended or retracted ac-
cording to the combined speed of all of the individual
motors and which as it moves along a sheet of paper
at the same abscissa speed as is being used on the pri-
mary curves plots a curve which is the resultant of the
primary curves what i have described is the machine
in its simplest operation of adding a series of simul-
futility



taneous curves by making slight modifications one
or more of the curves can be subtracted while the
others are being added or by further complications one
of the curves may be made to multiply or divide the
others which may in turn be adding subtracting mul-
tiplying or dividing one another according to the way
the robot is set am i making myself clear

  i begin to have some idea of it i replied it
sounds practicable

  practicable its in daily operation he said that
was only the second step in jerninghams program he
had got that far by the end of my second graduate year
and it was then that he suggested that we leave the
university where we were rather restricted in our
work and come here to new york where we could be
more independent i was interested by this time and
as he offered me the same terms that he had offered
me at college-that is my expenses and a fair salary
-i came with him we established ourselves with our
apparatus in a building which he rented and went ahead
with our experiments

  by the end of another year we had constructed
a machine that would handle a hundred separate var-
iables at one time performing any operations with any
curve that we wished one great improvement that we
made was that we eliminated the need for an operator
for each curve one man could do the whole job in
addition to adding subtracting multiplying and divid-
ing the robot would extract any desired root or raise to
any desired power or would apply any natural or
transcendental function to them that was the part
that i worked out

  we got the machine ready and tried it out it
worked perfectly and then jerningham announced that
we would have to quit he had run out of money

that news was rather a body blow to me for

  x i had become as enthusiastic about the machine
as he was i had a little money saved from the salary
which he had paid me and i put this at his service
but it was too little to make a great amount of differ-
ence while we were arguing about what we would do
i received word that an uncle of mine had died and
had left me about twelve thousand dollars and i wanted
to hand that over to bob he refused to take it at first
for he knew that it was all that i had and he could
see no immediate commercial value to his machine
then it was that i got my great idea which cursed
both our lives

  i suggested that we put our robot to a practical use
since we were both convinced by this time that every-
thing happened according to natural laws as the product
of certain variables i suggested that we cease work on
the machine itself and devote our time to determining
some of the rates of change of variables that we could
turn to monetary profit the stock market suggested
itself as a logical starting place

  it took us two years to collect the data and plot
the curves representing the eighty-three variables that
we found affected the market on two active stocks
which we selected for our first venture when we had
the data in usable shape we ran it through the pre-

dictograph and obtained a curve which was supposed to
show the variations in the price of these stocks for
the next year one of them was not so very active
so we let it go and concentrated our attention on the
other one we werent quite broke so we devoted the
next three months to minor refinements in our calcu-
lations meanwhile watching the ticker and checking
up on our curve it proved to be absolutely accurate
and we were ready to start our financial operations
there is one thing that i dont understand i
broke in i can easily understand how you could cal-
culate the price which your stock ought to sell at
from your data but i dont see how you managed to
take account of the actions of the buyers and sellers
in other words it seems to me that you have left
human nature out of your calculations

  we didnt leave it out it was one of the eighty-
three variables that we considered while at that
time we were unable to predict with any probability of
accuracy the actions of any given individual we had
found that it was easy to predict with absolute cer-
tainty the actions of ninety-nine per cent of humanity
and that was enough to work on the remaining one
per cent didnt affect the market enough to vitiate our
curve ill describe later some of the troubles we en-
countered when we attacked the problem of the lone
individual but to get on with my story

  by the time that we were ready to start speculating
although with our knowledge it wasnt really a specu-
lation we had less than a thousand dollars left we
talked the matter over and decided to make a lot right
away or go broke so we dug up a broker who would
let us stretch our margin out pretty thin and we piled
our whole lot on our chosen stock and sat back and
waited for things to happen they happened all right
exactly as our curve predicted and we made money fast
as the stock rose we pyramided when it was due for
a small setback we would sell enough to get our margin
on a firm basis and ride the depression out when a
big retrogession was due we would sell out and then
sell short and whipsaw the market going and coming
we kept this up for several months and then took our
profits which amounted to about two hundred thousand
dollars and went back to our work

  we didnt want ever to be financially embarrassed
again so our first task was to determine and calculate
the variable on a bunch of selected stocks which would
give us wider latitude for our operations we dis-
carded the less active ones but we accumulated data
on thirty and went back to the market it was a sure
thing we cleaned up over twenty millions and then
quit for good one thing happened that alarmed us
for a short time twenty-nine of our stocks behaved
according to specifications but one didnt however
when we checked back we ascertained the cause it
was due to my carelessness in misplacing a decimal in
calculating one of the primary curves and not to any
fault of the machine

  didnt the war interfere with your work

  no we tried to enlist in the army early in the
game but they wouldnt have either of us bob had
poor eyesight and i turned out to have flat feet so


amazing stories

we were both exempted we tried for a while to fit
into other work than fighting but there were a dozen
applicants for every white collar job and we couldnt
see where it would help materially to win the war if
we put on overalls and kept a good mechanic out of a
job so we stuck at our work

  the war turned every ones thoughts toward the
uncertainty of human life and bob conceived the idea
of determining the variables that went to make up a
humans life span that was where we ran into the
variable of human nature in the individual but bob
finally solved the problem i wont bother to go into
details but by testing the reaction to certain definite
stimuli the temperament of an individual can be de-
termined with great exactness it was not an easy
problem and it took eight years of research and calcu-
lation and we made a good many errors at first but
in the end we were able to classify people on the basis
of a series of temperamental index readings as we
called them

  how many variables did you find i asked

  nine hundred and thirty-four he replied

  it must have taken some machine to handle them
all at once i exclaimed

  the machine would have covered an acre of ground
if we had been forced to combine them all in one
calculation he said but as it happened we didnt
have to we found that they were divided up into
groups which interacted upon and affected one another
the number in a group ran from twelve to ninety-one
and there were twenty-two groups our method was to
obtain a resultant curve for each group and then a
grand resultant from the twenty-two when the final
curve ran to zero we believed that it represented the
end of the life span of the individual

t rhen we had perfected our method as we

  vv thought we had to find some way of testing
the accuracy of it there was a murder trial going on
in the state at the time and we obtained permission
from the governor to make some tests on the accused
they thought we were trying to establish his sanity
and we let the authorities think so but we were really
trying to tell when he would die when we got the
curve finished it showed his early death we watched
the trial pretty closely and when he was acquitted we
felt pretty sick however less than two weeks later
he was shot to death presumably by some gangster
and as near as we could determine we had hit the time
of his death to the fraction of a second

  that encouraged us but we wanted more cases
we obtained them through the courtesy of a hospital
who allowed us to take readings on certain of their
patients with the patients consent of course we
made twenty calculations and in every case where our
prediction showed an early death it happened on
scheduled time two of our test cases are living yet
and according to our curves have a good many years of
life ahead of them

  now i must digress a little in order that you may
understand the rest of the story

  when we first came to new york we had acquired

along with the rest of our office furnishings a stenog-
rapher i dont remember her name but it doesnt
matter for she left soon and another took her place
we changed a number of times usually getting a worse
one than the one we lost but the worst that wre ever
got was the one we took on just before we had com-
pleted our string of calculations her name was mabel
thompson and she was as good looking as home made
sin but that is all i can say for her i took her out to
supper a couple of times but as soon as i found that
she had blond hair inside her skull instead of brains
the blond hair on the outside of it lost its attractiveness
and i dropped her i had to anyway the competition
was too hot

  i suppose that it was the attraction of opposites
that was the cause for she was just as brainless as
bob was brainy whatever the reason he fell hard
and while i dont think she cared for him particularly
she had a bad case on his bank roll and she hooked
him nicely bob began to think about her instead
of his work and i urged him to go ahead and marry her
i figured that a month of mabel would cure him and
she could get the divorce and alimony that i was sure
figured in her plans and bob could get to work with a
clear head again

  they became engaged all right and she promptly
planned a year-long trip around the world for a honey-
moon that rather worried bob for he had conceived
a greater idea than any he had had before and he
didnt relish losing a year even for mabel she was
anxious to marry him and start spending his roll but
she was foxy enough to pretend great and absorbing
interest in bis work and she hung around the office all
the time-in order to keep an eye on her successor i
fancied

  i thought you said that she was working for you
i remarked

  she was but when she and bob became engaged i
suggested that it would be a good idea to discharge her
with two years salary in order to let her get ready
for the wedding bob agreed and we got a girl who
didnt spell principle with an al

  she was more or less in the way in the laboratory
and to quiet her and keep her away from bob i took
a lot of temperamental index readings on her and
gathered other data that would enable me to predict her
life span although at that time i had no idea of
doing it

  the great idea that bob was working on wras a
method of calculating not only the time but also the
place and manner of an individuals death that intro-
duced a lot of extra complications and variables and for
a while threatened to stump us but bob had made up
his mind to postpone his wedding until he solved the
problem and he worked like a demon and drove me as
if i were a slave his genius became even more
scintillating under the stimulus of his affair with mabel
and he solved the problem one day he made the final
calculation and we looked on a system of curves that
would enable us given the data to predict not only the
time but also the place and manner of the death of any
individual on whom we could secure sufficient facts of
futility



course it wasnt confined to the death of a person al-
though that was the most important event by supply-
ing data we could predict any event that would happen

  for some time we checked our method by experi-
menting on one another in minor affairs for instance
bob would determine what color tie i would wear the
next day or i would predict what he would have for
dinner the next night and little things like that when
the event had happened we would compare notes and we
never found ourselves in an error

utt then we had checked our method to our satis-

  w faction on one momentous day we assembled
all of the needed data and ran a determination of my
future life and the time and circumstances of my death
it was on that day that i found when and where i
would go west it was something of a shock to see
my death predicted so soon but i thought of the same
thing that you suggested namely that on the day i
was due to die in new york i would be in china or
somewhere else it really didnt worry me much at
first

  after we had finished calculating my demise we
ran a curve on bob and then we got a real shock
bob was due to die in just thirty-nine days he was
to die in a railroad accident near lima ohio he
looked at me with a funny expression when he read
the curve and the same idea that had struck me struck
him

   when that time comes ill be a good many miles
from ohio he said with a laugh

  i agreed with him as to the wisdom of that and we
began to make plans we decided that the best bet
for him would be to take a train for san francisco
the next evening and sail from there to hawaii as he
pointed out he could get to san francisco in four days
and he would be safe in honolulu long before the
day came when he was due to die in ohio we both
laughed at the way in which we were going to cheat
fate

  when we had perfected the plans it struck bob
that it would be a fine idea to marry mabel the next
morning and start his honeymoon it sounded all
right but i suggested that we run through the data
that i had gathered on her and see how her curve
looked he agreed and we assembled the data plotted
our curves and ran a resultant it showed that mabel
had only seventeen days to live and that she would die
of poisoning in honolulu

  we both of us looked rather funny when we saw
that

   apparently that idea wont work said bob with a
sickly grin if i stay around here something is liable
to take me to ohio and if i go to hawaii and take mabel
with me i am sealing her death warrant

   the best thing for you to do i told him is to
write mabel a letter and tell her what you have learned
and warn her not to leave new york for a while
in the meantime you go to hawaii where you are
safe mabel can join you as soon as her seventeen
days are up in fact she can start from here in ten days
if she wants to and you can be married there after

your honeymoon you can come back and we can go on
with our work meanwhile ill keep things moving
to the best of my ability

  bob agreed with my plan and so far as i knew he
carried it out he gave me a letter to mail to mabel
and he took the flyer the next night for chicago on his
way west i mailed the letter after seeing him off and
went back to work expecting that the next word that i
received from bob would be that he had sailed you
can imagine my astonishment when i received late
the next night a wire from chicago telling that bob
was in the presbyterian hospital there the wire said
that he was unconscious but he had been recognized
by papers in his pockets and the papers indicated that
i was the logical one to be notified

  i went to the telephone and called mabel for i
thought that she ought to know about it and i was sure
that she would want to go to chicago with me mabel
had gone i asked where and when i was told i nearly
fainted she had left on the flyer that evening for
chicago cn route to honolulu i couldnt get any
satisfaction out of her landlady except that her boy
friend had sent her a ticket and told her to come i
began to wonder if we were really as smart as we
thought we were about beating fate i called up the
airport and was lucky enough to get a place on the
mailplane to chicago the next day

  when i got there i found that bob was still un-
conscious he had had a four-hour lay-over in chi-
cago and he had apparently taken a taxi in order to
kill time the taxi had been smashed up at the corner
of madison and state streets and bob had been rushed
to the hospital unconscious and had remained so

  there was nothing that i could do for him and i
did just that all that i could do was to look up hon-
olulu boats and figure out which one mabel would
take i thought she would take the first one so i
wired her in care of it and told her what had happened
to bob and told her to read his last letter and be guided
by the advice he had given her in it about staying in
new york for a while later on i would have given
a good deal to have recalled that wire

  in due time i received an answer from her mabel
proved herself to be just as dumb as i thought she
was she wired back something to the effect that she
knew that i would like to break up her match with
bob but that she knew that bob was in honolulu and
that she was going there and that she wasnt fooled at
all by my wire i saw then that there was no use in
trying to stop her especially as she had waited and sent
the wire just before the boat was due to sail

dob didnt recover consciousness for a week and

  d when he did he was too weak to stand a shock so
i didnt tell about mabel he asked for her but i told
him that i had thought it better not to alarm her and
i allowed him to think that she was safe in new york

  he gained strength very slowly as the day for
mabels death approached he got pretty nervous but
when the day passed off without anything happening he
looked relieved and the next day he was quite cheerful
again


amazing stories

   i guess we cheated fate all right tom he said
there is really no reason why mabel shouldnt come to
chicago and id like to see her wire her to come
wont you

  i stalled him off and he appeared satisfied it never
occurred to me to censor or even look at the daily paper
before he saw it and as it happened there wasnt a
thing in the one i saw the nurse brought him a dif-
ferent one and there on the front page was a head-
lined account of mabels death she had talked a good
deal on the voyage and the reporters had got hold of
the romantic angle of the affair and her death by
ptomaine poisoning was news therefore the hour and
minute of her death corresponded exactly with the time
we had predicted when allowance was made for the
difference in time between honolulu and new york

  the shock threw bob into a relapse and he was
unconscious for another two days when he recovered
his senses the police were after him

  the police i asked in astonishment

  they were indeed said tom the honolulu
police investigated her death and looked through her
effects and among other things they found bobs letter
telling her that she would die of poisoning on that
date unless she obeyed his instructions he hadnt told
her where she was to die but he told her that he was
leaving for honolulu and told her to follow him in ten
days after he left he had enclosed a check for her
expenses whether the girl misunderstood him or
whether she paid no attention to the part of the letter
telling her when to come no one will ever know but
the facts were that she had hustled off to honolulu on
the fastest trains and boats that she could connect
with

  the police found bobs letter and also the wire that
i had sent her at san francisco and they had wired
washington of their suspicions and asked that federal
warrants be issued for both of us the department of
justice soon located us and the warrants were for-
warded to chicago and we were both arrested

  fortunately my wire had been so worded that there
was really nothing to hold me on except possibly as a
material witness and i was admitted to bail and was
able to go back to the hospital and keep an eye on bob

  he recovered slowly and i wished that he would
recover even more slowly for he was pronounced fit
for travel too soon to suit me i figured that he was
safe there in the hospital and i would have kept him
there longer the day that the surgeon said he could
be discharged was two days before we had figured out
that he would die in ohio hawaii being a territory
he had been arrested on a federal warrant and no ex-
tradition proceedings were necessary the department
of justice men told us that we would both be taken to
washington for a preliminary hearing before being sent
to hawaii for trial we didnt learn of this plan to
take him east until the day that he was pronounced
fit to travel

  i was still free on bail and you can bet your life
that i allowed no grass to grow under my feet i
got the best legal talent in chicago to handle the local
end and i wired to new york and got the best legal

talent there on the job i told the new york men to
go to washington and get busy the orders that i
gave to all the lawyers were that no matter what else
happened or what it cost they were to keep bob from
being taken east for seventy-two hours after that
time had passed nothing would matter

  the lawyers did their best the first order that
came from washington was to the effect that bob was
to be taken at once but just before train time another
wire came ordering a delay of seventy-two hours
when we saw the second wire we shook hands and
told each other that we had won the battle

  so we had for a time but the next morning another
message came from the attorney-generals office stating
that the delay had been rescinded and that he was to
be brought at once i asked what train we were to
take and sure enough it was one that would put him
into lima just on time to meet the wreck that we had
predicted

  our chicago lawyers tried to do something but
they didnt accomplish anything except to run up huge
bills the train that was chosen was a poor one and
as a last resource i offered to pay the extra fare for
bob and both his guards if they would take another
train that left chicago three hours earlier and which
passed through lima over four hours before the acci-
dent was due to happen the choice of the train was
more or less a matter of choice for the department of
justice operators who were to guard him and when
i bribed them to the extent of offering to provide a
drawing room and free meals for all concerned they
agreed that it would be no dereliction of duty on their
part to take an earlier train

  we took the earlier train and everything went well
until we left fort wayne indiana we were rolling
along on schedule time and again we were congratu-
lating ourselves on having won out about five miles
out of fort wayne our train came to a grinding stop
we stood for some time and when the conductor came
through i asked him the trouble

   burned out bearing in our engine he said we
have sent for another one and well be on our way
soon

   how long will we be delayed  i asked

   not over three hours he told me

  bob looked at me with a funny smile there was
nothing that i could say

the three hours passed and then some it was

  jl nearly four hours before a relief engine was
hooked on and we started we were still a little ahead
of the accident time but it was soon evident that the
relief engine was not as powerful as the big one usually
used on the limited and that we were losing time bob
looked at his watch as we neared lima

   i guess i have about twelve minutes left he said
with a sort of a sick grin

  i tried to laugh him out of that mood but i had no
luck in point of fact i had begun to think that he
was right suddenly an idea struck him

  ive got time enough to make my will he said
give me a pen and some paper
futility



  i handed him my pen and he proceeded to write out
a will in which he left everything he had in the world
to me the department of justice men were willing
to humor him and they signed as witnesses when
the witnessing was completed bob handed the will
to me

   good-bye old man he said you will survive the
wreck all right you know and this will fixes it up so
that you get what plunder we have gathered dont
worry about me since mabel has gone i cant say
that death has any very great terrors for me

  he turned and looked out of the window i had
a pretty big lump in my throat and i felt like hitting
the detectives who took the whole matter as a huge
joke we swung around a curve

   this must be about the time and place said bob
as he looked at his watch i hope that none of the
rest of you-

  we were suddenly thrown forward and our brakes
squealed i tried to recover my balance and then
came a terrific crash as our train ran head-on into a
freight that should have been sidetracked i recovered
consciousness two hours later in a hospital in lima
my first question was about bob he had been taken
from the wreck dead

  toms voice died away and i sat for a moment in
silence

  a curious tale i said at length it was a funny
coincidence

  mabels death might have been a coincidence he
replied and i was tempted at first to think so but
bobs wasnt i am firmly convinced that neither of
them can be explained by that method it was merely
that our predictograph told the truth that is why i
told you that i have little interest in life because i
have no future

  you said that you would have sent for me if
you hadnt received my letter saying that i was on my
way to new york i reminded him why

  for this reason he said as i told you i have
less than a year of life left and no one knows anything
about the predictograph i am a lone wolf and have
no one dependent on me i will leave my entire fortune
which is over twenty millions to you on one condi-
tion

  and that is i asked

  on the condition that you will let me teach you
how to operate the machine and that you will let me
figure your life span for you

  what if i refuse to take it on those terms

  in that case i am going to destroy it

  i thought rapidly for a moment the prospect was
certainly alluring riches beyond even my dreams
would be mine and with them almost endless power
i could tell in a moment whether the merger we were
working on would go through and that piece of in-
formation alone would enable me to make another for-
tune in the stock market i could find out just how
happy and successful i was going to be and that
knowledge of future success might help to tide me over
some periods of hard going on the other hand sup-
pose it predicted failure and misery instead since its
predictions could not be evaded would not that fore-
knowledge sour my whole life

  next i thought of rose i was going to ask her a
very important question when i returned to peru if
the merger went through i could know her answer
in advance and would also know just how long we
would each live- here the thought of bobs experience
intruded itself i gave a searching look at tom
wallaces face and made up my mind

  no tom i said rising i dont believe that i
want it you had better destroy it

  im sorry he said in his toneless voice as he rose
  why i asked slightly surprised

  it would have given me a fresh hope of life if you
had accepted he replied the predictograph told me
that you would refuse

sails tells a fantastic story

     sat near the main hangar on poppy field
  five miles from san bernardino when sails
  came in he made a perfect three point
  landing and sprang from his plane with
  youthful agility and ran straight to me
  there was an anxious look in his eagle eyes he
  turned with intent glances to the sky from which he
  had flown

     something wrong i asked he shook his head
   like a mad bull he shaded his eyes with his hand
   then rubbed them furiously his big body was shaking
   like a leaf

      yes hells broke loose he said dramatically and
   again he turned and looked into the northern sky i
   arose and stood beside him

     claxon i asked cracked up

     he breathed furiously yes-smashed and ten
   thousand feet up

      i stepped back and stared at him and studied him long
   and hard before i could speak

you dont mean he smashed in the air-collision

     sails was nervously upset he did not answer im-
   mediately

      come into the office metters and close the door
   he said and be sure and keep this under your hat for
   the present

     we went inside he sat across the desk from me
   still shaking his head as if some fantastic unbelievable
   scene had come before his eyes apparently he had suf-
   fered a great shock but i could not bear his silence

      good god man tell me i pleaded

     hardly know where to begin he said between
   breaths any way met-
   ters a flying man expects
   the air to be clean of-of
   v physical obstructions does
   he not

sure
what-

he ignored me after that

   it seemed that he was ab-
   sorbed in a nightmare and
   talking in a fitful sleep

   claxon and i were at
   eleven thousand feet when

   my motor spat i gave up the climb and leveled off he
   followed me-he was always a good student-and i
   thought it would be funny to drop a barrel and see if
   he did the same and again leveled off a few hundred
   yards to the east i climbed again and he followed
   again at ten thousand we leveled off and started at
   full throttle back to the field when i saw a curious object
   before us i dont believe he saw it it seemed like a

sort of dirigible car made of glass and there was a man
standing inside it and staring at us thats all i saw
of him when claxon smashed the waco right into the
thing

  i gasped i could not doubt sails

  i circled and started back to get a good view of
whatever it was up there i got only a glimpse of it
before it disappeared like a bullet into the sky above
it looked like a huge glass fish turned on its side with
a cabin suspended underneath and it was transparent
and i could see inside the thing shades were drawn
in the after part of the cabin he stopped abruptly
perhaps i shouldnt discuss this with you metters
he said i know you wont give it much credit-no
one could be expected to i hardly believe it myself
but youve got to report to the commission about
the accident i reminded him where did the waco
crash to the ground 

  didnt see it after the crash i suppose its about
ten miles north of here in the hills-if it came down
you doubt that it did

i dont know he sighed still looking at the sky
through the window whatever happens dont repeat
this the thing will be settled somehow if the in-
ternational had a supercharger id find that phantom
and-but its hopeless i cant believe it even after
seeing it myself he arose and faced me tell me
am i really alive and talking to you or is it a dream 
it must be real i assured him i think youd
better catch some sleep sails and ill get into the
jenny and try to find claxon possibly he is alive
dont expect to find him alive he moaned he
was the best student i ever had but he isnt alive they
tried to sell him a parachute with the waco and he
laughed in their faces the
poor devil he never ex-
pected that

this is an age in which
few things are doubted
we credit science with the
power of creating what we
dream about confused as
i was i could not doubt
salts i liked him im-
mensely though neither of
us had a single material in-
centive for our binding friendship i was on his field
merely from choice i had cruised in from fort
worth a month before i had bided my time wonder-
ing what to do with myself next he had been
thoroughly unselfish with me every facility for
repairing my ship was at my disposal in return i had
hopped a few passengers for him on crowded sundays
we often flew to los angeles in my plane going down

                     aviation seems to have gripped the imagination of
                   the more enterprising populace just as radio did a few
                   years ago its a tremendous field and will in all likelihood
                   i said but exceed anything we can picture even in our wildest flights
                   of fancy the space hermit may seem fantastic but
                   it is hardly implausible and suggests a number of interest-
                   ing new scientific theories about the outer air that are
                   ingenious to say the least it is an absorbing tale cleverly
                   written and furnishes much food for thought-and perhaps
                   for experimentation


 i saw that i had landed on the top of the phantom i left the motor running at twelve hundred and climbed nervously out
 on top my eyes fell upon a ladder that presumably led down into the cabin and with light steps i walked toward it




amazing stories

in the evening and returning after midnight his great
love was training young men to fly until then he
had never lost a student he is still training them
but there is little heart in his effort his record is
broken and he has for an excuse only a most fantastic
story i am going to back up his story whether or not
the commission chooses to believe what i relate i feel
that i must talk of it if only for my own sake

  a three-day search revealed claxons waco piled up
on a mesa in the hills near san bernardino it was
crushed beyond recognition and still strapped in as
he was when came out of the barrel was claxons
broken body an ambulance hauled the remains back
to the city where the broken-hearted and bewildered
sails assisted in the funeral arrangements

  the next morning i ordered a supercharger from los
angeles which came by plane three hours later by
nightfall i had installed the apparatus on my ship the
next day i consoled sails as best i could and took off
i cruised all morning and set down at san diego for
oil and gas that afternoon i climbed to eighteen
thousand feet and leveled off nothing was in sight
i flew until twilight before i set down again at poppy
field sails came out to meet me as i taxied up to the
hangar he wished to go with me the next day he
could not rest for thinking of the phantom

  we searched the sky of california for three weeks
at last we gave it up and shook our heads in despair
for all we knew the phantom might have been near us
a hundred times because as sails had explained it was
transparent and could hardly be detected in the sky

  weeks passed before i began to think seriously of
the incident i had tried to attribute sails story to
mirages i tried to invent a thousand excuses for his
having such a vision i attributed it to shell shock in
the war optical illusions or the fact that he was hiding
the real facts of claxons crash i left san bernardino
early in april and went to seattle the weather was
rougher than i expected so i packed up and started for
los angeles

the phantom ship

after the incident at poppy field i always flew
at a high altitude i was flying a hamilton with
 extra long wings and slow landing speed but
the ship was capable of one hundred and fifty miles
per hour under full load when i left seattle i shipped
my baggage to los angeles by express and in its place
i filled my fuel tanks to capacity i had decided to
make the southern city in one hop

  i climbed to thirteen thousand feet before i leveled
off to look down upon a storm torn array of forests
which was rapidly being obscured by thick black clouds
that seemed to come from every direction

  i was thankful to allah that i had chosen the upper
course for the flying was smooth and i was comfort-
able i had that feeling of independence which is
doubly wonderful to the aviator i could turn wherever
i pleased and stay as long as i wished

  i crossed the california-oregon line at nine thousand
feet it was three oclock in the afternoon and the sun
was shining only in spots i climbed to nineteen thou-

sand feet before leveling off then i sat back to watch
the supercharger do its work

   my ceiling was as clear as a crystal rifts of clouds
obscured my view of the earth i had dunsmuir in
mind i thought of getting my bearings there by the
hotel travelers which i knew to face directly south
but i was afraid of the mountains so i climbed again
and approximated my position by my speed and wind
allowance and the drift indicator when i leveled off
i was shivering from cold the altimeter showed
twenty-seven thousand feet in trying to divert my
mind from the penetrating cold up there i finally
thought of sails

for weeks i had been trying to attribute his story
to a mirage or a reflection in the glass enclosure of
his big international but i could not forget the fact
that claxon had really crashed the waco i did not
wish to be so unfaithful as to believe sails had fabri-
cated the story suddenly i was conscious of some-
thing a few hundred yards forward and below me i
turned to look at it it was the most amazing sight i
ever saw or expect to see

  it was a great transparent object the length of an
ocean going steamer when i say transparent i mean
that it was as clear as glass so clear that it did not
reflect the sun that shone upon it it was shaped like
a dirigible but it was not the conventional type of air-
ship it was oval fitting sails description of the
object he had encountered like a great fish turned on
its side on its bottom which i could see because of
its transparency was a cabin perhaps seventy feet in
length in which i could see two people

was astounded to say the least i could not be-
lieve the giant ship was an instrument of man it
seemed like a fantastic object from another planet
perhaps from mars but i knew that to be impossible
i swung closer and cut my motor to the idling point and
hovered above thinking that i would pass onward and
be compelled to turn in order to get another view of it
but i discovered that it was moving about the same
speed as my own ship i noticed that the two people
were a man and a woman suddenly the man looked up
up through perhaps forty feet of whatever his ship
was built of and stared at me frantically his hand
shot out to an object which i took to be a switch the
great ship started gathering speed i did not wish to
lose an opportunity for a great adventure my wheels
were almost rolling on his upper surface when i saw
that the nose of his ship was farther ahead than it was
before i had dropped over him i dipped and felt my
wheels touch something hard i shoved the stick for-
ward and placed it in a becket then i opened the
window peering out i saw that i had landed on the
top of the phantom i left the motor running at twelve
hundred and climbed nervously out on top my eyes
fell upon a ladder that presumably led down into the
cabin i walked with light steps to it grasped the sup-
port and looked down the bottom of the ladder was
in a room in the long cabin which by this time i could
see was filled with different objects most of which
the space hermit



were made of the transparent material which formed
the ship the man watched me closely as i started to
climb down when i had reached safety below the sur-
face of what i supposed was the gas bag his hand shot
back to the switch the great ship gave a lurch and
rolled quickly over before i realized what had hap-
pened i saw my hamilton slide from its landing place
and flutter and spin on its way to the earth

  i suddenly felt my shoulders thinking of my para-
chute i had left it in the cabin of my plane i was
alone with two people whom i had never seen they
might be two remarkable people they again might be
two maniacs i decided to face the adventure in good
spirits and climbed on down the ladder until i felt my
feet touch something solid i looked about for the
people i had seen the woman had disappeared but
the man stood there facing me

he was about forty years old his face was clean
shaven and his features were nobly formed his
hair was long about the temples and gray as if it had
suddenly turned so he was six feet tall and well pro-
portioned his mouth was firm and his deep blue
eyes seemed to pierce my very soul i tried to speak
finally i managed to say something in the way of an
apology

  i am sorry to have intruded sir

  he drew a deep breath still looking at me as if i
were a child and helpless in his hands

  i too am sorry my friend that i was compelled to
destroy your airplane he answered but it was quite
necessary please follow me he led the way into
a cabin and pointed to a transparent chair a table
three feet wide and six in length stood between us on
it were teacups of glass and a plate of some mealy
white and yellow substance which i supposed was
food

  you may refresh yourself he said politely for
the time i am engaged he bowed and hurried into
the next room i felt a sudden lurch of the ship as
if she were gathering way i looked below me at the
earth it was receding farther and farther away we
were going at a terrific speed then when my host
finished his arrangements he came into the cabin pulled
a lever above his head and sat down to watch me

  you have not tasted the food he suggested

  whereupon i tried to smile and reluctantly tasted the
dish it had a peculiar taste as if it were blended from
several foods i consumed the contents of the dish with
evident enjoyment even under the strain of evident
careful scrutiny by my host i drank from the cup
but it was not tea that i drank when the simple meal
was finished i lighted a cigaret and took several quick
puffs while he watched me seemingly amused that
was the cue to my attempt at conversation he de-
clined my offer of a smoke settled himself in his chair
and waited

  i do not know where to begin captain i said
though this is an intrusion i am curious to know
about you and this strange craft must i attribute this
discovery to your genius 

tt is mine he said proudly i built it it is per-
x feet you had better remove your flying suit as
the temperature is adjusted here he pointed at the
instrument board upon which were a number of
switches levers and dials i noted the thin linen suit
he wore and proceeded to take off my own heavy
clothing strangely enough i was thinking of the
woman yjyio was now conceakd behind a drawn shade
in the forward end of the cabin

  finally my host asked thoughtfully what is hap-
pening on earth is there a new president of your
country 

  i was amazed but i answered him with studied non-
chalance the same one-another term i said

  i thought as much was his only comment

  i mean the silent one i explained

  he nodded as if he understood

  i would like to know something of your life here
captain i urged this is all so very strange to me
that it is fantastic i indicated the craft in general

  by what right do you ask to know of my life
asked the captain you have no right to be aboard
my ship

  my apology captain i answered sheepishly at
least i cannot leave unless you wish to see me die a
horrible death i lost a friend by your ship

  he looked off through the wall of the cabin into the
western sky a great sadness seemed to come over
him i wish death to no one he said he arose and
paced the floor for several minutes then he turned
to me and said firmly you shall never leave this ship
sir it will be well for you to resign yourself to your
fate-particularly since it will not be uncomfortable
after all

  you choose to keep me aboard even against my
will i demanded

  you came of your own accord he said calmly
looking me squarely in the eyes i cannot release
you i have my own reasons for that however
you shall be comfortable at all times if you give me
your word of honor that you will never try to bring
my craft to earth

  and if i do not give you my word of honor

  if you do not-if you dare violate the hospitality
you have forced me to bestow upon you-i shall over-
come you and force you to abide by my wishes

  i was in a perplexing position

  in that case i promise you i shall never interfere
with your plans i said a little relieved

  he extended his hand and i took it

  thank you mr metters he said radiantly now
i shall proceed to explain all this to you

  we both sat down when he had reclined in his
chair he began

  perhaps you remember some years ago-three to
be exact-when news came of the disappearance of
martin hedron the scientist whether you remember
that or not you will recall that a great explosion rocked
the countryside in southern missouri about that time
i recall both i said

  i am hedron now in order to grasp my explana-
tion of how this ship came to be built you must attend


amazing stories

to every detail otherwise you would find cause to
doubt me do you realize that we have not been on
the earth for three years 

  his words astounded me i wanted to ask about
the woman i had seen but decided to bide my time

  it is hardly believable captain hedron i said
he smiled and continued his story

martin hedrons story

ettling back again his strange voice came in
a swift staccato

  nothing is of so very much importance met-
ters you may think it strange that i have that philos-
ophy and still accomplish what to you seems fantastic
great-impossible i myself look upon these things i
have invented as mere playthings that is why i have
renounced the world i care not for the material pos-
sessions for which you struggle i want only peace
and silence why i look down there now and see the
changes and growth in your cities the long lines of
concrete pavement that stretch across your nation the
steamships and airplanes at which you marvel and i
do not care to know of them i remain as far from
your turbid world as possible i hope i shall never be
obliged to communicate with the earth again which is
to say that i shall be buried in the air do not marvel
at that neither should yoi marvel at this airship

  this ship is five hundred feet in length eighty feet
wide amidships and is perhaps forty-five feet high
which includes the cabin it is built of transparent
steel the discovery of which i made while experiment-
ing with machinery for taking substance from the air
i had already discovered the means of taking palatable
food and water from the air not to mention the salt
and all other requirements of the human body in the
discovery of the metal of which this ship is built i
found that it was as hard and tough as steel and
lighter than aluminum i therefore built my electro-
magnetic motors of this material they too are trans-
parent save for the parts of copper and iron which
constitute the electro-magnets the gas bag is built of
the same material with many girders running cross-
wise and lengthwise of the bag it is filled with helium
which i have also succeeded in taking from the air i
have a machine for the purpose of making each there-
fore when your friend crashed into me near the mohave
desert and broke a dangerous hole in the forward end
of the bag i gained altitude as quickly as possible i
made the necessary amount of what you may call trans-
parent aluminum and the necessary repair i found
that the gas in that particular cell was slightly heavier
than the other from the onrush of air when the plane
struck so i turned to my faithful machine for ex-
tracting helium from the air and i filled it i tell you
i can do anything with air

  perhaps you wonder why i choose to keep my
work a secret it is not from choice if i should give
my secret to the world i should never find peace as it
is i can rest here above the clouds assured that no one
knows or cares where i am and this solitude is what
i most desire the woman you saw a moment ago
is my daughter i have often wondered if she came

with me only because she loves me but at times i
know that she is far far happier than she would be
on earth among the jealousy hatred dishonesty and
heartlessness of the people

  four years ago i finally succeeded in inventing all
these machines i took my daughter with me and hid
in a valley in missouri summer came with the proper
density of air to assist my metal-making machine and
i went to work after six months labor i succeeded
in finishing thebag structure then i built the cabin
beneath and installed all these machines the motors
of this craft are forward in the nose they are silent
there are ten of them but they drive a single propeller
which is thirty feet in diameter the electricity neces-
sary for operating the motors is generated by auxiliary
propellers and a dynamo which supply exceeds the de-
mands i have perpetual motion if i desire i can
cruise at ten miles an hour or two hundred i have the
bag so constructed that it resists wind pressure it is
the strongest ship in the air

tut after having started the building of my ship

  lj i found that i had many curious visitors about
i was at a loss as to what to tell them i finally decided
to say that i was experimenting and that should any-
thing in the way of an explosion occur they must not
be surprised and that instruction for the disposal of
my belongings in such a case were unnecessary as i
had no friends or relatives who would be interested
these people accepted my alarm with fear and dread
i never saw a single person after that

  my daughter was the little soldier always she
worked with me helped me build this craft in its en-
tirety it is named for her the glorie i shall speak
more of her later suffice to say that you must never
speak to her nor must you ever come nearer her than
you are now she has finally caught the spell of the
silence of the sky and she is happy

  but let me go back to my story when we finally
succeeded in completing this ship which may seem un-
believable to you we were at a loss to know how we
should escape from the earth unseen i recalled hav-
ing told the people of a possible impending explosion
so on the night of our take-off i arranged a huge charge
of nitroglycerin in the scraps of material which were
left i set a long fuse and fired it we simply got
into the cabin and took control cast off the moorings
and disappeared into the sky perhaps the natives
down there in that country think i was a maniac i
do not know what was reported-

  the papers told of an eccentric building-a long
glass house it was described by the natives i cut in
they related a story of being warned and of being
awakened one night by the explosion which supposedly-
destroyed you and your structure

  he smiled as if he were greatly pleased at this

  we have never touched earth since we have
cruised over the entire sqrface of the globe since
the accident which killed your friend we have been
across the pacific and onto russia i do not really
know my bearings now-and i dont care i can go to
sleep to-night and awake to-morrow morning in any
the space hermit



european country you wish to name in fact we are
on our way east now to-morrow i shall show you
the seine and the eiffel tower by the way i saw a
monoplane crossing the atlantic two months ago i fol-
lowed him from midocean to the english channel and
saw him sail away to paris and perhaps to glory

  i gasped he did i said breathlessly he is the
greatest flier on earth

  he smiled and shook his head you are mistaken
metters i am the greatest flier on earth

  you are not on earth i corrected no one knows
of you you are keeping the fruits of your powers
from mankind but in your last words i detect a
yearning for the world and its ways there is still a
touch of vanity

  a yearning for the world captain hedron spat
at the earth below the filthy world why should
i give the fruits of my labors to that race of noth-
ings they have done nothing for me yet i have
a right to vanity i alone can conquer the world with
this ship

  perhaps you are right i said finally

  his eyes blazed yes i am right metters nor
do i wish to hear a single criticism from you again
do you understand that 

  i assured him i did

  he arose and looked off into the clouds his hand
sought a door knob he opened the door and started
into the next room i want peace he said his
voice was hoarse and scarcely audible

  he closed the door softly and locked me in the
room then he went to the instrument board and
changed a switch or two i felt the rush of heavy air
into my cabin and wondered at its warmth he turned
a dial and pulled another switch upon which move-
ment the great glorie rolled slightly her bow lifted
and she gathered speed in the darkness of my first
night aboard

in the cabin of the glories

the next few hours constituted the most weird
experience of my life over which i look with
a feeling of humility and utter unimportance i
had thought that my vocation as an aviator afforded me
the respect of science and the world at large until i
began to assume that i was a pioneer and a leader of
men yet fearless as i had been all my life i had
never been awe-stricken or fascinated by my work in
fact everything i did seemed routine-like and ordi-
nary even to stepping into space from an airplane which
had conked and dropping ten thousand feet to earth
and once i dodged bullets from a machine gun for
hours at a time i had seen the works of science and
invention and read the words of wise philosophers
not one of these even in its deepest meaning was im-
portant after i found myself in the cabin of the glorie
the people of the earth all the things of the earth be-
came simple and ordinary meaningless nothings it was
the attitude into which captain hedron had initiated
me

  again as the great ship sped on her way through

                  r

the trackless wastes of the upper strata i wondered
how one could be happy without experiencing the trials
of the earth i thought of the girl the captains daugh-
ter and wondered if she really wished to be with her
father here where she could not dance and dress and
enjoy the beautiful things of life i wondered-far into
the night then the captain came and sat with me to
explain in his own philosophical way the fascinating
mysteries which surrounded me

  we have not changed our natures since leaving the
world metters he said we like all human beings
are bound to the craving for the new and to the love
and respect for the old thus we have music a series
of pipes through which the wind blows while we are
under way you will hear my daughter play before
long however i trust you will abide by my wishes
and never speak to her leave her in the spell of the
silent ether

  i nodded half-heartedly

  those motors are the most wonderful of all inven-
tions with the possible exception of the metal of which
this craft is built and i think our lives would be in-
complete without even one of the machines i have in-
vented for instance the machine for extracting food
from the air is so constructed as to furnish the proper
nourishment and balance to maintain our bodies to
you that seems intricate and complicated but it is the
most simple of my works

  captain hedron followed my glance earthward to a
maze of light that illuminated the sky

  to me only a light metters to you a city-
denver

  he arose and paced the deck for some moments

  the people of the earth being so far behind in
scientific accomplishment will tell you that all things
come of the ground to them this is true but they
have yet to investigate and explore the air

  there are three things aboard this craft that came
of the earth these clothes we wear the copper wir-
ing in the motors and the heavy pieces of iron which
constitute the cores of the electro-magnets were it
necessary i could do away with these possibly i shall
do so in the near future with the exception of clothing
of which i have a large supply

  your life is not going to be wasted metters you
are going to see the wonders of the air ten days from
now you shall be at the north pole and perhaps be
ignorant of the fact look now at the moon is it not
a whiter moon than you have ever seen

  i agreed with him

  we are now at an altitude of forty thousand feet
we have been climbing steadily for thirty minutes you
saw denver from an altitude of twenty-eight thousand
feet looking from the west you are now the same
distance east of the city only you are higher the
lights now appear only as tiny specks on the earth

  but does this never become monotonous captain
i asked are there not times when your heart aches
to meet old friends and to visit old places at this
moment would you not love to be discussing the possi-
bilities of your inventions with edison or ford or h
g wells


amazing stories

his face turned a livid white i had not thought
it possible that my words would produce such an
effect he raised his hand as if to ward off an attack

  stop metters never mention that to me again
never mention the earth never mention men avoid
me i wish to god i had never seen you i wish i
were villain enough to destroy you

  he sank into one of the transparent chairs and placed
his face in his hands he ignored my apology

  you will find a tube of food from the machine
water is in the hydrant i shall furnish you with an
electrically-treated substance which will stop the growth
of your beard you shall never have cause to be un-
comfortable there is no dirt in the upper strata but
you may as well resign yourself to a life in the air i
shall not reveal my works to another person

  you may visit the main cabin at will and play the
organ or study the action of the air at the different
altitudes you will find great pleasure in exploring
the heavens and noting the peculiar formation of other
planets but do not expect to visit them perhaps it
is impossible perhaps not but an absolute vacuum
exists between the planets a gas bag would never
endure there i once tried the experiment of cruising
at an altitude of twenty miles thinking i should gain
such an altitude as to remain motionless while the earth
turned beneath me the experiment did not work i
found that in order to accomplish it i would have to
do away with my gas bag and in so doing i would land
down there he pointed earthward

  i shall never land metters i hate the world i
detest little men with all their vanity and stupidity
they are so many parrots and monkeys so many
leeches and selfish fools even you are a fool metters
and so am i but we were made thus our limitations
make us fools the natures of the people on earth
make them fools

  i see them following the call of an exploiter at-
tracted by the mirage of wealth or the flame of love and
happiness neither are gained in their entirety among
the mass i find a few whose minds are not earthbound
whose hearts are bigger than the hearts of those who
surround them but those same ones are suppressed
i myself dreamed of a world in which all men were
working to make each other happy i dreamed of
truth and understanding everywhere i dreamed of
freedom from the domination of dishonest and corrupt
people and i was following an illusion i was happy
with the illusion until i lost the mother of my daugh-
ter

  tears filled the eyes of the captain his face shone
in the light of the moon and there was written upon his
face such a message as i had never read before it
told of a soul still in captivity searching the depths
of logic and learning to find the great first cause and
ultimate of the universe i saw through the years of
his struggle to accomplish his work daring not to give
the fruits of labor to men because he could find oblivion
from earthly cares solely through keeping them a secret
i saw his eyes ever searching the heavens for a star
his soul ever crying out for a sign and his bewilder-
ment at the riddle of the universe he told me of

the death of his wife a strange person who loved and
understood him who could sit with him in silence and
read the innermost thoughts of his mind even to those
which he was at a loss to express and i thought of
his daughter the woman i had so wished to see but
concerning whom i dared ask nothing

  he arose in silence and pointed to the floor indi-
cating that i should sleep thereon then he turned
and disappeared through the door over the clicking
noise of the latch i thought i detected a whisper
peace be still

  it was not thus with me

a momentous decision

i wondered about professor hedron who had
become the phantom captain of a phantom ship
and yet despite his revelations to me i knew him
to be insane but i could readily overlook his eccen-
tricities even those which prompted in him the desire
to renounce the world despite the fact that i did ex-
cuse him and granted that he had the right to do as he
wished i could not overlook the fact that he had a
daughter aboard i did not have her own word that she
wanted to be there and i thought of the material side
of my adventure the world renown and riches which
would reward the inventor of such machinery as i had
seen

  i hope i can be forgiven but i really started that
moment on a train of thought which seemed a breach
of confidence i wondered about the possibility of re-
vealing these things to the world i wondered whether
or not i could induce the professor to land his craft
before the startled eyes of millions

  captain hedron dropped to an altitude of thirteen
thousand feet and gave me a view of paris but know-
ing there were many aircraft operating in the vicinity
he immediately climbed again and the outlines of the
city were lost behind clouds i believe that was my
last sight of paris i do not know we remained at
a high altitude for weeks i was alone for the greater
part of the time professor hedron ignored me
once he startled me with the announcement that we
were over the north pole only to say five days later
that we were cruising over the argentine

  my food came through a tube from the machine i
could eat at will for there were no hours time meant
nothing to the professor but the monotony wore on
me i felt myself becoming queer then i began to
wonder how he and his daughter could withstand the
loneliness of the upper strata in a glasslike cage
where there were no flowers and trees no variety save
a different view of the moon and stars there was not
even variety in the weather one of the machines
which the professor had so deftly made of that strange
metal adjusted the temperature in the cabin and i
did not venture from my cabin until i had been aboard
two weeks when i did fare forth into the main cabin
where the strange organ was located i found nothing
but the same glassy deck the same emptiness that had
almost driven me mad but a strange incident took
place while i was there i suddenly saw the curtains
the space hermit



of the girls cabin being raised and i looked upon a

miracle it seemed to me

g lor ie was in her early twenties when i first
saw her she was white and beautiful with brown
hair that had been allowed to grow and fall about her
shoulders even here where she had been cramped up
for three solid years she moved gracefully as she came
toward me our eyes met as she came down the aisle
and opened the door leading to the main cabin i was
watching her with the deepest curiosity she closed the
door and stood looking at me and it seemed that a look
of great relief came into her face i read in her eyes
the emptiness of her life i knew at that moment that
she did not wish to be aboard the airship i swear i
saw her very soul the soul of a person who was en-
tirely immune from earthly temptations but who hun-
gered for the things that nature meant her to have-
clothes and friends and flowers and trees

  i dared not speak to her i waited for what seemed
ages for her to move on and yet i did not wish her to
go i wanted to talk with her despite the orders of her
father perhaps he had warned her for she finally
did turn away she tripped across the deck gathering
up the filmy gown she wore and seated herself at the
organ she cast one more glance at me a look that
must have made us both happy and then she played
as i had never heard any one play before

  it was the song of a far-off planet a weird and beau-
tiful tune that struck my heart like a bullet and sent the
blood to my brain it was fantastic and soul stirring
and it seemed to tell of the infinite of which we so
fruitlessly dream it sent my imagination to other
planets beside our own it brought pictures of war
and destruction putting me in mind of mars then i
remembered something else that seemed to fit the mo-
ment and the music she played it was a battle be-
tween my plane and another plane over the german
lines in  the weird drone of death dealing-mon-
sters that winged their way through the clouds i shall
always associate the two experiences for they both
teemed with mystery and fantasy for men did not seem
real when they flew out to fight then the music broke
suddenly as if the life of its maker had been snuffed
out in the great battle that is always going on in every
human heart glorie looked at me again her face
beaming with joy she looked at me for two minutes
without changing her expression and then her hands
sought the invisible keys again she seemed to read
my mind and to know the music that drew the deepest
sentiment from my heart

  then she played mother machree can you im-
agine that tune at an altitude of thirty thousand feet in
an airship traveling at the speed of two hundred miles
per hour and yet going to no place  the impossibility
of it impressed me it was not right that woman
was not happy never could be there i was deciding
to do something about it when a strong hand grasped
my shoulder and i turned to face the professor

  i shall never forget his face at that moment it was
a great rage that had overcome him and i attributed
his anger to the tune glorie had played before i

could speak he pointed to the door i looked again
at his daughter and saw her staring at me wild eyed
and helpless and hurt then i went to my own cabin

  i saw him caress the hand of his daughter as she sat
there watched him turn with tears in his eyes and go
back to the control room then i made my final de-
cision to break my word of honor to him nor would
i ask him to release me to him that would mean only
one thing i did not even think of what glorie might
think of me for breaking my word

  for three days i studied the actions of the captain
as he maneuvered the ship about the skies in that
time i gained an appreciable knowledge about the hand-
ling of the craft i learned that one of the levers
manipulated the elevators that another increased the
speed of the great invisible propeller at the nose i
saw that the turning of a dial set in motion the machine
which forced the food that i ate through the tube which
ended in my cabin another lever he used to bank
the ship this lever worked on the same principle as an
airplane control stick and lowered and raised the great
fins at the side thus i gained my knowledge of the
working of the ship i decided to put that knowledge
to use immediately

a strange tomb

the helpless look in glories eyes told me the
truth she had been forced by her eccentric
father to remain a prisoner on the airship she
had been powerless all those three years to induce
him to return to the earth i decided it was for me to
release her from her phantom prison but i knew i
must be cautious pofessor hedron was a powerful
man in both mind and body i did not wish to injure
him nor to have the disrespect of his daughter i knew
if i acquired control of the ship by stealth and bound
him with strips torn from my clothes that i could
speak to her that was the course i decided to follow

  two weeks later as i reckoned time we lifted
through a maze of fog somewhere in the tropics it
was mid-day in the sweltering heat of the sun the
professor seemed to have no control over intense heat
nor did altitude appear to solve the problem this
enraged him he turned the craft about and headed
north my next view of the earth came one evening
four days later we were cruising slowly when i went
into the main cabin and looked through the telescope
from her own room glorie watched me closely-i
thought with intense speculation i decided that moment
not to defer my plan of action any longer but the
telescope did not reveal our position we were over
a great plain and about us as far as we could see
was a haze that reached into the sky like a great en-
gulfing tide

  i left the telescope nonchalantly and turned to pacing
the deck still glorie watched me i tried to face her
squarely and found it impossible she must have de-
tected my purpose at that moment for her eyes widened
and she smiled upon me when i looked again it was a
pitiful wistful smile like that of a child that wishes
something for which it dares not ask i smiled back

concluding the sequel to the english at the north pole
what went before

  jichard shandon receives a letter signed kz

  mr captain of the forward offering him the post of chief
- officer on a new brig giving him full instructions and
sufficient funds for the building of the vessel a visit to the
bank confirms the statement in the letter in regard to the funds
so he orders the brig to be built according to specifications and
engages james wall as his second mate and a man named john-
son as boatswain johnson selects and engages the balance of
the crew

  dr clawbonny the ships doctor duly arrives just as the
building of the forward is about completed in accordance with
advice which shandon received from the unknown captain
and on the th of april when the brig is almost ready to sail
the captains dog duk by name arrives the captain had
apprised shandon of the animals expected arrival and even
ordered a kennel to be built for him

  the balance of the crew consists of simpson the harpooner
bell the carpenter foker the ice-master and garry bolton
brunton gripper clifton warren and pen sailors

  though the captain is expected to make himself known at
the moment of starting he only sends a last minute letter of
instruction as to the course of the expedition they start off
for points north through davis strait baffin bay and clear
into the arctic regions and-following later mysterious instruc-
tions by letter-into arctic waters

  it is not until after the brig and crew leave upernavik and
the icebergs become more numerous and the waters become
almost unnavigable and some of the sailors begin to threaten
mutiny that the captain who had passed as the sailor named
garry appears and discloses his plans he is none other than
captain hatteras who had some years before spent an enor-
mous amount of money and sacrificed the lives of all of his
crew in a mad attempt to reach the north pole and plant the

english flag there he offers the men a tempting additional
sum of money for every degree they push beyond the nd
parallel and the men eagerly accept the proposition-for the
time being at least-and they start pushing ahead again

  but more hardships follow and sickness due to the freezing
temperature sets in and mutiny becomes imminent once more
but by christmas it is impossible to move ahead and there is
no more coal aboard the cmo decide to use some of the
wood of the forward that can best be spared and then bell
remembers that about  miles across the ice from where they
are marooned there was a deposit of coal which was left there
some years earlier by a rescue expedition hatteras decides to
seek the coal he the doctor bell and simpson start out
accompanied by the faithful duk johnson was left behind to
watch the sloop simpson however finally succumbs to the
hardships attending this trip across the ice-fields and is buried
en route

  when the rest of the group reach the station they find no
trace of any coal or provisions but they discover a cairn a
man is found buried in the snow the doctor finds the way tluit
he can be revived they learn later that he is an american and
came on the ship porpoise

  the party return to find the forward in flames and johnson
doing his best to fight the fire hope is not lost however for
when the american altamont regains consciousness he tells
them that the porpoise is only a little way further north amply
provisioned with food and coal and they start off on sleds
toward the american ship on the tli after much discourage-
ment they reach the porpoise and they have a fitting celebra-
tion in which the doctor is master of ceremonies and helps in
the naming of the surrounding territory but still all is not
well for there is now another electric charge in the air who
will be captaint hatteras or altamont

part ii

            chapter ix
            cold and heat

         atteras and johnson had been getting
somewhat uneasy at the prolonged absence
of their com-
panions and
were delighted
to see them back safe and
sound the hunters were
no less glad to find them-
selves once more in a warm
shelter for the temperature
had fallen considerably as
night drew on and the ther-
mometer outside was far
below zero

 the poor hunters were
half frozen and so worn
out that they could hardly
drag their limbs along but

the stoves were roaring and cracking cheerily and the
big kitchen fire waiting to cook such game as might be
brought in clawbonny donned his official apron again
and soon had his seal cutlets dressed and smoking on
the table by nine oclock the whole party were en-
joying a good supper and
bell couldnt help exclaim-
ing well even at the
risk of being taken for an
esquimau i must confess
eating is the most important
business in these regions
they all had their mouths
crammed too full to speak
but the doctor signified his
agreement with bells views
by an approving nod

the cutlets were pro-
nounced first-rate and it
seemed as if they were for
they were all eaten to the

only a few years ago amundsen and scott in two
separate expeditions reached the south pole much
to the disappointment of scott the norwegian got there
first both hoivever reached the top of the ten thousand
foot mountain on which the south pole lies and planted a
flag there scott died before reaching his ship

  it seems uncanny considering the meagerness of informa-
tion about either the north or the south pole which was
available in vernes time that he should have been able to
foretell almost with exactitude something that was to be
discovered  years later at the south pole

  it is particularly interesting to note that most of what
jules verne said in his concluding chapters almost a hun-
dred years ago has been pretty much proven true of the
south pole recently


he had hardly uttered the words before hatteras by a superhuman effort sprang over the boiling lava and was beyond the

reach of his companions




amazing stories

very last morsel for dessert they had coffee which
the doctor brewed himself in a french coffee-pot over
the alcohol lamp he never allowed anybody else to
concoct this precious beverage for he made a point of
serving it boiling hot always declaring it was not fit to
drink unless it burned his tongue this evening he
took it so scalding that altamont exclaimed

  youll skin your throat

  not a bit of it was the doctors reply

  then your palate must be copper-sheathed said
johnson

  not at all friends i advise you to copy my exam-
ple many persons and i am one can drink coffee at
a temperature of 

   said altamont why that is hotter than the
hand could bear

  of course it is altamont for the hand could not
bear more than  but the palate and tongue are less
sensitive

  you surprise me

  well i will convince you it is fact returned claw-
bonny and taking up a thermometer he plunged it into
the steaming coffee he waited till the mercury rose
as high as  and then withdrew it and swallowed
the liquid with evident gusto

  bell tried to follow his example but burned his
mouth severely

  you are not used to it said the doctor coolly
can you tell us clawbonny asked altamont
what is the highest temperature that the human body
can bear

  yes several curious experiments have been made
in that respect i remember reading of some servant
girls in the town of rochefoucauld in france who
could stay ten minutes in a bakers large oven when
the temperature was  while potatoes and meat
were cooking all around them

  what girls exclaimed altamont

  well there is another case where eight of our own
countrymen-fordyce banks solander blagdin
home nooth lord seaforth and captain phillips-
went into one as hot as  where eggs and beef were
frizzling

  and they were englishmen said bell with a
touch of national pride

  oh the americans could have done better than
that said altamont

  they would have roasted returned the doctor
laughing at all events they have never tried it so
i shall stand up for my countrymen there is one
more instance i recollect and really it is so incredible
that it would be impossible to believe it if it were not
attested by unimpeachable evidence the duke of
ragusa and dr jung a frenchman and an austrian
saw a turk plunge into a bath at 

  but that is not so astonishing as those servant
girls or our own countrymen said johnson

  i beg your pardon replied clawbonny there is
a great difference between plunging into hot air and
hot water hot air produces perspiration which pro-
tects the skin but boiling water scalds the maximum
heat of baths is  so that this turk must have been

an extraordinary fellow to endure such temperature
what is the mean temperature dr clawbonny
of animated beings asked johnson

  that varies with the species replied the doctor
birds have the highest especially the duck and the
hen the mammalia come next and then human be-
ings the temperature of englishmen averages 
i am sure mr altamont is going to claim a higher
jate for his countrymen said johnson smiling

  well sure enough weve some precious hot ones
among us but as i never have put a thermometer
down their throats to ascertain i cant give you sta-
tistics

  there is no sensible difference said the doctor
between men of different races when they are placed
under the same conditions whatever their food may
be i may almost say their temperature would be the
same at the equator as at the pole

  then the heat of our bodies is the same here as in
england replied altamont

  just about it the other species of mammalia are
generally hotter than human beings the horse the
hare the elephant the porpoise and the tiger are
nearly the same but the cat the squirrel the rat the
panther the sheep the ox the dog the monkey and
the goat are as high as  and the pig is 
rather humiliating to us put in altamont

  then come the amphibia and the fish resumed the
doctor whose temperature varies with that of the
water the serpent has a temperature of  the
frog  and the shark several degrees less insects
appear to have the temperature of air and water

  all this is very well interrupted hatteras who
had hitherto taken no part in the conversation and
we are obliged to the doctor for his scientific infor-
mation but we are really talking as if we were going
to brave the heat of the torrid zone i think it would
be far more seasonable to speak of cold if the doctor
could tell us what is the lowest temperature on record 
i can enlighten you on that too replied the doc-
tor there are a great number of memorable winters
which appear to have come at intervals of about forty-
one years in  the rhone was frozen over as far
as arles in  the danube was frozen through-
out its entire extent and the wolves crossed the catte-
gat on firm ground in  the adriatic and the med-
iterranean were frozen at venice and marseilles and
the baltic on the th of april in  all the cattle
died in england from the cold in  the thames
was frozen as far as gravesend and the frightful
winter of  will long be remembered in france
the earliest and longest ever known in the present
century was in  so much for europe

  but here within the polar circle what is the low-
est degree asked altamont

  my word said the doctor i think we have ex-
perienced the lowest ourselves for one day the ther-
mometer was  below zero and if my memory serves
me right the lowest temperature mentioned hitherto by
the arctic voyagers has been  at melville island

 at port felix and  at fort reliance all below
    tf
the desert of ice



  yes said hatteras for it was the unusual se-
verity of the winter that barred our progress for it
came on just at the worst time possible

  you were stopped you say asked altamont
looking fixedly at the captain

  yes in our voyage west the doctor hastened to
reply

  then the maximum and minimum temperatures
said altamont resuming the conversation are about
 apart so you see my friends we may make
ourselves easy

  but if the sun were suddenly extinguished sug-
gested johnson would not the earths temperature be
far lower

  there is no fear of such a catastrophe but even
should it happen the temperature would be scarcely any
different

  thats curious

  it is but fourrier a learned frenchman has proved
the fact incontestably if it were not the case the dif-
ference between day and night would be far greater
as also the degree of cold at the poles but now i
think friends we should be better for a few hours
sleep who has charge of the stove 

  it is my turn to-night said bell

  well pray keep up a good fire for it is a perishing
night

chapter x
winter pleasures

it is a dreary affair to live at the pole for there is
no going out for many long months and nothing
to break the weary monotony

  the day after the hunting excursion was dark and
snowy and clawbonny could find no occupation except
polishing up the ice walls of the hut as they became
damp with the heat inside and emptying out the snow
which drifted into the long passage leading to the
inner door the doctors house stood out well de-
fying storm and tempest and the snow only seemed to
increase the thickness of the walls

  the storehouses too did not give way in the least
but though they were only a few yards off it was found
necessary to lay in enough provisions for the day as
very often the weather made it almost impossible to
venture out

  the unloading of the porpoise turned out to have
been a wise precaution for she was slowly but surely
being crushed to pieces by the silent irresistible pres-
sure around her still the doctor was always hoping
enough planks might be sufficiently sound to construct
a small vessel to convey them back to england but the
right time to build had not yet come

  the five men were consequently compelled to spend
the greater part of the day in complete idleness hat-
teras lolled on his bed absorbed in thought altamont
smoked or dozed and the doctor took care not to dis-
turb either of them for he was in perpetual fear of a
quarrel between them

  at meal times he always led the conversation away
from irritating topics and sought as far as possible
to instruct and interest all parties whenever he was

not engaged with the preparation of his notes he gave
them dissertations on history geography or meteor-
ology handling his subject in an easy though philo-
sophical manner drawing lessons from the most trivial
incidents his inexhaustible memory was never at
a loss for fact or illustration while his good humor
and geniality made him the life and soul of the little
company he was implicitly trusted by all even by
hatteras who cherished a deep affection for him

  yet no man felt the compulsory confinement more
painfully than clawbonny he longed ardently for
the breaking up of the frost to resume his excursions
though he dreaded the rivalry that might ensue be-
tween the two captains

  yet things must come to a crisis soon or late and
meantime he resolved to use his best endeavors to
bring both parties to a better mind but to reconcile
an american and an englishman was no easy task he
and johnson had many a talk on the subject for the
old sailors views quite coincided with his own as to
the difficult complications which awaited them

  however the bad weather continued and leaving
fort providence even for an hour was out of the
question day and night they were pent up in these
glittering icewalls and time hung heavily on their
hands at least on all but the doctors and he always
managed to find some occupation for himself

  i declare said altamont one evening life like
this is not worth having we might as well be some
of those reptiles that sleep all the winter but i sup-
pose there is no help for it

  i am afraid not said the doctor unfortunately
we are too few in number to get up any amusement
then you think if there were more of us we should
find more to do

  of course when whole ships crews have wintered
here they have managed to while away the time
famously

  well i must say i should like to know how it
would need a vast amount of ingenuity to extract any-
thing amusing out of our circumstances i suppose
they did not play at charades 

  no but they introduced the press and the theater
what they had a newspaper exclaimed the
american

  they acted a comedy said bell

  that they did said the doctor when parry
wintered at melville island he started both amuse-
ments among his men and they met with great suc-
cess

  well i must confess i should like to have been
there returned johnson

  curious and amusing too my good johnson lieu-
tenant beechey was the theater manager and captain 
sabina chief editor of the newspaper called the winter
chronicle or the gazette of northern georgia

           chapter xi
           traces of bears

on the th of april during the night there was
a sudden change in the weather the thermom-
eter fell several degrees and the inmates of


amazing stories

doctors house could hardly keep themselves warm
even in their beds altamont had charge of the stove
and he found it needed careful replenishing to preserve
the temperature at  above zero

  this increase of cold betokened the cessation of the
stormy weather and the doctor hailed it gladly as the
harbinger of his favorite hunting and exploring ex-
peditions

  he rose early next morning and climbed up to the
top of the cone the wind had shifted north the air
was clear and the snow was firm and smooth to the
tread

  before long the five companions had left doctors
house and were busily engaged in clearing the heavy
masses of snow off the roof and sides for the house was
no longer distinguishable from the plateau as the
snow had drifted to a depth of full fifteen feet it
took two hours to remove the frozen snow and restore
the architectural form of the dwelling at length the
granite foundations appeared and the storehouses and
powder magazines were once more accessible

  but as in so uncertain a climate a storm might cut
off their supplies any day they wisely resolved to pro-
vide for any such emergency by carrying over a good
stock of provisions to the kitchen and then claw-
bonny altamont and bell started off with their guns
in search of game for the want of fresh food began
to be urgently felt

  the three companions went across the east side of
the cone right down into the center of the far-stretch-
ing snow-covered plain beneath but they did not need
to go far for numerous traces of animals appeared on
all sides within a circle of two miles round fort provi-
dence

  after gazing at these traces for some minutes the
hunters looked at each other silently then the doctor
exclaimed

  well these are plain enough i think

  ay only too plain added bell bears have been
here

  first-rate game said altamont theres only
one fault about it

  and what is that asked bell

  too much of it

  what do you mean

  i mean this-there are distinct traces of five bears
are you sure there are five said clawbonny
look and see for yourself here is one footprint
and there is another quite different these claws are
far wider apart than those and see here again that
paw belongs to a much smaller bear i tell you if you
look carefully you will see the marks of all five dif-
ferent bears distinctly

  youre right said bell after a close inspection
if thats the case then said the doctor we must
take care what were about and not be foolhardy for
these animals are starving after the severe winter and
they might be extremely dangerous to encounter and
since we are sure of their number-

  and of their intentions too put in altamont

  you think they have discovered our presence here
  no doubt of it unless we have got into a bear-pass

 but then why should these footprints be in a circle
 round our fort look these animals have come from
 the southeast and stopped at this place and commenced
 to reconnoiter the coast

   youre right said the doctor and whats more
 it is certain that they have been here last night

   and other nights before that replied altamont

   i dont think so rejoined clawbonny it is more
 likely that they waited till the cessation of the tempest
 and were on their way down to the bay intending to
 catch seals when they scented us

   well we can easily find out if they come to-night
 said altamont

  how

   by effacing all the marks in a given place and if
 to-morrow we find fresh ones it will be evident that
 fort providence is the goal for which the bears are
 bound

   very good at any rate we shall know then what
we have to expect

   the three hunters set to work and scraped the
snow over till all the footprints were obliterated for a
considerable distance

   we shall soon see said altamont

   and meantime we had best go on added the
doctor and keep a sharp look-out

   but not a sign of anything living was visible and
 after a time they returned to the snow-house

   hatteras and johnson were informed how matters
stood and it was resolved to maintain a vigilant watch
night came but nothing disturbed its calm splendor

   next morning at early dawn hatteras and his com-
panions well armed went out to reconnoiter the state
of th snow they found the same identical foot-
marks but somewhat nearer evidently the enemy
was bent on the siege of fort providence

   but where can the bears be said bell

   behind the icebergs watching us replied the doc-
 tor dont let us expose ourselves imprudently
 what about going hunting then asked alta-
 mont

   we must put it off for a day or two i think and
 rub out the marks again and see if they are renewed
 to-morrow

   the doctors advice was followed and they en-
trenched themselves for the present in the fort the
lighthouse was taken down as it was not-of actual use
meantime and might help to attract the bears each
took it in turn to keep watch on the upper plateau

   the day passed without a sign of the enemys ex-
istence and next morning when they hurried eagerly
out to examine the snow judge their astonishment to
find it wholly untouched

   capital exclaimed altamont the bears are put
off the scent they have no perseverance and have
grown tired waiting for us they are off and a good
riddance

   softly softly said the doctor i am not so sure
 they have gone i think we had better wait one day
 more it is evident the bears have not been here last
 night at least on this side but still-

   well let us go right round the plateau and see how
the desert of ice



things stand said the always impatient altamont
all right said clawbonny come along
away they went but it was impossible to scrutinize
carefully a track of two miles no trace of the enemy
was discoverable

  now then cant we go hunting said altamont
  wait till to-morrow urged the doctor again

  his friend was very unwilling to delay but yielded
the point at last and returned to the fort

  as on the preceding night each man took his hours
watch on the upper plateau when it came to alta-
monts turn and he had gone out to relieve bell hat-
teras called his old companion round him the doc-
tor left his desk and johnson his cooking and hastened
to their captains side supposing he wanted to talk over
their perilous situation but hatteras never gave it a
thought

  my friends he said let us take advantage of the
americans absence to speak of business there are
things which cannot concern him and with which i do
not wish him to meddle

  johnson and clawbonny looked at each other won-
dering what the captain was driving at

  i wish he continued to talk with you about our
plans for the future

  all right talk away said the doctor

  in a month or six weeks at the outside the time
for making distant excursions will come again have
you thought of what we had better undertake in
summer 

  have you captain asked johnson

  have i i may say that not an hour of my life
passes without revolving in my mind my one cherished
purpose i suppose not a man among you intends to re-
trace his steps

  no one replied and hatteras went on to say

  for my own part even if i must go alone i will
push on to the north pole never were men so near
it before for we are not more than  miles distant
at most and i will not lose such an opportunity with-
out making every attempt to reach it even though it
be an impossibility what are your views doctor
your own hatteras

  and yours johnson

  like the doctors

  and yours bell

  captain replied the carpenter it is true we have
neither wives nor children waiting us in england but
after all it is ones country-ones native land have
you no thoughts of returning home

  we can return after we have discovered the pole
quite as well as before and even better our diffi-
culties will not increase for as we near the pole we
get away from the point of greatest cold we have
fuel and provisions enough there is nothing to stop
us and we should be culpable in my opinion if we
allowed ourselves to abandon the project

  very well captain ill go along with you
thats right i never doubted you said hatteras
we shall succeed and england will have all the
glory

  but there is an american with us said johnson

 hatteras could not repress an impatient exclamation
 i know it he said in a stern voice

 we cannot leave him behind added the doctor
 no we cant repeated hatteras almost mechan-
 ically

 and he will be sure to go too

 yes he will go too but who will command

 you captain

 and if you all obey my orders will the yankee re-
 fuse

 i shouldnt think so but suppose he should
 he and i must fight it out then

 the three englishment looked at hatteras but said
 nothing then the doctor aske how he proposed they
 should go

 by the coast as far as possible was the reply
 but what if we find open water as is likely enough 
 well well go across it

 but we have no boat

 hatteras did not answer and looked very much
 embarrassed

 perhaps suggested bell we might make a boat
 out of some of the planks of the porpoise
 never exclaimed hatteras vehemently

 never said johnson

 the doctor shook his head he understood the feel-
 ing of the captain

 never reiterated hatteras a boat made out
 of an american ship would be an american

 but captain- began johnson

 the doctor made a sign to the old boatswain not to
 press the subject further and resolved in his own mind
 to reserve the question for discussion at a more op-
 portune moment he managed to turn the conversation
 to other matters till it abruptly terminated by the en-
 trance of altamont

 this ended the day and the night passed quietly
 without the least disturbance the bears had evi-
 dently disappeared

chapter xii
imprisoned in doctors house

 the first business next day was to arrange for a
 hunt it was settled that altamont bell and
 hatteras should form the party while clawbonny
 should go and explore as far as johnson island and
 make some hydrographic notes and johnson should
 remain behind to keep house

 the three hunters soon completed their preparations
 they armed themselves each with a double-barreled
 pistol and a rifle and took plenty of powder and bullets
 each man also carried- in his belt his indispensable
 snow knife and hatchet and a small supply of pem-
 mican in case night should surprise them before their
 return

 thus equipped they could go far and might count
 on a good supply of game

 at eight oclock they started accompanied by duk
 who frisked and gamboled with delight they went
 up the hill to the east across the cone and down into
 the plain below


amazing stories

  the doctor next took his departure after agreeing
with johnson on a signal of alarm in case of danger

  the old boatswain was left alone but he had plenty
to do he began by unfastening the greenland dogs
and letting them out for a run after their long weari-
some confinement then he attended to divers house-
keeping matters he had to replenish the stock of
combustibles and provisions to arrange the store-houses
to mend several broken utensils to repair the rents in
coverlets and get new shoes ready for summer excur-
sions there was no lack of work and the old sailors
nimble clever fingers could do anything

  while his hands were busy his mind was occupied
with the conversation of the preceding evening he
pondered with regret over the captains obstinacy and
yet he felt that there was something grand and even
heroic in his determination that neither an american
nor an american ship should first touch the pole

  the hunters had gone about an hour when johnson
suddenly heard the report of a gun

  capital he exclaimed they have found some-
thing and pretty quickly too if we can hear their
guns so distinctly the atmosphere must be very
clear

  a second and a third shot followed

  bravo again exclaimed the boatswain they must
have fallen in lucks way

  but when three more shots came in rapid succession
the old man turned pale and a horrible thought crossed
his mind which made him rush out and climb hastily to
the top of the cone he shuddered at the sight which
met his eyes the three hunters followed by duk
were tearing home at full speed followed by the five
huge bears their six balls had evidently taken no
effect and the terrible monsters were close on their
heels hatteras who brought up the rear could only
manage to keep off his pursuers by flinging down one
article after another-first his cap then his hatchet and
finally his gun he knew that the inquisitive bears
would stop and examine every object sniffing all round
it and this gave him a little time otherwise he could
not have escaped for these animals outstrip the fleetest
horse and one monster was so near that hatteras had
to brandish his knife vigorously to ward off a tre-
mendous blow of his paw

  at last though panting and out of breath the three
men reached johnson safely and slid down the rock
with him into the snow-house the bears stopped
short on the upper plateau and hatteras and his com-
panions lost no time in barring and barricading them
out

  here we are at last exclaimed hatteras we can
defend ourselves better now it is five against five

  four said johnson in a frightened voice

 how

  the doctor replied johnson pointing to the empty
sitting-room he is on johnsons island

  a bad job for him said bell

  but we cant leave him to his fate in this fashion
said altamont

  no lets be off to find him at once replied hat-
teras he opened the door but soon shut it narrowly

escaping a bears hug they are there he exclaimed 

  all asked bell

  the whole pack

  altamont rushed to the windows and began to fill
up the deep embrasure with blocks of ice which he
broke off the walls of the house

  his companions followed his example silently not
a sound was heard but the low deep growl of duk

  to tell the simple truth however it was not their
own danger that occupied their thoughts but that of
their absent friend the doctor it was for him they
trembled not for themselves poor clawbonny so
good and devoted as he had been to every member of
the little colony this was the first time they had
been separated from him extreme peril and most
likely a frightful death awaited him for he might
return unsuspectingly to fort providence and find
himself in the power of these ferocious animals

  and yet said johnson unless i am much mis-
taken he must be on guard your repeated shots can-
not but have warned him he must surely be aware
that something unusual has happened

  but suppose he was too far away to hear them
replied altamont or has not understood the cause
of them it is ten chances to one but hell come
quickly back never imagining the danger the bears
are screened from sight by the crag completely

  we must get rid of them before he comes said
hatteras

  but how asked bell

  it was difficult to reply to this for a sortie was out
of the question they had taken care to barricade the
entrance passage but the bears could easily find a
way in if they chose so it was thought advisable to
keep a close watch on their movements outside by
listening attentively in each room so as to be able to
resist all attempts at invasion they could distinctly
hear them prowling about growling and scraping the
walls with their enormous paws

  however some action must be taken speedily for
time was passing altamont resolved to try a port-hole
through which he might fire on his assailants he had
soon scooped out a hole in the wall but his gun was
hardly pushed through when it was seized with irre-
sistible force and wrested from his grasp before he
could even fire

  confound it he exclaimed were no match for
them

  this state of things had lasted upwards of an hour
and there seemed no prospect of a termination the
question of a sortie began now to be seriously discussed
there was little chance of success as the bears could
not be attacked separately but hatteras and his com-
panions had grown so impatient and it must be con-
fessed were also so much ashamed of being kept in
prison by beasts that they would even have dared the
risk if the captain had not suddenly thought of a new
mode of defense

  he took johnsons furnace-poker and thrust it into
the stove while he made an opening in the snow wall
or rather a partial opening for he left a thin sheet of
ice on the outer side as soon as the poker was red-hot
the desert of ice



 he said to his comrades who stood eagerly watching
 him wondering what he was going to do

 this red-hot bar will keep off the bears when they
 try to get hold of it and we shall be able easily to fire
 across it without letting them snatch away our guns
 a good idea said bell posting himself beside al-
 tamont

 hatteras withdrew the poker and instantly plunged
 it in the wall the melting snow made a loud hissing
 noise and two bears ran and made a snatch at the glow-
 ing bar but they fell back with a terrible howl and at
 the same moment four shots resounded one after the
 other

 hit exclaimed altamont

 hit echoed bell

 let us repeat the dose said hatteras carefully
 stopping up the opening meantime

 the poker was again thrust into the fire and in a
 few minutes was ready for hatteras to recommence op-
 erations

 altamont and bell reloaded their guns and took their
  places but this time the poker would not pass through

 confound the beasts exclaimed the impetuous
 american

 whats the matter asked johnson

 whats the matter why those plaguey animals
 are piling up block after block intending to bury us
 alive

 impossible

 look for yourself the poker cant get through i
 declare it is getting absurd now

 it was worse than absurd it was alarming things
 grew worse it was evident that the bears meant to
 stifle their prey for the sagacious animals were heap-
 ing up huge masses which would make escape impos-
 sible

 it is too bad said old johnson with a mortified
 look one might put up with men but bears

 two hours elapsed without bringing any relief to
 the prisoners to go out was impossible and the thick
 walls excluded all sound altamont walked impatiently
 up and down full of exasperation and excitement at
 finding himself worsted for once hatteras could
 think of nothing but the doctor and of the serious peril
 which threatened him

 oh if dr clawbonny were only here said john-
 son

 what could he do asked altamont

 oh hed manage to get us out somehow

 how pray said the american crossly

 if i knew that i should not need him however
 i know what his advice just now would be

 what

 to take some food that cant hurt us what do
 you say mr altamont

 oh lets eat by all means if that will please you
 though were in a ridiculous not to say humiliating
 plight

 ill bet you well find a way out after dinner
 no one replied but they seated themselves round
 the table johnson trained in clawbonnys school
 tried to be brave and unconcerned about the danger but

 he could scarcely manage it his jokes stuck in his
 throat moreover the whole party began to feel un-
 comfortable the atmosphere was getting dense for
 every opening was hermetically sealed the stoves
 would hardly draw and it was evident they would soon
 go out altogether for want of oxygen

 hatteras was the first to see their fresh danger and
 he made no attempt to hide it from his companions

 if that is the case said altamont we must get
 out at all risks

 yes replied hatteras but let us wait till night
 we will make a hole in the roof and let in a provision
 of air and then one of us can fire out of it on the
 bears

it is the only thing we can do i suppose said
altamont

so it was agreed but waiting was hard work and
altamont could not refrain from giving vent to his im-
patience by thundering maledictions on the bears and
abusing the ill fate which had placed them in such an
awkward and humbling predicament it was beasts
versus men he said and certainly the men cut a
pretty figure

chapter xiii
the mine

night drew on and the lamp in the sitting-
room already began to burn dim for want of
oxygen at eight oclock the final arrangements
were completed and all that remained to do was to
make an opening in the roof

they had been working away at this for some min-
utes and bell was showing himself quite an adept at the
business when johnson who had been keeping watch
in the sleeping room came hurriedly in to his com-
panions pulling such a long face that the captain
asked immediately what was the matter

 nothing exactly said the old sailor and yet-

come out with it exclaimed altamont

hush dont you hear a peculiar noise

where

 here on this side on the wall of the room

 bell stopped working and listened attentively like
 the rest johnson was right a noise there certainly
 was on the side wall as if someone were cutting the
 ice

 dont you hear it repeated johnson

hear it yes plain enough replied altamont

 is it the bears asked bell

 most assuredly

well they have changed their tactics said old
johnson and given up the idea of suffocating us

or maybe they suppose we are suffocated by now
suggested the american getting furious at his invis-
ible enemies

 they are going to attack us said bell

 well what of it returned hatteras

 we shall have a hand-to-hand struggle thats all

and so much the better added altamont thats
far more to my taste i have had enough of invisible
foes-let me see my antagonist and i can fight him


amazing stories

  ay said johnson but not with guns they
would be useless here

  with knife and hatchet then returned the ameri-
can

  the noise increased and it was evident that the point
of attack was the angle of the wall formed by its junc-
tion with the cliff

  they are hardly six feet off now said the boats-
wain

  right johnson replied altamont but we have
time enough to be ready for them

  and seizing a hatchet he placed himself in fighting
attitude planting his right foot firmly forward and
throwing himself back

  hatteras and the others followed his example and
johnson took care to load a gun in case of necessity

  every minute the sound came nearer till at last
only a thin coating separated them from their assail-
ants

  presently this gave way with a loud crack and a
huge dark mass rolled over into the room

  altamont had already swung his hatchet to strike
when he was arrested by a well-known voice exclaim-
ing

  for heavens sake stop

  the doctor the doctor cried johnson

  and the doctor it actually was who had tumbled in
among them in such undignified fashion

  how do ye do good friends he said picking
himself smartly up

  his companions stood stupefied for a moment but
joy soon loosened their tongues and each rushed
eagerly forward to welcome his old comrade with a
loving embrace hatteras was for once fairly over-
come with emotion and positively hugged him like a
child

  and is it really you dr clawbonny said john-
son

  myself and nobody else my old fellow i assure
you i have been far more uneasy about you than you
could have been about me

  but how did you know we had been attacked by
a troop of bears asked altamont what we were
most afraid of was that you would quickly come back
to fort providence never dreaming of the danger you
were rushing into

  oh i saw it all your repeated shots gave me
the alarm when you commenced firing i was beside
the wreck of the porpoise but i climbed up a hum-
mock and discovered five bears close on your heels
oh how anxious i was for you but when i saw
you disappear down the cliff while the bears stood
hesitating on the edge as if uncertain what to do i
felt sure that you had managed to get safely inside
the house and barricade it i crept cautiously nearer
sometimes going on all-fours sometimes slipping be-
tween great blocks of ice till i came at last quite close
to our fort and then i found the bears working away
like beavers they were prowling about the snow
and dragging enormous blocks of ice towards the house
piling them up like a wall evidently intending to bury
you alive it is a lucky thing they did not take it into

their heads to dash down the blocks from the summit
of the cone for then you must have been crushed in-
evitably

  but what danger you were in dr clawbonny
said bell any moment they might have turned round
and attacked you

  they never thought of it even johnsons green-
land dogs came in sight several times but they did
not take the trouble to go after them no they imag-
ined themselves sure of a more savory supper
thanks for the compliment said altamont laugh-
ing

  oh there is nothing to be proud of when i saw
what the bears were up to i determined to get back
to you by some means or other i waited till night
but as soon as it got dark i glided noiselessly along
towards the powder-magazine i had reasons for
choosing that point from which to work my way hither
and i speedily commenced operations with my snow-
knife a famous tool it is for three mortal hours
i have been hacking and heaving away but here i am
at last tired enough and starving but still safe here
to share our fate said altamont

  no to save you all but for mercys sake give me
a biscuit and a bit of meat for i am sinking for want
of food

a substantial meal was soon before him but
the vivacious little man could talk all the while
he was eating and was quite ready to answer any ques-
tions

  did you say to save us asked bell

  most assuredly was the reply

  well certainly if you found your way in we
can find our way out by the same road

  a likely story and leave the field clear for the
whole pack to come in and find out our stores pretty
havoc they would make

  no we must stay here said hatteras

  of course we must replied clawbonny but well
get rid of the bears for all that

  i told you so said johnson rubbing his hand
i knew that nothing was hopeless if dr clawbonny
was here he has always some expedient in his wise
head

  my poor head is very empty i fear but by dint of

rummaging perhaps i-

  doctor interrupted altamont i suppose there is
no fear of the bears getting in by the passage you have
made

  no i took care to stop up the opening thoroughly
and now we can reach the powder-magazine without
letting them see us

  all right and now will you let us have your plan
of getting rid of these comical assailants

  my plan is quite simple and part of the work is
done already

  what do you mean 

  you shall see but i am forgetting that i brought
a companion with me

  what do you say said johnson

  i have a companion to introduce to you replied
the desert of ice



the doctor going out again into the passage and bring-
ing back a dead fox newly killed

  i shot it this morning and never did fox come
more opportunely

  what on earth do you mean  asked altamont

  i mean to blow up the bears cn masse with 
pounds of powder

  but where is the powder exclaimed his friends
in the magazine this passage will lead to it i
made it purposely

  and where is the mine to be inquired altamont
at the farthest point from the house and stores
and how will you manage to entice the bears there
all to one spot

  ill undertake that business but we have talked
enough let us set to work we have a hundred feet
more to add to our passage to-night and that is no
easy matter but as there are five of us we can take
turns at it bell will begin and we will lie down and
sleep meantime

  well really said johnson the more i think of
it the more feasible seems the doctors plan

  it is a sure one anyway said clawbonny

  so sure that i can feel the bears fur already on
my shoulder well come lets begin then

  away he went into the gloomy passage followed
by bell and in a few moments they had reached the
powder-magazine and stood among the well-arranged
barrels the doctor pointed out to his companion the
exact spot where he began excavating and then left
him to his task at which he labored diligently for
about an hour when altamont came to relieve him
all the snow he had dug out was taken to the kitchen
and melted to prevent its taking up room

  the captain succeeded altamont and was followed
by johnson in ten hours-that is to say about eigfit
in the morning-the gallery was entirely open

  with the first streak of day the doctor was up to
reconnoiter the position of the enemy the patient ani-
mals were still occupying their old position prowling
up and down and growling the house had already
almost disappeared beneath the piled-up blocks of ice
but even while he gazed they seemed to have deter-
mined to alter the plan of action for suddenly all the
five bears vigorously began to pull down these same
heaped-up blocks

  what are they about asked hatteras

  well they seem to me to be bent on demolishing
their own work and getting right down to us as fast
as possible but wait a bit my gentlemen well de-
molish you first

  hastening away to the mine he had the chamber
where the powder was to be lodged enlarged the whole
breadth and height of the sloping rock against which
the wall leaned till the upper part was about a foot
thick and had to be propped up to prevent its falling
in a strong stake was fixed firmly on the granite
foundation on the top of which the dead fox was fas-
tened a rope was attached to the lower part of the
stake sufficiently long to reach the powder stores

  this is the bait he said pointing to the dead
fox and here is the mine he added slowly rolling

in a keg of powder containing about  pounds

  but doctor said hatteras wont that blow us
up too as well as the bears

no we shall be too far from the scene of explo-
sion besides our house is solid and we can soon
repair the walls even if they should get a bit shaken
and how do you propose to manage asked alta-
mont

  by hauling in this rope we lower the post which
props up the roof and make it give way and bring up
the dead fox to light i think you will agree with me
that the bears are so famished with their long fasting
that they wont lose much time in rushing towards their
unexpected meal well just at that very moment i
shall set fire to the mine and blow up both the guests
and the meal

  capital capital shouted johnson who had been
listening with intense interest

  hatteras said nothing for he had such absolute con-
fidence in his friend that he wanted no further explana-
tion but altamont must know the why and wherefore
of everything

  but doctor he said can you reckon on your
match so exactly that you can be quite sure it will fire
the mine at the right moment

  i dont need to reckon at all

  then you have a match a hundred feet long
  no

  you are simply going to lay a train of powder
  no that might miss fire

  well there is no way then but for one of us to
devote his life to the others and go and light the pow-
der himself

  im ready said johnson eagerly ready and will-
ing

  quite useless my brave fellow replied the doc-
tor holding out his hand all our lives are precious
and they will all be spared thank god

  well i give it up said the american ill make
no more guesses

  i should like to know what is the good of learning
physics said the doctor smiling if it cant help
a man in a pinch like this havent we an electric
battery and wires long enough attached to it to serve
our purpose we can fire our mine at any instant
and without the slightest danger

  hurrah exclaimed johnson

  hurrah echoed the others without heeding
whether the enemy heard them or not

  the doctors idea was immediately carried out and
the connected lines uncoiled and laid down from the
house to the chamber of the mine one end of each
remaining attached to the electric battery and the other
inserted into the keg of powder

  by nine oclock everything was ready it was high
time for the bears were furiously engaged in the work
of demolition johnson was stationed in the powder-
magaine in charge of the cord which held the bait

  now said clawbonny to his companions load
your guns in case our assailants are not killed stand
beside johnson and the moment the explosion is over
rush out


amazing stories

  all right said altamont

  and now we have done all we can to help our-
selves so may heaven help us

  hatteras altamont and bell repaired to the powder-
magazine while the doctor remained alone beside the
pile soon he heard johnsons voice in the distance
calling out ready

  all right was the reply

  johnson pulled his rope vigorously and then rushed
to the loophole to see the effect the thin shell of ice
had given way and the body of the fox lay among
the ruins the bears were somewhat scared at first
but the next minute had eagerly rushed to seize the
booty

  fire called out johnson and at once the electric
spark was sent along the lines right into the keg of
powder a formidable explosion ensued the house
was shaken as if by an earthquake and the walls
cracked asunder hatteras altamont and bell hur-
ried out with the guns but they might spare their shot
for four of the bears lay dead and the fifth half
roasted though alive was scampering away in terror
as fast as his legs could-carry him

  hurrah three cheers for clawbonny they
shouted and overwhelmed the doctor with plaudits
and thanks

           chapter xiv
           an arctic spring

the prisoners were free and their joy found
vent in the noisiest demonstrations they em-
ployed the rest of the day in repairing the house
which had suffered greatly by the explosion

  next morning there was a singular rise in the tem-
perature the thermometer going up to  above zero
this comparative heat lasted several days in shel-
tered spots the glass rose as high as  and symptoms
of a coming thaw appeared the ice began to crack
here and there and jets of salt water were thrown up
like fountains in an english park a few days later
the rain fell in torrents

  thick vapor rose from the snow giving promise of
the speedy disappearance of these immense masses
the suns pale disk became deeper in color and re-
mained longer above the horizon the night was
scarcely longer than three hours other tokens of
springs approach became manifest the birds were
returning in flocks and the air resounded with their
deafening cries hares were seen on the shores of
the bay and mice were in such abundance that their
burrows completely honeycombed the ground

  the doctor drew the attention of his companions
to the fact that almost all these animals were begin-
ning to lose their white winter dress and would soon
put on summer attire and nature was already provid-
ing mosses and poppies and saxifrage and short
grass for their sustenance a new world lay beneath
that melting snow

  but with their inoffensive animals came back their
natural enemies foxes and wolves arrived in search
of their prey and dismal howls broke the silence of the
short night

  arctic wolves closely resemble dogs and their bark-
ing would deceive the most practiced ears even the
canine race themselves have been deceived by it in-
deed it seems as if the wily animals employed this
ruse to attract the dogs and make them their prey
several navigators have mentioned the fact and the
doctors own experience confirmed it johnson took
care not to let his greenlanders loose of duk there
was little fear-nothing could take him in

  for about a fortnight hunting was the principal
occupation there was an abundant supply of fresh
meat to be had they shot partridges ptarmigans and
snow ortolans which are delicious eating the hunt-
ers never went far from fort providence for game
was so plentiful that it seemed awaiting their guns
and the whole bay presented an animated appearance

  the thaw meanwhile was making rapid progress
the thermometer stood steadily at  above zero and
the water ran round the mountain-sides in cataracts
and dashed in torrents through the ravines

  the doctor lost no time in clearing about an acre
of ground in which he sowed the seeds of anti-scor-
butic plants he just had the pleasure of seeing tiny
little green leaves begin to sprout when the cold re-
turned in full force

  in a single night the thermometer lost nearly  it
went down to  below zero everything was frozen
birds quadrupeds amphibia disappeared as if by magic
seal-holes re-closed and the ice once more became hard
as granite

  the change was most striking it occurred on the
th of may during the night the doctor was
rather disappointed at having all his work to do again
but hatteras bore the grievance most unphilosophically
as it interfered with all his plans of speedy departure

  do you think we shall have a long spell of this
weather dr clawbonny asked johnson

  no my friend i dont it is a last blow from the
cold you see these are his dominions and he wont
be driven out without making some resistance

  he can defend himself pretty well said bell rub-
bing his face

  yes but i ought to have waited and not have
wasted my seed like an ignoramus and all the more
as i could if necessary have made them sprout by
the kitchen stoves

  but do you mean to say asked altamont that
you might have anticipated the sudden change

  of course and without being a wizard i ought
to have put my seed under the protection of saint
paucratius and the two other saints whose fete days
fall this month

  the doctor was right for the cold lasted till the
end of the month and put an end to all their hunting
expeditions the old monotonous life indoors recom-
menced and was unmarked by any incident except a
serious illness which suddenly attacked bell this was
violent quinsy but under the doctors skillful treat-
ment it was soon cured

  during this compulsory leisure clawbonny deter-
mined to have a talk with the captain on an important
subject-a subject equally important to all-the build-
the desert of ice



ing of a boat out of the planks of the porpoise

  the doctor hardly knew how to begin as hatteras
had declared so vehemently that he would never con-
sent to use a morsel of american wood yet it was high
time he were brought to reason as june was at hand
the only season for distant expeditions and they could
not start without a boat

  he thought over it a long while and at last drew
the captain aside and said in the kindest gentlest
way

  hatteras do you believe im your friend

   most certainly i do replied the captain earnestly
my best indeed my only friend

  and if i give you a piece of advice without your
asking will you consider my motive is perfectly dis-
interested 

  yes for i know you have never been actuated by
self-interest but what are you driving at

  wait hatteras i have one thing more to ask
do you look on me as a true-hearted englishman like
yourself anxious for his countrys glory

   hatteras looked surprised but simply said

   i do

ou desire to reach the north pole the doc-
 tor went on and i understand and share your
ambition but to achieve your object you must employ
the right means

   well and have i not sacrificed everything for it
hatteras asked

   no hatteras you have not sacrificed your personal
antipathies even at this very moment i know you
are in the mood to refuse the indispensable conditions
of reaching the pole

   ah it is the boat you want to talk about and that
man-

  hatteras let us discuss the question calmly and
examine the case on all sides the coast on which we
find ourselves at present may terminate abruptly we
have no proof that it stretches right away to the pole
indeed if your present information proves correct we
ought to come to an open sea during the summer
months

  well supposing we reach this arctic ocean and
find it free from ice and easy to navigate what shall
we do if we have no boat

   hatteras made no reply

   tell me now would you like to find yourself only
a few miles from the pole and not be able to get to
it

   hatteras still said nothing but buried his head in
his hands

   besides continued the doctor look at the ques-
tion in its moral aspect here is an englishman who
sacrifices his fortune and even his life to win fresh
glory for his country but because the boat which bears
him across an unknown ocean or touches the new
shore happens to be made of the planks of an ameri-
can vessel-a castaway wreck of no use to anyone-
will that lessen the honor of the discovery if you
yourself had found the hull of some wrecked vessel
lying deserted on the shore would you have hesitated

to make use of it and must not a sloop built by four
englishmen and manned by four englishmen be eng-
lish from keel to gunwale

   hatteras was still silent

  no continued clawbonny the real truth is it
is not the sloop you care about it is the man
yes doctor yes replied the captain it is this
american i detest i hate him with a thorough english
hatred fate has thrown him in my path

  to save you

  to ruin me he seems to defy me and speaks as
if he were lord and master he thinks he has my des-
tiny in his hands and knows all my projects didnt
we see the man in his true colors when we were giving
names to the different coasts  has he ever avowed his
object in coming so far north you will never get it
out of my head that this man is not the leader of some
expedition sent out by the american government
well hatteras suppose it is so does it follow that
his expedition is to search for the north pole may
it not be to find the northwest passage but anyway
altamont is in complete ignorance of our object for
neither johnson nor bell nor myself have ever
breathed a word to him about it and i am sure you
have not

  well let him always remain so

  he must be told in the end for we cant leave him
here alone

  why not cant he stay here in fort providence
he would never consent to that hatteras and
moreover to leave a man in that way and not know
whether we might find him safe when we come back
would be worse than imprudent it would be inhuman
altamont will come with us he must come but we
need not disclose our projects let us tell him nothing
but simply build a sloop for the ostensible purpose of
making a survey of the coast it seems to me it should
prove to be a simple matter

  hatteras could not bring himself to consent but
said

  suppose the man doesnt allow his ship to be cut
up

  in that case you must take the law into your own
hands and build a vessel in spite of him there would
be nothing else to do

  i wish to goodness he would refuse then

  he must be asked before he can refuse ill un-
dertake the asking said clawbonny

  he kept his word for that very same night at sup-
per he managed to turn the conversation towards the
subject of making excursions during summer for hy-
drographical purposes

  you will join us i suppose altamont he said
of course replied the american we must know
how far new america extends

hatteras looked fixedly at his rival but said nothing
and for that purpose continued altamont we
had better build a little ship out of the remains of the
porpoise it is the best possible use we can make of
her

  you hear bell said the doctor eagerly well
all set to work to-morrow morning

chapter xv
the northwest passage

next morning altamont bell and the doctor
repaired to the porpoise there was no lack of
wood for shattered as the old three-master
had been by the icebergs she could still supply the
principal parts of a new ship and the carpenter began
his task immediately

  in the end of may the temperature again rose and
spring returned for good and all rain fell copiously
and before long the melting snow was running down
every little slope in falls and cascades

  hatteras could not contain his delight at these signs
of a general thaw among the ice-fields for an open sea
would bring him liberty at last he might hope to
ascertain for himself whether his predecessors were
correct in their assertions about a polar basin

  this was a frequent topic of thought and conver-
sation with him and one evening when he was going
over all the old familiar arguments in support of his
theory altamont took up the subject and declared his
opinion that the polar basin extended west as well as
east but it was impossible for the american and
the einglishman to talk long about anything without
coming to words so intensely national were both dr
kane was the first bone of contention on this oc-
casion for the jealous englishman was unwilling to
grant his rival the glory of being a discoverer alleging
his belief that though the brave adventurer had gone
far north it was by mere chance he had made a dis-
covery

  chance interrupted altamont hotly do you
mean to assert that it is not to kanes energy and
science that we owe his great discovery 

  i mean to say that dr kanes name is not worth
mentioning in a country made illustrious by such names
as parry and franklin and ross and belcher and
penny in a country where the seas opened the north-
west passage to an englishman-mcclure

  mcclure exclaimed the american well if
ever chance favored anyone it was that mcclure do
you pretend to deny it

  i do said hatteras becoming quite excited it
was his courage and perseverance in remaining four
whole winters among the ice

  i believe that dont i said altamont sneeringly
he was caught among the bergs and could not get
away but didnt he after all abandon his ship the in-
vestigator and try to get back home besides putting
the man aside what is the value of his discovery i
maintain that the northwest passage is still undis-
covered for not a single ship to this day has ever
sailed from bering strait to baffin bay

  the fact was indisputable but hatteras started to his
feet and said

  i will not permit the honor of an english captain
to be attacked in my presence any longer

  you will not permit echoed altamont also spring-
ing erect but these are facts and it is out of your
power to destroy them

  sir shouted hatteras pale with rage

  my friends interposed the doctor pray be
calm this is a scientific point that we are discussing
but hatteras was deaf to reason now and said
angrily

  ill tell you the facts sir

and ill tell you retorted the irate american
gentlemen said clawbonny in a firm tone al-
low me to speak for i know the facts of the case as
well as and perhaps better than you and i can state
them impartially

  yes yes cried bell and johnson who had been
anxiously watching the strife

  well go on said altamont finding himself in the
minority while hatteras simply made a sign of acqui-
escence and resumed his seat

  the doctor brought a chart and spread it out on the
table that his auditors might follow his narration in-
telligibly and be able to judge the merits of mcclure for
themselves

  it was in  he said that two vessels the
herald and the plover were sent out in search of
franklin but their efforts proving ineffectual two
others were despatched to assist them-the investi-
gator in command of mcclure and the enterprise
in command of captain collinson the investigator
arrived first in bering strait and without waiting
for her consort set out with the declared purpose to
find franklin or the northwest passage the gal-
lant young officer hoped to push north as far as mel-
ville sound but just at the extremity of the strait
he was stopped by an insurmountable barrier of ice
and forced to winter there during the long dreary
months however he and his officers undertook a
journey over the ice-field to make sure of its com-
municating with melville sound

  yes but he did not get through said altamont
stop a bit replied clawbonny as soon as a thaw
set in mcclure renewed his attempt to bring his ship
into melville sound and had succeeded in getting
within twenty miles when contrary winds set in and
dragged her south with irresistible violence this de-
cided the captain to alter his course he determined to
go in a westerly direction but after a fearful struggle
with icebergs he stuck fast in the first of the series of
straits which end in baffin bay and was obliged to win-
ter in mercy bay his provisions would only hold out
eighteen months longer but he would not give up he
set out on a sled and reached melville island hop-
ing to fall in with some ship or other but all he found
in winter harbor was a cairn which contained a docu-
ment stating that captain austins lieutenant mcclin-
tock had been there the preceding year mcclure re-
placed this document by another which stated his in-
tention of returning to england by the northwest pas-
sage he had discovered by lancaster sound and baffin
bay and that in the event of his not being heard of he
might be looked for north or west of melville island
then he went back to mercy bay with undaunted cour-
age to pass a third winter by the beginning of march
his stock of provisions was so reduced in consequence
of the utter scarcity of game through the severity of
the season that mcclure resolved to send half his men
the desert of ice



to england either by baffin bay or by mckenzie
river and hudson bay the other half would manage
to work the vessel to europe he kept all his best
sailors and selected for departure only those to whom
a fourth winter would have been fatal everything was
arranged for their leaving and the day fixed when
mcclure who was out walking with lieutenant cras-
well observed a man running towards them flinging up
his arms and gesticulating frantically and on getting
nearer recognized him as lieutenant prim officer on
board the herald one of the ships he had parted with
in bering strait two years before captain kellett
the commander had reached winter harbor and find-
ing mcclures document in the cairn had dispatched his
lieutenant in search of him mcclure accompanied
him back and arranged with the captain to send him his
batch of invalids lieutenant craswell took charge
of these and conveyed them safely to winter harbor
leaving them there he went across the ice four hun-
dred and seventy miles and arrived at beechey island
where a few days afterwards he took passage with
twelve men on board the phoenix and reached london
safely on the th of october  having traversed
the whole extent between bering strait and cape
farewell

  well if arriving on one side and leaving at the
other is not going through i dont know what is
yes but he went four hundred and seventy miles
over ice-fields objected altamont

  what of that

  everything that is the gist of the whole argument
it was not the investigator that went through

  no replied clawbonny for at the close or the
fourth winter mcclure was obliged to leave her among
the ice

  well in maritime expeditions the vessel has to get
through and not the man and if ever the northwest
passage is practicable it will be for ships and not
sledges if a ship cannot go a sloop must

  a sloop exclaimed hatteras discovering a hidden
meaning in the words

  altamont said the doctor your distinction is
simply puerile and in that respect we all consider that
you are in the wrong

  you may easily do that returned the american
it is four against one but that will not prevent me
from holding my own opinion

  keep it and welcome but keep it to yourself if
you please for the future exclaimed hatteras

  and pray what right have you to speak to me like
this sir shouted altamont in a fury

  my right as captain returned hatteras equally
angry

  am i to submit to your orders then

  most assuredly and woe to you if-

  the doctor did not allow him to proceed for he
really feared the two antagonists might come to blows
bell and johnson seconded his endeavors to make
peace and after a few conciliatory words altamont
turned on his heel and walked carelessly away whis-
tling yankee doodle hatteras went outside and
paced up and down with rapid strides in about an

hour he came back and retired to bed without saying
another word

            chapter xvi
            arctic arcadia

on the th of may for the first time the sun
never set his glowing disk just touched the
boundary line of the horizon and rose again
immediately the period was now entered when the
day lasts twenty-four hours

  next morning there was a magnificent halo the
monarch of day appeared surrounded by a luminous
circle radiant with all the prismatic colors this
phenomenon never lost its charm for the doctor how-
ever frequently it occurred and he always noted care-
fully all particulars respecting it

  before long the feathered tribes began to return
filling the air with their discordant cries the doctor
shot several and among them one or two cranes and
a solitary stork

  the snow was now fast melting and the ice-fields
were covered with slush all round the bay large
pools had formed between which the soil appeared as
if it was some product of spring

  the doctor recommenced his sowing for he had
plenty of seed but he was surprised to find sorrel
growing already between the half-dried stones and even
pale sickly heaths trying to show their delicate pink
blossoms

  at last it began to be really hot weather on the
th of june the thermometer stood at  above
zero the doctor scarcely believed his eyes but it was
a positive fact and it was soon confirmed by the
changed appearance of the country

  an excursion was made to johnsons island but it
turned out to be a barren little islet of no importance
whatever though it gave the old boatswain infinite
pleasure to know those sea-girt rocks bore his name

  there was some danger of both house and stores
melting but happily this high temperature proved ex-
ceptional the thermometer seldom averaging much
above freezing-point

  by the middle of june the sloop had made good
progress and already presented a shapely appearance
as bell and johnson took the work of construction
entirely on themselves the others went hunting and
succeeded in killing several deer altamont adopted
the indian practice of crawling on all-fours and ad-
justing his gun and arms so as to simulate horns and
deceive the timid animal till he could get near enough
to take good aim

  their principal object of pursuit however was the
musk-ox which parry had met with in such numbers in
melville island but not a solitary specimen was to be
seen anywhere about victoria bay and a distant ex-
cursion was resolved upon

  the three hunters accompanied by duk set out on
monday the th of june at six in the morning each
man armed with a double-barreled gun a hatchet and
snow-knife and provisions for several days

  it was a fine bright morning and by ten oclock they
had gone twelve miles but saw not a living thing


amazing stories

  however they went on in hope after a good break-
fast and half-an-hours rest

  the ground was getting gradually lower and pre-
sented a peculiar appearance from the snow which lay
here and there in ridges unmelted at a distance it
looked like the sea when a strong wind is lashing up
the waves and cresting them with a white foam

  before long they reached a sort of glen at the bot-
tom of which was a winding river it was almost com-
pletely thawed and already the banks were clothed with
a species of vegetation as if the sun had done his best
to fertilize the soil

  i tell you what said the doctor a few enterpris-
ing colonists might make a fine settlement here with
a little industry and perseverance wonders might be
done in this country ah if i am not much mistaken
it has some four-footed inhabitants already those
frisky little fellows know the best spots to choose

  hares i declare thats jolly said altamont
loading his gun

  stop cried the doctor stop you furious hunter
let the poor little things alone they are not thinking
of running away look they are actually coming to
us

  he was right for presently three or four young
hares gamboling away among the fresh moss and tiny
heaths came running about their legs so fearlessly
and trustfully that even altamont was disarmed they
rubbed against the doctors knees and let him stroke
them till the kind-hearted man could not help saying
to altamont

  why give shot to those who come for caresses  the
death of these little beasts could do us no good

  you say whats true clawbonny let them live
replied hatteras

  and these ptarmigans too i suppose and these long-
legged plovers added altamont as a whole covey of
birds flew down among the hunters never suspecting
their danger

  duk could not tell what to make of it and stood
there stupefied

  it was a strange and touching spectacle to see the
pretty creatures they flew on clawbonnys shoulders
and lay down at his feet as if inviting friendly caresses
and doing their utmost to welcome the strangers the
whole glen echoed with their joyous cries as they darted
to and fro from all parts the good doctor seemed
some mighty enchanter

  the hunters had continued their course along the
banks of the river when a sudden bend in the valley
revealed a herd of deer eight or ten in number peace-
fully browsing on some lichens that lay half-buried in
the snow they were charming creatures so graceful
and gentle male and female both adorned with noble
antlers wide-spreading and deeply-notched their skin
had already lost its winter whiteness and began to as-
sume the brown tint of summer strange to say they
appeared not a whit more afraid than the birds or
hares

  the three men were now right in the center of the
herd but not one made the least movement to run
away this time the worthy doctor had far more diffi-

culty in restraining altamonts impatience for the mere
sight of such magnificent animals roused his hunting in-
stincts and he became quite excited while hatteras
on the contrary seemed really touched to see the splen-
did creatures rubbing their heads so affectionately and
trustfully against the good clawbonny the friend of
every living thing

  but i say exclaimed altamont didnt we come
out expressly to hunt

  to hunt the musk-ox and nothing else replied
clawbonny besides we shouldnt know what to do
with this game even if we killed it we have provisions
enough let us for once enjoy the sight of men and
animals in perfect amity

  it proves no human beings have been here be-
fore said hatteras

  true arjd that proves something more these animals
are not of american origin

  how do you make that out said altamont
why if they had been born in north america they
would have known how to treat that mammiferous biped
called man and would have fled at the first glimpse of
us no they are from the north most likely from the
untrodden wilds of asia so altamont you have no
right to claim them as fellow countrymen

  oh a hunter doesnt examine his game so closely
as all that everything is grist that comes to his mill
all right calm yourself my brave nimrod for
my own part i would rather never fire another shot
than make one of these beautiful creatures afraid of
me see even duk fraternizes with them believe me
it is well to be kind where we can kindness is
power

  well well so be it said altamont not at all un-
derstanding such scruples but i should like to see
what you would do if you had no weapon but kindness
among a pack of bears or wolves you wouldnt make
much of it

  i make no pretensions to charm wild beasts i
dont believe much in orpheus and his enchantments
besides bears and wolves would not come to us like
these hares and partridges and deer

  why not they have never seen human beings
either

  no but they are savage by nature said claw-
bonny and ferocity like wickedness engenders sus-
picion this is true of men as well as animals

  they spent the whole day in the glen which the
doctor christened arctic arcadia and when evening
came they lay down to rest in the hollow of a rock
which seemed to have been expressly prepared for their
accommodation

          chapter xvii
          altamonts revenge

next morning as the fine weather still con-
tinued the hunters determined to have another
search for the musk-ox it was only fair to
give altamont a chance with the distinct understand-
ing that he should have the right of firing however
fascinating the game they might meet besides the
flesh of the musk-ox though a little too highly impreg-
the desert of ice



nated with the smell is savory food and the hunters
would gladly carry back a few pounds of it to fort
providence

  during the first part of the day nothing occurred
worth mentioning but they noticed a considerable
change in the aspect of the country and appearances
seemed to indicate that they were approaching a hilly
region this new america was evidently either a
continent or an island of considerable extent

  duk was running far ahead of his party when he
stopped suddenly short and began sniffing the ground
as if he had caught scent of game next minute he
rushed forward again with extreme rapidity and was
speedily out of sight but loud distinct barking con-
vinced the hunters that the faithful fellow had at last
discovered the desired object

  they hurried onwards and after an hour and a halfs
quick walking found him standing in front of two
formidable-looking animals and barking furiously the
doctor recognized them at once as belonging to the
musk-ox or ovibos genus as naturalists call it by the
very wide horns touching each other at their base by
the absence of muzzle by the narrow square fore-
head resembling that of a sheep and by the very short
tail their hair was long and thickly-matted and mixed
with fine brown silky wool

  these singular-looking quadrupeds were not the least
afraid of duk though extremely surprised but at the
first glimpse of the hunters they took flight and it was
no easy task to go after them for half an hours swift
running brought them no nearer and left the whole
party so out of breath that they were forced to come to
a halt

  confound the beasts said altamont

  yes altamont ill make them over to you replied
clawbonny they are true americans and they dont
appear to have a very favorable idea of their fellow-
countrymen

  that proves our hunting prowess rejoined alta-
mont

  meantime the oxen finding themselves no longer pur-
sued had stopped short further pursuit was evi-
dently useless if they were to be captured at all they
must be surrounded and the plateau which they first
happened to have reached was very favorable for the
purpose leaving duk to worry them they went down
by the neighboring ravines and got to one end of the
plateau where altamont and the doctor hid themselves
behind projecting rocks while hatteras went on to the
other end intending to startle the animals by his sud-
den appearance and drive them back towards his com-
panions

  i suppose you have no objection this time to be-
stow a few bullets on these gentry said altamont

  oh no it is a fair field now and no favor 
returned clawbonny

  the oxen had begun to shake themselves impatiently
at duk trying to kick him off when hatteras started
up right in front of them shouting and chasing them
hack this was the signal for altamont and the doctor
to rush forward and fire but at the sight of two assail-
ants the terrified animals wheeled round and attacked

hatteras he met their onset with a firm steady foot
and fired straight at their heads but both his balls
were powerless and only served still further to madden
the enraged beasts they rushed upon the unfortu-
nate man like furies and threw him on the ground in
an instant

  he is a dead man exclaimed the doctor in despair-
ing accents

  a tremendous struggle was going on in altamonts
breast at the sight of his prostrate foe and though his
first impulse was to hasten to his help he stopped short
battling with himself and his prejudices but his hesi-
tation scarcely lasted half a second his better self
conquered and he rushed forward with clawbonny

  hatteras full well understood how his rival felt but
would rather have died than have begged his interven-
tion however he had hardly time to think about it
before altamont was at his side

  he could not have held out much longer for it was
impossible to ward off the blows of horns and hoofs of
two such powerful antagonists and in a few minutes
more he must have been torn to pieces but suddenly
two shots resounded and hatteras felt the balls graze
his head

  courage shouted altamont flinging away his
discharged weapon and throwing himself right in front
of the raging animals one of them shot to the heart
fell dead as he reached the spot while the other dashed
madly on hatteras and was about to gore the unfor-
tunate captain with his horns when altamont plunged
his snow knife far into the beasts wide open jaws with
one hand and with the other dealt him such a tre-
mendous blow on the head with his hatchet that the
skull was completely split open

  it was done so quickly that it seemed like a flash of
lightning and all was over the second ox lay dead
and clawbonny shouted hurrah hurrah

  hatteras was saved

  he owed his life to the man he hated the most what
a storm of conflicting passions this must have roused in
his soul but where was the emotion he could not
master 

  however his action was prompt whatever his feeling
might be without a moments hesitancy he went up
to his rival and said in a grave voice

  altamont you have saved my life

  you saved mine replied the american

  there was a moments silence and then altamont
added

  were quits hatteras

  no altamont said the captain when the doctor
dragged you out of your icy tomb i did not know who
you were but you saved me at the peril of your own
life knowing quite well who i was

  why you are a fellow-creature at any rate and
whatever faults an american may have he is no
coward altamont said

  no indeed said the doctor he is a man every
inch as much as yourself hatteras

  and like me he shall have part in the glory that
awaits us

  the glory of reaching the north pole said alta-


amazing stories

i

mont i can share your glory in this discovery
  yes replied hatteras proudly

i guessed right then said altamont and you
have actually dared to conceive such a project oh it
is grand i tell you it is sublime even to think of it
but tell me said hatteras in a hurried manner
you were not bound for the pole then yourself
altamont hesitated

  come speak out man urged the doctor

  well to tell the truth i was not and the truth is
better than self-love no i had no such grand pur-
pose in view i was trying to find the northwest pas-
sage and that was all i would never have dreamed
of such a stupendous undertaking

  altamont said hatteras holding out his hand be
our companion to glory come with us and find the
north pole

  the two men clasped hands in a warm hearty grasp
and a strong bond of friendship between them was
sealed

  when they turned to look for the doctor they found
him in tears ah friends he said wiping his eyes
you have made me so happy it is almost more than i
can bear you have sacrificed this miserable nationality
for the sake of the common cause you have said
what does it matter if only the pole is discovered
whether it is by an englishman or an american why
should we brag of being american or english when
we can boast that we are men it is an infinitely more
worthwhile boast 

  the good little man was beside himself with joy he
hugged the reconciled enemies to his bosom and
cemented their newly found friendship by his own
affection to both

  at last he grew calm after at least a twentieth em-
brace and said

  it is time i went to work now since i am no hun-
ter i must use my talents in another direction

  and he began to cut up the oxen so skillfully that
he seemed like a surgeon making a delicate autopsy

  his two companions looked on smiling in a few
minutes the adroit operator had cut off more than a
hundred pounds of flesh this he divided into three
parts each man took one and they retraced their
steps to fort providence

  at ten oclock they arrived at doctors house where
johnson and bell had a good supper prepared for
them

  but before sitting down to enjoy it the doctor ex-
claimed in a jubilant tone and pointing to his two com-
panions said

  my dear old johnson i took out an american and
an englishman with me didnt i

  yes dr clawbonny

  well i bring back two brothers

  this was joyous news to the sailors and they shook
hands warmly with altamont while the doctor re-
counted all that had passed and how the american
captain had saved the english captains life

  that night no five happier men could have been
found anywhere than those five who lay sleeping in
the little snow-house

           chapter xviii
           final preparations

next day the weather changed and the cold re-
turned snow rain and tempest came in quick
succession for several days

   bell had completed the sloop and done his work well
for the little vessel was admirably adapted for the pur-
pose contemplated being high at the sides and partly
decked so as to be able to stand a heavy sea and yet
light enough to be drawn on the sledge without over-
burdening the dogs

   at last a change of the greatest importance took place
the ice began to tremble in the center of the bay and
the highest masses became loosened at their base ready
to form icebergs and drift away before the first gale
but hatteras would not wait for the ice-fields to break
up before he started since the journey must be made
on land he did not care whether the sea was open
or not and the day of departure was fixed for the th
of june-johnson and bell undertaking the necessary
repairs of the sled

   on the th finding there was space enough between
the broken ice to allow the sloop to get through it was
determined to take her on a trial trip to cape washing-
ton the sea was not quite open but it would have
been impossible to go across on foot

   this short sail of six hours sufficiently tested the
powers of the sloop and proved her excellent qualities
in coming back they witnessed a curious sight it was
the chase of a seal by a gigantic bear mr bruin was
too busily engaged to notice the vessel or he would
have pursued them he was intently watching beside a
seal-hole with the patience of a true hunter or rather
angler for he was certainly fishing just then

  but all of a sudden there was a slight disturbance
on the surface of the water in the hole which announced
the coming up of the amphibious animal instantly the
bear lay flat on his belly his two paws stretched round
the opening

   next minute up came the seal but his head no sooner
appeared above the water than the bears paws closed
about him like a vise and dragged him right out the
poor seal struggled desperately but could not free him-
self from the iron grasp of his enemy who hugged him
closer and closer till suffocation was complete then
he carried him off to his den as if the weight were noth-
ing leaping lightly from pack to pack till he gained
terra firma safely

  on the nd of june hatteras began to load the
sled they put in  lbs of salt meat three cases
of vegetables and preserved meat besides lime-juice
and flour and medicine they also took  lbs of
powder and a stock of fire-arms including the sloop
and the halkett-boat there was about  lbs weight
a heavy load for four dogs and all the more as they
would have to drag it every day instead of only four
days successively like the dogs employed by the esqui-
maux who always keep a relay for their sleds how-
ever the distance to the pole was not  miles at the
outside and they did not intend to go more than twelve
miles a day as they could do it comfortably in a month
the desert of ice



even if land failed them they could always fall back
on the sloop and finish the journey without fatigue
to men or dogs

  all the party were in excellent health though they
had lost flesh a little but by attending to the doctors
wise counsel they had weathered the winter without
being attacked by any of the maladies incident to the
climate

  now they were almost at their journeys end and no
one doubted of success for a common bond of sympathy
bound fast the five men and made them strong to
persevere on sunday the rd all was ready and it
was resolved to devote the entire day to rest

  the dwellers on fort providence could not see the
last day dawn without some emotion it cost them a
pang to leave the snow-hut which had served them in
such good stead and this hospitable shore where they
had passed the winter take it altogether they had
spent very happy hours there and the doctor made a
touching reference to the subject as they sat round the
table at the evening meal

  they retired early to rest for they needed to be up
betimes so passed the last night at fort providence

chapter xix
march to the north

next day at early dawn hatteras gave the signal
for departure the well-fed and well-rested
dogs were harnessed to the sled they had
been having a good time of it all the winter and might
be expected to do good service during the summer

  it was at six in the morning when the expedition
started after following the windings of the hay and
going past cape washington they struck into the direct
route for the north and by seven oclock had lost sight
of the lighthouse and fort providence

  during the first two days they made twenty miles in
twelve hours devoting the remainder of the time to rest
and meals the tent was quite sufficient protection
during sleep

  the temperature began to rise in many places the
snow melted entirely away and great patches of water
appeared here and there complete ponds which a little
stretch of imagination might easily convert into lakes
the travelers were often up to their knees but they
only laughed over it and indeed the doctor was rather
glad of such unexpected baths

  but for all that he said the water has no business
to wet us here it is an element which has no right
in this country except in a solid or vaporous state ice
or vapor is all very well but water-never

  hunting was not forgotten during the march for
fresh meat was a necessity altamont and bell kept
their guns loaded and shot ptarmigans guillemots
geese and a few young hares but by degrees birds and
animals had been changing from trustfulness to fear
and had become so shy and difficult to approach that
very often but for duk the hunters would have wasted
their powder

  hatteras advised them not to go more than a mile
away as there was not a day nor even an hour to lose

for three months of fine weather was the utmost they
could count upon besides the sled was often com-
ing to difficult places when each man was needed to
lend a helping hand

  on the third day they came to a lake several acres
in extent and still entirely frozen over the suns
rays had little access to it owing to its situation and
the ice was so strong that it must have dated from
some remote winter it was strong enough to bear
both the travelers and their sled and was covered with
dry snow

  from this point the country became gradually lower
from which the doctor concluded that this new amer-
ica did not extend to the pole but was most probably
an island

  up to this time the expedition had been attended
with no fatigue the travelers had only suffered from
the intense glare of the sun on the snow which threat-
ened them with snow-blindness at another time of
the year they might have avoided this by walking dur-
ing the night but at present there was no night at all
happily the snow was beginning to melt and the bril-
liancy would diminish as the process of dissolution ad-
vanced

  on the th of june the thermometer rose to  and
the rain fell in torrents hatteras and his companions
however marched stoically on and even hailed the
downpour with delight knowing that it would hasten
the disappearance of the snow

  as they went along the doctor often picked up stones
both round ones and flat pebbles as if worn away by
the tide he thought from this they must be near the
polar basin and yet far as the eye could reach was one
interminable plain

  there was not a trace of houses or huts or cairns
visible it was evident that the greenlanders had not
pushed their way so far north and yet the famished
tribes would have found their account in coming for
the country abounded in game

  on the th bell killed a fox and altamont a musk-
ox these supplies of fresh food were very acceptable
and even the doctor surveyed with considerable satis-
faction the haunches of meat they managed to procure
from time to time

  dont let us stint ourselves he used to say on these
occasions food is no unimportant matter in expedi-
tions like ours

  especially said johnson when a meal depends
on a lucky shot

  youre right johnson a man does not think so
much about dinner when he knows the soup-pot is
simmering by the kitchen-fire

  on the th they came to a district which seemed to
have been upturned by some volcanic convulsion so
covered was it with cones and sharp lofty peaks a
strong breeze from the southeast was blowing which
soon increased to a hurricane sweeping over the rocks
cohered with snow and the huge masses of ice which
took the forms of icebergs and hummocks though on
dry land

  the tempest was followed by damp warm weather
which caused a regular thaw on all sides nothing


amazing stories

could be heard but the noise of cracking ice and falling
avalanches the travelers had to be very careful in
avoiding hills and even in speaking aloud for the
slightest agitation in the air might have caused a
catastrophe indeed the suddenness is the peculiar
feature in arctic avalanches distinguishing them from
those of switzerland and norway often the dis-
lodgment of a block of ice is instantaneous and not
even a cannon-ball or thunderbolt could be more rapid
in its descent the loosening the fall and the crash
happen almost simultaneously

  happily however no accident befell any of the
party and three days afterwards they came to smooth
level ground again but here a new phenomenon met
their gaze-a phenomenon which was long a subject
of patient inquiry among the learned of both hemi-
spheres they came to a long chain of low hills which
seemed to extend for miles and were all covered on
the eastern side with bright red snow

  it is easy to imagine the surprise and half-terrified
exclamation of the little company at the sight of this
long red curtain but the doctor hastened to reassure
them or rather to instruct them as to the nature of
this peculiar snow he told them that this same red
substance had been found in switzerland in the heart
of the alps and that the color proceeded solely from the
presence of certain corpuscles about the nature of
which for a long time chemists could not agree they
could not decide whether these corpuscles were of
animal or vegetable origin but at last it was settled
that they belonged to the family of fungi being a sort
of microscopic mushroom of the species urcdo

  piercing the snow over with his iron-tipped staff
the doctor found that the coloring matter extended
to a depth of nine feet he pointed this out to his
companions that they might have some idea of the
enormous number of these tiny mushrooms in a layer
extending so many miles

  this phenomenon was none the less strange for
being explained for red is a color seldom seen in na-
ture over any considerable area the reflection of the
suns rays upon it produced the most peculiar effect
lighting up men and animals and rocks with a fiery
glow as if proceeding from some flame within when
the snow melted it looked like blood as the red particles
do not decompose it seemed to the travelers as if
rivulets of blood were running among their feet

  the doctor filled several bottles with this precious
substance to examine at leisure as he had had only a
passing glimpse of the crimson cliffs in baffin bay

  this field of blood as he called it took three hours
to get over and then the country resumed its usual
aspect

chapter xx
footprints in the snow

on the fourth of july there was such an exceed-
ingly dense fog that it was very difficult to
keep the straight course for the north no mis-
adventure however befell the party during the dark-
ness except the loss of bells snow-shoes at bells
suggestion which fired the doctors inventive genius

torches were contrived made of tow steeped in spir-
its-of-wine and fastened on the end of a stick and
these served somewhat to help them on though they
made but small progress for on the sixth day after
the fog had cleared off the doctor took their bearings
and found that they had only been marching at the
rate of eight miles a day

  determined to make up for lost time they rose next
morning very early and started off bell and altamont
as usual going ahead of the rest and acting as scouts
johnson and the others kept beside the sled and
were soon nearly two miles behind the guides but
the weather was so dry and clear that all their move-
ments could be distinctly observed

  what now  said clawbonny as he saw them make
a sudden halt and stoop down as if examining the
ground

  i was just wondering what they are about myself
replied old johnson

  perhaps they have come on the tracks of animals
suggested hatteras

  no said clawbonny it cant be that

  why not

  because duk would bark

  well it is quite evident they are examining some
sort of marks

  lets go on then said hatteras and urging for-
ward the dogs they rejoined their companions in
about twenty minutes and shared their surprise at find-
ing unmistakable fresh footprints of human beings
in the snow

  they are esquimaux footprints said hatteras
  do you think so  asked altamont

  there is no doubt of it

  but what do you make of this then returned
altamont pointing to another footmark repeated in
several places do you believe for a minute that was
made by an esquimau 

  it was incontestably the print of a european boot-
nails sole and heel clearly stamped in the snow there
was no room for doubt and hatteras exclaimed in
amazement europeans here

  evidently said johnson

  and yet it is so improbable that we must take a
second look before pronouncing an opinion said
clawbonny

  but the longer he looked the more apparent became
the fact hatteras was chagrined beyond measure
a european here so near the pole

  the footprints extended for about a quarter of a
mile and then diverged to the west should the trav-
elers follow them farther

  no said hatteras let us go on

  he was interrupted by an exclamation from the
doctor who had just picked up an object that gave
still more convincing proof of european origin it was
a part of a pocket spy-glass

  well if we still had any doubts about the foot-
marks this settles the case at once said clawbonny

  forward exclaimed hatteras so energetically that
instinctively each one obeyed and the march was re-
sumed forthwith the day wore away but no further
the desert of ice



sign of the presence of any rivals was discovered and
they prepared to encamp for the night the tent was
pitched in a ravine for shelter as the sky was dark and
threatening and a violent north wind was blowing

  im afraid well have a bad night said johnson

  a pretty noisy one i expect replied the doctor
but not cold we had better take every precaution
and fasten our tent with good big stones

  you are right dr clawbonny if the hurricane
swept away our tent i dont know where we should
find it again

  the tent held fast but sleep was impossible for the
tempest was let loose and raged with tremendous vio-
lence during the night

  it seems to me said the doctor during a brief lull
in the deafening roar as if i could hear the sound
of collisions between icebergs and ice-fields if we
were near the sea i could really believe there was a
general breaking-up in the ice

  i cant explain the noises any other way said
johnson

  can we have reached the coast i wonder asked
hatteras

  it is not impossible replied clawbonny listen
do you hear that crash that is certainly the sound
of icebergs falling we surely cannot be very far
from the ocean

  well if it turns out to be so i shall push right on
over the ice-fields

  oh theyll be all broken up after such a storm as
this we shall see what to-morrow brings but all i can
say is if any poor fellows are wandering about in a
night like this i pity them

  the storm lasted for ten hours and the weary travel-
ers anxiously watched for the morning about day-
break its fury seemed to have spent itself and hat-
teras accompanied by bell and altamont ventured to
leave the tent they climbed a hill about three hun-
dred feet high which commanded a wide view but
what a metamorphosed region met their gaze all the
ice had completely vanished the storm had chased
away the winter and stripped the soil everywhere of
its snow covering

  but hatteras scarcely bestowed a glance on surround-
ing objects his eager gaze was bent on the northern
horizon which appeared shrouded in black mist

  that may very likely be caused by the ocean sug-
gested clawbonny

  you are right the sea must be there was the
reply

  that tint is what we call the blink of open water
said johnson

  come wi then to the sled at once and let us get
to this unknown ocean exclaimed hatteras

  their few preparations were soon made and the
inarch resumed three hours afterwards they arrived
at the coast and shouted simultaneously the sea
the sea

  ay and open sea added hatteras

  and so it was the storm had opened wide the polar
basin and loosened packs were drifting in all direc-
tions

  the icebergs had weighed anchor and were sailing
out into the open sea this new ocean stretched out
of sight and not a single island or continent was visible

  on the east and west the coast formed two capes or
headlands which sloped gently down to the sea in
the center a projecting rock formed a small natural
bay sheltered on three sides into which a wide river
fell bearing in its bosom the melted snows of winter

  after a careful survey of the coast hatteras de-
termined to launch the sloop that very day and to un-
pack the sled and get everything on board the
tent was soon put up and a comfortable repast pre-
pared this important business despatched work com-
menced and all hands were so expeditious and will-
ing that by five oclock nothing more remained to be
done the sloop lay rocking gracefully in the little
bay and all the cargo was on board the boat except
the tent and what was required for the nights en-
campment

  the sight of the sloop suggested to clawbonny the
propriety of giving altamonts name to the little bay
his proposition to that effect met with unanimous ap-
proval and the port was forthwith dignified by the
title of altamont harbor

  according to the doctors calculations the travelers
were now only  distant from the pole they had
gone over two hundred miles from victoria bay to
altamont harbor and were in latitude   and 


            chapter xxi
            the open sea

next morning by eight oclock all the remaining
effects were on board and the preparations for
departure completed but before starting the
doctor thought he would like to take a last look at the
country and see if any further traces of the presence
of strangers could be discovered for the mysterious
footmarks they had met with were never out of his
thoughts he climbed to the top of a height which
commanded a view of the whole southern horizon and
took out his pocket-telescope but what was his as-
tonishment to find he could see nothing through it not
even neighboring objects he rubbed his eyes and
looked again but with no better result then he began
to examine the telescope the object-glass was gone

  the object-glass this explained the whole mystery
footprints and all and with a shout of surprise he hur-
ried down the hill to impart his discovery to the won-
dering companions who came running towards him
startled by his loud exclamation and full of anxiety
at his precipitate descent

  well what is the matter now said johnson

  the doctor could hardly speak he was so out of
breath at last he managed to gasp out

  the tracks footmarks strangers

  what said hatteras strangers here

  no no the object-glass the object-glass out of my
telescope

  and he held out his spy-glass for them to look at

  ah i see said altamont it is wanting

  yes


amazing stories

  but then the footmarks

  they were ours friends just ours exclaimed the
doctor we had lost ourselves in the fog and had
been wandering in a circle

  but the boot marks objected hatteras

  bells he walked about a whole day after he had
lost his snow shoes

  so i did said bell the mistake was so evident
that they all laughed heartily except hatteras though
no one was more glad than he at the discovery

  a quarter of an hour afterwards the little sloop
sailed out of altamont harbor and commenced her
voyage of discovery the wind was favorable but
there was little of it and the weather was positively
warm

  the sloop was none the worse for the sled journey
she was in first-rate trim and easily managed john-
son steered the doctor bell and the american leaned
back against the cargo and hatteras stood at the prow
his fixed eager gaze bent steadily on that mysterious
point towards which he felt drawn with irresistible
power like the magnetic needle to the pole he
wished to be the first to descry any shore that might
come in sight and he had every right to the honor

  the water of this polar sea presented some peculiar
features worth mentioning in color it was a faint
ultra-marine blue and possessed such a wonderful
transparency that one seemed to gaze down into fath-
omless depths these depths were lighted up no doubt
by some electrical phenomenon and so many varieties
of living creatures were visible that the vessel seemed
to be sailing over a vast aquarium

  innumerable flocks of birds were flying over the sur-
face of this marvelous ocean darkening the sky like
thick heavy storm-clouds water-fowl of every de-
scription were among them from the albatross to the
penguin and all of gigantic proportions their cries
were absolutely deafening and some of them had such
immense wide-spreading wings that they covered the
sloop completely as they flew over the doctor thought
himself a good naturalist but he found his science
greatly at fault for many a species here was wholly
unknown to any ornithological society

  the good little man was equally nonplussed when
he looked at the water for he saw the most wonderful
medusae some so large that they looked like little islands
floating about among brobdingnagian sea-weeds and
below the surface what a spectacle met the eye my-
riads of fish of every species young seals at play with
each other narwhals with their one strong weapon of
defense like the horn of a unicorn chasing the timid
seals whales of every tribe spouting out columns of
water and filling the air with a peculiar whizzing
noise dolphins seals and walruses quietly browsing
on submarine pastures and the doctor could gaze at
them all as easily and clearly as if they were in glass
tanks in the zoological gardens

  there was a strange supernatural purity about the
atmosphere it seemed charged to overflowing with
oxygen and had a marvelous power of exhilaration
producing an almost intoxicating effect on the brain

  towards evening hatteras and his companions lost

sight of the coast night came on though the sun re-
mained just above the horizon it had the same in-
fluence on animated nature as in temperate zones birds
fish and all the cetacea disappeared and perfect silence
prevailed

  since the departure from altamont harbor the
sloop had made one degree farther north the next
day brought no signs of land there was not even a
speck on the horizon the wind was still favorable
and the sea pretty calm the birds and fishes re-
turned as numerously as on the preceding day and the
doctor leaning over the side of the vessel could see
the whales and the dolphins and all the rest of the
monsters of the deep gradually coming up from the
clear depths below on the surface far as the eye
could reach nothing was visible except a solitary ice-
berg here and there and a few scattered floes

  indeed but little ice was met with anywhere the
sloop was ten degrees above the point of greatest cold
and consequently in the same temperature as baffin
bay and disko it was therefore not astonishing that
the sea should be open in these summer months

  this is a fact of great practical value for if ever the
whalers can penetrate north as far as the polar basin
they may be sure of an immediate cargo as this part of
the ocean seems to be the general reservoir of whales -
and seals and every marine species

  the day wore on but still nothing appeared on the
horizon hatteras never left the prow of the ship
but stood glass in hand eagerly gazing into the dis-
tance with anxious questioning eyes

chapter xxii
getting near the pole

hour after hour passed away and still hatteras
persevered in his weary watch though his hopes
appeared doomed to disappointment

  at length about six in the evening a dim hazy
shapeless sort of mist seemed to rise far away between
sea and sky it was not a cloud for it was constantly
vanishing and then reappearing next minute

  hatteras was the first to notice this peculiar phenom-
enon  but after an hours scrutiny through his telescope
he could make nothing of it

  all at once however some sure indication met his
eye and stretching out his arm to the horizon he
shouted in a clear ringing voice

  land land

  his words produced an electrical effect on his com-
panions and every man rushed to his side

  i see it i see it said clawbonny

  yes yes so do i exclaimed johnson

  it is a cloud said altamont

  land land repeated hatteras in tones of abso-
lute conviction

  even while he spoke the appearance vanished and
when it returned again the doctor fancied he caught a
gleam of light about the smoke for an instant

  it is a volcano he exclaimed

  a volcano repeated altamont

  undoubtedly
the desert of ice



  in so high a latitude

  why not is not iceland a volcanic island-in-
deed almost made of volcanoes one might say

  well has not our famous countryman james ross
affirmed the existence of two active volcanoes the
erebus and the error on the southern continent in
longitude  and latitude  why then should
not volcanoes be found near the north pole

  it is possible certainly replied altamont

  ah now i see it distinctly exclaimed the doctor
it is a volcano

  let us make right for it then said hatteras

  it was impossible longer to doubt the proximity of
the coast in twenty-four hours probably the bold
navigators might hope to set foot on its untrodden
soil but strange as it was now that they were so
near the goal of their voyage no one showed the joy
which might have been expected each man sat silent
absorbed in his own thoughts wondering what sort of
place this pole must be the birds seemed to shun it
for though it was evening they were all flying towards
the south with outspread wings was it then so in-
hospitable that not so much as a sea-gull or a ptarmigan
could find a shelter the fish too even the large
cetacea were hastening away through the transparent
waters what could cause this feeling either of re-
pulsion or terror

  at last sleep overcame the tired men and one after
another dropped off leaving hatteras to keep watch

  he took the helm and tried his best not to close his
eyes for he grudged losing precious time but the
slow motion of the vessel rocked him into a state of
such irresistible somnolence that in spite of himself he
was soon like his companions locked fast in deep
slumber he began to dream and imagination brought
back all the scenes of his past life he dreamed of his
ship the forward and of the traitors that had burned
it again he felt all the agonies of disappointment and
failure and forgot his actual situation then the scene
changed and he saw himself at the pole unfurling the
union jack

  while memory and fancy were thus busied an enor-
mous cloud of an olive tinge had begun to darken sea
and sky a hurricane was at hand the first blast
of the tempest roused the captain and his companions
and they were on their feet in an instant ready to meet
it the sea had risen tremendously and the ship was
tossing violently up and down on the billows hatteras
took the helm again and kept a firm hold of it while
johnson and bell baled out the water which was con-
stantly dashing over the ship

  it was a difficult matter to preserve the right course
for the thick fog made it impossible to see more than
a few yards off

  this sudden tempest might well seem to such excited
men a stern prohibition against further approach to
the pole but it needed but a glance at their resolute
faces to know that they would yield neither to winds
ior waves

  for a whole day the struggle lasted death threatening
them each moment but about six in the evening just
as the fury of the waves seemed at its highest pitch

there came a sudden calm the wind was stilled as if
miraculously and the sea became smooth as glass

  then came a most extraordinary inexplicable phe-
nomenon

  the fog without dispersing became strangely lum-
inous and the sloop sailed along in a zone of electric
light mast sail and rigging appeared penciled in
black against the phosphorescent sky with wondrous
distinctness the men were bathed in light and their
faces shone with a fiery glow

  the volcano exclaimed hatteras

  is it possible said bell

  no no replied clawbonny we should be suffo-
cated with its flames so near

  perhaps it is the reflection suggested altamont

  not that much even for then we must be near
land and in that case we should hear the noise of the
eruption

  what is it then asked the captain

  it is a cosmical phenomenon replied the doctor
seldom met hitherto if we go on we shall soon get
out of our luminous sphere and be back in the darkness
and tempest again

  well lets go on come what may said hatteras

  the doctor was right gradually the fog began to
lose its light and then its transparency and the howling
wind was heard not far off a few minutes more and
the little vessel was caught in a violent squall and swept
back into the cyclone

  but the hurricane had fortunately turned a point
towards the south and left the vessel free to run before
the wind straight towards the pole there was im-
minent danger of her sinking for she sped along at
frenzied speed and any sudden collision with rock or
iceberg must have inevitably dashed her to pieces

  but not a man on board counseled prudence they
were intoxicated with the danger and no speed could
be quick enough to satisfy their longing impatience to
reach the unknown

  at last they began evidently to near the coast strange
symptoms were manifest in the air the fog suddenly
rent like a curtain torn by the wind and for an instant
like a flash of lightning an immense column of flame
was seen on the horizon

  the volcano the volcano was the simultaneous
exclamation

  but the words had hardly passed their lips before
the fantastic vision had vanished the wind suddenly
changed to the southeast and drove the boat back
again from the land

  confound it said hatteras we werent three
miles from the coast

  however resistance was impossible all that could
be done was to keep tacking but every few minutes the
little sloop would be thrown on her side though she
righted herself again immediately obedient to the helm

  as hatteras stood with disheveled hair grasping the
helm as if welded to his hand he seemed the animating
soul of the vessel

  all at once a fearful sight met his gaze

  scarcely twenty yards in front was a great block
of ice coming right towards them mounting and falling


amazing stories

on the stormy billows ready to overturn at any moment
and crush them in its descent

  but this was not the only danger that threatened the
bold navigators the iceberg was packed with white
bears huddling close together and evidently beside
themselves with terror

  the iceberg made frightful lurches sometimes inclin-
ing at such a sharp angle that the animals rolled pell-
mell over each other and set up a loud growling which
mingled with the roar of the elements and made a ter-
rible concert

  for a quarter of an hour which seemed a whole
century the sloop sailed on in this formidable com-
pany sometimes a few yards distant and sometimes
near enough to touch the greenland dogs trembled
for fear but duk was quite imperturbable at last the
iceberg lost ground and got driven by the wind farther
and farther away till it disappeared in the fog only at
intervals betraying its presence by the ominous growls
of its crew

  the storm now burst forth with redoubled fury
the little bark was lifted bodily out of the water and
wkirled round and round with the most frightful rapid-
ity mast and sail were blown away and went flying
through the darkness like some huge white bird a
whirlpool began to form among the waves drawing
down the ship gradually by its irresistible suction
deeper and deeper she sank whizzing round at such
tremendous speed that to the poor fellows on board
the water seemed motionless all five men stood erect
gazing at each other in speechless terror but suddenly
the boat rose perpendicularly her bow went above the
edge of the vortex and getting out of the center of
attraction by her own velocity she escaped at a tangent
from the circumference and was thrown far beyond
like a ball from a cannons mouth

  altamont the doctor johnson and bell were pitched
flat on the planks when they got up hatteras had
disappeared

  it was two oclock in the morning

           chapter xxiii
           the english flag

or a few seconds they seemed stupefied and then
a cry of hatteras  broke from every lip

  on all sides nothing was visible but the tem-
pestuous ocean duk barked desperately and bell
could hardly keep him from leaping into the waves

  take the helm altamont said the doctor and let
us try our utmost to find our poor captain

  johnson and bell seized the oars and rowed about
for more than an hour but their search was vain-
hatteras was lost

  lost-and so near the pole just as he had caught
sight of the goal

  the doctor called and shouted and fired signals
and duk made piteous lamentations but there was no
response clawbonny could bear up no longer he
buried his head in his hands and fairly wept aloud

  at such a distance from the coast it was impossible
for hatteras to reach it alive without an oar or even

so much as a spar fco help him if ever he touched the
haven of his desire it vrould be as a swollen mutilated
corpse

  longer search was useless and nothing remained but
to resume the route north the tempest was dying
out and about five in the morning on the th of july
the wind fell and the sea gradually became calm the
sky recovered its polar clearness and less than three
miles away the land appeared in all its grandeur

  the next continent was only an island or rather a
volcano fixed like a lighthouse on the north pole of
the world

  the mountain was in full activity pouring out a mass
of white hot stones and glowing rock at every fresh
eruption there was a convulsive heaving within as if
some mighty giant were respiring and the masses
ejected were thrown up high into the air amidst jets
of bright flames streams of lava rolling down the sides
in impetuous torrents in one part serpents of fire
seemed writhing and wriggling amongst smoking rocks
and in another the glowing liquid fell in cascades in the
midst of purple vapor into a river of fire below formed
of a thousand igneous streams which emptied itself
into the sea the waters hissing and seething like a
boiling cauldron

  apparently there was only one crater to the vol-
cano out of which the columns of fire issued streaked
with forked lightning electricity seemed to have
something to do with this magnificent panorama

  above the panting flames waved an immense plume-
shaped cloud of smoke red at its base and black at its
summit it rose with incomparable majesty and un-
rolled in thick volumes

  the sky was ash-color to a great height and it was
evident that the darkness that had prevailed while the
tempest lasted which had seemed quite inexplicable to
the doctor was owing to the columns of cinders over-
spreading the sun like a thick curtain he remembered
a similar phenomenon which occurred in the barbadoes
where the whole island was plunged in profound ob-
scurity by the mass of cinders ejected from the crater
of isle st vincent

  this enormous volcanic rock in the middle of the
sea was six thousand feet high just about the altitude
of hecla

  it seemed to rise gradually out of the water as the
boat got nearer there was no trace of vegetation
indeed there was no shore the rock ran straight down
to the sea

  can we land said the doctor

  the wind is carrying us right to it said altamont

  but i dont see an inch of land to set our foot
upon

  it seems so at this distance said johnson but
we shall be sure to find some place to run in our boat
at and that is all we want

  let us go then said clawbonny dejectedly

  he had no heart now for anything the north pole
was indeed before his eyes but not the man who had
discovered it

  as they got nearer the island which was not more
than eight or ten miles in circumference the naviga-
the desert of ice



tors noticed a tiny fiord just large enough to harbor
their boat and made towards it immediately they
feared their captains dead body would meet their eyes
on the coast and yet it seemed difficult for a corpse to
lie on it for there was no shore and the sea broke on
steep rocks which were covered with cinders above
watermark

  at last the little boat glided gently into the narrow
opening between two sandbanks just visible above the
water where she would be safe from the violence of
the breakers but before she could be moored duk be-
gan howling and barking again in the most piteous
manner as if calling on the cruel sea and stony rocks
to yield up his lost master the doctor tried to calm
him by caresses but in vain the faithful beast as
if he would represent the captain sprang on shore
with a tremendous bound sending a cloud of cinders
afer him

 duk duk called clawbonny

  but duk had already disappeared

  after the sloop was made fast they all got out and
went after him altamont was just going to climb to
the top of a pile of stones when the doctor exclaimed
listen listen

  duk was barking vehemently some distance off but
his bark seemed full of grief rather than fury

  has he come on the track of some animal do you
think asked johnson

  no no said clawbonny shuddering his bark
is too sorrowful it is the dogs tear he has foundtthe
body of hatteras

  they all four rushed forward in spite of the blind-
ing cinder-dust and came to the far end of a fiord
where they discovered the dog barking round a corpse
wrapped in the british flag

  hatteras hatteras cried the doctor throwing
himself on the body of his friend but next minute
he started up with an indescribable cry and shouted
alive alive

  yes said a feeble voice yes alive at the north
pole on queens island

  hurrah for england shouted all with one accord

  and for america added clawbonny holding out
one hand to hatteras and the other to altamont

  duk was not behind with his hurrah which was
worth quite as much as the others

  for a few minutes the joy at the recovery of their
captain filled all their hearts and the poor fellows could
not restrain their tears

  the doctor found on examination that he was not
seriously hurt the wind threw him on the coast where
landing was perilous work but after being driven back
more than once into the sea the hardy sailor had man-
aged to scramble out oil a rock and gradually to hoist
himself above the waves

  then he must have become insensible for he remem-
bered nothing more except rolling himself in his flag
he only awoke to consciousness with the loud barking
and caresses of his faithful duk

  after a little hatteras was able to stand up sup-
ported by the doctor and tried to get back to the
boat

  he kept exclaiming the pole the north pole

  you are happy now said his friend

  yes happy and are not you isnt it a joy to
find yourself here the ground we tread is round the
pole the air we breathe is the air that blows round
the pole the sea we have crossed is the sea which
washes the pole oh the north pole the north
pole

  he had became quite delirious with excitement and
fever burned in his veins his eyes shone with un-
natural brilliancy and his brain seemed on fire perfect
rest was what he most needed for the doctor found
it impossible to quiet him

  a place of encampment must therefore be fixed
upon immediately

altamont speedily discovered a grotto composed
of rocks which had so fallen as to form a sort of
cave johnson and bell carried in provisions and
gave the dogs their liberty	

  about eleven oclock breakfast or rather dinner
was ready consisting of pemmican salt meat and
smoking-hot tea and coffee

  but hatteras would do nothing till the exact posi-
tion of the island was ascertained so the doctor and
altamont set to work with their instruments and found
that the exact latitude of the grotto was   
the longitude was of little importance for all the
meridians blended a few hundred feet higher

  the  of latitude was then only about three-quar-
 ters of a mile off or just about the summit of the vol-
 cano

  when the result was communicated to hatteras he
desired that a formal document might be drawn up to
attest the fact and two copies made one of which
should be deposited on a cairn on the island

  clawbonny was the scribe and indited the following
 document a copy of which is now among the archives
 of the royal geographical society of london-

  on this th day of july  in north latitude
   was discovered queens island at the north
pole by captain hatteras commander of the brig for-
ward of liverpool who signs this as do also all his
companions

  whoever may find this document is requested to
forward it to the admiralty

signed john hatteras commander of
the fonvard

                dr clawbonny

                altamont commander of the
                    porpoise

johnson boatswain

                   bell carpenter

  and now friends come to table said the doctor
 merrily

  coming to table was just squatting on the ground

  but who said clawbonny would not give all the
tables and dining-rooms in the world to dine at  
and  n latitude

  it was an exciting occasion this first meal at the


amazing stories

pole what neither ancients nor moderns neither
europeans nor americans nor asiatics had been able
to accomplish was now achieved and all past sufferings
and perils and losses were forgotten in the glow of
success

  but after all said johnson after toasts to hat-
teras and the north pole had been enthusiastically
drunk what is there so very special about the north
pole will you tell me dr clawbonny why we risk
so much to reach the pole

  just this my good johnson it is the only point of
the globe that is motionless all the other points are re-
volving with extreme rapidity

  but i dont see that we are any more motionless here
than at liverpool

  because in both cases you are a party concerned
both in the motion and the rest but the fact is certain
nevertheless

  clawbonny then went on to describe the diurnal and
annual motions of the earth-the one round its own
axis the extremities of which are the poles which is ac-
complished in twenty-four hours and the other round
the sun which takes a whole year

  bell and johnson listened half incredulously and
couldnt see why the earth could not have been allowed
to keep still till altamont informed them that they
would then have had neither day nor night nor spring
nor summer nor autumn nor winter

  ay and worse still said clawbonny if the mo-
tion chanced to be interrupted we should fall right into
the sun in sixty-four and a half days

  what take sixty-four and a half days to fall  ex-
claimed johnson

  yes we are ninety-five millions of miles off but
when i say the pole is motionless it is not strictly
true it is only so in comparison with the rest of the
globe for it has a certain movement of its own and
completes a circle in about twenty-six thousand years
this comes from the precession of the equinoxes

  a long and learned talk was started on this subject
between altamont and the doctor simplified however
as much as possible for the benefit of bell and john-
son

  hatteras took no part in it and even when they went
on to speculate about the earths center and discussed
several of the theories that had been advanced respect-
ing it he seemed not to hear it was evident his
thoughts were far away

  among other opinions put forth was one in our own
days which greatly excited altamonts surprise it was
held that there was an immense opening at the poles
which led into the heart of the earth and that it was
out of the opening that the light of the aurora borealis
streamed this was gravely stated and captain
symmes a countryman of our own actually proposed
that sir humphrey davy humboldt and arago should
undertake an expedition through it but they refused
absolutely

  and quite right too said altamont

  so say i but you see my friends what absurdities
imagination has conjured up about those regions and
how sooner or later the simple reality comes to light

           chapter xxiv
           mount hatteras

after this conversation they all made themselves
as comfortable as they could and lay down to
k sleep

  all except hatteras and why could this extraordi-
nary man not sleep like the others  was not the pur-
pose of his life attained now had he not realized
his most daring project why could he not rest in-
deed might not one have supposed that after the strain
his nervous system had undergone he would long for
rest 

  but no he grew more and more excited and it was
not the thought of returning that so affected him was
he bent on going further still had his passion for
travel no limits was the world too small for him
now he had circumnavigated it

  what ever might be the cause he could not sleep
yet this first night at the pole was clear and calm
the isle was absolutely uninhabited

  next morning when altamont and the others awoke
hatteras was gone feeling uneasy at his absence
they hurried out of the grotto in search of him there
he was standing on a rock gazing fixedly at the top of
the mountain his instruments were in his hand and
he was evidently determining the exact longitude and
latitude

  the doctor went towards him and spoke but it was
long before he could rouse him from his absorbing con-
templations at last the captain seemed to understand
and clawbonny said

  let us go round the island here we are all ready
for our last excursion

  the last repeated hatteras as if in a dream
yes the last truly but he added with more ani-
mation the most wonderful

  he pressed both hands on his brow as he spoke as if
to calm the inward tumult

  just then altamont and the others came up and their
appearance seemed to dispel the hallucinations under
which he was laboring

  my friends he said in a voice full of emotion
thanks for your courage thanks for your perseverance
thanks for your superhuman efforts through which we
are permitted to set our feet on this soil

  captain said johnson we have only obeyed
orders to you alone belongs the honor

  no no exclaimed hatteras with a violent out-
burst of emotion to all of you as much as to me
to altamont as much as any of us as much as the
doctor himself oh let my heart break in your hands
it cannot contain its joy and gratitude any longer

  he grasped the hands of his brave companions as he
spoke and paced up and down as if he had lost all
self-control

  and as friends added clawbonny

yes but all did not do it replied hatteras some
gave way however we must pardon them-pardon
both the traitors and those who were led away by them
poor fellows i forgive them you hear me doctor
yes replied clawbonny beginning to be seriously
the desert of ice



 uneasy at his friends excitement at sight of the crater

 i have no wish therefore continued the captain
 that they should lose the little fortune they came so
 far to seek no the original agreement is to remain
 unaltered and they shall be rich-if ever they see eng-
 land again

 it would have been difficult not to have been touched
 by the pathetic tone of voice in which hatteras said
 this

 but captain interrupted johnson trying to joke
 one would think you were making your will
 perhaps i am said hatteras gravely

 and yet you have a long bright career of glory
 before you

 who knows was the reply

 no one answered and the doctor did not dare to
 guess his meaning but hatteras soon made them un-
 derstand it for presently he said in a hurried agitated
 manner as if he could scarcely command himself

 friends listen to me we have done much already
 but much yet remains to be done

 his companions heard him with profound astonish-
 ment

 yes he resumed we are close to the pole but we
 are not on it

 how do you make that out said altamont

 yes replied hatteras with vehemence i said an
 englishman should plant his foot on the pole of the
 world i said it and an englishman shall

 what cried clawbonny

 we are still  from the unknown point resumed
 hatteras with increasing animation and to that point
 i shall go

 but it is on the summit of the volcano said the
 doctor

 i shall go

 it is an inaccessible cone

 i shall go

 but it is a yawning fiery crater

 i shall go

 his friends were stupefied and gazed in terror at
 the blazing mountain

 at last the doctor recovered himself and began to
 urge and entreat hatteras to renounce his project he
 tried every means his heart dictated from humble sup-
 plications to friendly threats but he could gain noth-
 ing-a sort of frenzy had come over the captain an
 absolute monomania about the pole

 nothing but violent measures would keep him back
 from destruction but the doctor was unwilling to em-
 ploy these yet

 he trusted moreover that physical impossibilities
 insuperable obstacles would bar his further progress
 and meantime finding all protestations were useless he
 simply said

 very well since you are bent on it well go too
 yes replied hatteras half-way up the mountain
 but not a step beyond you know you have to carry
 back to england the duplicate of the document in the
 cairn-

 yes but-

 it is settled said hatteras in an imperious tone

and since the prayers of a friend will not suffice the
captain commands

  the doctor did not insist longer and a few minutes
later the little band set out accompanied by duk

  it was about eight oclock when they commenced their
difficult ascent the sky was splendid and the ther-
mometer stood at 

  hatteras and his dog went first closely followed by
the others

  i am afraid said johnson to the doctor

  no no theres nothing to be afraid of we arc
here

this singular little island appeared to be of recent
formation and was evidently the product of suc-
cessive volcanic eruptions the rocks were all lying
loose on the top of each other and it was a marvel
how they preserved their equilibrium strictly speak-
ing the mountain was only a heap of stones thrown
down from a height and the mass of rocks which com-
posed the island had evidently come out of the bowels
of the earth

  the earth indeed may be compared to a vast cauldron
of spherical form in which under the influence of a
central fire immense quantities of vapors are generated
which would explode the globe but for the safety-valves
outside

  these safety-valves are volcanoes when one closes
another opens and at the poles where the crust of the
earth is thinner owing to its being flattened it is not
stirpising that a volcano should be suddenly formed by
the upheaving of some part of the ocean-bed

  the doctor while following hatteras was closely
following all the peculiarities of the island and he was
further confirmed in his opinion as to its recent forma-
tion by the absence of water had it existed for
centuries the thermal springs would have flowed from
its bosom

  as they got higher the ascent became more and
more difficult for the flanks of the mountain were al-
most perpendicular and it required the utmost care to
keep them from falling clouds of scorioe and ashes
would whirl round them repeatedly threatening them
with asphyxia or torrents of lava would bar their pas-
sage in parts where these torrents ran horizontally
the outside had become hardened while underneath was
the boiling lava and every step the travelers took had
first to be tested with the iron-tipped staff to avoid
being suddenly plunged into the scalding liquid

  at intervals large fragments of red-hot rock were
thrown up from the crater and burst in the air like
bomb-shells scattering the debris to enormous distances
in all directions

  hatteras however climbed up the steepest ascents
with surprising agility disdaining the help of his staff

  he arrived before long at a circular rock a sort of
plateau about ten feet wide a river of boiiing lava
surrounded it except in one part where it forked away
to a higher rock leaving a narrow passage through
which hatteras fearlessly passed

  here he stopped and his companions managed to re-
join him he seemed to be measuring with his eye the


amazing stories

distance he had yet to get over horizontally he was
not more than two hundred yards from the top of the
crater but vertically he had nearly three times that dis-
tance to traverse

  the ascent had occupied three hours already hat-
teras showed no signs of fatigue while the others were
almost spent

  the summit of the volcano appeared inaccessible and
the doctor determined at any price to prevent hatteras
from attempting to proceed he tried gentle means
first but the captains excitement was fast becoming
delirium during their ascent symptoms of insanity
had become more and more marked and no one could
be surprised who knew anything of his previous his-
tory

  hatteras said the doctor it is enough we can-
not go farther

  stop then he replied in a strangely altered voice
i am going higher

  no it is useless you are at the pole already
  no no higher higher

  my friend do you know who is speaking to you
it is i dr clawbonny

  higher higher repeated the madman

  very well we shall not allow it-that is all

  he had hardly uttered the words before hatteras by
a superhuman effort sprang over the boiling lava and
was beyond the reach of his companions

  a cry of horror burst from every lip for they thought
the poor captain must have perished in that fiery gulf
but there he was safe on the other side accompanied
by his faithful duk who would not leave him

  he speedily disappeared behind a curtain of smoke
and they heard his voice growing fainter in the dis-
tance shouting

  to the north to the north to the top of mount
hatteras remember mount hatteras

  all pursuit of him was out of the question it was
impossible to leap across the fiery torrent and equally
impossible to get round it altamont indeed was
mad enough to make an attempt and would certainly
have lost his life if the others had not held him back
by main force

  hatteras hatteras shouted the doctor but no
response was heard save the faint bark of duk

  at intervals however a glimpse of him could be
caught through the clouds of smoke and showers of
ashes sometimes his head sometimes his arm ap-
peared then he was out of sight again and a few
minuteis later was seen higher up clinging to the
rocks his size constantly decreased with the fan-
tastic rapidity of objects rising upwards in the air
in half an hour he was only half his size

  the air was full of the deep rumbling noise of the vol-
cano and the mountain shook and trembled from time
to time a loud fall was heard behind and the travelers
would see some enormous rock rebounding from the
heights to engulf itself in the polar basin below

  hatteras did not even turn once to look back but
marched straight on carrying his countrys flag attached
to his staff his terrified friends watched every move-
ment and saw him gradually decrease to micro-

scopic dimensions while duk looked no larger than a
rat

  then came a moment of intense anxiety for the wind
beat down on them an immense sheet of flame and
they could see nothing but the red glare a cry of
agony escaped the doctor but an instant afterwards
hatteras reappeared waving his flag

  for a whole hour this fearful spectacle went on-an
hour of battle with unsteady loose rocks and quag-
mires of ashes where the foolhardy climber sank up
to his knees sometimes they saw him hoist him-
self up by leaning knees and loins against the rocks in
narrow intricate winding paths and sometimes he
would be hanging on by both hands to some sharp
crag swinging to and fro like a withered tuft

  at last he reached the summit of the mountain the
mouth of the crater here the doctor hoped the in-
fatuated man would stop perhaps recover his senses
and expose himself to no more danger than the descent
involved

  once more he shouted hatteras hatteras

  there was such a pathos of entreaty in his tone
that altamont felt moved to his inmost soul

  ill save him yet he exclaimed and before claw-
bonny could hinder him he had cleared with a bound
the torrent of fire and was out of sight among the
rocks

  meantime hatteras had mounted a rock which over-
hung the crater and stood waving his flag amidst show-
ers of stones which rained down on him duk was
by his side but the poor beast was growing dizzy in
such close proximity to the abyss

  hatteras balanced his staff with one hand and with
the other sought to find the precise mathematical point
where all the meridians of the globe meet the point on
which it was his sublime purpose to plant his foot

  all at once the rock gave way and he disappeared
a cry of horror broke from his companions and rang
to the top of the mountain clawbonny thought his
friend had perished and lay buried for ever in the
depths of the volcano a second-only a second
though it seemed an age-elapsed and there was alta-
mont and the dog holding the ill-fated hatteras man
and dog had caught him at the very moment when be
disappeared in the abyss

  hatteras was saved saved in spite of himself and
half-an-hour later he lay unconscious in the arms of
his despairing companions

  when he came to himself the doctor looked at him
in speechless anguish for there was no glance of
recognition in his eye it was the eye of a blind man
who gazes without seeing

  good heavens exclaimed johnson he is blind
he cannot see us

  no replied clawbonny no my poor friends we
have only saved the body of hatteras his soul is left
behind on the top of the volcano he is not blind
his reason is gone

  insane exclaimed johnson and altamont in con-
sternation

  insane replied the doctor and the big tears ran
down his cheeks
ihe desert of ice

chapter xxv
return south

three hours after this sad denouement of the
adventures of captain hatteras the whole party
were back once more in the grotto

  clawbonny was asked his opinion as to what was
best to be done

  well friends he said we cannot stay longer in
this island the sea is open and we have enough pro-
visions we ought to start at once and get back with-
out the least delay to fort providence where we must
winter

  that is my opinion too said altamont the
wind is favorable so to-morrow we will get to sea

  the day passed in profound dejection the insanity
of the captain was a bad omen and when they began
to talk over the return voyage their hearts failed
them for fear they missed the intrepid spirit of their
leader

  however like brave men they prepared to battle
anew with the elements and with themselves if ever they
felt inclined to give way

  next morning they made all ready to sail and brought
the tent and all its belongings on board

  but before leaving these rocks never to return the
doctor carrying out the intentions of hatteras had a
cairn erected on the very spot where the poor fellow
had jumped ashore it was made of great blocks
placed one on the top of the other so as to be a land-
mark perfectly visible while the eruption of the vol-
cano left it undisturbed on one of the side stones
bell chiseled the simple inscription

john hatteras

  the duplicate of the document attesting the dis-
covery of the north pole was enclosed in a tinned iron
cylinder and deposited in the cairn to remain a silent
witness among those desert rocks

  this done the four men and the captain a poor body
without a soul set out on the return voyage accom-
panied by the faithful duk who had become sad and
downcast a new sail was manufactured out of the
tent and about ten oclock the little boat sailed out be-
fore the wind

  she made a quick passage finding abundance of open
water it was certainly easier to get away from the
pole than to get to it

  but hatteras knew nothing that was passing around
him he lay full length in the boat perfectly silent
with lifeless eye and folded arms and duk lying at
his feet clawbonny frequently addressed him but
could elicit no reply

  on the th they sighted altamont harbor but as
the sea was open all along the coast they determined to
go round to victoria bay by water instead of crossing
new america in the sled

  the voyage was easy and rapid in a week they ac-
complished what had taken a fortnight in the sled
and on the rd they cast anchor in victoria bay

as soon as the boat was made fast they all hastened
to fort providence but what a scene of devastation



met their eyes doctors house stores powder-maga-
zine fortifications all had melted away and the pro-
visions had been ransacked by devouring animals

  the navigators had almost come to the end of their
supplies and had been reckoning on replenishing their
stores at fort providence the impossibility of win-
tering there now was evident and they decided to get to
baffin bay by the shortest route

  we have no alternative said clawbonny baffin
bay is not more than six hundred miles distant we can
sail as long as there is water enough under our boat
and get to jones sound and then on to the danish
settlements

  yes said altamont let us collect what food re-
mains and be off at once

  after a thorough search a few cases of pemmican
were found scattered here and there and two barrels
of preserved meat altogether enough for six weeks
and a good supply of powder it was soon collected and
brought on board and the remainder of the day was
employed in caulking the boat and putting her in good
trim

  next morning they put out once more to sea the
voyage presented no great difficulties the drift-ice be-
ing easily avoided but still the doctor thought it ad-
visable in case of possible delays to limit the rations
to one-half this was no great hardship as there
was not much work for anyone to do and all were in
perfect health

  besides they found a little shooting and brought
down ducks and geese and guillemots or auks water
they were able to supply themselves with in abundance
from the fresh-water icebergs they constantly fell in
with as they kept near the coast not daring to venture
out in the open sea in so frail a bark

  at that time of the year the thermometer was al-
ready constantly below freezing point the frequent
rains changed to snow and the weather became gloomy
each day the sun dipped lower below the horizon and
on the th for a few minutes it was out of sight
altogether

  however the little boat sailed steadily on they
knew what fatigues and obstacles a land journey in-
volved if they should be forced to adopt it and no
time was to be lost for soon the open water would
harden to firm ground already the young ice had be-
gun to form in these high latitudes there is neither
spring nor autumn winter follows close on the heels
of summer

on the st the first stars glimmered overhead and
from that time forward there was continual fog
which considerably impeded navigation

  the doctor became very uneasy at these multiplied
indications of approaching winter he knew the diffi-
culties sir john ross had to contend with after he left
his ship to try and reach baffin bay and how after all
he was compelled to return and pass a fourth winter on
board it was bad enough with shelter and food and
fuel but if any such calamity befell the survivors oi
the forward if they were obliged to stop or return
they were lost


amazing stories

  the doctor said nothing of his anxieties to his
companions but only urged them to get as far east as
possible

  at last after thirty days tolerably quick sailing and
after battling for forty-eight hours against the in-
creasing drift ice and risking the frail boat a hun-
dred times the navigators saw themselves blocked in
on all sides further progress was impossible for
the sea was frozen in every direction and the ther-
mometer was only  above zero

  altamont made a reckoning with scrupulous pre-
cision and found they were in   latitude and
  longitude

  this is our exact position then said the doctor
we are in south lincoln just at cape eden and are
entering jones sound with a little more good luck we
should have found open water right to baffin bay
but we must not grumble if my poor hatteras had
found as navigable a sea at first he would have soon
reached the pole his men would not have deserted
him and his brain would not have given way under
the pressure of terrible trial

  i suppose then said altamont our only course
is to leave the boat and get by sled to the east coast
of lincoln

  yes but i think we should go through jones sound
and get to south devon instead of crossing lincoln

 why

  because the nearer we get to lancaster sound the
more chance we have of meeting whalers

  you are right but i question whether the ice is
firm enough to make it practicable

  well try replied clawbonny

  the little vessel was unloaded and the sled put
together again all the parts were in good condition so
the next day the dogs were harnessed and they started
off along the coast to reach the ice-field but alta-
monts opinion proved right they could not get through
jones sound and were obliged to follow the coast to
lincoln

  at last on the th they set foot on north devon

  now said clawbonny we have only to cross
this and get to cape warender at the entrance to
lancaster sound

  but the weather became frightful and very cold
the snow-storms and tempests returned with winter
violence and the travelers felt too weak to contend
with them their stock of provisions was almost ex-
hausted and rations had to be reduced now to a third
that the dogs might have food enough to keep them
in working condition

  the nature of the ground added greatly to the fatigue
north devon is extremely wild and rugged and the
path across the trauter mountains is through difficult
gorges the whole party-men and dogs and sled
alike-were frequently forced to stop for they could
not struggle on against the fury of the elements more
than once despair crept over the brave little band hardy
as they were and used to polar sufferings though
scarcely aware of it themselves they were completely
worn out physically and mentally

  it was not till the th of august that they emerged

from those wild mountains into a plain which seemed
to have been upturned and convulsed by volcanic action
at some distant period

  here it was absolutely necessary to take a few days
rest for the travelers could not drag one foot after the
other and two of the dogs had died from exhaustion
none of the party felt equal to put up the tent so they
took shelter behind an iceberg

  provisions were now so reduced that notwithstanding
their scanty rations there was only enough left for one
week starvation stared the poor fellows in the face

  altamont who had displayed great unselfishness and
devotion to the others roused his sinking energies and
determined to go out and find food for his comrades

  he took his gun called duk and went off almost un-
noticed by the rest

  he had been absent about an hour and only once
during that time had they heard the report of his gun
and now he was coming back empty-handed but run-
ning as if terrified

  what is the matter asked the doctor

  down there under the snow said altamont speak-
ing as if scared and pointing in a particular direction

  what

  a whole party of men

  alive

  dead-frozen-and even-

  he did not finish the sentence but a look of unspeak-
able horror came over his face the doctor and the
others were so roused by this incident that they man-
aged to get up and drag themselves after altamont
towards the place he indicated they soon arrived at
a narrow part at the bottom of a ravine and what a
spectacle met their gaze dead bodies already stiff
lay half-buried in a winding-sheet of snow a leg
visible here an arm there and yonder shrunken
hands and rigid faces stamped with the expression of
rage and despair

  the doctor stooped down to look at them more
closely but instantly started back pale and agitated
while duk barked ominously horrible horrible
he said

  what is it asked johnson

  dont you recognize them

  what do you mean

  look and see

  it was evident this ravine had been but recently the
scene of a fearful struggle with cold and despair and
starvation for by certain horrible remains it was mani-
fest that the poor wretches had been feeding on human
flesh perhaps while still warm and palpitating and
among them the doctor recognized shandon pen and
the ill-fated crew of the forward their strength had
failed provision had come to an end their boat had
been broken perhaps by an avalanche or engulfed in
some abyss and they could not take advantage of the
open sea or perhaps they had lost their way in wan-
dering over these unknown continents moreover men
who set out under the excitement of a revolt were not
likely to remain long united the leader of a rebellion
has but a doubtful power and no doubt shandons
authority had been soon cast off

the desert of ice



  be that as it may it was evident the crew had
come through agonies of suffering and despair before
this last terrible catastrophe but the secret of their
miseries is buried with them beneath the polar snows

  come away come away said the doctor drag-
ging his companions from the scene horror gave them
momentary strength and they resumed their march
without stopping a minute longer

chapter xxvi
conclusion

it would be useless to enumerate all the misfortunes
which befell the survivors of this expedition even
the men themselves were never able to give any
detailed narrative of the events which occurred during
the week subsequent to the horrible discovery related in
the last chapter however on the th of september by
superhuman exertions they arrived at last at cape
horsburg the extreme point of north devon

  they were absolutely starving for forty-eight
hours they had tasted nothing and their last meal had
been off the flesh of their last esquimau dog bell
could go no further and johnson felt himself dying

  they were on the shore of baffin bay now half-frozen
over that is to say on the road to europe and three
miles off the waves were dashing noiselessly on the
sharp edges of the ice-field here they must wait their
chance of a whaler appearing and for how long

  but heaven pitied the poor fellows for the very
next day altamont distinctly perceived a sail on the
horizon

  everyone knows the torturing suspense that follows
such an appearance and the agonizing dread lest it
should prove a false hope the vessel seems alternately
to approach and recede and too often just at the very
moment when the poor castaways think they are saved
the sail begins to disappear and is soon out of sight

  the doctor and his companions went through all
these experiences they had succeeded in reaching the
western boundary of the ice-field by carrying and push-
ing each other along and they watched the ship grad-
ually fade away from view without observing them

just then a happy inspiration came to the doctor
his fertile genius supplied him with one last idea

  a floe driven by the current struck against the ice-
field and clawbonny exclaimed pointing to it

  let us embark on this floe

  oh dr clawbonny dr clawbonny said john-
son pressing his hand

  bell assisted by altamont hurried to the sled and
brought back one of the poles which he stuck fast on
the ice like a mast and fastened it with ropes the
tent was torn up to furnish a sail and as soon as the
frail raft was ready the poor fellows jumped upon it
and sailed out to the open sea

  two hours later after unheard-of exertions the sur-
vivors of the forward were picked up by the hans
christian a danish whaler on her way to davis strait
they were more like specters than human beings and
the sight of their sufferings was enough

the

   ten days afterwards clawbonny johnson bell alta-
 mont and captain hatteras landed at a town in
 zealand an island belonging to denmark they took
 the steamer to kiel and from kiel proceeded by
 altona and hamburg to london where they arrived
 on the th of the same month

   the first care of clawbonny was to request the
 royal geographical society to receive a communica-
 tion from him he was accordingly admitted to the
 next seance and one can imagine the astonishment of
 the learned assembly and the enthusiastic applause pro-
 duced by the reading of hatterass document

   the english have a passion for geographical discov-
 ery from the lord to the cockney from the merchant
 down to the dock laborer and the news of this grand
 discovery speedily flashed along the telegraph wires
 throughout the length and breadth of the kingdom hat-
 teras was lauded as a martyr by all the newspapers and
 every englishman felt proud of him

   the doctor and his companions had the honor of be-
 ing presented to the queen by the lord chancellor and
 they were feted and lionized in all quarters

   the government confirmed the names of queens
 island mount hatteras and altamont harbor

   altamont would not part from his companions in
 misery and glory but followed them to liverpool
 where they were joyously welcomed back after being
 so long supposed dead and buried beneath the snows

   but dr clawbonny would never allow that any
 honor was due to himself he claimed all the merit
 of the discovery for his unfortunate captain and in
 the narrative of his voyage published the next year
 under the auspices of the royal geographical society
 he places john hatteras on a level with the most il-
 lustrious navigators and makes him the compeer of all
 the brave daring men who have sacrificed themselves
 for the progress of science

   the insanity of this poor victim of a sublime passion
 was of a mild type and he lived quietly at sten cot-
 tage a private asylum near liverpool where the doc-
 tor himself had placed him he never spoke and un-
 derstood nothing that was said to him reason and
 speech had fled together the only tie that connected
 him with the outside world was his friendship for
 duk who was allowed to remain with him

   for a considerable time the captain had been in the
 habit of walking in the garden for hours accompanied
 by his faithful dog who watched him with sad wist-
 ful eyes but his promenad was always in one direction
 in a particular part of the garden when he got to
 the end of this path he would stop and begin to walk
 backwards if anyone stopped him he would point
 with his finger towards a certain part of the sky but
 let anyone attempt to turn him round and he became
 angry while duk as if sharing his masters sentiments
 would bark furiously

   the doctor who often visited his afflicted friend
 noticed this strange proceeding one day and soon un-
 derstood the reason of it

   this was the secret john hatteras invariably
 faced towards the north

he wind rose in the night and by dawn the
sky was streaming with torn and ragged
masses of cloud moving from south to
north like an army in flight there was a
shiver of cold in the air and the seas ran
so high that effective work was impossible so we
gathered in professor hartfords cabin to help the
old man brave out his discomfort by getting him to
talk the way in which he kept up his spirit if not his
body through all the miseries of seasickness on that
trip was one of the finest exhibitions of courage i have
seen anywhere

  as the senior member of the museums staff he was
in a sense in charge of the expedition though like the
rest of us he was inclined to let things run themselves
while he pursued his specialty perhaps it was for-
tunate for him that the protozoa can be studied as
well on a constantly moving steamer as on dry land
for the work kept his mind off his troubles at all
events every day that was calm enough for him to be
out of bed found him poring over his microscope in
search of hitherto undescribed forms in this remote
corner of the pacific

  on days such as this he lay in his bunk and be-
tween uneasy heavings of the mal-de-mer that plagued
him lectured our crowd of assorted scientific experts
on the importance of unicellular life very inter-
esting lectures they must have been to the other chaps
even i was sometimes caught by the spell of the pro-
fessors keen and philo-
sophical observation and as
a mere artist i always felt
more or less a misfit among
all those -ologies and -isms

  i remember this day in
particular partly because
the evening brought us to
our first view of easter
island and partly because
the conversation turned to
those scientific generaliza-
tions which are both easier
to understand and more interesting to the non-scientific
hearer but even then i probably would have recalled
it only as one of a number of similar talks had not
after events given it a peculiar almost a sinister sig-
nificance

  burgess our entomologist had been trying to riraw
the professor out by descanting on the rising tide of in-
sect life sooner or later he declared we will have
to fight for our lives with them science always plods
along behind their attacks they have taken the chest-
nut the boll-weevil and corn-borer are taking two more

of our economically important plants who knows
but that nature is working in its slow way to send us
after the dinosaurs

  slap slap went the waves against the cabin wall
perhaps perhaps mused professor hertford
though i incline to think that the insects will never
drive man from the planet evolution allows a group
only one opportunity-the insects had their chance to
rule the world in the carboniferous and failed

     no he went on there are many lines of
evolution untried but none of them lead through ex-
isting forms when a more capable type than man
appears it will be in a wholly new form of animal life
-perhaps even a direct evolution from the protozoa
so far as we know evolution along that line has never
taken place to any great extent the division between
the one-celled and many-celled animals is sharper than
that between an insect and an elephant think of a
one-celled animal practically immortal as they are and
possessed of intelligence no matter what work we do
no matter what records we leave the greater portion
of human knowledge perishes with the minds that give
it birth think what it would mean if one person could
go on gathering knowledge through the centuries
but objected burgess a parmoecium hasnt any
brain tissue you cant have that without some ner-
vous organization

  but my dear burgess said the professor ur-
banely is brain tissue necessary to thought you
might as well say fins are
necessary to swimming
neither the polar bear nor
the octopus have them yet
both can swim very well
nature has a queer way of
accomplishing similar re-
sults by all sorts of differ-
ent means suppose thought
is what osborn hints it is-
a matter of chemical reac-
tion and interaction - is
there any need for brain
tissue in which the thought must take place

  all true enough said burgess but you must ad-
mit that without proprioceptors there can be no sensa-
tion and with a cortex-

the conversation became so technical that i was
perforce eliminated from it and wandered down
the iron stairway to watch the engines for a time i
sat there vainly trying to put on paper the flicker of
those bright moving parts-so beautifuuy ordered so
roman in their efficient performance of their task

 faster island has for many years been a subject
 for considerable conjecture though many expeditions
 have traveled there and made intensive investigations no
 definite reasons could be found for the complete lack of
 human existence there are many signs of life having been
 there at some time the statues there remain a mystery
 so docs any reason as to why the area of water and islands
 called the agassiz triangle is so devoid of life

   the co-authors of this story apparently have also zvon-
 dered abut these questions and have developed an original
 explanation of unusual interest
with an indescribably swaying motion the jelly-like mass la the cage seemed to surge through the narrow opening in tha
cage and as it surged the air about it was filled with the flash of those deadly darts i heard howard cry out i saw grimm

amazing stories

whatever else was happening but it was no use a
job for a nevinson and i clambered back to the deck

  there i found the weather had moderated the
whole southwest was streaked with the orange presage
of a fairer day and right in the center of the illumina-
tion grey and ominous a huge cone rose steeply from
the water

  thats puakatina said bronson the mate pausing
beside me theres an anchorage right beneath it
but well have to work round to the west of cooks
bay to get shelter from the wind i was here on a
guano ship ten years ago damndest place you ever
saw-no water no fish no nothing

  morning found us at anchor in the bay and already
scattering to our several pursuits for me easter
island was a fairyland never among primitive work
have i seen such sculpture it far surpassed the best
egyptian work for every one of those cyclopean heads
was a portrait and almost a perfect one i cannot
better express my feeling for them than by saying
that now as i am writing this account with the memory
sharp in my mind of the strange and terrible events
that took place later i must still turn aside to pay
tribute to those statues

  after all they are not so far from my story indeed
it was the statues that gave me what should have been
a clue-a queer idea that all was not quite as it should
be on this island-an idea that i would dismiss as an
afterview were it not that i find on the margin of one
of my sketches made at the time a note to the effect
that something very curious must have happened on
the island those stones were carved by nothing less
than a race of conquerors with stern high faces utterly
different from the easy-going polynesians of today
what became of them

  the same impression of some weird catastrophe was
confirmed by other members of the expedition there
were almost no fish very little life for the botanists to
chew on and hertford announced at one of our cabin
conferences that the waters as agassiz had reported
were quite devoid of plankton he pooh-poohed the
idea of the subsidence of a large land put forth by de
salza our geologist subsidence he said would
leave the plankton and fish untouched it is more as
though some destructive organism had swept every
trace of life from the locality all the birds and the
few fish are obviously recent immigrants like the
people

  despite my entreaties for more time to make sketches
the scientists had done about all they could with this
barren land in a week or so and we hauled up anchor
for sala-y-gomez three hundred miles further east
taking a couple of the islanders with us in spite of
its atmosphere of ruin and gloom i was sorry to
leave easter island but there was the possibility that
sala-y-gomez might contain some traces of the easter
script or carvings and i felt it necessary to refuse
hertfords offer to leave me and stop on the way back

  upon sala-y-gomez too we came just at evening

   plankton-the passively floating or weakly swimming animal
and plant life of a body of water-by some applied chiefly to
the organisms found near the surface webster

marking it by the white line of foam along its low-
lying shores as we felt our way slowly among the
reefs and here occurred another of those trivial inci-
dents which- are straws pointing in the direction of
hidden things

  i was standing by the rail with howard the icthyo-
logical man idly watching the wires of the dredge where
they interrupted the slow curls of water turned back
by our bow when there was a heavy muffled clang
and we saw the lines of the dredge tighten to tensity
howard signalled for it to be drawn in and together
we watched the big scoop eager to see what it had en-
countered to our surprise it held only a little sea-
weed

  now thats odd said howard searching the sea-
weed with a small hand glass i could have sworn
that dredge caught something heavy

  it did i answered pointing there was a long
scratch of bright metal along one side

  corals possibly he remarked hey bronson
any reefs charted here

  the mate strolled up not on the charts he said
but you never can tell these chilean charts arent
very good you know

  m-m-m murmured howard continuing his ex-
amination there ought to be fragments of coralline
formation here but there arent wonder what it
could have been almost as though wed caught
something and it got away

  the thought of hertfords comment about a destruc-
tive organism slipped into my mind to be dismissed as
not worth mentioning rock shark almost anything
would have made that mark on the dredge

  there were no specimens ready to be sketched in
the morning apd i went ashore with the first boat to
wander about the island with my drawing materials
it must have been nearly noon when i rounded a jut-
ting outcrop of rock to see before me a little sandy
cove placid and unresponsive in the heat without a
sign of life far ahead a dark blob of rock was the
only mark on the perfect line of the beach it was
so suave a scene that i sat down to make a sketch
after i had pencilled it in and was mixing the brown
color for the cliffs i noted that the rock seemed to
have moved but i attributed it to imagination and
went on with my coloring it must have been quite
ten minutes when i looked up again this time there
could be no doubt-neither the outline nor the posi-
tion of the rock were at all as i had recorded them

in some excitement i started to climb down the
cliff toward this singular rock that changed place and
form but the distance was considerable and while i
was still a quarter of a mile away it moved again
visibly this time sliding down to the waters edge where
it disappeared beneath the gentle surge the most
peculiar thing about it was that there seemed to be no
sensible method of progress it flowed like a huge ir-
regular drop of liquid

  i hurried back to the camp with my sketch and my
tale but found the rest in no condition to listen old
makoi toa one of the easter islanders we had brought
danger



along with us had been killed apparently by a snake

  he was fishing down the beach ahead of the rest
said howard just out of sight beyond that rock we
all heard him scream and hurried to the spot when
we got there he was already dead with a round hole in
his chest and shortly after he turned that hideous
blue-black that people turn to who die of snake-bite it
might have been one of those sea-snakes but for the
size of the wound

  im sure i saw something sliding away into the
water added greaves the botanist but it didnt look
in the least like a snake

  the shadow of the old mans death lay on our little
cabin conference that night inhibiting speech though
the means of it renamed a mystery it was not until
i told my tale that there was any conversation at all
as i finished there was a little moment of silence dur-
ing which each one made the obvious parallel between
the occurrence and the death of makoi toa and then
professor hertford asked to see my sketch he looked
at it closely for a moment

  unless i am mistaken gentlemen he said we are
facing an unknown organism of serious potentialities
may i ask that you do not go ashore to-morrow unless
you are well armed and in pairs

  what is it professor  asked de salza

  i would prefer not to hazard a guess just yet i
may be in error and that was the last word on the
subject that we could draw from him although de
salza laughed at the idea of anything sinister in con-
nection with this little spot of land

  the next day was bright and clear and after attend-
ing the burial service for makoi toa i sought greaves
and together we made for the spot where i had seen the
moving rock i admit we were culpable in not going
armed as the professor advised but who would then
have thought    

  we reached the place about the same time i had
been there the previous day climbed down the cliffs
with each others help and walked across the white
sand of the cove to where i had seen the moving
rock it was not more than ten yards from the edge
of a place where the receding tide of years had left a
number of little arched caves just where i had
sketched the rock was a ridge of sand pushed aside
by the weight of whatever had been there and in the
center of it a round hard ball perhaps three or four
inches in diameter greaves picked it up turning it
over curiously

  why its feathers and bones he said extending
it to me just as though it had been regurgitated by a
pelican or an eagle after a meal

  i reached my hand for it and just then by the grace
of providence caught a flicker of motion out of the
tail of my eye i turned to meet it my foot gave on
the soft sand and i fell prone it was the fall that
saved me for something sharp whistled not an inch
past my shoulder as i went down the next instant
i heard greaves shout and felt him tug my arm and
in the same moment something cold and clammy and
hard grated and gripped against my foot a horrible
fear the fear of imminent death turned me to ice

i seemed incapable of movement but somehow got to
one knee and between my own efforts and greaves
pull the grip on my foot relaxed i half stumbled
half-rolled down the sand and as i did so there was
another whistling flash and something struck the pocket
of my coat going right through the cloth and the
sketch pad beneath it to fall short of my skin by the
narrowest of margins greaves was pulling me to my
feet and in a moment we were running

  in the interests of science i regret that we stood not
on the order of our going neither of us spoke till
we turned and paused at the top of the cliff after a
breathless climb the cove was as empty as it had
been before

  my god what was it i gasped

  i dont know i dont know greaves was half
sobbing with excitement something big and sort of
-all soft-threw those things at us-half a dozen of
them-my god

we were both so much shaken that the journey
back to the camp seemed interminable and it was
some time after our arrival before a consecutive story
could be gotten out of greaves when he did tell his
tale it appeared that he had noticed the thing almost
as soon as i-a great dead brown object of uncertain
form which had slid up softly from the water and shot
out the darts i had seen without warning or sound
as a cuttlefish does when you touch it said greaves
with a shudder the horrible part about it was that
the thing had no eyes but seemed to see perfectly and
know just where to move to head us off i thought
id never get you pulled loose  all the time i was
dodging those darts i kept thinking about makoi
toa   

  i think you will agree said professor hertford
when he had finished his rather incoherent account
that my anticipations have been realized everything
points to the presence in these waters of an efficient and
destructive organism capable not only of dominating
the whole animal environment but possibly even of de-
populating easter island from your description
which is very rough and inaccurate i should not be
surpised to find it a giant new species of infusorian or
jellyfish both types have those stinging tentacles i
am in favor of remaining until we obtain more data
about this animal but as some-er-danger may attend
such a course i should prefer to leave it to the ma-
jority

  what could we do in the face of such an appeal
personally i had felt the grip on my foot and had no
desire to feel it again i could understand the flame
of scientific interest driving the others but it was
rather with foreboding than enthusiasm that i listened
to the eager plans they made for entrapping one of the
animals which had attacked us

  i doubt whether anybody except de salza who was
a human fish intolerant of anything but the record
of the rocks was absent from the group which gath-
ered behind the top of the cliffs the next morning to
watch the fluttering antics of a chicken pegged out on
the sand where we had met our adventure howard


amazing stories

and grimm the conchologist were armed with the
only two rifles the expedition afforded it having been
agreed that it was better to examine a dead specimen
before trying to take a live one

  the sun grew unconscionably hot as it swung across
the sky we conversed in low tones and were wonder-
ing whether we had come on a wild goose chase when
i saw howard beside me stiffen to attention i looked
around-there was a break in the ripple and through it
slowly emerged the shape of the monster dull brown
in hue i felt a quiver of excitement the chicken was
straining to the limit of its rope there was a crack
that made all of us jump as someone fired no not
yet cried the professor but the dark form took no
notice only moved on formless and flowing with half
a score of short tentacles waving before it then it
appeared to notice the chicken paused waved a tentacle
or two at it and there was a flicking motion as one of
the darts shot out the chicken went limp and the
monster flowed gently over it when it had passed
chicken rope and even the stake were gone

  both men were now firing but they might as well
have been throwing peas the fantastic mound of jelly
rolled back into the water in the same leisurely fashion
it had come out and disappeared

  everybody began to talk at once the thing must
be bullet proof inverterbrate but what arftnverter-
brate so thats what cleaned up easter island
did you notice the ossicles its a hydroid more
like a medusid what do you think dr hertford

  on one thing the conference that followed was
agreed that the animal whatever it was must be cap-
tured and examined various wild suggestions about
dynamite and chemicals came up to be laughed down
and it was dr hertford as usual who supplied the
determining factor

  it seems to me said he that it would be worth
while to postpone our trip to the continent and attempt
to take one of these animals in one of the mammal
cages i believe the one you shot at was at least
seriously injured it seems incredible that it could be
altogether bullet proof we may therefore have a
wait before another appears what do you say

  de salzas was the only dissenting voice i kept
silence i wish i had not for though my protest might
have done little good it would at least have taken a
load from my conscience that can never be quite clear
now however i made no protest the cage was
rigged up on the shore with another chicken inside and
a trick arrangement to slam the door shut on the in-
vader and we sat down at the cove to wait

it was the afternoon of the third day from the instal-
lation of the cage and i was in my tent at the camp
trying to capture the color pattern of a small and very
wiggly fish when the excited voice of howard hailed
us to announce that the cage held a prisoner at once
everything else was forgotten and we all hurried off
pell-mell dr hertford for all his years well in the
lead

  sure enough the little mammal cage was filled to
overflowing with the brown jelly-like mass of the mon-

the

ster a tentacle or two waving in a friendly manner
from the edges of the mass where it bulged between
the bars i admit it gave me a gone reeling in the pit
of the stomach to watch it it was like nothing i had
ever seen or heard of but among the scientists it pro-
duced only the liveliest interest

   warned by previous experience they approached it
with some caution howard carrying a piece of sheet
iron from the ship before the professor like a shield-
bearer in the days of the iliad while greaves and
grimm came behind at a respectable distance bearing
rifles at the ready

   as they drew near i heard the professor cry out in
 excitement why its a protozoan look the nucleus
 and those cilia and the triocysts a single celled
 animal by all thats holy related to loxodes unless
 i am mistaken simultaneously greaves and grimm
 attracted by his words drew a step nearer and even
 howard lowered the sheet iron to peer at the animal
 and in that moment it happened

   with an indescribable swaying motion the jelly-like
 mass in the cage seemed to surge through the narrow
 opening in the cage and as it surged the air about it
 was filled with the flash of those deadly darts i heard
 howard cry out i saw grimm leap a gun was dis-
 charged and the sheet iron clanged on the sand then
 there was silence and the brown mass in the cage oozed
 slowly across the sand to the four dead men who
 writhed for a moment and lay still

   i think i must have gone a little mad in the nexi
moments i can never recall quite accurately what hap-
pened i remember only a paralyzing mist of horror
and the walls of my cabin they tell me that the cove
was found utterly empty save for the cage with its door
shut tight  i do not know  i do not know a
round ball like the gall of feathers and bones found
by greaves was picked up later on the beach it held
shattered human bones a fragment of blue cloth and a
brass key nothing more i did not see it

   even today the memory of the horror of that mo-
ment gives me sleepless nights and days of shuddering
all too clearly i recall the words of that brave and
gentle man who went to his death on the beach of
sala-y-gomez when a type to replace man appears it
will he a direct evolution from the protozoa   all
too clearly i remember his last words and the desola-
tion wrought by these animals on easter island and
through that great stretch of the eastern pacific known
as the agassiz triangle and i wonder how long it will
tie before they invade the continents

   it will be long of that i am certain the length of
 the time makes me wish to forget it and leave the future
 to care for itself but i feel it a duty to the memory
 of dr hertford to lay aside my own feelings and place
 this story before the public especially since de salza
 the only surviving member of that disastrous expedi-
 tion has cast doubt upon his conclusions and has
 disparaged his memory if in the face of a de salzas
 reputation i have succeeded in convincing even a few
 that humanity is on the verge of a battle to the death
 with a perhaps superior form of life i am content
 i have accomplished my purpose

the space hermit

continued from page 

at her looked about for the professor whom i saw en-
gaged in tending a machine in the after end of the ship
and then turned and whispered do you wish to
land

  she nodded eagerly my very soul shuddered when i
saw her nod it seemed that she was broken in spirit
and had no reason to live but only smiled through her
tears and waited patiently for a rescuer i hoped that
her mind had not been affected by the great trial she
had faced i wondered that she appeared so much at
ease perhaps it was through hope perhaps like too
few women she had been alone long enough to dis-
cover within herself her greatest powers

  do not worry-your father shall be safe i whis-
pered again

  she nodded and beamed upon me as i turned away
i knew then what to do i would make arrangements
to land the ship so i went to my room and drew down
the curtains i removed my clothes from my body and
put my shirt and underwear in the pockets of my flying
suit which i put on again then at leisure i tore
the clothes i had removed into strips and tied them to-
gether at the ends by this means i contrived a strong
bandage the width of an inch and about seven feet
long then i took a pair of pliers which were in the
pocket of my flying suit and tore the bolt from my door
no sooner had i succeeded in doing that than the pro-
fessor turned from his work and came down to see me
he talked like a tired weary old man

  i am not so strong as i once was metters i shall
ask your assistance in lifting one of my motors from
its base it will be repaired later-just help me re-
move it

  i felt like a murderer as i followed him out through
the control room to the room where the motors were
located we were in a narrow passageway when i
pinioned his arms to his sides and quickly tied the cord
before he could wrench himself from my grasp i bent
his body and wrapped the cord about his feet i se-
cured him and lay him on the deck but i could not
face him i heard him breathing quick and short as a
man meeting certain death and then he said you are
a traitor i should not have trusted you

  it was necessary i said and then i looked into his
face it was the face of a man who awaited a tragedy
-in his case obviously his return to earth

  never he hissed never metters shall you take
me back to your hateful world my daughter-

  his voice fell short he tried to wrench his hands
free but only succeeded in rising to a sitting posture
he tried to speak but he failed

later when i was still working over him glorie came
to my side she fell beside him weeping it was the
first time i heard her voice

  it was his heart miss hedron i said
it must have been she answered tearfully i-
i saw you bind him-i do not believe you wished to
injure him

  i put my arm about her and guided her into the
main cabin i did not wish to discuss matters with her
i pulled down the elevator lever and turned on the
power thirty minutes later i looked through the
darkness to see the lights of what appeared to be a
small town i called glorie who stood waiting and
glancing back at the body of her father she followed
me aft to a door that had been sealed for three years
i took my pliers and wrenched the seal from the latch
and opened it

  when i strike land you must jump miss hedron

i	directed i will follow immediately after you
  but you will let the ship go again  she asked

  if you wish i told her caring only to be on land
please do it belonged to him-he wished to be
buried in the air-that way

  it was the end of my cruise on the glorie i
pulled the ship to level a few feet from the ground
and then dipped her until i felt her strike i saw
glorie jump from the door i closed the door of the
engine room where the body lay and quickly followed
her the moment i touched ground i saw the great
phantom heave and lift into the void back to the upper
strata back to the sky where she belonged bearing her
dead burden it was then that i wished i had secured
the formula for making the metal of which that ship
was built but i was concerned with something still
more important glorie stood waiting for me she
was like a helpless child and still is for the world is
strange to her

  we went into the town which proved to be a village
in canada and wired my bank for funds upon receipt
of which we started out for los angeles my home
we have been on earth two weeks i do not know
what will come of our adventure suffice to say i am
trying to make the world believe our story which has
been proved to many beyond doubt my hamilton
was found in the northern part of the state sails
is backing me up but a certain newspaper is trying to
make light of our story it may mean that i must
again cruise through the upper strata and search for
the great glorie despite the fact that i have sails
and the builders daughter to bear me out but i do

it must have been his heart i loosed his bonds and
bathed his head in cold water nothing seemed to
help i could not bring him back to life an hour

not know i have a certain feeling of responsibility
for glorie and a great respect for her wishes-and i
am therefore inclined to let the craft remain up there
in the ether a glass tomb of the strangest and greatest
scientist the world ever produced

the end
purple death

 by jack barnette

oung doctor bernard grey spent many
hours bending over his microscope study-
ing intently the bits of life that its lens
made visible to his eye usually his lens
was trained on a few of the spiral shaped
microbes discovered in  by the german zoologist
schaudinn schaudinn named these microbes spiro-
cheta pallida and proved that they were the cause of
that dread social disease that is the reward of sin

  grey knew that schaudinn had discovered these pale
germs that darted and corkscrewed their way across
their little world beneath his lens he knew of the work
of paul ehrlich he had read of ehrlichs eight years
search for something to kill trypanosomes-those wrig-
gling finned devils who if one includes all branches
of their family are the cause of the dread sleeping
sickness nagana and other diseases he knew of david
bruces lifetime battle with the trypanosomes and with
the glossina morsitans and glossina palpalis-tsetse fly
carriers of nagana and sleeping sickness

  grey idolized those men whose life history was re-
corded in paul de kruifs book microbe hunters
which held a prominent place on his desk he like
the brilliant ehrlich dreamed of conquering trypano-
somes and the spirochetes that schaudinn claimed were
closely related to them he had in his few years of
practice administered many doses of  or salversan
which was the fruit of
ehrlichs years of research
and he knew that though
salversan saved thousands
from death insanity or
worse - it occasionally
killed seemingly without
reason

  ehrlich had searched for
a dye that would be harm-
less to man but would kill
the microbes that attack
man grey in this day of
the ultra-violet ray sought a
the same thing

  see see he would say to his friends if i could
find a ray that would kill microbes without in any way
affecting the human body-i could cure any germ dis-
ease i could cut an artery insert a curved quartz tube
in such a manner that the blood would continue to flow
through the artery by way of my tube then while
the heart pumped the blood through the tube my ray
-focused on the tube-would in a short time free the
blood of microbes perhaps the ray would be power-

ful enough to pass through the body-x-rays do-then

i	need not cut at all just by exposing the patient to
the ray i could free his entire body of microbes

  greys laboratory was a maze of apparatus a hodge-
podge of all kinds of lamps and projectors he tried
all kinds of rays on the germ cultures on his micro-
scope slides and on inoculated white mice and guinea-
pigs he found that two frequencies in the ultra-
violet range would kill a few of the weaker microbes
but the infinitely small thin curved tubercle bacilli the
spirochetes the trypanosomes and other of the more
hardy and malignant germs were not in the least dis-
turbed by these rays and they killed greys mice and
guinea-pigs

  grey however was not discouraged he had a good
practice that supplied him with money his rich friend
george le brun an electrical wizard who spent his
time designing and building outlandish apparatus for
greys experiments and getting hilariously drunk on
the contents of a well stocked pre-prohibition cellar
aided and encouraged him

  greys day of days was coming-or perhaps it would
be better to say his night of nights le brun had put
the finishing touches on an odd piece of apparatus in-
tended to permit the variation of the vibratory fre-
quency of the rays given off by a new tube which he had
designed and had that day received from a company
which specialized in making
that kind of experimental
apparatus he worked un-
til after midnight installing
this new tube which looked
like an x-ray tube that had
suffered from convulsions

  grey and le brun looked
forward to the trial of the
tube the next day won-
derful things were expected
of this new apparatus and
though they had often been
disappointed they were very anxious to test the new
ray

  now it chanced that the next day was friday the
thirteenth all sensibly superstitious people know that
friday is an unlucky day and nothing new should be
attempted or started on that day and when it chances
to be that friday is also the thirteenth-then anything
begun on that day is doubly certain to turn out wrong
perhaps le brun and grey were not sensibly super-
stitious or maybe they felt that the trial of this new
tube was mere routine-just another attempt to find

 lj ere again is a different sort of a story-different as
  it is unusual and as unusual as it is excellent we
 know so little about our unknown and little investigated rays
 and waves that almost anything seems possible

   quite recently dr coolidge of the great electric com-
 pany experimented zvith a new ray by means of which
 startling experiments were made these rays changed the
 color of a rabbits hair the subject is given in science
 and invention december  p  with numerous illus-
 trations and with a full description of the details

amazing stories

that elusive something for which they had already spent
two years searching

  friday the thirteenth dawned through a sullen driz-
zling rain that was to last all day nine oclock found
them both in greys laboratory grey had arranged
with a colleague to handle his practice for the next few
days had instructed his secretary that he was not un-
der any circumstances to be disturbed and he and le
brun had locked themselves in the little two-room build-
ing in the rear of his house this building contained
greys study and laboratory

both the doctor and le brun were visibly excited
as they stepped into the lead-sheathed x-ray con-
trol booth in which the control boards for all the ap-
paratus were located

  a switch clicked-a knob turned beneath le bruns
fingers and while grey and le brun watched through
the thick window of the booth a pale blue halo grew
around the tube swiftly it changed to a deep purple
haze that crept and writhed like smoke in a faint breeze
le brun cut off the current and the purple haze died
out grey left the booth and placed a cage containing
some white mice and a guinea-pig directly beneath the
le brun tube where they would be fully exposed to
the el rays they had decided to name the tube
after le brun who designed it and its rays after the
first letter in his name el grey then returned to the
protection of the control booth-they did not know
what effect the rays of the le brun tube would have
on animal life

  for two hours the sinister creeping purple haze
crawled over the surface of the le brun tube and its
rays poured down upon the guinea-pig and mice as they
sat blinking at the strange light

  grey and le brun carefully examined the mice and
guinea-pig but they seemed to be absolutely unaffected
by the el-rays satisfied that the rays were harmless
to animal life and therefore to themselves they began
to turn the rays upon germ cultures

  the day passed quickly and neither le brun nor
grey thought of lunch their ray was killing germs
the longer the exposure the more germs it killed the
blood of a guinea-pig which grey had inoculated with
tubercle bacilli some weeks before-showed only dead
microbes after the guinea-pig had been exposed to the
purple light for two hours watching germ cultures
through the lens of their microscopes le brun and
grey could see a sudden cessation of activity among
the wee creatures they would fade and die only the
hardy wriggling trypanosomes and their virulent cous-
ins the spirochetes continued their activity stubbornly
refusing to pay any attention to the rays from the le
brun tube

  grey and le brun stopped to eat about half past
seven that friday evening but were back at work in
an hour it was about eleven oclock just as they
wrere about to stop for a little well-earned rest that
grey-watching a germ culture of spirochetes through
his microscope-picked up a tiny ultra-violet ray pro-
jector and directed its beam scarcely as large as a
pencil at the slide on the stage of his microscope

  as he watched through the microscope the microbes
and slide disappeared grey tired and sleepy annoyed
because he thought his lens were out of focus swore
softly a glance however showed that the slide was
gone that half of the stage and the substage condenser
were also missing grey swore again-this time in
sheer amazement the ultra-violet ray projector in
his hand was sending its invisible ray at the slate top
of his laboratory table grey glanced at it and then
pointed it at a tiny test tube of water the test tube
and its contents vanished grey pointed the projector
at the wall and a black line marked the course of the
beam as it moved across it by this time grey was
far too amazed to swear

  le brun-at another table-was unaware of what
was happening grey switched off the projector and
stood thinking he had used that ray projector a hun-
dred times before and it had never caused any such
extraordinary occurrences as these must have been
the combination of the two rays perhaps it only
made things invisible he moved his hand through the
space where the test tube had been but touched nothing
he walked across to the wall and examined the gash
that the beam of ultra-violet light had left in it-a
clean cut through the composition wall board to the
hollow tile of which the wall was made returning
to the table he placed a cage containing a white mouse
on the slate top of the table pointed the ultra-violet
ray projector at the slate top switched it on and moved
it in an arc that crossed the cage and the head of the
mouse the cage was cut in twain as if by an invisible
knife the head of the mouse vanished and its quiv-
ering body lay bleeding on one side of the cage a
few more passes of the little ultra-violet ray projector
and both mouse and cage had vanished as if under the
influence of a magicians wand

  going to the control booth grey shut off the le
brun tube turning to watch it as the purple glow faded
then he went into his study and brought out some white
mice that were in there he placed one of the mice
on the slate table-top and turned the ultra-violet ray
projector on it the mouse scurried around wrinkling
his nose at his surroundings quite unharmed by the
ultra-violet rays shutting off the projector he put
the le brun tube into operation again then directed
the rays of the little projector at the mouse the mouse
vanished instantly

  gone were all thoughts of microbes grey was like
a child with a new and wonderful toy

  look george he called to le brun who was
tinkering with some apparatus

  in a minute-soon as i get this vibrator adjusted
damn your vibrators and coils man i have just
made the greatest discovery of the century

  le brun dropped his tools and hastened to grey
under the rays from his tube and the little ultra-violet
ray projector he watched grey send more mice and a
couple of guinea-pigs into nothingness a steel bar
was instantly severed then by passing the ray along the
bar grey caused it to follow the mice and guinea-pigs

  just think he said to le brun imagine what a
step forward this will be in surgery-in mechanics i
the purple death



can amputate a limb instantly compared to this an oxy-
acetylene cutting torch is as slow as a cold chisel and
hammer would be compared to the torch

  imagine it in warfare-a beam of the el-rays from
your tube and a beam of ultra-violet rays sending an
army into eternity an invisible knife that would cut
airplanes or battleships in twain as if they were made
of cheese so far slate and clay are the only things
that i have found to be impervious to it

  its wonderful amazing unimaginable but i cant
understand it grey why does the ultra-violet ray
cut only when in combination with the el-rays  where
do the mice and guinea-pigs go  they leave no smoke
visible gas or any odor so they do not burn they sim-
ply vanish it must instantaneously reduce them to
atoms perhaps to the protons and electrons of which
the atom is composed according to bohr

  yes i suppose so lets go to bed my head is
in a whirl to-morrow i must experiment to find how

i	may use this discovery for surgical operations

  that night grey dreamed of performing all kinds
of surgical operations on the inside of the body with-
out making any incisions he awoke with a vague
memory of using the two rays in the form of tiny
beams to perform those dream operations he under-
stood how he could remove-say an appendix-by
causing the two rays to cross each other just at the
appendix but he could not remember how in his
dreams he had been able to see the rays inside the body
or how he had completed the operations after remov-
ing the offending organs

  outside the sky was heavily overcast but the rain
had stopped it was half past eight and the house-
keeper had breakfast ready grey woke le brun and
they snatched a light breakfast and hurried across the
yard to the laboratory

in the laboratory a few more mice and guinea-pigs
passed away beneath the combination of rays a cat
and a dog lost their tails under the rays went metals
wood liquids paper bakelite everything that grey
could lay his hands on and all except a bit of concrete
articles made of clay and the slate of greys table-top
vanished

  about noon the clouds broke away and the sun shone
brightly the first intimation that grey and le brun
had that all was not well was given by a strong draft
of air and a crash of glass and wood as a part of the
window and its framework disappeared and the rest fell
into the laboratory

  grey failing to comprehend what was happening
rushed to the window the sunlight streaming through
the hole where the window had been made a large
square of light on the concrete floor of the laboratory
into this square of sunlight grey rushed tried to stop
and turn at the same time shrieking to le brun
shut off the tube-ultra-violet rays in sunli-
ahhh

  even as le brun looked greys legs bathed in sun-
light from the knees down vanished and the upper
portion of his body turning away from the window
under the impulse of the effort made as he stepped

into the square of sunlight fell into the sunlight that
entered the window at an angle from above and it too
disappeared vanished-with the lower portion always
going first so that le bruns last glimpse of his friend
was of his head face contorted in agony and amaze
falling toward the floor yet vanishing before it touched
hurled into nothingness just as the mice and guinea-
pigs had been by the rays from the le brun tube and
ultra-violet rays ultra-violet rays from that greatest
of all ultra-violet ray generators-the sun

  rushing to the control booth le brun shut off the
tube that bore his name then as full realization of
the tragedy came to him he fled from the laboratory

  perhaps it would be best to say that he started to
flee from the laboratory for as he rushed from the little
building into the sunlight he too was hurled into eter-
nity even as grey had been mandy greys colored
housekeeper who was coming across the yard to call
them to lunch vowed ever afterward that

  mistuh le bruns ghos rushed out ob de do and
vanished right befo mah naked eyes

  what grey and le brun had failed to learn was
that the rays from their new tube caused some intan-
gible change in matter that made it susceptible to dis-
solution by the ultra-violet rays for an indefinite period
and not as they believed only while under the combined
influence of both rays grey died because he failed
to remember that the sun radiated ultra-violet rays

  mandys version of le bruns death gave the little
building a reputation of being haunted the experi-
ence of the hard-boiled but surprisingly superstitious
policeman who while investigating the disappearance
of grey and le brun found greys notebook and
stepped into the sunlight to read it-only to have it
vanish from between his fingers-served to add
credence to wild rumors concerning the place further
corroboration was given by the hair-raising experience
of the four workmen hired by greys sister to remove
the furnishings from the laboratory and study

  these men filled with forebodings by the tales told
about the laboratory were rather shaky at first but
regained their confidence as they removed greys desk
couch books chairs and other effects from the study
joking as they entered the laboratory they removed
the le brun tube apparatus-a mass of tubes coils
meters and other electrical eamipment mounted on a
huge bakelite panel this apparatus weighed well over
a quarter of a ton and taxed the combined strength
of the four of them to carry it out through the study
they staggered with their unwieldy burden out on the
sidewalk and into the sunlight then a moment of
awed silence-the mass of apparatus had disappeared
leaving them empty handed the four men stood re-
garding the empty space between them for a second or
two then with one accord they turned and fled incon-
tinently bumping into other pedestrians who turned
to hurl curses after them

  this ended all attempts to remove the contents of
the laboratory the place was shunned except for the
occasional venturesome fellow who with his scalp
tingling and with cold chills chasing each other up and
down his spine would creep into the study just to im-

and then into a ruin

  heavy storms ripped the slates from the roof and
today only a ruin of crumbling walls remains as a

and to their strange discovery

interplanetary stories

editor amazing stories

  amazing stories is a very interesting magazine
it is in fact about the only story magazine that
does interest me at all all the stories are inter-
esting but in particular i am interested in inter-
planetary travel stories why i do not know
most of them are such impossible imaginations of
their writers-huge beasts highly developed in-
tellectual animals or insects and other impossible
 things and above all most of the writers
have no idea of how it is done or else they use
the goddard rocket

  but to get down to cases-i have spent several
hours today going over these stories trying to dig
out of them something of benefit as a starting point
and it is not there

 rices ray by harry martin january 
this writer apparently assumes that gravity is like
a current of electricity and can be increased if a
perfect conductor can be found granting that
such is the case it is not a safe method of travel
and i do not believe it

  sub-satellite by chas cloukey march 
rocket principle

  skylark of space by smith and garby august
 the best interplanetary story ever written
the science in it is beyond criticism except for
the method of propulsion x always means
unknown so at the beginning they fail and
atomic power is doubled by some authorities this
story illustrates the necessity of control of gravity
itself as this would eliminate the danger of large
planets or dead suns

 ambassador from mars by harl vincent
september  just a story as far as space
traveling is concerned

 goddard rocket

 moon men by frank brueckel november
 stay with it frank at least you have
tried to explain your method but guess again
centrifugal force explains the action of a whirl-
pool

  flight to venus by edwin k sloat december
 goddard rocket

 memos by henry james february  god-
dard rocket

 the second swarm by j schlossel quar-
terly vol  no  a big story full of guess
work with some possibilities but no method of
travel that even looks possible

  the gravity king by clelland j ball quar-
terly vol  no  the right idea but no at-
tempt at details do a little studying c j you
cant make a scientific story without science

 ralph  c  by hugo gernsback quar-
terly vol  no  a good story full of science
and at that science that will very probably become
reality in the future but how about the gyro-
scopic principle for overcoming gravity the prin
ciple of the gyroscope is one of opposition to rotary
motion and not to movement of the machine as a
whole this cannot be used to overcome gravity

  so much for those who write better interplanetary
stories than i can even imagine my analysis is
only to find something which might lead to a
practical application all the methods suggested
look like so many mirages to me with the excep-
tion of the goddard rocket and even the scien-
tists admit that it is not practical in its present
state due to the lack of a sufficiently powerful
explosive

  lets conquer gravity first then we can go to
any planet we wish to large or small with safety
when we can eliminate gravity so an object will
float in the air no matter what its density then
we will not need to worry about power

 how is it to be done well my guess is as
good as the next one by the proper application
of electricity perhaps not the electricity as we
know but some form of what we call static elec-
tricity what makes ones hair stand on end
when he passes under a large belt that is statically
charged you say static electricity its attract-
ive force overcomes gravity when we can take
such a fact as this and reverse its action perhaps
we may conquer gravity it is worth thinking
about

 i am cataloguing all possible methods and as
soon as i can get to them i intend to try them out

  if there is any one with me in this attempt i
will give them the result of my work

  give us all the interplanetary stories you can
especially if they even hint at how it may be done

  interplanetary stories involve what seem to be
impossibilities the distances are so great that
acceleration of such a high degree would be re-
quired to get the travelers in their vessel going
at adequate speed but they would be almost crushed
and perhaps killed by the action of the acceleration
on their bodies if mr goddard had ever ven-
tured to go off in his rocket we doubt if he would
have been killed by the descent-we think the
acceleration would have taken care of that feature
but many of our readers want these stories they
have a nice touch of science about them so that
we feel that it is our part to continue giving them
in our columns-editor

the ascent of a balloon and
time travelers

editor amazing stories

  it is certainly unnecessary for me to express
my enjoyment in reading your wonderful publi-
cation-although i do believe the magazine is
worthy of being printed on a better grade paper

  einsteins theory of gravity has set me to think-
ing about gravity-i would like you to assist me
if possible with the little problem confronting
me it does not refer to einsteins theory
directly

  gravity i understand has hitherto been ac-
cepted as being entirely separate from air pressure
am i not right

  newton said why does it fall -heres a new
one-why does a lighter than air balloon go
up

  what has the air pressure to do with the gravity
not pulling the balloon down

  yes water floats objects that displace their
weight but that is because the pressure of the
water is more than the pressure of the air and
mainly because the pressure is from beneath the
object but in the air-the pressure is from above
as well as from below

  as an experiment-an object placed in a vacuum
is still attracted by gravity why then is not the
lighter than air balloon attracted the same way
when the air pressure outside the balloon presses
on all sides the same surely air pressure does
not hold the balloon up for is it not pressed down
as much as up can it possibly be that the earth
pushes away a lighter than air object but this
cannot be so-for when the balloon reaches a cer-
tain height it rises no more please explain this
for me

  in reference to your time stories suppose a
man at  p m february th was sitting at his
table writing then on some future date he
travels back through time to february th  p m
he would meet himself would he not but on
february th at  p m if he did not meet him-
self how in the world could he at some future
date have come back through time then or lets
take the future suppose a man say in  had
perfected a time machine and proceeded through
time and arrived here in  and then he re-
turned to  would that mean that at night
this very minute in  that same man is living
in  but how could that be when that man
is not living at this minute right this minute
he perhaps lies rotted to dust

  i	hope i have made my points clear-they are
difficult to explain

 pressure but it is gravity which makes the at-
 mosphere press on all objects the pressure which
 air exerts on any surface depends on the distance
 of that subject from the earth as it is a fluid
 it presses equally in all directions at the same
 levels the top of a balloon is further from the
 earth than its bottom the air presses up against
 the bottom of the balloon with more pressure
 than it exerts in a downward direction on the
 upper surface therefore the balloon ascends it
 is exactly the same as holds in the case of a float-
 ing body immersed in water the water presses
 down upon the immersed object less than it presses
 upwards against it and hence the object rises as
 the balloon rises the air becomes lighter so that
 after a while it reaches the place where it is in
 equilibrium the air presses it up as it did be-
 fore but the air is so light that it does not press
 it upward enough to make it rise any more we
 admit cheerfully your objections to the possibility
 of man traveling in time without involving con-
 tradictions but the topic does give good stories

   we welcome stories by new writers-editor

suggestion for the formation of a
correspondence club

 editor amazing stories

   it seems to me that it would be a good plan if
 the readers of amazing stories would form a
 correspondence club

   we often see letters in the discussions col-
 umn which we would like to answer yet to send
 them to the magazine means at least a months
 wait to carry on a debate or discussion by such
 means would be impractical since two months would
 elapse between question and answer

   now if several people took it into their heads
 to write to the author of one letter he would have
 some trouble answering all i would suggest
 that the letters be numbered anyone desiring to
 answer one could then write to the editor for the
 address of the author the editor would give this
 to the first three inquiring lets say there would
 then be no danger of swamping one person

   there seems to be a deal of discussion over the
 cover this is a minor detail constant readers
 will not give up the magazine because of its outer
 appearance why do they raise such a flutter

g joseph griffin

 north fifth st philadelphia pa

   whenever possible we give the full address of
 the writers and it is almost a hope with us that
 this ystem of giving the address will lead to
 private correspondence do not hesitate to write
 to these friends of ours and we are sure they
 will be very pleased to get your letters

   the cover of amazing stories may be con-
 sidered a minor detail but we can assure you
 that a great deal of thought is lavished on it
 and we are convinced that it would be poor policy
 to change the cover except by very slow degrees
 we cannot afford to lose readers who are familiar
 with amazing stories-editor

  some words from new zealand

 editor amazing stories

    i hope you will be pleased to hear from a reader
  at this long distance your magazine is attractive
  in cover and in the general thrilling nature of its
  yarns the authors of the stories must have won-
  derful imaginations something like the author of
  the swiss family robinson fourth dimension
  has one stumped however interludes help

    keep amazing stories in the press they do
 not have to be scientific always to be true to the
 name of the magazine some yarns of egypt would
 be welcome give the u s a a rest if you want
 to keep foreign readers each story practically is
 in yankee territory with very few exceptions

    with all your science few stories give any idea
  of human clairvoyance telepathy and theropeutical
  hypnotism it is all mechanically done why

    by the way if the hero of the skylark story
 really carried a pound of radium in his pocket i
 pity him

                 tasman t lovell
  co y m c a wellington new zealand
  comments from the antipodes are always very
  welcome madagascar africa south america
  the arctic regions the antarctic regions have all
  figured in many of our stories and certainly the
  interplanetary stories have their scene in the most
  foreign kind of lands

   a pound of radium would be a disagreeable
 pocket companion unless it were adequately
 shielded and that of course would make it quite
 heavy but perhaps the author forgot to tell us
 about the metal that lined that pocket-editor

they could hardly believe their
own ears-when i switched to
ground wave reception

    its no use trying to listen in tonight
 said bill as i took his hat jane and i
 tried to get reception during dinner but all
 we got was static its usually this way-
 just the night they broadcast paul white-
 mans band or some other good program its
 spoiled by howls and fading

    perhaps my set will do a little better i
 suggested i had a surprise in store for him

   he looked doubtful as i turned on the set
 switch i had left my old aerial antenna
 attached on purpose and soon the room was
 filled with an ear-splitting excuse for music
 manipulation of the dials only served to
 make it worse occasionally it faded out
 altogether then the howls would start up
 again until my wife finally shouted turn
 that thing off-its terrible

    satisfied i laughed and disconnecting the old
  aerial and ground wires i then attached the
  lead-in wires of my new underground antenna
  which i had installed just before dinner now
  listen i commanded

the thrilling test

 as though by magic the sweet high notes of
 violins and the stirring sobbing of saxophones
 brought bill to his feet jane looked dumb-
 founded the static was so greatly reduced that
 we hardly noticed it we were getting one of
 the years best programs with scarcely any
 trouble on a wild stormy night

 you see i explained later to bill i
 buried my new underground aerial about two
 feet below the ground where
 wind and storms cant affect it
 so easily they call this thing
 subwave-aerial and its in-
 sulated some way to keep out
 interference and noise its
 combined with a scientific

 found so im sure now that
 have the correct ground con-
 nection all this isnt costing
 me any more than my old
 aerial antenna and ill never
 need to touch it again its
 guaranteed for  years

 hardly necessary to say
 that bill went home with the
 name and address of the sub-
 wave-aerial manufacturers in
 his pocket

 name

into the green prism

  editor amazing stories

    i want to tender joint congratulations to you
  your publication and to one of your authors mr
  a hyatt verrill

    there have been very few issues of amazing
  stories which i have missed there have been
  still fewer of its stories that have failed to give
  me more than pleasure in the reading but the
  last story by mr verrill into the green prism
  has surpassed them all

    in my humble opinion it is a masterpiece of
  literature in every respect its composition is
  impeccable it is the acme of imagination tem-
  pered by a broad knowledge of varied subjects
  and above all else it is something that makes us
  stop and think most of us in a vague sort
  of way know that under the microscope there
  are undreamed of wonders-wonders that have no
  place in our common every day life except as
  we occasionally think of microbes or bacteria
  mr verrill brings to us the thought that which
  in its infinite wisdom was able to create every-
  thing as we know it the universe in its vast
  intricate system its varied flora and fauna
  from its most gigantic to its smallest microscopic
  size may have been for reasons or from causes
  unknown to us created on a scale so vast or
  so minute as to be beyond the limits of human
  realization

    we are incapable of conceiving a race of human
  beings our equals physically and mentally
  dwarfed to the size of those portrayed by mr
  verrill still is there anyone who with authority
  can say it is impossible improbable i grant
  still when we say impossible we place ourselves
  on a higher creative plane than that which did
  create what is as we know it

    there is only one criticism i have to make to
  mr verrills into the- green prism it is
  reminiscent of a story published several years ago
  entitled the lady or the tiger name of author
  forgotten

    there is i believe in practically all of us
  even the most mundane and prosaic a streak of
  sentiment that causes us to rebel at an incom-
  plete romance such as the lady or the tiger
  or into the green prism

    instead we want to see the romance brought
  to a happy culmination therefore i suggest
  mr verrill through don alfeo will make dis-
  coveries that will enable us to know ramon suc-
  ceeded in his attempt to join his sumak nusta

    failing in this he leaves incomplete the play
  of human emotions he has so ably portrayed

    it is like stopping in the middle of a stanza of
  exquisite sweet music it leaves us waiting ex-
  pectant for that which we know should follow but
  which somehow we have lost

    again my heartiest congratulations to mr ver-
  rill keep it up

    regarding the controversy that has been raging
  in the discussions department about the cover
  designs

    personally it was this that first brought amaz-
  ing stories to my attention and caused me to
  purchase my first issue and why not

    its stories are out of the ordinary they are
  amazing stories of things beyond the pale of
  every-day life so why not have the cover con-
  form with the contents amazing

    to change it to make it drab and commonplace
  would be like putting a super-and priceless engine
  in the chassis and under the hood of a pile of
  junk then expect people to marvel at something
  they could not see

    leave them as they are or if they tnust be
  changed then make them more amazing

c e foster

     riverside avenue jacksonville florida

    we are very glad to publish your letter anent
  mr verrills idyllic story about the little manabi
  indians to be good a story as a rule should
  picture distinctive characters and mr verrill cer-
  tainly gives us a good characterization of the two
  main actors from beginning to end the story has
  atmosphere mr verrill is an explorer and is
  very familiar with jungle life in south america

    you speak favorably we are glad to see of the
  name of our magazine and of its cover amazing
  stories has made a very great success and has
  a large circulation and it would e a very critical
  matter to change the name which is now getting
  to be a household word among a large circle of
  readers as regards the cover pages our effort
  will be to make them at once correct and artistic
  correctness is essential for so much is in them that
  is scientific in the way of apparatus and pre-
  historic plants and animals and the present day
  features of the universe have also to be taken
  care of the lady or the tiger is about the
  most famous story of the humorous writer francis
  richard stockton it appeared in -editor

the microscopic rain in into the
green prism the lorentz-
fitzgerald contraction

  editor amazing stories

   a chance purchase of amazing stories has
 made me much interested in the magazine cer-
 tainly when i saw its hair-raising title i did not
 anticipate that it would give its readers much sci-
 entific knowledge the reading of its pages proved
 my surmise to be incorrect but made me think
 that it would be an advisable idea to change the
 name to scientifiction i think it was the bril-
 liant cover illustrations of paul that first drew
 my attention to the magazine

   may i say that some of your authors occa-
 sionally make grave mistakes there is one which
 i have particularly noted in your april issue
 where mr a hyatt verrill writing of the micro-
 scopic men made visible with the green prism
 states that each molecule would appear to this
 race as a great cloud he also states that the
 microscopic spray which bounces off the sand
 grains would fall upon them as a gentle shower
 now in our own world the volume of a drop of
 rain water is nearly infinitesimally small in com-
 parison with a great cloud in the heavens it
 directly follows therefore that if everything were
 proportionately smaller in the world of these
 dwarfed humans the drops of rain falling in their
 streets would be nearly infinitesimally small in
 comparison with the great cloud above them
 when we consider that in this case the great
 cloud is but a molecule of water and that were
 it at all subdivided it would be decomposed into
 its hydrogen and oxygen atoms it is quite clear
 that rain could not fall upon the territory of these
 microscopic beings

    relative to the lorentz-fitzgerald law of con-
  traction would it not be possible that a persoi
  traveling in a machine through space at an ex-
  tremely high speed would not notice any difference
  in his surroundings since according to this
  law objects in motion contract in the dimension
  coinciding with their path i think it highly prob-
  able that this contraction would also apply pro-
  portionately to the fine network of nerves which
  makes up the retina of the eye the altered fo-
  cussing thus obtained of distorted objects might
  make the observers surroundings appear normal

at present i have no more to write and con-
clude with best wishes for the future success of
amazing stories or shall i say scientifiction

    we hope and are quite sure that you will cease
  filling the role of chance purchaser and that you
  will be one of our regular readers amazing
  stories has made a great reputation under its
  title and with its distinctive cover pages and it
  would be a delicate matter to change either feature
  it is hardly fair to say as you do that a drop of
  rain water is infinitesimally small in comparison
  with the great cloud in the heavens in many
  cases where the cloud is big enough your remark
  might apply but it takes an astonishingly small
  quantity of water to make a cloud

   it seems to us that mr verrill took no more
 than quite pardonable license in his treatment of
 the rain showers in the manabi land

   we may have more to say in these columns on
 the lorentz-fitzgerald contraction but it is hard
 to say what would happen if one were to travel
 so fast as to be subjected to an appreciable ex-
 tent to this contraction-editor

a family strife to get amazing
stories

  editor amazing stories

    we are enjoying the amazing stories magazine
  in our home but i am very sorry to say that i
  have one complaint to make

    this home and fireside has always been a very
  peaceful place but of late there have been daily
  stampedes and raids to gain possession of amazing
  stories magazine and drastic action is being
  taken to preserve peace there are  casualties
  to date

    we seem to derive a lot of scientific and histori-
  cal facts from the book and also we seem to re-
  member these facts because their origin and use-
  fulness are pictured to us in logical form

    matured people are i find  different than
  little children connect certain facts by a story
  or apply them by a demonstration associate them
  to common objects and they remain with you
  forever

       of the average englishman i know i am tread-
       ing on holy ground but as one who has not yet
       had the opportunity to visit the land where abilities
       are more readily absorbed i have often wondered
       if it is true that john citizen is considered
       so green after all

       what i do like you all for over there is your
       aggressive attitude especially in the business sense
       we are slow to commence a new venture or to air
       a new thought

       although h g wells just suits your world of
       readers believe me he had a h- of a time getting
       popular here in fact he always was regarded
       as either a vain idealist or a crank but people
       generally are beginning to realize that what ap-
       peared cranky and crazy a few years ago are
       established habits and facts to-day

      we english will never admit it but never-
      theless we arc becoming more americanized every
      day our stores are mechanized and perfect in
      service and salesmanship business is beginning
      this last few years to develop into an exact
      scientific art

       and im sure we are glad of it in spite of all
       the grumbles which is our only privilege who
       would go back to the old order of travel or huckster
       type of shop the world is cleaner much more
       comfortable and happier im sure if not then
       its the peoples own thoughts in the wrong channel

      i have had every number of amazing stories
      including the annual winter and spring issues
      but i admit i only commenced reading six months
      ago still its sufficient to add that after reading
      the one number i ordered all the back numbers

       i now am always greedy for the next issue

       why dont you publish one in england in addi-
       tion or at any rate advertise it in our newspapers
       its marvelous the people i mention amazing
       stories to think im joking and never heard of it

      if any of your readers would like any photo-
      postcards of london or any historical part of the
      old country i will be delighted to send some in ex-
      change for interesting cards of new york and
      other parts of u s a

      by the way the channel tunnel from england
      to france will be fact soon they have already
      completed plans and are commencing shortly

      every success for amazing stories may it
      grow bigger-cannot be better surely

      you start your letter which we find very
      interesting by expressing wonder so in response
      to your wondering we will say that we highly
      approve of the average englishman and we know
      one average englishman or rather know of him
      and we would be pleased to hear that he had
      visited our country-and that is yourself the
      democratic party of old times had for its slogan
      the motto that the best governed country is the
      least governed but that unhappily is no longer
      the case laws and statutes cannot suppress the
      crime that is so rampant here where we are over-
      governed in the opinion of many

      england started the building of tunnels under
      water by the famous thames tunnel going back
      to the middle of the last century and now she
      has the mersey tunnel crossing the river from
      liverpool in this city we have a number of
      tunnels the pennsylvania tunnel starts under-
      ground in new jersey about a mile back from the
      hudson river and then goes under the hudson
      under the city of new york and under the east
      river coming out on long island it is a tunnel
      whose length few people realize certainly it
      would be very interesting to say the least to be
      able to go from england to france without getting
      seasick the tunnel in question is described and
        illustrated in science and invention-editor

   your tale about amazing stories in the home
 is quite graphic and we strongly suspect that
 there are other homes like ydurs the real solu-
 tion to the trouble might be to buy several copies
 but of course we couldnt ask for that if you
 knew how we give our best efforts to the selection
 of stories and how carefully they are edited from
 the standpoint of history literature and all branches
 of science you would find an explanation for the
 next to the last paragraph of your very interesting
 letter such an appreciation as yours operates to

a criticism of the sixth glacier

the fourth dimension and
psychical things

  editor amazing stoaies

   being a reader of amazing stories as long as
 im on this side i find it time to put my oar into
 the discussion

   first about the covers why do they have to
 be so lurid and screaming cant you tone them
 down a bit so one neednt be ashamed any more
 when acquaintances ask the eternal question

 how by all thats -- can an intelligent chap

 like you read such lurid stuff really i get
 tired trying to convince my friends that amazing
 stories is not just cheap fiction as appearances
 are too much against it the drawing as a rule
 is not so bad but the color is awful the stories
 as found in your magazine are on a high average
 in every magazine one finds a story once in a
 while thats punk besides tastes differ the
 worst ive found in amazing stories in a long
 while is that sixth glacier by marius that
 fellow took too many liberties with physical laws
 for instance a glacier is formed through pre-
 cipitation so it can only grow according to the
 rain or snowfall then it travels in relation to
 its growth which can never be more than a few
 yards a day so express train speed js impossible
 furthermore such an ice cap would have to
 come out of the oceans and ice caps such as he
 describes would just about have dried up all
 the oceans which disposes of his shipping
 projects then even if the people could have
 utilized all the remaining power resources to
 melt the ice it would have taken them centuries
 to make an impression

    about interplanetary travel do you know that
  there is an old saga which says that long ago
  when humanity was still young a space ship came
  to earth in a blinding flash and a terrible roar
  that it brought far advanced people who ruled and
  taught the young humanity that they brought
  wheat banauas and bees from their planet and
  that for several centuries there was quite a traffic
  between venus and earth that as soon as they
  had established a school and trained a staff of
  rulers and teachers the bulk of them went back
  to venus for good and that only four of them
  remained and became the real rulers of this
  earth

   another thing why do you always knock the
 so-called psychical anybody that ever has had
 a real psychic or superphysical experience and is
 honest can not deny that there is such a thing
 as a superphysical existence

   about the much discussed fourth dimension
 one aspect of it may be time some curious
 actions that their perpetrators claim to do through
 the employment of the fourth dimension are put-
 ting solids through solids or converting right-
 handed things into left-handed or vice versa or
 turning things inside out like a bowl so that
 what was inside later is outside

   it may be possible to do all such things by
 moving them back iu time until they are brought
 back to the stage in which they existed only as
 an idea turning them round there and bringing
 them back this might become possible iu such
 a short time that nobody could notice the actual
 happening some funny things do happen i
 for instance had a man vanish in plain daylight
 in a fraction of a second on a street in the middle
 of a big town under conditions that made any
 escape except through a two inch pipe impossible
 besides i had plenty of disinterested witnesses
 without something like a fourth dimension ex-
 planation of such happenings are impossible

                   frederick g hebr

           east th street new york city

    your letter is so descriptive that much of it
  requires  answer

    the editors find that stories criticized very un-
  favorably by some are greatly admired by others
  the best we can do is to strike a good average
  and we hope weve succeeded

    it is impossible to say what the glaciers did in
  the glacial age the few comparatively speaking
  now in existence travel very slowly but who can
  tell what they did a hundred thousand years ago
  what they might do in the future is unknown

   the legend about traffic between venus and
 earth of which you tell us is curiously like
 several of our interplanetary stories we wonder
 who the four ruliug venerians on this earth were

   science and invention one of our magazines
 gives a great deal of attention to psychic subjects
 and we would recommend you to its columns for
 the treatment of these matters we do not believe
 that your vanishing man went through a two-inch
 pipe even the fourth dimension could hardly
 explain it-editor

 for years there
 has been a cry-
 ing need for a really

and women everywhere have hailed it
with enthusiasm experienced stenog-
raphers as well as beginners are
adopting it

 right this minute you know the funda-
 mentals of this amazing new method-you
 use the same a-b-cs as you do in your
 daily speech no need to spend long tedi-
 ous months memorizing a foreign lan-
 guage of dots and dashes hooks and
 curves you start using speedwriting in a
 few hours and in a few weeks you can
 acquire all the speed and proficiency neces-
 sary for practical work

 learn speedwriting in

the planet jupiter-is it inhabited

  editor amazing stories

    i have bought copies of amazing stories regu-
  larly since the appearance of the first instalment
  of station x some three years ago that was
  the first time i read your magazine and i may
  say that the cover design and the title attracted
  my attention i am a veteran of the spanish
  american phillipine insurrection phase war
  peace time regular army service in the coast
  artillery and the world war with service over-
  seas living a very active life from the time i
  first entered the army and being one of the many
  humble actors in two momentous dramas and see-
  ing so many of our old time ideas and traditions
  shattered i found food for much thought along
  lines that never occurred to me before i found
  life rather dull at times after leaving the army
  and so i was searching the newsstands for some-
  thing interesting to read and saw the copy of
  amazing stories trash i thought but i bought
  the copy and well i think the opening lines of
  this letter contains more praise than i could write
  if i tried ever so hard

    i find the discussion columns interesting as
  well as the stories and while i have not the ability
  to write learnedly i am prompted to write to
  you after having read your editorial life the
  amazing puzzle in the february issue i am
  not questioning your sayings nor commenting on
  the editorial i am merely trying to sit at your
  feet and learn

    i find great interest in contemplating our sister
  planets in my minds eye and any stories about
  them captures my attention some of the inter-
  planetary stories i think good while others are
  not so good but that is beside the point i wish
  to write about

   among other things in the editorial you say
 jupiter by far the largest planet is still in a
 plastic form it has not cooled down we know
 for a certainty that life such as we encounter on
 this planet can not exist on jupiter are we
 sure that we know for a certainty that there is
 no life such as we know existing on jupiter
 science answers yea but i regret to have to accept
 that as a proven fact its too disappointing and
 too sad but do they know the greatest tele-
 scope leaves jupiter at a great distance from the
 unaided eye and then the atmospheres both of
 the earth and jupiter must be penetrated and the
 telescopes will magnify the moisture and dust in
 the two atmospheres the same as they magnify
 other objects thereby giving a blurred distorted
 image that may well be deceiving

    if there is a purpose in life as some try to teach
  us there is then there must be a creator to give
  that purpose if that is the case and the creator
  made this great vast solar system just in order
  to sustain life on this little sphere to say nothing
  about the vastness of our universe alone he
  must be rather a wasteful workman

life come into being wherever and whenever the
conditions for life obtains why could not those
conditions have obtained on jupiter and the other
outward planets ages ago is it their remoteness
from the sun and why not life on the sun
do we know for a certainty that the sun is
actually hot could it not really be a cold body
and is it not possible that all the heat we get
from the sun is produced by the friction of the
rays passing through our atmosphere and their
impact on the earth and if that could be true
would not the rays produce the same effect on
the distant planets then the mass of jupiter
being greater than the earth does it necessarily
follow that the gravity pull per square unit would
be correspondingly greater than on earth the
foregoing does hot represent my opinion on the
subjects mentioned but merely thoughts that some-
times course through my mind

                           henry s hatton
                           greentown ind

  there is a strong probability that the planet
jupiter is not habitable how such things can
be investigated or determined positively exceeds
the powers of humanity we do not see however
that you should be disappointed because we have
settled that there is no life on jupiter it some-
times seems as if there were too much life on
this earth jupiter seems to be in a state of
fusion and undoubtedly the sun is hot the heat
from the sun is not produced from friction of the
rays as they pass through the atmosphere nor by
their impact on the surface of the earth the
gravity force of jupiter is of course much greater
than that of the earth-editor

the non-explosive nature of trini-
trotoluene a good criticism
of the last man

editor amazing stories

  may i call your attention to an error in the
story entitled the last man in your february
issue in the story the man finds a can of
t n t in the museum with a warning label stat-
ing that a slight concussion will explode it and
proceeds to blow up the birth factory by dropping
it from the balcony

  now as a matter of fact a slight concussion
or a heavy one or either will not explode tnt
during the war high explosive shells containing
tnt were exploded by a percussion cap of
the fulminate of mercury which in turn ignited
the tnt i worked for a time in a shell loading
plant where tnt was melted in vats by steam
and then poured into hollow steel shells these
vats had metal covers upon which crystalline de-
posits of t n t formed in a yellow coating re-
sembling maple sugar but somewhat lighter in
color i have often seen workmen remove this
deposit by pounding the covers with wooden mal-
lets and never was there any danger of exploding
the tnt so it is apparent that no slight
concussion will ignite it

  otherwise the story was splendid and could
be made perfect by the mere substitution of an-
other explosive-fulminate for example i think
however that you should call attention to the
error for the benefit of your readers as a magazine
of your type should be accurate as to details of
this sort

  in conclusion may i thank you for many happy
hours spent in reading your interesting publication

plosive nature of t n t but you must remember
that many of these chemical explosives undergo
a slight decomposition and then become quite
dangerous it would be finely divided tnt
which would seem most liable to such decomposi-
tion the melted material would certainly be
more stable organic nitro compounds when
partly decomposed may become very sensitive to

  i	have just finished the may number of your
magazine i wish there were twice as many tales
in it

  the diabolical drug by clare w harris is
extremely interesting lets have more of hers
even though we do shudder

  the invisible finite certainly holds one
enthralled but please tell robert a wait to
end his stories more kindly in the future it left
me aching to read that the poor professor was lost
to humankind it seems horrible to think of him
seeking and searching forever and knowing that
he is helpless it would have been much better

is certainly a tribute to the quality of what we
are giving and it is a tribute to our success
what we do give makes you think but you must
not take the stories too seriously for there is little
to fear that anything like the gas-weed will ever

in the utterly stupid national hatreds leading to
