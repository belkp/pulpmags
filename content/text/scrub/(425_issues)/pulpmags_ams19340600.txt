    bradbury was a prince of good

    nobody wants you around in close
    quarters if you have halitosis un-
    pleasant breath its bad in busi-
    ness its worse in social life

      the insidious thing about it is
    that you yourself never realize
    when you have halitosis-and your
    best friend wont tell you more-
    over you are very likely to have it
    one authority says that  of
    cases are due to odors produced by
    fermentation of bits of food the
    tooth brush has failed to remove

       the quick way the pleasant way
     the safe way to get rid of halitosis
     is to rinse the mouth with listerine
     it readily cleanses the mouth and
     halts fermentation the principal
     cause of odors then it gets rid of
     the odors themselves your breath
     becomes pure and agreeable-can-

old time problems in mathematics

by t oconor sloane phd

there are probably some people
who would claim that it pleases
them better to go up-stairs than
to go down however this may be it
is certain that in the matter of numerical
roots and powers a child can go up
but in a sense it is virtually impossible
in some cases to do the descending move-
ment with final accuracy thus the
square of two is four its cube is eight
and so on if we want to extract the
cube root of eight it lies right before
us it is two but as a variation on this
and as a simpler thing to do on its face
attack the extraction of the square root
of eight it will he found to have a

decimal part of it reading 

but this is only the beginning of it
for the decimal will be mercilessly long
the number two ought to be very simple
but if you try to extract its square root

you will get another decimal without
end it starts off as     you
may multiply this by itself which multi-
plication will give its square but it will
not be exactly two because the decimal
is incomplete the same will apply to
your efforts to get the square root of
eight now if you will try to extract
the cube root of two you will again
have a patience-trying problem and an
endless decimal in the end

  there is in this last named extraction
of the cube root of two a historical
interest one of the unsolved problems
of old time mathematicians was to con-
struct two perfect cubes one of twice
the volume of the other this was one
of the great unsolved problems of the
ancient world its solution is absolutely
simple if -and that is a big if-if we
only knew any way of getting the cube
old time problems in mathematics



root of two in the case of two solids
of similar shape if one is to be twice
the volume of the other then the length
of similar corresponding parts must vary
with the cube roots of these lengths
thus if an edge of a cube has a length
of one the edge of a cube to be of eight
times the volume must have for its edge
a length expressed by the cube root of
eight which is two as we have seen
above this is simple enough a
cube one foot on an edge is only
one-eighth the volume of one with an
edgc-length of two feet but try to
calculate the length of the edge of
a cube two cubic feet in volume if
you are comparing the volume of two
spheres you can use the diameter for
your cubing or your cube-rooting as
the case may be thus if a planet is
of twice the diameter of another it will
be of eight times the volume of the
smaller one if you have two vessels
of corresponding shape one twice as
high and broad as the other if the
smaller one holds a pint the larger one
will hold a gallon the larger a tin
can is the less tin will be required to
hold a given amount a number of
small cans for the same contents would
require more tin if we go back to the
days of pythagoras or archimedes and
make our two cubes the one of twice
the volume of the smaller cube will
have an edge of a little over one and a
quarter times     that of the
smaller

  another problem is to find the diam-
eter of a sphere of the same volume
as our original unit cube the volume of
a sphere is expressed as  jtr we
have to find the value of r which is
the radius of the sphere to give a value
of one to the above expression this
operation is complicated by the fact that
we do not know the exact value of jt

  in old times twenty centuries or more
in the past we find some examples of

nudism of which one applies to the
determination of specific gravity the
great philosopher archimedes was con-
sulted by king hieron of syracuse as
to the proportion of gold and silver in
a crown which had been made for him
and he was suspicious of the jeweler
we are told that as the philosopher was
taking a bath he realized that he dis-
placed water equal to the volume of his
body as gold is much heavier than
silver for a given bulk this gave him
the clue to ascertain the proportions of
the two metals by determining the
specific gravity of the crown he is
said to have been so excited over his
discovery that he ran through the
streets as he came from the bath crying
eureka eureka the greek word for i
have found he did not know of an
action of alloys shrinking or expanding
as the case may be when their con-
stituent metals are melted together this
determination by specific gravity of the
percentage of metallic alloys of two
constituents-is taught in science schools
today as an approximate determination
of their composition it goes back to
a period over  years ago

  to the same philosopher is attributed
the burning of an attacking fleet by
concentrating the suns rays by a num-
ber of mirrors-bringing the suns rays
to a focus and setting the ships on fire
this impresses us as fiction or as merely
tradition

  in ordinary or everyday usage there
are three dimensions of space or of
objects occupying it in any sense the
point may be taken as the origin of
space of one dimension which is the
line next comes the plane which is
of two dimensions and the solid which
is of three dimensions the succeeding
fourth dimension is a mathematical ex-
pression in our practical world as
imaginary as the square root of a nega-
tive quantity v-a it is quite enter-


amazing stories

taining to work out some relations of the
different dimensions of space and this
includes the line though it seem diffi-
cult to treat a line as space for theoreti-
cally an infinite number of lines could
be put into the space occupied by a
single line in other words a line does
not occupy space in the true and exact
conception of things

  the relation of space of one or of
two dimensions to space of three dimen-
sions while it may be called quite ob-
vious does lead to somewhat impressive
results suppose we have a closed con-
tainer or can of thin metal such as tin
so called in everyday usage though it is
really iron coated with tin or some tin
alloy assume it to be a cube twelve
inches every way next suppose it is
desirable to put its contents into smaller
cans say one inch each way to make
the large can six square feet of tin
would be needed which is simple enough
yet somewhat impressive it would re-
quire  of the smaller cans to hold
the contents of the large can the tin
in each small can would be lth of
a square foot so that it would require
seventy-two square feet of tin to make
the little cans-twelve times as much
as for the large can yet they would
hold no more their combined capacity
would be the same-one cubic foot

  this is an example of the relations
of spaces of different orders and quite
amusing results can be reached by carry-
ing it out for different cases

  everyone has noticed the extensive
use of hurdles in country places sup-
pose a sheepfold is ten hurdles long
and one hurdle wide and it has to be
doubled in area by adding twenty
hurdles and making it twice as long or
by adding only two hurdles and making
it twice as wide its area will be doubled
the two hurdle way is certainly the
cheaper

  obvious as this is it is such problems

as the above that are used in text books
of calculus for practice in maximum
and minimum

 the pons asinorum bridge of
asses is a term which has had an
application in logic and in geometry and
our reference is to the last named
science it is the name given to the
fifth proposition in the first book of
euclid the famous geometer of twenty-
two centuries ago this proves that the
basic angles of an isosceles triangle are
equal each to the other the diagram
is symmetrical and pointed at the top
which is the apex of the triangle so
that it actually suggests a truss -for a
bridge the curious thing in connec-
tion with it is that the term is often
erroneously applied to the proposition
of the square of the hypothenuse of a
right angle triangle 

  this proposition tells us that the sum
of the squares of the sides of a right
angle triangle of the lines adjacent to
the right angle are equal to the square
of the hypothenuse-the other and
longer side the one opposite the right
angle the terms side and hypothenuse
are taken as giving lengths

  we will assume a right angle triangle
with sides  and  feet in length and
of course any other units may be used
other than feet then by the proposi-
tion cited the square of the hypothenuse
will be equal to the sum of the squares
of  and of  this sum  plus 
is  the almost famous square of the
hypothenuse its square root is  and
this is its length now the numerical
relation of the sides of a right angle
triangle may be anything but the law
of the square of the hypothenuse will
always hold the reader may try to
find for himself a relation of the sides
that will work out without any frac-
tion as   and  do in our right angle
triangle the one we are working with

  this   and  triangle has a very
old time problems in mathematics



practical use a note on which will get
us out of the perhaps dreary line of
theory suppose masons are laying out
the corner of a square building the
first thing to do is to measure off on
one side a length of some multiple of

	or of  suppose  is taken and six
times four feet which is  feet are
measured off on one side from the
corner then taking an  foot line
which is six times three feet one end
is attached to the comer where we
may suppose a heavy nail is driven this
line is stretched out and swung back
and forth until a position is found in
which its free end shall be exactly 
feet or six times five feet measured from
the distant end of the  foot line this
will give a perfect angle of  degrees
on which to start the foundation

  we know that for some reason people
want to live in square cornered houses

  the numbers   and  can be most
usefully applied in many such cases as
the above but let the reader try and
find three other integral numbers num-
bers without fractions the sum of the
squares of two of them equalling the
square of the third

  if we nail three pieces of wood to-
gether so as to form a triangle whose
lengths are in the ratio of   and 
it will give us a perfect right angle
square to use on our building

  in the problems of cubes the simplest
is the most difficult to solve it will
always involve a fraction in the cube
root of two which would give the side
of the cube of double the volume of
the original one it would be as end-
less a decimal as appears in the ratio of

the diameter to the circumference
of the circle any amount of puzzled
brains have worked on such problems as
these

  the history of the squaring of the
circle which is the determination of the
relation of diameter to circumference
starts with the value  for the factor
to give the circumference when it multi-
plies the diameter this is absurdly in-
accurate it is a little better to use the
factor  t which comes somewhere near
the mark but working on the calcula-
tion to get a decimal expression such
as     endless weary hours have
been spent the decimal has been car-
ried out to some three hundred figures
enough to fill a column of this maga-
zine it is designated by the greek
letter jt pi the number given above
involves an error of less than one thirty-
thousandth and two or three more fig-
ures make it accurate for nearly all
terrestrial requirements

  sometimes instead of the famous
multiple ji a proportion is used one
such ratio is named from a mathemati-
cian meteus it is expressed as 
to  the ratio of diameter to circum-
ference this is very close to the mark
applied to a circle one hundred feet in
diameter the error is less than the
twelfth of an inch

  if jc is carried out to eleven figures 
followed by a decimal of ten figures it
would bring out the circumference of
the earth with an error of less than the
twenty-fourth of an inch but we do
not know the diameter near enough to
obtain so near an approach to the cir-
cumference

our hero is now in the traditional land of atlantis an old old story of
ancient days opens for us in the second installment of this narration the
interest of the story rises after the introduction as we may call it of the first
chapters we are sure that it will hold our readers attention and prepare
them for the interesting finale which will appear in the third and last

 installment

what has gone before

el kasr was one of those ancient spots on the face of the earth which always held sir
john mansfield greatest living archseologist and egyptologist spellbound

   a native horda who had worked with sir john in the libyan desert excavations five
years previous meets him and begs money for whisky for his white derelict master in
exchange for a very old manuscript which he claims is genuine in his room mansfield
carefully studies the hieroglyphics and after submitting the manuscript to every known test
is certain the document is genuine it was written about - b c and by no other
person than the great egyptian king cheops himself after hours of study mansfield has
the following data beneath the giant statue of a reposing body of an animal with a human
head is the only entrance to atlantis with the further instructions in the manuscript indelibly
printed on his mind sir john starts out for the great sphinx after many disheartening attempts
to find an elusive spring given in the record and governing the opening of the secret panel he
disgustedly smashes the supposed spot and the panel slowly opens he dashes into the opening
just as the panel starts to close without realizing his sealed fate once inside however his
torch beam falls upon the inscribed walls and he forgets everything else the stones are
covered with the history of egypt op to the time of cheops the need of fresh air and of
water leads sir john down a dark passage which ends abruptly in a hole ten feet square
almost sending him into the pit following instructions inscribed on the wall he plunges his
knife blade into a slit in the wall and the void becomes completely closed up standing on the
platform sir john pulls the blade from the wall and immediately the stage drops at a terrific
speed throwing him to the floor and knocking him unconscious

    some time later sir john opens his eyes and yuxa high priest of the whites of atlantis
peaks to him in the ancient egyptian tongue and explains all that has happened to the people
of atlantis and also how they had followed sir johns movements from the time he entered
the sphinx yuxas daughter venia is also present after being fed and somewhat rested
sir john is taken to the council chambers where he tells the people of atlantis about the
civilization on the surface of the earth in the middle of the talk a voice is heard saying
the blacks have arisen the blacks are the slaves of the white people of atlantis the
battle that ensues is a very peculiar one being fought entirely with paralyzing rays as far as
the whites are concerned but the blacks use clubs and knives the science of surgery has
progressed in atlantis far in advance of anything known on the surface of the earth so wounds
are easily healed the blacks are finally subdued and the whites who have been fatally
wounded in sir johns opinion are treated with rays and are soon walking around again as if
nothing had happened to them and then things begin to happen

   what are you talking about man
he demanded harshly

   the blacks cried the young man
the outpost has just reported that a
group of blacks have crossed the man-
eating line with a girl it was venia
how she was captured they cant tell
the news was startling mansfield
felt a tremor pass through his body
venia taken by those bestial creatures

       chapter ix

          venia gone

down the aisle sped the tall
        figure of kodro his arms
        gesticulating wildly

          venia venia has been
          taken

yuxa stood stock-still at the announce-
ment his face masked
the lost city



mansfield released him and he flew over the brink and crushed head-first
into the oblique descent striking the edge of the circular pit


amazing stories

the thought was horrifying such a
young and refreshing body in the
clutches of a horde of brutes was enough
to make the man shudder he remem-
bered distinctly now that the girl hadnt
been in view at the finish of the battle
between the two bodies of men the
observation had clicked in his brain at
the time now it took on alarming pro-
portions sometime during the hectic
melee she had either gone from the
room and had been seized by the blacks
or else a black had stolen up into the
temple and had carried her off from
under their very eyes the former
seemed more probable though he
glanced at the high priest

  yuxa was uncontrollable seldom had
mansfield seen any man like this a
virulent display of emotion that seemed
to rise deep from within him drained
his ashy countenance

  drop everything ordered the high
priest with a snap she must be saved
from the wretches

his voice faltered but the men
were on their way already mans-
field hustled out with them surely it
seemed to him there was a purpose in
capturing the girl taking her life
in compensation for the number of their
own who were done away with didnt
sound plausible even though revenge was
highly dominant in the black mind it
was more likely he thought she would
be kept as a hostage she was the
daughter of the high priest and they
had made a specific effort to get only
her there would have been little
trouble compared to getting into the
temple and capturing venia to have
secured other white women but no they
had gone after the beautiful blonde-
haired girl

  the outpost stated kodro in an-
guish says that a large number of
blacks covered the girl as they carried

her across many of them were killed
but they succeeded in getting her
through our men couldnt break into
their defense

  naturally all work was disrupted
yuxa kept his thoughts now to himself
tt might have been that he was fearful
of trusting his voice out loud and
mansfield readily read him he pos-
sessed an intense devotion for his off-
spring his eyes tried to keep out that
hideous expression of horror - what
might happen to his daughter

  and mansfield found that those shud-
ders which were prickling his back and
needling the base of his brain held
him in an awful grasp he found him-
self issuing into prayer god let
nothing happen to the poor girl    

  already the news had spread through-
out the city and preparations were being
hastily made scores and scores of men
were pouring out into the open streets
and thoroughfares yuxa leaped amongt
them raising his hand

  my brothers this has reached the
climax the men of atlantis have tol-
erated the black race since the beginning
of time we have stood for their peri-
odical displays overlooking their brutal
natures even trying to make respectable
men out of them they are coarsely
ungrateful now    this is the
time they shall suffer from this mo-
ment on they shall all be rounded up
and subjected to the brain dissection
if they resist kill

  he hadnt spoken or mentioned ve-
nias name he didnt have to mans-
field saw how the capture of the girl
had upset all of them to them the
daughter of the high priest was as sacred
as her sire

  one man exclaimed an entire cham-
ber of cylinders has been looted a
group of blacks overpowered the guards
during the main fight and made off with
them it will be no easy matter they
the lost city



will fight beyond the man-eating
line-

  yuxas eyes were electric sparks we
shall cross every white man will lay
down his life to wipe out the black
evil

  it was now that mansfield received
his initiation into their efficiency into
units they divided nothing like the un-
tidy mass of men who had met the on-
coming blacks each unit had as its
head either a priest or man of science
the latter distinguished by a sparkling
metallic tiara around the head it was
decided that the men were to proceed to
the man-eating wall there the rays
which were centered upon the malignant
grayish matter were to be shut off in
one place a unit armed with hand cyl-
inders would drive the seething stuff into
the main stretch and the overhead rays
would be thrown back on again in
that manner it would be able to make a
wide channel in the grayish matter
through which the men could pour

  mansfield was next to yuxa at the
head of the main body of men as the
wall of demarcation was reached up
ahead there could be seen already at
work the unit with the rays in both di-
rections as far as the eye could reach
extended the colorful emanation which
guarded the man-eating matter it was
a beautiful creamy blue

  the unit cleared a large hole directly
through the center and the men rushed
through into an open plain far ahead
was the lighted outline of the habitat
which harbored the blacks but no
force of men was at hand to meet
them

  the englishman thought it strange
this progress without onslaught if the
blacks had taken pains to secure the
daughter of the high priest they sure-
ly would have maintained a strong stand
in keeping her with them but no
rush of blacks was evident which would

show a dark body of men onward
poured the whites

t   v	q	 v 

they were soon on the outskirts of
the village and yuxa with fore-
sight distributed his men accordingly
they were to surround the entire
place and give no quarter venia must
be secured even if every man had to
stake his life and not a black must be
permitted to escape all must be taken

  but if there was a battle it was de-
cidedly one-sided for the white men
of atlantis circled the entire black place
swooped down upon the buildings pour-
ing through the arched portals and not
one black man was evident there was
nobody there

  they poked through every interior for
hours without finding a trace of them
and their amazement knew no bounds
yuxa was in a frenzy it was now be-
ginning to dawn upon the white men
that the black race had been even more
insidious than they had appeared but
there was no other place they could have
gone the large number of them could
absolutely not have gone anywhere with-
out the whites being aware of it yet the
paradoxical fact remained squarely to
oppose them

they were scattered all over the
place forcing prying eyes into any-
thing that looked suspicious sir john
mansfield found himself a lone hand in
this affair prodding his nose in and out
of the dwellings they were rather fine
stone buildings worthy of a better mind
and more stable temperament he
thought the walls were tapestried with
fine cloth drawings and designs the
furniture was finely wrought of metal
the doors however were simple in con-
struction not similar to the walls in the
temple it was comparatively easy to go
from room to room

it was strange the colony couldnt


amazing

stories

have transported itself into thin air
the blacks must be around here some-
where mansfield wondered could they
have forseen this invasion and have
countermoved into the city of atlantis
at the same time the whites were go-
ing through the man-eating wall it
hardly seemed probable there were
too many men about the temple some
wrord would have come to them had thai
happened

  he found himself in a cellar wrhich
was littered with refuse carefully he
moved around inspecting the odds and
ends which were heaped there in
one corner the wall was almost obscured
from sight by a pile of trash detach-
ing piece by piece he placed them in
the middle of the room maybe there
was some reason for all this maze but
when he had finally got a look at the
filthy wall the slimy stone told him he
had failed

  tt was arduous work this tugging and
toting of the broken and misshapen
articles his clothes were bedaubed with
dirt and torn and somewhat weary he
moved one of the broken chairs closer
braced it against the wall and sat down
his cylinder which he had used more
as an illuminating projector than a
weapon was flashed around the base-
ment

  it was a wide and deep cellar the
upper floor rested squarely upon a stone
foundation without any support in the
center well-built and suddenly he
leaped from his chair with a cry as his
light played upon a tatter of a garment
against the wall nearby in one
bound he reached it and snatched it up

it was a clean piece of cloth which
had no place in this grimy interior
hed swear he had seen the design
somewhere recently certainly he had
he remembered it distinctly now com-
ing out of his unconscious state in the

upper chambers of the temple just after
entering atlantis his eyes had fallen
upon the garment which clothed a body
seated near him this tatter was a piece
torn from the robe of venia

  this knowledge galvanized him venia
had passed this way she had struggled
and had parted with this down into
the bedraggled place she had been
brought

  mansfield stood firmly on his feet
poised for something he knew not what
it seemed to him that this remnant fore-
cast imminent danger it had some re-
lation to the problem of the disappear-
ing blacks that he was sure and it
meant that somewhere near was the girl
venia was nearby he must not fail
her he must be cautious

  he first must find out whether these
walls were false or not whether the lit-
tered cellar was only a blind to conceal
some hidden means of exit quickly
he went around the walls and knocked
on the blocks of stone for a hollow
sound his thoughts were in a furor
had the daughter of the high priest
been done away with this piece of the
robe spoke for itself there had been
a struggle and a struggle a resistance
brought to mansfields shuddering mind
any possibility those creatures might
have taken their vengeance out on her
and have killed her

  for a moment he debated the idea of
hastening up and bringing to light this
discovery the whites could wreck this
cellar in a short time and find out
whether there was a hidden spot about
but time would be lost that wouldnt
do while he was hurrying upward
anything might happen to the girl and
mansfield kept telling himself that venia
was yet alive that she couldnt have
been slain

  he tapped with fierce energy but a
solid echo kept ringing in his ears it
ridiculed his haste but he couldnt
the lost city



give up-he couldnt he was ready to
lay his life down that this theory of a
rag- was right that everything lay right
here his eager knife swept swiftly
through cracks and cracks maybe a
slab would come loose working fran-
tically of a sudden he felt his spine
shiver with an iciness that almost coag-
ulated his blood brought cessation to
his respiration a voice was behind
him

 ha what fortune brings us the
stranger to atlantis

  he whirled throwing his light around
but he didnt need it a huge negro
bare of clothing but for a filthy girdle
of cloth stood leering at him through
crooked yellow teeth his beastly
scowl accentuated his abnormal nose and
mouth his body glistened with a sheen
from the small light he was holding fo-
cussed upon the englishman

  and then mansfield saw the opening
in the wall behind the fellow it
yawned blackly in a steep descent and
it was right near the spot where he had
picked up the tom cloth what a fool
he had been not to search there first

 with a cry that rumbled from his
larynx mansfield leaped running
through his mind was his own con-
demnation for not getting assistance
when he had had time for now com-
ing out of the hole was another and
another huge black they carried clubs
that would have frightened away a be-
hemoth the odds were tremendously
against him

  mansfield struck the foremost black
squarely and together they crashed to
the floor in a moment legs and arms
were thrashing the air as the other two
blacks were cast into the fight the
scientists blood was gushing through
him at a high pressure racing with a
madness that forced three blows where
ordinarily he would have struck one

he laced out with his boot once and
succeeded in dislodging a face which had
its slashing fangs in his calf these
men fought like carnivorous beasts his
fists crunched venomously again and
again upon abhorrent visages that
grunted and he saw blood and blood
he was covered with the red stuff

  a ferocious blow caught him fairly
in the mouth and he went berserk he
sprang on the fellow nearest him and
wrapped his long arms about his neck
and choked him another blow struck
him glancingly on the side of the head
and numbed his hold throwing him
back against the wall

  it was a moments respite and he
gasped for breath surveying through
misty eyes the situation one black was
on the ground moaning that must
have been the fellow he had kicked
heavily in the face but the other two
battered and bruised were slowly creep-
ing upon him eyeing him through slitty
orbs mansfield took a deep breath
there was no way out of this now hed
have to yell with all his might to get
the whites to know he was in trouble

  but he never opened his mouth the
two blacks made swift disconcerting
moves and one of them let fly the club
it caught mansfield right under the ear
he was felled like a poled ox-a total
blackness suffusing his consciousness

chapter x

the circular pit

for all of sir john mansfields
years of experience in the delv-
ing in archaeological information
concerning races and peoples who had
existed down through the ages the vast
profundity of knowledge attained didnt
equal one whit the experience he was
now gathering in the very midst of a
historical supposedly legendary people


amazing stories

  so he couldnt help but thinking now
lolling on the ground trying to assuage
that terrific ache which sprang from his
almost split head where he was he
didnt know but a good two hours be-
fore he had roused himself from his
stupor and had found that he was in
this intensely dark place he made no
effort to rise but lay back and fell into
intermittent meditation for all the throb-
bing pounding head

  things certainly had happened since
his arrival he told himself there was
no denying the fact that he had seen
plenty in his short presence in atlantis
enough that wojld enable him to bring
to a kaleidoscopic clearness the intimate
mannerisms which existed here he had
informative values at hand which would
cause a revision of ancient historial civ-
ilization and think of those brilliant
things the brain dissection process the
multifarious number of rays and that
man-eating animal matter a substance
like that in the possession of a great
power would practically mean absolute
dominance let loose a quantity of the
parasitic organism in any one country
and that nation with its people was
doomed

  yes this rotating earth certainly did
contain miracles mysteries which the
human eye was too blind to size up just
imagine one of the wonders of the
world the great sphinx standing as it
had for untold centuries over a desert
plain unknown as to purpose unex-
ploited as to intention why billions
of eyes had gazed speculatively upon
the massive edifice down through time
and had simply conjectured it as a whim
of a long-dead ruler of a mighty egyp-
tian people little had they thought
that it stood ready to be utilized ready
to display its hidden wares and only for
the taking but no one had seen

  a great god that was designed for
silence it didnt speak-couldnt speak

but how well it replied in silent lan-
guage once its meaning wras established
during the forty to fifty centuries but
two men had fallen heir to the means of
entrance-had found that such a thing
did exist-he and that long-rotted car-
cass which lay doubled up and shape-
less at the foot of the massive slab in
the stone passage and now-

g radually he came out of this
f revery he became more and
more rational presently his musings
were gone and he found that his split-
ting head was resounding to the predic-
ament he was in the blacks vith their
uncanny hatred had created this safety
rendezvous of which the whites knew
nothing they must have foreseen such
a time as this

  tt grew upon the scientists mind that
their occasional attacks had not been
as the high priest had believed aimless
essays they had probably tried time
and again to get the daughter of yuxa
now they felt that they held the upper
hand something with which to form-
ulate a plea for themselves there wasnt
a white man who wouldnt give his life
to save the girl

  he rose groggily and steadied himself
against the wall still he could see
nothing it was a stygian blackness
which enveloped him he stumbled
hugging the wall closely fumbling along
it he wondered what sort of room he
was in perhaps there was some means
of escape from it

  his hand dragging back and forth
fell across his hip and he let out a burst
of surprised relief his gun was still
in its holster together with the car-
tridges what luck the black cap-
tors had not taken them from him they
had not apparently understood their
importance known their real value
those animal-featured creatures would
of course not understand anything oth-
the lost city



er than a ray cylinder a club or a
knife they had paid no attention to
his gun  what fortune

   it was an elation that in itself almost
healed the palpitating head the pres-
ence of his revolver meant to him more
than anything else right now he could
stand off a whole regiment of blacks
given a point of vantage his blood
tore through his veins and arteries with
shrieking hope with fired purpose if
only he could find some way of getting
out of here the better were his chances
for rescuing the girl he must get out

  venia must be gotten from their
clutches he felt sure now that she
still lived hadnt they taken pains not
to do away with him their only hope
in saving their own skins was to play a
tactful hand and that they seemed to be
doing

  he must have progressed with his
back to the wall for about fifty feet
when the darkness suddenly gave way to
an illumination which threw the entire
place into relief he found himself in
a large chamber with a low ceiling but
what brought his lips to a pursing whis-
tle was the sight that met his eye his
feet rested upon a narrow ledge about
three feet wide which ran away from the
wall then dropped slopingly to the very
center of the room where there loomed
up a circular hole about ten feet in
diameter

how fortunate he was had he
started to prowl about before he
would have undoubtedly stepped off the
rim of the ledge and skidded downward
to that round pit which took on a more
terrifying aspect the longer he looked
at it it was a sure means of self-de-
struction

  his head was in a daze his theory
was all shattered they didnt care
whether he lived or not had he slipped
here he would now probably have been

a dead man good lord he hoped
venia hadnt been thrown into this
place

  his eyes met the blank stare of bare
walls there seemed to be no opening
from this chamber he stared long at
that circular pit below him pondering
the idea of letting himself down from
the ledge and finding out where the hole
led the more he gazed around at the
unending walls the more attractive
loomed the possibility that the hole
might take him somewhere if he were
careful and cautious he could be sure of
his footing

  he dropped over the flat rinj and
wriggled down slowly his hands and
feet moved with infinite precision there
was a moment when he thought that his
body was going- to fly from under him
but his wet and perspiring hands clamped
down on the cold stone and nipped the
momentum

  at the edge of the circular pit he
dug his hobnailed boots into the stone
setting himself and looked down an
awful cry went from him as his eyes
gazed at the unbelievable thing down
there that hole was a receptable for
the grayish man-eating matter once
one had seen that bubbling animal sub-
stance the eye would never forget it
and the bluish iridescent ray hovered
over it keeping it in check

  great heavens he must get away
quickly back upon the ledge every
moment he tottered on this edge might
mean doom for him what a fool he
had been to take this horrible chance
had he known what lay there nothing
under the sun could have made him
slide down to it so lambently

  his fingers grasped the stone till they
bled and he started to crawl back up
this was nothing like the untroubled
descent but a moment before the very
thought of his narrow escape from a
hideous death made his upward pro-


amazing stories

gress all the more severe it was a deep
relief when his tensed fingers touched
the top of the ledge and he drew himself
upon it his body was shaking

feebly he dropped in a crevice
next to the wall and exhaled hor-
rible thoughts the picture of those
blacks being fed to the matter rose up
before him in virulent waves it wasnt
a cherished end any way one would
look at it that unearthly stuff took
you and kept your passing a secrt in
its fiendish heart

  he shrunk against the wall thank-
ful for its protection his hand fell over
the butt of his gun and caressed it
just give him one good break let him
get possession of venia and by thun-
der he would fill every attacking black
with bullets his mouth fastened into
a grim line all he wanted was just one
crack at those fiends that he had been
thrown into such an awful place was
making him decidedly angry the sight
of the man-eating stuff had turned his
fairness and tolerance to one side his
fingers itched to get around the throat
of a black

  he was lying thus crouched when
from the corner of his eye he saw a sec-
tion of the wall just overhead slide up-
ward and a leering countenance show
itself the black fellow was looking in
to see whether the prisoner had fallen
into the pit a huge mouth opened into
the semblance of a grin as he stared at
the grisly pit

  spontaneously mansfield saw that
fate had opened its hand to his unuttered
plea here was his opportunity the
black didnt see him because he lay
directly beneath him but if the fel-
low decided to glance below it would
be a simple matter to glimpse him the
gloating face however seemed content
to think that he had slid into the gray-
ish death

  with a leap mansfield was out of his
crouched position and he timed his out-
stretched hands beautifully the wiry
fingers enveloped the black throat be-
fore the other knew what happened a
terrific jerk and the scientist had pulled
him through the opening

  it was a delightful feeling this yield-
ing neck in his hands there was a
terrified look on the black face it tried
to bite itself loose from the steely mus-
cles which was clamping out life his
vocal muscles were paralyzed he
couldnt cry out the voice never was
heard again mansfield released him
and he flew over the brink and crashed
head-first into oblique descent striking
the edge of the circular pit bounding di-
rectly across it to smash into the op-
posite side then dropped from view into
that hungry mass below

  the englishman tottered on the ledge
from the exertion it had carried him
away from the wall near the edge with
a supreme effort he threw himself up-
ward and clutched the opened panel
it saved him instantly he clung to
it breathing spasmodically then with
feline agility he leaped through it and
was in the other room

  it was an elaborate interior with
many seats and lounges and fortunately
it was empty he had to work fast
though in one motion he closed up the
panel and surveyed minutely the room

there came to his hearing the
sound of voices and like a flash he
dropped behind one of the large be-
decked chairs from a narrow slit be-
tween the rungs he saw a cloth being
pushed aside and two blacks entered

  they glanced about questioningly
one them said

  where is mantsi he was supposed
to be here

  the other strolled over to the panel
and flung it open look the prisoner

has fallen into the pit he is not there
good he is one less white to con-
tend with

  mantsi must have gone up to re-
port it to okrulla ha ha

  both fell into a laughing cackle which
brought utter disgust to the concealed
man they were no more than beasts in
emotional expression mansfield could
see them sit down upon a lounge their
widespread nostrils contract d with each
steamy breath their greenish orbs were
slits that moved around unceasingly with
horrifying effect

  but the englishman was tensed his
hand was on his gun eyeing every
move not now did he intend that he
should be taken a prisoner again without
retaliation his fears were unfounded
however one of them rose to his feet
and leered

  we hold the upper hand now ok-
rulla will make those white devils come
to us he has the girl both burst
into a loathesome sputter they think
theyll get her when okrulla demands
complete freedom for us ha ha we
shall mow them down when they least
know it the girl will be okrultas
and well all have the choice pick of the
rest

  mansfield fought hard to keep his
laboring breath from giving him away
how he longed to throw himself into
the open and send slugs into their rot-
ten bodies but he couldnt do that
he must use discretion freedom was a
thing to him now when he had boundless
duties resting upon his head what he
had heard from these two evil lips fore-
bode a terrible disaster he felt that
the white would assume the old regime
once more if they would be able to get
the daughter of the high priest back
again

  and he mansfield was the only white
man who knew of all it behooved him
to move with sanity with caution

  the standing black moved toward the
door you stay here katka i shall
go over and see what the girl is do-
ing when mantsi returns you can
leave

  and with another of those demonaical
laughs he quit the room the remaining
black rose from the lounge and moved
around presently he strode to the panel
and glared through it another cackle
dropped from him he seated himself
upon the chair behind which crouched
mansfield

  it was now or never the scientist
gathered his energy for one swift blow
silently he removed his gunand held it
by the barrel he sprang up and
swung with all his might at the black
head which was turning startlingly the
force almost tore the weapon from his
hands the fellow stiffened sank for-
ward

  with a frenzied speed he raised the
heavy body and dragged it to the open
panel a heave and he saw the figure
bound out upon the slope skid crazily
downward and out over the pit drop-
ping from sight another one dealt
with

  he rushed toward the opening of the
draped cloth and peered out an in-
ward rush of gladness rose within him
proceeding along the long corridor was
the black who had said he was going
to where venia was mansfield could
follow him straight there

chapter xi

the torture chamber

ouickly cautiously he padded
after the fellow the black
was swinging along in care-free
fashion utterly scornful of everything
but of his own importance and mans-
field gave no cause for him to feel that
someone was following he hugged the


amazing stories

walls like a dark shadow flitting in long
noiseless strides when he had the oppor-
tunity gliding along step by step when
the other slowed

  the corridor was a very long one
sinuous and narrow at one time the
black came abreast of a portal and gazed
into it looking absently backward but
the englishman was a silent posing fig-
ure which blended perfectly with the
surroundings

  sir john mansfield was glad of one
thing he knew where the pit chamber
was situated it struck him that he
alone could withstand any number of
assailants there with his gun it was
an excellent stand he could pick them
off one by one as they came through
could pitch them into the gray matter

  the black stopped before a door and
glided in mansfield followed carefully
pressed against the wall now was the
time to proceed with caution in all
probability that was where venia was
he couldnt jumble the whole thing at
this momentous instant he must not
let his chance slide through his fingers

  his hand came in contact with a sharp
turn in the wall and he squirmed silent-
ly around it a dark cloth shrouded
what he presumed to be the door with
imperceptible precision he drew it aside
a thin beam of light greeted him

  the room was empty and was in ap-
pearance similar to the one he had left
in a moment he had slipped through
standing statuesque keen eyes flitting
around he heard loud voices and
dropped like a plummet behind a divan

  the cloth at the other end of the
room swished back and the black he had
been following emerged in the company
of another they moved toward the
center talking

  give her another hour in there
make her suffer

  as you say he nodded

  good then she will be taken to ok-

rulla again he heard that name

  they laughed gleefully with a fare-
well gesture one went to the entrance
and departed the other chuckled to
himself flexed his arms and went into
the next room

mansfield waited for a few

moments it was clear to him
that venia was in the next room now
was the time to collect himself he
rose from behind his concealment with
a trembling heart the girl was under-
going torture that much he gleaned
from their conversation and the
thought of the girl undergoing forced
hardship fired his brain

  he sprang from his cover and
snatched the weapon from its holster in
a twinkling he had torn aside the cov-
ering of the portal

  it was a two-by-four construction
completely paneled in a transparent mat-
ter which gave insight into a large room
beyond mansfield halted watching the
black who was applying his strength on
a lever of some sort the fellow pulled
the thing back at the move there issued
from a large pipe in the ceiling a hissing
sound like escaping compressed air

  and then he saw venia she had
been thrown into the air from her
crouched position on the floor and the
same unseen force grasped her and
hurled her against the wall her eyes
were staring widely hair disheveled but
her lips were pressed tightly together
she was resisting this torture without a
moan

  it was some sort of vacuum chamber
there were round holes in the wall at
regular intervals and as the black threw
back the lever something forced all the
air out of the room the rushing force
picked up everything within and slammed
them viciously against the walls

  the sight of the daughter of the high
priest being knocked about so viciously
the lost city



brought a fierce expression to mans-
fields eyes he yelled once indiscreetly
causing the black to whirl around the
dusky fellow sprang upon him with a
curse but fell backward as a bullet
crashed into him

  the englishmans first act was to re-
lease the lever and let the girl slump
from her forced posture against the
wall he knew now that the shot might
have been heard it would have rever-
berated clear down the corridor he
must work with celerity

  like a trapped animal in a burning
cage he sped around and around trying
to find some means of opening the glass
panel but he could find nothing he
knocked violently against the glass
pressed his face in it waving frantically

  his movements were seen immedi-
ately the girl rose to her feet and
stared amazedly at him she fumbled
toward him but her last bit of strength
had gone and with a movement of the
mouth she sank once more upon the
ground

  there came to mansfields ears the
sound of slapping feet and he hurried
to lug the body of the black back into
the first room where he tossed him
under a lounge anything that would
delay the blacks from finding out what
had happened his mind was on one
thing now he couldnt save venia at
the moment he must take care of him-
self

  one good thing though venia had
seen him that meant a lot she would
know that he was around to protect
her it would give her a rejuvenation
of spirit to keep on fighting knowing
that someone was at hand to come to
her aid

he dived behind a chair just as two
blacks came bounding into the
room staring wildly for the explana-
tion of that sudden noise mansfield

saw both distinctly he laughed to him-
self as he saw the two come out of the
torture chamber with astonished faces
they looked at each other for a mo-
ment then returned to stare once more
into the transparent wall

  mansfield glided out like a ghostly
being breathing a sigh of relief when
once again in the corridor but a glance
told him that he must not tarry from
the other end of the passage were run-
ning more blacks he might be able to
make his way to the pit room if he were
careful

  in the shadows he moved he thanked
the guiding hand which watched over
him that at that moment no black men
were coming toward him from the near-
er end of the corridor that would
mean instant discovery it was a break
for him that the chamber of the man-
eating matter was at the end of the
long hallway

  in a flash he had sped across the cor-
ridor and into the chamber but his
slithering feet spoke volumes to the
black who was napping in a chair the
fellow sprang to his feet rubbing his
bleary eyes surprise was all over him

  ghost of the gods where did-

  sir john mansfields gun roared once
and the other pitched over on his face
almost before he had hit the ground
the scientist had hoisted him upon his
shoulder and he hauled him to the
panel and disposed of him

  he couldnt have helped firing even
though he knew the shot would be in-
vestigated immediately the negro
would have come out of his stupor at
any moment and this wasnt a time he
could afford to fight with a black he
would probably have struggled with him
ineffectually until the others came then
it would have been all over they
would have thrown him into the cir-
cular chasm without another word he
was only a pestiferous thorn in the black


amazing stories

 domain he was not wanted then

  tteet pounded and again he con-
  cealed himself a half dozen men
  came in with a rush halting with utter
  consternation on their distorted faces
  they looked through the open panel
  turned in dismay

    what is this strange noise which
  sounds through the walls one of them
  said and where is the guard

   we found nothing where the girl
  is the guard is gone too i tell you
  it is a sign of wrath from the gods
  they look evilly upon our attitude to
  the whites

    stop enough of your snivelling
  brexshu speak not of the diety in
  such tongue there was a snarl in his
  voice

   i fear-

    mansfield while watching with abated
  breath saw the infuriated face of the
  man presumably the leader go stark
  mad saw him raise his ham-like fist
  and crush the other into insensibility
  with one blow the fellows knees
  buckled from under him and he stretched
  out the other blacks stood around and
   gaped

    no more do i hear such blasphemy
  understand  the gods are with us
  throw this rodent through the hole
  two blacks lifted the unconscious man
  as though he were a mere feather and
  flung himself out then the leader said
  two of you stay here if that sharp
  noise occurs find out what causes it
  we are safe here the girl is the only
  white in the hidden depths and if
  those guards show their faces pounce
  upon them and dispatch them as was
  done to brexshu

   they nodded mansfield couldnt
  help but smile those guards were gone
  forever now  and these simple fellows
  not once had they instituted a search of
  the chambers they were charged with

the dogmatic belief that their creation
of a hidden place was unapproachable
that nobody could get to them per-
haps that might be true but he mans-
field was loose it didnt enter their
minds to search for anybody the only
thing they understood was what they
saw they had seen him thrown into
the pit no one had ever gone out
alive from it thus he was a dead
man

  but mansfields heart beat very much
in life as he slouched in back of the
obstruction and his grin was a thing
which felt good to his tired and bruised
body that welt on the head still ached

  he let up his vigil not one iota hold-
ing the gun firmly in his hand the two
blacks were pacing the room nervously
sitting down getting up if only these
creatures had a little mental capacity
they might be an exceedingly dangerous
foe he shifted his position a trifle
the cramp in his leg sent a prickling
sensation through it

  the next moment his exuberance
burst into a groan of dismay as his foot
caught in the leg of the chair and it
skidded forward revealing his crouching
posture clearly

chapter xii

masks of the gods

nerves of the blacks were on
and the sudden scraping of
hair brought them to their
feet their eyes fell upon the doubled-
up figure of the man they had thought
long dead and they screamed hoarsely
then their greenish eyes became infused
with a fearful vengeance and they
sprang with arms outstretched mania-
cally bent upon destruction

  the first impact of the three bodies
knocked the gun from mansfields hand
and he went down beneath the crushing

the 
the lost city



weight two arms like whipcords went
around him and began to squeeze the
air from his lungs

  he was stunned his breath had left
him in the fall but it was this that
saved him from those strong elastic arms
which were trying to strangle him his
body became limp even though his mind
was clearing the black loosed his hold
a trifle to get even a better one mans-
fields knee came up with a sudden vi-
cious jerk the black face betook a
pastiness that made his ebon a sickly
yellow and he slumped backward and
rolled over

  gasping snorting mansfield rolled
out of the way of the black who dived
for him but the black fingers succeed-
ed in getting a hold of his khaki shirt
and they dug their nails into it clear to
the skin in another moment the two
were rolling over the floor legs draping
over each other in a wild scrap fin-
gers clawed red streaks into each oth-
ers faces in an endeavor to get a lasting
grip

  the black presently got his thumb in
mansfields eye and gouged it was so
harsh a pain that the scientist thought
he was going mad he sunk his teeth
into that iron fist until the blood dribbled
around his lips his right hand cupped
the disgusting face and shoved back-
ward

  never had he fought like this it
was life or death the taste of that
horribly salty blood upon his lips was
abominably sickening in his confused
subconscious mind he was a carnivor-
ous beast feasting on the life fluid of
another beast a power-suffusing gall
crept over him

  the thumb was a piece of lacerated
flesh and bone and it dropped use-
less from the eye of mansfield it had
been chewed down to numbness slowly
the crush of his ribs began to tell on
him in another moment they would

give way to a snap and then their
writhing bodies crashed into a table-
and it toppled over on them

  they were free once more mans-
field sprang to his feet his frantic eyes
sweeping the room for the gun it was
lying right at his feet he couldnt
deceive himself now he had very little
strength left his eye hurt him awfully
and the black before him rose with a
vigor that manifested his reserve power
he dived for the gun and gripped it
with an inspiring clutch lord didnt
it feel good within his palm

just in time did he whirl both
blacks were now upon their feet
their faces were hardly human any
more the pupils of their eyes were
pin-points of repulsiveness

  one of them had drawn a long slen-
der blade from his dirty loin cloth and
was advancing ominously the other was
still groggy from the knee-jam and
groaning feebly but he circled to get in
an effective blow

  mansfield felt a sag in his muscles
his bruised eye was burning him dread-
fully it couldnt last much longer both
blacks leaped through the air

  his finger pulled back the trigger the
room reverberated to the crash the
black with the knife stopped in mid-air
the blade slipping from his fingers and
clanking to the floor the noise of the
gun halted the other abruptly he gaped
with open mouth at the deed committed
right before his eyes glanced unbe-
lievedly at his fellow black who lay
gasping his last with a fiendish yell
he sprang for the knife grasped it his
arm drew back and flung the sharp point
straight at the englishmans breast with
a speed that made the shining metal
quiver as it hurtled through space

  in the same split second mansfield
flung himself to one side and fired again
the black was knocked backward by the


amazing stories

thudding bullet and the knife whizzed
by mansfield only slashing his shirt he
stood on the balls of his feet and rocked
regaining his breath without another
glance at the fallen pair he whirled for
the door and was out in the corridor

  there wasnt time to dispose of the
bodies he must get out of the place
where he didnt know twice the blacks
had been puzzled by the loud report
twice they had blundered in the attempt
to solve the mystery but now the
sight of the two prone bleeding bodies
would be associated with an existing
fact and they would scour the place
for some reason until they found him
no-he wasnt safe at all he must be
doing something

  across the corridor he saw a draped
doorway into which he plunged be-
hind him sounded the rush of numerous
feet a glance ahead revealed the bot-
tom steps of a flight of long winding
stairs and he fled upward his breath
was laboring painfully

he bounded up and up when he
reached a turn he halted for a
short spell to get his breath in the
angle of the corner a cloth covered a
small alcove he spread it open to look
at it-just as many voices and feet were
to be heard coming up the stairs

  quickly he threw himself into the
narrow confinement it held one per-
son very uncomfortably but it wasnt
bodily convenience that he was looking
for at the moment any pause would
help and this afforded it with swift
deft fingers he rolled back the cloth cov-
er and held it without a ripple and to
his ears there came loudly now the ap-
proaching mob the puffing breath of
many bodies the harsh strident tones
the scrape of many sandals past him
they bounded

  there is something amiss here a
yoice gasped as it went by the

noise and now here are two dead ones

  i tell you the whites have something
to do with this one of them must
have gotten through shujee saw some-
one flit out down there and make this
way 

  so someone had seen him had he
well that simply meant that they would
be looking and searching for him until
they found him his trump card of be-
ing an unexpected enemy down here
had vanished he had to be wary now
mansfields stiffened figure moved not
one flick his rigid fingers trembled not
as they kept the cover from uncovering
his presence

  the last pair of feet had clumped by
he listened for more but there were
none it wouldnt last long he knew
this brief escape would soon be bring-
ing them all back down this way just
as soon as they had scoured the upper
corridors and rooms they would search
every possible avenue it was rash to
remain here

  his hand reached behind him and
palmed the wall while his brow puckered
up in thought how well did he realize
the oppressive odds which were against
him he didnt know his way around
here anything he might do would proba-
bly be just the wrong effort the only
thing he was sure of was that a fierce
mob of men would swoop down upon
him and tear him to shreds

  he pressed his hand against the wall
with a determined eye he was going
to see it through hed give until his
last bit of strength gave out

  and then he felt himself flying back-
ward 

  something must have loosened behind
him from the pressure of his hand his
surprised face looked behind him just
in time to see a large slab of rock pivot
quickly to one side with nothing to
support him at his back he fell like a
load of metal down that yawning open-
the lost city



ing it was a fall of only a half a dozen
or so feet but it stunned him completely
for a minute

  his twisting head had crashed into
some solid substance with a resounding
smack his body following in a quick
accompaniment

his brain cleared he moved first
one leg then the other testing for
broken bones his arm which had
crumpled beneath his body moved out
and shook itself it truly was miracu-
lous that he hadnt broken something in
that short heavy fall

  he sat up and rubbed his head that
organ certainly had of late been the
recipient of plenty but the faithful
old dependable still worked his eyes
were becoming accustomed to the dim
light of the room he glanced upward

  there was a short flight of steps lead-
ing down from the slab of stone through
which he had fallen the unexpected-
ness of the fall had caused them to abet
rather than to hinder his sudden drop
it was a wonder he hadnt broken half
his bones

  he laughed elatedly something real-
ly seemed to be taking care of him it
sent a warm feeling rushing through
him and he swept an eager eye around
him

  the glance startled him the walls of
the room were arrayed in narrow com-
partments and in each of the cell-like
three-sided affairs there stared unblink-
ingly back at him the most hideous of
faces it was a sight that almost
knocked him off his feet

  he crouched with gun in hand ex-
pectantly waiting but those fright-
ful cadaverous visages made no move
toward him their horrid features were
so repellant that mansfield stood rooted
like an inanimate statue but he
couldnt remain thus forever so he
crept closer to the first stall his weap-

on was ready to fire and ready to kill

  a glance inside and he burst into a
laugh that peeled off the ghastly feel-
ing which had covered him during the
past few moments

  they werent live things only mask-
like effigies he paced from cell to cell
and satisfied himself on that point
masks but what forbidding depic-
tions they were enough to make the
blood crawd within you these uncanny
weird faces from every neck there
depended a long robe

  mansfield understood now what they
were gaudy displays of a high priest
which herded superstitious and suscept-
ible blacks into submission and he sir
john mansfield had the fortunate ex-
perience of falling directly into this he
chuckled to himself

  there were dozens of the gruesome
faces all around probably this cham-
ber was entered only by the priest
with almost childish inquisitiveness he
dropped one of them over his head and
paraded around to acquire the feeling
satisfaction dripped from him wait
until he told this to some of his col-
leagues back in england here he
was attired in the regal garment of a
god he could with a gesture decide
the fate of mankind ha ha

  he bolted upright suddenly a voice
came to him faintly in a bound he was
back in the cell standing up still garbed
in the robe with the ugly head he was
just in time

  the slab of stone through which he
had fallen glided back and a black strode
down the steps from within the beastly
mask mansfield envisioned the most
splendid specimen of a body he had
ever seen the negro was fully eight
feet tall if he was an inch his shoul-
ders were like mountain tops charged
with a beauteous graceful ripple

he walked directly to the cell in
which mansfield was concealed gazed


amazing stories

preoccupiedly into it there was a
frown upon the black face

  that noise he murmured audibly
they think it is ra fools i must do
something to steady them they must
realize that i okrulla am endowed with
the smile of the gods

  he turned away from the stall and
moved to another one and mansfield
breathed a silent relief he selected a
fierce face abstractly fixed the robe
and head upon him then departed
through a door at the other end of the
room closing it noiselessly behind him

so that was okrulla what a crea-
ture his countenance was instilled
with hate but it could be plainly seen
that there was a reasoning power behind
that skull he wasnt like the rest of
the race with negligible forehead prog-
nathous jaw that fellow radiated a
fierce will and man power he would
be an uncomely foe to deal with

  mansfield ran to the door through
which he had gone and opened it sur-
reptitiously he saw a large hollow
shell and it was empty lie crept into
it and looked around there sounded
now the booming voice of okrulla with
distinctness he was speaking

  men of the black race of atlantis
the time has come for us to destroy
the white devils and their power i ok-
rulla son of the gods upon whom i be-
stowed their smiling favors have been
chosen to lead you into the land of com-
plete freedom i wear now the sign
of heaven it was draped upon me by
heavenly hands

  mansfield flashed a speculative eye
about him wondering from whence this
came the shell was the inside of some-
thing which he couldnt shape out then
he struck it it was the inside of an
altar and near by there stretched back
the raised dais the ceiling was just
over his head he stood on the plat-

form and looked through the narrow il-
luminated slit an exclamation hissed
through his lips

  he was peering into a large chamber
in which there were many blacks and
right next to him-only the thin wall
separated them-was okrulla in all the
fineries of priesthood his hand was
outstretched toward his people

  no more shall there be bartering
that is over we are to rule by the
grace of the gods bring on the blood
with which the mouth of ra will taste
our sincerity

   ceremonies and religious rites ensued
the entire gathering fell to their knees
and knocked their foreheads against the
cold stone and from their throats there
rose fervent incoherent phrases some
of the fanatics banged their heads with
violence it brought a grin to the face
of the concealed man

  something made mansfield look at his
gun and it was a lucky thing all of
the chambers were full of empty shells
he quickly took them out and refilled the
weapon with fresh cartridges

   and then the towering regalia-deckcd
figure of okrulla rose up the ferocity
of the hideous head was not lost upon
his followers they cowered on their
benches quavered at the least gesticula-
tion of a movable ear eye or tooth
fierce fangs protruded from the mouth
of the mask the priest was truly dis-
played in majestic power at the mo-
ment and the unruly subjects were like
babes under his insidious eye

   bring forth the offering

crom a doorway at the other end of
the chamber there came into view
two blacks dragging someone between
them they must have been waiting
there for the signal it was a white
person mansfield saw from the distance
and his muscles tensed at the sight of
the form dragged over the floor
the lost city



the party reached the center of the

stage right before the altar upon which
okrulla stood sir john mansfields
heart leaped into his throat a quiver
ran down his spine

  it was venia

chapter xiii

a heavenly descent

the girl had suffered much in the
torture chamber her face was
bruised and there were wounds on
her legs and arms she was totally
spent and the black guards were hauling
her without concern

  mansfield rooted to the slit saw her
eyelids flutter saw her eyes stare back
at the great figure upon the dais there
issued no murmur or groan from her
lips but her blue eyes spoke volumes of
utter loathing

  daughter of the high priest rum-
bled the ferocious head your race is
doomed by the gods the black people
have been chosen to lead

  the girl drew herself up in scornful
attitude loosened herself from the
clutches of the scowling blacks on either
side raised a defiant tousled head still
she said nothing

  okrulla laughed creepily it is de-
spoiling the beauty of atlantis to offer
you on the altar but the gods want
you

  venias eyes flashed terror but it died
away just as quickly the englishman
saw her breast rise and fall quickly as
the realization was forced upon her
her mouth became a grim line

  have you something to say  the
priest offered in a slimy voice

  her head tossed back your car-
casses will be fed to the man-eating
matter her soft voice declared

  ha roared the man she dares
  or tbe gods she

dares this offspring of an accursed
people  enough of your blasphemy
to the altar

  brawny arms lifted the fighting strug-
gling girl as though she were but a
child and deposited her upon the silk-
adorned shrine quickly experienced fin-
gers strapped her heaving form securely
to the flat-topped surface her agonized
face was only a few feet away from him
mansfield braced himself for action

  the guards fell back to the benches
and the priest rose to pace the platform
angrily a vituperous stream of hatred
he heaped upon the heads of the white
men of atlantis he cursed them with
a frenzied joy that made the headdress
quiver and the blacks glistened with
the sight of a new-born power almost
in their hands

  the girl was staring wildly at the ges-
turing okrulla when she became startled
at the sound of a whispering voice at her
very ear

  dont turn your head venia dont
let them know that i am here

the girl closed her eyes in joyful
assent she had heard him plain-
ly there came upon her face now a
beautiful expression her drawn coun-
tenance relaxed into a mockery that de-
rided the fanatic speech of the black
priest

  okrulla turned and snatched a long
poinard from his girdle beneath the
robe he began a slithering dance upon
the dais and presently the entire gath-
ering was burst into song an eerie un-
musical chant that pricked the nerves
with horror their faces were not hu-
man any more jowls were slavering for
human blood eyes were rolling to
the avid accompaniment of twitching
muscles

  closer and closer came the dancing
black closer came the upraised arm
which grasped the pointed blade higher


amazing stories

and higher extended the closed fist it
was reaching to a great height ready
to plunge with a lightning streak that
would bring the appeasement of desire
the priest was next to the girl with
venom burning in the masks orbs
the black voices died away in a whis-
per waiting eagerly for the climax move
of the ritual

  the point was directly over the girls
heart she stared fascinatedly at it
without horror without qualm

  ra i bring you the cup bubbling
with our humble offering and the
arm began its swift descent

  the silence in the room was suddenly
split by a terrific yell from a begarbed
figure which had risen from apparently
nowhere and a resounding crack of a
gun the mouth of the priest opened
in surprise only to be the recipient of
the chunk of metal that tore clean
through his head the sleek poniard
dropped from his spasmodic fingers and
fell upon the palpitating bosom of the
girl hilt downward okrula rolled over
the dais and flopped sprawlingly upon
the stone floor

  right before their eyes a miracle had
happened the blacks were looking at
a bulbous head of utter ugliness at a
body from which spat instant death

  it was ra ra okrulla had sacri-
leged his mission upon the earth the
gods had not desired this

  i am ra bow down in repentance
for your deeds said the booming voice

  they dropped prone on their faces
moaning in terror not a face dared to
lift upward bodies groveled seeking
reprieve for their misdeeds pleading in
prayer for condonement

  mansfield stood over the closed eyes
of the girl and looked at her touched
her fair cheek her lids flickered he
bent closer but the hideous garb didnt
frighten her

  sir john her voice almost broke

  good girl spoke the admiring voice
of the rescuer you are a brave girl
swiftly he cut loose the bonds with
the sharp blade he swept the chamber
but the blacks were still groaning fit-
fully his voice boomed out in harsher
tones every head dug deeper

 d lack men of atlantis harken

     ra speaks you have desecrated
your trust upon the earth your priest
okrulla has been a scoundrel he has
sought to rid the land of atlantis of the
white men it was not with my ap-
proval it was prompted by his greed
i have come from my heavenly abode
to save this fair daughter of the high
priest of the white men had you killed
her every single one of you would have
been struck with my noise arise
they rose to their feet and gawked
shamefacedly at the towering head which
had spoken so rebukingly to them the
mention of the noise had brought them
to a quaking stand

  hereafter bring food offerings to
the altar begone with blood

  they filed out quickly daring not
one look backward lest that thundering
voice of the gods strike them down in
a short while the chamber was empty

  mansfield turned to the girl and
helped her down from the death-slab
she clung to him as to a long-lost
brother his strong arm gave support
around her waist he kicked aside the
small panel which led them under the
shrine they entered then he kicked it
shut once more the hollow shell re-
sounded to the echo of their feet

  in the room of the robes mansfield
placed the girl upon a soft lounge tore
off the hideous thing he wore his face
was shining strangely suffused with the
unexpected success

  sir john truly you are a god only
ra could have done what you did
he laughed okrulla is gone venia
the lost city



the blacks are too simple-minded to
defy a religious belief

  she debated the statement do you
know who okrulla was he was the
black whom we captured once and to
whom we gave the brain treatment but
something didnt work out according to
the rules and he disappeared with many
ray-tubes there are several more like
him here who did that it is those
blacks we have to contend with they
forget easily soon they will be trying
to get us again

  so that was the reason for okrullas
reasoning power well he was gone
now and he rather thought the dan-
gerous uprising was over he told it to
the girl but she shook her head

from her he discovered that she had
been captured during the attack upon
atlantis several blacks had masque-
raded as temple servants and had taken
her off during the battle she shuddered
when he asked her of their treatment
only too well did he remember that
chamber which had exacted so much of
her

  presently he glanced down and saw
that she was asleep poor girl he
thought she needed it she was tired
and worn he curled himself up in a
silky robe and sat at the foot of the
lounge in deep thought now that he
had the upper hand he must devise
some means of getting out of there with
her he might be able to play this
role of ra for a while but the effect
would soon wear off amongst the blacks
that wouldnt last forever and this
gun was his chief hold upon the
creatures

  the thing to do he told himself
again was to bend every effort to find
where the outlet of the underground hab-
itat was he realized that it would have
to be a crafty approach the minds
of these fellows wouldnt understand if

the great ra suddenly asked them the
question he must know everything
and he really knew little

  but he was glad now that okrulla
was gone probably he had been the
only one who had ever gone into this
room he would have immediately rec-
ognized that  mask robe which he had
worn would have known that some-
one was resorting to trickery and he
would have been a deadly enemy with
that knowledge

  thinking musing mansfield nodded
and lay down at length for a moment
of relaxation he needed it badly too
his whole body just yearned for a sweet
repose

  some time later he awoke feeling old
strength flowing back into his veins
it had been the first sleep he had had
since that impromptu one up in the
great sphinx-and didnt it feel good
his body clamored for a thing just like
this

  he moved to the shell and looked out
of the slit a smile broke over his
face there was a great platter of food
upon the altar his orders were being
followed out to the word the body of
okrulla had been taken out too a
deep silence pervaded the chamber

  he removed the food and took it into
the inner chamber he awoke venia and
they ate in silence both ate famishedly
a contented sigh falling when they had
had enough

  venia we cant stay here our only
chance to get out of this place is to
get out among the blacks we might
hear something which will show us but
dont ask any questions come don one
of these robes

  it was a good idea she admitted
staying here would lead them nowhere
that was positive he helped her put
on one of the robes adjusting it so that
it didnt drag on the ground then dressed
himself in the ugly garment as be-

stories

fore underneath the garment he
gripped securely the gun ready to draw
the trigger finger back into the speech
of death

  they went out of the shell into the
chamber of the many benches and
walked slowly to the door

  under no condition- whispered
mansfield must you get separated
from me it is our only salvation keep
your eyes open and ill do all the
talking that must be done

  she nodded the grotesque head bob-
bing up and down they left the en-
trance behind them and emerged into
a long corridor several blacks were
lolling there and their eyes popped as
the godly creatures came out of the
chamber of rites they fell upon their
knees in humble subjection others is-
sued from doorways and saw too the
heavenly beings going slowly along and
they responded also with obsequious
bows

the two moved along without a
word occasionally prying into a
chamber they paid little attention to
the black men and women who flattened
themselves out at their appearance on
and on they promenaded then mans-
field caught a glimpse of the stairway
which led downward to the lower paths
the one he had rushed up ahead of his
pursuers

  he nudged the girl this might lead
us somewhere i know there are lots
of blacks below might hear something

  they started down at one place
the bend in the flight he saw the cloth
in front of the alcove through which
he had been catapulted he couldnt
resist pulling it to one side and scruti-
nizing the slab which moved inward to
the priests sanctuary in some manner
he must have exerted pressure upon the
right spot it was a wonder the blacks
hadnt discovered this before

  down in the corridor beneath they
found many blacks and their sudden
entrance brought a hush which was an-
swered only by the lowering of the
heads the great deity ra was walk-
ing amongst them the supreme god
of all the beastly visage adorning
mansfield scowled ferociously but inside
tliere was a smile

  they came to a doorway and mans-
field felt the arm on his side quiver
with a shudder he gazed up askance
forgetting that he couldnt read that in-
human face then he understood it
was the torture chamber orientating his
position by it he gazed down the length
of the passage and saw that the pit of
horror was down at the other end

  mansfield tried to figure this out it
stood to reason that if there were an
exit out of this place it would be at a
high level and not down here-some-
where at the highest elevation but
where was that in the labyrinth of
corridors it was a trying task to figure
anything out like this hed better get
up and search the upper passages

  then a shriek split his eardrums and
he whirled the corridor was empty
the girl had vanished in some stealthy
manner venia had disappeared again
that scream rent the atmosphere but
this time it ceased suddenly as though
the voice had been choked into silence

chapter xiv

doomed

mansfield cursed himself for
the fool he was venia had
been right the blacks were
never to be trusted they were danger-
ous at all times and he the dupe that
he had been had been led on by their
silly demonstrations and had trusted that
they were believing him to be ra all
the time he had been drawing the girl
the lost city



and himself closer and closer into their net

  it was plain now they were afraid
of his gun it was easy for them to
know beneath which robe he was and
artfully they stole the girl right from
his side they had been afraid to
tamper with him he spat death too
viciously

  ra these bestial minds accepted no
deity he told himself scornfully they
might be easily frightened but only
for the moment nothing could sub-
jugate these brutes for any length of
time

  the capture again of venia had hap-
pened so spontaneously that he didnt
know where to turn for the moment
he clutched his weapon with a fierce
grip swept the corridor about him with
a swift scrutiny it was bare of all life
then like a streak he sped down to the
end of the passage to the chamber of
the circular pit of the man-eating gray
matter

  it was familiar ground he trod on
now not so very long before he had
scuttled down this very passage like a
trapped beast and had succeeded in free-
ing himself and coming out on top rut
now it was a different matter there
was a lump in his throat at the thought
of that scream which had suddenly
stopped at the thought of the danger
the girl might be in now and all due
to his abominable carelessness she
might be dead by this time the black
devils were desperate they wouldnt
take chances any more a defenseless
girl meant nothing to their crooked
minds a prayer broke from his lips
for her safety

  he flung aside the cloth from the
ante-room of the pit of doom and
immediately he had his hands full

  there were a half dozen blacks there
armed with clubs apparently waiting
for him the moment he bounded into
the room they fell like a scourge upon

him his gun barked once and the fore-
most black fell backward stumbling
into two who were right behind him
knocking them both off their feet the
flashing eyes of the scientist saw a heavy
club swing toward his head with crush-
ing intent he tried to leap out of the
way but did not succeed it crashed
into him

  he had okrulla to thank for the
negligible damage the wooden club did
the headdress was composed of a
strong material that made the club
bounce right up again and out of the
wielders hands the tight-fitting cap
of metal bore the full brunt of the blow
which hardly dazed the white man

mansfield tore the robe away
from his shoulders freeing his
firing arm for better use once again
the gun barked and another black
pitched to the ground two negroes
were now on the floor one pawing the
air and with distorted face-the other
flattened against the stone

  the blacks were nerved to fight it
out to a finish they wanted badly to
rid themselves of this man with the
noisy thing in his hands who still had
the hideous head perched atop of him
but their very own eyes had seen what
had happened to two of them after the
same number of loud cracks it was
disheartening to pile in against such an
incomprehensible factor of supernatural
deadliness yet with cries of abandon
they flew at him to get in a finishing
blow their shrieks of rage cluttered
up the room

  but this was what mansfield liked
now at close quarters he couldnt
miss hitting their bodies the only
thing which might worry him was that
his gun would be emptied and more
of the blacks would rush in before he
could refill the chambers but that was
a passing fear


amazing stories

  the blacks could stand no more of
it after two more of them crashed to
the ground they dashed for the door
and plunged out head-first

  mansfield leaped over the fallen bodies
and brought up against the panel a
swift glance into it and a fearful cry
burst from his throat

  venia

  the girl was lying on the slope her
fingers holding tightly to the edge of
the narrow ledge her eyes were shot
with terror slowly she was slipping
downward her white hands bleeding
from the fierce but impossible attempt
to clutch securely

  at the sound of his voice she looked
up at his grotesque head silhouetted
in the opening her lips trying to form
some word but mansfield didnt need
that word to see what she was going
through he slammed the gun into the
holster and in the same motion was
through the panel-just as the girl let
go and commenced to slide down to a
horrible death

  in a twinkling he tore off his cumber-
some sham of a masked head and he
cast it out toward the center of the pit
then he threw himself face downward
on the narrow ledge and then gradually
slid off the rim upon the decline his feet
behind him ramming hard into the un-
yielding rock he now let his upper part
of the body sway slowly carefully rig-
idly his arms stretched far out to the
slowly sliding girl

  she was skidding down and down and
her eyes were wide open to the attempt
of the englishman her fingers kept
pace with her descent by rubbing per-
spiring lines in the slope and then she
began to gain momentum

mansfields torso was now
fully out over the ledge his eyes
stared unafraidly at the circular pit
which now looked so dreadfully close

with one hand braced under him he
shot out the other to the girl and venia
desperation forcing her to her utmost
to stop the maddening glide gave a sud-
den leap if it failed the next moment
would see her shoot down at a speedy
pace with but one end but it was her
only chance

  her fingers fell into the outstretched
palm of mansfield the moment that
bleeding soft hand dropped into his
a vise encircled it it stopped altogether
the fall of the girl but it pulled him out
of position and he felt his feet give
way behind him for a moment he was
positive that it was all over then the
loosened feet again held and he was
secure with the girl in his strong grasp

  but safety was far from being a
fact there remained yet the arduous
job of getting both of them out of the
precarious position neither was in a
shape to move around without drastic
result

  mansfield thinking hard and fast felt
that there was only one thing to do
hed lie like this and brace hard with
his hands he might be able to work the
girl up and past and over him in that
way she might be raised until her hands
once more reached the ledge and she was
able to get back upon it

  quickly he outlined the plan to her
and she nodded briefly with understand-
ing his tense hands pulled her up inch
by inch until he was grasping her around
her waist then she was able to move
up on her own power once she slid
back for a short distance but he halted
that immediately those steely muscles
dug into her without regard he knew
he hurt her in a short while the soles
of her sandals flicked by his sight and
disappeared

  he heard her laboring breath pant
ive got it

  then came two small but powerful
hands wrapped around his ankles and in
the lost city



a jiffy he was back upon the ledge the
girl dropped upon it in exhaustion de-
vouring him with eyes full of thanks
her face was drawn with the suffer-
ing she had undergone

  mansfield made as though to sit down
next to her when a blood-curdling yell
came from behind him he whirled
and saw a leering countenance in the
panel a negro stood there club in
hand sneering at them

  ra tis none else but the stranger
he escaped once from the pit but
now-

aloud rising cackle burst from
him as he slammed shut the open-
ing just as the scientist lunged at it
from behind it there died away the
throaty high-pitched voice

  mansfields balled fist could make
no indentation against that resolute
rock and with a shrug of his shoulders
he turned away from it and looked at
the girl

  venia do you know where we are

  her blonde head nodded it is the
man-eating matter i know for the
blacks copied this chamber from the
one in which we imprison dangerous
negroes

  then you know what this means
well be kept here until we slip from
exhaustion down there

  she didnt reply but leaned with back
against the wall and clasped her arms
about her knees her blonde hair was
a sheen from which sparkled the tiny
drops of irradiating beams from the
walls

                                                                       

  and then something came over mans-
field something which had never hap-
pened to his manly life before he
wanted of a sudden to take that beauti-
ful courageous daughter of the high
priest in his arms and caress her his
heart was trembling strangely the girls
drawn eyes were staring imseeingly into

space it molded her features into a
classic piece of sculptured marble each
contour each line was perfectly chis-
eled she seemed to have matured blos-
somed into superbness within a brief
interval

  sir john she said without turning
to him if we ever get out of here
the white men of atlantis will revere
you more than ever before since your
coming many unbelievable things have
occurred you have fought with your
own life for our welfare does your
land contain all of your type

  he wanted to tell her that any living
man given one look at her would have
laid his life down in her defense but
she was so serious in her statement that
he could say nothing

  the girl searched his face under an
intensifying study your land is one
place i would have liked to see if it
bears your mankind it must be heaven
to live in

  mansfield had to turn away from her
keen look it embarrassed him he
changed the topic with where is the
entrance to this hole you must have
seen it when they brought you down

  she shook her head they blind-
folded me i dont know where they
led me in

  mansfield didnt understand it as he
had reasoned before it seemed probable
that the opening would be somewhere in
the upper corridors it appeared logical
the higher one got the closer he would
get to the upper ground he knew that
the entrance was through the cellar in
which he had been captured but where
that led to down here was an enigma

tttiat caused him to think of that
  when there was no chance for
them to be freed of this pit was it
that he wouldnt-couldnt give up in
the face of insurmountable odds-because
of the girl lie glanced at her and


amazing stories

something caught him up confound
it why had she been forced into all
this-such a beautiful thing it wasnt
his sense of justice he wouldnt mind
it much if he had to figure it all out
were he the only one but her presence
made his every move heavy with weighty
precision nothing he did could be
wrong from now on he hadnt him-
self to think of

  he could easily read the resignation
on venias face there was something
about the man-eating stuff that cowed
every soul in atlantis black or wthite
in spite of the rays which controlled it
it was an indefinably conclusive essence
which could not be dealt with or hoped
against its malignant overpowering
effect- was final

  still he told himself grimly he
couldnt give up the blacks held the
upper hand now but he didnt forget
that he had once escaped from this
very same spot those fellows would
keep them down here without food or
water until they became incredibly weak
then with nothing to support their fail-

ing arms and legs they would slide
down in some moment of unwariness
that was the way this pit of doom
worked

 how many hours passed thus in
thought he did not know the silence
and stillness of the chamber was work-
ing on him he didnt want to get
up on his feet lest he totter he had
been staring too long at that lighted
circle in the concave center of the
chamber for his own good it had him
dizzy

  the idea had been lurking in his brain
for some time before he found himself
aware of it he gnawed at it it was
the only thing they could do it had
to succeed

  he sat at the side of the sleeping
girl holding her hand lest some slight
movement in her slumber would send
her tumbling over the side venia was
sleeping so peacefully that he was re-
luctant to awake her but the success
of the idea was dependent upon being
in readiness and the opportunity might
pass while she slept he awakened her

by abner j gelula

the rather impressive illustration which our readers have before them
will give a sort of clue to this wonderfully interesting story in which is
involved a very ingenious bit of human nature and which tells how under
the conditions described which seem terrible at first sight good was

eventually brought about

illustrated by morey

the emergency session of the
league of nations broke up
in wild disorder the impas-
sioned pleas of the chairman
urging the representative na-
tions to continue arbitration for an ami-
cable settlement of the territorial dispute
fell uponjdeaf ears the peace of continen-
tal europe as well as the very existence
of the league itself hung in the balance

  for thirty-seven years the league of
nations had functioned in the regulation
of international questions even among
major powers the judgment of the world
court had been respected questions
of rights had come before the interna-
tional tribunal before and always the dis-
puting nations abided by the decisions
handed down the comparative peace
that reigned for more than a third of a
century had almost established itself and
a feeling of security had taken root

  but now a new generation held the
reins-a generation who knew only of
the glamour of war and nothing of its
tribulations time had greatly eased
financial woes so that again the talk of
increasing armies and building navies
could be resumed without the presence
of an annoying financial spectre in fact

the cost of war might now even be less
than the cost of previous war if the
consideration of possible damage to prop-
erty by the enemy is excluded a mod-
ern war should be fought in the air-
and planes cost almost nothing compared
with the mammoth cumbersome battle-
ships formerly used and the infantry
which was still recognized as the back-
bone of the army would find it
comparatively easy-going under the
sheltering barrage of long-range guns
bombing-planes and gas screcns

  the chairman of the league despite
his realization that any further effort to
induce a continuance of arbitration was
futile pounded his gavel for order but
his entreaties were as the chirp of a
canary in a boiler factory the league
of nations had failed

  morton hardy unofficial representa-
tive of the united states sat in the side-
lines quietly watching the impetuous
activity of the membership absent-
mindedly he drew an empty pipe from
his pocket and placed it firmly between
his teeth nothing can stop them he
murmured he ran his fingers through
his greying hair and sighed as if the
responsibility for the entire proceedings

rested upon his shoulders it demanded
no keen powers of observation to see
that war was imminent-a war that
again threatened to engulf all of europe
if not every nation of the world

  during the height of the demonstra-
tion while delegates of the major powers
of europe flung gauntlets of defiance
into the tribunal hardy bent his head
slightly toward a colleague who sat be-
side him commenting the league of
nations never could and never shall be-
come a force for world peace until it
possesses within itself the power to en-
dorse its demands-a police department
so to speak-to make the bad little na-
tions be good

  and it was only a matter of weeks
after the hectic adjournment of the
league that the first shot was fired and
continental europe again found itself in
flames battle lines guarded by a new
generation of youth declared the advent
of another war-fiercer more deadly
more horrible than any war in the his-
tory of man-a war fought according
to the dictates of a modernized science
it was a war of engineers and death-
dealing machines-a war that threat-
ened the very roots of civilization

i

the entrance of the united states
into the melee also appeared immi-
nent an embargo placed upon united
states ships in several foreign ports in-
dicated an early active participation in
the hostilities

  hardy had returned to washington
there was little more that he could
officially report than that which was
already common knowledge through the
newspapers the league had failed in
the face of an overwhelming desire for
war he stated simply there was noth-
ing that it could do about it the entire
situation had resolved to the mere in-
sinuation stop us if you can the
entire procedure had made a deep im-

pression upon the man although not
a pacifist in any sense of the word he
realized only too well the fact that mod-
ernized warfare would no longer confine
itself to the mere slaughter of troops-
that entire cities would be annihilated
civilian populations wiped out and dis-
ease and famine would follow in the
path of the new scientific war god just
as surely as it had in every conflict since
the days of mars

  through his access into the inner
circles of washington hardy spared
nothing in the use of his every influence
to lessen the extent of the catastrophe
but his efforts were futile-puny in the
face of the efforts of others who under
the guise of patriotism saw immediate
gain or personal glorification in the open-
ing of hostilities and beneath veiled
innuendoes advocated it

  hardy drew more to himself as days
went by and the fever of patriotism
spread over the country his favorite
haunt was the exclusive arts and
sciences club in washington where
in the quiet of the spacious reading room
that overlooked the meticulously trimmed
grass bordering the potomac he could
dream of a world that truly sought for
peace and pursued the ways of content-
ment

  a book through which he had been
idly glancing lay carelessly upon his lap
as he gazed at the small gun-boat that
basked sleepily in the potomac beneath
the ray of a warm june sun the arrival
of someone in the room brought him
abruptly back into a more material world
he turned to see who had entered

  ah there you are hardy i thought
id find you here mcclellan chief of
staff of the bureau of entomology ad-
dressed him they were old friends and
hardy rather liked that kindly old man
this regard for him might have been
due to his vocation hardy once thought
for his entire life had been spent in


amazing stories

aiding mankind to utilize science in
making living happier instead of more
unbearable he was sure that if mc-
clellan were an army officer he would
not have cared so much for him often
as a side interest hardy would visit
the old man in the extensive research
laboratories of the bureau and for hours
would listen interestedly to the savants
explanation of the value of some tiny
insect pinned beneath the powerful
lenses of a microscope or about the work
of the bureau in its efforts to cope with
some particular species of insect that
might be playing especial havoc with the
nations crops these visits afforded
hardy a relaxation for it carried him
off into another world-a world where
numbers constituted strength and by
these numbers alone presented the great-
est single menace to mankind

i

another man whose pleasant face
 hardy seemed to recognize accom-
panied the scientist he tried to recall
just where he had seen him before but
the introduction soon filled the gap in
his memory

  hardy the entomologist began i
want you to meet the greatest living
authority on insects professor milton
kingsley professor kingsley doesnt
get to washington often mcclennan
declared by way of acquainting the two
with one another so we try to show
him around properly when he does come
our way

  the two men shook hands in greeting
turning to the visitor mcclellan con-
tinued mr hardy of whom you have
no doubt heard is one of americas
prominent diplomats he has just re-
turned from geneva where he witnessed
the upset of the league of nations but
aside from his diplomatic abilities he is
profoundly interested in entomology
professor kingsley smiled your
two interests are quite well removed from

each other he commented good-na-
turedly from the politics of men to
the instincts of insects   

  hardy chuckled yes the two have
quite a gap between them but that is
all the more reason for my interest after
watching the ways of men it is quite
sible to study the ways of more lowly
creatures

  the two men had seated themselves
and mcclellan asked to be excused for
an hour or so to attend an important
meeting

  the trend of conversation between the
diplomat and the scientist soon turned
to their common interest and to the sub-
ject of the famed control that kingsley
had established for the farmer saving
millions of dollars in crops each year

  hardy was glad to talk of anything
that would aid him in forgetting inter-
national troubles and complications he
listened eagerly to the professors learned
discourse regarding certain tests he had
made on the relative strength of insects

  the wonder of nature cannot truly
be appreciated unless one considers how
artfully she has scaled down the strength
of her creatures the application of the
law of diminishing proportions he said
can you imagine the consequences if
man for instance possessed the propor-
tionate strength of an insect i have
conducted tests along these lines and the
findings are astounding-hard scientific
facts that might almost appear ridicu-
lous

  hardy nodded his head appreciatively

  consider the ordinary black ant for
instance the professor continued that
tiny creature that abounds all over east-
ern north america such an insect
under test traveling with a dead spider
in its jaws the victim weighing more
than twice its captor ran vertically for
two feet in a fraction under two seconds
it measured one-fourth of an inch in
length if a racing automobile could
peace weapons



travel as fast in proportion it would
attain a speed in excess of  miles
per hour and a locomotive proportion-
ately could make the new york to los
angeles run in just slightly more than

	hours why if this insect were
the size of a man it would be by far the
most powerful creature on earth

  then reflect upon the capacities of
the ordinary beetle who finds no difficulty
in exerting a pulling-force ef  times
its own weight on this basis a man
could easily drag a block of granite
weighing  tons and the grasshopper
just an inch in length leaps  feet with
a minimum exertion that grasshopper
if it possessed the proportions of a man
would leap a distance of four city
blocks

the professor halted his discourse
ive never quite considered the
insect in that light before hardy de-
clared how fortunate man is that he
doesnt have to worry about warring
against such monsters goodness knows
the machines that man invents to kill
his fellow men are bad enough

  well now i dont know the pro-
fessor drawled slowly i am firmly of
the opinion that the insect in its present
tiny state is far more of a menace than
if it were the size of animals the
difficulty in entomology has been in the
proper study of the insect his very
size is his most potent weapon but i
think things may be a bit different
now 

  the professors demeanor seemed to
change suddenly as he neared a point
in his discourse that apparently bordered
upon forbidden ground his eyes
gleamed in enthusiastic anticipation he
rubbed his hands together as he re-
peated words that trailed off into noth-
ingness things may be a bit different

                  

now   

  hardy was visibly curious but pro-

priety forbade pressing the professor for
an explanation of his mysterious phrase
yet he ventured a question that might
draw him out a bit

  so you feel that now you have found
a way of definitely aiding the more min-
ute study of the insects

  professor kingsley turned and looked
at his questioner for several seconds
without speaking then he began
slowly

  you are a friend of dr mcclellans
and a trusted diplomat in the service of
our government theres no reason why
i cant tell you yes- mr hardy i
shall tell you you shall be signally hon-
ored mr hardy for you shall be the
very first to know of my discovery it
is because of my discovery that i am here
in washington but no one knows that
that is the reason for my visit-yet

  he leaned forward in the heavy leath-
er-covered chair and dragged it an inch
closer to hardy his voice dropped to
almost a whisper

  i have eliminated the need of the
microscope in entomological study he
began instead of peering through a
glass to magnify the insect i have dis-
covered the means of increasing the size
of the insect itself i can study an insect
as a vivisectionist studies an animal i
have discovered the secret of insect
growth

  hardys eyes widened perceptibly a
man of kingsleys standing would make
no idle boasts he listened scarcely
believing yet forced to believe on the
reputation of the man

  i can enlarge the insect he added
many times-hundreds of times an
ant as big as a dog a beetle as big as
a horse a wasp like an airplane a
spider that spreads its hairy legs across
a boulevard i have done it hardy
and you are the first except for my
daughter who has aided me in my ex-
periments to know about it think-


amazing stories

think how simple it will be to study  

something flashed across hardys
mind as he listened entranced to the
staccato-description of the mammoth
bugs was such a thing possible if any-
one other than so eminent a personage as
dr kingsley had told him of such a
thing he would have laughed it off as
mere nonsense if this were true   

  he clutched the professors arm

  are you sure that no one knows of
this he asked almost fiercely

  the professor assured him that it
would not be made public for several
days yet-at least until a demonstration
had been given but why this sudden
agitation what difference could it
possibly make if some one did know
about it

  pardon professor kingsley hardy
said apologetically the possibilities of
your discovery quite overwhelmed me
for the moment i believe that i see a
future for your discovery that you
scarcely imagined it is great stupen-
dous but it demands the utmost se-
crecy for if what you describe is actual
fact civilization shall never forget you
as its greatest benefactor

  the professor was puzzled the man
spoke in circles his languid frame had
suddenly taken on an abundance of en-
ergy and he was clearly agitated about
the discovery

  hardy waxed serious professor as
a member of the diplomatic service of
our government i beg that you keep
this discovery secret it means more-a
thousand times more-to humanity than
all the crops in the world no one else
must learn of this until a later date i
cannot advance the reason now but you
must trust me that i am working for
your benefit as well as for all the world
please i beg of you give me your
solemn promise that no one shall yet
learn of this matter

  the professor looked at him quizzical-
ly but refrained from further question-
ing the reason for this sudden all-ab-
sorbing interest in his discovery he
felt pleased however in the display of
importance attached to it and pledged
his word of secrecy

  and now mr hardy if you would
care to be my house guest for a week
or so i shall be happy to demonstrate
that what i have told you is no boast or
exaggeration

  hardy leaped at the proffered invita-
tion

further conversation was inter-
rupted by the arrival of a young
lady accompanied by a man the girl
was introduced by the professor as his
daughter doris the man albert
blake a member of the staff of the bu-
reau of entomology was known to both
men he had been acting as a guide to
miss kingsley this being the girls ini-
tial trip to the capitol city

  we had been wondering what hap-
pened to you doris said addressing her
father but dr mcclellan told us where
you were so we thought that you might
like to join us in our sight-seeing trip
the professor declined graciously and
the girl followed by blake strolled over
to a large window to better view the
scene that spread before them

  hardy had been doing some rapid
thinking a new enthusiasm filled him
he had an idea it was different radi-
cal drastic but he was certain that it
would be effective-if only that which
the professor had described to him
proved to be an actual fact he was
studying blake he might fit perfectly
into the plan hardy spoke quietly to the
professor

  if i might impose upon your hospi-
tality he said may i ask that the
young entomologist blake be invited to
attend the demonstration at your home
peace weapons



  the professor was visibly puzzled by
this request it was only a few minutes
before that he had sworn him to secrecy
and now he asked that a subordinate of
the bureau witness the demonstration
if he had asked that mcclellan attend
it might be understandable but blake
 he assured hardy however that the
man would be entirely welcome

  hardy extended the invitation to blake
and he accepted with an alacrity that
made his sidelong glance toward the girl
full of meaning her face beamed a
cordial welcome questions of how he
might secure leave of absence from the
bureau were solved by the assurances of
the diplomat

  hardy made it his business that eve-
ning to locate blake at his home there
in the privacy of his room hardy spoke
to the young man

  you are no doubt puzzled regarding
the reason for this invitation to the home
of professor kingsley hardy began

  blake had been more than puzzled a
man of the standing of morton hardy
to ask his company on a trip to the home
of so eminent a scientist as professor
kingsley it was beyond understanding

  well i didnt come to tell you i
came here this evening blake to deter-
mine whether my judgment that you are
a young man of ambition and foresight
and ideal is correct if i am wrong the
invitation is cancelled

  blake peered at the man intently thus
far his conversation had been most mys-
terious there was no reply

  but i am sure that my judgment is
not in error hardy hastened to add
your record at the bureau is most
satisfactory-you see i have been looking
you up

  we leave to-morrow for the home of
professor kingsley a farm situated
about  miles from boise idaho but
before we go i want to have an earnest

talk with you this trip blake may be
the beginning of the greatest chapter in
the history of mankind we are going
to watch professor kingsley conduct an
experiment-an experiment such as no
being has ever witnessed before i shall
not tell you what is its object for if it
is a success you shall know of it if it
is a failure just charge this trip up to
a pleasant vacation

  hardy paused the quizzical expres-
sion that held blakes features had seem-
ingly frozen to his face as yet he knew
little more than he knew before

  but to-night before i leave i want
your solemn promise that whatever sub-
sequent action may develop from this
demonstration you shall consider your-
self a soldier in an army composed of
one man-yourself you shall not be
asked to do anything that i myself will
not do but that does not minimize the
possible danger is it agreed

  blake hesitated only a moment you
may rely on me sir he replied firmly

  fine fine hardy smiled then his
face again assumed a serious solemnity

  just one more thing blake swear
to me that until i release you from this
oath you shall never describe or repeat
anything that you may see hear or learn
at the home of professor kingsley dur-
ing this trip

  i swear it he vowed fervently

it was a few days later that hardy
and blake were seated in the labora-
tory in the home of professor kingsley
silently watching the savant begin his
fearful demonstration and eagerly listen-
ing to his enthusiastic words of explana-
tion from a nearby incubator he drew
an insect

  just a common black ant he de-
clared which i shall place in this small
cardboard box and he fitted the action
to the words he placed the box care-


amazing stories



fully on one side of the laboratory table

  from a shelf overhead he removed
several bottles and with minute exact-
ness he proceeded to pour some of the
contents of each into a test tube care-
fully measuring three drops of a final
liquid he breathed a sigh of satisfac-
tion he held the crystal-clear fluid up
to the light

  here it is gentlemen the professor
proclaimed as he looked up at the tube
almost worshipfully the elixir of mag-
nification 

  he picked up a medicine-dropper and
carefully drew part of the contents of
the tube without speaking he signalled
for the two men to draw closer to wit-
ness the procedure he removed the lid
of the cardboard box disclosing the ant
crouched in a corner slowly waving its
antenna as if sensing some possible dan-
ger bringing the dropper close to the
insect he carelessly dropped a portion of
the fluid directly upon it it squirmed
a moment then lay sill the professor
replaced the lid of the box and then
turned to his guests

  a growth gland is affected the sci-
entist explained but just which one or
where it may be located in that tiny body
i have as yet been unable to determine
but the chemical speeds up the action of
this gland to such an extent that in
twelve hours that tiny ant will-well you
shall see to-morrow morning

  after all he continued everything
rests in glandular control why is it
that with all life originating with the
cell that one cell may develop into an
elephant and another of equal original
size became this little black ant sci-
ence may never know why but it now
has learned to control this growth-or
shall i say uncontrol it happily how-
ever with the exertion of this growth-
gland reproduction of the species is
halted

  the professor then led the way into
a rear yard of the house and deposited
the box on the concrete floor of a minia-
ture garage-like structure carefully he
bolted the door of the building and the
three men returned to the house

  in the morning gentlemen the pro-
fessor said we shall find something
more interesting in the chamber but as
a word of warning you must satisfy
yourself with viewing the live specimen
through the heavy glass window in the
wall it would be neither healthy nor
pleasurable to face it in the open he
chuckled

there was little sleep for either
hardy or blake that night antici-
pation of what the morning promised
found both awake with the first grey light
of dawn hardy arose and proceeded to
dress slowly for he was sure that the
professor would not arise so early

  his bedroom window overlooked he
rear yard and he casually glanced out-
side while he dressed his eye was sud-
denly arrested by a movement in the in-
distinct light of the early morning and
he peered through the grev haze

  an involuntary shudder ran through
his frame his eyes wandered to the
concrete chamber and he stood trans-
fixed as he gazed at the wide-open door
again he looked toward the moving ob-
ject in the yard the clearing light left
no doubt of what it was-there it stood
the tiny black ant in horrible mammoth
proportions-fully three feet high and
almost six feet long it was calmly nib-
bling a near by bush that its huge scythe-
like mandibles had cut down with the
force of a reaper

  there was no time to be lost he
called to blake hurrying to the win-
dow hardy pointed to the monster that
squatted contentedly munching the greens
he stifled a cry of amazement at the
peace weapons



sight that met his eyes call the pro
fessor he cried

  professor kingsley realizing more
clearly than either of the two men the
terrible danger of allowing the giant in-
sect to be at large fairly leaped into his
trousers and shoes and hurried down
the stairs

  this is liable to be dangerous he
warned hardy and blake as he handed
each a long heavy iron bar but we
must kill it at any cost

  the three men cautiously made their
way into the yard and under the pre-
arranged direction of the professor sur-
rounded the creature who thus far had
seemingly taken no notice of their ap-
proach

  then suddenly it seemed to recognize
their presence fearlessly it turned to
face each of the men in turn as if un-
decided which might prove the most
worthy adversary its actions were light-
ning-swift its expressionless multiple
eyes gave no inkling of what plan it
might be conjuring in its over-grown in-
sect brain each man held himself tense
and ready

acting under the professors com-
mands the men slowly closed in
then suddenly with an incredible speed
the giant ant charged directly toward
hardy the man was prepared for such
an attack and bracing himself he poised
the long iron rod directly for the head
the other two meanwhile had jumped
into action and with terrific force crashed
the rods upon the head and back of the
monster a distinct metallic ring issued
from the impact against the steel-hard
shell but the blows came too late
hardys rod had pierced an eye but the
insect had seemingly taken no notice of
it with a vicious click of its mandi-
bles the ant fairly pounced upon the man
carrying him down beneath its almost

crushing weight the mandibles con-
tinued to click maliciously as if in prep-
aration for a final victory

  hardy overcome with horror fought
a losing battle against the vise-like
clutches of the giant only the blows
being rained upon it by kingsley and
blake had distracted its attention suffi-
ciently to delay his fatal contact with
those flashing jaws

  concentrating their attack on the vital
and less-protected thorax of the insect
blake finally delivered a blow that al-
most severed the head and brought a con-
vulsive end to the offensive campaign of
the mammoth creature

  with difficulty the two men pushed
the still-quivering body of the insect off
the unconscious hardy and removed him
to the house bleeding profusely from
the superficial wounds inflicted by the
powerful appendages of the insect and
suffering seriously from shock it was
a week before he had recovered suffi-
ciently to rise from bed

  but time had not been lost hardy had
been laying his plans there no longer
remained the slightest doubt regarding
the potential possibilities of the profes-
sors discovery although the scientist had
not considered any further practical ap-
plication of his elixir than for the easier
and more detailed entomological study
the daring plan that hardy outlined
made him gasp in astonishment

  the professor blake and doris were
called into the room where he lay propped
up in bed that they should be called
thus together proclaimed the advent of
some startling revelation-the imminent
possibility that perhaps now hardy would
reveal the reason for his enthusiastic and
mysterious interest in the professors dis-
covery

  i shall soon be as well as ever hardy
began slowly and then our real work
shall begin i shall need your help-


amazing stories

your loyal unswerving courageous sup-
port in the accomplishment of a purpose
that means the salvation of mankind i
know what is going on in the govern-
ments of the world-and among the
seething masses of easily-led citizenry
we are on the brink of another world
war it is inescapable it shall come
as surely as to-morrow shall come but
this war may be the last war for civili-
zation can never survive its onslaught

  the three listened in awe scarcely
breathing lest they interrupt the infor-
mation that hardy proceeded to impart

  but if we analyze the situation we
ask what makes for war and the
logical answer returns international
jealousies and hatreds and greed as
long as human beings inhabit the earth
human nature must remain constant-
it was the same in the early ages of
man and it is the same to-day in his
higher more complex civilization it is
impossible to ever halt war by hoping
to eradicate these basic attributes of
man only one hope exists-provide a
common enemy then there would be no
wars no international hatreds no whole-
sale murder if there could arise before
humanity a foe that all nations alike
feared

  war would cease to exist if idealists
alone instead of militarists had the
power to declare war mere man-made
boundaries would cease to exist if the
common boundary of humanitys exist-
ence on earth were threatened man
has not yet reached the point in his civili-
zation where he can respect an imma-
terial sentiment as sufficient reason to
remain peaceful that is why the league
of nations cannot enforce its demands
for peace but the league of nations
could enforce its demands if-

hardy paused a moment as if fear-
ful of telling too much then he
continued

  but now the league can enforce
its demands he cried exultantly dont
you see-cant you realize-the league
shall become a force for everlasting
world peace for it now has its police
department not gas not explosives
not huge armies or armaments shall en-
sure the peace of the future but the
lowly insect-the things that crawl and
creep-shall be the enemy that all men
shall cringe before  

the customs inspector at brest
france where the liner docked
scratched his head questioningly he was
puzzled just what four entomologists
could find in this war-ridden country
was more than he could understand he
eyed them closely obviously the first
thought to enter his mind was that they
might be spies-but that possibility was
soon dismissed from his thoughts when
he peered into the contents of a small
leather case that the professor carried
and opened upon request the case
divided into numerous compartments
was a seething mass of insects-bugs of
every kind and species the inspector
hurriedly closed the bag and passed the
four through

  the professor hardy blake and
doris made their way to a paris hotel
where they engaged a suite of rooms on
an upper floor hardy immediately
searched the room thoroughly for any
dictaphonic apparatus that might have
been installed for the benefit of an oc-
cupant whose international integrity
the government could in any way ques-
tion satisfied that there was no eaves-
dropping being done hardy proceeded
to unpack his grip and suggested that
the others do likewise with theirs

  you have the newspaper correspond-
ents credentials that i secured for you 
hardy inquired of blake the young
man produced them well be sure that
they are in your pocket from now on
peace weapons



hardy cautioned and then he continued
and you doris you have your cre-
dentials and your y m c a hostess
uniform all ready

  right here she replied pointing to
her suitcase

  fine fine he commented enthusias-
tically and you my dear professor
you are guarding well the common
enemy 

  the professor nodded slowly seated
in a corner of the reception room the
scientist silently drew upon an unlighted
pipe held tightly between his clenched
teeth his eyes dreamily surveyed the
carpeted floor his face bore an ex-
pression of grim indecision slowly his
eyes lifted in an introspective contem-
plation of hardy

   i wonder hardy if you actually
realize the possible consequences of your
mad plan kingsley spoke as if merely
thinking aloud do you imagine that
you can control these insects like so many
soldiers i have agreed to your plan
only because i have implicit confidence in
your ideal but i must again warn you
after the insects have been impregnated
it shall be too late to reconsider

  hardy smiled whatever the danger
involved however great the risk may
be we must not falter now he looked
at the professor closely remember
nothing we may do can ever be as fierce
or as cruel or as relentless as the war
now raging not many miles distant on
a half-dozen fronts after all a small
poison to counteract a more deadly po-
tion is not to be despised

  hardy picked up the paris edition of
the new york herald that lay on a table
in the room screaming headlines told
of the thousands of men women and
children killed on the previous night by
an enemy air raid over london gas
and shrapnel had taken its toll hardy
read the account aloud and the war
is only beginning he said how long

can civilization stand under such a pro-
longed onslaught

the diplomat paused a moment
come come now he urged we
must look into the future with hope
not with fear there is work to be
done tomorrow must see our ambitions
well upon the road to realization
blake and doris went out later in
the evening they walked the main
streets of paris for an hour enthralled
by the sights and not a little affected by
the distinct atmosphere of war that
seemed to saturate the very air it moved
blake however to voice a fear to doris
for her safety in the undertaking planned
for the morrow

  but you do not seem to realize the
extreme danger to which you will be
exposed he declared earnestly

  but she minimized the peril involved
and waived his concern for her safety

  i ought to make him stop this whole
crazy idea he suddenly exclaimed
hotly why he has no right to ask
that you possibly sacrifice your life for
a hopeless ideal

  but she pacified him with the assur-
ance that she could well take care of her-
self under such circumstances

  what we shall do to-morrow is more
noble and less perilous than answering
a nations call to arms she answered
simply to desert our cause now would
be to shatter the hope of world peace
forever after this war there shall
never be another-whether we carry out
our plan or not but if our hopes are
realized the permanent peace that will
ensue shall be under the banner of civi-
lization-a banner that will be torn to
shreds if our plan fails

  blake silently concurred

  the professor had remained in the
room with hardy that evening care-
fully distributing the various species of
insects into a quantity of small boxes


amazing stories

these were divided into four groups
one for each of the men and one for
the girl

  early the following morning hardy
gave final and explicit instructions to
each together with a box of insects and
a vial of the precious fluid concocted
by the professor it was agreed that
all would return to the room in the hotel
as soon as possible after the accomplish-
ment of their designated tasks

  the professor would accomplish his
part of the program in paris hardy
would go to berlin blake would make
his way as correspondent to the front-
line trenches arranged through hardys
influence doris as a y m c a hos-
tess was directed to the training camp
where the soldiers of the allied armies
halted preparatory to leaving for the
front the time set for execution of the
plan was ten oclock that night

ten oclock chimed in a tower in
paris professor milton kingsley
stared vacantly at the crowds of people
that scurried along the brightly-lighted
street that lay ten floors below slowly
   hesitantly he turned from the win-
dow to the table near by a group of
small boxes were arranged neatly on the
top mechanically with steady hand
he uncorked a bottle of clear liquid and
dipped a tiny nozzle into the fluid he
opened one of the boxes a mass of
ants struggled to escape from the
crowded quarters he pressed the bulbed
nozzle in his hand saturating the in-
sects then replaced the lid another
small box was opened spiders clawed
madly for freedom a stream from the
instrument and the insects quieted an-
other box of bees another of grass-
hoppers and finally a larger box of
caterpillars received the same treatment
professor kingsley opened the window
and again looked out at the street below
he hesitated only a moment and then

with a sudden determination threw the
boxes singly through the window   

  in berlin a large clock on the library
building indicated  oclock morton
hardy jumped into a taxicab and in-
structed the driver to travel slowly
through the city the saturated boxes of
insects were in a small case that he car-
ried as the cab traversed the business
section of the german city he threw
the tiny boxes upon the various streets
then he proceeded to the railroad sta-
tion where he boarded a train to a bor-
dering neutral country and thence re-
turned to paris

  the radium-lighted hands of a watch
on the wrist of albert blake glowed ten
oclock no mans land seemed un-
usually quiet as he walked in nervous
anticipation along the stretch of the first-
line trench even the soldiers whom
he always believed to occupy the line
so fully appeared peculiarly scarce he
asked about this and was informed that
this was one of the lulls that occur
usually just before the storm all
hell will break loose by morning his
informant prophesied little did he
guess how right he was blake thought
enfolded by the stygian blackness of the
trench and a starless sky he drew from
his pockets four small boxes a vial and
a rubber-bulbed syringe by the dim
light of a cigarette he filled the syringe
with the contents of the vial and then
carefully sprayed the contents of each
of the boxes with the fluid looking
around him lest some one suspect an
untoward act he hesitantly clutched the
boxes then swung them into the black-
ness of the battlefield a motorcycle dis-
patch messenger took him back of the
lines for a train to paris   

  in a y m c a hut ten miles be-
hind the lines doris kingsley heard taps
at ten oclock from her two pockets
she extracted small boxes in her stock-
ing was a vial of crystal-clear fluid a
peace weapons



sprayer was wrapped in a handkerchief
in the privacy of her room she hur-
riedly filled the sprayer with the liquid
and transferred its contents into insect-
filled boxes that she had laid before
her replacing the boxes in her pocket
she left the hut and walked several hun-
dred yards onwards and threw the tiny
boxes with all her force in all directions
she then prepared to leave the camp im-
mediately feigning illness she asked to
be taken back to paris

oorry mademoiselle there is no
 means of conveyance available at
the moment a french officer informed
her but surely in the morning   
doris didnt wait to hear further her
heart sank within her she rushed madly
to an american officer stationed in the
hut pleading for some means of trans-
portation to paris but he only smiled

    in the morning girlie you can
have a limousine   

 it was a night of terror for doris
kingsley she alone knew of the tens
of thousands of troops in camp the hor-
ror that the morning would bring the
hourly call of the guard that alls well
droned in her ears until sheer exhaus-
tion closed her eyes as she sank into a
near by chair in the recreation hall of

the building

  a grey bleak dawn announced the ad-
vent of day and with it came a stir of
activity a soldier on patrol duty rushed
into the room his eyes wide with ter-
ror seeing only the girl sleeping upon
a chair he shook her madly

  run for your life sister he cried
a freak circus has broken loose

  doris awoke instantly it was morn-
ing her first thought with the wild-
eyed soldier bending over her was of
her anticipated fear-the insects she
ran to a window and looked out the
sight that met her eyes brought an in-
voluntary recoil of horror a mammoth

grasshopper ten feet in length waved
its hairy antenna as if amazed by the
new world that appeared before its huge
multiple eyes in the distance several
gigantic ants were scurrying in char-
acteristic zig-zag course across the clear-
ing soldiers appeared from everywhere
stunned by nightmarish monstrosities
that infested the camp everywhere
were insects-giant horrible insects-
who calmly surveyed the amazed men
who were prepared to do battle against
them with puny rifles and pin-like bay-
onets mere bullets might well have
been feathers for all the effect such
means of combat could accomplish the
steel-coated pellets crashing against the
smooth rounded armor-like shell of the
insects richocheted as if contacting a
steel shell

  panic-stricken she fled from the hall
into a small adjoining room it took a
superhuman courage to face these crea-
tures and the girl sought the haven of
safety that she believed this antechamber
would afford her-at least until the in-
sects had begun to scatter

  she closed the door behind her and
held the knob as if exercising an added
precaution against possible entry by any
of the loathsome monsters suddenly a
sharp tap on an opposite window caused
her to wheel

  an involuntary scream rent the tiny
room she tore open the door and fled
back into the reception room it was
deserted outside she saw men fight-
ing the insects with guns and hand
grenades but the battle was a losing one
and the creatures steadily gained ground
against their puny assailants without
even a definite recognition of advance

  doris looked back into the little room
alone she faced the horrible sight a
gigantic head that pressed against the
window glass while huge horny mandi-
bles tapped the pane its grotesque
faceted eyes peered unemotionally into


amazing stories

the room apparently unaware of the
glass obstruction the creature decided to
enter the interior of the building and
by a slight additional pressure of its
body the glass gave way

t

the girl was stunned with fear
slowly the shiny brown body of a
monstrous insect forced its anterior sec-
tion through the opening doris recog-
nized it immediately as a huge beetle she
turned to escape but to leave the build-
ing now might be even more hazardous
than to take her chances with the whims
of this huge bug that now attempted an
entry

  a calm realization suddenly replaced
the mad fear that had possessed her bet-
ter by far to attack the insect while
handicapped in forcing its way through
the narrow opening of the window than
to wait for it to complete its entry and
then attempt a hopeless defense against
the overwhelming power of the creature

  resolutely she picked up a chair and
hesitantly approached the repulsive head
and hairy fore-legs of the beast with
mustered courage and every ounce of
strength that she possessed she crashed
the chair against the armored head of
the bug it scarcely felt the blow-or
except for a sharp click of its vicious
mandibles gave little notice of it but
it halted its attempted ingress

  she watched its movements for a mo-
ment it seemed as if it were stuck in
the window-straddled across the sill
tts movements had become more force-
ful and more convulsive the sides of the
building seemed to shake with its power-
ful efforts to free itself the girl took ad-
vantage of the situation and rained blows
upon it but to no avail it seemed far
more concerned in attempts to extricate
itself than in the girls pigmy efforts
to kill it

  the door to the building suddenly
burst open doris paled as she waited

for the brief second that seemed an in-
terminable age she stood rooted as she
waited the anticipated entrance of some
other mammoth monster a soldier
dashed in breathlessly

   quick into the cycle he cried ill
get you out of here it was just dis-
covered by other y workers that you
were left behind

  the girl swooned with the sudden re-
lease of tension

  hey this is a heluva time to faint
said the soldier picking her up   

  the futility of attempting battle with
insects because of their almost limitless
numbers soon became apparent to the
commanding officers accordingly a fire
had been built around the clearing and
all were ordered within its circle there
for the time being the camp awaited
the gradual disappearance of the mon-
sters   

it was an unusually quiet dawn on
the front lines through the slowly
lifting mist of night a lookout peered
cautiously across the top of the trench
he gasped suddenly and sat bolt up-
right as if an electric current surged
through him all unmindful of danger
from an enemy sniper with a cry he
tumbled back into the trench for he
had looked directly into the hairy awe-
some face of a giant ant

  in the distant enemy trench could be
heard an alarm signal ringing ap-
parently the enemy a bit more alert had
already spied the myriads of huge grue-
some insects that infested no mans
land and were now crawling aimlessly
in all directions above came the drone
of flying creatures bees wasps and
flies

  the alarm was now ringing wildly
in the french and english trenches
thousands of men poured from their
dug-out sleeping quarters ready for the
anticipated early morning enemy raid
peace weapons



but no enemy raid would ever have
struck such fear and astonishment into
their opponents as did this sight al-
ready soldiers from the opposing trenches
had climbed over and engaged the ter-
rifying things in battle but even armed
soldiers were no match against the on-
slaught of the insects the french and
english soldiers leaped into the unprece-
dented fray and with bullets gas and
liquid fire the two opposing armies
united against the common foe

  fear seemed to have been removed
entirely from the creatures for nothing
affected them the comparatively few
that succumbed to the fire and the gas
were replaced by hundreds more to fill
their places the insects were headed
for both trenches grasshoppers leaped
hundreds of feet into the barbed-wire
severing it like thread with the uncanny
strength of their powerful legs and
mandibles ants running with the speed
of race-horses sped through the line of
men bowling them over like tin soldiers
slashing with their scythe-like mouth
pieces repulsive spiders pounced upon
the helpless wounded and bound them
immovably in a silken web

  tanks were called into action but
even these modern implements of war-
fare seemed useless a battle between a
tank and a mammoth beetle was only a
battle between mans tank and natures
and the powerful charges of the gigantic
insect would bowl over the man-made
contrivances rendering the machine
helpless

  the lethal gases only halted the ac-
tivity of the monsters temporarily for
with the return of clearer air their at-
tacks and demeanor became as ferocious
as ever only hand-grenades seemed
to affect them but even under this as-
sault the wounds inflicted upon the giants
were seldom fatal ones the plan to
utilize liquid fire brought results as far
as killing any insects that came in con-

  tact with the flaming hydrocarbon but
this form of attack caused the bugs to
only flee before the fiery onslaught re-
tiring to a safer distance until this
danger had passed

  thus the new battle continued for
days and nights enemy soldiers forgot
hatreds for each other in the hatred for
this common menace as they fought
side by side along the entire front the
insects had spread for miles veritable
thousands of the gigantic creatures there
were and with their appearance before
a new battle line soldiers rose from
both trenches and took up arms in a
combined effort to stem the advance
of this horrible army

  at near by airdomes on both skies
of the lines aviators had not yet learned
of the menace that descended in the
night a patrol had taken off early
in the morning headed for enemy ter-
ritory five planes in battle formation
selected a three-thousand-foot altitude
for observatory purposes

t n the far distance a group of planes
a appeared headed toward the squad-
ron the leading plane piloted by the
commander signaled to his accompany-
ing ships to prepare for action the
speed of the approaching fleet seemed
incredible they traveled fully 
miles per hour the commander judged
he eyed them still in the distance in-
quisitively possibly the enemy had de-
veloped a new type of plane possibly
   but wait these were not planes

   these were    were   

  there was no longer time to consider
what the new-comers might be-it sud-
denly became too apparent-wasps-
huge grotesque mammoth wasps the
planes were as much of a surprise to
the insects apparently as were the in-
sects to the pilots for two had flown
directly into the blades of the whirling
propellers killing the insects instantly


amazing stories

and crippling two planes now useless

  horror seized the pilots and observers
in the ships as they recognized the mon-
ster creatures as if by a pre-deter-
mined signal the wasps surrounded the
two planes that had become disabled by
their contact with the other two insects
powerless the ships began gliding to
earth undaunted by the ill-success of
its fellow-creatures other wasps leaped
upon the planes terror-stricken the
pilots and observers abandoned the ships
and dropped like a plummet for fully a
thousand feet before pulling the rip-
cord of their parachutes hoping thus to
escape the flying horror but as fast as
gravity pulled so fast did the wasps
follow the downward course of the four
men with the opening of the chutes
and the flight arrested the helpless men
looked agonizingly at the circling in-
sects bullets from the pistols they car-
ried in a belt holster at their waist
were of little consequence suddenly
with a startling alacrity one of the
wasps pounced upon a pilot a struggle
ensued but the paralyzing stinger of the
insect found its mark slowly the para-
chute brought its unconscious burden to
earth

  and in the sky the battle continued
three planes with machine guns against
overwhelming odds

  then in the distance another fleet
appeared they were recognized as
enemy planes they were speeding into
the fray immediately the situation was
sized up by the new arrivals for they
had already been apprised of the ex-
istence of the creatures a hand-to-
hand combat ensued plane against
wasp it was a terrific battle and
never was an enemy so defiant to the
last insect they fought a few planes
had crashed with paralyzed pilots or
because a few had bailed out prefer-
ring a long drop to earth before pulling
the parachute trip cord rather than

to face battle with such awful creatures

  the battle over the remaining planes
formed again into their squadron a
friendly wing-tip salute came from the
enemy planes and each returned to their
own lines

but it was in paris and in berlin
that the major havoc was being
wrought by the insects already huge
spiders had spun gigantic webs between
buildings and across streets men had
been caught in the snares and drawn into
the greedy monsters larders ants
crowded into subways looking upon the
subterranean railroads as ready-made
burrows tearing slashing and killing
as they went transportation was at a
standstill tanks from the battlefronts
warred upon the creatures who tore
down wires wrecked buildings and held
the populace in a state of abject terror
huge grasshoppers flitted across the
cities halting only to strip trees of foli-
age or uproot choice shrubbery giant
bees seized upon a convenient building
and utilized the multi-storied edifice as a
hive sealing it with wax and honey
food-warehouses were overrun with
creatures who couldnt find enough to
eat to fill their monstrous carcasses
colossal caterpillers drew their tremen-
dous bulks into hotel lobbies and gazed
stupidly at the terror-stricken people
who had sought refuge inside enor-
mous repulsive flies carrion eaters of
the insect world proceeded to feast
upon vanquished men and dead insects
alike

slowly the creatures spread into
the smaller cities and towns and
villages of france and germany some
of the winged creatures had already
made their way across the channel into
england other insects descended into
austria and even into italy

  the terror continued for more than
peace weapons



a month thousands of people had
been killed or had died as a result of
insect attacks or of starvation when food
supplies had been entirely cut off all
europe was demoralized by the on-
slaught fighting between men had
ceased all implements of war was con-
centrated upon this new foe-the com-
mon enemy

  slowly normalcy returned nature
alone knew how to deal with these crea-
tures scarcely two months had elapsed
since the advent of the insects and now
not a single one lived those that had
not been annihilated by man died natur-
ally at the expiration of their normally
allotted span of life

  doris kingsley had made her way to
the hotel after several days and she
with the three men remained in paris
as spectators of the horror they had
liberated the crushing aggression of
the insects was far beyond the expecta-
tions of either the professor or of
hardy and for a time they feared
that they had truly loosed upon the
world a terror that could easily exceed
the ability of man to handle

  hardy spoke quietly and earnestly to
professor kingsley in the privacy of
their rooms late one afternoon the
menace had passed from the immedi-
ate city and the statesmans thoughts
turned to his next move word had
come through the newspapers that sol-
diers on the front-line trenches had
ceased their battling and were even fra-
ternizing following their fighting side
by side against the new enemy now
came the time to utilize the insects for
an everlasting good

  you have seen hardy declared
the initial activity of a super-police
department 

a meeting of the league of na-
tions was called for the follow-
ing week with the request that all na-

tions members of the court or other-
wise have representative delegates in
attendance with few exceptions all
were present at the opening

  hardy appeared as a citizen of the
united states-not as the official rep-
resentative by previous arrangement
with the ruling board of the league
hardy was permitted to address the
delegates assembled in the hall at
geneva

  first came a confession that he was
the sole cause of the invasion of giant
insects the delegates gasped in amaze-
ment and a hushed whisper swept the
room then all became quiet as hardy
continued to speak

  and here in this envelope he con-
tinued solemnly as he held aloft a sealed
packet is the secret for the creation
of the monstrous insects that over-ran
your home-lands i present it to the
league of nations as its sole weapon
of enforcement-the police department
of the league of nations the horror
that held nations in terror shall become
the club of this assembly to enforce
its demands and to assure the execu-
tion of its rulings to uphold the rights
of the weak and amicably settle the dis-
putes of the strong this weapon is
given into your hands in the name of
everlasting peace

  and further he said in conclusion
i want to impress upon all nations that
defiance of the league or the inaugura-
tion of warfare shall again bring these
hideous mammoth insects to the ag-
gressors land-originating as tiny
crawling things but becoming formidable
beasts overnight throw down your
guns destroy your battleships close
up your munition plants the common
enemy shall build a new brotherhood
of man

  a strange eerie silence held the room
as hardy slowly returned to his seat
there was no applause no cheers no

ovation quietly the delegates arose
and stood standing in tribute to a cour-
ageous man who had accomplished a
courageous deed

  and the world also learned of the
part that professor kingsley played in
the procedure as well as what blake
and doris had done the latter two
were married upon their return to the

united states but such is the tribute
of a nations regard for its idols that
they were forced to live in a secluded
section of an eastern seacoast town to
escape the annoying glaring spotlight
of public adoration so that there they
might resume the course of their lives
as normal american citizens   

  they had saved humanity

hastings-

by l b rosborough

we know that we are seeing stars to-day by light which left them centuries
ago we know that if people on those stars could see what was going on
upon the earth they would see nothing of the present but only the things of
the remote past light traveling at  miles a second with all space to
gambol in may play strange tricks if things could go as this story tells us

they did

illustrated by morey

       yron-henry carterets
eyes glowed with a fanatical
light and his white goatee
m m quivered with excitement as
he stepped toward his young
visitor emphasizing his words with a
shaking forefinger-within a few hours
we shall see my knightly forbear per-
form the feat of valor which raised him
to a position of wealth and power in the
councils of william the conqueror we
shall see him single-handed beat off a
horde of saxons who have fought their
way through the normans bodyguard
and save the life of the duke of nor-
mandy

  turning to the full-length portrait of
a burly knight in full armor looking
out truculently from beneath the raised
visor of his helmet he apostrophized the
spirit of his dead-and-gone kinsman
lammot de carteret after the lapse
of more than eight centuries we shall
see your trenchant axe flashing in the
sunlight and dripping blood rising and
falling with such fury that your attack-
ers shall break and flee in terror

  a look of incredulity verging on con-
sternation overspread the young mans
face

  but mr carteret what-

  carteret raised a placating hand and
smiled thinly

  no my boy i am not yet ready for
the padded cell although-his words
dripped venom-my esteemed fellow
citizens may think so riff-raff those
who do not plume themselves on their
crude democracy boast of their may-
flower ancestry fancy ones priding
himself on his descent from a crew of
imcompetent vagabonds who left their
native heath hopeless and beaten to
live like starving peasants in a strange
and savage land

  byron march fidgeted uneasily as he
listened to this harangue

  im afraid i didnt understand you
at first you have produced a motion

picture of-

  no not that i dont wonder at
your amazement but have patience this
machine-crossing the room and plac-
ing his hand upon a large cabinet of
curious design-will dissipate your
doubts

  byron covered his uneasiness with a
polite remark

  that will be great-to see a fighter
like sir lammot in battle he an-
swered lamely but-

  a  doughty warrior indeed the

amazing stories

 the spectators glanced uneasily at carteret who however smiled confi-
 dently and replied have patience my dear whitman the battle has

 only begun 
hastings-



norman sword was too light a play-
thing for him see in the picture he
carries a heavy axe this-taking
the implement from its place on the
wall-this is the identical weapon which
he used in that great encounter lift it
byron complied it certainly re-
quired a husky man to handle that

  a man of iron carteret responded
a man of vision as well plate armor
instead of chain mail-a visored hel-
met-such things did not come into
general use until later he was ahead
of his time

marchs gaze reverted doubtfully
to the cabinet

  but how do you expect to see events
that happened centuries ago  i have

heard of time machines-

  nothing so fantastic as that our
hopes are based on sound scientific prin-
ciples i presume you have some knowl-
edge of radio the speed of light and
such matters

  rather sketchy im afraid-depre-
catingly

  radio principles are not involved-i
use that only as an illustration the im-
pulses sent out-

  carteret paused and looked up as the
butler announced mr bruce whitman

  show him in the butler bowed and
withdrew carteret grimaced

  one of my democratic and somewhat
impecunious neighbors

  whitman entered-a quietly dressed
man of medium build whose face be-
spoke intelligence and considerable
strength of character-normally calm
but capable of stubborn persistence in
the face of opposition carteret pre-
sented march adding

the son of my cousin and dear
friend now deceased he will make his
home here and enter my business
whitmans face relaxed into a smile
as he took marchs hand and looked

into the youths clear gray eyes

a credit to your establishment and to
your business i am sure mr carteret

  the shadow of a frown flickered
across the older mans features at this
apparently innocent statement

  i quite agree with you-curtly   
to what do i owe the honor of your
visit

  perhaps it would be better to discuss
the matter privately

  as you like carteret led the way
to the library   

  byron march had expected no such
outburst when he inquired casually
about the portrait and received carterets
explanation that the subject of the
painting had fought at the battle of
hastings on that memorable th of
october  when the duke of nor-
mandy scattered the forces of king
harold and established himself as ruler
of england

  now he scanned his surroundings
curiously-a suit of armor in one cor-
ner ancient weapons incunabula and old
wood-cuts done in the awkward style of
the medieval artist-battle scenes remi-
niscent of those depicted in the bayeux
tapestry evidently cousin henrys in-
terest in the lore of the middle ages
amounted to an obsession that had
reached the proportions of a mania

  the conversation of the two in the
library floated back to him at first as a
murmur without significance then
whitmans voice rose as he emphasized
a point of the argument

       deliberately depressed values   
filched my ideas   the rest was indis-
tinguishable

presently through the doorway
he saw them come into the hall
whitman grim and angry carteret cyni-
cally polite the latter opened the door
bowed his visitor out and returned to
where byron waited


amazing stories

  whitman allows his imagination
to run away with his judgment
he observed he has been experiment-
ing along the same lines but lack of
funds has held up his work he
charges me with buying up a company
in which he was interested and wilfully
depressing the stock to impoverish him
and hamper his experiments-even go-
ing so far as to say that i got my ideas
from him absurd of course proba-
bly he in some way obtained access to
my plans and tried to develop them
himself

  no discretion-no background-a
man of common ancestry  not even
a mayflower in his family tree he
added sarcastically

  march glanced up at the wall carter-
ets expression resumed its air of ani-
mation

  you have been examining the old
wood-cuts that lot pictures the town
of hastings at the time of the con-
quest-the surrounding country-battle
scenes hastings is my hobby

  you had started to explain the
theory of your magic machine

  yes we started with the radio an-
alogy the impulses sent out from a
broadcasting station are called hertzian
waves after their discoverer some of
them traveling outward encounter a re-
flecting stratum-the heavyside layer-
and rebound to earth beginning at this
point i reasoned that light having the
same velocity as the radio waves might
be similarly affected-if not by the
heavyside layer then by a similar me-
dium far out in space

  it has been no easy task mr mead-
ows-an engineer in my employ-and i
have slaved night and day and now
this impudent rascal whitman claims
we stole his invention

  crust byron commented tersely
carteret chuckled

  but we proved our point we found

the light-reflecting layer surrounding
our universe at a distance of  light
years-a small matter of two quadrillion
five hundred forty-five trillion miles-
a million millions multiplied by 
plus a few odd billions

  byron gave a low whistle then
light years i have almost forgotten
the little astronomy i learned

  carteret explained a light year is
the distance traveled by light in one
year light continues indefinitely you
know many of the stars which we see
are hundreds or thousands of light
years away in short their light reach-
ing us now started on its journey
years ago

  but how do you apply that prin-
ciple here march asked how do you
expect to see something that happened
on the earth hundreds of years ago

carterets eyes beamed with sat-
isfaction at his pupils apparent in-
terest

  as you know we see ordinary ob-
jects by the light which is reflected from
them to our eyes light reflected from
the earthly scene  years ago sped out-
ward to the reflecting stratum-shall
we call it the carteret layer-was re-
flected back from that vast globular
mirror and comes to earth again-
years each way do you see

  i get the theory but it seems be-
yond belief

  the old man chuckled well my
young doubting thomas ill not hold
that against you but by to-morrow
night you shall be convinced meadows
has some few adjustments to make and
the device should be in perfect working
order to pick up these feeble reflected
rays and put before us a view of the
world in 

  when march retired to his room for
the night he was careful to see that the
door was securely fastened feeling that
hastings-



a substantial lock was more to be
trusted than the vagaries of a mind
which wandered among the scenes of a
dim and misty past on the border-
land of sleep the thought of whitman
intruded itself into his mind    hard
to think of him as the undependable
character which carteret had painted
   cultivate whitmans acquaintance
   feel his way about    carefully
though -   carefully    until he got
his bearings   

  bruce whitman fuming inwardly
returned home his home now-but for
how long-with his modest means de-
pleted through the machinations of
henry carteret and a lien on the prem-
ises in the hands of the bank whose
policies must be shaped with an eye to
the approval of the local leader of in-
dustry damn carteret and all his
works-his cheap pretensions to aris-
tocracy-his endless scheming for more
power and notoriety not satisfied to
be monarch of all he surveyed the old
pirate must reach out his meddlesome
hands and rob him of the fruit of years
of work-with meadows help

  meadows now    not a bad fellow
at heart-just another pawn in carterets
game he would see meadows at the
first opportunity   

a nights sleep soothed his ruffled
feelings and without a very def-
inite idea as to what he expected to ac-
complish but feeling that nn stone
should be left unturned which might re-
veal useful information he made an
early morning call on carterets as-
sistant

  bill how long are you going to be
a partner in henry carterets crimes
a bantering tone took the edge off his
words

  easy youre talking treason against
 the king maybe i dont approve of
 everything he does but i do have an

aversion to seeing my family in the
bread line meadows face sobered
but i am almost at the end of my
tether the old devil has driven me
frantic in the last few weeks-gone com-
pletely loco on the light machine-ir-
ritable-unreasonable ive been tempted
more than once to smash the apparatus
if he doesnt calm himself that bum
heart of his will stop suddenly some
day

  which wouldnt be a cause for gen-
eral mourning whitman cut in lean-
ing forward he added earnestly bill
i know he stole the idea from me isnt
that true

  meadows looked uncomfortable
what you know you know you un-
derstand my position while i am in

his employ- he ended with a shrug

i will say however that no papers
have been filed with the patent office
-not even a caveat he felt that
secrecy would be better protection dur-
ing the development stage than an ap-
plication for patent

  i thought the same whitman re-
plied the publicity of a patent
without ample financial backing merely
invites infringement but someone dis-
covered my secret

  the thing is about complete now
meadows continued i hope his demon-
stration to-night will be satisfactory
if it isnt there wont be any getting
along with him

  to-night

  yes we have definitely located the
reflective stratum and got some glimpses
of the earth-southern england-hast-
ings he says about the time of the nor-
man conquest if i can get the reflec-
tor plate to operating reliably hell put
on a show hopes to give the admiring
citizens a look at his dear old ancestor
in action

  perhaps i could help out on the re-
flector if necessary whitman suggested


amazing stories

i dont suppose i could hope for an
invitation though

 i think you can it will be his
chance to do a little gloating youre a
history shark-it ought to be interest-
ing to you

  it would whitman smiled thought-
fully hastings eh yes i know a
little history-perhaps even more about
that hastings affair than sir henry him-
self id be glad to give him a chance
to gloat

 whitman went home to brush up on
his historical knowledge by the reading
of some old documents recently received
while meadows drove to the carteret
home and immersed himself in the work
of making final preparations for the
coming exhibition by mid-afternoon
march found his opportunity to inter-
view whitman carteret who had been
busily engaged with meadows came to
him and said

 byron things are coming along
splendidly we shall make this a gala
affair-have some of the executives
from the plant come over-several of
the business men from town-dr
sharp of course-and i want whitman
here he smiled maliciously i par-
ticularly want whitman he seemed to
like you go over and see him-smooth
him down-try to get him to come i
believe his curiosity will get the better
of his bad temper

  byron found his task unexpectedly
easy whitmans promise secured he
broached the subject uppermost in his
mind

  mr whitman i dont like it hell
make a holy show of himself airing his
wild ideas in public is he    well is
he entirely sane he finally blurted

sane enough in that respect at any
rate i dont know just how far he
has succeeded but the idea is sound
march left still in doubt whitman
appeared rational enough but the thing

was out of all reason-simply couldnt
be done

  whitman turned again to the docu-
ments on his desk and after a little
further study folded them up with a
smile of satisfaction and placed them in
a drawer

when he appeared at the carteret
mansion that evening the little
company had already assembled car-
teret greeted him blandly and showed
him to a chair meadows his worried
face a picture of suppressed irritation
tinkered with the projector the buzz
of conversation ceased as carteret rose
to address his guests

  we hope to give you the privilege
within a very short time of looking
back through the pages of history al-
most a thousand years-not at a motion
picture with mere puppet players but at
the actual deeds of flesh-and-blood
characters seen through the vast celes-
tial mirror which surrounds our uni-
verse

  explaining briefly the theory as
given to march he continued 

  the heart of this machine consists
of two parts-one of which we call the
filter-reflector plate and the other the
intensifier plate each is made up of
two sheets of quartz glass set closely
together in a frame enclosing a com-
bination of gases through which a cur-
rent of electricity can be passed you
are all familiar with the neon electric
sign in which the passage of the current
causes the gas in the slender tubes to
glow with colored light in our filter-
reflector plate it gives the gas the property
of reflecting certain rays of light with
the proper voltage the plate will reflect
only the very weak rays coming back
to us from space as i have explained
and permit the strong visible beams
to pass through

  these weak rays are thrown upon
hastings-



the other plate which intensifies them
to a point of visibility

  sets of delicate lenses at the re-
ceiving and projecting ends and focus-
ing controls for increasing the field of
vision or decreasing it to give a sharp
close-up view complete the apparatus
meadows made his final adjustment
and at a word from his employer threw
in the switch a whisper of excited
comment ran through the assemblage
at the sight which met their gaze
spread before them lay a circular sec-
tion of countryside bathed in sunlight
cutting into the picture on one side ap-
peared an orderly arrangement of lines
and squares recognizable as the out-
skirts of a town meadows turned the
concentrating knob and the scene nar-
rowed while the details enlarged and
stood out sharply

  hastings carteret gloated medie-
val hastings

  meadows moved the circle of visibility
across the country and again sharpened
the focus carterets voice chattered on

tvhat is senlac hill-and as the
a scene came nearer and grew more
distinct-an army encampment-see it
the english army of king harold
the circle shifted to the left of the
armys position there-the king and
his bodyguard-the hus-carls-the ban-
ner of the golden dragon of wessex
and the kings own standard

  the circle moved slowly about re-
vealing the guards in their chain mail
armed with the long saxon battle axes
the horde of rustics carrying clubs
scythes and every manner of rude
weapon hastily gathered together by
harold in his dash southward from
stamford bridge to meet the norman
invaders and far to the right the
abrupt falling away of the hill to the
marshes which protected the armys
flank

  alternately reducing and increasing
the field of vision meadows swept it
across the country to the mound of tel-
ham where the army of the duke of
normandy-soon to become william the
conqueror-had taken up its stand the
bretons on the left wing mercenary
troops on the right and william with
his knights and archers grouped around
the papal standard in the center-the
knights in chain armor and conical hel-
mets with nose-pieces similar in appear-
ance to the accouterments of the hus-
carls of harold but carrying lances and
swords instead of axes

  in the group immediately surround-
ing william was one exception-a knight
of great stature encased in plate armor
wearing a helmet with visor adjustable
at will and armed with an axe carteret
gripped the arm of whitman look
lammot de carteret he shook
whitmans arm do you recognize
him

  undoubtedly your noble relative

  the scene flickered and faded car-
teret exclaimed impatiently and mead-
ows fumbled with the controls in an
effort to clarify the image

  whitman laughed maliciously car-
teret threw him an angry glance

  whats wrong meadows he asked
  unstable gas mixture in the filter-

reflector plate i told you-

  rectify it clear up the scene
when the picture reappeared the
norman camp was bustling with plans
for the attack carteret took meadows
place at the projector and again ad-
dressed the audience

  gentlemen you are about to look
upon a scene which no mortal eye has
beheld in more than eight centuries-
the battle of hastings or senlac which
occurred  years ago in this en-
gagement my ancestor lammot de
carteret distinguished himself and
gained the special favor of the duke of 


amazing stories

normandy he crouched behind the
machine his glowing eyes fixed on the
screen

  a lone horseman rode out from the
norman ranks tossing his sword into
the air and catching it dexterously as
it fell followed by the foot soldiers from
both flanks of the army

  carterets eager voice broke the si-
lence in the room the man on horse-
back is taillefer the minstrel singing
the battle song of charlemagne and ro-
land

  your illustrious ancestor is to be
congratulated on his judgment mr car-
teret whitman said blandly he tem-
pers valor with discretion

  the spectators glanced uneasily at
carteret who however smiled confi-
dently and replied have patience my
dear whitman the battle has only
begun

the charging host swept across the
intervening space and came to grips
with the english taillefer was the
first to fall toppled from his horse by
the sweep of a long-handled axe the
foot-soldiers closed in on the chain-
shirted warriors surrounding king har-
old axe met sword in a wild orgy of
battle the left wing swarmed across
the trench and against the stockade
which sheltered the rest of the english
army only to be brained by the clubs
of the rustics or cut down by their
scythes the rear ranks pressed for-
ward climbing over the bodies of their
slain comrades but the stubborn re-
sistance was too much for the attackers
who at last fell back leaving a windrow
of dead before the english line

  with the return of the foot-soldiers
the norman knights spurred their steeds
forward in a thunderous charge lances
splintered against the long shields of the
hus-carls planted firmly side by side to
form a wall as impregnable as the bar-

ricade which protected the peasant sol-
diers-an obstacle which they could not
pass thrusting with lance and hewing
with sword they beat against the bar-
rier like waves against a cliff axe
spear scythe and sickle struck back at
them shearing down horse and rider
until they too were forced to with-
draw

  from time to time carteret shifted
the view back to the mound of telham
where william sat on his horse scan-
ning the field of battle surrounded by
a small group of knights among them
lammot de carteret finally whitman
cleared his throat and commented
suavely

  sir lammot appears to have defi-
nitely aligned himself with the home
guards

  quite naturally he belonged to that
select group chosen by the duke as
his bodyguard henrys unctuous re-
tort brought a dutiful laugh from his
retainers

  so i see an excellent job-and a
safe one apparently

  wave after wave surged across the
shallow valley and up the slope of sen-
lac hill to crash against the english
front and roll back in confusion the
shadows on the battlefield shortened
and began to point eastward

  the hours passed unnoticed by the
watchers in the laboratory who sat
enthralled by the spectacle silent except
for an occasional sharp ejaculation at
some particularly thrilling episode-hear-
ing in fancy the trampling of the horses
the clash of arms the shouts of the
combatants and the groans of the
dying on the english right the bre-
ton troops composing the left wing of
williams forces became entangled in
the marshes the entire army appeared
to waver

  carteret brought the full amplifying
power of the instrument to bear on the
hastings-



spot where william had rallied his
knights around him

  whitman he called out have you
noticed the very active part that sir
lammot has been taking do you see
him now in the very thick of the fray

  whitman laughed he has been do-
ing rather well perhaps some of that
good norman wine has steadied his
nerves

the duke closed the visor of his
helmet lifted his heavy mace and
led his followers in a whirling charge
directly at the position occupied by har-
old and his guards the galloping
horsemen struck like a thunderbolt
williams charger went down and the
duke leaped clear almost at the feet of
king harold a huge saxon raised his
axe before it could fall the norman
brought his mace crashing on the skull
of his adversary

  gyrth is down-the brother of har-
old is killed carteret chattered

  duke william seized another mount
the attackers were borne back again
he was unhorsed then the little audi-
ence in the laboratory saw lammot de
carteret turn his steed and urge it fran-
tically back through the crowded ranks
behind him william held up a hand
but the rider spurred past and dashed
away two mounted knights blocked his
path and grasped the bridle of his
horse the duke strode back and faced
him panic-stricken de carteret struck
out viciously with his mailed fist and
the next moment was dragged down by
the enraged commander who vaulted
into the saddle and with a gesture to
the captors of de carteret turned his
attention to the conflict the pair seized
the rebellious knight a short fierce
struggle ensued and he was subdued
and led away

 whitmans laugh now was mocking-
malicious he turned to speak to car-

teret but checked himself in the dim
light the old mans face seemed hag-
gard his body shrunken his eyes so
full of fire a moment before dull and
listless but he stuck to his post turn-
ing the focusing control so that the scene
receded until the figure of his disgraced
ancestor was lost among the thronging
troops on the field of battle

  the normans began to retreat and
the half-armed rustics scenting victory
swarmed down from the crest and
spread over the slope in pursuit wil-
liam continued the strategem until his
foes had scattered over the plain and the
norman forces had been brought to-
gether quickly the invaders re-formed
and turned upon their pursuers the
fighting increased in violence with the
normans pressing the attack and the
english resisting every step of the way

  henry carteret swept the field with
the magic circle of visibility and scanned
the screen anxiously but the figure of
sir lammot was no more to be seen

  gradually the remnants of the band
of foot-soldiers were pushed back over
their broken stockade and the normans
following closely swept them from the
hilltop and scattered them like leaves
before the wind three oclock on the
field of hastings and the hill was won
but harold with his armored veterans
still held his position at the left

  a clock in another room of the man-
sion boomed the hour of midnight the
butler brought food and drink car-
teret silently took the glass offered him
and drained it

  better lie down and get a little rest
march urged

  carteret gestured impatiently no
no i must see the finish of this the
chance will never come again he
turned back to the controls

  whitman yawned i am anxiously
awaiting the return of sir lammot


amazing stories

carteret glanced around angrily
but made no reply members of
the gathering who had more than once
smarted under his caustic words or
resented in secret his intolerable as-
sumption of superiority discreetly sup-
pressed smiles of satisfaction

having rested his troops william
moved against the position where
harold and his surviving retainers waited
behind tbeir ring of shields six hours
of fighting had not broken the spirit
of the defenders and at each onslaught
their axes took a heavy toll of the at-
tacking horde wearying of his fruit-
less efforts the duke fell back his
archers came up within bow-shot and
released a cloud of arrows with no
means of retaliation the english
crouched behind their fence of shields
while the hail of feathered shafts beat
upon them gaps appeared in the wall
as arrows found their way through the
barrier and struck down the men behind
it

  the shadows lengthened and the
scene took on the rosy hue of evening-
the end of the day was at hand and
with it the end of the line of saxon
kings harold stood up raised his axe
shook it defiantly at the besiegers a
shaft pierced his eye and he went down
the shower of arrows stopped abruptly
the norman horsemen again plowed into
the broken ranks a swirling fury of
conflict raged for a few moments over
and around the body of the fallen
leader then the few survivors broke
and fled down the hill and into the
forest

  once more the screen went dark one
of the members of the group looked at
his watch three-fifteen i had no
idea it was so late he suggested
leaving but carteret objected

  no no well soon have it again

  whitman spoke to meadows and left
the room returning several minutes later
with a large square package which he
handled with extreme care carteret by
this time had worked himself into a
frenzy at meadows failure to get the
projector into operation meadows
stepped back from the apparatus

  im through he said quietly his
voice quivering with anger from now
on youll have to handle your stolen in-
vention without my help

  a dead silence settled over the room
the startled eyes of the audience were
fixed on the two carteret gasped and
attempted to speak pressed his hand to
his heart and sank into a chair whit-
man stepped forward and faced the
gathering

vou have heard what mr meadows
x has said it is true the invention
is mine with all his resources mr
carteret has not been able to bring it
to perfection i have here a filter plate
built in my own laboratory with my
limited means possibly we shall still
be in time to see an incident which will
be interesting to you-and-smiling
ironically in the direction of his host-
to mr carteret

  with the installation of the new plate
the screen came to life

  william of normandy had had a tent
erected and was sitting in front of it
before him stood lammot de carteret
his helmet gone hands bound behind
him a guard on either side william
gestured the guards seized the prison-
ers arms and dragged him away strug-
gling desperately to a tree standing
nearby a rope was placed around his
neck and the end thrown over a limb

  again whitmans sharp triumphant
laugh broke the stillness carteret ut-
tered a choked cry struggled to his
feet and tottered across the room to the
hastings-



portrait livid face contorted with pas-
sion he snatchcd an ancient sword from
the wall and slashed the painting re-
peatedly at once the room was in an
uproar the spectators sprang to their
feet overturning chairs in the general
confusion

  the canvas was reduced to shreds
henry carteret faced about and glared
around the room whitman with
meadows help was retrieving his own
property-removing the loaned reflector
plate from the machine

  whitman    meadows    plot-
ters- henrys voice rose high and

shrill ill-

  he started menacingly toward them
the by-standers closed in on him-
wrenched the sword from his hand
he pushed them aside seized a chair
and brought it down again and again
on the projector reducing it to a mass
of wreckage before the others could
recover from their astonishment he
crumpled to the floor

  dr sharp knelt at his side silence
again the physician looked up and
spoke briefly to whitman and mead-
ows who stood by whitman turned
and raised his hand

to join his illustrious ancestor

a science pacifist poem of 

   how far it ennobles a man to live in a trench of indescribable dirtiness his
   person in a condition of desperate insanitation-which condition can also be
   assigned to the indescribable class-is not open to classification war in
   ancient days was largely a hand-to-hand combat calling for the exercise of
   great personal courage the old-time warrior complaining of the shortness
   of his sword was told by his mother to add his arm to it the bow and
   arrow the sling and the javelin gave a limited increase to the range of action
   but modern war with a range of miles instead of yards where a hole in the
   ground takes the place of the old-time fort is far more horrible than the war
   of even a hundred years ago

  the little poem given here was written in the year  by a boy on his
  sixteenth birthday it was written as a college exercise his father would
  not let him hand it in he had to write another of the common garden
  variety on the same subject

love of country

                should love of country eer the poet inspire

                should it eer warm the heros breast to fire

                if men are equal and if brothers all

subjugating the earth

        by walter kateley	v

 we have had stories by this author in preceding issues of amazing stories
 and we are glad to see his work once more upon our pages the story
 which is quite ingeniously carried out is not wanting in the elements of
 excitement and tension and we are sure that it will be appreciated by our

                                   readers

                      illustrated by morey

m  he icc was much thicker than
usual and the chippings
thrown up as i chopped fell
m on the smooth snow and slid
back persistently into the hole

  we had cleared away the snow at
this fishing hole so often that it was
now piled into a high rim and formed
a deep crater

  laying aside my small trappers axe
i knelt to clear away the loose icc with
my mittened hands

  bitter experience-bitter cold experi-
ence-had taught me that the thing to
do was to make the hole full size from
the start being careful not to chip
through until there remained but a thin
layer that could easily be broken away
because after the water had surged up
as it always did when covered with
heavy ice it was exasperatingly diffi-
cult to do any more chopping

  in the arctic cold one avoids splashes
of water since they may easily mean
frozen spots on the face or frost-bite
from damp clothing

  with a double handful of chopped
ice i raised my head to look for a low
place in the rim over which to throw
it

  but i never threw it

through the mist of drifting snow and
in the gloom of white starlight i saw

a sight that arrested all normal action

  my first thought was that it was
some strange soft of insect with wings
next that it was some kind of man with
a flying machine

  the body and limbs seemed to be
wrapped in heavy clothing and the great
round head was thickly hooded but
out of the hood three bright eyes were
looking down at me very intently there
was an eye above and two below in a
triangular arrangement

  the body tall as a mans seemed to
be provided with half a dozen arms
or were some of them legs they were
so intermingled with the parts of the
flying apparatus that it was difficult in
the gloom to make out where limbs left
oflf and machinery began

  then below and almost resting on the
snow was a large bulbous looking mem-
ber that might i thought be either a
part of the creatures body or the body
of a mechanical flyer

  four wings stood out behind in shape
somewhat resembling those of a dragon-
fly devils darning needle but i
thought i detected a metallic sheen and
above the swish of the north wind i
heard or imagined i heard the hum
of a small motor

  the apparition was so weird so alto-
subjugating the earth



corn let out a gasp of astonishment and stood staring as i did in bewil-
dered surprise it was i realized another individual such as i had seen

at the fishing hole


amazing stories

gether unearthly that i doubted my own
eyes

  could this be some strange and un-
known arctic insect

  could it be a man an explorer with
strange goggles and a stranger flying
machine or even a creature from some
other world

  or-worse thought-was i just see-
ing things seeing things as men are
said to do when the nervous strain of
wild and waste places has unbalanced
their minds

  i closed my eyes fearing that i would
see it still but it was gone and all
dark i hoped it would still be gone
when i opened my eyes

  i had been afraid that my mental
health might suffer what with the close
confinement the limited diet and the
awful wastes of the surrounding vast-
ness and though neither of us ever
spoke of it i felt that my partner was
also beset by an ever-present dread

yet a few seconds reflection con-
vinced me that since i had suf-
fered no ill-health or fits of despon-
dency my mind must still be normal
mental derangement could not come
upon me suddenly like this

  although we had not supposed there
was anything more human within several
hundred miles of us than a polar bear
yet whatever this thing was it must be
real and must be faced

  as i opened my eyes and stood up
it was still looking down at me

  hello i shouted who comes

  there was no response

  the creature only shifted its position
a little to the left as though to get a
better view

  and now i saw that the three eye-
objects which i had thought might pos-
sibly be some sort of goggles were in-
deed real eyes for the great one which

was several times as large as my own
moved unmistakably

  i felt a little foolish and not know-
ing what else to do i picked up the little
axe and waited

  i had not long to wait

  presently long wings came into view
commenced to vibrate silently and the
creature lifted and flew away

  scrambling up the steep bank i peered
after him as he rose in the gloom to
become a silhouette against the cold sky
and fade quickly in the distance

  for a moment i stood motionless in
the deep snow undecided what to do

  should i call to my companion at the
shack should i go and tell him of the
strange apparition  i hesitated to do
either

  would it not strain his credulity
would he think i had really seen any-
thing or would he think i was only
slipping mentally would i have be-
lieved it if he had told of seeing such
a creature would it not be better to
say nothing of it since there was no
tangible evidence to back up my state-
ment but there was evidence tracks
in the snow

  they started in the loose snow a rod
from the fish hole two rows wide apart
and a smooth trail in the middle like a
sea turtles track up a sandy beach

  in an instant my mind was made
up i would hurry and get my partner
show him the tracks and explain all
afterward

 i knew he would be busy with
what we called the civilization act
washing up the one tin plate and the
two aluminum cups and tidying the
igiooshack euphemism for sod rock
and snow den this we always did re-
ligiously every day in the same spirit
that the englishman in far-away gov-
ernment posts and amid only primitive
natives always dresses for dinner

  as i turned i heard a crunching step
subjugating the earth



in the snow and saw com-his real
name was cornwallis-straddling along
in the foot-prints i had left

  evidently he had decided that he
needed some liquid water and had come
out with the larger cup thinking i
would have finished cutting the ice away

  while my bewildered brain was grop-
ing for words to start my tale he called
out what was your friend 

  oh did you see it too i was
very consciously relieved

  just caught a glimpse as i opened
the door saw something big fly up-
too dark to make out what was it

   dont know i replied come and
look at the tracks

  didnt you see it close up werent
you right here what are you looking
at the tracks for he asked all in one
breath

  it was something queer-unearthly
i told him ill tell you all about it-
i didnt know you had seen it and i just
wanted to make sure-

he was examining the tracks but he
straightened up and looked at me
quizzically

  oh oh i see he said you didnt
-you werent quite-quite sure   
was it so strange as that

  well im glad you saw it i said
lets get in out of the cold and ill
tell you about it

  inside i fastened the low door and
described as best i could what i had
seen when i had finished corn sat a
moment meditating

  well jeemses river he ejaculated
at length i wouldnt know what to
think about that

  unless-unless-it might be some
flying ant that some doctor or scientist
has let loose after performing operations
on the glands that produce giantism
oh no that couldnt be i said
flying ants only fly a few days in

the summer each year anyway what
would an ant be doing up here in the
arctic 

  this thing i am sure was wearing
wraps of some sort and i dont think
i could be mistaken about the flying
apparatus being mechanical

  well maybe youre right corn
admitted of course i didnt get much
of a look at it did it look fierce or
threatening 

  no i thought not only curious and

interested-

  what do you think it is

  well i answered with some hesi-
tation it didnt seem to me like any-
thing earthly i am almost inclined to
believe it was a visitor from some other
world or something

  corn gave a long-drawn-out whistle
most anything is possible he ad-
mitted  but if that thing is only visit-
ing the earth it must have rotten poor
judgment to stop in this place that god
forgot

  anyway i suppose if he is inter-
ested he will come back i reasoned

  yes agreed corn and maybe bring
some of his little playmates with him
its too bad we havent more room to
entertain he finished with a little whim-
sical snort do you suppose they might
happen to have any tea over to their
place

  wed better not go out without the
rifle i advised no he answered
soberly it can do no harm to be
careful

  after discussing the matter a while
longer he went back with me to the
fish hole and stood guard with the rifle
while i fished but it was too cold to
stay out long and we were obliged to
go home without any fish or any further
adventure

  back in our den after making my
daily entry in the note-book and ending
it with a great question mark i sat


amazing stories

long pondering over this strange event
it seemed even stranger than the ad-
venture that had brought us here and
the misadventure that had forced us to
stay

	   

  in the early spring corn and i had
set out to the far north to visit the
nesting grounds of the eider duck in the
interests of the international audubon
society

  first by rail then by airplane and
finally by boat wc had penetrated far
into the arctic far beyond even the
farthest northern mining outposts of the
great companies exploiting the newly
found riches of the wild frontier

t t was in fact at one of their outposts
accessible only by airplane or light
boat that we fell in with the hardy half-
breed prospector who was reputed to
know more of the wilds beyond the
arctic circle than even the arctic owls

  he had imported a little motor by air-
plane and built a small boat near the
northern limits of timber and come on
down the river stopping at little grass
camp to take on a supply of gasoline in
sealed tin containers

  he was bound in the direction we
wanted to go and when we offered to
pay a fare and grubstake him he boost-
ed his price as high as he thought the
traffic would bear and accepted

 he was going to a region he had
never visited but had seen once
with a long-range glass he couldnt
promise us that there would be any
eider ducks nesting there but he thought
it a very likely place at least if there
ever had been any there they had never
been disturbed or driven away for no
one not even an indian had ever been
there so far as he could find out it
ought to be virgin soil both for his
prospecting and our hunting

  he seemed an intelligent and capable
fellow and we lost no time in bun-
dling our meagre equipment on board his
boat together with a couple of bales of
provisions which we bought under his
direction

  day after day we floated or motored
down the low-banked sluggish streams
or hoisting a sail to save fuel tacked
in and out among the low-lying coastal
islands until at last after nearly a
month we turned up a smaller stream
that zak-whether that was his first or
his last name we never knew-declared
must lead to the region we had come
to explore

 we had found the fellow a very
agreeable traveling companion possessed
of a surprising knowledge of wild nature
and frontier lore

  his only really distressing failing was
the careless way in which he handled
his firearms and the stock of stick dyna-
mite he carried for use in his pros-
pecting

t t e seemed to have no conception of
 the ordinary and reasonable pre-
cautions that to us seemed quite essen-
tial we were not backward about tell-
ing him so but he failed to understand
all we said or else he did not care

  presently we came to where the land-
scape was a little more rugged and
where there were tufts of grass and a
great deal of reindeer moss and most
important of all from a naturalists
standpoint a number of wild ducks
flying

 here we made camp and set to
work corn and i with our traps and
gun and zak with his prospectors
outfit

  he made several overland trips into
the rougher country while we searched
with fair success for the nesting places
of the wily ducks securing spccimcns
subjugating the earth



of nests eggs young and mature ducks
and much data on their habits

  one day-at this time of year it was
daylight throughout the twenty-four
hours-we went down the little river
and along the coast a few miles in-
tending to return to the camp at night

  while we were engaged in attempt-
ing to net some half-grown ducks on
the shore in order to band them zak
prospected a rocky island not far out

  toward night we saw zak start back
toward shore

  the waves were choppy but the
wind was with him and we anticipated
no trouble

  then suddenly when he was half-way
over there was a heavy detonation and
looking up i saw a cloud of smoke
roll up from the boat and almost in-
stantly the boat sank out of sight

  its the dynamite shouted corn
from a few rods down the beach he
must have exploded it

  he came running up to where i was
standing and together we stood shading
our eyes and peering out over the water

  there was no trace of anything save
the waves

  im afraid hes done for i said
and my voice sounded hollow and far
away i wonder what happened

  maybe said corn also in a tragi-
cally husky voice he was getting a
charge ready to shoot fish

  or maybe his gun discharged acci-
dentally and set it off anyway we
are lucky we werent out with him

  i dont know about that i replied
pessimistically our situation is not
much better what are we going to
do

  i dont know admitted corn turn-
ing and looking dismayed at the dreary

   	thousands of wild birds have hrc hm x-i
 identification tags during the last decade or more in
 order to study tieir migration and otner habits

landscape but we shall carry on he
said stoutly

  we waited a day hoping for what the
waves might deliver but there was ab-
solutely no trace of either our guide
or his boat so we treked back to
camp

here we took account of stock and
of our predicament we had a
tiny tent some preserving chemicals for
specimens our guns and traps and a
small supply of provisions mostly raisins
and canned fruits and the nearest hu-
man being so far as we knew might be
five hundred miles away there was no
boat and nothing with which to make
one

  to make matters worse the very day
we got back to camp and before we
had recovered from the exhausting trip
corn met with an accident

  we saw some wild geese alight not
far away and corn hurried out with
the rifle-we had but one rifle and a
small-gauge shotgun he managed to
wing one and in chasing the wounded
bird over rough ground he sprained his
ankle so badly that he could barely
hobble back to camp

  in spite of our best efforts in caring
for the injury the leg became badly
swollen and inflamed and it soon be-
came evident that a tendon must have
been dislocated or torn loose and that
corn was in for a long siege of inac-
tivity

  we had planned to take what we
could carry on our backs and start
south overland winter would be upon
us presently-there had been already a
flurry of snow the birds would all be
gone south and there would be nothing
to live on while crossing the hundreds
of miles of wilderness that lay between
the low coast and the timber line now
it seemed our only chance was to spend
the winter here and in the spring when

corn should be well to make an early
start

  it was a dreary prospect but i set
to work to make what preparations were
possible

  i was able to get a few ducks and
geese it was now cold enough so there
was little danger of their spoiling and
after gathering a small supply of the
meager growth of peat and moss for
fuel i turned my attention to building
a shack of stones and sods

  a trip to the seashore and an all-day
search there yielded but a few pieces
of driftwood and a piece of heavy board
evidently from the superstructure of
some wrecked boat it was only four
feet long but it had to serve for a
door

  the ground was frozen before i could
get the walls up and the snow was
soon a foot and more deep so i was
obliged to resort to blocks of snow to
finish the walls and roof

  meanwhile corn was slowly recover-
ing and presently he was able to lend a
hand

  ry this time the noon sun barely
appeared above the horizon and almost
immediately the long winter night set in

  from then on our only outdoor activ-
ity was fishing through the ice of the
small stream and often the weather was
too cold and stormy for days at a time
for us to do even that much for-
tunately as an emergency measure we
had brought heavy coats mittens and
very heavy woolen socks

  but sixty or seventy below zero tem-
perature and a snow-laden wind are not
to be braved with impunity

  the heavy blanket of snow was all i
presume that saved the ten feet of river
water from freezing solid and killing
all the fish

  ours was a dreary life

  the only redeeming feature about it
was my companions ever refreshing

personality his was a versatile mind
and an absolutely unquenchable soul

  with some little touch of humor he
could always banish stern reality

often during the physical and
mental rigors of that seemingly in-
terminable period i thanked my lucky
stars that i had not had the misfor-
tune to be marooned with an ordinary
soul

  even our almost continuous diet of
fish was to him but a joke

  we schooled ourselves to eat them
frozen partly because we believed them
to be more healthful uncooked but more
because there was so little fuel with
which to cook them

  in fact everything in the igloo-shack
save only ourselves was frozen most of
the time

  but we never learned to eat them as
do the eskimos attacking a whole fish
tearing off the edible parts with the
teeth and discarding the head bones-
and the rest-at the end of the meal
instead we split them and cut off the
head first and attempted only half at a
time

  i recall one particular morning-or
was it evening-we were no longer sure
which twelve oclock marked midnight
and which noon and for the time being
it was no matter for the sun would not
rise for more than a month yet and
only the stars relieved the blackness of
night

  we were eating our usual breakfast
by the dim light of the oil dip com
picked up his frozen fish but hesitated
before eating it i mistrusted that he
was trying to summon courage since
needless to say we had long before
ceased to care for fish but if such
was the case his spartan soul rose
superior to the occasion starting to
eat he remarked blandly that was
quite a thunder-shower we had in the
subjugating the earth



night i imagine the links will be a
little wet this afternoon

  i do hope that grace had the sense
to take a taxi he went on after a mo-
ment

  i laughed a little bitterly i fear and
went on with my meal

  after a moment he said

  now alfred-laying down his fish
and pointing a finger severely at me-
i dont want you to think of going
swimming to-day before you have mowed
the grass every bit of it last satur-
day you yent off with that jenkins boy
and left everything you ought to be
old enough to look after things a little

why when i was your age-

  aw pa dont preach i com-
plained falling in with his mood i
guess a feller has got to have a little
fun on his vacation  

  and as we laughed at our own fool-
ishness in some way our surroundings
seemed to lose much of their relentless
ferocity and the cruel wilderness of
snow rolled back a thousand miles

  several days elapsed before we again
saw anything of the strange creature
who had so disturbed us then we savfr
it or at least one like it flying low
over the igloo-shack it did not stay
but only hesitated and the gloom of the
arctic night was so great that it was
lost to view when only a few rods
away

vt aybe he was just after a few
-- architectural ideas my com-
panion reasoned as we discussed the
visit but there was seriousness to his
look that belied the light remark

  a few days later-it was now nearer
the time for the spring appearance of
the sun and a twilight at twelve dif-
ferentiated the hour of noon from that
of midnight-we heard a droning sound
above and rushed out to see a large fly-

ing machine more fish-like than bird-
like against the light blue sky

  it circled and descended and as it
came lower we could see that it was
attended by several of the smaller fly-
ers such as we had recently seen

  corn dove back into the shack for the
gun

  wed better not shoot i cautioned
they may not be unfriendly

  almost as i spoke a stream of bright
yellow substance poured out of the large
ship like a round fluffy roll it seemed
as it descended toward the earth

  gas exclaimed corn and poison
gas i suppose too

  there was little wind and the long
roll instead of drifting away or fray-
ing out trailed quickly down to the
snow where it lay like a solid ridge
contrasting strongly with the white of
the drifts

  the ship circled and the heavy gas
following in its wake rapidly laid a ring
about us perhaps a quarter of a mile in
diameter but it didnt stop there

  dropping a little inside the ring it
spiraled toward us coming closer at
each turn

  it made a most ominous and for-
bidding sight and we both trembled
violently partly from cold and partly
from fear as we looked

soon the ship was almost over our
heads and at fairly close range

  shall i let em have it asked
corn raising the rifle

  you might try was my reply

  it was a repeating rifle and he fired
three shots in rapid succession noth-
ing happened the ship kept on cir-
cling and pouring out the yellow cloud

  here said corn handing me the
gun you see what you can do

  i took careful aim and fired

  listening sharply i thought i heard


amazing stories

the tap of the bullet striking some metal-
lic surface nothing else

   one by one i fired all the shells left in
the gun but all to no purpose

  and now the gas ridge was but a
few rods away

  lets get inside said corn and dove
for the igloo-shack

  i guess were up against it this
time i said following him

  it will be just by the mercy of hell
if wc escape said corn as he fas-
tened the door now i know what a
rat feels like in a trap

  after muffling the door as best we
could with a blanket we waited in
dreadful suspense

  we had not long to wait

  the sound of some heavy object drag-
ging  the ground came distinctly to
our strained ears and suddenly some-
thing broke through the icy roof half
burying us in debris and extinguishing
our light

  wed better get out of here before
the shack comes down on us i shouted
pulling the door open

  as we emerged we saw the yellow gas
all around us and a suspended grappling
hook as large as the shack itself clutch
at the walls this time the whole thing
collapsed like a house of cards the
ship was close overhead and the nau-
seating smell of the gas filled our nos-
trils

  we gasped for breath

  corn was carrying the rifle now re-
loaded

  dont shoot i warned as he raised
the gun its no use i guess they
have got the cinch on us it might only
make it worse

  corn dropped the rifle in the snow
and we stood fighting for breath

  maybe its better on the ground
corn gasped out and lay down

  no no i said its heavy gas
but the warning came too late he

started up but with a choking cough
lay back limply

  almost at the same instant a heavy
net dropped down from above falling
on the snow beside us

  my lungs seemed bursting the world
swam round me but i sensed dimly
that the attackers meant to pull us up in
the net out of the gas

  grabbing my companion i endeavored
to lift him into the net but my knees
were weak and he seemed as heavy as
lead i did however manage to drag
him on the slippery snow the three or
four intervening yards and roll him into
the net

  i remember falling over him and then
all was dark but i could feel myself
ascending as in an elevator

  the next thing i knew i was in a
small room lying on the floor

oitting up i found that corn was
 beside me fearing he might be
dead i reached out and grasped his arm
to my great satisfaction it was normally
yielding and after a vigorous shake he
slowly opened his eyes he stared about
uncomprehendingly

  i guess i must have passed out he
said where are we

  i dont know i said getting un-
steadily to my feet i just woke up

  there was a small round window like
a port hole and i looked out of it to
see only empty space straight ahead but
in the distance and far below were the
white snow fields of the earth en-
shrouded in dark gloom

  we must be up in the airship i
announced i remember there was a
net let down-

  corn struggled painfully to his feet
and came to my side

  yes he agreed they must be tak-
ing us for a ride well anyway its
something to be alive i dont feel sick
or anything do you
subjugating the earth



  no i said only groggy it must
be the gas wasnt poisonous it only
shut out the air

  for a while we stood at the little
window not saying much and watch-
ing the landscape hurrying by evi-
dently we were still ascending for it
gradually grew lighter while the earth
grew dimmer

  after a little while the ship swung a
little to the left and there was a spot
of golden light at the rim of the earth

  look said corn-as if i could be
doing anything else-its the sun

  sure enough it was first merely a
flat rim then slowly and gloriously the
whole orb rose above the level horizon

  to us who had not seen the sun for
months it was a marvelous sight we
had almost forgotten what a beautiful
sight a sunrise really was

  in spite of the gravity of our pre-
dicament we felt wonderfully heartened

  well this is not too bad a ride they
are giving us so far said the irre-
pressible corn i wonder what they
have to eat 

  i wonder too i said i hope its
not frozen fish-and i hope its not us
presently we seemed to be descending
again at least the earth now bright
and white rose slowly toward us and a
range of rugged hills appeared in the
distance they w-ere snow-clad and
treeless but in the side of the steepest
and highest we saw a dark blotch and
as we came closer we suddenly realized
that it was an opening in the side of the
mountain itself

  it looks like the mouth of some great
fish said corn i can imagine he is
going to swallow us

  maybe we have been captured by
the demons that inhabit the center of
the earth i ventured that book i
was telling you about argued that the
earth was only a hollow shell and the

author made out a pretty good case
too

  we passed a number of ponderous
aircraft coming toward us but could see
no one on board a minute later we
plunged into the gloom and alihost at
once there was a bumping sensation and
we came to a stand-still

 it was not entirely dark outside but
 the light was so dim we could see
 nothing but a patch of shadowy floor
 and a few large square columns a few
 vague forms were moving about in the
 distance

   the door of the little room in which
 we were immured swung open and there
 entered the strangest creature i had
 ever seen there was a compact body
 roughly the size and shape of a large
 wash boiler supported by four sturdy
 legs not greatly unlike tiny elephants
 legs from the center of the body
 which wras a little less than waist high
 rose a small and almost round trunk
 perhaps eight inches in diameter carry-
 ing six arms and supporting at a height
 considerably above our own a round
 head which seemed disproportionately
 large being twice the size of any hu-
 man head

   corn let out a gasp of astonishment
 and stood staring as i did in bewildered
 surprise it was i realized another
 individual such as i had seen at the
 fishing hole for there were the three
 eyes and the several arms but now
 the face no longer bundled up re-
 pealed a wide flat nose and an even
 wider mouth and tall slim ears that fol-
 lowed the contours of the round head
 with only a slight projection of chin
 or beard there were none but the en-
 tire creature was clothed in a glossy
 coat of short velvety brown hair

  the arms were about the size and
shape of human arms and the well
formed but slender hands seemed quite


amazing

stories

 human except for the disconcerting fact
 that there were too many of them

  the creature spoke words which we
could not understand in a deep rumbling
voice which seemed to come from far
down in his tubby iiterior seemingly
he was not at all surprised that we could
not understand him for he resorted
quite naturally to gestures and lieck-
oned with one of his uppermost pairs of
arms for us to follow him turning
about he led us across a wide deck down
a gangplank and out on the stone floor
of the cavernous room

  here he was joined by two others of
his kind these carried instruments
that looked like extra long flash lights
and which we took to be weapons here
we formed a procession headed by our
conductor corn and i following him
in single file and the other two evidently
acting as guards walking one on either
side and a little behind us

  their short legs moved with surpris-
ing rapidity and we had to step out
briskly to keep the pace

  straight back into the heart of the
mountain we went descending at a
gradual slope for perhaps ten minutes

  we could see no lamps but there was
unmistakably some sort of artificial
lighting for the floor was quite visible
as were the bottoms of the thick col-
umns which we passed at long intervals
and which rising to unseen heights faded
into the gloom

  at length wet with perspiration in-
duced by our rapid walk and our thick
clothing we came to a white wall and
entered an open door

  here in a well-lit room we found our-
selves confronted by perhaps a dozen
individuals all very much like our
guide and guards and all seated either
at tables of which there were two or
three or in groups i say seated for
lack of a more concise term they had
simply curled up their short legs and al-

lowed the tubby bodies to settle a foot
or more to the floor

  they bestirred themselves when we
entered and gathering round inspected
us and our clothing being careful to
keep at arms length away

  i suppose they are afraid of a sock
in the mug if they get too familiar
corn remarked wonder how they like
our looks

  one fellow taller and larger than the
rest and wearing a large glass over his
great eye asked our conductor a number
of questions and then dismissed us with
an authoritative gesture

  that bird looks and acts like a ger-
man lieutenant we captured in the war
muttered corn eyeglass and all

still guarded we were led on
through a narrow hall of stone walls
and into another room which was empty
save for a tall table and two or three
solid pieces of furniture which we were
unable to identify

  unceremoniously the door was shut
and we were left alone

  we threw off our hot coats and
looked about in a corner behind a low
wall was running water and what we
took to be strangely fashioned articles of
furniture

  we were glad enough of an oppor-
tunity to drink for our throats were dry
and parched after drinking and wash-
ing there seemed to be nothing to do
but to await developments

  do you think these things are hu-
man beings i asked

  no said corn not really human
beings but they have human intelli-
gence and they may have much better
brains than we have or even more than
ordinary people have the people who

know enough by- to stay in gods

country

  at last when we had thought our-
selves entirely deserted the door opened
subjugating the earth



again and one of the ungainly creatures
brought in a tray of food and oh
great day it was not frozen fish but
some sort of porridge made of cereal
we ate it with keen relish and although
corn expressed himself as disappointed
at not getting tea we did enjoy the
drink provided it tasted like weak
cocoa

  i hope the social functions for the
day are over said corn when the meal
was finished i am dog-tired

  there were no chairs and no beds
but we did find four or five pad-like
cushions and with them and our coats
we made ourselves fairly comfortable
com fell asleep at once but i lay awake
for a long time thinking or more cor-
rectly worrying

  who were these strange beings did
they make their home here in the
ground or was the earth really hollow
as some people thought and these the
inhabitants of an inner world  or
were they creatures from some other
planet what would they do with us
did they know anything of our world-
the world that was ours before we
came to the polar regions

  none of these questions seemed an-
swerable and at last i fell into the
deep sleep of exhaustion

  in the morning or after we had slept
about ten hours if i could believe my
watch we got up and made our simple
toilets needless to say we did not
shave nor comb our hair for we had
neither razor or comb in fact we had
nothing of our traveling kit except that
i had my sheath knife and corn his
fountain pen

  i wonder what these brown velvet
folks call themselves i said i sup-
pose we may as well call them the vel-
veteens until we get better acquainted
with them

  at this moment the door opened and
several of our captors entered two

of them were evidently guards for they
carried weapons or at least instruments
such as we had seen when coming off
the airship

  corn slid down from the corner of the
table where he had been perched and
bowed to them very ceremoniously

ood morning velveteens he
said with much cordiality but the
visitors only looked at him very much
as one observes the antics of an animal
in the zoo and came on

  one was the large individual with the
eyeglass whom we had seen the day be-
fore he seemed to be in charge

  as they gathered around us he ap-
peared to be pointing out and discussing
various details of our clothing and
anatomy

  the others said little but presently
one of them interjected some remark
that evidently struck a humorous note
for they all laughed a most rollick-
ing care-free laugh rolled out in heavy
deep voices a laugh that was utterly
contagious almost involuntarily we
laughed with them

  thank god they are human said
corn in a low voice one fellow carried
some sort of cabinet and to him the
spectacled one soon commenced to give
attention

  we gathered from his gestures that he
was giving instructions about something

  presently the rest departed leaving
the one with the cabinet and two guards
with us

  setting the cabinet on the table the
creature opened the lid and working with
four or five hands started doing some-
thing inside it

  gosh but cant they laugh said
com you know if i could laugh like
that i wouldnt do anything but laugh

  yes it was wond-

  -this is wiod wonderful isle

of dreams broke in a voice it was


amazing stories

the first human voice save our own
that we had heard for months and the
thrill of hearing it was indescribable

  a radio i gasped seizing corns
arm we rushed to look into the cab-
inet

  the operator regarded us with a
genial and triumphant smile a smile
that seemed to spread endlessly about
his great round head but the two
guards grabbed us roughly with hands
that seemed made of iron and hustled us
back to our former positions evidently
they intended to tolerate the taking of
no liberties

jthe operator shifted to some station
in the middle west where a pipe organ
recital was in progress and presently
stopped the machine and closed the lid

  and now he opened one of the pieces
of furniture about whose use we had
been speculating it proved to be some-
thing like a roll top desk and con-
tained what we took to be writing ma-
terials and quite an assortment of mis-
cellaneous articles

  i imagine he is a teacher i haz-
arded maybe he is going to teach us
to talk

  i was right he came and pointed
to the table blion he said enunciat-
ing very distinctly twice he repeated
it and then looked expectantly at me
blion i said trying to simulate his
pronunciation woof he said assent-
ingly and pointing again at the table
he looked questioningly at corn corn
responded blion woof said our
teacher

  from this beginning the knowledge
that blion meant table and woof
meant yes we progressed rapidly

  every day the instructor came and
spent several hours with us and since
we had little else to do and because we
were most anxious to know all about
these strange people and what they

meant to do with us we applied our-
selves wholeheartedly to learning prac-
tising when the teacher was gone and
reading from the rolls of parchment-
like material that served these people as
books

  little by little as we grew able to
understand our instructor told us of
the affairs of the velveteens cudors
they called themselves

  the information gained fragment by
fragment when pieced together made
a somewhat coherent story

  the velveteens lived on one of the
larger asteroids whether one of the six
hundred and more that have been
sighted and catalogued by earthly as-
tronomists or whether on some other is
uncertain

  at any rate this asteroid possessed
a land area of considerable extent and
was one of the few known to possess at-
mospheric conditions similar to those of
earth they called it marazon

  some twenty thousand years ago our
years their years were very much long-
er due to their greater orbit about the
sun they had reached a state of civil-
ization so far developed as to possess a
written language and consequently an
historical record

  throughout the centuries they had
made progress in mechanics and the sci-
ences and finally a hundred and fifty
years ago had succeeded in interplane-
tary flight or rather in interplanetoidal
flight for their travels had been con-
fined to the nearby planetoids whose or-
bits corresponded quite nearly to that of
marazon

  then a few years back strange noises
coming from somewhere in space had

  	the large number of small planet or asteroids
as they are called now known more than fill the gap
between the orbits of mars and jupiter they fill it
to overflowing their system of orbits is so compli-
cated however that if each orbit was represented
by a thin ring of steel wire one could lift them all by
moving only one-from pageant of th start by
luyten
subjugating the earth



commenced to disturb their radio recep-
tion in much the same manner as earthly
radio reception is troubled by what we
for want of a more explicit name call
static

  careful investigation involving a
great many experiments traced this dis-
turbance to earth and although they
were unable to make any sense of the
system of signals then in use by wire-
less amateurs here the matter served to
focus the attention of their scientists on
a planet that had hitherto been deemed
of little importance

  a study of the earths orbit and grav-
itational phenomena soon convinced them
that the planet earth was rich in use-
ful minerals ere long their highly per-
fected instruments located our north
magnetic pole which by the way is
several hundred miles from the true
north pole and their scientists con-
cluded that somewhere in the earth not
far from this point must be large de-
posits of super-magnetic material par-
ticularly nickel-iron such as often oc-
curs in meteorites

  the inhabitants of marazon had long
suffered from a wandering of the plan-
etoids axis of rotation similar to but
very much more pronounced than the
conical motion of the earths axis

  this had resulted in a troublesome
distortion of the seasons and was due
so they had discovered to a lack of mag-
netic deposits in a certain portion of
their little globe

  here then on earth they decided was
an abundance of material with which to
remedy this difficulty if only it could be
brought to marazon

  	in  a continuous scries of observations for
the study of variations of latitude was started at six
stations distributed around the earth on the parallel
of      from the whole mass of evidence it is
apparent that the movement of the terrestrial pole
is composed mainly of two motions one an annual rev-
olution in a narrow ellipse about  feet long as
measured at the surfacc of cither pole but varying
in form and position the other a revolution in a circle
of about  feet in diameter with a pwiod of about
 days-from russels astronomy

on the asteroid there were several
families of great wealth whose for-
tunes had been held together by a pro-
cess of legal incorporation for century
after century until they had become
permanent business institutions operated
but not entirely controlled by the vari-
ous organized branches of the family
grandsons perhaps a hundred times re-
moved from the founders of the for-
tune

  we gathered that the government of
the country wfas conducted on a much
more financial basis than our earthly
governments are outwardly at least
and one such organization known by a
name which loosely translated would
be the foundation had proposed to
organize an expedition to earth on con-
dition that the government would issue
a charter granting them ownership of
the planet and an agreement to buy from
them a certain amount of nickel-iron in
case it could be obtained and transported
economically

  the arrangement had been sanctioned
by the government of marazon and the
expedition sent out

  the scientists had readily located a
pressure wrinkle in the outer layers of
the earths crust not a great distance
from the magnetic pole and here hop-
ing to gain easy access to the nickel-iron
core of the earth they had started
operations

  large scale machinery was brought
and a vast tunnel several miles long
had been driven into the earths in-
terior

  it was in the outer reaches of this
great tunnel that we were now living

  at first the heat of the earths in-
terior had hampered operations but the
discovery of a large subterranean stream
of water had afforded a serviceable cool-
ing agent and the nickel-iron here
much closer to the earths surface than
elsewhere had been uncovered


amazing stories

  large quantities of the nickel-iron
we were told had already been sent
away to marazon and the venture was
deemed a financial success

  in the meantime earthly radio had
been progressing from the signal stage
to that of the modern speaking and
musical program and had excited much
interest and not a little admiration both
on the asteroid and here at the works

  of course the velveteens had been
unable to understand the oral pro-
grams but they had enjoyed the music
and deemed it of a very superior qual-
ity in fact it would seem that their
own musical development had not kept
pace with their scientific and mechanical
progress their instruments had re-
mained crude and their musical educa-
tion limited

  now that the mining work was well
under way the clan were giving consid-
erable attention to the matter of send-
ing out an exploring party to the rest
of the earth and the directors hoped
ultimately to possess themselves of some
of our music and perhaps many other
things of value

  it was on one such expedition that we
had been discovered and the large ship
had been sent out to bring us in with
the hope of securing information of both
musical and general nature and inci-
dentally of making us the property of
the foundation

this last was a most discouraging
revelation although it was not very
surprising considering the high-handed
manner in which we had been taken into
custody

  i am afraid i said to corn one day
that i shall prove almost a dead loss
to the foundation i have no musical
talent and am in fact practically tone
deaf

  i only wish i were that way too

he said then they would probably let
us both go

  as a matter of fact corn was an ac-
complished musician and when ques-
tioned by the instructor was able to ex-
plain many of the technicalities of earth-
ly band and orchestra music that were
so much greek to me

  one day our instructor announced
that i was to go to see otarch the di-
rector-he of the monocled eye-at the
conclusion of our study period

  it seemed rather strange that he
would have me come alone without
corn and all during the lesson i was
trying to puzzle out what it portended
when it was time to go i took leave of
my companion with a good deal of mis-
giving

  im trying not to be jealous of you
said corn as i left maybe next time
the honor will be mine

  by this time we had learned that
otarch was one of the senior directors
of the foundation and that he was in
full charge of the earth end of the ex-
ploitation project so i felt sure that
something of importance was about to
occur

  when i arrived in his presence he
looked at me critically and i thought
disapprovingly

  your instructor tells me you have no
musical talent he said severely in a
voice that made me feel like a criminal
brought to judgment is that true
he demanded fixing me with all three
of his eyes

  yes i admitted it is true

  well you should have told the in-
structor before he wasted all this time
on you he thundered angrily now
what are we going to do

  it seemed a most unreasonable ques-
tion to expect me to answer but evi-
dently he required an answer for he
waited expectantly

  well i said after a moment i
subjugating the earth



suppose you will have to consider that
your hard luck thats what i have
always done

  the great face relaxed and he
laughed jovially

  fair enough he said if it worked
for you it ought to be good enough for
us

  evidently his severity had been some-
thing in the nature of a joke for he
now continued in a matter-of-fact and
businesslike way

  in connection with our work here
we are going to start a tourist bureau
sightseers from marazon are going to
be given a tour of the earth in specially
constructed aircraft now being shipped
from home now of course we have
conductors but what we need is a bally-
hoo man some one to explain the sights
and answer questions im going to
send you out to do this

  this was totally unexpected it came
like a bolt from the blue and my
thoughts were scattered in confusion

  you dont mean to say-you dont
intend to go into parks and buildings
and-places 

  ah no we intend to stay up a mile
or more and view things through our
high powered observing glasses i sup-
pose there would be complications with
the local population if we were to
land

  we shall have to leave close-up in-
spection until we have established some
sort of authority and we dont care
to bother with that until we have
realized a little more income from this
enterprise

i was not only surprised but great-
ly exasperated

  are your people only pirates and
savages i asked rashly that you
have no respect for the rights of oth-
ers had you any right to take my
partner and me by force and bring us

here and hold us prisoners and make
slaves of us have you no sense of
right and wrong of justice or com-
mon decency

  he looked at me with a whimsical ex-
pression but he spoke gravely enough

  why yes of course we have a
highly developed appreciation of these
things but the highly civilized natur-
ally have privileges denied to the lower
orders we are only exercising our rea-
sonable rights our higher intelligence
and more advanced civilization places the
world in our keeping

  you dont consult the wishes of your
domestic animals do you but the gap
between your domestic animals and
yourselves is probably not much greater
than that between ourselves and you as
for justice in your case we give as
much as we receive while you are
serving us you are receiving the bene-
fits of living in a highly intellectual and
cultural environment and you need have
no worry about your daily wants they
will be taken care of

  i fail to see any of this super-in-
telligence you speak of i objected

  have you or any of your people ever
been able to leave the earth and its at-
mosphere to visit any other world

  i admitted we had not

  if you had our intelligence you could
do so declared ottarch

  do you or any of your people know
what gravity is or how to regulate it
he went on again i was obliged to
admit we knew nothing

  well he said that goes to prove
your inferiority we know all about
it we know how to give to any ob-
ject several times its normal weight or
how to make the heaviest metal light
as water

  but i argued aside from scientific
attainment is law and justice how do
you expect to make any treaties or other
arrangements with my people the people


amazing stories

of earth if when you visit inhabited re-
gions you do not respect my rights as a
citizen 

  otarch smiled blandly

 we do not mean to make any
treaties he said we only intend to
establish our dominance when your
race is convinced of its own inferority
and helplessness it will not question our
rights

  after dividing the country into dis-
tricts we shall reorganize the govern-
ments and introduce our system of in-
dustry and finance i shall be em-
peror of the great central city and gov-
ern the surrounding territory my elder
brother will be emperor of the tall city
on the east coast of what you call amer-
ica my uncle will be emperor of the
largest city on the eastern continent and
so on each director of the founda-
tion will if he wishes have jurisdiction
over a part of the earth

  some of them may reside for a time
each season in their own principality
others will only send agents and gov-
ernors

f course all metals and natural
resources will remain the prop-
erty of the foundation as provided in
the original charter

  but all that is in the future you
will go now to new quarters in the
tourist bureau there they will try to
renew your garments so that you will
look as nearly like a typical earth-man
as possible for the benefit of the trip-
pers they will be coming in in a few
davs

     

  but my friend i objected will
he not go with me

  no we have other plans for him
was the cool reply he is already on
his way to marazon his musical ability
will we hope render him a valuable
asset

  our county needs more and better
music

  with a wave of the hand he dismissed
me and turned to receive some one
who had been waiting

  the guards hustled me away

  any attempt to describe my thoughts
and emotions would be futile

  there were moments of grief of
furious anger of incredulity and utter
discouragement as i realized that corn
was gone that i was to be little better
than a slave and that the whole earth
was in danger of ruthless subjugation

  arrived at my new quarters i was
left alone in a small room bare ex-
cept for a high table to think of my
predicament

  how would corn fare alone among
these strange despots did they really
think they were superior to us could
it be they really were would they
be able to overcome the nations of the
earth and become its rulers

  did they have any superior weapons
besides the gas what would they do
after securing absolute control

  all these questions beat insistently
upon my brain but i could find a con-
clusive answer to none of them

it was long hours later that i finally
fell asleep considering the statements
of the would-be emperor of chicago
that things could be made to have two or
three times their normal weight and
then i dreamed the old dream that had
not troubled me since boyhood a dream
that i think affects all children some-
thing dreadful was chasing me across a
wide field at first i ran at a good
pace then my feet and legs grew heav-
ier and heavier and i could hardly run
at all presently i could only walk but
the dreadful thing was so close behind
me that i dared not stop in order to
make any progress i had to lean over
and claw myself along with my hands
subjugating the earth



then i was down on my knees and fin-
ally lying down pulling my heavy cum-
bersome shape along by grasping the
grass and clawing into the ground with
fingers and toes

  i awoke trembling and sweating and
slept no more that night in the morn-
ing modu made his appearance modu
was assistant manager of tours and he
radiated efficiency from every pore

  i was to go with him he said observe
all that he did and said and so learn as
much as possible about the tourist busi-
ness but first we must attend to my
beard and long hair

  he took me to a hairdresser who fol-
lowing my directions trimmed my hair
and my bushy beard converting it from
what had threatened to be a van dowie
into a neat van dyke never having
had any use for razors these folks of
course had none and having worn no
clothing save for decorations at feasts
and celebrations had but little cloth and
of course no skill in tailoring for such
queerly shaped persons as earth dwellers

 we need not worry about your
clothing said modu we have word
that an airplane with four passengers is
being brought in some of these pas-
sengers will no doubt be dressed in
clothing suitable for your work and we
will make an exchange

  so there were to be other prisoners
i thought other victims of the ruth-
less tactics of the emperor of chicago
this wearing of some strangers clothes
seemed little short of barbarous but
i knew it would be useless to object

  since modu had taken me in charge
there had been no guard in evidence
but i noticed that modu was careful not
to let me get out of his sight and i
suspected that the guard was still some-
where in the background

  a hotel for the expected tourists was
btig fitted up with bar rooms dining
rooms and sleeping apartments and

modu was busy going about seeing that
everything was properly arranged

  the sleeping rooms were provided
with telephones radio sets and televi-
sion instruments and various other me-
chanical devices but no beds and no
chairs there were however a great
many cushions and pads of various
sizes and shapes and each room had a
tall table

  and now i learned for the first time
how a cudor took his ease and how he
retired for the night

 a cudors bed was nothing more
elaborate than a long strip of fine soft
netting perhaps a yard wide this was
hung in a loop from a hook in the
ceiling or some other convenient fast-
ening and in its low hanging loop mr
cudor simply leaned the upper part of
his slim trunk and his heavy head and
so rested or slept with his feet and the
broad base of his tubby body resting flat
on the floor perhaps on a pad or
cushion

  an ordinary business suit even to
hat and shoes was brought for my
use as modu had foretold but when
i asked as to the fate of the erstwhile
owner i could obtain little informa-
tion

  modu said that the airplane had been
taken in order to study its mechanism
and that its former occupants would be
held to await the pleasure of the resident
director otarch

  when i found the shoes quite too
small for me they were taken away and
replaced by a pair that proved a size
or two too large but that were much to
be preferred to my heavy frontier boots

  interplanetary ships huge cigar-
shaped craft with no visible means of
propulsion commenced to appear bring-
ing dozens of trippers and soon it was
evident that the tourist season was on
it was with a strange mixture of pleasant


amazing stories

anticipation and discouraged dejection
that i set out with the first group of
tourists one morning to fly south i
was to see again my native land after
so many vicissitudes but not intimately
and as a free citizen only from a
height and as a slave amid unearthly
creatures

  our conveyance was of much the
same shape as the one in which corn
and i had been brought to  the subter-
ranean world and furnished ample
room for saloon and sleeping accom-
modations for the two dozen passengers
and a crew of three besides the tour di-
rector

  our craft was painted in gay colors
and bedecked with bunting and pennants
as for a gala occasion everyone was
in holiday spirits

  outside the great cavern it was
spring much of the snow was gone
and here and there a mirror-like surface
proclaimed open water and as we
traveled south we met long v-shaped
strings of wild geese and hurrying flocks
of ducks coming back to their summer
quarters when after an interval of
swift travel the bleak and rocky land-
scape gave way to green meadows and
stretches of forest and a faint odor of
growing things mounted up to us on the
sweet south wind i experienced a thrill
of delight that even my sense of servi-
tude and the insistent questions of the
trippers were powerless to dispel

  at a height of about five thousand
feet and a speed of about four hundred
miles an hour we passed several rivers
and other landmarks that i was unable
to recognize and presently came in
sight of a wide river which i instantly
knew for the st lawrence with its
shores divided into long narrow fields
abutting on the water and leading far
back at right angles to the shore

  as i was explaining with diligent
search of my limited vocabulary the

nature and colonial origin of the narrow
farms some black with fresh plowing
some green with growing grain and
some white with blossoming orchards
we came in sight of quebec in the dis-
tance

  clear and bright it stood in the
morning light the upper town perching
airily on its high mountain and the
sailing ships and ocean liners crowding
the glittering river it was a beautiful
sight and the cudors greeted it with
enthusiasm and in my attempts to
tell of the ocean-growing traffic the
plains of abraham and various other
things i lost my feeling of enslavement
and inferiority and became at least for
the moment a showman

  i had always had a great affection for
quebec and the lovely st lawrence
river greeting them as old friends on
my return from england on sundry oc-
casions how little i had thought then
as we passed under the great bridge and
approached the harbor that one day i
would be a rubberneck man on an air-
ship piloting a weird collection of
denizens of another world

  at one time or another i had flown
over much of the united states
and some of south america but i was
rather dubious about my ability to rec-
ognize some of the cities and many of
the landmarks from such a height as
we were traveling and at such tremend-
ous speed

  we found new york city wrapped in
a deep fog and as we flew over only
the tallest of its great buildings tow-
ered up out of the whiteness like so
many giants issuing from the depths of
the sea then we turned west crossing
the beautiful rolling country of the
finger lakes district skirted lake
erie and soon sighted lower lake mich-
igan and the smokes of chicago

  as i was telling of the sudden growth
subjugating the earth



and economic importance of the city
we turned south and a sudden and un-
mistakable odor made it necessary for
me to launch into a description that i
had meant to pass by very lightly that
of the business of the stockyards

  still bearing south we passed over
the great development at mussel shoals
turned west to the mississippi followed
the great stream down to new orleans
and the delta and struck out across the
gulf for the canal zone

  all the great developments and engi-
neering accomplishments including the
panama canal the cudors regarded in
much the same manner as we look at a
beaver dam or the efforts of primitive
savages in building a big-game trap

  time and space forbids my describing
our trip over south america and then
east over africa and the great contin-
ents of europe and asia and our re-
turn to our base after several days of
continuous flying

  during our voyage we had sighted a
great many aircraft of various kinds
but our tour director assured us that
there was no chance of their molesting
us because of our superior speed and
the fact that we were armed with the
gravity projector

  this mention of the gravity projector
was the first intimation i had had of the
nature of the weapor with which the
cudors intended to establish their mas-
tery over the earth this weapon i of
course did not understand and no ex-
planation was vouchsafed at this time

  arriving at headquarters we found
that more tourists had come and modu
immediately assigned me to a tour that
was to cover the west coast of america
including the land of ten thousand
smokes and the aleutian islands

  my next trip took me away to the
fjords of norway and the steppes of si-
beria and over the chinese wall when
i returned i learned that another sight-

seeng craft belonging to the founda-
tion had been attacked by anti-aircraft
guns and airplanes while flying over a
city in europe-what city i was unable
to learn-and had been nearly wrecked
it had been a well-planned surprise at-
tack  and only the great speed and
prompt use of the gravity projector had
averted disaster

that was more serious the four
  prisoners who had been immured
in the cavern had escaped from their
quarters appropriated a sightseeing fly-
er and attempted to fly out of the great
tunnel but they had crashed into an
idle excavating machine the flyer had
been utterly demolished and all four
had been killed

  all this i heard from modu on arriv-
ing at the station he also said that he
had orders to place me under strict
guard and to send me to the director

  otarch i found in a towering rage

  you people are acting like fools he
greeted me you havent even as much
intelligence as i had expected its really
a shame for creatures of such ignorance
to have possession of a whole planet
it seems impossible that people with a
written language-and even with fly-
ing machines-could be so backward

  -how great is your population

  counting the less progressive
races there are more than a
thousand million

  do you mean to say there are some
even lower intellectually than the oth-
ers we have had here

  we are of the highest type of man-
kind i answered there are many
races who are savage with no gov-
ernment no machinery-not even any
clothes

  clothes he echoed are they a
mark of superiority do you wear


amazing stories

them when it is not necessary as pro-
tection against the cold

  why yes i explained we wear
them indoors and out we have an
idea that they make for elegance and
dignity and there is a deep-seated super-
stition that they make for modesty as
between the sexes

  he regarded me with a look of in-
credulity

  superstition is a common enemy he
observed superstition has always re-
tarded progress we are still the slaves
of a number of minor ones

  you can go back to your work
now he continued severely but i
warn you that if you attempt any
tricks or any disobedience you will be
executed instantly the behavior of the
prisoners and that of the people who
attacked our sightseers have strained
our patience to the limit and there will
be no leniency only the fact that you
have proven tractable and that your
companion is doing good work on mar-
azon has so far deterred me from advis-
ing the board of directors to exterminate
your whole race-or at least confine
them to a few remote reservations

  he turned away and the two guards
hustled me back to the tourist station i
was angry and humiliated but i swal-
lowed my indignation what else could
i do at least otarch had inadvert-
ently given me a crumb of comfort
corn was still living

  during the next few weeks i made
several world-tours all under the watch-
ful eye of a guard then came the
first movement of aggression against the
people of the earth and how was it
announced modu calmly told me that
a new feature was to be added to the
tourists entertainment

  those who so desired and were furn-
ished with special tickets were to be
taken to see the building of the great
ornamental fence and land-marker that

was to divide the chicago territory from
the adjoining districts only a char-
itable consideration for the printers
feelings prevents me from showing
how chicago was written in cordu

  this area to be known as the em-
pire of chicago was to be many hun-
dred square miles in extent in fact the
fence was to start at the upper end of
lake superior extend south almost to
st louis then east to the ohio river
make a wide curve and come back to
the shore of lake erie allowing the
four great lakes thus spanned to form
the northern boundary

  i realized of course that there would
be opposition to this undertaking that
it would in fact precipitate a war of
the races and a show-down as to cudor
supremacy and so i awaited the out-
come with anxiety and misgiving

the most exasperating and discour-
aging part of it all was the realiza-
tion that i must remain a mere onlook-
er powerless to help or hinder either
side i wondered if ever before in all
history a man had been placed in such
an unenviable position that of having
to exhibit for others entertainment the
subjugation of his own people

  evidently the cudors were not an-
ticipating any serious difficulty since
they were not even suspending the tour-
ist activities during the period that they
must have known would witness every
effort of the earth people to repel the
invaders

  of course mankind could have no
knowledge of the intentions of the ag-
gressors or of the extent of their
strength in all probability i reasoned
they could have no knowledge of the
great development of the cudors in
the far north but they must know
something of their presence on earth
from having seen so many of their swift
aircraft around the globe that they
subjugating the earth



considered these flyers a menace was
made plain by the attack in europe

  at any rate it would seem that by
this time they should be thoroughly
aroused to the fact that some sort of
extra-terrestrial creatures were abroad
i tried to imagine what the newspapers
and the radio would be saying about the
strange swift craft obviously so much
superior to any earthly machines radio
had been denied to me ever since i had
been transferred to the tourist bureau

  i tried in vain to study out some
scheme whereby i might give some
warning of the magnitude and details of
the plot which was being perfected i
cursed myself for a fool that i had not
at least dropped overboard from the
airship a letter telling of the cudors
plot during one of my earlier voyages
now of course it was too late i was
under guard all the time watched both
night and day my first trip to the
scene of the fence building-the start
was being made at the lake erie end-
convinced me that there was to be no
delay in offering opposition to the
cudors

  with a full quota of sightseers we ar-
rived over the lake shore and soon we
made out that the operations were be-
ing carried on between two long lines of
yellow smoke-screen extending away
out into the lake anc for a dozen miles
inland

  flying low we made out that a wide
foundation of metal evidently nickel-
iron was being laid down and on this
was being erected the boundary fence
proper it consisted of a series of
great square columns perhaps fifty feet
wide and two hundred feet high sur-
mounted by a continuous high-pitched
roof the spaces between the columns
were spanned by a screen work of very
close and intricate design

  several lengths of this screen were
already in position and the observation

glass revealed a scroll written in gigan-
tic letters reaching from top to bottom
of all the panels

  presently one of the tourists read
aloud erected by the first emperor
of chicago in the first year of his
beneficent reign in commemoration

of- but the rest of the legend

was still in the making and he was
obliged to refer to the tour-leaflet to
find out its eventual completion

hp he structure was so tall and gigan-

  - tic it seemed utterly impossible that
the builders could be contemplating its
extension for over a thousand miles to
take in the whole chicago territory but
the magnitude of the machines at work
on the ground and the great freighter
airships that were bringing materials in-
dicated the invaders ability to carry
on in herculean style

  i referred to the printed information
in the tourist hand-book and read

  this artistic land-marker is being
erected entirely of metal from the
earths core and is being molded into
place on the grounds entirely by me-
chanical means the actual operations
are being directed by television and
remote control from the foundations
field office in the north gas is be-
ing used to prevent the natives from
interfering with or destroying the work
when the machinery now under con-
struction is placed in operation it will
be capable of building twenty-five miles
a day the natives of this area will
all be marked with an inscribed ring
either about the wrist or neck and will
be required to stay always within the
limits of the fence

  it seemed strange there were no air-
planes flying about to at least observe
what these marauders were building
but the reason was soon apparent

  high above us hanging almost mo-


amazing stories

tionless in the sky was a large cudor
flying machine and from it issued a
group of their red rays of bright light
that gradually spread apart to form a
cone in the air and when directed to
the ground marked out a circular pat-
tern composed of several dozen brilliant
red spots

   its the gravity intensifier one of the
passengers explained for the benefit of
his fellows its one of the largest ever
built has an effective range of over
fifty miles i heard a description of
it over the radio last week it is capable
of tripling the weight of any substance
more dense than water the power is
broadcast from marazon

  but i thought magnetism was invis-
ible objected one and these beams
are a bright red

  no the beams of light are not the
active agent their only use is to in-
dicate accurately the direction in which
the force is being sent and the field
that is being covered merely a con-
venience to the oper- wait he

interrupted himself here comes an en-
emy flyer lets see what happens

  indeed a large multiple-motored bi-
plane was approaching from the east
and as our own pilot put on speed to
carry us out of danger we saw the
cone of light beams flicker about uncer-
tainly for a moment and then envelop
the plane

  at the same time we heard a ter-
rific roar from the ship above and
almost at once the airplane which had
been flying on a level started to settle
toward the ground waveringly and
unsteadily

  you see its wings are too small to
support its increased weight said one
of our passengers it will probably
crash but it didnt when it was
very low the cone suddenly leaped away
and the hard-pressed plane like a bird
that has shaken off the pursuit of the

hawk straightened out in smooth flight
and sailed away back in the direction
whence it had come

  but another one that came from the
opposite direction a few minutes later
did not fare so well when it was
enveloped by the long cone we saw
the ends of its wings bend and turn
upward and then suddenly one of them
crumpled and the plane went hurtling
earthward leaving a dense black stream
of smoke behind it a moment later we
could make out only a black and tangled
mass of wreckage

upon searching the landscape care-
fully we discovered that there
were a number of such wrecks it
seemed probable that there had been
a massed attack by aircraft and that
they had been routed

  i was quite overcome by the blood-
curdling display but the trippers viewed
it with shouts of delight and enthusiasm

  i felt an almost uncontrollable im-
pulse to rush at them in a furious at-
tack  but the guard was as usual watch-
ful of my slightest move and i was
obliged to calm my feelings as best i
could

  at this juncture the tour conductor
came on deck to say that it was being
reported by wireless that a large army
mostly tanks and artillery was coming
up from the south

	   

turning our attention in that
direction we see that there is
indeed a large force on the way
it extends for miles our powerful ob-
servation glass is turned toward it and
the shadowy moving mass springs into
detail

  crossing a meadow are rows on rows
of horse-drawn cannon the sleek well-
groomed horses are moving gingerly
and the artillerymen are cocked jauntily
on the gun carriages and here a little
subjugating the earth



way to the left are heavier guns mas-
sive howitzers and mortars hauled by
tractors that cut deep into the soil and
leave the turf behind them looking as
if it had been plowed still further
to the left is a paved highway along
which are moving long-barrelled wicked-
looking cannon mounted on their own
motor-driven trucks and dwarfing the
horse-drawn guns until they seem mere
toys beyond these on a steep hill-side
swarms of caterpillar tanks all moving
along at the same speed like a horde
of tussock moths going up a tree trunk

  still further on the crest of the hill
is covered by marching men whether
volunteer or regular troops i am unable
to decide

  away to the right are swarms of
quick-moving men horses and machines
there seems to be no order in their
movements they rush about like so
many excited ants when their ant hill
has been broken into but among them
a slightly raised smooth graded fill is
appearing and behind them as if grow-
ing by magic several lines of railway
spring into being to accommodate a long
line of giant guns that come sliding
along each mounted on and extending
over several flat cars and appearing in-
describably grim and powerful

  they are evidently improvising a spur
to the permanent railway line that
crosses a long trestle bridge a mile
to the west where a long train loaded
with guns and ammunition creeps along
as though uncertain of its footing

  and now we can see the wide ring
of red spots moving quickly over the
landscape like some sprightly moth airily
searching for nectar-filled flowers

at the long bridge it comes to rest
il for a moment and we heard
the distant but ominous roar as the pro-
jecting ship high in air receives and
transmits its power

  the long bridge sags in the middle
and crumples as a thing of wax and
the train writhing and breaking into
sections tumbles to the bottom of the
valley

  now the ring of bright spots shifts
to inclose the railway construction al-
most instantly all activity ceases

  we see the horses first fall to their
knees and then topple over men stand
still with their feet set firmly on the
ground trying to support their sudden
great weight some succeed for a few
moments others are on their knees
or on all fours and still others are
lying flat

  most of the tractors sink deep into
the ground and come to a standstill

  the great cannons on the railway
spur crush the cars under them and
some roll off the sides of the sagging
trucks

  but one section of the horse-drawn
artillery has halted and is unlimbering
for action several guns roar out and
we see white puffs of shrapnel blossom
in the air far up toward the projecting
ship presently the cone of bright rays
shifts to encompass this sector a few
more shrapnel explosions occur but they
are so low as to seem very futile and
our glass shows the artillery horses
kneeling or falling down and the artil-
lery men moving slowly if at all

   one fellow i notice is passing a shell
to a gunner when it suddenly becomes
heavy he staggers hangs on deter-
minedly and tries to get his arm under
it tt gets away from him and falls
to the ground he makes a desperate
but unsuccessful effort to pick it up
again and falls on top of it

  all the actions of the men recall most
vividly my ancient nightmare- recently
repeated

  here and there gun carriages break
down and all activity ceases

  but the circle of red spots is enlarg-


amazing stories

ing and is soon shifting to take in a
large section of the marching infantry
the columns halt waver and break in
confusion soldiers staggering in all di-
rections drop their guns and fall some
turn back and slowly creep toward the
rear the ray shifts back to the artil-
lery where some of the men are get-
ting up from the ground and moving
about their activity is short-lived a
few minutes suffice to halt the whole
advancing army even the motors on
the highway find their loads too heavy
to pull and come to a standstill

  now the air ship moves a little to
the right and perhaps half a mile out
toward the lake and turns loose a large
white bubble the bubble comes floating
down

obviously it is filled with heavy
gas and i hear the tour conductor
explaining that it is probably a modifica-
tion of the gas used in marazon to ex-
terminate beetles and other pests of the
fields

  it soon becomes apparent that it is
being carried so far to the left that it
will miss the army altogether

  the ship shifts still more to the
right and lets go another a larger one
this time and while this is coming
down they continue to shift their posi-
tion slowly and liberate a whole series
of the great bubbles

  i have no doubt they are designed to
break up on making contact with the
ground but to my surprise the leading
bubble explodes forming a wide flat
cloud of bluish white a thousand feet
in the air the cloud settles waveringly
but rapidly

  perhaps some gunner has made a
lucky shot and hit it there is still
some shooting going on in remote sec-
tors but when the next one and the
next explode at about the same level
it becomes obvious that they have been

designed to do so but whether actu-
ated by atmospheric pressure gauge or
a time device i can only surmise

  all these clouds settling on various
sections of the army hide them from
view meanwhile the arch of red spots
moves slowly and methodically about
covering each sector every few minutes

  it was a fearsome sight and the
thought of all the helpless soldiers dying
there like so many pestilential insects
is too much for my nerves i turned
away determined to look no more

  soon the tourists became restless the
affair was no longer spectacular the
conductor gave the word to go ahead
and we were off

  presently i am answering questions
as usual yes that was a lake and not
a very deep one the dark green patches
are corn fields the white people had
learned to raise corn from the aboriginal
race whom they had driven out and
superseded yes there were a few
indians left they were not very greatly
different from ourselves except that
their skins were red

  yes there must have been a wind-
storm a tornado very recently these
tornadoes often tore up trees and de-
molished buildings in this part of the
country

  no that was not liquid and the waves
were not real it was only the undula-
tion of the heads of a great field of
ripe wheat stirred by the wind

  no i couldnt say why all the big
barns on the farms were red and all
the little houses white except that this
was a time-honored custom no noth-
ing religious or superstitious about it
just style and habit

grain stacks were always built round
and conical in order to protect the heads
of the bundles of grain from the
weather

  no it was not really essential to
have a steeple on a church
subjugating the earth



coming back two days later to
headquarters i learned that the
earthly army had been completely
routed and the few survivors scattered
in all directions

  this was as i expected but the news
was crushing none the less it seemed
to me now that the human race was
doomed to a life of inferiority and
subjection

  i could imagine no possible way in
which a people no matter how deter-
mined could successfully fight these
cudors whose airships by decreasing
their own weight could withdraw far be-
yond the ceiling of earthly aircraft and
the highest range of anti-aircraft guns
in case lighter craft and longer range
guns were invented i knew the cudors
could withdraw even beyond the limits
of the atmosphere by using their inter-
planetary flyers

  other governments -notably the brit-
ish realizing that this invasion marked
a world crisis sent expeditions to co-
operate with the american forces and
attacked the invaders or rather tried to
attack the machines of the invaders
working on the great fence but they
all succumbed to the same tactics that
had routed the first great army and
the transportation of troops for this
campaign called the attention of the
cudors scouts to the presence of the
great war fleets and not only the
american and the english but all the
other fighting craft that could be found
afloat were promptly sunk no warn-
ings were given and no attempts were
made to rescue the crews

  these sinkings always occurred in
clear weather a large airship would
appear high in the sky and the circle
of red spots on the water would in-
dicate that the boat had been located
in a few minutes the battleship would
commence to settle deeper and deeper
in the water and in half an hour she

would be completely submerged and
would sink sometimes the lifeboats
if only partly loaded would be able to
survive but many men endeavoring to
swim at once sank and were drowned

  meanwhile in the chicago district
the building of the great fence went on
apace and similar structures were started
to bound various other tracts in america
and abroad i learned that there was
to be the new york city district taking
in several adjoining states the new
england district including boston the
new orleans district and so on eng-
land was to have a fence cutting off
london and the home counties from
scotland and the midlands and europe
and asia were to be criss-crossed in
several directions by the emperors
fences

  the fences after being completed were
left unprotected but in case the earthly
inhabitants tore them down or damaged
them as happened in several localities
the whole neighborhood was quickly
drenched with lethal gas which destroyed
even the vegetation everywhere it per-
meated the damage to the fences was
later repaired

  these fences had no gates highways
and railroads were torn up and closed


one day upon returning from a
south american tour modu
told me that the manager re-
quired me for other work and i was
to report to him at once

  when i presented myself the man-
ager said i am going to send you
down to chicago to take care of some
work for me i am undertaking a dis-
ciplinary measure that requires personal
attention

  i mean to put a nickel-iron ring
around all of my subjects right wrists
bearing a number and the inscription
subject of the emperor of chicago
amazing

stories

  i have had a machine prepared which
will mold such a ring on the arm of
each subject without seriously burning
the flesh such a machine capable of
casting a hundred thousand rings a day
will be set down outside the city and
i am going to send you to call on the
inhabitants to come in orderly fashion
to be tagged and to see to it that the
work is carried out promptly

  the emperor of new york will do
the same and all other districts will
follow suit

  i was so staggered by this bare-faced
proposal that i could only gasp with
anger

  i cant do it i declared when i
had found my voice its impos-
sible the people would kill me if i
attempted to be your agent in any such
undertaking

  that will be your misfortune was
the managers calm rejoinder if they
kill you i shall have to try some other
method then he regarded me a mo-
ment thoughtfully and meditatively

  of course he continued we can
safeguard you to some extent by threat-
ening retaliations in case you are at-
tacked i can promise to depopulate
half the city half the country districts
if you are killed there are so many
earth-inhabitants that we have no need
for conservation destroying a few mil-
lions might impress the rest and render
them more tractable

  your guard will now take you to
have your own wrist ring made and my
secretary will prepare for you a set of
printed instructions and provide you
with a radio broadcasting instrument
the applying of the identification ring
proved to be a fearsome and painful
operation

  i was required to thrust my right arm
at full length through a small hole in
the side of a ponderous and forbidding

machine for a few minutes nothing
happened then my hand and arm were
slowly gripped by a hard cold mech-
anism that nearly crushed them a thin
wisp of smoke issued from the machine
and something hot excruciatingly hot
bit into my wrist almost involuntarily
my muscles contracted and i found my-
self pulling and straining with all my
might to pull my arm away a hopeless
attempt

  i pulled my hand out to find both
hand and arm bright red from the heat
on the wrist was a bright heavy band
an inch wide and weighing no less than
a pound

  it fitted my wrist rather loosely one
of the guards examined it

tt is a little too loose he said but
a perhaps it will do you see the
size of the ring is gauged by the weight
of your body as you stand on the plat-
form  and in case your build is not
entirely symmetrical the ring is nat-
urally a bit too tight or too loose

  later alone in my quarters with two
guards stationed outside the door i
bathed my arm in cool water and read
the inscription standing out in bold let-
ters on the ring subject of the em-
peror of chicago  no 

  the skin of my wrist seemed unin-
jured and the burn was only superficial
but the anger and humiliation i felt
burned deeper and deeper

  the next morning my secretary came
and took me still under guard to the
broadcasting station which had been set
up for my use it was housed in quite
a large building which as the secretary
explained was erected in sections and
would be set down with me in chi-
cago to become my headquarters when
the necessary arrangements were com-
pleted the broadcasting station was en-
tirely automatic in its operation i was
subjugating the earth



told and required no more attention
than a receiving set

  the microphone was housed in a small
glass cabinet and opening the door to
this effected the necessary contacts to
put the station in operation

  it was tuned to a wide band of wave
lengths the secretary explained and had
power enough to blanket out all amer-
ican stations

  my orders were you will broadcast
this message at once and await further
instructions saying this the secretary
handed me a printed sheet and took his
departure

  i translated the message

  this is the executive office of the
emperor of chicago calling for his
subjects within the city and county
bounded and set apart by his majestys
metal fence

  in order that all individuals of a
stated age may be registered and pro-
vided with proper identification a sta-
tion will be prepared near the city-
the exact location to be made known
later-and all subjects will be directed
to report to this station in groups of one
hundred thousand each day beginning
one week from to-day

  local officers are called upon to di-
vide the territory into districts of ap-
proximately one hundred thousand
inhabitants that each section may be
assigned a registration date

  any attempt to evade this registra-
tion will meet with stern displeasure
of his majesty and will result in the
immediate execution of those refusing
to comply with this edict

  it was with a strange feeling of un-
reality that i took the microphone out
of its cabinet and started to recite this
repulsive message it did not seem pos-
sible that my voice was reaching the
people in and about chicago from this
far northern and far underground re-
moteness

  my voice sounded husky and weird
and i tried in vain to picture the peo-
ple listening to this message with their
receiving sets

 a ccording to instructions i was
l required to repeat the message in
an hour the second ime the perform-
ance seemed to me more real and plau-
sible and it seemed more as though i
were speaking to real people needless
to say i had little heart for the thing
i was forced to do and had it not been
that i believed that any disobedience on
my part would lead to my elimination
and to even more drastic methods of
subjugation for my people not only in
the chicago district but in all the world
i would rather have been struck dumb
than to be the cudors mouthpiece

  already there had been i knew not
how many millions of deaths

  i felt that i was only an instrument
in the hands of fate and i hoped dimly
that in some way i might be of some
service in mitigating the bitter lot of
my unfortunate race

  two days later i was taken out in a
small flyer and carried over the windy
city in order to choose a locality for
the registrating station

  the most advantageous place seemed
to be the great water-front park and
here together with the radio station
and the numbering machine i was set
down two days before the registration
was scheduled to start

  the freight carriers detailed to handle
the outfit did not make a landing but
only hovered over the park and let the
paraphernalia down with long cables
evidently they felt a landing would be
unsafe

  there was however no sign of dis-
turbance or attack and i immediately
broadcast my position and asked for a
conference with the mayor at the same
time i gave a brief explanation of my


amazing

stories

identity and why i was in the service
of the emperor

  i expressed the earnest hope that no
one would be so rash and foolhardy as
to resist the will of the race who be-
cause of their superior mechanical abil-
ity were undeniably in a position of
dominance

  i ended by reading the brief proclama-
tion issued by the emperor -egarding
reprisals in case i was molested or my
work interfered with

  the mayor came in obedience to my
call and reported that arrangements for
the registration were well under way
and the hundred thousand quota would
be ready for the first day he also
agreed to provide two hundred police to
handle the great crowds and regulate
their coming to the machines

  his feeling against the cudors was
very bitter but he agreed with me that
so long as there was no reasonable
chance for successful resistance we
might as well accept the inevitable with
as good a grace as possible

the early morning scene of the first
registration was one never to be for-
gotten

  high overhead was our control ship
ready to broadcast the power that was
to operate our fifty marking machines
or rather one great machine composed
of fifty units having holes for fifty
arms

  the great park was packed full of
humanity as far as i could see while
close at hand were rows on rows of in-
dividuals lined up in single file ready
for the beginning of the operation which
was to mark them as the slaves of the
emperor

  the people in the lines were of all
ages conditions and descriptions there
were old bent men and women men
in the prime of life and as many
children

the grown people seemed resentful
and sullen and most of them were
nervous and frightened but the chil-
dren for the most part were in a holiday
mood-full of laughter and good spirits
naturally they were unable to realize
what it was all abort this made it all
the more sickening to watch

  my eye fell upon one of the signs
which i had printed in english and
posted according to directions in a num-
ber of conspicuous places it read
persons having been fitted with iden-
tification rings are hereby forbidden to
remove them under any circumstances
any one over the specified age who is
found without a ring after the close
of this registration will be executed
and any person bearing such identifica-
tion found outside his majestys boun-
daries or attempting to pass through will
be similarly dealt with

  these rings are the property of the
emperor exclusively and must not be
defaced or tampered with

  all thoughts that any relations with
these cruel and despotic creatures can
lead to anything but servitude and degra-
dation faded from my mind

  i looked at the no  on my own
heavy ring and realized that i was only
a slave among slaves

and now the muffled roar of the
l machinery starts up signalling that
the days work is beginning the long
rows of victims step forward and in a
moment fifty cringing forms with arms
thrust into the machine holes and as
many small wreaths of smoke give evi-
dence that the painful process of num-
bering is going on according to schedule

  within the machine is heard a series
of loud clicks and the people at the
holes withdraw their arms they look at
the rings in pain and sorrow and pass
on to give room to those behind

  i turn away and go into my radio sta-
subjugating the earth



tion to report to the executive office that
his majestys registration is going for-
ward

     

of the particular time that this work
went on day after day each with
its hundred thousand markings there is
not much to tell each day was like
the last and each day the multitudes
that came seemed little different from the
ones of the day before i came to think
of people not so much as individuals as
in units of a hundred thousand of
great droves which came in the morn-
ing and were gone at night

  the machines worked perfectly and
tirelessly and each evening a supply of
material was let down by cable for the
next days operations

  every day i conferred with local
officials issued orders to local police re-
ported to the executive office-in fact
my work was such routine and so un-
eventful that it seemed as though i myself
was but a part of the mechanical equip-
ment moving in response to mechanical
laws

  at last the stream of humanity
dwindled and orders came for me to
prepare to move to the new york dis-
trict and enter the services of the em-
peror of new york

meanwhile the emperor of
chicago had caused a metal castle
to be erected on the shores of lake mich-
igan a few miles from the city and
announced that he would soon take up
his residence there and personally attend
to the ruling of his subjects he or-
dered ten men who had had experience
in teaching languages to be sent to the
castle to receive instruction in the cor-
dan language in preparation for becom-
ing translators and interpreters

  it took some four months to register
the inhabitants of the new york dis-

trict and from it i went to new or-
leans and finally to london and it was
here that i received the first news of
corn on the planetoid marazon

  for some time musical programs had
been coming through from the planetoid
and just before daylight in the morning
they were especially clear i had formed
the habit of setting my alarm clock
and waking up to hear them in the
hope of learning something of my old
comrade

  the programs had been largely instru-
mental with occasionally a vocal num-
ber on this particular occasion a tre-
mendously heavy typically cordan voice
had rendered a solo then i was thrilled
to hear a fine tenor voice-a voice that
was unmistakably human and very much
resembling the voice in which i remem-
bered having heard corn sing hill-
billy songs while we were in the wil-
derness

  at first the words were indistinct but
with a slight shift of the dials i was
able to bring them in clear and strong
the words were of course cordan as
was the announcement that followed

  you have been entertained by corn-
wallis recently made assistant musical
director of the department of educa-
tion

  so old corn was alive and carry-
ing on this was most gratifying news
i wished i could talk with him and
wondered if i should ever see him again
either on marazon or on this much
changed and disorganized world of ours

  not long after this i was surprised
to receive a summons to return to amer-
ica and to the new york district the
emperor of new york was to hold a
great coronation ceremony at which all
his subjects would be required to be
present and in honor of which the
planetoid marazon would actually visit
the earth

  it was to be my duty to arrange for


amazing stories

the building of a landing place and to
see to it that all of the more than ten mil-
lion inhabitants of the new york dis-
trict were gathered together at the
proper time

  i gathered-not from my instructions
but from snatches of broadcasts from
marazon-that due to the completion
of some sort of apparatus in the de-
velopment of which the foundation had
been particularly active the cordans
were now able to navigate their plane-
toid and make excursions outside their
regular orbit and the globe now per-
fectly balanced thanks to the supply of
magnetized metal brought from the core
of the earth by the foundation was able
to actually land and take off from other
planets

  so in recognition of the services of
the foundation the government had de-
cided to set aside the birthday of the
organizations senior director and make
it a holiday and the occasion for visiting
his earthly domain

the director in order to entertain
his guests and impress his subjects
had arranged the coronation program
the symbol of his authority was to be
a crown according to earthly custom
but not a crown of gold and precious
stones his crown was to be of nickel-
iron taken direct from the earths core
somewhat reminiscent of the iron crown
of the lombards

  on a large tract of especially level
farmland in the central part of the em-
pire state i set to work to prepare for
the eventful day full instruction charts
and blue prints had been provided by the
foundation

  first we had all farm buildings
groves and other obstructions removed
from several thousand acres and the
ground all cultivated and seeded to grass
only a railway and an automobile high-
way were left intact then a platform

of stone concrete and steel more than
an acre in extent was laid down and
so built that it was all locked together
in one solid mass with a row of great
steel rings anchored along one side

t he land lying on three sides of this
low platform was surveyed and
staked off into sections with avenues
between after the manner of a theatre
these sections were subdivided into a
million stations designed to afford stand-
ing room for one person and tagged with
a serial number those under a mil-
lion were in one section numbers from
three to four million in another and
so on markers were erected to indicate
to the crowds where to seek for their
numbers and each person was required
to proceed to the number corresponding
to the one on his identification ring and
take his station

  the fields at the back of the platform
were left vacant to accommodate the vast
bulk of the visiting asteroid

  there was much to be arranged to
provide transportation and temporary
camping quarters for all the people and
to make policing arrangements to avoid
delay and confusion while the multitude
were taking their positions



at last the eventful day dawns
and i feel confident that matters
have been well looked after
when a little after daylight i go out
to the grounds to await the arrival of
marazon

  i have had word from my superiors
that the asteroid is now hovering over
new york city and that after an hours
sight-seeing it will proceed to the land-
ing field

  mounted and foot police are already
on the ground directing the fast arriving
hordes of people and soon the stations
begin to fill up
subjugating the earth



  by the thousands and tens of thou-
sands by the millions they arrive until
the landscape is literally alive with them
they seem as numberless as the sands
of the sea but still they come i have
lately been accustomed to seeing great
crowds but this one surpasses by far
anything i have seen it is almost im-
possible to believe they are all human
beings

  at last the milling and hurrying about
subsides somewhat and inspectors are
seen going about making sure that all
are in their proper stations

  on the platform i take my place with
the mayor and his staff inside the blue
ring as indicated on the chart and the
two bands take up positions in the
proper squares all eyes are turned to-
ward the east

  binoculars and telescopes are much in
evidence for a little time nothing hap-
pens but now a great dim bulk appears
in the sky and of a sudden the sun is
blotted out causing a gloom like that
of an eclipse gradually the shadowy
shape becomes more distinct and looms
larger and larger but it continues to
mount higher and higher until the sun
presently appears beneath it and moving
with incredible speed it passes directly
over our heads at a great height while
we all hold our breath

  it comes to a wavering halt and be-
gins to settle toward us and now in the
full light of the sun details are visible

  it resembles an earth in miniature
a great globe miles and miles in diam-
eter with distinct land surfaces with
green fields interspersed with water areas
sparkling and shimmering in the sun-
light we make out cities the build-
ings of which even in the distance
appear tremendously tall and gigantic
and long stretches of forest and meadow
through which wind silvery rivers

  down down it comes until it touches
the ground with one great bulging side

protruding almost above our heads now
it rises a trifle and shifts this way and
that as though seeking a satisfactory
place to settle

  suddenly there is a great clanging
overhead and something comes tum-
bling down with a fearsome rush

  although i have tried to nerve my-
self for a rather trying experience i
cringe with those around me half ex-
pecting the great thing whatever it is
to fall upon me

  but it proves to be merely a series
of parralel slats bound together with
several lines of gigantic chain the
end hangs a little way from the ground
and close to the side of our platform

  the great asteroid moves a little this
way and that and the contrivance which
i now recognize as a gang plank swings
against the side of the platform there
is a series of clangs as a number of
heavy grapplers engage with the plat-
forms great rings

  the asteroid lifts free of the ground
and withdraws to some distance roll-
ing as it does so until the gangway is at
an angle of about thirty degrees from
the ground and its distant terminus sev-
eral miles away it reminds me of a
long suspension bridge i marvel at its
tremendous strength and ability to span
such a wide space

  with our glasses we can make out
great activity on the planetoid and pres-
ently we see a procession forming on
the runway we can see on the asteroid
vast series of grandstands crowded with
cordus

  the procession is made up of a great
many cars all elaborately decorated and
it comes on very quickly in the lead
are two or three low cars loaded with
guards armed with polished weapons
then two cars with bands of musicians
followed by the emperor himself riding
in great state with his attendants in a
black and gold car


amazing stories

  a dozen other cars are following and
overhead are several air craft flying low
and armed no doubt with magnetizing
operators and otherwise provided for
any eventuality but they are of little
interest to me i strain my eyes to see
if com is with the musicians

  there is what seems to resemble a
human form in the front car-yes it is 
a man in blue and gold uniform

  i strive for a better focus of my glass
yes it is really he good old corn
himself standing up trim as a ramrod
holding a white baton and directing the
playing of some unfamiliar but very stir-
ring selection the strains of which still
sound very far away

re at god i hear the mayor
vjf beside me ejaculate is that thing
going to be our emperor but i am
too interested too elated at seeing my
old friend again to make reply

  but all around me and out over the
great crowd i hear gasps of astonish-
ment and incredulity as the procession
draws near enough to reveal the gro-
tesque shapes of the emperor and the
other cudors

  the leading cars roll down upon the
platform and the guards take their
places on the red circle the bands still
playing pass to their respective places
blue crosses on the concrete

  the emperors own car comes to a
halt in the center of the platform

  the attendants put out folding cur-
tains and let down steps and while other
cars are gathered in the background
the conveyance is converted into a cor-
onation platform of great splendor

  the emperor stands erect and scans
the great silent crowd with a glass held
first to one and then the other of his
two smaller eyes and looks intently at
those on the platform with his single
great orb all his arms except the one
holding the glass hang idle against the

rigid stem of his tall trunk the tubby
and ungainly lower part of his body
supported by its four short legs seems
almost like some separate creature serv-
ing merely as a conveyance for the tall
trunk and head

  at the unfurling of a banner above
the emperor a prearranged signal
the mayor and his group including my-
self advance to the border of our ring
on the floor and hold up our arms dis-
playing the rings on our wrists at the
same moment each one of the assembled
multitude holds up a hand and presents
a number while our two bands strike
up a thunderous din

  the emperor disregarding us all
turns toward the asteroid and salutes
stiffly on the asteroid a great commo-
tion of loud noises and waving of ban-
ners is set up

  now comes a small cudor bearing
the glittering crown on a green cushion
he is followed by a tall individual wear-
ing many long streamers of ribbon his
gait and manner suggest that he is a
high priest as he approaches the em-
peror he is followed by dignitaries walk-
ing in solemn procession but appearing
very grotesque to us

  after an exchange of ceremonious and
impressive gestures during which we be-
come unconscious of their ungainly
shapes the emperor drops to a sitting
posture and the priest with great pomp
and elaborate gesture places the shin-
ing nickel-iron crown on his head

  there is a great flourish of noise from
the asteroid and we all hold up our
hands as before

  then from a closed car a man appears
bearing a huge megaphone evidently he
is an interpreter for the emperor for he
takes his place beside him

  the emperor begins to speak

  in assuming the duties and privileges
of emperor of new york  it is my
subjugating the earth



purpose to inaugurate a number of re-
forms   

  i am in no mood to listen to the
speech and i look around for corn
he is standing beside one of the band
cars and beckoning to me

  at the imminent risk of committing
a grave offense i step behind the mayor
and his cabinet and hurry around be-
hind the car where corn greets me with
a hearty hand-shake

  glad to see you still alive old man
he says even if the old world does
seem to be in a hell of a mess im in
luck he announced im going to stay
a week got a vacation in considera-
tion of services rendered and am off
duty at the end of this performance

then before i had time to con-
gratulate him he glanced cautiously
around and commenced to speak rapidly
in a much lower tone

  i have discovered the secret of this
gravity business and i have concocted
a scheme that i think is going to knock
these damned cordus into a cocked hat

  they are navigating their asteroid
by power from what seems like a giant
storage battery its two miles long
and half as wide it produces power
something like cosmic rays and affects
magnetism and gravitation the big
tank is full of combustible gas

  in the night i made a hole in the
tank by taking out a bolt then i stole
a long coil of fuse and stuck one end
through the hole and lit the other i
figure the fire ought to reach the gas
before noon watch out for something
big

  i saw the emperor had stopped speak-
ing and hurried back to my place hoping

i	was unobserved

after a little more ceremony the in-

	terpreter reads a brief proclamation
and the emperor prepares to leave

  all stand stiffly at attention as the
cars pass back over the long runway
anad gather speed it has been de-
creed that none of the subjects may
leave their positions until the asteroid
is gone

  there is a far-away roar of machin-
ery and the runway is quickly rolled up
while the great ball lifts slowly from the
ground

  then of a sudden there is a blinding
flash of light and a puff of black smoke
far above the grand stands on the aste-
roid and covering a wide area followed
a moment later by a tremendous crash
and i am bowled over as if by a sudden
blow



as consciousness returned i was
aware of a roaring and gushing
sound in my brain as though a stream
of thought were pouring into my
emptied mind

  this presently gave way to the sound
of voices at first seemingly far away
and indistinct then close at hand and
understandable

  after two or three unsuccessful at-
tempts to open my eyes i succeeded in
raising their heavy lids and sat up to
see people all about me-and straight in
front of me the great asteroid

  then i remembered what had hap-
pened the shock of the explosion the
sensation of -toppling over the sudden
darkness

  at that moment a group of people a
few yards away commenced to point
and gesticulate wildly and someone
shouted look look its coming
down

  indeed the great globe was unmistak-
ably settling jerkily earthward

  as my head cleared i remembered
corn where is corn i asked look-
ing about every one was too excited
to pay me any attention


amazing stories

  struggling up on my knees i plucked
a man by the sleeve and shouted where
is corn-the bandmaster-mr corn-
wallis 

  withdrawing his attention reluctantly
and only momentarily from the asteroid
he pointed to some one lying on the
ground at a little distance and half
hidden by those around him

  help me to him i begged trying
to get on my shaky legs

  wait he demanded impatiently
wait

  but somebody-i have no idea who-
put out a hand to steady me and in a
moment i was beside my friend who

i	now perceived was only one of num-
bers lying here and there being min-
istered to by those about them

  a doctor was just leaving corn and
as i came up he turned to me saying
hes terribly injured falling on the
staple and ring have caused complica-
tions but he will probably regain con-
sciousness temporarily at least

  as i sank on my knees beside him
corn moved convulsively and opened
his eyes and after a moment fixed
them on the asteroid then he looked
questioningly at me

  its coming down i said

  please put something behind me
said corn i want to see it some
one obliged with a piece of broken
chair and an overcoat

  a stretcher was set down beside him
dont bother me directed corn wav-
ing it away impatiently i want to see
whats doing this is my show

  binoculars he demanded holding
out his hand to me fortunately mine
were still on their strap and i put them
into his hand

  he held them to his eyes a moment
then lowering them looked at his other
hand inquiringly and appealingly but
there was no response it refused to
move

 t hastened to help him adjust and
 hold the glasses but after a moment

 he gave it up

   they blur he said rubbing his
 eyes you look-and-tell-me

its coming down corn old man

 i	said its almost to the ground

   near the top there is a great smok-
 ing crater that looks like a smoldering
 volcano

   -where the exploded tank was he
 put in with evident satisfaction

   i	went on i can see buildings in
 ruins and fires in a great many places
 and people-cudors - hurrying madly
 about

   there arc big cars that look like
 fire engines and all sorts of cars tear-
 ing about everywhere and a great many
 one-man machines are taking to the air
 there is a perfect swarm of them now
 its going to hit the ground their
 gravity machinery must be dead-

   a heavy jar shook the earth like an
 earthquake a roar went up from the
 assembled crowds

    corn started a little

   whats it doing now i cant see
 it he put his hand over his eyes

   everything is falling off i found
 myself shouting excitedly a perfect
 shower of buildings-machines-every-
 thing-tumbling to earth

   thats good-oh thats good com
 broke in i wonder what they think
 of subjugating the earth now

   its starting to go to pieces i de-
 clared the ground is falling away
 all the way round 

   yes i hear it falling he exclaimed
 but-its getting dark the darkness
 was only his failing sight

dont strain your eyes trying to see

 i	admonished hastily i will tell you
 all i see

 now the whole outside is coming
 crashing down its changing color the
 black and green are all gone and the
subjugating the earth



whole thing is a mass of gray stone
avalanches

  tts assuming a peaked shape like
a mountain with its slopes all in motion
and with clouds of white dust all about

  at that moment the spectators who
had been holding their breath in won-
der and suspense broke into a great
shout commencing in the near by sec-
tions and taken up gradually by those
farther and farther away until it seemed
to swell from the entire universe a
shout that was half a cry of joy and re-
lief and half a victorious howl of venge-
ance

  thats a glorious sound said corn
its worth all it cost   i m    im
glad i heard it before-before going
out   do you think its all destroyed
his head sank back and he closed his
eyes as though falling asleep

  just then mr adams the master of
ceremonies hurried up

  please make an announcement i
requested urgently say that the de-
struction of the enemy was brought
about by a time fuse set to blow up
their gas reservoir by mr cornwallis
who is lying here severely perhaps fa-
tally wounded    details later

in a moment i heard the voice of the
announcer coming from the many
amplifiers far and near complying with
my directions and when he had been
heard another vast roar arose from the
various portions of the huge assembly
which seemed to echo back and forth
across the landscape finally merging in
one continuous sound

  what do they say  asked corn
faintly opening his eyes once more

  i had thought he was gone

  they are cheering for you corn i
said in a voice that was choked with
emotion you are the hero of all the
ages

  well i suppose i was lucky enough

to get something worth while started
he said with a trace of his old smile   
have you got a cigarette about you

  i hastily lit one and put it in the hand
weakly held out to receive it but even
as he started to put it to his lips his
strength seemed to leave him his hand
fell his head sank back and a deathlike
pallor overspread his features

  the doctor who wras just returning
stooped and removed the lighted ciga-
rette from the limp fingers i was
afraid of it he said he is gone

	    

tt might have been supposed that in

	spite of the total destruction of their
planetoid some of the cudors-a few
at least-would have survived but des-
tiny ruled that it should be otherwise

  in the midst of the disintegration of
the asteroid it was noticed that in spite
of the fact that the source of their
power was destroyed none of the air-
craft maneuvering aloft were attempt-
ing to land but one by one they were
coming hurtling down out of the sky
to dash themselves and their occupants
to fragments on the ground and the
small one-man machines which had risen
in such numbers after the explosion only
milled about above the great wreck like
bees over a hive until scorning to fly
away they fell back into the wreckage

  so too the flyers who were on the
way to or from the arctic mines or in
other remote localities-upon being ad-
vised by radio of what was taking place
at home they evidently refrained from
landing as was their wont when any
mechanical difficulty developed and
stayed aloft as long as possible then
they came crashing down to death and
destruction

  as for the mining colony in the arc-
tic when an expedition reached there
several weeks later they were all dead
the great shafts were filled up the ma-


amazing stories

chinery destroyed and the operators
all gathered in one of the caverns had
died from inhaling some sort of lethal
gas

  whether all these flyers and workers
had been prompted to destroy themselves
by a fear of retribution on their being
taken prisoners or whether they rea-
soned that since their planetoid and their
whole civilization was gone life could
no longer be worth while will perhaps
always remain a mystery

  at any rate the race was as extinct
as the woolly rhinoceros and though
the mountainous ruins of their planetoid
were delved into by industrious investi-
gators little of their culture or science
could be brought to light

  as for the great fences they were
speedily torn down indeed their de-
struction was made the occasion for a
series of great celebrations only one
was permitted to remain standing the
first one built in the chicago district
and this was preserved as a monument
only a part of the inscription being
changed

  one passing now sees the legend

 erected by the first em-
 peror of chicago and
 preserved by a rescued
 world in commemora-
 tion of the heroism of
 their deliverer william
 howard cornwallis

the qhoice

by ralph maughan

no one would have recognized dr
harley in the pale wide-eyed
man who tore open the door
of the taxi and leapt to the curb com-
posed and unruffled the eminent physi-
cian was accustomed to fight death daily
by a score of bedsides his quiet capa-
bility had communicated itself to thou-
sands of the sick and dying soothing
their panic giving them the will to live
but dr harley was now discovering
that it was different when the dying
man was your only son

  this time he was helpless he who
had so often given his skill to free so
many from the very grasp of death
was now powerless to save the one be-
ing whose life meant more to him than
his own life he could do nothing for
the son who was to carry on his work
his only hope lay in his oldest friend
robert bennett

  thirty-two years before harley and
bennett had graduated together from
medical school harley to take up a prac-
tice and achieve well-deserved fame but
robert bennett hid himself away from
the world in his laboratory and for
thirty-two years had ruthlessly spent his
private fortune and his failing health
ceaselessly driving a frail body as he
groped his way toward the discovery of
a serum which would cure the dread dis-
ease known as meningitis

  for several weeks harley had known
that his old friend had been working
feverishly night and day on what
after years of heartbreaking disappoint-
ment he believed to be the right track
only two nights ago bennett had said

to him quietly allan im practically
certain that at last ive got it-and-
its about time

 harley knew what his friend had
meant when he said it was about time
and he was too wise to protest as
physicians they both knew that bennetts
heart could not long survive the pace
at which it was being driven

  and then only the night before
young allan had retired early with a
raging headache this morning he had
been found in semi-conscious torture
for one of harleys skill the diagnosis
was easy for all the doctors in the
world the cure was impossible

  he knew how it had happened young
allan had been accustomed to spend
many of his leisure hours in his uncle
roberts laboratory helping where he
could and always watching the progress
of the experiments with absorbed in-
terest there had been many cultures
in the laboratory innocent-looking little
glass tubes alive with the deadly men-
ingitis germ which robert bennett had
segregated and now harley knew that
his son was dying unless-

  breathlessly harley ran up the steps
of his friends house and let himself
in at the door in a numb agony of fore-
lorn hope he made his way back to the
laboratory there were still a few hours
would robert bennetts work of thirty-
two years have been finished in time
there was just a chance and on that
slender chance depended his sons life

  bursting into the laboratory harley
found himself confronted face to face
by his friend benrett was holding a


amazing

stories

test tube half filled with a perfectly
colorless liquid very carefully and
with a hand that shook almost uncontrol-
lably he set it down in a rack on the
desk in front of him

  there it is allan he whispered ex-
ultantly finished-finished- and

before harleys eyes with a spasm of
pain convulsing his features bennett
collapsed in a heap on the floor

  in an instant harley was beside him
unbuttoning his friends shirt and waist-
coat the eyes opened and sought har-
leys urgently

  the formula allan whispered ben-
nett so faintly that harley could
scarcely distinguish the words -the
formula quick-write it down it is
-it is-

  with a sharp intake of breath the
whisper ceased and the eyes closed
again it did not take harley long to
confirm what he already knew to be
true robert bennett was dead in the
hour of his triumph the overworked
heart which had been driven through
years of unremitting labor had failed to
survive the shock of victory the climax
of a life of self-sacrificing toil to confer
a lasting benefit on mankind

  slowly dr harley rose to his feet
and stared dazedly at the still form of
robert bennett-at the little half-filled
test tube on the desk it was only very
gradually as his mind cleared by de-
grees that the awful truth of what he
faced was revealed to him

  the formula for the prccious sub-
stance that would in the course of years
miraculously reprieve thousands and

thousands of sufferers from a hideous
death-that formula lay mute locked
in a dead mans brain but the con-
tents of that little test tube might be
analyzed recorded reproduced at will
and in any quantity for the benefit of
this generation and those to come it
would be a task that any expert chem-
ist could perform in a few days

  in a few days in a few hours the
raging disease would have burnt its
course through his sons pain-wracked
body harley knew the consequences to
expect there was never a recovery
nine chances out of ten the result was
death in agony the tenth chance-
harley shuddered at the thought-was
that his son would be a gibbering imbecile
for life the disease seared out the
brain even in those rare cases wrhere it
did not mercifully take life there on
the desk in those few drops of clear
liquid lay life and sanity for his son
the boy who was destined to follow after
harley and as a physician serve hu-
manity in his turn

  in one dreadful moment harley act-
ually wished that his son were already
dead that he might be spared a deci-
sion which was too much to ask of any
man but he knew that there were
still a few hours he must decide

  for many minutes harley stood mo-
tionless staring with unseeing eyes
then very deliberately he picked the
little test tube out of its rack put a
stopper in it wrapped it in his pocket
handkerchief and walked slowly out
of the room but as he left he care-
fully avoided looking on the peaceful
face of his dead friend

cjyceasuring a meridian

serial in three parts-part ii
by jules verne

 we have had what may be termed a scientific introduction to one of the
 great cosmic measurements measuring the circumference of the earth a
 veritable achievement the work of the scientists goes on and the descrip-
 tions of scenery and life in the wilderness and of the great achievements
 of one of the party as a hunter carries us along through the second install-
 ment and we read of the declaration of war between russia and england
 which causes a short division in the party

illustrated by morey

what went before

 a party of scientists some russian and some english near the time of the crimean war
 go to africa to measure on its extended plains a segment of the circumference of the
 earth in order to determine its true circumference some of the party are at the
 beginning of the line to be measured and are awaiting the arrival of a steamboat carrying
 much of their equipment which at last comes up the river the boat is made to be knocked
 down so that it can be put in pieces upon ox wagons and be taken from place to place
 we are told of the different attempts to measure a meridian the details of which are of much
 interest as presented by our author especially does he mention the meridian from the balearic
 islands to dunkirk on the british channel this we are told is especially interesting because
 its termini are so located that the slight departure of the earth from true sphericity is auto-
 matically corrected the methods and history of the different attempts to establish a standard
 meter based on the measurement of a meridian are described coming back to our story
 the party starts off to take their measurements and do their triangulations one of the party
 is a great hunter and we are told of his successes among the great forms of african game and
 we are to hear more about it in the later part of the story so at last alter the details of this
 first installment and which are of great scientific as well as narrative interest the party of
 english and russians start off on the work of measurement not on the best of terms with each
 other and with the crimean war impending

chapter viii

the twenty-fourth meridian

 the measurement of the base oc-
 cupied thirty-eight days from
 the th of march to the th of
 april and without loss of time the chiefs
 decided to begin the triangles the first
 operation was to find the southern ex-
 tremity of the arc and the same being
 done at the northern extremity the dif-
 ference would give the number of de-
 grees measured

on the th they began to find their

latitude emery and zorn had already
on the preceding nights taken the altitude
of numerous stars and their work was
so accurate that the greatest error was
not more than  and even this was
probably owing to the refraction caused
by the changes in the atmospheric strata
the latitude thus carefully sought was
found to be  then they
found the longitude and marked the
spot on an excellent large scale map of
south africa which showed the most
recent geographical discoveries and also
the routes of travelers and naturalists
such as the missionary livingstone an-

 uttering plaintive cries
measuring a meridian



derson magyar baldwin butchell and
lichtenstein they then had to choose
on what meridian they would measure
their arc the longer this arc is the
less influence have the errors in the
determination of latitude the arc from
dunkirk to formentera on the meridian
of paris was exactly   they had
to choose their meridian with great cir-
cumspection any natural obstacles
such as mountains or large tracts of
water would seriously impede their
operations but happily this part of
africa seemed well suited to their re-
quirements since the risings in the
ground were inconsiderable and the few
watercourses easily traversed only dan-
gers and not obstacles need check their
labors

  this district is occupied by the kal-
ahari desert a vast region extending
from the orange river to lake ngami
from lat  s to lat  s in width
it extends from the atlantic on the west
as far as long  e dr livingstone
followed its extreme eastern boundary
when he traveled as far as lake ngami
and the zambesi falls properly speak-
ing it does not deserve the name of
desert it is not like the sands of the
sahara which are devoid of vegeta-
tion and almost impassable on account
of their aridity the kalahari produces
many plants its soil is covered with
abundant grass it contains dense groves
and forests animals abound wild game
and beasts of prey and it is inhabited
and traversed by sedentary and wander-
ing tribes of bushmen and bakalaharis
but the true obstacle to its exploration
is the dearth of water which prevails
through the greater part of the year
when rivers are dried up however
at this time just at the end of the rainy
season they could depend upon consid-
erable reservoirs of stagnant water pre-

 	formcntcta is one of the balearic islands in the
 mediterranean south of spain

served in pools and rivulets such were
the particulars given by mokoum he
had often visited the kalahari some-
times on his own account as a hunter
and sometimes as a guide to some geo-
graphical exploration

  it had now to be actually considered
whether the meridian should be taken
from one of the extremities of the base
thus avoiding a series of auxiliary tri-
angles

  after some discussion it was decided
that the southern extremity of the base
would serve for a starting-point it was
the twenty-fourth meridian east from
greenwich and extended over seven de-
grees of latitude from  to  with-
out any apparent natural obstacle to-
ward the north it certainly crossed the
eastern end of lake ngami but arago
had met with greater difficulties than this
when he applied his geodesy to connect
the coast of spain with the balearic
islands it was accordingly decided that
meridian  should be measured since
if it were afterward prolonged into
europe a northern arc of the same mer-
idian might be measured on russian
territory

  the astronomers proceeded at once to
choose a station which should form the
vertex of the first triangle this was a
solitary tree to the right of the mer-
idian standing on a mound about ten
miles away it was distinctly visible
from each extremity of the base and its
slender top facilitated the taking of its
bearings the angle made by the tree
with the southeast extremity of the
base was first observed with the help
of one of bordas repeating circles

  the two telescopes were adjusted so
that their axes were exactly in the plane
of the circle in such a way that their
position represented the angular dis-
tance between the tree and the north-
west extremity of the base this ad-
mirably-constructed instrument corrects


amazing stories

nearly all the errors of observation and
indeed if the repetitions are numerous
the errors tend to counterbalance and
correct each other

  the commission had four repeating
circles two for measuring angles and
two more with vertical circles for ob-
taining zenith distances and so cal-
culating in a single night to the smallest
fraction of a second the latitude of any
station and indeed in this important
survey it was not only necessary to ob-
tain the value of the angles of the tri-
angles but also to measure the meridian
altitude of the stars that giving the lati-
tude of each station

  the work began on the th of april
colonel everest zorn and palander
observed the angle at the southeast ex-
tremity of the base while strux emery
and sir john murray observed that at
the northwest extremity

  meantime the camp was raised and
the bullocks harnessed and mokoum
conducted the caravan to the first sta-
tion as a halting place two caravans
with their drivers accompanied the ob-
servers to carry the instalments the
weather was bright but had the atmos-
phere been unfavorable by day the
observations would have been made by
night by means of reflectors or elec-
tric lamps

  on the first day the two angles were
measured and the result inscribed on
the double register and the astronomers
all met in the evening at the camp
which had been formed round the tree
which had served for their point of sight
it was an immense baobab more than
 feet in circumference its syenite-
colored bark gave it a peculiar appear-
ance the whole caravan found room
beneath its wide branches which were
inhabited by crowds of squirrels which
greedily devoured the white pulp of its
egg-shaped fruit

  supper was prepared for the euro-

peans by the ships cook there was no
lack of venison for the hunters had
scoured the neighborhood and killed
some antelopes and soon the air was
filled with an odor of broiled meat
which still further aroused the appetite
of the hungry savants

  after the comforting repast the
astronomers retired to their respective
wagons whilst mokoum placed sentinels
round the camp large fires of the dead
branches of the baobab burnt through-
out the night and kept at a respectful
distance the tawny beasts who were
attracted by the odor of the reeking flesh

  after two hours sleep however em-
ery and zorn got up their observations
not yet finished they must find the
altitudes of some stars to determine the
latitude of the station and both regard-
less of the days fatigue stood at their
telescopes and rigorously determined the
change of zenith caused by the re
moval from the first station to the sec-
ond while the laugh of the hyena and
the roar of the lion resounded over the
somber plain

chapter ix

a kraal

the next day operations were con-
tinued the angle made by the
baobab with the extremities of the
base was measured and the first triangle
solved two more stations were chosen
to the right and left of the meridian one
formed by a distinct mound six miles
away the other marked out by a post
about seven miles distant

  the triangulation went on uninter-
ruptedly for a month and by the th
of may the observers had advanced
northward  having formed seven
triangles during this first series of op-
erations the colonel and strux were
rarely together the division of labor
measuring a meridian



separated them and the circumstance of
their daily work being several miles apart
was a guarantee against any dispute each
evening they returned to their several
abodes and although at intervals discus-
sions arose about the choice of stations
there was no serious altercation hence
zorn and his friend were in hopes that
the survey would proceed without any
open rupture

  after advancing  from the south
the observers found themselves in the
same parallel with lattakoo from which
they were distant  miles to the west

  here a large kraal had lately been
formed and as it was a marked halting-
place sir john murray proposed that
they should stay for several days zorn
and emery could take advantage of the
rest to take the altitude of the sun and
palander would employ himself in reduc-
ing the measurements made at different
points of sight to the uniform level of
the sea sir john himself wanted to be
free from scientific observations that he
might divert himself with his gun among
the fauna of the country a kraal as
it is termed by the natives of south
africa is a kind of moving village wan-
dering from one pasturage to another
it is an enclosure comprising ordinarily
about thirty habitations and containing
several hundred inhabitants the kraal
now reached was formed by a group of
more than sixty huts enclosed for pro-
tection from wild animals by a palisade
of prickly aloes and situated on the
banks of a small affluent of the kuru-
man the huts made of water-proof
rush mats fastened to wooden beams
were like low hives the doorway pro-
tected by a skin was so small that it
could only be entered on hands and knees
and from this the only aperture issued
such dense wreaths of smoke as would
make existence in these abodes proble-
matical to any but a bochjesman or a
hottentot

   the whole population was roused by
the arrival of the caravan the dogs of
which there was one for the protection
of each cabin barked furiously and about
 warriors armed with assagais knives
and clubs and protected by their leathern
shields marched forward

   a few words from mokoum to one of
the chiefs soon dispelled all hostile feel-
ing and the caravan obtained permis-
sion to encamp on the very bank of the
stream the bochjesmen did not even
refuse permission to share the pastures
which extended for miles away

   mokoum having first given orders for
 the wagons to be placed in a circle as
 usual mounted his zebra and set off in
 company with sir john murray who
 rode his accustomed horse the hunters
 took their dogs and rifles showing their
 intention of attacking the wild beasts
 and went toward the woods

  i hope mokoum sgid sir john
that you are going to keep the promise
you made at the morgheda falls that
you would bring me into the best sport-
ing country in the world but under-
stand i have not come here for hares
and foxes i can get them at home be-
fore another hour-

   hour replied the bushman you
are rather too fast a little patience
please for myself i am never patient
except when hunting and then i make
amends for all my impatience at other
times dont you know sir john that
the chase of large beasts is quite a science
here you must watch and wait you
must not step or even look too quickly
for my part i have lain in wait for dys
together for a buffalo or gems-bok and
if i have had success at last i have not
considered my trouble in vain

   very good replied sir john i can
 show you as much patience as you can
 wish but mind the halt only lasts for
 three or four days and we must lose
 no time


amazing stories

  there is something in that said the
bushman so calmly that emery would
not have recognized his companion of the
orange river we will just kill that
which comes first sir john antelope or
deer gnu or gazelle anything must do
for hunters in a hurry

  antelope or gazelle cried sir john
why what more could i ask my good
fellow 

  as long as your honor is satisfied i
have nothing more to say said the bush-
man somewhat ironically i thought
that you would not let me off with any-
thing less than a rhinoceros or two or
at least an elephant

  anything and anywhere said sir
john we only waste time in talking

  the steeds were put to a hand-gallop
and the hunters advanced quickly toward
the forest the plain rose with a gentle
slope towards the northeast it was dotted
here and there with shrubs in full bloom
from which isued a viscous resin trans-
parent and odorous of which the colon-
ists make a balm for wounds in pic-
turesque groups rose the nwanas a
kind of sycamore fig whose trunks leaf-
less to the height of  or  feet sup-
ported a spreading parasol of verdure
among the foliage chattered swarms of
screaming parrots eagerly pecking the
sour figs farther on were mimosas with
their yellow clusters silver trees shak-
ing their silky tufts and aloes with spikes
so red that they might pass for coral
plants torn from the depths of the sea
the ground enameled with amaryllis with
their bluish foliage was smooth and easy
for the horses and in less than an hour
after leaving the kraal the sportsmen
reached the woods for several miles ex-
tended a forest of acacias the entangled
branches scarcely allowing a ray of sun-
light to penetrate to the ground below
which was encumbered by brambles and
long grass

   the hunters had little difficulty how-

ever in urging on both horse and zebra

in spite of every obstacle resting at the
recurring glades to examine the thickets
around them the first day was not very
favorable in vain was the forest
scoured not a single beast stirred and
sir johns thoughts turned more than
once to the plains of scotland where a
shot is rarely long delayed mokoum
evinced neither surprise nor vexation to
him it was not a hunt but merely a rush
across the forest

  towards six in the evening they had
to think about returning sir john was
more vexed than he would allow rather
than that he the renowned hunter should
return empty-handed he resolved to shoot
whatever first came within range and
fortune seemed to favor him

  they were not more than three miles
from kraal when a hare of the species
called lepus rupestris darted from a
bush about  paces in front of them
sir john did not hesitate a moment and
sent his explosive ball after the poor lit-
tle animal

  the bushman gave a cry of indigna-
tion at such a ball being employed for
such an aim but the englishman eager
for his prey galloped to the spot where
the victim fell in vain the only vestiges
of the hare were the bloody morsels on
the ground whilst the dogs rummaged
in the brush-wood sir john looked keen-
ly about and cried

  i am sure i hit it

  rather too well replied the bush-
man quietly

  and sure enough the hare had been
blown into fragments

  sir john greatly mortified remounted
his horse and returned to camp without
uttering another word

  the next day the bushman waited for
sir john murray to propose another ex-
pedition  but the englishman applied
himself for a time to his scientific in-
struments for pastime he watched the
measuring a meridian



occupants of the kraal as they practiced
with their bows or played on the gorah
an instrument composed of a piece of
catgut stretched on a bow and kept in
vibration by blowing through an ostrich
feather he remarked that the women
while occupied in their domestic duties
smoked matokouane that is the un-
wholesome hemp-plant a practice in-
dulged in by most of the natives ac-
cording to some travelers this inhaling
of hemp increases physical strength to
the damage of mental energy and in-
deed many of the bochjesmen appeared
stupefied from its effects

  at dawn however the following day
sir john murray was aroused by the ap-
pearance of mokoum who said i think
sir we may be fortunate enough today
to find something better than a hare

  sir john not heeding the satire de-
clared himself ready and the two hunt-
ers accordingly were off betimes this
time sir john instead of his formidable
rifle carried a simple gun of goldwins
as being a more suitable weapon true
there was a chance of meeting some
prowling beast from the forest but he
had the hare on his mind and would
sooner use small shot against a lion than
repeat an incident unprecedented in the
annals of sport

  fortune to-day was more favorable to
the hunters they brought down a cou-
ple of harrisbucks a rare kind of black
antelope very difficult to shoot these
were charming animals four feet high
with long diverging horns shaped like
scimitars the tips of their noses were
narrow they had black hoofs close soft
hair and pointed ears their face and
belly white as snow contrasted well with
their black back over which fell a wavy
mane hunters may be proud of such
shots for the harrisbuck has always been
the desideratum of the delegorgues
vahlbergs cummings and baldwins and
it is one of the finest specimens of the

southern fauna of the african continent

  but what made the englishmans heart
beat fastest was mokoums showing him
certain marks on the edge of the thick
underwood not far from a deep pool
surrounded by giant euphorbias and
whose surface was dotted with skyblue
water-lilies

  come and lie in ambush here to-mor-
row sir said mokoum and this time
you may bring your rifle look at these
fresh footprints

  what are they  can they be an ele-
phants asked sir john

  yes replied mokoum and unless
i am mistaken of a male full-grown

  eagerly then was the engagement
made for the following day sir johns
horse as they returned carried the harris-
bucks these fine creatures so rarely
captured excited the admiration of the
whole caravan and all congratulated sir
john except perhaps matthew strux
who knew little of animals except the
great bear the centaur pegasus and
other celestial fauna

  at four oclock the next morning the
hunters attended by their dogs were al-
ready hidden in the underwood they
had discovered by new footmarks that
the elephants came in a troop to drink
at the pool their grooved rifles carried
explosive bullets silent and still they
watched for about half-an-hour when
they observed a movement in the grove
about fifty paces from the pool sir
john seized his gun but the bushman
made him a sign to restrain his impa-
tience soon large shadows appeared the
thickets rustled under the violence of
some pressure the brushwood snapped
and crackled and the sound of loud
breathing was audible through the
branches it was the herd of elephants
half a dozen gigantic creatures almost
as large as those of india advanced slow-
ly toward the pool the increasing day-
light allowed sir john struck with ad-


amazing

stories

miration to notice especially a male of
enormous size his colossal proportions
appeared in the partial light even greater
than they really were while his trunk
was extended above the underwood with
his curved tusks he struck the great stems
which groaned under the shock the
bushman leant down close to sir johns
ear and whispered

  will he suit you

  sir john made a sign of affirmation
then said mokoum we will sepa-
rate him from the rest

  at this instant the elephants reached
the edge of the pool and their spongy
feet sank into the soft mud they
pumped up the water with their trunks
and poured it into their throats with a
loud gurgling the great male looked
uneasily about him and seemed to scent
some approaching danger

  suddenly the bushman gave a peculiar
cry the dogs barking furiously darted
from concealment and rushed toward the
herd at the same moment mokoum
charging his companion to remain where
he was went off on his zebra to inter-
cept the elephants retreat the animal
made no attempt to take flight and sir
john with his finger on the lock of his
rifle watched him closely the brute
beat the trees and lashed his tail furi-
ously showing signs not of uneasiness
but of anger now for the first time
catching sight of his enemy he rushed
upon him at once

  sir john was about sixty paces distant
and crackled and the sound of loud
forty paces he aimed at his flank and
fired but a movement of the horse
made his aim unsteady and the ball only
entered the soft flesh without meeting
any obstacle sufficient to make it ex-
plode

  the enraged beast increased its pace
which was rather a rapid walk than a
run and would have soon distanced the
horse sir johns horse reared and

rushed from the thicket his master un-
able to hold him in the elephant fol-
lowed ears erect and bellowing like a
trumpet sir john thus carried away
held on to his horse tightly with his knees
and endeavored to slip a cartridge into
the chamber of his rifle still the ele-
phant gained on him they were soon
beyond the wood and out on the plain
sir john vigorously used his spurs and
the two dogs rushed panting in the rear
the elephant was not two lengths be-
hind sir john could hear the hissing of
his trunk and almost feel his strong
breath every moment he expected to
be dragged from his saddle by the living
lasso all at once the horse sunk on his
hind-quarters struck by the elephant on
his haunches he neighed and sprung
to one side thus saving sir john the
elephant unable to check his course
passed on and sweeping the ground with
his trunk caught up one of the dogs
and shook it in the air with tremendous
violence no resource remained except
to re-enter the wood and the horses in-
stinct carried him thither the elephant
continued to give chase brandishing the
unlucky dog whose head he smashed
against a sycamore as he rushed into the
forest the horse darted into a dense
thicket entangled with prickly creepers
and stopped

  sir john torn and bleeding but not
for an instant discomposed turned round
and shouldering his rifle took aim at the
elephant close to the shoulder through
the net-work of creepers the ball ex-
ploded as it struck the bone the animal
staggered and almost at the same mo-
ment a second shot from the edge of the
wood struck his left flank he fell on
his knees near a little pool half hidden
in the grass there pumping up the
water with his trunk he began to wash
his wounds uttering plaintive cries the
bushman now appeared shouting he is
ours he is ours
measuring a meridian



  and in truth the animal was mortally
wounded he groaned piteously and
breathed hard his tail moved feebly
and his trunk fed from the pool of his
blood poured back a crimson stream on
the surrounding brushwood gradually
his strength failed and the great beast
was dead

  sir john murray now emerged from
the grove he was half naked little of
his hunting costume remaining but rags
but he felt as though he could have given
his very skin for this triumph

  a glorious fellow he exclaimed as
he examined the carcass but rather too
big to carry home

  true sir answered mokoum we
will cut him up on the spot and carry off
the choice parts look at his magnificent
tusks twenty-five pounds a piece at
least and ivory at five shilling a-pound
will mount up

  thus talking the hunter proceeded to
cut up the animal he took out the tusks
with his hatchet and contented himself
with the feet and trunk as choice mor-
sels with which to regale the members of
the commission this operation took
some time and he and his companion did
not get back to camp before midday the
bushman had the elephants feet cooked
according to the african method that is
burying them in a hole previously heated
like an oven with hot coals

  the delicacy was fully appreciated by
all not excepting the phlegmatic palan-
der and sir john murray received a
hearty round of compliments

chapter x

the rapids

during their sojourn by the
kraal colonel everest and mat-
thew strux had been absolutely
strangers on the eve of their departure

for their divided labors they had cere-

                  s

moniously taken leave one of the other
and had not since met the caravan
continued its northward route and the
weather being favorable during the next
ten days two fresh triangles were meas-
ured the vast verdant wilderness was
intersected by streams flowing between
rows of the willow-like karre-hout
from which the bochjesmen make their
bows large tracts of desert land oc-
curred where every trace of moisture
disappeared leaving the soil utterly bare
but for the cropping-up occasionally of
those mucilaginous plants which no arid-
ity can kill for miles there was no
natural object that could be used for a
station and consequently the astronom-
ers were obliged to erect artificial objects
for their point of sight this caused
considerable loss of time but was not
attended with much real difficulty the
crew of the queen and czar were em-
ployed in this part of the work and
performed their task well and rapidly
but the same jealousy that divided their
chiefs crept in sometimes among the
seamen zorn and emery did all they
could to neutralize any unpleasantness
but the discussions sometimes took a
serious character the colonel ancl strux
continually interfered in behalf of their
countrymen whether they were right or
wrong but they only succeeded in mak-
ing matters worse after a while zorn
and emery were the only members of
the party who had preserved a perfect
concord even sir john murray and
nicholas palander generally absorbed
as they were the one in his calculations
the other in his hunting began to join
the fray

  one day the dispute went so far that
strux said to the colonel you must
please to moderate your tone with
astronomers from poulkowa remember
it was their telescope that showed that
the disc of uranus is circular

  yes replied the colonel but ours

at cambridge enabled us to classify the
nebula of andromeda

  the irritation was evident and at
times seemed to imperil the fate of the
triangulation hitherto the discussions
had had no injurious effect but perhaps
rather served to keep every operation
more scrupulously exact

on the th the weather suddenly
changed in any other region a
storm and torrents of rain might have
been expected angry looking clouds cov-
ered the sky and lightning unaccom-
panied by thunder gleamed through the
mass of vapor but condensation did
not ensue-not a drop of rain fell upon
the thirsty soil the sky remained over-
cast for some days and the fog ren-
dered the points of sight invisible at
the distance of a mile the astronomers
however would not lose time and deter-
mined to set up lighted signals and work
at night the bushman prudently ad-
vised caution lest the electric lights
should attract the wild beasts too closely
to their quarters and in fact during
the night the yelp of the jackal and
the hoarse laugh of the hyena like that
of a drunken negro could plainly be
heard

  in the midst of this clamor in which
the roar of a lion could sometimes be
distinguished the astronomers felt rather
distracted and the measurements were
taken at least less rapidly if not less
accurately to take zenith distances
while gleaming eyes might be gazing at
them through the darkness required im-
perturbable composure and the utmost
sang-froid but these qualities were not
wanting in the members of the com-
mission and after a few days they re-
gained their presence of mind and
worked away in the midst of the beasts
as calmly as if they were in their own
observatories armed hunters attended
them at every station and no inconsider-

able number of hyenas fell by their balls
sir john thought this way of surveying
delightful and while his eye was at his
telescope his hand was on his gun and
more than once he made a shot in the
intervals between two observations

  nothing occurred to check the steady
progress of the survey so that the
astronomers hoped before the end of
june to measure a second degree of the
meridian on the th they found that
their path was crossed by an affluent of
the kuruman the europeans could
easily take their instruments across in
their india-rubber canoe but mokoum
would have to take the caravan to a
ford which he remembered some miles
below the river was about half a mile
wide and its rapid current broken here
and there by rocks and trunks of trees
embedded in the mud offered consider-
able danger to any light craft matthew
strux did not fail to represent this but
finding that his companions did not re-
coil from the attempt he gave way

  nicholas palander alone was to ac-
company the caravan in its detour he
was too much absorbed in his calcula-
tions to give any thought to danger but
his presence was not indispensable to
his companions and the boat would only
hold a limited number of passengers
accordingly he gave up his place to an
englishman of the crew of the queen
and czar who would be more useful
under the circumstances

  after making an arrangement to meet
to the north of the rapid the caravan
disappeared down the left bank of the
stream leaving colonel everest strux
emery zorn ir john two sailors and
a bochjesman who was the pioneer of
the caravan and had been recommended
by mokoum as having much experience
in african rapids

  a pretty river observed zorn to
his friend as the sailors were preparing
the boat
measuring a meridian



ery much so but hard to cross
answered emery these rapids
have not long to live and therefore enjoy
life with a few weeks of this dry
season there will hardly remain enough
of this swollen torrent to water a cara-
van it is soon exhausted such is the
law of nature moral and physical but
we must not waste time in moralizing
see the boat is equipped and i am all
anxiety to see her performances

 in a few minutes the boat was
launched beside a sloping bank of red
granite here sheltered by a project-
ing rock the water quietly bathed the
reeds and creepers the instruments
and provisions were put in the boat and
the passengers seated themselves so as
not to interfere with the action of the
paddles the bochjesman took the helm
he spoke but a few words of english
and advised the travelers to keep a pro-
found silence while they were crossing
the boat soon felt the influence of the
current the sailors carefully obeyed
every order of the bochjesman some-
times they had to raise their paddles to
avoid some half-emerged stump some-
times to row hard across a whirlpool
when the current became too strong
they could only guide the light boat as
it drifted with the stream the native
tiller in hand sat watchful and motion-
less prepared for every danger the
europeans were half uneasy at their
novel situation they seemed carried
away by an irresistible force the col-
onel and strux gazed at each other with-
out a word sir john with his rifle be-
tween his knees watched the numerous
birds that skimmed the water and the
two younger astronomers gazed with ad-
miration at the banks past which they
flew with dizzy speed the light boat
soon reached the true rapid which it
was necessary to cross obliquely at a
word from the bochjesman the sailors
put forth their strength but despite all

their efforts they were carried down
parallel to the banks the tiller and
paddles had no longer any effect and
the situation became really perilous a
rock or stump of a tree would inevitably
have overturned the boat in spite of
the manifest peril no one uttered a
word the bochjesman half rose and
watched the direction which he could not
control two hundred yards distant
rose an islet of stones and trees which
it was impossible to avoid in a few
seconds the boat apparently must be
lost but the shock came with less vio-
lence than had seemed inevitable the
boat lurched and shipped a little water
but the passengers kept their places
they were astonished to observe that
what they had presumed to be a rock
had moved and was plunging about in
the rush of the waters it was an im-
mense hippopotamus ten feet long which
had been carried by the current against
the islet and dared not venture out
again into the rapid feeling the shock
he raised and shook his head looking
about him with his strange dull eyes
and with his mouth wide open show-
ing his great canine teeth he rushed
furiously on the boat which he threat-
ened to bite to pieces

  but sir john murrays presence of
mind did not forsake him quietly
shouldering his rifle he fired at the ani-
mal near the ear the hippopotamus
did not quit his hold but shook the
boat as a dog would a hare a second
shot was soon lodged in his head the
blow was mortal after pushing the
boat with a last effort off the islet the
fleshy mass sank in the deep water be-
fore the dismayed voyagers could collect
their thoughts they were whirled
obliquely into the rapid a hundred
yards below a sharp bend in the river
broke the current thither was the boat
carried and was arrested by a violent
shock safe and sound the whole party

leaped to the bank they were about
two miles below the spot where they had
embarked

chapter xi

nicholas palandgr is lost and found

in continuing the survey the astron-
omers had to be on their guard
against the serpents that infested
the region venomous mambas ten to
twelve feet long whose bite would have
been fatal

  four days after the passage of the
rapid the observers found themselves in
a wooded country the trees however
were not so high as to interfere with
their labors and at all points rose
eminences which afforded excellent sites
for the posts and the electric lamps the
district lying considerably lower than
the rest of the plain was moist and
fertile emery noticed thousands of
hottentot fig-trees whose sour fruit is
much relished by the bochjesmen from
the ground arose a soft odor from the
kucumakranti a yellow fruit two or
three inches long growing from bulbous
roots like the colchicum and eagerly
devoured by the native children here
too in this more watered country reap-
peared the fields of colocynths and bor-
ders of the mint so successfully natural-
ized in england notwithstanding its
fertility the country appeared little fre-
quented by the wandering tribes and
not a kraal or a camp-fire was to be
seen yet water was abundant forming
some considerable streams and lagoons

  the astronomers halted to await the
caravan the time fixed by mokoum
had just expired and if he had reck-
oned well he would join them today
the day however passed on and no
bochjesman appeared sir john con-
jectured that the hunter had probably
been obliged to ford further south than

he had expected since the river was
unusually swollen another day passed
and the caravan had not appeared the
colonel became uneasy he could not
go on and the delay might affect the
success of the operations matthew strux
said that it had always been his wish to
accompany the caravan and that if his
advice had been followed they would
not have found themselves in his pre-
dicament but he would not admit that
the responsibility rested on the russians
colonel everest began to protest against
these insinuations but sir john inter-
posed saying that what was done could
not be undone and that all the recrimina-
tions in the world would make no differ-
ence

  it was then decided that if the caravan
did not appear on the following day
emery and zorn under theguidance of
the bochjesman should start to ascer-
tain the reason of the delay for the
rest of the day the rivals kept apart
and sir john passed his time in beating
the surrounding woods he failed in
finding any large game but from a nat-
uralists point of view he ought to have
been satisfied since he brought down
two fine specimens of african birds
one was a kind of partridge a francolin
thirteen inches long with short legs
dark gray back red beak and claws
and elegant wings shaded with brown
the other bird with a red throat and
white tail was a species of falcon the
bochjesman pioneer cleverly took off the
skins in order that they should be pre-
served entire

  the next day was half over and the
two young men were just about to start
on their search when a distant bark
arrested them soon mokoum on his
zebra emerged at full speed from the
thicket of aloes on the left and ad-
vanced toward the camp

  welcome cried sir john joyfully
we had almost given you up and apart
measuring a meridian



from you i should be inconsolable i
am only successful when you are with
me we will celebrate your return in
a glass of usquebaugh

  mokoum made no answer but anx-
iously scanned and counted the eu-
ropeans colonel everest perceived his
perplexity and as he was dismounting
said

  for whom are you looking mo-
koum 

  for mr palander replied the bush-
man

  is he not with you said the
colonel

  not now answered mokoum i
thought i should find him with you he
is lost

  at these words matthew strux step-
ped forward

  lost he said he was confided
to your care you are responsible for
his safety and it is not enough to say
he is lost

mokoums face flushed and he
answered impatiently

  why should you expect me to take
care of one who cant take care of him-
self why blame me if mr palander
is lost it is by his own folly twenty
times i have found him absorbed in his
figures and have brought him back to
the caravan but the evening before
last he disappeared and i have not seen
him since perhaps if you are so clever
yon can spy him out with your tele-
scope

  the bushman would doubtless have
become more irritable still if sir john
had not pacified him matthew strux
had not been able to get in a word but
now turned round unexpectedly to the
colonel saying

  i shall not abandon my countryman
i suppose that if mr john murray or
mr emery were lost you would sus-
pend operations and i dont see why

you should do less for a russian than
for an englishman

  mr strux cried the colonel fold-
ing his arms and fixing his eyes on his
adversary do you wish to insult me
why should you suppose that we will
not seek this blundering calculator
sir said strux

  yes blundering repeated the col-
onel and to return to what you said
i maintain that any embarrassment to
the progress of the operations from this
circumstance would be due to the rus-
sians alone

  colonel cried strux with gleaming
eyes your words- are hasty

  my words on the contrary are well
weighed let it be understood that
operations are suspended until mr pal-
ander is found are you ready to
start 

  i was ready before you spoke a
word answered strux sharply

  the caravan having now arrived the
disputants each went to his wagon on
the way sir john could not help saying
it is lucky that the stupid fellow
has not carried off the double register
just what i was thinking said the
colonel

  the englishmen proceeded more
strictly to interrogate mokoum he told
them that palander had been missing
for two days and had last been seen
alongside of the caravan about twelve
miles from the encampment that after
missing him he at once set out to seek
for him but being unsuccessful in all
his search had concluded that he must
have made his way to his companions

  mokoum proposed that they should
now explore the woods to the northeast
adding that they must not lose an hour
if they wanted to find him alive know-
ing that no one could wander with
impunity for two days in a country in-
fested like that with wild beasts where
anyone else could find a subsistence pal-


amazing stories

ander ever engrossed by his figures
would inevitably die of starvation at
one oclock guided by the hunter they
mounted and left the camp the gro-
tesque attitudes of strux as he clung
uneasily to his steed caused consider-
able diversion to his companions who
however were polite enough to pass no
remark

  before leaving the camp mokoum
asked the pioneer to lend him his keen-
scented dog the sagacious animal
after scenting a hat belonging to pal-
ander darted off in a northeasterly di-
rection whilst his master urged him on
by a peculiar whistld the little troop
followed and soon disappeared in the
underwood

all the day the colonel and his
companions followed the dog who
seemed instinctively to know what was
required of him they shouted they
fired their guns but night came on when
they had scoured the woods for five
miles around and they were at length
obliged to rest until the following day
they spent the night in a grove before
which the bushman had prudently kin-
dled a wood fire some wild howls were
heard by no means reassuring hours
passed in arguing about palander and
discussing plans for his assistance the
english showed as much devotion as
strux could desire and it was decided
that all work should be adjourned till
the russian was found alive or dead

  after a weary night the day dawned
the horses were saddled and the little
troop again followed the dog toward
the northeast they arrived at a district
almost swampy in its character the
small water courses increased in num-
ber but they were easily forded care
being taken to avoid the crocodiles of
which sir john for the first time in his
life now saw some specimens the
bushman would not permit that time

should be wasted in any attack upon the
reptiles and restrained sir john who
was always on the qui-vive to discharge
a ball whenever a crocodile snapping
its prey with its formidable jaw put
its head out of water the horses set off
at a gallop to escape

  the troop of riders went on over
woods plains and marshes noting the
most insignificant tokens here a broken
bough there a freshly-trodden tuft of
grass or farther on some inexplicable
mark but no trace of palander

  when they had advanced ten miles
north of the last encampment and were
about to turn southeast the dog suddenly
gave signs of agitation he barked and
in an excited way wagged his tail
sniffing the dry grass he ran on a few
steps and returned to the same spot

  the dog scents something ex-
claimed the bushman

  it seems said sir john he is on
a right track listen to his yelping he
seems to be talking to himself he
will be an invaluable creature if he scents
out palander

  strux did not quite relish the way
in which his countryman was treated as
a head of game but the important thing
now was to find him and they all waited
to follow the dog as soon as he should
be sure of the scent

  very soon the animal with a loud
yelp bounded over the thicket and dis-
appeared the horses could not follow
through the dense forest but were
obliged to take a circuitous path the
dog was certainly on the right track now
the only question was whether pal-
ander was alive or dead

  in a few minutes the yelping ceased
and the bushman and sir john who
were in advance were becoming uneasy
when suddenly the barking began again
outside the forest about half a mile away
the horses were spurred in that direc-
tion and soon reached the confines of
measuring a meridian



the marsh the dog could distinctly be
heard but on account of the lofty reeds
could not be seen the riders dis-
mounted and tied their horses to a tree
with difficulty they made their way
through the reeds and reached a large
space covered with water and aquatic
plants in the lowest part lay the
brown waters of a lagoon half a mile
square the dog stopped at the muddy
edge and barked furiously

  there he is cried mokoum

  and sure enough on a stump at the
extremity of a sort of peninsula sat
nicholas palander pencil in hand and
a notebook on his knees wrapt in cal-
culations his friends could not sup-
press a cry about twenty paces off a
number of crocodiles quite unknown to
him lay watching and evidently design-
ing an attack

  make haste said mokoum in a low
voice i dont understand why these
animals dont rush on him

  they are waiting till he is gamey
said sir john alluding to the idea com-
mon among the natives that these reptiles
never touch fresh meat

the bushman and sir john telling
his companions to wait for them
passed round the lagoon and reached the
narrow isthmus by which alone they
could get near palander they had not
gone two hundred steps when the croco-
diles leaving the water made straight
toward their prey palander saw noth-
ing but went on writing

  be quick and calm whispered
kokoutn or all is lost

  both kneeling down aimed at the
nearest reptiles and fired two mon-
sters rolled into the water with broken
backs and the rest simultaneously dis-
appeared beneath the surface

  at the sound of the guns palander
raised his head he recognized his com-
panions and ran towards them waving

his note-book and like the philosopher
of old exclaiming eureka he cried
i have found it

  what have you found asked sir
john

  an error in the last decimal of a
logarithm of james wolstons

  it was a fact the worthy man had
discovered the error and had secured a
right to the prize offered by wolstons
editor for four days had the astron-
omer wandered in solitude truly
ampere with his unrivaled gift of ab-
straction could not have done better

chapter xii

a battle with lions

so the russian mathematician was
found when they asked him
how he had passed those four
days he could not tell he thought the
whole story of the crocodiles was a
joke and did not believe it he had
not been hungry he had lived upon
figures matthew strux would not re-
proach his countryman before his col-
leagues but there was every reason to
believe that in private he gave him a
severe reprimand

  the goedetic operations were now re-
sumed and went on as usual till the
th of june when they had measured
the base of the th triangle which
would conclude the second and com-
mence the third degree of the meridian
here a physical difficulty arose the
country was so thickly covered with un-
derwood that although the artificial
signals could be erected they could not
be discerned at any distance one sta-
tion was recognized as available for an
electric lamp this was a mountain
 feet high about thirty miles to
the northwest the choice of this would
make the sides of this triangle consider-
ably longer than any of the former but


amazing stories

it was at length determined to adopt it
colonel everest emery zorn three
sailors and two bochjesmen were ap-
pointed to establish the lighted signal
the distance being too great to work
otherwise than at night

  the little troop accompanied by mules
laden with the instruments and provi-
sions set off in the morning the
colonel did not expect to reach the base
of the mountain till the following day
and however few might be the diffi-
culties of the ascent the observers in
the camp would not see the lighted signal
till the night of the th or th

  in the interval of waiting strux and
palander went to their usual occupa-
tions while sir john and the bushman
shot antelopes they found opportunity
of hunting a giraffe which is considered
fine sport coming across a herd of
twenty but so wild that they could not
approach within  yards they suc-
ceeded in detaching a female from the
herd the animal set off at first at a
slow trot allowing the horsemen to gain
upon her but when she found them
near she twisted her tail and started at
full speed the hunters followed for
about two miles when a ball from sir
johns rifle threw her on to her side
and made her an easy victim

  in the course of the next night the
two russians took some altitudes of the
stars which enabled them to determine
the latitude of the encampment the
following night was clear and dry with-
out moon and stars and the observers
impatiently watched for the appearance
of the electric light strux palander
and sir john relieved guard at the tele-
scope but no light appeared they con-
cluded that the ascent of the mountain
had offered serious difficulty and again
postponed their observations till the next
night great however was their sur-
prise when about two oclock in the
afternoon colonel everest and his com-

panions suddenly reappeared in camp

  in answer to inquiries whether he had
found the mountain inaccessible colonel
everest replied that although in itself
the mountain was entirely accessible it
was so guarded that they had found it
necessary to come back for reinforce-

  do you mean said sir john that
the natives were assembled in force

  yes natives with four paws and thick
manes who have eaten up one of our
horses

  the colonel went on to say that the
mountain was only to be approached by
a spur on the southwest side in the
narrow defile leading to the spur a troop
of lions had taken up their abode these
he had endeavored to dislodge but in-
sufficiently armed he was compelled to
beat a retreat after losing one of his
horses by a single blow of a lions paw

the recital kindled the interest of
sir john and the bushman clearly
it was a station worth conquering and
an expedition was at once arranged all
the europeans without exception were
eager to join but it was necessary that
some should remain at the camp to
measure the angles at the base of the
triangle therefore the colonel resolved
to stay behind with strux and palander
while sir john emery and zorn to
whose entreaties their chiefs had been
obliged to yield mokoum and three
natives on whose courage he could rely
made up the party for the attack

  they started at four in the after-
noon and by nine were within two miles
of the mountain here they dismounted
and made their ararngements for the
night no fire was kindled mokoum
being unwilling to provoke a nocturnal
attack from the animals which he wished
to meet by daylight

  throughout the night the roar of the
lions could almost incessantly be heard
measuring a meridian



not one of the hunters slept for so
much as an hour and mokoum took ad-
vantage of their wakefulness to give
them some advice from his own experi-
ence

  from what colonel everest tells us
he said calmly these are black-maned
lions the fiercest and most dangerous
species of any they rush for a dis-
tance of sixteen to twenty paces and i
should advise you to avoid their first
bound should the first fail they rarely
take a second we will attack them as
they re-enter their den at daybreak
they are always less fierce when they
are well filled but they will defend
themselves well for here in this unin-
habited district they are unusually fero-
cious measure your distance well before
you fire let the animal approach and
take a sure aim near the shoulder we
must leave our horses behind the sight
of a lion terrifies them and therefore
the safety of their rider is imperiled
we must fight on foot and i rely on
your calmness

  all listened with silent attention
mokoum was now the patient hunter
although the lion seldom attacks a man
without provocation yet his fury when
once aroused is terrible and therefore
the bushman enjoined composure on his
companions especially sir john who
was often carried away by his boldness

  shoot at a lion said mokoum as
calmly as if you were shooting a par-
tridge

  at four oclock only a few red streaks
being visible in the far east the hunters
tied up their horses securely and left
their halting-place

  examine your guns and be careful
that your cartridges are in good trim
continued mokoum to those who carried
rifles for the three natives were armed
otherwise satisfied with their bows of
aloe which already had rendered them
good service

  the party in a compact group turned
towards the defile which had been par-
tially reconnoitered the evening before
they crept like red indians silently
between the trees and soon reached the
narrow gorge which formed the entrance
here winding between piles of granite
began the path leading to the first slopes
of the spur midway the path had been
widened by a landslide and here was the
cave tenanted by the lions

  it was then arranged that sir john
one of the natives and mokoum should
creep along the upper edge of the defile
with the intention of driving out the
animals to the lower extremity of the
gorge there the two voung europeans
and the other two bochjesmen should
be in ambush to receive the fugitive
beasts with shot and arrows

  no spot could be better adapted for
the maneuvers the forked branches of
a gigantic sycamore afforded a safe posi-
tion since lions do not climb and the
hunters perched at a considerable height
could escape their bounds and aim at
them under favorable conditions

  william emery objected to the plan
as being dangerous for sir john and the
bushman but the latter would hear of
no modification and emery reluctantly
acquiesced

  day now began to dawn and the
mountain-top was glowing in the sun
mokoum after seeing his four com-
panions installed in the sycamore started
off with sir john and the bochjesman
and soon mounted the devious path
which lay on the right edge of the
defile cautiously examining their path
they continued to advance in the event
of the lions having returned to their
den and being at repose it would be
possible to make short work of them

after about a quarter of an hour
the hunters reaching the landslide
before the cave to which zorn had di-


amazing stories

rected them crouched down and ex-
amined the spot it seemed a wide
excavation though at present they could
hardly estimate the size the entrance
was marked by piles of bones and re-
mains of animals demonstrating be-
yond doubt that it was the lions retreat

  contrary to the hunters expectation
the cave seemed deserted he crept to
the entrance and satisfied himself that
it was really empty calling his com-
panions who joined him immediately
he said

  our game has not returned sir
john but it will not be long i think
we had better install ourselves in its
place better to be besieged than be-
siegers especially as we have an armed
succor at hand what do you think

  i am at your orders mokoum re-
plied sir john

  all three accordingly entered it was
a deep grotto strewn with bones and
stained with blood repeating their
scrutiny lest they should be mistaken
as to the cave being empty they has-
tened to barricade the entrance by piling
up stones the intervening spaces being
filled with boughs and dry brushwood
this only occupied a few minutes the
mouth of the cave being comparatively
narrow they then went behind their
loopholes and awaited their prey which
was not long in coming a lion and
two lionesses approached within a hun-
dred yards of the cave the lion toss-
ing his mane and sweeping the ground
with his tail carried in his teeth an
antelope which he shook with as much
ease as a cat would a mouse the two
lionesses frisked along at his side

  sir john afterwards confessed that it
was a moment of no little trepidation 
he felt his pulses beat fast and was con-
scious of something like fear but he
was soon himself again his two com-
panions retained their composure un-
disturbed

  at the sight of the barricade the
beasts paused they were within sixty
paces with a harsh roar from the
lion they all rushed into the thicket on
the right a little below the spot where
the hunters had first stopped their
tawny backs and gleaming eyes were
distinctly visible through the foliage

  the partridges are there whispered
sir john let us each take one

  no answered mokoum softly the
brood is not all here and the report of
a gun would frighten the rest bochjes-
man are you sure of your arrow at this
distance 

  yes mokoum said the native
then aim at the males left flank
and pierce his heart

 the bochjesman bent his bow and
the arrow whistled through the brush-
wood with a loud roar the lion made
a bound and fell he lay motionless
and his sharp teeth stood out in strong
relief against his blood-stained lips

 well done bochjesman said
mokoum

  at this moment the lionesses leaving
the thicket flung themselves on the lions
body attracted by their roar two other
lions and a third lioness appeared round
the corner of the defile bristling with
anger they looked twice their ordinary
size and bounded forward with terrific
roars

  now for the rifles cried the bush-
man we must shoot them on the wing
since they will not perch

 the bushman took deliberate aim
and one lion fell as if i were paralyzed
the other his paw broken by sir johns
bullet rushed towards the barricade fol-
lowed by the infuriated lionesses un-
less the rifles could now be brought suc-
cessfully to bear the three animals would
succeed in entering their den the hunt-
ers retired their guns were quickly re-
loaded two or three lucky shots and
all would be well but an unforeseen
measuring a meridian



circumstancc occurred which rendered
the hunters situation to the last degree
alarming

  all at once a dense smoke filled the
cave one of the wads falling on the
dry bushwood had set it alight and
soon a sheet of flames fanned by the
wind lay between the men and the
beasts the lions recoiled but the hunt-
ers would be suffocated if they remained
where they were it was a terrible mo-
ment but they dared not hesitate

  come out come out cried mokoum

ta hey pushed aside the brushwood
 with the butt ends of their guns
knocked down the stones and half
choked leaped out of the cloud of
smoke

  the native and sir john had hardly
lime to collect their senses when they
were both knocked over the african
struck on the chest by one of the lion-
esses lay motionless on the ground sir
john who received a blow from the
tail of the other thought his leg was
broken and fell on his knees but just
as the animal turned upon him a ball
from the bushman arrested her and
meeting a bone exploded in her body
at this instant zorn emery and the
two bochjesmen appeared opportunely
although unsummoned hastening up the
defile two lions and one lioness were
dead but two lionesses and the lion
with the broken paw were still suffi-
ciently formidable the rifles however
performed their duty a second lioness
fell struck in both head and flank the
third lioness and the wounded lion
bounded over the young mens heads
and amid a last salute of balls and ar-
rows disappeared round the corner of
the defile

  sir john uttered a loud hurrah the
lions were conquered four carcasses
measured the ground

  with his friends assistance sir john

was soon on his feet again his leg was
not broken the native soon recovered
his consciousness being merely stunned
by the blow from the animals head
an hour later the little troop without
further trace of the fugitive couple
regained the thicket where they had left
their horses

 well said mokoum to sir john
i hope you like our african partridges

 delightful delightful said sir
john rubbing his leg but what tails
they have to he sure

chapter xiii

a disagreement and its solution

at the camp colonel everest and
his colleagues with a natural im-
patience anxiously abided the
result of the lion hunt if the chase
proved successful the light would ap-
pear in the course of the night the
colonel and strux passed the day un-
easily palander always engrossed for-
got that any danger menaced his friends
it might be said of him as of the
mathematician bouvard he will con-
tinue to calculate while he continues to
live for apart from his calculation life
for him would have lost its purpose

  the two chiefs certainly thought quite
as much of the accomplishment of their
survey as of any danger incurred by
their companions  they would themselves
have braved any peril rather than have
a physical obstacle arrest their opera-
tions

 at length after a day that seemed
interminable the night arrived punctu-
ally every half hour the colonel and
matthew strux silently relieved guard
at the telescope each desiring to be first
to discover the light but hours passed
on and no light appeared at last at
a quarter to three colonel everest arose
and calmly said the signal

  the russian although he did not
utter a word could scarcely conceal his
chagrin which he felt at chance favor-
ing the colonel

  the angle was then carefully meas-
ured and was found to be exactly 
 

  colonel everest being anxious to join
his companions as soon as possible the
camp was raised at dawn and by mid-
day all the members of the commission
had met once more the incidents of
the lion-hunt were recounted and the
victors heartily congratulated

  during the morning sir john emery
and zorn had proceeded to the summit
of the mountain and had thence meas-
ured the angular distance of a new sta-
tion situated a few miles to the west of
the meridian palander also announced
that the measurement of the second de-
gree was complete

  for five weeks all went on well the
weather was fine and the country being
only slightly undulating offered fair sites
for the stations provisions were abun-
dant and sir johns revictualing expedi-
tions provided full many a variety of
antelopes and buffaloes the general
health was good and water could always
be found even the discussions between
the colonel and strux were less violent
and each seemed to vie with the other
in zeal for success when a local diffi-
culty occurred which for a while hin-
dered the work and revived hostilities

  it was the th of august during
the night the caravan had passed through
a wooded country and in the morning
halted before an immense forest extend-
ing beyond the horizon imposing masses
of foliage formed a verdant curtain
which was of indescribable beauty there
were the gounda the mosokoso and
the mokoumdon a wood much sought
for shipbuilding great ebony trees their
bark covering a perfectly black wood
bauhinias with fiber of iron buch-

neras with their orange-colored flow-
ers  magnificent roodeblatts with
whitish trunks crowned with crimson
foliage and thousands of guaiacums
measuring fifteen feet in circumference
there was ever a murmur like that of
the surf on a sandy coast it was the
wind which passing across the branches
was calmed on the skirts of the forest
in answer to a question from the
colonel mokoum said it is the forest
of rovouma

  what is its size

  it is about forty-five miles wide and
ten long

  how shall we cross it

  cross it we cannot said mokoum
there is but one resource we must go
round either to the east or to the west
at this intelligence the chiefs were
much perplexed in the forest they
could not establish stations to pass
round would involve them in an addi-
tional series of perhaps ten auxiliary
triangles

f tere was a difficulty of no little

	 magnitude encamping in the
shade of a magnificent grove about half
a mile from the forest the astronomers
assembled in council the question of
surveying across the mass of trees was
at once set aside and it now remained
to determine whether they should make
the circuit to the east or the west since
the meridian passed as nearly as pos-
sible through the center of the forest
on this point arose a violent discussion
between the colonel and strux the
two rivals renewed their old animosity
and the discussion ended in a serious
altercation their colleagues attempted
to interfere but to no purpose the
englishman wished to turn to the right
since that direction approached the
route taken by dr livingstone in his
expedition to the zambesi falls and the
country would on that account be more
measuring a meridian



known and frequented the russian on
the contrary insisted on going to the
left but apparently for no other reason
than to thwart the colonel the quarrel
went so far that a separation between
the members of the commission seemed
imminent zorn emery sir john and
palander withdrew and left their chiefs
to themselves such was their obstinacy
that it seemed as if the survey must con-
tinue from this point in two oblique
-eries of triangles

  the day passed away without any
econciliation and the next morning sir
fohn finding matters still in the same
condition proposed to mokoum to beat
the neighborhood perhaps meanwhile
the astronomers would come to an un-
derstanding anyway some fresh venison
would not be despised

  mokoum always ready whistled to
his dog top and the two hunters ven-
tured several miles from the encamp-
ment the conversation naturally turned
on the subject of the difficulty

  i expect said the bushman we
shall be encamped some time here our
two chiefs are like ill-paired oxen one
pulls one way and the other another
and the consequence is that the wagons
make no headway

  it is all very sad answered sir
john and looks like a separation the
interests of science are compromised
otherwise i should be indifferent to it
all i should amuse myself with my
gun until the rivals made it up

  do you think they will make it up
for my part i am almost afraid that
our halt will be indefinitely prolonged

  i fear so mokoum replied sir
john the matter is so trivial and it
is no question of science our chiefs
would doubtless have yielded to a
scientific argument but they will never
make a concession in a pure matter of
opinion how unfortunate that the
meridian happens to cross this forest

  hang the forest exclaimed the
bushman dont let them stop your
measuring if you want to measure but
i cant see the good of your getting at
the length and breadth of the earth
who will be any better off when every-
thing is reduced to feet and inches

i	should just like to think of the globe
as infinite to measure it is to make it
small no sir john if i were to live
forever i could never understand the
use of your operations

  sir john could not help smiling they
had often debated the subject and the
ignorant child of nature could evidently
not enter into the interest attached to
the survey whenever sir john at-
tempted to convince him he answered
eloquently with arguments stamped with
a genuine naturalness of which sir john
half savant and half hunter could fully
appreciate the charm

  thus conversing the hunters pursued
the rock-hares the shrill-toned plovers
the partridges with brown yellow and
black plumage and other small game
but sir john had all the sport to him-
self the bushman seldom fired he was
pre-occupied the quarrel between the
two astronomers seemed to trouble him
more than it did his companion and the
variety of game hardly attracted his
notice in truth there was an idea float-
ing through his brain which little by
little tool more definite form sir john
heard him talking to himself and
watched him as he quietly let the game
pass by as engrossed as palander him-
self two or three times in the course
of the day he drew near sir john and
said so you really think that colonel
everest and mr strux will not come
to terms

  sir john invariably replied that agree-
ment seemed unlikely and that he feared
there would be a separation between
englishmen and russians the last time
mokoum received this answer he added

well you may be easy i have found
a means to satisfy both the chiefs be-
fore to-morrow if the wind is favorable
they will have nothing to quarrel about
what do you mean to do mokoum
never mind sir john

  very well i will leave it to you
you deserve to have your name pre-
served in the annals of science

  that would be too great an honor
for me sir john answered the bush-
man and then continued silently to
ponder over his project sir john made
no further inquiries but could not at
all guess how the bushman proposed to
reunite the two adversaries

  towards evening the hunters returned
to camp and found matters even worse
than before the oft-repeated inter-
vention of zorn and emery had been of
no avail and the quarrel had now reached
such a height that reconciliation seemed
impossible it appeared only too prob-
able that the survey would be continued
in two separate directions the thought
of this was sorrowful to emery and
zorn who were- now so nearly hound
by mutual sympathy sir john guessed
their thoughts and was eager to reassure
them but however much he was secretly
disposed to trust to the bushman he
abstained from raising any hopes which
might be fallacious

  throughout the evening mokoum did
not leave his ordinary occupations he
arranged the sentinels and took the
usual precautions sir john began to
think that he had forgotten his promise
before going to rest he tried to sound
colonel everest whom he found immov-
ably resolved that unless strux yielded
the english and russians must part
there are things added the colonel
in a tone of decision that cannot be
borne even from a colleague

  sir john very uneasy retired to his
bed and being fatigued with his days
sport was soon asleep towards eleven

oclock he was suddenly aroused by the
natives running to and fro in the camp
he quickly rose and found everyone on
their feet the forest was on fire in
the dark night against the black sky
the curtain of flame seemed to rise to
the zenith and in this incredibly short
time the fire had extended for several
miles

  sir john looked at mokoum who
standing near made no answer to his
glance but he at once understood the
fire was designed to open a road through
that forest which had stood impervious
for ages the wind from the south
was favorable the air rushing as from
a blower accelerated the conflagration
and furnished an ever fresh supply of
oxygen it animated the flames and
kept the kindled branches burning like
a myriad brands the scattered frag-
ments became new centers for fresh
outbreaks of flame the scene of the fire
became larger and the heat grew in-
tense the dead wood piled under the
dark foilage crackled and ever and
anon louder reports and brighter light
told that the resinous trees were burn-
ing like torches then followed explo-
sions like cannonades as the great trunks
of ironwood burst asunder with a rever-
beration as of bombs the sky reflected
the glow and the clouds carried the
rosy glare kgh aloft showers of sparks
emitted from the wreaths of smoke
studded the heavens like red-hot stars

  then on every side were heard the
howls shieks and bellowings of herds
of bewildered hyenas buffaloes and
lions elephants rushed in every direc-
tion like huge dark specters and disap-
peared beyond the horizon

  the fire continued throughout the fol-
lowing day and night and when day
broke on the th a vast space several
miles wide had been opened across the
forest a passage was now free for
the meridian the daring genius of
measuring a meridian



mokoum had arrested the disaster which
threatened the survey

war interrupts

all pretext for quarreling being
now removed the colonel and
strux somewhat rancorous at
heart recommenced their joint labors
about five miles to the left of the gap
made by the conflagration rose an emi-
nence which would serve as the vertex
of a new triangle when the requisite
observations were complete the caravan
set off acrosss the burnt forest

  the road was paved with embers the
soil was still burning and here and
there smouldered stumps of trees while
a hot steam rose around in many places
lay the blackened carcasses of animals
which had been unable to make their
escape wreaths of smoke gave evi-
dence that the fire was not yet extinct
and might still be rekindled by the wind
had the flames burst out again the
caravan must inevitably have been de-
stroyed toward the middle of the day
however it was safely encamped at
the foot of the hill here was a mass of
rock which seemed to have been ar-
ranged by the hand of man it was a
kind of cromlech-a surprising erection
to find in that locality-resembling the
structures attributed to the druids and
which ever furnish fresh interest to the
archaeologist the most credible sug-
gestion was that it must be the remains
of some primitive african altar

  the two young astronomers and sir
john murray wished to visit the fan-
tastic construction and accompanied by
the bushman they ascended the slope
they were not above twenty paces from
the cromlech when a man hitherto con-
cealed behind one of the massy stones
at the base appeared for a moment and

descending the hill stole quickly away
into a thicket that had been untouched
by the fire the momentary glance was
enough for the bushman a makololo
he cried and rushed after the native
sir john followed and both in vain
searched the wood the native knowing
the short paths had escaped where the
most experienced hunter could not have
traced him when the incident was re-
lated to colonel everest he sent for mo-
koum and asked him who the man was
what he was doing and why he had
followed him

  he is a makololo colonel replied
mokoum he belongs to one of the
northern tribes that haunt the affluents
of the zambesi not only is he an
enemy of us bochjesmen but he is a
plunderer of all who venture into the
country he was spying us and we shall
be lucky if we have not cause to regret
that we couldnt get hold of him

  but what have we to fear from a
band of robbers  asked the colonel
are not our numbers sufficient to resist
them 

  at present yes replied the bush-
man  but in the north these tribes are
more frequent and it is difficult to avoid
them if this makololo is a spy as i
suspect he will not fail in putting several
hundreds of these robbers on our track
and then colonel i would not give a
farthing for all your triangles

 the colonel was vexed he knew
that the bushman was not the man to
exaggerate danger and that all he said
ought to be duly weighed the inten-
tions of the native were certainly sus-
picious his sudden appearance and im-
mediate flight showed that he was caught
deliberately spying no doubt he would
announce the approach of the commis-
sion to the tribes of the north there
was however no help for it now the
caravan must continue its march with
extra precautions

  on the th of august the astrono-
mers completed their twenty-second tri-
angle and with it the third degree of
the meridian finding by the map that
the village of kolobeng was about 
miles to the northeast they resolved to
turn thither for a few dayss rest for
nearly six months they had had no com-
munication with the civilized world and
at kolobeng an important village and
missionary station they would probably
hear news from europe besides being
enabled to pre-provision the caravan

the remarkable cromlech was at
once chosen as the landmark whence
subsequent operations should commence
and the colonel gave the signal for de-
parture with no further incident the
caravan reached kolobeng on the d
the village was merely a mass of native
huts the uniformity of which was re-
lieved by the depot of the missionaries
who had settled there formerly called
lepelole it is marked on some maps
litoubarouka here dr livingstone
stayed for some months in  to learn
the habits of the bechuanas or bakou-
ins as they are more generally termed
in this part of the country

  with all hospitality the missionaries
received the europeans and put every
available resource at their disposal liv-
ingstones house was still to be seen
sacked and ruined as when visited by
baldwin the boers had not spared it
in their incursion of 

 all eagerly asked for news from
europe but their curiosity could not be
immediately satisfied as no courier had
reached the mission in the last six
months but in about a week the prin-
cipal said they expected journals and
dispatches since they had already heard
of the arrival of a carrier on the banks
of the upper zambesi a week was
just the period that the astronomers de-
sired for their rest and all except pal-

ander who constantly revised his calcu-
lations passed the time in a complete
far niente the stern matthew strux
held himself aloof from his english col-
leagues and emery and zorn took many
walks in the neighborhood the firmest
friendship united these two and they
believed that nothing could break the
closeness of their sympathy

  on the th the eagerly-expected mes-
senger arrived he was a native of kil-
maine a town by the delta of the
zambesi a merchantman from the
mauritius trading in gum and ivory
had landed on that coast early in july
and delivered the dispatches for the mis-
sionaries the papers were dated two
months back for the native had taken
four weeks to ascend the zambesi

  on the arrival of the messenger the
principal of the mission had handed to
colonel everest a bundle of european
newspapers chiefly the times the daily
news and the journal des debats the
intelligence they contained had under
the circumstances a special  nportance
and produced an unexpected emotion
among the entire party

  the members of the commission were
all together in the chief room of the
mission colonel everest drew out the
daily news for the th of may with
the intention of reading aloud to his col-
leagues scarcely had he glanced at
the first leading article when his brow
contracted and the paper trembled in
his hand in a few moments he re-
covered his usual composure

  what does the paper say colonel
asked sir john

  it is grave news gentlemen said
the colonel that i have to communi-
cate

  he kept the paper in his hand and
his colleagues waited eagerly for him to
speak to the surprise of all he rose
and advancing to matthew strux said

  before communicating the intelligence
measuring a meridian



conveyed in this paper i should wish
to make an observation to you

  i am ready to hear anything you may
say said strux much astonished

  the colonel then said solemnly

  mr strux hithero there has been
between us a rivalry more personal than
scientific which has rendered our co-
operation in the common cause some-
what difficult this i believe is to be
attributed to the fact of their being two
of us at the head of this expedition to
avoid antagonism there should be only
one chief to every enterprise you agree
with me do you not

  strux bowed in assent the colonel
went on

   this position unpleasant for each of
us must through recent circumstances
now be changed first sir let me say
that i esteem you highly as your position
in the scientific world demands i beg
you to believe that i regret all that has
passed between us

  these words were uttered with great
dignity even with pride there was no
humiliation in the voluntary apology so
nobly expressed and neither strux nor
his colleagues could guess his motive
perhaps the russian not having the
same incentive was not equally disposed
to forget any personal resentment how-
ever mastering his ill-feeling he replied 
with you colonel i think that no
rivalry on our part should be permitted
to injure the scientific work with which
we are entrusted i likewise hold you
in the esteem that your talents deserve
and in future i will do all in my power
to efface any personality from our rela-
tions but you spoke of a change i

do not understand-

  you will soon be made to under-
stand mr strux replied the colonel
with a touch of sadness in his tone but
first give me your hand

  here it is rejoined strux with a
slight hesitation without another word

the astronomers joined hands as friends

  now you are friends cried sir
john

   alas no said the colonel dropping
the russians hand henceforth we are
enemies separated by an abyss which
must keep us apart even on the territory
of science

   then turning to his colleagues he
added

gentlemen war is declared between

england and russia see the news is
conveyed by these english french and
russian newspapers

and in truth the war of  had
begun the english with their
allies the french and turks were fight-
ing before sebastopol the eastern ques-
tion was being submitted to the ordeal of
a naval conflict on the black sea

   the colonels words fell like a thun-
derbolt the english and russians with
their strong sentiment of nationality
started to their feet those three words
war is declared were enough they
were no longer companions united in
a common labor but already eyed one
another as avowed antagonists such is
the influence of these national duels on
the heart of man an instinctive im-
pulse had divided the europeans-nich-
olas palander himself yielding to the
feeling emery and zorn alone regarded
each other with more of sadness than
animosity and regretted that they had
not shaken hands before colonel ever-
ests communication no further con-
versation ensued exchanging bows eng-
lish and russians retired

   this novel situation although it would
not interrupt the survey would render
its continuation more difficult for the

chiefs it was decided by lot that the
russians should continue the meridian
already begun while the english should
choose an arc  or  miles to the west
and unite it to the first by a series of
auxiliary triangles they would then con-
tinue their survey as far as latitude 

  all these arrangements were made
without any outbreak personal rivalry
was swallowed up by national feeling
and the colonel and strux did not ex-
change an uncivil word but kept with-
in the strictest limits of politeness

  the caravan was equally divided each
party preserving its own stores the
steamboat fell by lot to the russians

  mokoum especially attached to sir
john followed the english caravan the
pioneer equally experienced headed the
russians each party retained its in-
struments and one of the rigisters

  on the st of august the commis-
sion divided the english cordially
thanked the missionaries for their kind
hospitality and started first to connect
their last station with their new meridian

  if before their departure anyone
had entered the privacy of the inner
room he would have seen emery grasp-
ing the hand of zorn once his friend
but now by the will of their majesties
the queen of england and the czar of
russia no longer friend but foe

chapter xv

a rhinoceros hunt

after the separation the english
astronomers continued their la-
bors with the same care and pre-
cision as hitherto three had now to do
the work of six and consequently the
survey advanced more slowly and was
attended with more fatigue but they
were not the men to spare themselves
the desire that the russians should not
surpass them in any way sustained them

in their task to which they gave all
their time and thoughts emery had to
indulge in fewer reveries and sir john
could not so often spare his time for
hunting a new programme was drawn
up assigning to each astronomer his
proper share of the labor sir john
and the colonel undertook all observa-
tions both in the sky and in the field
while emery replaced palander as calcu-
lator all questions were decided in
common and there was no longer any
fear that disagreement should arise
mokoum was still the guide and hunter
to the caravan the english sailors who
formed half the crew of the queen and
czar had of course followed their
countrymen and although the russians
were in possession of the steam-vessel
the india-rubber boat which was large
enough for ordinary purposes was the
property of the english the provision-
wagons were divided thus impartially
ensuring the revictualing of each cara-
van the natives likewise had to be
severed into two equal troops not with-
out some natural signs of displeasure
on their part far from their own pas-
turages and water-courses in a region
inhabited by wandering tribes hostile to
the tribes of the south they could scarce-
ly be reconciled to the prospect of sepa-
ration but at length by the help of
the bushman and the pioneer who told
them that the two detachments would
be comparatively a short distance apart
they consented to the arrangement

  on leaving kolobeng the english car-
avan re-entered the burnt forest and
arrived at the cromlech which had served
for their last station operations were
resumed and a large triangle carried
the observers at once ten or twelve miles
to the west of the old meridian

  six days later the auxiliary series of
triangles was finished and colonel ever-
est and his colleagues after consulting
the maps chose the new arc one
measuring a meridian



degree west of the other being  east
of the meridian of greenwich they
were not more than sixty miles from the
russians but this distance put any col-
lision between the two parties out of the
question so it was improbable that
their triangles would cross

  all through september the weather
was fine and clear the country was
fertile and varied but scantily populated
the forests which were few were
broken by wide open tracts and with
occasional mounds occuring in the prai-
ries made the district extremely favor-
able for the observations the region
was well provided with natural pro-
ducts the sweet scent of many of
the flowers attracted swarms of scar-
abaei and more especially a kind of bee
as nearly as possible like the european
depositing in clefts of rocks and holes
of trees a white liquid honey with a
delicious flavor occasionally at night
large animals ventured near the camp
there were giraffes varieties of antelopes
hyenas rhinoceroses and elephants but
sir john would not be distracted he
resolutely discarded his rifle for his tele-
scope

  under these circumstances mokoum
and some of the natives became purvey-
ors to the caravan and sir john had
some difficulty in restraining his excite-
ment when he heard the report of their
guns the bushman shot three prairie-
buffaloes the bokolokolos of the bechu-
anas formidable animals with glossy
black skins short strong legs fierce eyes
and small heads crowned with thick black
horns they were a welcome addition to
the fresh venison which formed the or-
dinary fare

the natives prepared the buffalo-
meat as the indians of the north do
their pemmican the europeans watched
their proceedings with interest though
at first with some repugnance the

flesh after being cut into thin slices and
dried in the sun was wrapped in a
tanned skin and beaten with flails till
it was reduced to a powder it was then
pressed tightly into leathern sacks and
moistened with boiling tallowy suet col-
lected from the animal itself to this
they added some marrow and berries
whose saccharine matter modified the
nitrogenous elements of the meat this
compound after being mixed and beaten
formed when cold a cake as hard as
a stone mokoum who considered his
pemmican a national delicay begged the
astronomers to taste the preparation at
first they found it extremely unpala-
table but becoming accustomed to the
flavor they soon learnt to partake of it
with great relish highly nourishing
and not at all likely to be tainted con-
taining moreover its nutritive elements
closely compacted this pemmican was
exactly suited to meet the wants of a
caravan traveling in an unknow rmn-
try the bushman soon had several hun-
dred pounds in reserve and they were
thus secure from any immediate want

  days and nights passed away in ob-
servations emery was always thinking
of his friend and deploring the fate
which had so suddenly severed the bond
of their friendship he had no one
to sympathize with his admiration of the
wild characteristics of the scenery and
with something of palanders enthusiasm
found refuge in his calculations col-
onel everest was cold and calm as ever
exhibiting no interest in anything beyond
his professional pursuits as for sir
john he suppressed his murmurs but
sighed over the loss of his freedom
fortune however sometimes made
amends for although he had no leisure
for hunting the wild beasts occasionally
took the initative and came near inter-
rupting his observations he then con-
sidered defense legitimate and rejoiced
to be able to make the duties of the

astronomer compatible with those of the
hunter

  one day he had a serious encounter
with an old rhinoceros which cost him
rather dear for some time the ani-
mal had been prowling about the flanks
of the caravan by the blackness of his
skin mokoum had recognized the chu-
curoo such is the native for this ani-
mal as a dangerous beast and one
which more agile than the white specics
often attacks man and beast without any
provocation

 on this day sir john and mokoum
had set off to reconnoiter a hill six miles
away on which the colonel wished to
establish an indicating post with a
certain foreboding sir john had brought
his rifle with conical shot instead of his
ordinary gun for although the rhino-
ceros had not been seen for two days
yet he did not consider it advisable to
traverse unarmed an unknown country
mokoum and his companions had al-
ready unsuccessfully chased the beast
which probably now had abandoned its
designs there was no reason to regret
the precaution the adventurers had
reached the summit of the hill when
at the base close to a thicket of no
large extent appeared the chucuroo he
was a formidable animal his small eyes
sparkled and his horns planted firmly one
behind the other on his bony nose furn-
ished a most powerful weapon of attack

the bushman caught sight of him
first as he crouched about half a
mile distant in a grove of lentisk

  sir john he cried fortune favors
you here is your chucuroo

  the rhinoceros exclaimed sir john
with kindling eyes for he had never be-
fore been so near the animal

  yes a magnificent beast and he
seems inclined to cut off our retreat
said the bushman why he should at-
tack us i can hardly say his tribe is not

carnivorous but anyway there he is
and we must hunt him out

  is it possible for him to get up
here to us asked sir john

  no his legs are too short and thick
but he will wait

  well let him wait said sir john
and when we have examined this sta-
tion we will try and get him out

  then they proceeded with their re-
connoitering and chose a spot on which
to erect the indicating-post they also
noticed other eminences to the northwest
which would be of use in constructing a
subsequent triangle

  their work ended sir john turned
to the bushman saying when you like
mokoum

  i am at your orders sir john the
rhinoceros is still waiting

  well let us go down a ball from
my rifle will soon settle matters

  a ball cried mokoum you dont
know a rhinoceros he wont fall with
one ball however well it may be aimed
nonsense began sir john that is
because people dont use conical shot
conical or round rejoined the bush-
man the first will not bring down such
an animal as that

  well said sir john carried away
by his self-confidence as you have your
doubts i will show you what our euro-
pean weapons can do

  and he loaded his rifle to be ready
to take aim as soon as he should be at
a convenient distance

  one moment sir john said the
bushman rather piqued will you bet
with me

  certainly said sir john

  i am only a poor man continued
mokoum but i will willingly bet you
half-a-crown against your first ball
done replied sir john instantly
half-a-crown to you if the rhinoceros
doesnt fall to my first shot

  the hunters descended the steep slope
measuring a meridian



and were soon posted within range of
the rhinoceros the beast was perfectly
motionless and on that account presented
an easy aim

  sir john thought his chance so good
that at the last moment he turned to
mokoum and said

  do you keep to your bargain
  yes replied the bushman

  the rhinoceros still being as motion-
less as a target sir john could aim
wherever he thought the blow would be
mortal he chose the muzzle and his
pride being roused he aimed with the
utmost care and fired the ball failed
in reaching the flesh it had merely shat-
tered to fragments the extremity of
one of the horns the animal did not
appear to experience the slightest shock

  that counts nothing said the bush-
man you didnt touch the flesh

  yes it counts replied sir john
rather vexed i have lost my wager but
come now double or quits

  as you please sir john but you
will lose

  we shall see

  the rifle was carefully reloaded and
sir john taking rather a random aim
fired a second time but meeting the
horny skin of the haunch the ball not-
withstanding its force fell to the ground
the rhinoceros moved a few steps

  a crown to me said mokoum
will you stake it again asked sir
john double or quits

  by all means said mokoum

  this time sir john who had begun
to get angry regained his composure
and aimed at the animals forehead the
ball rebounded as if it had struck a
metal plate

  half-a-sovereign said the bushman
calmly

  yes and another cried sir john ex-
asperated

  the shot penetrated the skin and
the rhinoceros made a tremendous bound

but instead of falling he rushed furi-
ously upon the bushes which he tore
and crushed violently

  i think he still moves said the bush-
man quietly

  sir john was beside himself his com-
posure again deserted him and he risked
the sovereign he owed the bushman on
a fifth ball he continued to lose again
and again but persisted in doubling the
stake at every shot at length the ani-
mal pierced to the heart fell

  sir john uttered a loud hurrah he
had killed his rhinoceros he had for-
gotten his disappointment but he did
not forget his bets it was startling to
find that the perpetually redoubled stakes
had mounted at the ninth shot to 
sir john congratulated himself on his
escape from such a debt of honor but
in his enthusiasm he presented mokoum
with several gold pieces which the bush-
man received with his usual equanimity

chapter xvi

a strange antelope

by the end of september the as-
tronomers had accomplished half
their task their diminished
numbers added to their fatigue so that
notwithstanding their zeal they oc-
casionally had to recruit themselves by
resting for several days the heat was
overpowering october in lat  s
corresponds to april in the northern hem-
isphere and for some hours after mid-
day work was impossible the bush-
man was alone uneasy at the delay for
he was aware that the arc was about to
pass through a singular region called a
karroo similar to that at the foot of
the roggeveld mountains in cape col-
ony in the damp season this district
presents signs of the greatest fertility
after a few days of rain the soil is
covered with a dense verdure in a very


amazing stories

short time flowers and plants spring up
everywhere pasturage increases and
water-courses are formed troops of an-
telopes descend from the heights and
take possession of these unexpected
prairies but this strange effort of
nature is of short duration in a month
or six weeks at most all the moisture is
absorbed by the sun the soil becomes
hardened and chokes the fresh germs
vegetation disappears in a few days
the animals fly the region and where
for awhile there was a rich fertility the
desert again asserts its dominion

  this karroo had to be crossed before
reaching the permanent desert bordering
on lake ngami the bushman was natu-
rally eager to traverse this region before
the extreme aridity should have exhaust-
ed the springs he explained his reasons
to the colonel who perfectly understood
and promised to hurry on the work
without suffering its precision to be af-
fected since on account of the state
of the atmosphere measuring was not
always practicable the operations were
not infrequently retarded and the bush-
man became seriously concerned lest
when they reached the karroo its char-
acter of fertility should have disappeared

  meanwhile the astronomers could not
fail to appreciate the magnificence
around never had they been in finer
country in spite of the high tempera-
ture the stream kept up a constant fresh-
ness and thousands of flocks would have
found inexhaustible pasturage clumps
of luxuriant trees rose here and there
giving the prospect at times the appear-
ance of an english park

  colonel everest was comparatively in-
different to these beauties but the others
were fully alive to the romantic aspect
of this temporary relief to the african
deserts emery now especially regretted
the alienation of his friend zorn and
often thought both would have delighted
in the charming scenery around them

  the advance of the caravan was en-
livened by the movements as well as by
the song-notes of a variety of birds
some of these birds were edible and the
hunters shot some brace of korans a
sort of bustard peculiar to the south
african plains and some dikkops
whose flesh is very delicate eating they
were frequently followed by voracious
crows instinctively seeking to avert at-
tention from their eggs in their nests of
sand in addition to these blue cranes
with white throats red flamingoes like
flames in the thinly scattered brushwood
herons curlews snipes kalas often
perching on a buffalos neck plovers
ibises which might have flown from some
hieroglyphic obelisk hundreds of enor-
mous pelicans flying in file-all were
observed to find congenial habitats in this
district where man alone is the strang-
er but of all the varieties of the feath-
ered race the most noticeable was the
ingenious weaver-bird whose green nests
woven with rushes and blades of grass
hung like immense pears from the
branches of the willows emery taking
them for a new species of fruit gathered
one or two and was much surprised to
hear them twitter like sparrows they
seemed some excuse for the ancient trav-
elers in africa who reported that cer-
tain trees in the country bore fruit pro-
ducing living birds

  the karroo was reached while still it
was lovely in its verdure gnus with
their pointed hoofs caamas elands and
gazelles abounded sir john could not
resist the temptation to obtain two days
leave from the colonel which he de-
voted with all his energy to his favorite
pastime under the guidance of the
bushman while emery accompanied as
an amateur he obtained many a success
to inscribe in his journal and many a
trophy to carry back to his highland
home his hand skillful with the deli-
cate instruments of the survey was at
measuring a meridian



home still more on his gun and his eye
keen to discern the remotest of stars
was quick to detect the merest movement
of a gazelle it was ever with something
of self-denial that he laid aside the char-
acter of the hunter to resume the duties
of the astronomer the bushmans un-
easiness was ere long renewed on the
second day of sir johns interval of rec-
reation mokoum had espied nearly two
miles to the right a herd of about twenty
of the species of antelope known as the
oryx he told sir john at once and
advised him to take advantage of the
fortune that awaited him adding that
the oryx was extremely difficult to cap-
ture and could outstrip the fleetest horse
and that cumming himself had not
brought down more than four

this was more than enough to
arouse the englishman he chose
his best gun his best horse and his best
dog and in his impatience preceding
the bushman he turned toward the copse
bordering the plain where the antelopes
had been seen in an hour they reined
in their horses and mokoum concealed
by a grove of sycamores pointed out
to his companion the herd grazing several
hundred yards to leeward he remarked
that one oryx kept apart

  he is a sentinel he said and doubt-
less cunning enough at the slightest
danger he will give his signal and the
whole troop will make their escape we
must fire from a long distance and hit
at the first shot

  sir john nodded in reply and sought
for a favorable position

  the oryxes continued quietly grazing
the sentinel as though the breeze had
brought suspicions of danger often
raised his head and looked warily
around but he was too far away for the
hunters to fire at him with success and
to chase the herd over the plain was
out of the question the only hope of

a lucky issue was that the herd might
approach the copse

  fortune seemed propitious gradually
following the lead of the sentinel male
the herd drew near the wood their in-
stinct perchance making them aware
that it was safer than the plain when
their direction was seen the bushman
asked his companion to dismount the
horses were tied to a sycamore and
their heads covered to secure them from
taking alarm

  followed by the dogs the hunters
glided through the creepers and brush-
wood till they were within three hun-
dred paces of the troop then crouch-
ing in ambush and waiting with loaded
guns they could admire the beauty of
the animals by a strange freak of
nature the females were armed with
horns more formidable than those of
the males the whole herd approached
the wood and awhile remained station-
ary the sentinel oryx as it seemed
was urging them to leave the plain he
appeared to be driving them some-
what as a sheep-collie collects a flock
into a compact mass the herd seemed
strangely indifferent and indisposed to
submit to the guidance of their leader
the bushman was perplexed he could
not understand the relative movements
of the sentinel and the herd

  sir john began to get impatient he
fidgeted with his rifle sometimes want-
ing to fire sometimes to advance and the
bushman had some trouble to restrain
him an hour passed away in this man-
men when suddenly one of the dogs
gave a loud bark and rushed toward the
plain the bushman felt angry enough
to send a ball into the excited brute the
oryxes fled and sir john saw at once
that pursuit was useless in a few sec-
onds they were no more than black
specks in the grass but to the bush-
mans astonishment it was not the old
male which had given the signal for


amazing stories

flight the oryx remained in its place
without attempting to follow and only
tried to hide in the grass

  strange said the bushman what
ails the creature is he hurt or crippled
with age

  we shall soon see said sir john
advancing toward the animal

 the oryx crouched more and more
in the grass only the tips of his long
horns were visible above the surface
but as he did not try to escape sir
john could easily get near him when
within a hundred paces he took aim and
fired the ball had struck the head for
the horns sunk into the grass the hunt-
ers ran hastily to the spot the bushman
held in his hand his hunting-knife in
case the animal should still live this
precaution was unnecessary the oryx
was so dead that when sir john took
hold of the horns he pulled nothing but
an empty flabby skin containing not so
much as a bone

  by st andrew these things happen
to no one but me he cried in a tone
so comical that anyone but the immov-
able mokoum would have laughed out-
right but mokoum did not even smile
his compressed lips and contracted brow
showed him to be utterly bewildered
with his arms crossed he looked quick-
ly right and left

  suddenly he caught sight of a little
red leather bag oramented with ara-
besques on the ground which he picked
up and examined carefully

  whats that asked sir john

  a makalolos pouch replied mo-
koum

  how did it get there

  the owner let it fall as he fled
  what do you mean

  i mean said mokoum clenching
his fists tightly that the makololo was
in the oryx skin and you missed him
sir john had not time to express his
astonishment when mokoum observ-
ing a movement in the distance with
all speed seized his gun and fired

  he and sir john hastened to the
suspected spot but the place was empty
they could perceive by the trampled
grass that someone had just been there
but the makalolo was gone and it was
useless to think of pursuit across the
prairie

  the two hunters returned much dis-
composed the presence of a makololo
at the cromlech together wih his dis-
guise not unfrequently adopted by oryx
hunters showed that he had systemati-
cally followed the caravan it was not
without design that he was keeping watch
upon the europeans and their escort
the more they advanced to the north
the greater danger there would be of be-
ing attacked by the plunderers

  emery was inclined to banter sir
john on his return from his holiday
without booty but sir john replied

  i hadnt a chance william the first
oryx i hunted was dead before i shot
at him

  is it possible the february issue is even

the best issue of amazing stories yet

  i like your idea of two serials per issue
i hope you keep it up

  i think that j h hennigars idea of a sub-

  we always get the kindest letters from
foreign readers we were somewhat afraid
of giving two serials in an issue but this
writer confirms the propriety of it and wants
us to keep it up the sub-title idea has an
element of danger in it and it may spoil the
story by divulging its nature one of the ob-
jections that have been made to cross-headings
is that they tell the story in advance we feel
that the foreword of a story can convey to the
reader some idea of its nature without reveal-
ing the plot and this certainly is better than a
mere sub-title one thing to be remembered
is that the magazine is of limited size if
circumstances permitted we could publish a
weekly edition so many authors are sending
us really good stories and when you miss an
author you must consider that his absence is
compensated for by the presence of others
your letter is certainly a comfort-editor

a devotee of cricket classifies our authors

editor amazing stories

  in writing this letter we are attempting to
accomplish a difficult task many readers have
hinted at it but as far as we can see no one has
actually set to work and labored over it

  in short we will endeavor to classify in the
form of an all american eleven the best
sciencefiction authors

  the following are the eleven best authors
which constitute the first team

  the line is

  harl vincent right end john taine right
tackle edmond hamilton right guard nathan
schachner center stanton a coblentz left
guard hyatt verrill left tackle jack wil-
liamson left end

  the backfield is

dr david h keller quarterback edward
elmer smith phd left halfback john w
campbell jr right halfback abraham merritt
fullback

  for the second team we have chosen

  neil r jones right end fletcher pratt right
tackle ed earl repp right guard jules verne
center lawrence manning left guard francis
flagg left tackle ray cummings left end

  the backfield is

  capt s p meek u s a quarterback
miles j breuer left halfback bob olsen right
halfback otfrid von hanstein fullback

  in our opinion hugo gernsback should be the
trainer and t oconor sloane the coach

  many a reader will inevitably complain say
ing why did those so and sos leave out my

team etc well in that case the most logical
thing to do is to write an all american eleven
yourself if you beg to differ with us in pick-
ing the members of these mythical teams we
have tried to remain impartial and to reason
out the dead facts so we beg of you readers to
go easy on us audacious lads if we have made a
mistake

  all the works of the picked authors did not
appear in amazing stories so we spent plenty
of time going over the other s f magazines
we are curious to see what the other readers
think of our choices so we hope this letter will
be printed	milton s rothman

  while it is true that philadelphia gave an
astonishingly brilliant reception to the manager
of the athletic baseball club we understand
that for a number of years philadelphia has
been quite devoted to cricket and that we pre-
sume is the reason that this letter deals in
elevens instead of in nines it is certainly
a novel idea and makes quite a picturesque
presentation and while novelty is not always
interesting we think that this novelty is de-
cidedly so and take great pleasure in publish-
ing this letter perhaps some baseball affiliates
will put our authors in the outer field or in
the inside diamond with a selection of pitchers

a plea for a weekly amazinc stories
written by a time traveller

editor amazing stories

  a peculiar longing came over me to see
familiar covers and magazines so out came the
large box in which the priceless treasures are
kept enough to ransom a king yes you
guessed it the whole batch of amazing stories
complete from  up and with only a few
numbers missing from  to my chagrin i
dern near broke my back carrying them up
too but it was certainly worth it

  immediately i was completely absorbed in
the scrutinization of the epic literature 
so oblivious of things about me that time
ceased to have any effect on me realizing this
i ztnlled inyself into the future by deep con-
centration

  i found myself in really a familiar world
the stories had it all pictured out noticing
a curious passer i inquired about the date he
replied  a a s b a w was i
flabbergasted then instantly i realized what it
meant after amazing stories became a
weekly

  i was covered with smiles as i hurried to the
library and asked for every copy of a s since
the last one i had read in my own time o boy

did they break their backs carrying them in
that just goes to show what a fellow will do
just to let another reader get some issues of
a s soon there were a few hundred piles
of them stacked high all around me before i
began reading i discovered something exceeding-
ly interesting what do you think is in the place
of the constitution nothing but the first issue
of a s yes sir everyone is a loyal sup-
porter now

  then i commenced a ready task and it was
exactly a year later when every one was read
but then i found  more waiting they went
the way of the rest never did i see so many
sequels the readers sure must have mobbed the
authors was i in my element

  all that time i had not slept a wink or
eaten a bite of food how you ask well in
reading the magazines i actually absorbed the
energy from the stories that did away with
eating and sleeping some power no some
story

  next i went to the airport and took in a
pleasant trip around the solar system believe
it or not ours is the most backward planet
every one but ours had science-fiction maga-
zines published for thousands of years  then
i went to the huge public laboratories where
after depositing the cash one thing you cant
get away from wherever you go i was whisked
to the th and the th dimensions rather in-
teresting though not quite like reading amaz-
ing stories

  seeing that all had been verified i united my-
self back to my right time right back to the
second of my departure quickly rushing to
some avid science-fiction enthusiasts i related
all that had happened i told about the a s
weekly though i never mentioned a single
word about the contents that would be
mutiny

  they all stared back at me some skeptical
and some with a faint hope of belief one of
them charles by name told me then and there
that it was a whale of a whopper some nar-
rative i looked him straight in the eye and
said vas you dere sharlie he was
thoroughly cowcd my argument was won be-
cause no one could prove that what i said was
not the truth i couldnt prove it was the
truth cither

  so all we can do is wait and see if i was
right as soon as an amazing stories weekly
comes out ill be victorious dont keep me
waiting mr ed

time traveler found out that eventually there
was to be a weekfy amazing stories one
pleasant feature about such letters as this is
that they seem to come from one of the family
the appreciative readers of amazing stories
and there are a great many of them always
seem to belong to us our relations with our
readers are the source of true pleasure-editor

criticism leading up to a sentence of
appreciation

editor amazing stories

  i am writing in to protest on the publication
of the edgar allan poe reprint story a descent
into the maelstrom it is undoubtedly a very
fine story but in offering it the editor con-
tradicts his own statements hasnt he many
times said that reprints would not be given be-
cause of their more or less general procurabil-
ity he has and i have always disagreed on
that with a few exceptions most of the old
classics have not been easy to get and are many
times in poor condition if obtained the few
exceptions however are the stories by poe and
wells these authors books are just about in
every library in the country and are easily
procurable it stands to reason that anyone
desiring to peruse the works of poe would
borrow or buy a complete volume and not
read a story a month via a s in other words
giving a poe story gyps us out of an original
story or a worthwhile reprint

  besides it is inconceivable that the editor has
misconstrued what the readers ask for i do not
recollect reading any letters asking for poe and
very few for verne in the past verne re-
prints didnt take with the readers what
we readers want are stories like the following
not necessarily these the metal monster
people of the pit palos of roy star pack
the mouthpiece of zitu catalepsy the
nth man queen of life almost im-
mortal the blind spot on the brink of
 messiah of the cylinder the air
trust columbus of space conquest of
mars vanishing men and many others

  lets have a showdown on the entire reprint
question once and for all will you reprint
stories we want or wont you or will you
give us entire reprint quarterlies or wont you
if you cant decide what reprints to present
print a list and ask the readers to list their
three top preferences then go ahead and give
us one after another the winning stories

  the february issue on the whole is excellent
and following the all-star january number as
it does  looks like a banner year for
s f fans terror out of space with even
its mediocre title indicates the biggest smash

a curious question is asked in this letter it

reads will you reprint stories we want or
wont you etc there are considerations
affecting the matter going into the magazine
enough to distract any ordinary individual we
are glad to see that you do approve of some
things in our pages your suggestion about
a readers vote on reprints would be excellent
if the readers would vote-editor

a letter of true appreciation of our
authors works

editor amazing stories

  terror out of space was wonderful at
least for the first part-and now for the
second i heartily agree with harry bates
that triplanetary is the best space story-
however i will not say ever written but
instead since invaders the time jump-
ers was a charming narrative glad to see
philip nowlan back again lets have more
from him

  i am waiting patiently for through the
andes and liners of time heres hoping
for an early publication

  i am heartily in favor of the reprint each
month but now that weve had verne and poe
lets have some of the earlier amazing
stories such as the man higher up or
the mad planet etc

  about time for a new spring quarterly
isnt it suggesting a columbus of space
the runaway skyscraper and the green
splotches what a reprint quarterly that
would make

  so-till the march issue arrives and i have
the pleasure of handing the required c piece
to the bookstall clcrk for a new quarterly-

  a number of readers have objected to re-
prints there is no reason why amazing
stories should be shut off from this sort of
excellent literature and this letter from the
western country really asks for them dr

brought him a full meed of praise-editor

good paper and in large size  in x  in
and sell it to the readers at a reasonable price

  i enjoy reading discussions and your edi-
torials but while amazing stories is in the
reduced size i think you should give us as
much fiction as possible print the editorial
in small print on one page and limit discussions
to five full pages

  amazing stories is poorly printed cant
you use an easier reading type

  we are giving discussions about double
the space that you suggest they are a most
characteristic part of the magazine and we are
very anxious to maintain this status which they
have acquired the editorials also have long
been a feature of the magazine starting with
the first issue and they have recently been
given more space and readers have expressed
their appreciation of them so we feel that
we are doing the right thing in making them
longer than formerly-editor 

a chinese edition of amazing stories is
suggested what does it mean

editor amazing stories

  dont let anybody kid you about the new
amazing stories its size is all right and its
story content equally so it is head and shoul-
ders over the old large size magazine of a year
or so ago the stories then were terrible and
generally of a much lower standard than they
are today for example some of the outstand-
ing sore thumbs i refer to are children of the
great magma intelligence gigantic an-
cients of easter island universal merry-go-
round the worst astronomy ive ever seen
beyond the end of space better of course
than a lot but for campbell-probably his
worst tomb of time in the scarlet star
treasure of the golden god world of the
living dead there were occasionally good
ones but not often two i can think of-
tumithak and cavern of thunders

  now look at the new magazine since oc-
tober of the new stories not a single one
was poor enough to be ranked anywhere near
that list i gave all were good the most
outstanding being perhaps men without
shadows battery of hate gold lost
language time jumpers not to mention
triplanetary and terror out of space
but there is one fault the reprints not
that theyre reprints but what a poor selec-
tion for printing outside of the watchs
soul which was poor all could be had
anytime from any library that is even of small-
est size poe can be had all over the world
there is not the slightest reason in the world
why you should reprint him the diamond
lens can also be had in many places there
are plenty of good science-fiction stories from

long ago to be had that are not to be found
everywhere surely yoi can dig up a few of
those i will not advocate your reprinting some
of the classics found in the old munsey maga-
zines such as darkness and dawn etc be-
cause i heard that the copyright owners wont
permit their publication in magazines i think
you must know that too why dont you say
so to a few of your reprint hounds and save
yourself a lot of pestering  perhaps you could
acquire the rights to some of the old science
fiction books now out of print you could
publish those in the quarterly

an interesting communication about the
science fiction association-a country-wide
response to the letter in our february issue

editor amazing stories 

  many thanks for having printed the letter
describing the science fiction associations
ambitious program in the february issue of
amazing stories the great number of mem-
bership applications that poured in on us speaks
volumes for the quality and strength of your
circulation in every part of the country for
which you are to be congratulated-or perhaps
your readers are to be congratulated on reading
so fine a magazine

 thanks to the influx of new members
due to the letter in amazing stories we are
now in a position to carry out at least a part
of our ambitious program the first part
calls for the publication in a single volume of
what our members consider the best science
fiction short stories of the past members
are daily casting their votes-since the entire
membership and not any committee or sub-
committee is deciding which stories are worthy
of inclusion in the volume and every member
can cast as many votes as he pleases if he
thinks it is worth while to write out a review
of the story stating the name of its author
and periodical and date on which it was pub-
lished-and the volume will probably be going
to press in a few months it will probably take
a good deal of time to arrange with the owners
of the copyrights and the authors for the pub-
lication but if things go forward as we expect
them to early  will greet the first publica-
tion of the science fiction association

  although there will be great expense involved
in the printing and binding of the volume a
copy will be sent to every member who has paid
the small annual fee required many of the
readers and authors of amazing stories will

doubtlessly be interested in securing a copy of
the book so i advise them to send their names
and addresses along with the twenty-five-cent
annual membership fee to a ostrow secre-
tary the science fiction association  e

membership will automatically place them on
the editorial board of the best science fiction

while at the same time belonging to a nation-

of science fiction and to making science fiction

this interesting letter requires no answer
except to say that the writer and his asso-
ciates have our best wishes for success in
their difficult undertaking there has been quite
a fad for publishing books of the alleged best
stories and it would seem that there is room
for the best science fiction stories to be thus
given to the public in book form-editor

back numbers to dispose of

editor amazing stories

  for some time i have been intending to
write to you to commend you for your good
work i have been reading your magazine
since its birth and have not missed a single
copy i am so well satisfied with it that i
have only one little complaint to make how
about some humor in science stories that make
you laugh i wonder how many readers liked
the scientific adventures of mr fosdick
and hicks inventions with a kick i won-
der what happened to those authors how
about some more of these stories stories by
dr keller and dr breuer are really gems
of sciencc stories the miracle of the lily
i consider the best story ever published in
conclusion i would like to say that i will sell
or trade all issues of a s from april 
to december  all these have covers
on them and are in pcrfcct condition and
are bound along the end with extra paper
tape also i have books by ray cummings
the man who mastered time and tarabi
the conqueror the reason i want to trade
them is they take up too much room anyone
interested in this please write to me

the humorous stories to which you refer
were greatly enjoyed by the writer of this note
sometimes one feels that too much of a taste
for humor is a misfortune and we have felt
that in our own case this may be too highly
developed but our correspondence indicated to
us that these stories were not acceptable to
our readers we hope that the publication of

this letter will bring you some answers-
editor

the editor has no distaste for interplanetary
as he never tried it-how did you
like it-morey is at last winning
appreciation for his work

editor amazing stories 

  i too noticed your comment on alan f
wiggens letter i firmly agree with a few
of a j stinnetts opinions but i do think it
is your own business if you want to bt a wet
blanket and show your disbelief of inter-
planetary travel i believe in inter-planetary
travel in the not-so-distant future why not

  i see morey has come into his own in a big
way the cover of the february  issue
was a masterpiece morey combines the work
of the famed paul the master wesso and all
the other petty artists into one grand slam of
a cover that knocks your eye out anyone that
has thought morey poor up to this issue should
now acknowledge him as the best artist that
science-fiction magazines ever could claim
thats some tribute to your genius morey but
it is a true one

  terror out of space by h haverstock
hill begins with a bang it is going to run a
close second with triplanetary

  i was all worked up over seeing bob olsens
name on the cover and the crowded out notice
was a great disappointment he is one of your
best authors and i think he should write more
stories

  the regenerative wonder was fairly good
and it reminded me of a story which came out
in  called one leg too many

   phil nowlan fails to reach the heights he at-
tained when he wrote armageddon and the
airlords of han many years ago there was
no excuse for the time jumpers when
i read a time story i like to hear the authors
theory concerning time explained it makes
the story more real and interesting

  the death protozoan by clifton b kruse
was excellent it reminded me of the ex-
terminator the white army and phago-
cytes

  i am glad to hear that the editor welcomes
criticism i know i would be a nervous
wreck if i had to listen to criticism all the time
but since you can take it and like it i will
do my bit to make you happy

  it will take nearly a quarter of a million
miles of travel through space to go to our
satellite the moon it would be something like
going around the world at the equator or in
any great circle ten times this would seem
a pretty serious proposition but when the dis-
tance to be traversed became an interplanetary
one ranging from forty millions of miles up-
wards it makes us feel that the future you

refer to is a very distant one as far as a
wet blanket is concerned the writer does not
believe that his views will affect those of eager
interplanetarians you will find in one of our
letters an expression of pleasure at the idea
of philip nowlan coming back to us with a
story it is the old proverb come true that
you cannot please everybody we will be glad
to have any more criticisms which you have to
offer they arc certainly a useful guide-

criticisms of stories-broadcasting to the
stars and the heaviside layer

editor amazing stories

  the two futuristic stories now running in
this magazine triplanetary by edward e
smith and terror out of space by h hav-
erstock hill are splendid especially the for-
mer i consider triplanetary far superier
to the skylark stories by the same author
in fact to me dr smith is ahead of all of
them in space traveling although harl vincent
and a few others run him pretty close at
times terror out of space is a good yarn
as well and in some respects it is more human
and less bizarre than triplanetary but tri-
planetary is hard to beat for excitement i
forgot my supper while reading the march
installment if i can do anything to persuade
you not to republish skylark or moon
pool et al stories i will be glad they answer
no purpose let us progress and not take a
retrogressive step in regard to these stories
most of them advance far into the future and
mankind will have to be a far brainier animal
than he is to-day to carry out the future ways
of mankind we are still in a semi-barbarous
condition we have only to read the daily
papers to know that and yet in our overrun-
ning conceit and egotism astronomers in their
dogmatic way tell us we are the only intelligent
beings in the universe if we are i dont
think there is much to it they tell us no
life can possibly exist on any other planet of
the solar system and with the exception
of mercury and venus all the others are dead
ice-covered worlds this is not possible for
presuming all the planets of the solar system
were separated from the sun by a passing
star at the same time jupiter and saturn
could not have cooled sufficiently and must be
in a more or less molten condition today i
dont think the spectroscope is able to tell us
very much about them as their reflected light
comes from the sun in fact there is a strong
possibility they possess life of some kind pre-
uming that they are in the condition the earth
was in  years ago in any case it
is a presumption on the part of these men to
assume there is no other life of an intelligent
order when we think of the countless trillions
of suns in the universe if i am not intruding
on your space and time dont you think the

chief reason we have never been able to com-
municate with another planet and they with
us is due to the heaviside layer which will
always prohibit radio waves passing through
it also is it not a fact there have been
several ice ages in the remote past of the
earths history and that these may have been
caused by the solar system passing through
more or less tenuous nebulous clouds of fine
dust or cosmic vapor of some kinds thousands
of light years across if my letter appears
somewhat involved please pass it on as i am
writing just as thoughts pass through my
mind

   we like this letter it expresses to a con-
siderable extent our own ideas and of course
one always likes to have other people feel as
they do a very common weakness of hu-
manity when we see what the governing
units are doing when we hear of one of the
best of them saying that war ennobles a nation
when we see them engaged in the equalization
of their powers for slaughter spending enor-
mous sums of money on ships-of-war an in-
spection of any one of which is depressing to
the soul of man or should be so because it
exhibits the highest phases of ingenuity and
constructive mechanics devoted to destruction
and death we should be depressed and ashamed
of ourselves

  the heaviside layer has the property of
reflecting long radio waves those of ordinary
length to this power is attributed the fact
that it is possible to send a radio message com-
pletely around the world by the aid of the
heaviside layer virtually holding the message
close to the earth ordinary radio waves
could not go through the heavyside layer-very
short or micro waves could penetrate it-

editor amazing stories

  i have been reading your magazine for six
years since i was eleven years old i can
never forget the day i first saw it oddly
enough it was in a bundle of old magazines
taken to a rag shop it was a quarterly
and contained the second deluge i can-
not remember the authors name new worlds
were opened to me i realize that i was then
too young to fully understand the stories but
they appealed to something within me at first
my father forbid my reading it but he picked
up a magazine i had bought in defiance of his
order and a new reader was bom he and i
quarrel over who is to read it first

a great deal better than the old it is easier
to bind and to put into volumes and it fits a
book shelf very nicely i realize that because
some readers do not like sigmonds covers
you have discontinued them but please cant
you have him alternate with morey to me
sigmonds covers are better expression of the
magazine than moreys they seem to get at
the soul of the magazine why not let him
try an occasional story illustration morey has
greatly improved since he first appeared in
your magazine but he has his limitations can-
not you also have wesso try his hand

  the authors appearing in the magazine are
the best in science fiction but sometimes one
writes a story that leaves a bad taste such a
one was the doubt

  i have no favorite authors but like the
following best they are not in the order
that i like them edward e smith ph d
john w campbell jr captain s p meek
jack williamson the two doctors breuer and
keller stanton a coblentz a merritt john
taine incidentally mr taine has not appeared
for a long time why not a story from him
and a reprint of one of merritts works
j l burtt also write some masterpieces for
his leumurian documents were such mur-
ray leinster ray cummings francis flagg
are a few more good authors-and p schuyler
miller is a very good writer-and to think that
four years ago he was unknown that proves
that there are good authors unknown waiting
for a chance to write why not run a story
contest you may unearth others as good as
mr miller i almost forgot neil r jones
is another talented author his stories of
professor jameson are greatly enjoyed by my
father and me a new arrival john russell
fearn was also admired by us

  the best stories that i can remember follow
naturally some are left out because i cant
remember over the whole period of six years

  all the skylark stories space-hounds of
i p c triplanetary promises well the
arcot stories by john w campbell jr
the stone from the green star and the
lady of light by jack williamson the last
deserves a sequel then the stories of awlo
of ulm and troyana by captain s p
meek the light from infinity by l a
eshbach was also a great story the swords-
man of sarvon by charles cloukey out of
the void by leslie f stone the detective
stories by bob olson also his fourth dimension
narratives omega the man by l h mor-
row was a poignant narration mr morrow
should appear more frequently the sages
of eros by john francis kalland was another
beautiful little story radicalite by richard
rush murray was a thought-provoking story
might not the supposed ammonium metal have
the same properties as sodium and potassium
we know that the nh radical forms a base
as do sodium and potassium might we

not carry the similarity further it would
need to be kept under kerosene mr murray
stated that it was a silvery metal that carries
the similarity still further but the point i
want to make is this because of its activity
i say that the nh metal would not make a
good catalyst in the preparation of sulphuric
acid i may be wrong i frequently am and
id like to hear from other members young
and otherwise regardless of sex

  i wish to thank you dr sloane on the
help amazing stories has been to me i am
greatly interested in the sciences and a s
has greatly aided me in biology chemistry
and physics that was the case they made
the subjects easy for they provided a founda-
tion to work upon your editorials have
been especially helpful i know that you are
extremely busy but i just had to get this off
my chest

  in conclusion may i ask for correspondence
from the younger members of this magazine

  as regards the art work in the magazine
we feel that morey is in a sense being trained
to what we want and this conclusion is borne
out by our receiving letters stating that he is
improving in his work the names of authors
as you give them simply represent our best
the use of ammonium in the role of catalyzer
while any chemist would consider it prepos-
terous we think is good enough for a fiction
narration it certainly would not do for sul-
phuric acid assuming that you could produce
it we thank you for the last clause in your
letter which we take the liberty of accepting as
good wishes-editor

the question of reprints-old issuei to
dispose of

editor amazing stories

  i have been a reader of amazing stories
for many years but of late i dont think that
it is as good now as it was a few years ago
how about some stories like beyond the
void out of the green prism the
green girl drums of tapajos and be-
yond the green prism

  and why must we have reprints of old stories
by poe and verne when there is plenty of
new material

  in various issues i noticed that some read-
ers ask for old issues of your magazine i
have copies of amazing stories from no-
vember  to date-all in good condition
which i will sell for the best offer cash or
trade

  i hope that you will refer some of your
readers to me for the back issues

a letter from neil r jones

editor amazing stories

  it gives me a great deal of pleasure to know
that professor jameson has been taken into
the hearts of so many readers and i wish to
thank them for their kindly commendations

  i regret that certain features of into the
hydrosphere were misunderstood by a reader
who voices his suit in the february issue i
i feel that i am at fault in that my explana-
tions were not sufficiently lucid leaving appar-
ently too much to the imagination too much
to be taken for granted perhaps i should
have called time out to have been more exact-
ing at the expense of sustained interest
stories of space ships no longer cite the ir-
relevant detail that the floors of the ships con-
tain a gravitational substance the case-hard-
ened science fiction reader knows this to be
a fact just as soon as he finds that the occu-
pants of the ship do not float about in it

  this privilege i may have stretched a point
or two assuming that all minds would follow
that readers would realize that the uchke ap-
plied this same gravitational substance to their
inner world and to their island of light just
as they did to the floors of their space ships
this explains quite obviously why the uchke
plekne and zoromes found no difficulty in
walking about the inner world let me add
however that this artificial gravity did not
extend its field very far from the inner crust
and would have no effect upon the island of
light that is another angle

  ironic allusion is cast upon the professors
cleverness cleverness is relative depending on
what standard you assume i would hardly
call the professor clever professor jameson
has made several hazardous yet foolish moves
his impulsive entrance into the tripeds tran-
sition cube is most outstanding proof of this

  it would really be a lot better if critics re-
frained from misquoting in the discussions
i find that my word hurtle has strangely
evolutionized into accelerate the dictionary
says of the word hurtle impel forcibly-
dash in collision that is exactly what would
have happened if the uchke bombardment had
been a little bit stronger and had been directed
from one portion of the mainland alone instead
of from all directions the island of light
would have been forced rapidly through the
zero intensity of gravity or lack of gravity
acting much like a space ship from which there
had been a rocket release or much closer to
similarity a space ship struck by another mov-
ing body

  the dictionary says of accelerate to
hasten-to cause to progress faster beyond
the initial push there would have been no
acceleration for as forementioned the artificial
gravity of the mainland possessed no attraction
beyond the tops of the tallest buildings and
that is too short a distance to gain appreciable
momentum in short there is no claim in the
story about the islands possibilities of picking
up acceleration no reason exists for worry-
ing the linotyper with integral signs and ex-
ponents nor the patient readers either with
mathematical proof of something which has not
been contradicted

  it is quite true that the inner world was but
an insignificant comparison to the great mon-
strous bulk of the surrounding hydrosphere
something like a hollow buckshot inside of a
solid basketball and it is probable that a zero
intensity of gravity did exist there that is
outside the influence of the uchkes artificial
gravity but however a great hollow globe
such as edgar rice burroughs conceived in
his moon maid i believe is quite another
matter zero intensity would exist in this case
only near the common center of the immense
hollow the objects on the inner surface would
adhere to where they stood rather than feeling
the same gravitational pull from the other side
of the hollow moon assuming for sake of
argument that it is hollow when that other
side is removed more than a thousand miles
distant and after all is but a comparatively
thin crust of material if such attractions were
equal regardless of proximity venus could
easily pull us off the earth and hold us sus-
pended halfway between that planet and ours
drag out your exponents and integral signs if
you will but hearken son of man great mathe-
matical minds proved conclusively long ago
that airplanes could not fly practical experi-
ment knocked these painstaking figures for a
loop

  if you wish to contradict these feasibilities
stressed in the moon maid nothing less
will be acceptable than practical experiment
tangible proof off paper free of theory to
conduct such an experiment you must free
yourself from the earths gravity so that you
will have your gravitational zero intensity in
which to place your experimental objects or
you might invent a gravitational nullifier in
the meanwhile my theory is just as good as
yours i shall continue to believe mine you
probably yours

  coincidentally in the earlier phases of the
same letter reference is made to the editorial
disbelief in flights of the moon this may
occur much sooner than we anticipate com-
pared to the scientific strides the world has
made in the past fifty years i should place
the realization of interplanetary flight no later
than the twenty-third century colonization of
venus and mars if they prove habitable or
conducive to synthetic introduction of neces-

bob olsens ant stories commended

editor amazing stories

  id like to second the suggestion of p s
miller on the skylark series he suggests
putting them in the quarterly complete i
think that is the most sensible suggestion yet
im not in favor of reprints but if you must
print them keep them out of the monthly

  bob olsens story is one of the best stories
on ants that ive had the pleasure of reading
if i am not mistaken he wrote another story
about ants the ant with a human soul
however the new one is the better of the two

  the two serials read as though they will
lead up to a swell ending

to be short the other stories were excellent

  edgar allan poes stories were probably
masterpieces a number of years ago but com-
pared to williamson olsen and c a smith
they are second rate and as far as i am con-
cerned they take up room that could be used
for a more modern story

  by the way moreys cover on the march
issue is swell

  we have had several good ant stories and
one feature of them is that they are far from
monotonous and do not follow in each others
tracks there is a high degree of individuality
in each of them poe needs no defense his
stories are absolute classics you would be
surprised if you would take in the subject mat-
ter of the early issues of amazing stories
and would see the number of reprints which
were then employed poes stories are beyond
criticism and are second rate to the works of no
writer that we have ever had we believe that
no one would be more ready to agree with this
statement than the authors whom you have
named towards the end of your letter we
are glad that you like moreys work it not
only is good but he takes a warm personal
interest in it and the criticisms indicate that
he is doing better work all the time there
is no room in the discussions for all the letters
we receive so when anything is said in these
columns about the opinions of readers we
have more than the published letters-editor

watch out for the
signs of jangled nerves

youve noticed other peoples nervous habits - and won-
dered probably why such people didnt learn to control
themselves

   but have you ever stopped to think that you too may
have habits that are just as irritating to other people as
those of the key juggler or coin jingler are to you 

   and more important than that those habits are a sign
of jangled nerves and jangled nerves are the signal to
stop and check up on yourself

   get enough sleep-fresh air-recreation-and watch
your smoking

  remember you can smoke as many camels as you
want their costlier tobaccos never jangle the nerves

costlier tobaccos

camels are made from finer more expensive
tobaccos than any other popular brand of cigarettes

camels

      smoke as many as you want
      they never get on your nerves
